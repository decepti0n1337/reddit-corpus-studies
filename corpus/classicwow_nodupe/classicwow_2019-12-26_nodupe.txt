Yeah I‚Äôm mad, who wouldn‚Äôt be. I actually play by the rules and am getting outfarmed by bots and afkers.

---
---
Booty Bay ain‚Äôt far away from Gurubashi
---
You're incredibly incorrect lol. 
---

---
Most dungeons/raids I'm not pulling agro on my shaman. 
---
Sure I'm not using it on ony/Lucy but it's amazing on something like Gar/rag/golem/Domo. 22 mp5 on one piece is great at this point. The biggest thing is just not being dumb and ripping agro as a healer which anyone who's 60 SHOULD be able to do.
---
Took me 8 hours to get to revered opening weekend.
---
Came back last week, about 50+ to get from revered to exalted.
---
So, If you're ally, I got some bad news.
---
Just wanted to second that this worked for me as well
---
Ooh ok so I just did some of this I got my engineering to roughly 185 and I have spent about 70g so far. On faerlina
---
PVP server, PvP happened on PvP server, learn to play, go to retail, etc etc.
---
Welcome to the flip side of what happens when you grief the shit out of the alliance for a month.
---
Right, but if you joined two servers, you could keep them semi-separate with layering
---
Weird how that typo didn‚Äôt change anything
---
You have 3 level 1 rogues...?
---
Hi, have you used Questie, or similar addons?  Not that this isn't useful, its just the manual intervention thats needed for each quest seems tedious.
---
Great for target farming though, or maybe hard to find mobs.
---
It's great for tanking and dps. People are just mad they didn't get it
---
What?
---
It's pretty much just a rogue with less down time due to healing and the ability to take on slightly stronger mobs due to hear form.
---
Honestly the hardest bit was the fucking 8-10 bracket where you have no mana after one mob.
---
That is how competitive you have to be. You literally HAVE to afk in between games/sleep during games to stay competitive in bracket 1, especially as a hunter who gets less kills/hour than a warrior, rogue, or ele shaman. Don't know how you concluded there was 'botting' going on. You can try whatever you want, but my gameplay is teflon.
---
I‚Äôd be jumping off cliffs in Thousand Needles just to have fun with glide.
---
Kallic, did they attend to your ticket? The first one I did is going on 24 hours.  I used that blue post and opened a new one with the GM's instructions.
---
Our raids meanwhile had no shaman loot.. Lots of hunter though
---
PvP
---
yeah bots farming black lotus would be an example of them really messing with an important part of the economy.
---
You get all the resist you need from your tier gear, not that you really even need it
---
Something something people get lazy something something
---
I would go further and post your toon as the Tinder profile pic.
---
Ask her if she's into bindings.
---
You can just do 
---
&gt;/tm 8
---
Apparently instead of deleting the paladin drops they replaced it with shaman drops and everyone sees shammy gear all the time (resto gear btw)
---
Your country knows how to supply people their basic human rights.
---
I played with a guy in vanilla that put it on his resume.  He's a really nice guy.
---
I've had similar weird experiences. I multibox. I have 10 chars, and was running them all the get their douse for MC
---
One of the characters was not visibile to the other 9. SHowed on their map that she was sitting at the flightmaster, despite on her client being right there with them... and able to follow.
---
The other 9 were unable to target or follow her though. She was able to buff them, they were unable to buff her.
---
Just reserving names
---
PvP where Stam matters
---
[removed]
---
No, think of it as Baldurs Gate, or Dragon Age Mode for wow.
---
Given GMs do nothing at all about any losses, I'm surprised restore feature works for classic
---
Correct. I had CDL stuff to do before this and wasn't focused on ranking. The first week I'm ranking focused and I get standing 6.. It's not hard. Sorry to hear that you've been trying your best and could only make it to bracket 3 as a hunter. You just aren't top cut. I was told an entirely different story by a GM and that's not farfetched since they are such a large company, so it looks like there are multiple stories and we will find out based on Blizzard's actions which one is true.
---
if you drink moderately you don't need to drink zero.
---
What
---
The game is more than just leveling
---
Gnomish engineering invis trinket works in combat but will not drop combat.
---
Cause it's automated.
---
Open a GM ticket and take it from there.
---
You only slam with a 2h, which attacks slower than GCD.
---
Twice this week my mate asked if I wanted to join him for arena farm, twice I said no because I was tired. Twice he sent me screenshot of him disenchanting it... Different rolls and groups each time so not the same chest.
---
Literally none.  Aoe loot is great.
---
You mean TARREN MILL?
---
Glad this is where I ended up when whitemane queues were instantly shit.
---
On battle.net, there is an external unstuck feature you can use on your character. I've had something similar happen to me, and that worked. Not sure if it will work in this case.
---
That would be too much effort for minimal rewards.  
---
Faster you hit 60 -&gt; faster gold farming -&gt; buy runecloth and turn it in for reputation.  
---
You will spend more time by changing locations and doing green quests, that would be better spend at 60 farming gold\runecloth.
---
Nah man, it means exactly what I think it does.
---
The 'rules' have changed with regards to real money transactions. No one gives a shit if you gamble with in game currencies.
---
It's OK to admit when you are wrong.
---
I would just get questie, honestly. You will be able to see all the quests available to you in the world on the map, and that'll help you travel around and get them all done. Unsure if you can get it to tell you about rep rewards but I'm sure there's a setting
---
Maybe next year you can ask Santa for a PrntScrn key.
---
That's gonna take longer than 24 hours with blizzard's costumer "service"
---
I'd suggest going to the razergore discord.
---
That said most guilds will see if you fit in in a trial period of a week (maybe 2) and once the trial period is over, accept you completely as their own.
---
And trials usually don't get loot/the scraps.
---
Can you recreate this in another part of Ironforge?
---
Say you are in a volunteer leadership roll with a significantly sized team of like-minded people ü§£
---
Atiesh in the house! (forest)
---
I‚Äôd swipe right üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
MANY MATCHES, ON THE LEFT. HANDLE IT
---
Check your email, I‚Äôm sure you just got a job offer from Blizzard.
---
If classic flops unsupported, I (along with thousands of others) will just unsub, not switch to retail. Even blizzard is smart enough to understand this
---
Makes sense, haven‚Äôt tried fury prot yet so I guess thats is next for me.
---
As someone who played resto shaman in wotlk-&gt; mop as a 2600+ player, I rolled shaman for pvp for classic.
---
I subsequently rerolled because it‚Äôs not nearly as tanky as it needs to be for decked out physical dps classes. In that regard, mobility or CC can help but without the enh tree 1s ghost wolf (or instant in later expacs), earth shield, or riptide (all of which I consider absolutely essential for tanking big boi hits), I felt the class wasn‚Äôt what it needed to be. 
---
As such, I think I should have gone druid from the get-go. Bear form and instant mobility along with hots and actual CC with roots is much stronger than a scuffed snare from earthbind that doesn‚Äôt help with the hamstring.
---
I bought crap lvl 10-20 gear enchanted it packaged it and mail it to random peeps. Good for leveling enchanting.
---
What? It is for both sides on the same side. If an alliance has 800k and you have 600k as horde even if you're number 1 horde you're only standing 2.
---
Over the last week, my win rate on horde has been about 50%
---
Anal Garrote
---
Me too, but not because he wants to play video games on Christmas.
---
Imagine wasting your time fucking with a bot that‚Äôs not monitored
---
Oh nice, even better!
---
Do people even read bios? In my experience no one ever reads then and we just talk about our interests when talking.
---
Better to be a guy with nerdy interests than a guy without any.
---
I got in 1 run of undead strat. I‚Äôm OK with it
---
Completely different teams and different markets. While Blizzard would stop short of releasing content simultaneously with a new release, to extrapolate typical release delays as evidence of a delayed patch on an existing title is simply ignorant of how the company works
---
I do not want easy. But it's a real simple fix with a ratio problem. Time is something not everyone playing has a lot of anymore. I'm not 16 playing 12 hours a day anymore.
---
Very reasonable attitude to have tbh, get that scepter and a few runs should get you some nice gear. Good luck!
---
Heart seeker is doing just fine.
---
I'm not using Questie, this is helpful in finding mobs overall. I ran around Un Goro for a few hours spamming this to target Devilsaur's and would often find them on target long before they were in sight (or if they were on the other side of a tree/hill)
---
&gt; Just want hookups? You think you do but you don't, find a gf.
---
This is a hard one.  On the one hand, a gf has emotional satisfaction and steady sex.  On the other hand, you can have a rotating roster of 2-3 girls you sleep with.  I've found that anything beyond three becomes waaaayyy too much of a hassle.
---
Lol brain dead scrub player. Its defonotely not always worth to delay a game until ice lord. Then to wait another half hour for him to push and die.
---
10 organized players can win av very fast and not waste tons of time summoning an NPC that is intended for breaking turtles.
---
Nobody in your Guild will inevitably follow your. Interests back into RL. Chew on the fact that most friendships are transitory in nature and online relationships tend to have incredibly small half lives. Depending on your geography and age group, I would avoid mentioning video games altogether. 
---
Keep it simple- travel pics, interests, what you‚Äôre looking for or sarcastic comments about your height/the world tend to work best.
---
Rules _do_ change, which is why quoting a decade old blue post is pretty stupid when there's an explicit clause prohibiting it in the much newer EULA.
---
You can make up your own interpretation of anything in life if that's your thing, but you'll still be wrong, and people will still laugh at you for being stupid.
---
But that's not my problem, so good luck with that.!
---
you sleep 4 mins at a time during your AVs? Or are you running your afk macro aka hitting? Anyway idc you're a pus so stop crying on Reddit when you cheat too. Merry Christmas
---
That's what most of the game is man.
---
Also on sulferas, also havent noticed them very surprisingly. I think we have a unicorn of a server though, high pop but not crazy,  great horde/ally ratio, lots of guilds progressing, just all around good server
---
Oganized weekly meetings. Assembled long term and short term agendas and goals. Researched and designed novel solutions to problems and road blocks to project completion.
---
Imagine knowing *exactly* everything that is going to be in the game and then being surprised that there isn‚Äôt more
---
Something similar happened with Fallout 76. Multiple developers patching different bugs, and depending on what version they were working on, some bugs actually came back in some updates because they weren't paying attention to version control.
---
&gt; If you try to take it so literally, it can be applied way too broadly.
---
That's the whole point.
---
Ye, the world really works that way. You've watched too many movies bud.
---
He‚Äôs literally asking us......
---
Would be interesting to see the hardcore guilds from somewhere like stalagg come over as Skeram already seems to have an oversized hardcore/semi-hardcore raiding community.
---
Never, ever, ever , ever evereverevererever do that.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt understand versioning control enough...
---
I was disappointed that it was not a rick roll
---
Have you actually ever worked with old code that a lot of people work on simultaniously? You'd be surprised.
---
Yes, they‚Äôre up for a couple days. Til the end of winter veil I think, or that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been previously.
---
Oh hey. What's up?
---
A lot of good that did you, huh?
---
I dont have trouble with hunters as a rogue, but I use skull of impending doom to fuck the scatter trap combo whenever possible.
---
https://youtu.be/CeJ2H3riw4M here is the Kendrick Lamar audio on top of the video version.
---
Of course I can, my dick is what I eat from and my ass is where I walk..dumbass
---
this is nothing, you should read The Last Psychiatrist. lots less math, but way more intense
---
Ran into a weird bug a while back and was able to fix it by deleting the WTF folder and restarting the game. You can also backup the folder by renaming it instead of deleting it. Apparently some character data is cached on your local machine. I‚Äôd recommend trying this. I think there may be another cache folder you can delete too with cache in the name
---
150g on my server to give you a ballpark, but you should keep checking to find a price on your server. It could be a lot more or a lot less, and if you post it for 150 you could miss out on a lot you could have gained by just waiting.
---
I want to say they're available for a couple days, I would think the hard cut off being a week, but it might be less than that.
---
Done QA so yes, usually they aren't touching a server level change for game level issues. This is when that shit goes wrong it's usually a "spaghetti code" level of bullshit.
---
Hit is super easy to get. Devilsaur, wyrm shoulders, Blackstone ring, mask of unforgiven, and bracer slot is already 8. If you're human you should take the bow since you only need 6 anyway
---
U blocked out his name until the very end lol
---
Preach.
---
My girl loathed 'gamer guys' when we matched, but I usually chalk that up to bad experiences and poor understanding.
---
She'd make fun of LAN caf√©s when we passed them and talk about how her friend would sit at home and waste his time all day in front of the PC.
---
For the first few months she thought I was just a busy man, because I was never instantly available for her. And it's true, I was busy... raiding Gul'Dan with my guild.
---
Over time we would discuss gaming here and there and what the appeal is. When she understood the TV-watching parallel and saw how socially engaging it can be, something kinda clicked.
---
She has a level 26 mage herself now and we level together on weekends, reading all the quests as we go. I frequently lose her to herbalism hikes üòÅ
---
Lol at this being downvoted
---
Is AV worth doing from 51 onwards? Is it worth any exp?
---
The horde strat is: pull LTs to bal, don‚Äôt cap SHGY, have one person tank npcs so another can cap baldar GY, take towers and then pull Marshalls 2 by 2
---
Alliance are much favored especially during event. For fucks sake you don‚Äôt even need to kill the marshalls next to drek, you can pull him with snowballs.
---
Are we watching the same video?
---
He's not inviting, or joining the party of that AFK female he has targeted. He invited the gnome that appears before him after the gnome accepted.
---
Waste of time.
---
You think extending the game by 25 minutes  is worth it in 2 of 3 scenarios? Wtf? There are way more scenarios in av where you should just win or lose much faster.
---
Ice lord is honestly fucking awful. 
---
If horde summons him, they either protect him, or he dies.
---
If he dies, its a waste of time.
---
If they protect him, good alliance just zerg drek while your slowly watching him push.
---
Its garbage and claiming its an important tactic is just bottom barrel noob bullshit.
---
What's Tarren Mill?
---
confidence is attractive, Einstein was drowning in pussy.
---
This.  Finding a group for dungeons takes forever, it's a ghost town.
---
This is not true. If you're human or orc you probably don't need hit on your ranged. Also only one weapon has crit on it, Blastershot Launcher from MC
---
Think, 'of all the things I could say about myself here, this is what I'm going to say' . 
---
Then ask what someone reading it would interpret from thinking, 'of all the things he could have said about himself here, this is what he's said' ...
---
Worked QA so yes I do, unless their code is absolute bullshit a server level value shouldn't be getting changed because you touched game level coding without something being terribly wrong. I'll genuinely buy someone fucked up and touched the value or their code is just shit, but "accidentally" happening because of a value change is just nonsense
---
Don't
---
I have a wildly happy marriage so maybe it does.
---
Interesting. We've been able to gather a couple for our guild, pretty good then.
---
Personally I'd be excited to match with another WoW player. Although I'm currently playing retail so you'd likely swipe left. üòÄ
---
I sent feet pics and I just happened to get my mageblade. Coincidence? ;)
---
Yeah I'm not denying that it would be a fuck up, my point was more that those fuck ups do happen.
---
I dont think it helped that alliance had many super competent guilds who monopolized a lot of markets. I hear certain guilds also became very predatory and poached raiders from numerous other guilds to support multiple raid teams ( as many as 6).  I find it ironic that some guilds are leaving the server  for easier ranking meanwhile stalagg will probably become very easy to rank on due to their actions.
---
Mind giving some tips on how to make money off the AH?
---
Hmmm so that vs getting in the Q faster what would yield more?
---
Maybe it's just their sexual and emotional insecurities that push them strive to please you.
---

---
That section of the EULA has nothing to do with gambling in-game currency 1. because in-game currency has no commercial value, 2. they are talking about wagering on the game (for real money) being prohibited, whether or not the local jurisdiction considers gambling.
---
I'm sorry that you can't understand the EULA but unless you have some other rule to show me, I'm gonna be done with this.
---
My man
---
Just wait for the wave amirite?? The amount of bots on my friends list that is still running weeks after being reported (100%) straight up ruined my enjoyment.
---
Oh look at me Mrs OP mage here with all my good raid gear tehe
---
Waiting for the waves üôÉ
---
yesterday was a day off, yet you only got 3k honor the whole day? Why even compete in the honor "ladder" if you're that casual?
---
Yes!
---
R12 will require you to play for 12-16 hrs a day for a month or two probably
---
That's basically what raiding is
---
Yes.
---
Well, you get 2
---
Pieces lf gear at 7 so thats pretty good, but the grind never stops
---
Incendius is pretty balanced!
---
Once you get over 100 you can‚Äôt stop. What if it‚Äôs the next one?
---
Chasing these pvp ranks makes the game not as fun imo.
---
That doesnt matter. By then they are 60 and have sold the account
---
kill many mobs in an area, click on one dead mob to loot - all mobs get looted with one click.
---
Okay? Thanks random nobody for your useless input
---
Horde doesn't do that because it's utterly pointless to even try with 10+ minute queues. Besides if they drop, other players get the spot right away. I've often got into AVs by now where the gates were still closed but I clearly wasn't part of the initial 40
---
I opened my presents, made 4 bandages and logged out.
---
He is the party leader, so he did the inviting. He joins her layer, as opposed to how it usually works.
---
he thinks I'm muslim and that his ranting will offend me. Jjst funny really. Imagine being this worked up over nothing
---
what is this a private server?
---
I think its generally believed that incendius and sulfuras are the two best NA pvp servers.
---
Dude looks like he just had the best fuckin turkey of his life and has slipped into a Christmas state of nirvana. Should be proud of this pic
---
‚ÄúActually gain rep‚Äù 
---
Turn ins: 1 each... 2 each... 1 each..
---
Really?
---
Cool, thanks for the intel. Major windfall for me, pretty pumped but didn't want to rush a sale and cut my profits short.
---
So there are 14 brackets in total, each bracket is a increment of 1k RP, so bracket 6 is worth between 6000-7000   
---
ranking points depending where in the bracket you place and the higher bracket you're in the more RP you gain, but the bracket size gets smaller the higher you go. Each bracket contains a certain % of the of all players that pvp'ed that week, you climb the brackets by getting more honor, this is done by comparing your honor against all others that pvp'ed that week.
---
As you're rank 6 you currently have between 20000-24999 ranking points and each week you will lose 20% of your total current ranking points and on top of that gain whatever ranking points determined by your bracket. So you will lose atleast 4000 ranking points and then add whatever is left over from your gain to determine your new rank. Each rank is 5000 points, so rank 7 you need 25000 rp, rank 8 30000 etc.
---
No
---
It‚Äôs a fucking pug if you need press need. Everything else is bullshit.
---
It does not.  The reindeer does
---
You can also forget AoE farming with no int gear.
---
How is half a rank a flat 2500 when the rank system is dependent on everyones rank ?
---
If it‚Äôs just damaged cords you can just splice them together quickly
---
other players in the queue would get the invite the moment the first 40 dropped their queue spot.   
---
extremely rare mass-AFK on the queue is the only explanation that even makes sense.
---
Yeah, but there is also a point at which too much information is a turn-off.  I would put in my profile that I like anime and D&amp;D, but I would probably avoid putting tons of information about it on there. Unless you do so with everything, it makes you seem like a one-note guy.
---
Some people just have the money to spend.. worse hobbies to have I suppose
---
Paladins, druids, and shaman crush us.
---
We crush rogues and warriors.
---
Mages and warlocks absolutely wreck us in certain situations.
---
We absolutely wreck priests.
---
Look at the tools at our disposal. We get wing clip and improved wing clip for slows with a chance to immobilize melee players. Concussive shot can do the same thing. We get freezing traps to counter melee charges and ambushes, and we get frost traps for slows with an additional chance to immobilize, and we get feign death which allows us to reapply those traps during combat. Deflection and counterattack offer an emergency escape from sticky melee situations, which is useful when combined with the pvp trinket.
---
We have aimed shot and multi shot for massive burst damage against clothies, which can often provide a quick kill. However, we are weak to casters due to weak instant-cast damage abilities and the ranged dead zone. Our best role against caster is in support, by applying serpent and viper sting and using the pet to harass and prevent timed spell-casting.
---
Our high burst damage comes at the cost of making us inefficient during sustained fights. For this reason we do poorly against healer classes, who are typically capable of healing through our damage until we run out of mana. Priests are an exception due to their low armor and relative lack of efficient instant cast heals.
---
I love playing hunter in PvP at 60. We have so many tools in our belt that fights can be highly dynamic, and even in unfavorable matchups we can put up a fight for a surprising length of time.
---
It's a convoluted system that I don't have the energy to explain right now. Google it and you'll probably find a good explanation.
---
uh sure... 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lLt04nr.png](https://i.imgur.com/lLt04nr.png)
---
Depends on server id imagine
---
Ah yeah, you're right. Seems a bit weird for sure.

When your wife gets you a thoughtful gift: let me post this to Reddit for fake Internet points and validation from strangers!

if someone was working on a long term project and forgot to get latest/merge in the file that controls this function. ya it can happen, and often alot. usually it solves itself when someone else with the latest file commit again. really depends on the company their practice.

True that, or is there a dog under the blanket?

I fucking hate this system anyways lmao
---
Thank you for this omg
---
Knows how to watch a YouTube,  and paraphrase, big time bonus. Also, they ain't following you, following the purps.
---
I am surprised that I had to scroll down so deep to see an insightful comment. What you write is 100% true. The "faction balance" for "gamer chicks" vs gamer guys is around 97% vs 3%, so the queue to AV is quite long.... However, those who successfully differentiate themselves (e.g. workout, hobbies, EQ, irl professions) will get a guaranteed shortcut to the irl rank 14 bracket.
---
on cleave fights it might. single target, it wont. DW is too broken when you can just perma heroic strike when fully buffed because of offhand feature.
---
I remember sodapoppin said a mage that used this with other shields was really hard to beat as a druid
---
And as of right now there are three slots with it and BWL isn't out yet, the bracers and trinket are good, but I'd seriously only go for the trinket until ZG, unless none of the other casters (Mages) needed them.
---
Why are you trying to compare anything to FO76? That game has been an absolute trash fire built on broken game engines and broken internet functionality just in general since day 1. Blizz may do dumb shit once in a while but nothing compares to the sheer incompetence that is Beth's handling of FO76 from top to bottom
---
Kromcrush is an awesome server
---
I love the corsair scimitar, but I had to replace it this year due to a wear and tear double clicking issue.
---
Nah, alliance gas blade of kill. It‚Äôs equally bad as I‚Äôve played both sides on lvl 60 toons on arugal.
---
Idk what kind of AVs you're in, but in US East Horde, it's a bunch of flaming and yelling. It's actually pretty funny.
---
Your mate is a bastard man
---
Whenever u hit hide I get into the next available usually 2 minutes later max
---
Kinda sad that people are saying 'no' to putting one of your hobbies on your profile due to the perception of what a 'gamer' is. 
---
I say go for it.
---
This
---
Lol dude, that's just Spriest. They're so mana hungry, look at their spell costs. You're also the #1 target for Viper Sting and Mana Burn. You will be oom constantly.
---
Do you know how Spirit works? If you do, then you can see why it's useless in PvP. 100 Spirit vs. 1 Intellect... The 1 Intellect can still be better in some fights because you never got a chance to stop casting until it was won/lost.
---
It is
---
It's 11
---
How do you kill the pat that heals himself in the gy? I tried to do this at 45 but the pat just healed through all my damage.
---
You also don't need 300. I'm at 295 for quite a while now. Probably could've stayed even lower.
---
Back tf off kirby. He my puffy boi
---
Strafe sideways. My backpedal has been unbound for years
---
Counter spell the heal
---
Lol OK mate we get it, you do the sex with women.
---
It's sharding which is indeed very similar tech to layering except for the opposite use.
---
Now that's a hole in one.
---
Ohhh boy are you wrong.
---
It would be even bigger if you were a gnome. Everyone hates gnomes.
---
Might be able to snag Anathema since it‚Äôs priest exclusive. That‚Äôll give you a solid base to add in damage vs. survivability.
---
My level 47 mm hunter has crit Aimed shots worth 2k hp on leather &amp; cloth classes. I like it. IMO if you can manage to open up on player youll win.
---
PVR wise I know in raiding their consistently average dps, BM is the prefered PVE spec for consistency.
---
Not so much anymore, now that I am fat and old. But when I was working out every day and spending a bunch of time and money on broads, I sure did.
---
They logged out.
---
It's worth it to get exalted rep, not for XP.
---
Theres no rinsing involved in the honor game. If you stop to rinse you'll never rank.
---
Maybe on your server, but on mine Greater Eternal Essence is 6g. That's a chance for 12g. I almost always just DE those. The weapons are often about 2-3g. Definitely worth the DE over the long haul.
---
Each week I get maybe 100k honor in 3 days. Then realize I will need like quadruple that by Tuesday so I give up Friday to Sunday so I can play another 30 hours of mindless premade AVs.
---
Tell myself I will take it easy next week. The cycle then repeats.
---
Lol "this is the gayest thing I've seen in a while"
---
Doesn‚Äôt it despawn after 15 minutes?
---
Ya it can, trust me, I've seen the messes like Aliens Colonial Marines where them using the wrong identifier broke all of the enemy AI making that game an absolute shit show. Or just the "spaghetti code" that is things like LoL before all the overhauls to it and even still. I'm just not willing to buy this particular excuse is all. A person making a fuck up and touching something they shouldn't have or this being some sort of DDOS countermeasure that didn't turn off afterwards I'll accept, but this is a BIG fuck up if it's just an "oopsie".
---
*eyy bby you looking for loot? Cause I got epic pants and I'm ready to drop them.*
---
Nah. Ranking only requires time. One very high ranker on our server turns using arrow keys.
---
or he's thinking about the meal he just gulped down. i mean look at his belly
---
Mage isn't top DPS anyway. It's fury or rogue.
---
Ele shaman can solo, but it's easier with another ranged dps.
---
Nobody is getting their whole guild to spend 25 bucks to transfer to the exact same server
---
It's an entirely different kind of accident, altogether.
---
I‚Äôm sure it would be /cast whatever it‚Äôs called and /cast the same but for the other and put that button in you action bars or bound to a key

These people are clueless m8.. good effort but op will for sure pick ibs because it's an immediate upgrade

Literally any class is good at pvp

I think its pretty clear I'm not really sure how the system works lol.
---
I wrote in another reply I ofcourse die not expect to get a very high rank right away, just that I didn't expect it to be this low either considering how much I played, but I got it pretty quick from these other replies why that was the case here in the start of honor in classic.
---
I‚Äôd say Holy Reckoning is still pretty good for having that extra bit of damage as a healer. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd go 2hander or Sword and Board by it‚Äôs still strong regardless

If you honestly feel like raid leading is a large part of who you are then go for it. If she is into it then she is into it. If she is not bothered by it then she is not bothered by it. She might think it‚Äôs awesome. Whatever the outcome, if it‚Äôs who you are then own it. I have found that the woman I have dated are attracted to the fact that I am passionate about something and not afraid to show it.
---
It has nothing to do with rationality. Most people like to hear about something you're passionate about, even if they are not interested in it.

But then again there's someone in the chat looking for ''zf xp carries''. I'm wondering, were there such things back then?
---
I started on this server. Made it to 31 and said fuck this.
---
Honestly, knowing a guy has similar interests is really fantastic on tinder or any similar app if you're not sure what to start a conversation with. I'd definitely try to match someone who played WoW as well.
---
That's definitely the vibe I've been getting! I've been loving it so much.
---
We know lol. Mentioned several times in this thread. We are talking wPvP. The arena where boxers shine.
---
People still really don't get what a GM is. Do they really believe GMs are fucking players who have a 60 Char on a Server and play it with GM Rights? Seriously?
---
Best balanced?
---
Take it to the next level by only targeting mobs that are alive
---
`/target Darkfang`
---
`/run SetRaidTarget("target",8)`
---
`/stopmacro [nodead]`
---
`/targetlasttarget`
---
Have a blank target when you spam this macro and it will only target mobs that are alive
---
Yeah about 14 hours should do it.
---
I had up to 35% Miss, but 64% is really unlucky. Your average Miss shouldn't be over 20% overall.

What is the Strat Live Orb greeding etiquette?
---
Yesterday I went to my first ever orb hunting, but there was no specific rule set in advance - no orbs reserved or no "RR" mentioned. I won the first orb. When the next one dropped, I decided to ask what to do: one guy told me to pass, another one told me it is okay to greed again two others did not say anything... Of course I passed, but is that really what others do when no rules are specified?
---
I can keep greeding only if "rr" is explicitly mentioned? otherwise people usually let each other get one orb?
---
You are mistaking Cross Realm Zones, aka Sharding, with Layering. Layering only exists within the server you join, and its just multiple copies of areas of players within that server. Sharding (which you see in Retail today) creates instances of zones with no direct server affiliation, and instead pulls from pools of servers to "fill the world", which is how you can get two people with the same name, but with -servername next to it.
---
I do not currently have a shift mod set up.  The black bars are from adjusting down the resolution on the stream
---
I think you should look up some videos or guides of the system, but I think a realistic estimate would be that you need to grind the way you did for probably another 3 months to get where you want to be. Maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less depending on how the brackets actually work out.
---
And yes, most people that know how the system works think it is absolutely terrible and one of the worst pvp systems ever.
---
They are fun and good at both.
---
Just see your opponent first.
---
And BM is super underrated.
---
Vael is a gear check almost immediately
---
Just ask before you guys start?" You guys cool with RR?" , It's that easy.
---
If nothing else was agreed on you just keep greed rolling.
---
Just right click once, then dont move
---
Sharding refers to spliting the load on a server over seperate instances. Layering is sharding that keeps you on the same instance when you change zones. 
---
In retail servers were merged, and to avoid name collisions people keep their server name attached to their name.
---
There is no afk macro bot. You don't need to do any afk magic. Bind your keys and put a weight on the keybing and sleep beside it with the music on and your headphones on. Enjoy a bracket 1 next week if you can handle the stress.

Hey alright, shut the fuck up, and thanks.

My fiancee has mentioned several times that I was able to get her attention on tinder by going into the detailed rundown of the civil war in Elder Scrolls Skyrim. She said "Damn! I like this dude, hes not boring. Even if it doesnt work out I got a friend who's into the same things as me" something like that. Does it hurt your numbers? Probably, but being authentic will get you someone you're actually compatible with.

‚ÄúStill playing that nerd shit huh cock sucka?‚Äù

Buy all the coper ore you can and smelt it for a head start. I think silver is the last smelt that will give points - and only a few at that.

Yeah, even if someone isn't into the thing you're passionate about, anyone with empathy will enjoy what you're saying and be turned on/into you.

Because when we horde find out about them being premade, we ninja SHGY to reset the fight while O team chip away their bunkers. So now in response to that, they just straight to Drek.

I need to find my way into the ally premade discord to put down names and screen names to check if its premade.

That's not what I was asking. Swing timers aren't a multiple of the GCD, so unless I'm misunderstanding the only way to time slam so it ends the same time as most swings is spending a while not using abilities. If you're attacking at 2.7 speed (say a 3.4 weapon and flurry) and use an ability as soon as you swing, you've now got 1.2 seconds to go until the next attack and can't time slam for it. If you solve that with 3 points of improved slam your GCD is now finishing 0.3 seconds after your swing and you're back where you started.    
---
    
---
So as far as I can see the only way to time slam to go off at the end of your weapon attack is to either use a 3.9 speed weapon or not use any other abilities after your swing and activate slam 1.5 seconds before the end of your swing timer, and I'm wondering if either are worth it.
---
I think people will be able to get through AQ casually after learning the fights for most of it, but they won‚Äôt be able to clear through it as easily as MC for example. For Naxx however, people‚Äôs reality are gonna be shocked by how much time investment it will take to prep for it if you plan on clearing it every week. Most guilds probably won‚Äôt be clearing the frost wing after 3-4 months of it being out. It purely takes too much time investment for casual players to even do the raid. There‚Äôs a reason why like 5% of all guilds back in Vanilla even cleared the raid.
---
Oh shit, what happened? What did you say?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a no for me dawg.
---
And also don't hit any of the uncountable "red flags" in the minefield that we're going through trying to get to a 2nd date.
---
Assuming you don't get hit for 30 minutes. It's good in niche scenarios.
---
Rather than deserved think optimization. If a fury and rogue both want Core Hound Tooth at 1 and 2, I may be inclined to vote towards the rogue still winning at 2 because of the level of upgrade and the spec optimization. That make sense?
---
It definately helped me :)
---
I think **Y**ou should **E**xpect nothing, as this **S**hould not happen
---
True, although I heard rumblings during the beta that this method might work with dual-wielding Deathbringers to achieve 1600 dps, which turned out to be much worse when it was found that Deathbringer doesn't scale with +spelldmg anyway.
---
Man, I'm such a trash mage. I tried farming ZF at 60 and it took me 2h and like 10 deaths to do it twice.

Maybe your BWL clear will win you some bonus points with someone, who knows.

It's obviously used for the mana regen :P
---
This exactly. I got HoJ after about 150 runs of doing arena, angerforge and occasionally golem lord. Then I proceeded to a total of about 260 arena runs to finally get it. 
---
The run that I actually got HoJ was a ‚Äúwe have time for one more quick run before MC‚Äù for which we were late but I had my HoJ. 
---
I got sgc on my first run of the day. I remember seeing Gorosh and thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way this is it‚Äù. But it was. So I guess just keep going and you‚Äôll get it!

I think that this is **N**ot going to. Happen at all, because this wasn't the case **On** the reference client blizzard used.

What advise are you looking for? We can‚Äôt really fix the queues for you.
---
Maybe log in 20 min or whatever your queue time is before you are ready to play and join the queue...? 
---
I usually log in and join the queue then I have time to shower and make food or whatever while I‚Äôm afk waiting
---
"If you're not fit, we're not a hit. I'm mostly only attracted to slim or petite women." Or similar.
---
I guess I'm just shallow and have unreasonable wants given my looks, age, socio-economic resources and social skills.

This. Also join a twink guild, help level and gear, it's an awesome thing.
---
Ques won't get better, but worse. Ally will always have instant ques because sweaty neckbeards had to be us mages/rogue's and orc warriors. Honestly just que and chill. Horde pvp more because they have to, while alliance pve there way into ranking
---
Reason for those 2?
---
That's also bellow vendor for rune
---
You lose avoidance when you strafe. Backpedalling during evasion/deterrence/sword and board is optimal
---
You do realize mage blade is a one handed weapon? :D
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure why the queues are as they are.
---
Is it because there are way more horde queuing than alliance ?
---
If yes then it‚Äôs unlikely ever changing and making a ally toon might make sense.
---
If no then there might be another fix or no fix idk.
---
Oh an undead mage. What a surprise. Haven't seen one of these on quiet some time.
---
I mean no one here is considering the potentiality that it's *multiple individuals*
---
It took about 120g worth of materials for me to power level, and then about an hour of iron/Mithril farming thrown in.
---
How is this better then mageblade? Even the dagger from SM with the AV exalted book are better then this
---
We all know what a golden shower is. It‚Äôs unclear why someone would feel bad for knowing what it is. It‚Äôs not exactly an unknown thing.
---
Never said pvp was the issue i stated that I had no idea how the alliance side and I have no issue with people doing whats best for them what started this whole mess was xfers being an option from the get go alliance players got annoyed and left to heartseeker where the same thing is happening but reversed it sucks but thats what happens when one side doesn‚Äôt get to have fun and I get that. I never raided any of the cities and a bunch of assholes ruined the expirience for the alliance. Whats done is done and if we become the second flamelash thats what happens. Idk how the server wouldve been without all the xfers to heartseeker.
---
I dont recall my guild running into that issue, or at least no one has made a fuss if it has. We do have specific slots for OS items to they dont conflict with other people's MS. Its possible our RL is screening them and sorting out issues like that before the next raid.
---
excellent bait, you're definitely going to catch a few here
---
To rank 10 on any decent server pop you will have be in the 9 bracket group for like 6 weeks. That's over 10 hr days for 7 days. Lol rank 10 is a joke on whitemane
---
In the PVP tournaments they do fine. But you have to utilise every single trick in the book/trinket/engineering etc.
---
Congrats and merry Christmas!
---
That's probably exactly what they're doing, and this is the result of a bad config push.
---
Typo in the flag name causing the real flag to revert to it's default setting, or some such.
---
The only dps class that might need FR is if you have a competent ret pally that wants to grind some FR gear out in order to stay in and be the solo pally giving FR Aura to the tanks on Flamegore. If not, you'll need other Paladins (if Alliance) to rotate out to give aura to the tanks.

---
Mage #7 reporting for duty.
---
Fair. I don't think we even had queues after the first set of transfers, everyone saw that incomplete census data and freaked out.
---
The rank points you get on a weekly reset are based on your bracket, which is based on your percentile of honor compared to everyone else in the pool on your servers faction. These rank points accumulate weekly and also undergo the decay. Every rank after the first one or two is 5000 rank points. Rank 14 is 60k, 13 is 55k, and down it goes by 5k increments.  Thats why going up each rank is more difficult,  because of the decay and that you will need to end up in higher brackets to not only match the decay but beat it and move up weekly.  But one of the parts of the system is that lets say if you take an entire week off completely,  you can only have a net negative of 2500pts, which is half a rank.
---
Ok. I myself play an undead rogue, raiding Ony+MC
---
However, more women play alliance due to the aesthetic of night elves and humans. They are pretty toons
---
So less female you will impress in horde.
---
If i see that in tinder, it will definitely pique my interest. 
---
However, after thinking about all the nights i hear my raid lead yell at me, bossing me around, getting priority loot just because... despite the fact i top dps charts. It gives me ptsd knowing ill de dating a THAT kind of guy. 
---
On the flip side, it may work on your favour. When I played alliance a long time ago, there were females who flirt with the raid lead because they are shit in the game. So yeah. 
---
It will work. 50/50
---
or he's just BSing lol
---
Keeping the classic vernacular alive.
---
if people are ignoring me for that let them ignore me then. ignoring people so easily is very bad for you since there are only few players that play the game every day and when you are so quick to ignore others you are making it harder for you to find groups. maybe not in some huge servers like gehennas but i see same people all the time on Earthshaker for example. that's why i don't ignore people so easily unless they are hard spamming or annoying me in whispers.
---
Theres a lot of right answers but warlock priest is pretty dope

How do you do it? Im impressed.  Is mana a problem?

thank you, finally someone being useful on reddit for once

Someone doesn't tank or play a melee class.

Yea for the mana regen, its 22 mp5, that‚Äôs huge. And if you do get hit in Mc it will fall off instantly, so you can just pop it back on. Once it falls off again you can just swap back to something better üòÇ
---
I'll bet you a stack of Arcane Crystal that Classic is running on the same server back-end as Retail, but with `max_realms_per_shard=1` in a config file somewhere.

25% from Orc racial 15% from protection talent but most people don't take it..so just 25% usually.

Lol, you all are delusional and know it‚Äôd be bullshit if some random dude rolled in your stuff.  Announce what you‚Äôre rolling for at the start of it‚Äôs not the roll your playing in the instance.  Everything else is scummy

Back in the day I manage to get rank 11 with around 300k each week, some weeks more then few weeks nothing, so yeah 300-350k should be enough!
---
I dunno, a lot of t1 items are true upgrades from pre-bis. You don't HAVE to get 8/8 to get benefit from it
---
In reality what exists is variability. Sometimes they read them, sometimes they don‚Äôt. Just play it all by ear and write a bio like you‚Äôre writing a cover letter. You write down what will help you get what you‚Äôre looking for.

I only play Warriors and have had S unbound for years.

There's no point to it if you're good. You can strafe which is maximum move speed while facing the mob.

Best solo gold-making class to make (alt)? I want one of my alts as an alchemist so yeah.

I like the round robin idea because the list we are going for will have a manufactured round robin feel

Yep. Took me about the same to get HoJ. It's a very quick farm atleast so I just kept at it periodically while working on other preBIS

That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt keep cum as pets

Copy your main character folder to your new character to retain the settings. Most add-ons are cool like that.

AGM isn't as special if I let other people have it too.
---
i 3 box alot and every now and then 1 of the characters will be seeing things totally different than the other 2even tho they are all within 5 feet of eachother.
---
That was pretty shorthand, I meant that once you were loaded in raid tier you have to stay 8/8 before you really move up. The ramping is small from tier to tier so Hunters don‚Äôt benefit as much to where they may want to break their bonus for the next tier until you‚Äôre 8/8 again
---
Wow bots are much easier to detect, that's true.
---
how does alliance win in av?
---
The 25% is only = to an additional 2.5% to your total stun resist without any talents.
---
If you're good, then they're good. They're doing better than Shamans in the duel tournament (although there's some favourable rules in there).
---
ty skeram
---
Oh yeah I agree on that point 100%. I'm just pointing out that the reason people are saying blizzard are rushing content out is simply because so far that's just objectively what has happened, and I personally don't wanna see the trend of accelerating content release to continue.
---
Guess you might as well wait since your Q time is going to be like 20-40 minutes
---
Pugs don't stop to kill the lieutenants at IB GY.
---
If they're all alliance pugs, someone will be stupid and cap a flag, even if it's iceblood. It happens about 25% of the time when there's even just 3-4 pugs.
---
I did. GM also said they would respond very quickly and at 1 point said within an hour or so.  1 day later and here we are lol ...
---
What files do i need to copy in order for all my key binds and addon settings and such to match between my desktop and my laptop?  Synced up twitch and got all my mods installed, now how do I move the settings?
---
Sure but i wouldn‚Äôt count on it lol, have seen crazy rng stuff like this in runescape that is semi provable in 1 screenshot
---
you probably have to sacrifice 3 goats just to get the wow servers to start back up.  The code is complete spaghetti at this point
---
The problem is buying gold with real money is absurdly efficient. Like, grinding normally gets you the equivalent or 1-4 dollars an hour. Combine that with how useful gold is in Classic and it creates a serious disparity in the playerbase.
---
Your issues or play time is not anyone‚Äôs problem but your own . Change the game because it affects what you want .. that‚Äôs a no
---
BM is more like PoM Pyro. It's good once every 2 min. Also you're probably skipping Entrapment with a BM build, which is so OP in BGs.

Yeah I guess that‚Äôs true!! I‚Äôll have to do that once I get those items. I was just excited to get this nostalgic item. Cheers!

Yeah they fit into retail a lot more because gold already didn't matter when they introduced wow tokens.
---
&gt;Women want honest guys who are comfortable with themselves and their hobbies.

This has not been my experience.  One way ticket to the friend zone.
---
Is that too much ?? Shit.. how much is the enchant supposed to go for?
---
I was having a hard time finding someone who had the enchant
---
I would say its not layering, its just entering another instance.
---
Source its intended?
---
He applied retail math to classic xD
---
Orcs get 30% as all races have 5% base stun resist, which is why everyone went orc for classic lol.
---
this can happen with spellbatching mind control landing on someone who's literally just about to die.
---
If you time it right they still die but end up mind controlled while dead... and it never goes away.
---
Another bug that's in classic that was never a thing in vanilla.
---
Why is spell batching good again?
---
This why alliance so good at AV?
---
I wish there was a tsm light version..
---
The fact that you need to form a group to even the playingfield against one player is what makes it unfair. Multiboxers didn't do anything to deserve that advantage other than paying extra. So yeah unless you find pay 2 win fair, Id say it is pretty unfair.
---
what's dedicated about being there on xmas day?  I was playing some AV and there's a shitload of people on still like early afternoon n shit in that lull between xmas lunch and dinner.

You should take your own advice about not opening your mouth about shit you don't understand since that's literally a big part of a QAs job you stupid fuck, the person who's finding the issues, attempting to replicate, and identify what it is and isolate it for a fix lmao.
---
I‚Äôm almost 60 and still using lord alexanders. That‚Äôs the best if you want to use axes until BRD stuff. Ice barbed spear is better though but you‚Äôd have to train polearms.
---
Source it‚Äôs not?
---
you never want to move backwards, just turn.
---
unbinding the backpedal button is probably a good way of getting in the habit of not using it.
---
nah the imp still did more dmg
---
&gt; You can't. Strafing turns your back to mobs
---
no it doesn't
---
It was just an example. Most people are 30+ now and time is an issue. Regardless if I wanna play the game, assuming I logged out by the battle masters, it takes well over 20 minutes to do a battleground. On top of the time it takes to play. The issue is the time waiting to even go play. I'm not saying make the battlegrounds faster, I'm saying make the que faster for a majority of the players with a very easy fix.
---
Vael is not only a DPS check. If you do not wear FR, the result could be Healers pulling aggro and if they do, everyone dies
---
Not really. Besides, the healers have unlimited mana and are spamming prayer of healing/chain heal 24/7.
---
I won three AVs, one was a two hour game where at one point Horde had our base gy and both towers down and we managed to get south and win, burning all the LTs/Commanders/towers, killing shamans, for over 4K honor. Another we actually got IVUS and again did not have towers or aid station but managed to trinket back, wipe, and go south again and win. 
---
After a week of 80% losses, it felt like a Christmas miracle.
---
there's literally no need to backpedal ever.  You're strafing wrong if  you're getting dazed lol.
---
&gt; There are actually some massive advantages to the old back waddle even in pvp.
---
False
---
How do I know if a bunker is going to get destroyed? How long should I wait?
---
He is definitely handsome.
---
I am "salty" over it because it is cheating. Having software(or hardware) that duplicates keystrokes is pretty cut-and-dry automation of gameplay. Activision/Blizzard allows it because they are a publicly traded company that have shareholders who are smart enough to realize that one person who is willing to purchase 10 copies of the game and pay for 10 subscription fees is a lot more valuable to them than the average player with only one account.
---
Your generalization about people just being mad because they are financially unwell is almost as stupid as assuming that all multiboxers are 13 year old kids using mom and dads credit card. I'm an adult with a good job and disposable income, so is everyone else I've ever spoken to about the multiboxing issue. People dislike it because it is cheating, not because it costs more money.
---
Unless druid tank. Then grace of air is soooooo good
---
Honestly love the subtle detail of not making the angle too extreme, because dwarves are short.
---
This definitely happens. I don‚Äôt know why, but it does. Very noticeable going into Badlands from Loch Modan.
---
How sensitive are you to this? Lol calling someone a scrub for stating facts? A GM said himself that they believe it was possible in vanilla. They also said they know, specifically streamers, are doing this and punishment will not be handed out. Go ahead and believe me or not. Better yet ask a GM yourself, I‚Äôve gotten my information.
---
Not technically, its almost an identical game world. Sure, it sucks that being a blizzard wagecuck GM on their new downsized staff means you're basically a impotent cog in a soulless machine, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be easy for them to crush gold sellers if they wanted to.
---
I mean, you can *eventually* kill a paladin, but it‚Äôll probs take 5+ minutes of kiting without any interference or way to LoS. Rets are doable, but anything else is a pure waste of time.
---
Imagine farming sgc when you should instead use black dragon scale 3pc for similar stats
---
no / no
---
thanks for listing a bunch of shit gear, definitely want to plan on using that stuff.
---
Rules are rules.
---
I disagree with the "you won't be healing much" sentiment. Holy reck should almost always be healing to bait out people to attack you. Get those reck stacks and then kill.
---
Still doesn't make the choice of imp hoj or imp conc aura easier. Personally, I generally take imp conc aura because of just how invaluable it is.
---
Is this post satire? Or are you just actually this stupid to what exactly the job entails? Or where I said "I understand it all" when all I've said to point is "that doesn't sound like the issue, I think something else is more likely unless their code is just shit." Then again you're clearly just a frothing anal rage baby ranting at this point lmao.
---
Be confident about your hobbies and don‚Äôt come off as a creep. 
---
Have photos of you being a fun guy.
---
Yes, the longer AV is out, the less people will play it.
---
You have as much time as you want to actually get the gold for the gear, but rep is gonna take longer and longer the more you wait
---
Its not about who believes what, this method did not work in vanilla you will see soon what happens to exploiters just wait a week
---
go away
---
Sorry you gave up after one GM because I had the opposite experience with a different one.
---
Yes there is. Everyone has 5%.
---
Guildie took over 300. Just got it yesterday. He was stoked.
---
All it takes is a single building or rock to LoS you and the shaman/pally can now deny the kite. Ditto for every other class. 
---
Also good luck kiting/bursting/dpsing through 15-20k effective HP SL locks. That shit‚Äôs even worse than trying to solo kill an hpal.
---
Can someone tell me how I'm supposed to hold aggro as pure dps spec in 5 mans? This subreddit keeps telling me you can tank 5 mans as 17/34/0 but it really sucks. Keeping aggro is so much more difficult and headache inducing then when I have defiance in the prot tree.
---
Yea, it's still nice until very endgame when you are minmaxing.  Enjoy.
---
because of GCD you can't drop them all at the same time, but i do have a cast sequence macro to just spam one key to drop my favorites, hope this help
---
/castsequence reset=3 Strength of Earth Totem, Mana Spring Totem, Windfury Totem
---
No you don‚Äôt.  As long as the enemy is within your camera‚Äôs front 180 degrees while you have RMB held, they are considered to be in front of you.
---
I don‚Äôt have to wait a week, GMs have already confirmed it will not be punishable but they are looking into if a fix should happen. 
---
This will hopefully be like raids farming instances week 1. People do it, blizzard fixes it and no one complains.
---
The question was not ‚Äúcan I play Hunter well specifically as MM spec in MC.‚Äù
---
BM hunters are underrated in PVE and PVP often. And wind serpents allow for ranged attacks. Funny how everyone has to be the big dick information person.
---
I was just answering OP question about hunters. Lol.
---
Have played Vanilla and Classic as hunter. Well aware how they play. 
---
As for your ‚Äúshould be 100+ DPS with a pet,‚Äù the top hunter in the world parses 100.7 DPS with his pet. Let‚Äôs not pretend that‚Äôs normal.

People want to get to know the real you. Is part of who you are and you are a proud of it. So I guess my advice is literally ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù.
---
Corny but I can‚Äôt think of a better way to put it.
---
Did I mention "multiple private servers?" I mentioned LIGHT'S HOPE which is a game team that actually rescued a player base from a Russian duo who run the game team 'Elysium.' I said this is an example of a well moderated game world, not that privates servers are universally fair gaming realms.
---
On Elysium, some gold sellers were banned, others were allowed to run rampant. WhiteKidney was the head admin doing most the work on the server, and one night he copied the entire character database, and allowed anyone who wanted to, to come play on the new "Lightbringer" realm. They could claim their Elysium toons, and start on a realm with Crogge and Shenna selling r14 toons and letting their pocketed chinese gold mafia run rampant.
---
It wasn't long before gold selling was a thing of the past, as its really easy to detect the patterns. Of course, it is near impossible to stop character trading and gold selling by clever individuals, industrial level botting and fishing botting were done for.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers is RP-PVE , you don‚Äôt have to RP but the community is pretty great.
---
I learned my lesson.
---
No one's waiting 20 min for a que then dropping to wait another 20 min. Sometimes premades try like 4-5 timed to get a match right.
---
No one's waiting 1-2 hours for a premade on horde lol
---
I was this chick. Now married to my gamer guy more than a decade. Only stopped raiding when I had a kid
---
Think about the average duration of a PVP fight. It's somewhere in the range of 30-40 seconds. The longest of fights like priest vs mage 1v1 may go on for like a minute and a half.
---
How much mana can you realistically regen from spirit in 90 secs? Not a lot.  
---
Even in a scenario where you know the fight is going to last long such as mage vs priest 1v1 the mage is going to try and exhaust your mana pool by resetting the fight with polymorph and eating/drinking back to full.  
---
No matter how much spirit you have he's deliberately trying to deplete your mana every step of the duel so either you kill him before you're OOM or he wins.
---
In classic PVP the usefulness of spirit is limited because the timescale is too short for it to impact the outcome of most engagements. Min/maxing stam/spell power/int for each slot is optimal for success.
---
Source? I play rogue and i have never had a resist except on Orcs or priests.
---
Even a random nobody is above QA
---
Used for crafting Onyxia scale cloak which basicly will be mandatory for Nefarian in BWL.
---
I ended up getting a 7 day mute for that one too which is the best part. I've previously gotten a 1 mute ban as well when a rival guild explicitly told me in game their entire raid was mass reporting me after we tagged Azuregos and killed it. I was muted for abusive chat for a single message: "lol stay mad idiot." The live chat refused to remove that mute too.
---
The automated system is a joke.
---
And why isn‚Äôt Jail the Stockades?
---
there's no native "resist" versus physical attacks like kidney shot.  Such attacks can be dodged, blocked, parried, and they can miss, but they don't resist natively.  Only orcs and a few talents can grant resistance vs the typical rogue stuns.  HoJ works the way you're thinking, but that's because it's a spell.
---
We usually go if we have 2 healers lol. 5 would be a dream, but rare.
---
I mean you‚Äôre trying to talk down to like half a dozen people in this thread who seem to know more about this than you do lol. I‚Äôm just laughing at your insecurity because I see it all the time in ass pained QA. But if you feel the need to enlighten me about your job duties that make you such an authority that you ought to be educating all these people please do I‚Äôll grab my popcorn.
---
Leave the botters alone you jealous prick
---
Pushback yeah but 20% passive silence resist is very nice.  You can also augment this with voice amp neck and there‚Äôs a couple rings you can stack too.  You can basically become to silence effects what orcs are to stun effects.
---
The battleground closes 2 minutes after the score screen. Not 1 minute.
---
Decent wow players vs filthy botter slime is the real war for azeroth.
---
...someone who had all the mats and the enchant? the mats are expensive, but not 500g expensive, even with a nice tip its probably closer to 200-250g on most servers
---
We had a fun 20v20 AV when this happened on both sides.
---
Yeah, I'm on Herod, but it seems like all of Alli are ranking in AV or not playing. Forming groups seems like a real drag.
---
You rolled the wrong class I‚Äôd you don‚Äôt like healing.
---
It's good cause I can use elemental mastery chain lightening-shock to get them both free and both a crit 100% 
---
Just a nice little 2500dmg in 1.5seconds on a 3min cd.
---
I paid a mage got it first run. Best 200g I ever spent
---
Weeds out the girls who think video games are for children. Also you might find a girl who enjoys gaming as much as you do!
---
"talk down to" you mean the other people who I had a conversation with, came to a common ground with, and both walked away from the conversation where the other person started to consider my point as a distinct possibility, the other that said "ya that's a possibility, but we'll wait and see", and then just you and the one other guy being a dumbass? Those "half a dozen people" I'm "talking down to" you fucking clown? Just shut the fuck up at this point dude Holy shit lmao.
---
Just join an av discord and your win rare goes to 90%
---
Sulfuras SUCKS. Don't go there
---
Meanwhile in reality were all sitting here with high population servers that are holding three times as much as they were originally designed to hold lol
---
Very true!
---
Normal /target macros prioritize living targets.

single target -&gt; sunder&gt;bloodlust&gt;heroic strike

2+targets -&gt; whirlwind&gt;sunder&gt;cleave

^that's my way to do fury tank and ye, this build is supposed to be quite of a challenge :D
---
It‚Äôs the same range as CH at 10 yards but as you said not a smart heal.
---
Yeah and that's only my main! I might need to get a life...
---
Yeah I bought all the mats. Guess I overpayed üòÖüòÖ
---
thanks
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
People says here 150 to 250 gp
---
Idk but it didn't cost me that much tbh
---
yes, it's ElvUI Classic.
---
Your account should just be instantly banned if you type a Chinese character into WoW.
---
14.99?  
---
You are paying too much for gay stuff.  
---
Whose your gay guy?
---
Aside from your math being weird...
---
Flurry increases attack speed, which increase rage gen, on top of attacking more frequently. 
---
Both prot and fury have access to the two most common threat generating abilities (sunder / revenge ).
---
They both have access to the exactly same safe dive talents. (Sheild block/ armour) 
---
Any decent dps in Pre-BiS should out threat a deep prot warrior. Where as they won't a dual weild fury prot.
---
So when threat actually matters you need the ability to becomes better.
---
Yeah sure it is different for each server, but he asked for a target and I gave him one. Sure it could be that on his server 300k is top 10 and on an other server its barely top 200.
---
He asked I answered!
---
Congrats on the engagement
---
Yeah I get it. I‚Äôm talking about full MC runs.
---
But either way, yeah pets with great management and being healed for 22k dmg in a run can do well. But to say any well spec pet should do 100 DPS in MC is a little silly.
---
We‚Äôre just taking about ‚Äúis hunter good PVE/PVP.‚Äù
---
It can be super fun, and does fine. 
---
And most people assume BM is automatically a shorty spec because of MM or whatever. So it‚Äôs underrated.
---
The discord is owned by a control freak admin so beware
---
Well mix some wsg into it and it gets better.
---
That has literally happened to two guildies bc it‚Äôs their off time now (school)
---
gamma so high
---
Good new players community?
---
In pvp this ring is worth 50 stamina and absolutely ruins rage generation, and if yoy get lucky you will get 2 or 3 ticks of the +22 mana. Its one of those items that you keep in the bag to switch in on CD if you have it in pvp
---
Needed about 400.
---
...
---
I do have it now. But I think I can't enter brt without a doctor's assistance anymore
---
well its the 0nly 3% chance to crit item, without it stacking 2% crit on every slot wont work
---
Yeah guess I payed too much for the enchant..&gt;&lt;
---
You guys are aware you‚Äôre allowed to equip items that aren‚Äôt on the bis lists right?
---
I'm with you on this. I'm actually really surprised by all the toxic replies telling people to dedicate hundreds of hours of their life to a reroll like this isn't just a simple team balancing issue in a video game that Blizzard could fix with a simple patch.
---
I'm an adult that casually plays this game. I genuinely don't have time to wait 30+ minutes in queue to play a 10 minute games of WSG/AV. It's not enjoyable and a shitty use of my time. So is dedicating countless hours to reroll and abandon my friends.
---
I play horde on a balanced server. I didn't know there would be cross-server BGs with queue problems when I signed up for classic because that information was buried deep in some one-off blue post.  It was not common knowledge. Sure... if I actually had that info in August I may have made a different decision? Either way that isn't helping anyone. 
---
They need to introduce same-faction BGs. I'm honestly likely going to quit the game soon if they don't fix this. WSG/AB were the main reason I picked Classic up and it's pretty much ruined right now.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt quite understand. Could you elaborate?
---
Oh be quite
---
Dude it dude. It'll help you match with someone you'll enjoy spending time with. Complete the ultimate quest and find yourself a WoW gf
---
I posted this on the subreddit
---
Imagine you had a ring which gave you +50 stamina. That is how good it is in pvp. Once encounter is over, and ring is on cd, switch to another ring for the next encounter, you'll be able to have +50 stamina every 30 minutes which if you play enough will defenitely make the difference at times, especially when blocking warriors from generating rage :)
---
Regarding PvP,
---
As a raid-geared seasoned hunter who's been playing a lot of AVs--mages and shadow priests give me the hardest time. Once they get into melee range, you have 5 options:
---
* Scatter shot -  To interrupt a spell (and get distance if applicable) 
---
* Feign death into a freeze trap - Feign to 'interrupt' the spell and the trap to get distance. Most of the time the mage will iceblock out of it. 
---
* Wing clip proc (immobilize) - to distance myself
---
* Viper sting - to drain their mana pool ofc
---
* Raptor strike - to simply do damage
---
Even using all of these options the mage/Spriest will often lock you into place and/or burst you down before you even get to minimum range or oom them. 
---
Warriors and rogues can also be challenging as well. 
---
Ultimately, it's a matter of maintaining your distance away from the enemy (regardless of what class you're up against) so you can keep popping your shots off. However, it can be strategic at times to do an 'in-out' strategy where you go in wing clip the target then back out.
---
3 days from the time the boss dies. Timer resets on server crash/maintenance, meaning they can spawn at any time following maintenance or outage.
---
This led to an interesting week around Thanksgiving where we had 4 Kazzak spawns and 3 Azuregos spawns on my server. Who wants to be with family when you can camp world boss spawns 24/7?
---
You're on an easy server if these are br1 and br2! (Or 14 and 13 for backwards counters).
---
br3 would typically be 650k to 700k with those numbers.
---
The armor has 14 agility, 14 strength (28 base AP) and 2% crit.
---
When combined stat wise with the agility, that's about 2.7% crit chance which is pretty nuts on a single armor, while not sacrificing much strength and stamina.
---
Guess you don‚Äôt know how to remote log in with your phone when you are a couple of hours out
---
If you are strafing directly away from a person/mob they will be hitting you from behind
---
You an Aussie?
---
We run 25 mans pretty easy... First GDKP pug next week, you can definitely carry 15 ppl, not just 5. How bad is your raid if you think you can carry only 5 thru MC?
---
Doing what Horde does: destroy Iceblood Tower and Tower Point (horde always destroys bunkers; alliance rarely does; they harass players trying to catch up to the zerg constantly) and leave a small focused group to defend (5-10 people, horde always defend and stop the alliance zerg dead in its tracks, Alliance rarely defends base). And actually wait for Frostwolf Relief Hut to get captured (alliances captures something and then forgets about it).
---
ohbby
---
Really fun in both if you utilize all your skills. Theyre better than warlocks and compete with mages through the end of bwl. You also get the occasional kite duty and tranq shot and your rotation is more than spamming shadow/frostbolt.
---
Raid prep is cheap and easy. Don't need a flask unless your rl requires titans.
---
I'd swipe on that.
---
i literally just wish there was a version of their interface for professions lol
---
bis on shaman would be healing gear
---
how do they lose?!?
---
Farm for consumables, buffs and other items to get it down to sub 30 minutes.
---
LF1M, need hots not dots. 9/10 MC (but it's 1.12 so lol)
---
This is my main argument for wanting to stray away from this system. Justification across 600+ items is bound to loop around itself and invalidate two items being justified for the same purpose with two different reasonings (logic equation here). I‚Äôd rather stay MS&gt;OS free roll, or rely 100% on the loot list rather than interfere. Only justification needed is: ‚Äúhey highest roll main spec‚Äù, or ‚Äúlook you had time to work with your class and you chose as a team not to build lists together‚Äù.
---
Before honor was released there were hunters soloing dragonkin in basically every area they were in.  I was kind of curious if they would still exist after honor, because if they really are bots they'd essentially be free honor.  I don't see any alliance ones anymore, but I still see a few horde.  To be clear, I don't know for sure that they're bots, but I herb a lot in azshara, and it's kind of strange that there's literally always a hunter farming there.
---
Find songflower- 10 mins, DM Tribute cycling, 15 minutes, wait for Rend buff, 5 minutes. What else can you gather rn lol
---
LOOL
---
We actually have some pretty cool tanks who are sharing loot and making sure main got beefy enough to carry even without full BIS
---
Benediction isn‚Äôt bad either
---
i dont think its as cut and dry as you are making it.  im willing to hear your points.  for reference, i exclusively alliance premade on the cross server discord and each week my winrate has been going steadily down.  i would estimate it around 70% so far this week (roughly 40 games?).  while that may seem a bit a high, remember these are PREMADES.  they are fairly unorganized premades, but technically most of the people are in voice, even if only a few are talking/listening to calls.
---
from my perspective, if all things are equal, alliance have a slight advantage.  but there are a few factors that shake up this imbalance to where I think it may even be horde favored at this point.
---
most of these imbalances stem from queue times as many have mentioned.  this has a few drastic effects.  first it makes people not give a crap about the game, attracting lower levels, people not interested in pvping, and afkers.  second it makes premades popular for alliance, further separating the population of competent players and worse players.
---
those two effects are the obvious and uninteresting ones.  where it gets interesting is when it comes to player mentality.  there is no question that alliance have a bit of an advantage in terms of pure offense.  if both sides run past each other and dont interfere, alliance wins the majority of the time.  and everyone knows that, we saw it the first 2 weeks.  the problem is that the balance of power is absurdly in the defense's favor in AV.  so, even though alliance have an easier time on offense, their mentality of wanting to be the attacking side always puts them on the losing side of the battle.  the horde just throw 25 people on defense and have 15 people slow roll push offense, and its surprisingly effective.  i havent done a non-premade av in like 3 weeks, but i would be shocked if alliance had a &gt;5% winrate at this point.  EVERY game is a turtle of 20+ horde holding galv/IBGY.  and even with 25+ in voice and attacking reasonably together, we sometimes cant break their initial turtle at the GY.  and even when we do they still can fall back to drek and returtle up.  similarly, drek/van shenanigans are WAY more punishing against the offensive team (ie, alliance).
---
the alliance could change their tune and switch to a defensive stance, copying the horde... but i dont see that happening.  besides, every game would be 2+ hours.
---
They have profession windows. But maybe it‚Äôs not in classic?
---
You're garbage

no, when BWL came out ragnaros world first was like only 2 months before so MC wasn't really on farm at all and the MC loot update came very late.

People went in BWL pretty much with dungeon gear and a few mc epics

Most of the old wow pvp vids are entertaining but they dont really showcase skill. Check out the first 3. They are gods.
---
You raided on Xmas day?
---
Yes this is the answer !
---
His duel videos are probably the best. Other ones, not so much.
---
Please don't do this.
---
I would appreciate the reference because I play also, but personally the fact that you lead it or randomly join pugs group doesn‚Äôt change anything.
---
Pass lead back to main, pass lead again back to alt usually fixes this.
---
Consider using positioning so you can spam holy nova.  Tons of raid healing, adds some dps, and causes no threat at all.
---
Ring is ass in PVP, if you're losing to the common melee classes (rogue, warrior) in 1v1s that's a you problem and not a gear problem. Mages have so much control and lockdown that you can easy kite and kill melees if you don't get initially bursted. The Freezing Band is a 1% proc, you can't rely on it to turn the tides of a fight.
---
Vs casters Stam/int ring is much more valuable than sp ring, and that's where Freezing Band really lets you down IMO. If you raid and get competitive over parses, then it's worth it- every thing you do to boost spell power in your setup is worth it because of the extra 100% crit damage from talents. But otherwise, there are so many better rings for PvP and for non raid instances the marginal sp difference is not really worth
---
1 month spacing is very unnecessary people are usually done(in the sense that it's not fresh and gets boring) with retail patchs 2 weeks in.

Whats AGM
---
In my guild we have a fully pre-planned list of who gets what item in what order. I had never seen anything like it before, and I gotta say it's probably one of the best solutions I've seen. The guild officers are each responsible for maintaining their list, and after creating the initial list they discussed it with the members. 
---
One of the absolute best advantages about it is that any and all possible loot drama gets removed from raid night. We've had the discussions beforehand and everyone knows exactly what will happen. And there's not really any loot whoring issues or people "playing the system". Ofc some people will get geared quicker than others based on what drops, but some good pre-planning from the leadership and people knowing their time will come eventually has kept dissatisfaction to a minimum.
---
It also makes raids very smooth since we just have the ML pick up everything and trade it accordingly as we clear our way to next boss.
---
Holy. So is it a comp reading the quest automatically. Or did you record every quest individual? 
---
Sounds amazing.
---
KendallJenner and Kakarott are two horde bots that farm the shellfish traps in Desolace. They've been there for months and still haven't been banned even after the flurry of reports I've sent in. Blizzard really doesn't care to ban accounts unless you do someyhing really bad.
---
&gt; and by that point they had 90% of the game knowledge we have now 
---
...no
---
Probably like 30%
---
LOL
---
Imagine not saving wow screenshots as TGA instead of JPG in 2019.

And with this comment you've revealed yourself as someone who doesn't know enough about the game. This isn't 2006 anymore, things have changed and real tanks mix mitigation and threat depending on situations. HoJ is just as much of a tank item as it is a DPS item.
---
It's on the twitch app just search dbm pvp
---
Thank you good sir. I appreciate it !!
---
I am very surprised by the reception of my post   T_T lol
---
Tbh, raid leading is not something you should advertise on tinder. Do advertise it on a resume.
---
Any gamer chick who knows what taking on a guy who has 12+ hours of his free time committed to WoW will immediately back off and move on to some one who has time for her.
---
Better to be the busy guy, who gradually introduces his second job, and how important it is once she knows you better. 
---
Tinder is all about first impressions. It's best to show the most interesting part of you. Instead of saying, "I raid lead in an MMO" say "my lads and I slay fire Giants at my command"
---
Thanks man.
---
It is text to speech reading each quest. Like I said in OP I used different tts for each race and sex to spice it up.
---
I tried doing voice acting at first for fun, but it just took way too long to edit and record everything, so I programmed a bunch of stuff to get it to work. Its a shame too, I loved doing the transatlantic accent for the Hogger quest.
---
Better have decent gear, I‚Äôm not giving a poor tank in greens the first orb when I end up tanking the mobs on my rogue.
---
Use FAP against rogues/hunters. Make sure you run around in deadzone vs hunters and dot. Should be an easy win.
---
Thank you kindly partner
---
You just look at the time it takes verses the benefit of having it.
---
it feels like 100% tbh, i spend repentance, hammer, nade etc and some orcs just resist everything
---
you need a ; after the fire ball rank 2
---
/cast [mod:shift][mod:alt] Healing Touch(Rank 2); [nomod] Healing Touch(Rank 1);
---
There's nothing unreasonable about having tastes, but in another comment on this thread you mentioned diminishing op's options by being too honest. Being negative in any way - particularly about physical attributes - is a surefire way to do just that. You can decide for yourself if you're attracted to someone on a case-by-case basis - no need to filter them out beforehand by looking shallow as a puddle. This is why you see men complain about women's bios that say "6'+ a must." It's the same thing. Also, you made it rhyme. "Don't be fat. I don't like that." Did you honestly think someone would think that was cute?
---
Yep, and blizzard gains garbage dmg from spell power compared to hard-cast spells.
---
In short, they get an alt account to queue up by itself, then when the BG ends, they invite the previous raid into that alt's queued raid and get in quicker. Basically, the alt is getting in line while they're inside, then they take the alt's spot in line, ahead of everyone who queue'd while they were still in there.
---
Never done it, but I've heard some rumors that /use instead of /cast can cause odd problems. Been a long time since I heard that tho, don't even know what problems.
---
I plan to buy orb of deception and bartered a deal with someone for it for 100g. Im fine with this price. The question is do I use it on my 60 lock or my 60 warr?
---
God damn that‚Äôs spicy.
---
It‚Äôs all rng. I got lucky and got it on my third time in arena or something close to that. Meanwhile I‚Äôve done well over a hundred runs and I‚Äôve only seen HoJ once and lost.
---
There's not supposed to be more than one "instance" per server.
---
Much appreciated! &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm having a blast replaying classic xD
---
Assuming you're competent with the class, warriors are the hardest to level but the easiest to gear as a main tank or off tank when you finally finish your pre raid BiS and progress into raids.  
---
MT/OT roles always get loot priority over DPS and have fewer slots than most other roles in a raid team.
---
Druids are 100% probably the easiest class to gear out in Classic, though. Most of their BiS is class specific to only them and a raid group won't take more than 2 or 3 at the most. (I'm speaking Resto druids here, a healer.)
---
Warlocks are fairly easy to gear out and level as. No more than 4 in a raid comp and usually only 3.
---
It's definitely not grammatically correct. It's slang to denote a transient, often emotional charged state.
---
Got my buddy his today. Took us about 55 runs.
---
Is there a swing timer I can download for raid bosses? As a holy priest this would be super useful for precasting big heals. Idk if this is even possible and I literally just thought of this, but would be awesome.
---
Dont forget elemental flux 450g
---
Hard disagree.
---
Just offer the healer blues to sell or DE.ill gladly heal a warr who wants a quick arena farm if I make some gold for my Time
---
Right, "be" to me (in the context) implies a universal sense. "Is" implies a direct immediate sense, but does leave open the option for an "isn't".
---
For this reason I've been taking a pretty spartan approach to addons with both Classic and BfA for a while now. I run a mostly-stock UI with a handful of enhancements. It won't win any awards in a competition but it's quite functional.
---
&gt; stalagg will probably become very easy to rank on due to their actions.
---
For the average player sure maybe they'll end up in higher brackets. But the point of high rankers moving is that Stalagg literally has 4-5 Bracket 1 slots while other servers have double that.
---
I'd wager that streamers are like 1% of the people using the bug.
---
You call the default UI minimalist?
---
On Fairbanks, 10 hours a day 6-7 days a week might get you bracket 10
---
I think you have a TSM error
---
How do you know he is afk?  He could have just finished telling someone how many runs it took to get SGC and HOJ when you logged in.
---
This is either a troll post or you're complete shit.
---
it is unreasonable to have high standards when you are a fat slob, sorry. 
---
you can be unreasonable and still get what you want but lets not kid ourselves
---
have more info/math behind stacking/bracket breaking?
---
So the person buying the account gets fucked, I don't really see that as a problem either.
---
There's been a fair amount on sulfuras for months now.  Just go anywhere with dragonkin, and you'll see hunters there 24/7.
---
T2 legs are the easiest thing about Rag loot. Stuff like choker of the fire Lord, band of accuria, that's the good stuff you keep farming for.
---
This is true, I gave up on mine...
---
You‚Äôve revealed your ignorance of mage farming techniques.  Force of Will is a legitimate mage farming item and this warrior claimed it for himself as a tanking item.   
---
Nobody in the group said anything until the warrior started gatekeeping an item he already won.  
---
Then, in typical drama queen warrior fashion, he had to come on the forums so he could get a nice ego stroke about the mean mage and warrior he had to deal with
---
No. I call my customization minimalist. Ideally I'd have both, but unfortunately the default wastes a lot of screen space.
---
there are 2 approaches that've worked well for me!
---
1. find lowbies from lfg, reserve sgc, you'll have time to do angerforge and golem lord (healers love this for second wind trinket) and still hit reset cap per hour
---
2. find 1 or 2 geared friend that you can duo/trio with, reserve, but let them take all other drops for shards/vendor
---
My old Raid Leader &amp; Guild Master had their mythic progression on their Tinder profiles.
---
False, you do not dictate what the 'purpose' of classic wow is.
---
Its easy duo even with un orthodox setup like shaman mage. 
---
Most hard part it's bats with silence spell.
---
If you have other things to farm for, you can farm those too. SGC is insanely good though and you should try to get it. 
---
Personally, I got into the habit of doing 10 Arena runs per day, it helps break up the monotony and you eventually will get it.
---
it means the mats you farm are also cheaper.
---
Not how coding works. Plenty of things outside your control as an individual. All it takes is one minor slip and something gets enabled that shouldn't. Might be intentional anyways.
---
&gt; black Americans are at the forefront of art and culture
---
I've never heard this before either, lol. Art and culture is dominated by white people. Hence white privilege, etc...
---
What's with people starting sentences with 'i mean'? Do you usually say things you don't mean? Sounds so dumb.
---
What point? Runecloth ones cheaper than av rep bandages.
---
This is a really great answer, and I just want to add that they're a deceptively high skill cap class.  A lot of people dismiss them, because there's a lot of bad hunters.  The really good ones though stand out, and are far more useful in both pve and pvp.  
---
My first 60 was a hunter.  I rerolled resto shaman to easier find group invites in vanilla, and have been a shaman main ever since; but I still miss my hunter.  
---
1 more thing.  They're a great farming class.  Both with instanced content like DM solo tribute runs, and in the world having your pet tank enemies while you pick herbs/minerals.
---
drunkenly farmed 100g while binging mandalorian
---
Really? Why is that?
---
You could have at least said you were 130 years old to be believable with your username.
---
My understanding is there's a really great crossbow in BWL that will increase your damage more than any of the armor pieces, and last a very long time.  So it really benefits you now to farm out tier 1, and maybe save up some dkp if you're in a guild that uses it.
---
Runecloth isn't cheaper (40cloth ~2.5-3g vs 20bandages for 80s) and av ones stack to 100.
---
Sadly no but he's ended up in a really good up and comeing guild and made core raiding team I think.
---
First boss in AQ40
---
I said at like, I‚Äôm ahead of server time an hour so that makes sense
---
no. you just use gfpp. melee using fr is dumb.
---
I mention WoW in my Scruff profile (its just in a list of interests). It starts a lot of conversations. I say go for it; you prob want a lady who is chill with your gaming lifestyle anyways
---
&gt; Blizz could easily and cheaply take care of all their servers, they just don't.
---
Why would they when so many suckers worship their game?
---
yes, lasts until AQ and each run takes 4 min ish so it's one of the most simple farms in the game, even tho might take hundreds of runs to get it.
---
Are you using Razer Synapse? I was, and that's what was causing it. I uninstalled it and wham. Never happened again.
---
Don't forget the 4 people fishing.
---
Charge 5g per arena run that's what I do and find a warrior within 10 minutes of advertising
---
Weird, I was farming SGC today too. 4 hours in BRD, 4 Gorosh spawns, 4 blues.
---
I look at my server (Bloodsail Buccaneers) and never notice anything wrong with Classic. Even with a Alliance/Horde imbalance (6:4 or 7:3) there‚Äôs still plenty of Horde players to group with.
---
Then I see this subreddit and it looks like Classic is dying. Wtf.
---
Oh boy here we go again.. uh sure thing, bud! War pally is way better!
---
Take the [mod:alt] out of the macro text. You're not pressing alt to hit that hotkey, only shift.
---
/cast [mod:shift] Fireball; Fireball(Rank 1)
---
You can add the (Rank 2) back in if you want. If not, it'll just cast the highest rank of Fireball.
---
We have 4 locks and 6 mages, so pretty even. Also, just talk to people. Raiders tend to be pretty understanding of loot distribution as long as they know what's going on. I also want to emphasize that it's not one huge clump of items that gets round robined. Toep is it's own list. Mageblade is it's own list. Etc. And we decided this as a guild, so everyone was on board with it as it seemed the most fair. As for who actually gets it in the mage/lock/whatever group we have the class leads take into account a bunch of factors like attendance, usage of consumables, enchanted gear, etc. So to reward people who actually put in the work. And i'm not saying this system is perfect and that we don't make mistakes sometimes. But in the end everyone is happy and knows they will get loot, just a matter of time.
---
At least someone in here has some sense. The mc is easy argument will die once these guys are still struggling on early bwl bosses a month after release.
---
Whats the addon for such inventory ?
---
Grobbulus is almost a perfect 50/50 full/high pop server on NA.
---
Money is temporaly, glory is eternal!
---
Surv and BM were both underrated in vanilla, but youre right theyre definitely getting a lot of love this time around. Its great to see not everyone playing MM.
---
You're one who is obtuse and aloof, telling other people the right way to play a game.
---
Absolutely
---
You need 9%.
---
Shamans absolutely suck
---
Roll mage
---
I never said i'm dictating you to do anything. Try some basic reading.
---
i wonder if you have this active at the same time as a shield spell on mage/priest/lock which shield would break first, or if it depends on the order they're activated. if you can protect it with another shield to preserve it longer that's even more OP.
---
Show me where the bad mountain touched you...

less on both sides hmmm
---
Good thing this thread doesn't mention your server!
---
"Fun" is objective, both spam one button (Chain heal and Frostbolt)
---
I'd personally go shaman for the following reasons
---
+Can do multiple roles
---
+They're always in demand
---
+Wipe prevention is sweet
---
+Totems are OP
---
+Windfury procs are always fun
---
+Ghostwolf is awesome
---
Shamans are way more of a group/support class than anything, every group wants a mage but they are literally one of the most played classes, THEY.ARE.EVERYWHERE, like a damn locus swarm
---
But if we're being real, Mage is much better in PVE/PVP and if you have NO interest in healing or being a support DPS (Totem twisting, offhealing, that kinda thing) AT ALL, just go Mage.
---
Ironically, Mage is probably the more versatile class. In PvE you will be healing as a Shaman unless you can get a token Enhance spot. Elemental is a meme spec in raids, sadly. Mage, meanwhile, is one of the more sought after DPS for their AoE and CC. If you enjoy healing, Shaman is a fine choice, but Mage &gt; Shaman for PvE DPS.
---
In PvP both classes perform fairly well. Elemental shaman actually can be a little frightening with double crit 2k Chain Lightnings, but Mage is known as one of the most frustrating classes to deal with. Between their Ice Block(s), Barriers, slows and roots, Mage can win 1v1 against most classes when played well. The difference between a good mage and a shit one is very large (coming from the worst PvP mage you will ever see). You're very sought after for large scale fights as well as your AoE damage is unrivaled. Pick up Goblin Engineering, take some sappers and 4 or 5 mage friends and you can wipe a poorly stacked world boss raid. Personally, this would be a toss up for me. Shaman feels better in BGs but Mages feel better in open world.
---
Another thing to consider: Gold farming. Mage is second to none at this and I personally don't know of a good Shaman gold farm. For this reason I recommend mage unless you want to heal. If you want to heal, Shaman is the better choice because, for the reasons I've already said, Mage is probably the most overrepresented class.
---
lol
---
Questie will be far more helpful. It will show you on your map exactly where all the spawn points are for quest mobs. It will also alert you in the mouseover tool tip if a mob is needed for a quest (or if it drops something for a quest) and how many more you need. You won't need to search for anything quest related ever again.
---
There is definitely some base stun resist, no clue how much though.  Just about an hour ago I resisted an intercept stun from a warrior, as a Tauren.
---
So you need to get a drop like an eye of sulfras and then all the other mats are purchasable?
---
it's designed for ret/holy hybird. Kinda of a battle cleric them. you go in do damage and if things get too hairy for the healer to keep up, you switch to healing (being able to change weapons in combat kinda support this fantasy).
---
Sadly this doesn't translate well into PVE content and such they became full healers wearing cloth.
---
If your DPS is high, so should your threat be since you'll be doing everything in Defensive Stance.
---
DW generates immense rage, use that to spam Sunders, Bloodthirst and Heroic Strike if you really got too much rage.
---
Keep a shield macroed with shield block, because that's the best way to generate Revenge procs at will. Then macro another button to re-equip your DW.
---
Erm there's no base stun resistance for other classes/races, if that's what you mean.
---
Mythic releases, 29th of jan. Race to world first is a big event on twitch and can last up to 2 weeks and it would seem wierd for them to release new content hype in the same twitch category. Classic/retail content releases have been spread out to avoid clashing on each other
---
As someone who has played mage since the original release of vanilla,  I must say that they positively own..
---
That said, there is an abundance of mages because youtube and twitch streamers made them popular. Be prepared to have like 8 other mages in your raid and have to compete with all of them for gear.
---
I'd suggest try both and decide after you play them both which one you want to be your main and which one you want to be your alt. The mage will be capable of big dick dps in raids and can win some 1v2 or 1v3 matchups in pvp if you get good. The shaman will be more highly valued and useful in raids and get gear easier. It's up to you man.
---
Work‚Äôs done
---
Hunter for tribute runs. Nothing will ever beat how much gold that generates.
---
It requires practice. So be ready for a few hours of failing at the start.
---
This is for WSG queues, not sure why its mentioned in this thread
---
Uh huh. Several alliance guilds have already transferred off stalagg, whole guilds do move servers
---
id take it seriously on a resume.
---
It shows that you can understand everybody elses role mostly better than they can.  you can watch people do dumb shit and still encourage them to do better in a positve way.  you can make people feel important and contribute to the team even if most others think what they do is meaningless.  you can steer forty cats towards a common goal, man id hire you.  tinder tho, maybe not
---
they do RFC &gt; WC&gt;RFK&gt;SM im guessing its pretty smooth curve and imo better than ally where you have to walk to SM everytime u want to do it.
---
Around 20 minutes, they sat there the whole game. Don't have the elapsed time anymore but here's the full map to prove it isn't the start of the game. https://imgur.com/s3gyOow
---
Honestly man just quest. By the time you look for groups, go through dungeons, have bad groups where it will take you a very long time to get through, it‚Äôs just easier to quest. 
---
At least until 44 where you can spam ZF to 49
---
This has happened to me a few time when I hearth to IF on Whitemane
---
Probably not. It depends on how casual you are. If you only raid log and aren‚Äôt really high in DPS or involved in the guild too much, people hardly see you on, then it‚Äôs a very slim chance. Thing is you need A LOT of gold to buy mats for legendaries. You have to spend a lot of time farming them. Hand of Rag is like 6k gold in mats. If you‚Äôre casual you aren‚Äôt gonna be able to commit the time necessary
---
360 with rank 3 discount
---
Yes. It‚Äôs  BiS for fury warriors for a long time.

Yeah, streamers are typically momos that hop on bandwagons to get clicks for money.
---
&gt; He actually added that last part about being defensive, wasn't in the initial post (or I possibly didn't scroll down enough, but I'm pretty sure) - not that that changes anything or is a big deal.
---
No, I didn‚Äôt add that. You didn‚Äôt scroll down enough.
---
&gt; He's still stuck on the number of people behind the screen though, regardless of how many characters are on the actual screen. Can -I- "solo" a dungeon? Technically yes, but I'm not "solo"ing it. I'm 5boxing it. 5 characters are in the dungeon, much tougher to clear with than a standard party, and need to re-run it for matching gear(took me 2 dozen SM Cath runs to get 5x Whitemane Chapeaus &amp; 5x Triune Amulets for example) - Just the same as any other player has to get a 5 CHARACTER group together.
---
You‚Äôre one person. You‚Äôre soloing. Because you‚Äôre one person.
---
One person, should have control of one character, in a fucking multiplayer game. It‚Äôs that fucking simple. 
---
&gt; By his logic, does that mean if someone's spouse or even parents + siblings are watching, they're "basically account-sharing" because 2 to 5 people are behind the screen of one character? Lol
---
No. Obviously not. Because that‚Äôs fucking stupid.
---
So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to just turn on layers by mistake.
---
It IS however possible that there was a bug in something they wrote that was deployed and that part of the code base had to be rolled back to a stable version which might have had something to do with the blackout on Christmas Eve and might include some kind of layering.
---
Not sure I‚Äôm not a new player so couldn‚Äôt say. But tons of active guilds that advertise for lowbies.
---
This sounds a lot better than spending time with family tbh.
---
This happens to me all the time when I'm farming the Stargate Command with SG-1
---
Huh, that's kinda neat but also seems really fucking broken.

I hope to achieve the amount of comfiness that man in the background has achieved one day.

Currently I offer all blues and a 100g tip (if it drops) to the Mage and healer that come along and 3man it with me.

Haha, Horde abused their sheer numbers so hard in the world pvp and now when Alliance can profit for once from having lower numbers, you start crying a river able to resupply Durotar with freshwater? I will tell you what Horde was saying to Alliance at that time: git gud. Stop crying. :)

The difference between SGC and Cadaverous chest is about a 1% dps decrease. Instead of doing 680 dps in MC you'll do 674 dps.

Any NPC's in AV cause durability damage the same way as any other mob would in my experience. I usually tank Balinda/Marshalls/Van and take a bit of durability damage, more by dying. Damage from other players do not cause durability damage.

So we do somewhat of a loot council for certain classes...Rogues have a spreadsheet and we're getting geared pretty evenly.. if you have 3/8 armor pieces and all other rogues hav 4/8, you get dibs.. we separate weapons from armor, and newcomers just get a higher number on the spreadsheet so it keeps it pretty fair.. someone who came in 2 weeks ago can only roll once all rogues have their 4piece for example... multiclass gear gets either counciled or rolled on between classes.. works for the most part, specifically for us rogues.

Alliance players prefer honor gains. If the best way to do that is in Warsong Gulch, they'd sure as heck be in Warsong Gulch PVPing it up. As it is, the current meta means that the gains from mostly PVEing in AV outstrip that, so anyone Alliance side that wants to rank up is forced to go do AV.
---
Regardless of your current build/talents, as far as I am aware, you should be using voidwalker to tank for you if you are past level 10. Later on, voidwalker becomes iffy at holding aggro as you get stronger and you can switch to drain tanking when you get succubus in the 20s, here is a guide for that: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view?usp=drivesdk
---
But at the very least you should only be using imp in dungeons, from what I have seen. If you aren't drain tanking, use voidwalker always in the open world.
---
Not a warlock player so somebody correct me if I am wrong.
---
Jesus that is 2000 gold for a warrior who will have it in the 400th run. I have zero problem with anyone charging money, just shocked how much money is that :D

Surprisingly - you probably should. 
---
Here‚Äôs why: https://jezebel.com/why-your-dating-profile-should-emphasize-your-worst-f-5729923
---
Basically - you‚Äôre far more likely to succeed by putting off a *lot* of people than being middle of the road to the same people. You want the people who really like you either way to think they have a good shot (because you have something weird) and actually engage with you. Tattoos are the best reference for this phenomenon.
---
Everyone saw how good frost mages were at some grinding, and a bunch of min max tryhards flooded the arcane Halls with their foolish antics.  Since there are so many mages obsessed with damage now, they tend to pull aggro, and wipe a lot of groups. Mages are the new huntards.
---
Seconded, Earthfury
---
Come to Earthfury :)
---
Hunters are good in both. Your main role raiding isn't to dps but kite/tranq/soak/pull. If you can also pull decent dps that is great.
---
In pvp hunters are awesome and as a priest I hate them.
---
If I'm not mistaken, it's Xperl.
---
It's true tho. Ppl are just straight up lazy af and can't be arsed thinking. Questy turns quests into a chore list. Spy ruins PvP. We sacrifice quality for convenience because ppl want to take short cuts and then still expect the same sense of accomplishment they would have gotten from actually putting in some hard work and problem solving.

you actually spend less time and gold if you are in a guild like this :)

Yes. If you arent 60 yet, farm that shit until it drops. At 60 you and 2 other people can do arena/anger easily. Wont even need 5 people.

\*good warriors

On My warrior I got some wierd luck. Got sgc quite fast, but never seen hoj.
---
I still need bracers, valor shoulders and ember shoulders. But got 2 sets of dalrends. They just drop all the time.
---
ok joey.
---
Leave the pouch
---
Imagine needing a 40 man raid for Molten Core in 2019
---
The shut up and queue pre made discord is great (if you're NA). The application process is easy and the groups usually win. I was like 25-5 in the past few nights with the premades. If you want discord info send me a PM!
---
Due to the ease of arena farm, I‚Äôd give it a go. Fun to get purples hehe
---
How did you word it?
---
Wouldn't surprise me if layers are simply using shard-technology with an additional server restriction.
---
I think it depends on what you want to play. Personally they‚Äôre both awesome in certain roles. Mages do good dps at pretty much all stages of the game and have semi decent raid utility. Shaman are great and coveted pve healers / supports that there are always needs for.
---
As far as PvP goes they‚Äôre both relatively equal in viability tbh. Mages offer great damage and control in PvP. Elemental shaman are also S tier offensive supports in organized PvP that offer incredible burst and great team support. The only reason people might be confused into thinking they‚Äôre lackluster is because they begin to really take off and shine in T2 quality gear. They really become quite oppressive in organized PvP. But so do mages. 
---
If you want great damage and control capabilities roll mage.
---
If you want to be a semi versatile offensive support class than roll shaman.
---
I actually got mine on christmas I swear it works!
---
You don't understand, the que is a bonus. If everybody has a que, sitting in que hurts noone.
---
I get to do shit. Screw playing ally all day and not having any downtime.
---
This shit is wild
---
its almost certainly the same tech repurposed. a shard isn't 'a zone' it has just been restricted to a zone for WoW.
---
Same here. Except I got all other BiS at least two weeks before finally getting my sgc. I guess I‚Äôm happy I never paid anyone for it since my Guildmates were always helping me out.
---
dude paid ~300 bucks for a dick pic.
---
Also every weapon is a hunter weapon

&gt; Every transaction, message, and account activity is logged, its not a secret. The first step is to create automated protocols for flagging gold sellers, who follow blatant patterns, with the occasional adaptation (Blizz's wageslaves probably wouldn't be allowed to adapt until a manager gives the ok, though.) Once the suspicious activity is flagged, a GM goes into the logs, confirms what's up, and then nukes the participants. 
---
Logging and analyzing are two totally different things. Logging things is easy, analyzing these logs with logical, reliable patterns is pretty expensive.

Any way you could hit me with a new link?

Repentence can be taken off by berserker rage btw

not enough money for a 40 man full raid schlong, apparently
---
All the hybrid PvP sets are itemized pretty shitty.
---
hey, in the video description this is the spec you posted: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230054001002--20350230132351301
---
may I ask why 3/3 elemental precision when the mobs are low enough for you to be hit capped already? I assume it could be so that you can use the same spec to do lvl 60 pve, but in that case you would presumably have also gotten 5/5 imp FB, no? 
---
and also why no piercing ice? I get that the +sp coefficient is low for aoe, but I feel like 3/3 piercing ice would be much better than Arcane Meditation (which you also have) and 3/3 elemental precision.
---
I hope this doesn't come across as snarky in any way, your videos have been so very helpful to me - I'm just genuinely curious because I'm still trying to find my holy grail spec for this (I am going to be respeccing 2pts out of improved FB for 2/2 Frost Warding cuz you seem to be taking much less dmg than I when shield is down)
---
This is a troll post, and you all fell for it. Yikes
---
oh man, there are way lunch iddle combat stance without enemy target??
---
I started with 3 Graves until I got the hang of it and could kite them without losing to melee leeway. Once I got the hang of timings, I started opening more Graves. I can do about 8-10 Graves at a time now without any problem. Watch a few YouTube videos to get all the info, just remember to start with less mobs than what they suggest. Also, you should conjor both your mana gems. Use the first one at 80% then the CD will be ready on the second one when you oom. You can also do a mana pot at 80% and you should be able to pot again when oom.
---
Getting to 60 and raiding/pvping with my friends.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure mines don‚Äôt affect honor in classic. I capped both mines and it didn‚Äôt seem to give anything at game end.
---
Art
---
Well the runs itself take like 5 minutes but you can only enter 5 instances an hour.
---
So technically 60 hours but in practice maybe 30.
---
Erm if your insta-queues have that many AFKs... You should check out Horde.
---
Wing commanders pause in location when the game ends and will not continue their route home. Source: me and Jeztor standing 5 feet from their return spot, and Jeztor just stops completely.
---
It's basically just 100% mount, which makes sense because 60% mount makes you effectively useless at this point.
---
They also ask for pre-raid BIS, but I just mentioned my retail arena experience and was approved without delay even though they didn't ask for any proof. So if you suck, you can probably lie your way into it too.
---
How about an add-on in-game that is in sync with the web? To handle invites and so on.
---
Pretty cool idea
---
Oh good to know, thx!
---
Mind linking me where I said I use 6/8 t1? Because I never once said that. Your entire argument is based off of bullshit lol.
---
Doing the initial quests is good XP, plus you get the blue weapon and the trinket. After that, I agree, XP isn't really worth it.
---
Are you playing om NA? Horde wins 95% of the time if Alliance Arent a premades.
---
198 honor and 12 AV rep per bunker that dies.
---
I'll ask our add-on-makers about such opportunity
---
Hate being this guy, but I had to know - 375$ if it was monthly subs. 25 toons in total.
---
Let's you set a waypoint and shows a big arrow pointing towards it. You can click quests in Questie too navigate to them with TomTom
---
Damn, thanks for that!
---
It's not like it's also pre Raid BiS for Hunters or something :)
---
Reading comprehension not your strong point? I'm saying skeram is in the same situation as stalagg and nobody will consider going there.
---
Found these guys recently and found them so hilarious I had to share.
---
I did it 2 man with a 55 priest when it dropped.
---
Oh nice, I‚Äôll try using her more then
---
What a great addon, thank you for the answer!
---
lol, raise
---
Not visually impaired, just lazy. When I get back to playing again I'm sure to check this one out. Thanks!
---
Insert gif - that's a penis!
---
Poor alliance, I hope blizzard will give you extra honor to compensate for this horrendous experience.
---
 The quest item, Umi's mechanical yeti can only be used when near her friend's: 
---
Legacki in Everlook (Winterspring)
---
Sprinkle in Gadgetzan (Tanaris)
---
Quixxil in Marshal's Refuge (Un'Goro Crater)
---
and has a 30 second cooldown...
---
Is this a troll post? You can get hypnotic blade (+9 SP) and Celestial Orb (+13 frost SP) at the same level with 4 SP difference. 
---
I get you love the staff but it's nowhere near objectively better than mageblade given madeblade is +14 SP more before even considering an offhand..
---
Please just delete that char and choose a different name. It's potentially the least creative name you could use...
---
This is clear hard evidence that there is layering going on some places.
---
Felwood/Ungoro fire elementals is around 70-80g/h on my server if uncontested. This obviously doesn't work on higher pop.
---
Ive done premades with 3 healers, ofc it's not the 2 mega public discord premades tho
---
hi, if you want to edit a video in an easy way. You can try BeeCut. This multi-functional tool has  a user-friendly interface. try it now. BeeCut-edit-a-video.html
---
Like 80% of onyxias damage is fire. Her auto attacks are Meh, but her fire breath does a fucking lot. She'll crit for like 1800 with autos, if you get crit twice and then breathed you die. Unless you resist 75% of the damage. I tank her with around 220fr and it's a breeze.
---
ah ok.
---
and with the whole #nochanges, I don't think there's going to be a solution that they can/will implement.
---
it'd be nice if horde could also queue and play as the other faction
---
It only had 7 Stam and *Ranged* attack power, so you should only ever be competing with other hunters for it.
---
Pathetic all that gear and no chest. Some guildy spend hours farming that chest and look at you with disgust.
---
Okay, so essentially every instant of a WoW Client just gets the same inputs the player makes. That sounds legit.
---
Plus they usually have zero insight. It's a black box. I don't know why warrior A got 2 items that run, while warrior B got 0.
---
My guild maintains a log of what items people got when, and you can usually guess who is going to get the next one, but still.
---
Other guilds use a public prepared excel sheet which shows who is getting the next item. Seems the most fair to me.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt play a shaman if all you think we do is spam Chain heals. Totems which can vary by fight, and shamans will be twisting in later content. We still have the oh shit Nature Swiftness+Healing Wave. We have to manage our mana a lot more carefully vs a mage having 2 mana pots + Evocation. And out Tier pieces effect how we heal. 
---
Shaman. Unless you want to spam Frostbolt in raid then roll shaman.
---
Thats weird, I always see them get filled up eventually before the gates open.. I must have bad luck, gimme those free wins lol.
---
Dunno if you've ever read TOS/EULA on modern games, but basically you have absolutely no ground to stand on. No one wants to ban customers who don't deserve it, but most botters and gold sellers are very easy to pick out, anyway.
---
Wrong subreddit?
---
If you are an ally hunter I think the OFH would be better because you would get more of a boost from kings?
---
I love hunter, but there is so many flaws, bugs, and poor design choices to say it's the best designed.
---
Blasphemy!
---
wasn't hard for a hobbyist on LH. Maybe a small indie company like Blizz just doesn't have the know how of WhiteKidney from Light's Hope or a various Russians making money off their servers.
---
I'm on my third character, going to 60 and I feel like it's.
---
Spellcleave - &gt; Grinding mobs mixed with selected quests - &gt; Regular questing mixed with dungeons -&gt; Regular dungeon farming.
---
But most importantly, do what you feel like, just mix it up. 
---
The issue with dungeons is that it can take a long time getting there, and waiting for others, and you may get really bored of them eventually. The issue with regular questing is again, that some quests have you waste too much time traveling, and that there's simply not enough of them.
---
What people underestimate with regular grinding is that there's no travel time, so the longer you grind, them more time you save. And you make a lot of gold in doing such, especially if you target the right mobs/areas with nodes.

Both Fiery wep and lifestealing enchants process with Ravager.

Hello! Can cloth or leather toons wear mail? How? Thanks!
---
can get a further 15% with a 10points in prot tree
---
Yeah i too enjoy watching premade alliance groups lose to non premade horde XD

Do you ever play for fun? (a rhetorical question)
---
No you

I think cause y‚Äôall are drowned with horrible attitudes and have to look at the same post 10 times a day.  
---
Going into the pub av with the wrong mindset to begin with.
---
The top tier ally players are equally as good as the top tier horde players.
---
The 2nd tier ally players are as good as maybe the 3rd or 4th tier horde players
---
and the rest of the ally players are an utter dumpster fire.
---
But remember horde are screwed because if queue times.
---
85% of statistics are made up on the spot.
---
Sure, but the same hunters would be there 24/7.  According to wowhead the sinew only drops in Winterspring and Azuregos which wasn't released yet, and hunters were camped in other zones as well.
---
There's always bad premades on either faction, joining a random group of people who call themselves a premade but dont VOIP, don't make proper calls, etc is practically no different than joining a random BG.
---
Finding a place in the good ones is what matters.
---
I agree,  this is art.
---
I have seen quite a few mages too. They spam fireball and drink between each mob.
---
Amazed to be honest.
---
I think you can learn it from your class trainer
---
This is exactly what we do, I asked every Priest to send me a wish list of loot from MC / Ony compiled it into a spreadsheet and it makes life super easy for our ML.
---
0 drama and everyone knows what's going on at all times, plus keeps people showing up for raids since they know what there getting.
---
twitter isnt real life my man
---
You just proved that you have no idea what you are talking about. I'm not big data scientist myself but work pretty close with them and I know how costly it is. You just go by your feeling from playing on a private server.
---
Sorry it was originally in because I was unsure if I wanred to use alt or shift. I decided on shift
---
Get a vending machine... i mean mage. Questing till you hit sm then join up and grind sm into zf into brd is probably the best. It wont be the fastest, but will allow for good speed while knocking out some pre bis gear.
---
How do you get TomTom to work with questie ?
---
Warriors only destroy bad hunters. Intercept only has 25y range. Any good hunter can kill a warrior from 40y without ever getting into intercept range.
---
You're 100% correct but people don't seem to know. I feel like they never tried changing zone with people around them.
---
I'm curious, how's your pre-planned list is created? Is it random or based on a certain set of criteria? Do you adjust the list over time, or is it set in stone? 
---
Say you have 6-8 mages, everyone wants a mageblade. Being placed in the end of that queue for that particular item must be quite demotivating. You're basically being told up-front that you have no chance of getting your BIS item for several months to come. And what happens if say staff of dominance drops? Do you just give it to mage/lock that was on top of mageblade list and they move to the end of the queue, or they can pass on it and keep their position on top of the list?
---
You can start the quest with just one Binding, just chat the guy up and click through the dialogue. At the end you‚Äôll receive a quest item that starts the Questline. Source: I have one binding and got the quest in my log that requires me to have both bindings, 10 Elementium Bars (for which we have to wait for BWL) and the Essence of the Firelord (dropped by Ragnaros 100% when you have this quest).
---
I upvoted,  i ain't a part of your system.
---
I don't think anything will be changed. It is sadly exactly as it was in 1.12.1 and not a bug. They should just not have gone with cross-realm battlegrounds nor 1.12 Alterac Valley. Now that it is done I don't see them going backwards. It would be odd and unprecedented.
---
Introducing any sort of retail-like debiff would be even worse.
---
It is exactly the same kind of issue as WPvP. Old setup on modern mindset.
---
True winner is the guy who gets most honor while afking!
---
&gt;Look at any of the videos people are presenting on reddit, its blatant.
---
Yeah, it seems to be obvious for the human eye after direct interaction with a bot.   
---
&gt; Sorry officer, I left my bot spotting credentials at home, I swear I've been to no private servers, too. Can I get off with a warning? 
---
That's what I thought.
---
Yes. That‚Äôs what I meant. My bad haha.
---
Absolute numbers don't mean much with sims, especially if you don't know debuffs, buffs, and fight length used for it.
---
Got hoj and sgc in less than 10 runs total.
---
People need content, if they don't speed things up they will loose to many players. Remember this is content most people have done before.
---
This. I think Horde is having a harder time. They are probably getting stomped 50-70% of the time by a premade.
---
I wonder, does US/EU/RU just care more about layers, while the Korean/Chinese players never complained?
---
And to make it even shorter: remove the spaces in the parts that are in between brackets and change "noharm" to "help" (technically not the same, but in most situations the same result). [@mouseover,help,nodead].
---
u/SqueeshyRogue
---
If the mobs are heavy hitters (I'm thinking of SM monks) consider Barkskin as well.
---
Not really worth it on normal pulls though.
---
Doesn't do anything I'm pretty certain. We've been capping mines for some time, the honor gains are the same with or without them.
---
This is a great tip, thanks!
---
so it was a crowdfunded dick pic
---
How are you simming?
---
Imagine being in a guild that are total metaslaves to what class gets what items.
---
Cat doesn‚Äôt bring anything to a raid other than their dps coefficient, which it shares with several beasts. At least bring a wolf and be useful to your team, adding dps to everyone in the group.
---
Imo it‚Äôs faster than mage groups because you don‚Äôt have to drink
---
Having the right weapon with op enchants is fun. Back in BC I leveled a Druid tank and at lvl 45 I had all bis gear wardens staff with agility. It‚Äôs fun to beast mode the lower levels. Not efficient but you know what you can rush to 60 and be bored or you can accomplish your personal dreams and have fun.
---
Yeah as a hunter myself. If we can hang back and not actually get targeted then we do well.  God help you if you get into a 1v1 situation against pretty much anyone
---
I'll keep an eye out for that staff, thanks! But yeah, one of the hunters was the main culprit for sidepulling, too over-zealous with the multi-shot...
---
Thats why playing alliance is cool. You are always the underdog
---
Oh and another great tip all tho its pretty self explanatory, mark your main target with a skull, so that the trigger happy lock and mage can focus the target you are focusing on, and if they then decide to go full out on an unmarked mob, let them die and they will quickly learn
---
Bestes Leben zum heilen
---
I‚Äôve been queuing non stop and have inly encountered a couple premades. My win rate is more around 90%. The funny thing is, even one of the premades lost lol. it‚Äôs a lost cause on the ally side.
---
It's not doable right now.  I've seen a vid where a guy pulls the entire cath by attacking the boss, frost novaing, flamestriking, etc, but it's not possible with current gear.  You said it yourself - they resist.  If they resist, you're dead.
---
It‚Äôs actually possible.  Some of the mages in my server that charge for cath runs can do this.
---
And then there‚Äôs this video:
---
https://youtu.be/OkoyRPCIkdQ
---
It‚Äôs from just a month ago and from the comments section, it looks like he is playing on classic servers
---
That's actually a helpful tip about the &lt;25% mobs, I usually stick on them until they're dead, but it would help build threat on the next target sooner to switch then. Thanks!
---
The numbers stated earlier also dont take into account, you're spec/build, proc crits(if applicable), and the range of dmg from procs. Ive had the doomsaw proc crit for over 800. If you are a slam 2h fury spec for ex you might get more use from the chance on hit items than you would in lets say arms
---
How so? My bank and bags have never been more organised

No...
---
I don‚Äôt see the advantage of going full BM over 20/31/0. Your pet gains trueshot aura will in a party so would your party members.
---
Are your friends melee players? I would suggest shaman. It's pretty reactive, rather than having to anticipate things as Druid. And your friends will be super happy with windfury totem if they play melee classes. Furthermore, it's just a super fun class to play. Try it out!
---
We have a bear tank in my guild - wonderful tank, easy to heal and the mobs stick to him like glue. He's been raiding for a while and probably has a lot more gear than you, I just wanted to let you know that it's possible to be a great tank as a druid. He does the regrowth/rejuv thing any time he doesn't have rage he needs to preserve, as far as I can tell.
---
Invis pots are handy.
---
I'll definitely have a chat with the dps next time, I was mostly losing mobs to multi-shot -.- Thank you for the write-up, it's very helpful!
---
Can anyone recommend any sole priest farms for Maraudon, please?
---
Seems like a weak argument imho. 
---
AoE farming was never really limited by how fast you could pick up loot so that argument just doesn't make sense. 
---
There are many QoL changes that I'd agree break immersion. Individually clicking on each body and waiting half a second to auto loot is not one of them.
---
Yeah how dare people complain about a clearly broken system
---
There are no AV Horde premades tho... Still on a 25 game winstreak
---
Don't call me Altogether.
---
Any reason in particular on why you are doing SM pulls? You goin for gold farms? Were you boosting someone?
---
It's not, he is delusional. Ogre forged is better on alliance, same on horde.
---
Thats what I said
---
It's good to know it's possible, I just need more practice haha
---
I gave up after 750 runs, never seen it once. Now trying to get rank 8 for pvp chest, which is ok.
---
No but that's an interesting take. In truth stats have value and that value can be quantified. If we lived in a world without math you'd have a point I suppose.
---
This is my first time on alliance, only played horde on pservers and my experience is being miserable so far, pug x pug on wsg is pretty much 1v19, it's kinda weird because I don't remember ally being this shit on the servers I've played, maybe because all the tryhard EU guilds always went alliance to even out the dumpster fire the default alliance player is.
---
Farms as in plural? There's only one way to do it really. You just go and kill 2-3 bosses and loot herbs/nodes along the way depending on your professions. It's really easy to do as shadow spec, holy can do it too but it takes longer.
---
This is bullshit. I've main tanked both MC and Onyxia and it's even preferable due to the immense threat Manual Crowd Pummeler brings.
---
Don't listen to this guy /u/Solell
---
It's a super effing rough grind, but it's best in slot until AQ40. No clue when Blizzard releases AQ40 but it's not unlikely that they release it 8-12 months from now.
---
Assuming AQ isn't released sooner, that's 32-48 weeks of raiding with SGC before you even have the opportunity to replace it with something better. Knowing the scarcity of loot in 40 man raids it'll take even longer before you upgrade it.
---
Take that knowledge and weigh it against the misery of farming BRD arenas hundreds of times.
---
Can u give me some please i need lionheart. Incendius ally war
---
That one's very nice too, and easier to get. I'll definitely be aiming for that, and maybe eventually I'll be lucky/rich enough for the warden staff haha
---
Hey dude, thank you so much for this one! Doesn‚Äôt Shaman also get the ghost wolf? I love me some increased movement speed!
---
I really appreciate your feedback; I‚Äôll start 2020 as a shaman and play my part as a support! Much love dude, all the best for 2020 :) üéÑ

&gt;\#showtooltip Swipe  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/startattack  
---
&gt;/cast Swipe
---
* This /Macro as your 'Swipe' works great tanking mulitple mobs, since with just 'Swipe' it stops attacking after 1 mob dies.
---
* Keybind the raidmarks (keybind&gt;targetmarkers) and bind atleast skull and cross. This way your party focusses the same units and u can taunt that target
---
* Fieryfire, Demo roar and maul are your best threat generators. Have them up. Swap targets with maul and use swipe as filler (but you'll get a feel for this the more you play!)
---
* U got the correct talents? Its easier with 'Omen of Clarity'+full feral instead of 0/30/21 or something (also very good build), Omen of Clarity gives free swipes and alot of aggro!
---
\- Do you mean X or Y?  
---
\-Yes, that's what i meant.  
---
haha
---
Issue is you are wasting your time but not the bot owners time. You would also need to form an alliance with a cross fraction guild which also hunts bot.
---
I've heard about Manual Crowd Pummeler. Do you only use it on bosses or on tough packs as well?
---
True, that's why it is easier to run point based system, if point aqusition is fair and all exceptions, that LC has the right to influence are stated before person joins raid. EP/GP uses coded text to export data to a Web page, that is transparent to everyone to browse.
---
There are downsides. Point volume decay must be presented (-15%...-25% per week) to prevent point hoarding, passing on stuff that gives em upgrade in favor of BIS or act as if they receive salary (points only determine your position in queue on receiving next item, if it drops).
---
Main question is... how did you get up there?
---
You can't queue bug AV because the bug abuses party queue, while AV is solo only.
---
It's possible that a premade is trying to get in, but horde premades are far between (at least in most regions) and it takes more than one premade trying to queue for the same game to hold it for more than two minutes.
---
pic or did mit happen...
---
Can you let me know how/what you used to sim it please?  Keen to try out some ideas
---
Yeah my comment wasn't entirely AV related, i was talking about PvP as a whole. 
---
You'll likely find what i said is true for your horde WSG/AB premades, for every good one on your server theres 50+ groups of randomers who'll advertise as a premade to queue as a 10 then act like it's a random BG and lose you 90% of your games with them.
---
They can try sure, but there's basically no way you can single queue to fill the gaps. I can imagine a big discord with a hundred or so players might be able to get enough people into every game, I think Russians do that (they definitely have horde premades going), idk about other regions.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZGBQ8Uh.png
---
That would only hold the spots for 90 seconds or whatever the queue timer is, not even enough for the gates to open. You'd need a second or even third premade trying to get into the same game.
---
You are literally describing changing layers. They're shouldn't be layers, regardless of who phases to where.
---
So you have keys in your keyring? If not your keyring will just look like empty slots at the bottom of your bag.
---
Only bosses! And it's not always necessary either. It's mostly for Ragnaros and Onyxia.
---
As for the question in your post, you might be taking too much damage due to:
---
1) Your gear being out of date
---
2) Your healer being undergeared
---
3) You're pulling too much at once while one or both of the above apply
---
The bots will still fuck with the economy even if you put WoW tokens in classic. Every MMO on the market has a botting problem, regardless of wither or not they offer ways to buy in game money. Adding official ways to buy currency won't eliminate the RMT sites, since they'll just start undercutting the official methods and still turn a profit. If anything the botters would just double down to compensate for any lost profits from undercutting.
---
I'll definitely give that macro a try. For demo roar, do you cast it more than once, or does it generate a good amount of threat just from the one cast? I usually have it up but I only do it the once for the debuff
---
As for talents, I'm working towards omen of clarity, but I'm only level 56 atm. It'll be the last talent I get
---
but how do you manage distribution in the first place? 5 priests wanting the eye on the first drop. Just roll? Give it to a priest directly on what sense of priority?
---
Got tf on my alt, there are 3 legendaries in vanilla, you get 2 of em in mc.
---
Just lead a pug and reserve the legendaries.
---
Easy peasy
---
The "mega discord premade" takes games no matter the ratio, but I can tell you that 3 healer games really suck if horde decides to defend.
---
Thanks
---
Seems like I‚Äôll be sticking to pulling smaller packs until I‚Äôm a bit more geared
---
To summarise key points:
---
1. This is Classic, not retail.  Don't stress if you don't have aggro on all mobs 100% of the time. Ensure you have aggro on any specific hard-hitting mobs and that you are keeping aggro off the healer.
---
2.  The problem is mainly a dps one.  In Classic, no tank can keep aggro on 3 targets that are each being full nukes by a separate dps.  If they get aggro, it's their own fault.
---
3. To help with this, mark targets - skull for first kill, cross for second kill, square and moon for cc.  I have these 4 markers keybound.
---
4. In addition to this, if you can encourage dps to wait 5 secs after you pull, this gives you the chance to get aggro on all targets (which means they start hitting you, which means you get lots of rage, which makes keeping aggro easier). But good luck with this in a pug!
---
5. The best way to deal with a large group is to make it a small group! Use cc and it can often be the best approach to tell dps to focus small adds first (boss and 4 little adds running around causing trouble is a dangerous situation; boss on his own, clearly controlled by tank, is a safe kill).
---
These are all general tanking tips.
---
For bear-specific:
---
6. Use FFF on cd. Unless you need the gcd, it's free threat.
---
7. Use Maul rather than Swipe. Only use Swipe to dump rage.
---
8. Make sure you use Growl BEFORE any threat generating abilities (growl, maul, fff, maul is good; maul, fff, growl, maul is bad).
---
9. Pre-hot. Along with Enrage, this helps a lot with the initial pull. But... takes time and is either not really necessary (a waste of time) or the dps will have pulled by then anyway!  Definitely use for occasional tricky pulls though.
---
Good luck!
---
LMAO
---
Making my first alt now, are there any guides for grinding with selected quests? I‚Äôm sort of just questing here and there with the occasional dungeon group and it‚Äôs slow.
---
This is definitely not the normal experience in major regions, because the queue pop expires before the gates open. You'd need more than one premade getting the same game one after another for this to happen.
---
So why were there post before about it scaling from mid 2000's?
---
I quit today. 
---
I was alliance. 
---
I have a wife and baby now. I won't commit the time I did in classic. Left game today.
---
you mean the people who mass fled pvp servers because of pvp actually suck at pvp?
---
\*surprised pikachu\*
---
See ya.
---
Current AV meta is destroying the ranking system, I really hope they do something about it before it's too late.
---
It might have scaled before 1.12 possibly. But the reference client Blizzard uses is 1.12, so in that specific patch it didn't scale.
---
Badlands is amazing,  the elementals are great for making gold
---
If its anything like try hards on pservers, Ally premades are the ones that rolfstomp horde premades. Support pallies are that good.
---
This thing is a pile of shit dude. 30 minute cooldown for 500 damage? Get the arena trinket.
---
The Kirby main
---
Run in, as far as you can. 
---
Fight for your life. 
---
If you die corpserun back into cave.
---
Kill 2-3 mobs
---
Get flag
---
Profit
---
The correct way is to respect Elemental, melt things faster, drink up every 3 mobs. Overall quicker.
---
Cya later!
---
That's why you don't let them, if you do then wing clip/scatter/fd frost, get out again.
---
Also, bombs, nades, intimidation. Lots of ways to get out of melee range
---
Actually it's closer to 70%
---
Blizz : "we limited the number of skeletons because people could use them to spell out advertisements"
---
Shaman multiboxers : "hold my totem"
---
I dont't even consider banthok sash worth to farm, any drop from arena is extremely infuriating to get
---
I think HoJ has actually a better drop rate than any item from any arena boss because you never seem to get the one you need
---
I hope that pregnant man is ok
---
That's a neat trick:)
---
Growl puts you at the top of the threat table and gives you aggro.
---
So if you don't have aggro on a mob, the threat from any abilities cast pre-growl will be wasted (you will still end up at the top of the threat table, whether you cast 3 Mauls before Growl or not).
---
But Mauls cast after Growl will increase your lead at the top of the threat table.
---
Pre-mades never defends because its faster to lose the game after you have killed all the commanders and lieutenants.
---
I heard there‚Äôs a cure for normies.
---
I love how angry allies are basically saying that since phase 2 was hell for them then this should be hell for horde. It's not the players' fault the factions are so unbalanced and these are both problems that stem from that inbalance. Making the game more enjoyable for both alliance and horde is doable by Blizzard but these people are taking role playing and hating horde seriously enough to not want the game to be fixed out of pure spite. I'm on the same boat, I'll probably be done with the game if nothing comes out to fix it. It's a shame so many people feel like a majority of players waiting 20+ minutes to play 15 minute games isn't a problem that needs fixing.
---
It was quite a huge debate on Chinese fan sites whether there should be layers, as it's not that #nochange.
---
And when honor system came online, you could escape corpse camp by switching layers,but you also can't  nailed down death squad as they can escape to other layer if they get outnumbered. I don't see much server lagging like a lot posts on reddit are talking about when P2 released.
---
Then when BG comes, people seems forget about layers. Anyway, overall I think layers are quite helpful, there are sufficient resources for the realm, and kind friendly for leveling the alts.
---
I havent even seen a PvPing player in days. World PvP is beyond dead now
---
First boss drop, just need to coordinate 3 tanks and 6 interrupts and that fight is on farm status.
---
Stun resistance stacks additively which means you've got:
---
* 5% base chance to resist stuns
---
* 25% chance to resist stuns from the passive racial ability hardiness
---
* 15% chance to resist if a warrior is specced iron will in prot tree
---
Most orcs will have a 30% chance to resist stuns and a small subset of orc warriors will have a 45% chance to resist stuns since most players PVP as 31/20/0.
---
Erhm? Wilful denial over here. That would be layering then dude.
---
U are right but u have to be so prepared as a hunter compared to another class that‚Äôs my point
---
I Can second this tip.
---
Also i sometimes shape shift and Use war stomp if the runners are low HP and some AoE is firing.
---
But yeah, pre-hot and use demo shout + maul/swipe.
---
Casters i normally dont Care about since they stand their place (if AoE tanking)
---
Farm for later phases since we will really fucking need it.
---
We're talking DPS not PvP.
---
Greetings, fellow BF player.
---
Unfortunately the queue times are not likely to improve, so I'd recommend queueing and flying to Azshara, Felwood or Winterspring to chip away at some quest or just grind mobs/farm for the 15ish minutes. Either that, or get a wireless headset and clean/food prep/workout while waiting for the queue to pop.
---
And once you do get in, do your best to push objectives, defend your base and win - fast losses are NOT worth anything with these queue times, at least not in the reputation department.
---
Wow this is a fantastic idea. Well done on following through with it.
---
As a quick tip, mark targets, cast rejuv and regrowth, before faerie fire and charge. Queue a maul on skull while charging, demo shout and swipe (on more than 2 targets) while getting mobs in position. Then another maul on skull. At that point try to cycle through enemies and toss mauls on them if aoe is being used, if not swipe is enough to keep them off people. Demo only needs to be used once.
---
Blizzard doing blizzard shit could indeed be it. What is this you‚Äôre doing then? Fanboi doing fanboi shit? Why defend incompetence?
---
There are tons of guides out there, but nothing that stands out. I haven't found one that says which quests are good vs not, and a lot of guides are also outdated or copies of each other with minor changes. 
---
It's more about using common sense, and picking up a bunch of quests when your new to a zone, and focus on grinding, while headed towards an area that has mobs u need to kill/collect loot from. 
---
Think of questing as a minor bonus to your grind, not the other way around. If they ask you to go speak to some1 in another zone etc. just skip it, or save it until u travel there.
---
An example would be, The Nesingwary hunter quests in STV, these are great depending on the time of the day and week, you get to grind animals, but also complete 6 quests while doing so (also get the 15 ear scalp quest from booty bay).  
---
Some quests can be fun also, so it can be worth doing them for variation.
---
Because alliance players are larpers who like the appeal of "comfy cities" and cute outfits and reading the quests, whereas horde players are actual pvpers who chose horde specifically because they have better racials.
---
I am waiting to hit 40 as well. I drink every few mobs and I am restoration. Find a mage and get a couple stacks of water.
---
Goes for less than 200g on gehennas horde
---
No it's not... Sometimes different zones, have different severs, even if there is only one layer. Or it's just a delay if you are switching zones. That's was pretty common in classic. It's just like  loading a new area
---
Key bindings should be synced as far as I know.
---
Got add-ons you copy the interface&gt;add-on folder over.
---
a premade won't save you, if the opposing team are of a mind to the can just turtle and push you back to your base...even though it dose take a while.
---
And no - I wouldn't use it on pull.
---
My standard opener is (for up to 4 targets):
---
Get square and moon cc'd
---
FFF to pull skull
---
Maul skull
---
Demoralising Roar
---
Switch to cross
---
Maul cross
---
FFF cross
---
*
---
Back to skull
---
Maul / auto until at 25% health
---
Switch to Cross
---
Maul / auto until at 25% health 
---
Switch to moon
---
Remark moon as skull
---
Maul / FFF moon/skull
---
With more than 4 targets (or limited cc) it gets more complicated.  Start the same, but at *, you need to start tab-targetting round any loose mobs.  Maul, FFF and a couple of auto attacks on each target, then switch.
---
Probably not anymore unless you have a good healer friend who will consistently duo with you, if you didn't get it in the time you farmed hoj your time is probably better spent trying to get rank 10 but it's more whether you're willing to go for it or not, its a grind some people hate a lot more than others because after you hit that instance cap you need to find something else to do for 40 minutes, I just leveled an alt during downtime and it wasn't so bad
---
I wouldn't consider either grind though if you have anything easier you can still replace though
---
PVE - hunters currently do competitive damage (not anywhere near bis geared &amp; world buffed warriors, but certainly enough for your average casual guild), but their damage barely scales throughout the phases, so by Naxx your DPS will be pretty much irrelevant. A couple hunters are still used for trueshot aura and tranq shot, sometimes for kiting duties. Some guilds make their hunters go melee to apply Nightfall debuff, but that's a very sad way to play the game and is not very common.
---
PVP - hunters are the anti mage class. In a proper 1v1 a mage can easily win if they get a nova off, but in battlegrounds you're going to have much more opportunities to burst them down. Hunters also excel at area denial through frost trap and flares.
---
best answer so far, however I find the trinket rather useless. The Timbermaw Ancester should actually be able to cast up to 6 times after spawned, but due to just running around he mostly does 2-3 castst. Also I tested the "receive dmg" part and he just stood there and looked at me while mobs did beat me up xD .. not sure what is wrong with the guy but yestday he healed me for around 1200 (3x 400) which was quite nice
---
Its not that bad -took me 85 runs, most people get it in a few dozen runs. Its totally worth it and i suggest you grind for it. 
---
Keep in mind all those redditards claiming they did 200,500,1000 runs etc are just crying and lying children. I have farmed about 13000 gold since reaching lvl 60 on my warrior, im a notorious grinder, and trust me, there is no way anyone did 200+ Brd arena/anger runs for hoj or chain. Its mentally not possible unless you are being paid wage to do it, yet every thread there are multiple reditards claiming they did hundreds or even a thousand runs.  
---
As i said, its worth it and not that bad of a grind, good lick.
---
Alliance side is 1.5 mil
---
SGC is 14 agi 13 str and 2 crit. stat weights give it a score of about 102
---
BDS chest w/ 3pc is 50 ap 2% crit or 104 stat score
---
they're comparable at least and bds doesnt require 200+ run rng.  that time could be better spent finishing don julio's ring rep and working towards beserker's bracers rep.
---
also obsidian mail tunic comes out before naxx. maybe you should stop spreading nonsense yourself.
---
It doesn't matter in either tbh
---
so what you are saying is that instead of actually playing the game they quit like the losers they are because a bunch of random players would ruin their win rate and fast games....totaly winning.
---
I encourage the horde to full on turtle every match, alliance will either quit with the premades or just quit...maybe they will adapt (i doubt it)
---
Also mage prints gold, if you play shaman you're probably not going to have much farming options.
---
We swapped to LC some time ago. It can work, if people get a say in how it is designed and decisions are transparent, well motivated and up for discussion IF something seems very unfair - in my view, that is.
---
Our classleaders asked everyone to send in a 1-10 priority list to the classlead in question, he/she compiled it to a Google doc spreadsheet for the class members to review, and passed it on to guild lead/officers who meshed together all class lists. Some items are given class priority (BB  rogues &gt; fury &gt;&gt; hunters) etc. Some x-class items (rings/amus for instance) are either dealt out in a specific order (LC determined, written down) or round robin style, with LCs having the final say. Even so, the decisions should have a proper motivation behind them. Bindings etc were LCd to MT and OT first, which just makes sense.
---
So yes; I think it can be a good system, but that requires fair and transparent leadership and good communication, as well as agreement and patience from the members.
---
It's automatic
---
Not promoting just stating my experience. Since op asked I just want him to know u have to be extra prepared as a hunter to win a fight. But what happens when another class ur facing came just as prepared? Do u win? Maybe do u lose? Most likely. I agree with ur statement in another reply ‚Äúez to play hard to master‚Äù  if u aren‚Äôt prepared as a hunter ur pretty fucked once they abuse ur dead zone.
---
How are bots even a thing? I naively googled them when classic launched and it seems like very dodgy territory.
---
Nice?
---
I got gatorbite around 50 and ran it all the way to rends, was a nice upgrade and I was happy to run mara a few times for the ring (I got both on my 2nd run!)
---
i sure do sir -  [https://www.twitch.tv/skitzyotv](https://www.twitch.tv/skitzyotv)
---
It's bis for a very long time. It's a pretty good time investment to get.
---
YOU'RE GOING TO KISS VERY VERY SLOWLY
---
Just get one piece at a time. It doesn't have to be the first item you get, but it will last you a loooong time. You can duo farm arena with a healer or do arena-angerforge runs for hoj as well. My suggestion is get hitcapped first, 6% hit. If you're non-orc/human getting edgemaster's should be another priority. After that start farming chest. Good luck. üòä
---
Weakauras has an AV timers plugin
---
I came
---
Also nope, usually works that they use the toons to farm the gold -&gt; picking up anchor weed node by 20 toons at the same time takes the same time as picking it by one :)
---
Go wait in your queue.
---
Try to rearrange some of your IRL program (not always possible, hence the "try") and squeeze out as much AV you can in one whole day. If you got herb or mining, spend the time in queue squeezing out some profit, else you can farm some elementals hoping for Essence drops, or Satyrs for Demonic runes/felcloth/runecloth/gold. There is plenty to do in-between those queues, especially if you spec 30/0/21. Did this stuff as deep resto, and worked out pretty well. 
---
Queues suck, but make the most of it. I don't see any (positive) change coming to AV anytime soon.
---
Im no hard core pvper. But i beat all melee classes without useing enginering unless my opponent start useing bombs aswell.
---
FD&gt;trap is such a stupid good CC. From there you stay at 41yds and no other class can touch you. 
---
If we are talking world pvp hunter is the best class in the game, period. Duels and BG‚Äôs have limitations in distance so you can‚Äôt kite at 41yds. But open world, if you open as a hunter there‚Äôs legit no way for any other class to even touch you.
---
When tanking 2-3 targets:
---
1. Build baseline threat. Do demoralizing roar once if there are more than 3 targets, otherwise swipe once or twice.
---
2. Maul each target once. If more than 50 rage, swipe once or twice.
---
3. Maul target A once or twice depending on when it'll die.
---
4. Switch to target B, the one that DPS should be focusing next
---
5. Maul target B once or twice to get ahead on threat
---
6. When DPS pull aggro on target A, taunt it then maul it.
---
5. Target A dies. Decide which target to maul next, if you should maul at all.
---
When you arrive at 5, if there are remaining mobs and they are healthy you will need to continue building threat in the same manner as before. If there are no mobs left, or they are low health and about to die you save rage for the next pull and repeat the same process again.
---
The basic idea here is to build the minimum amount of threat on target A that is required to tank it and to taunt it once you lose threat. Meanwhile you spend your time building threat on target B such that DPS will never take aggro of it. You keep cycling through targets in this way until there are no mobs left.
---
If you're tanking a pack of 4 or more targets, open with demo roar followed by tab target and swipe. DPS will inevitably take aggro on something. Taunt it once CC expires and use the same threat building method you learned earlier. Marking mobs properly and using taunt properly is what will allow you to build threat and keep it.
---
If DPS ignore your marks, oh well too bad for them. One of the most effective non-verbal tools in the tanks arsenal is the repair bill, which can be easily be administered to rambunctious DPS players on demand.
---
It's not broken. It's just that there are too many whinny fucking bitches like you on this sub. Every other post is some fucktard like you crying and it gets old. It's not blizzard's job to intervene in stopping behavior that violates no rules. It's your job to get the fuck over it.
---
Shaman does one role only in any serious group
---
I use ElvUI. When I make a new character, I can just copy the interface-settings from a different character via the in-game configuration tool and everything, not just UI, but also other addon settings, will be exactly as they are on the original profile. No errors.
---
I *get* that some people don't like addons or feel like some basically cheating, but this is a game that was made with customization in mind. Why not use that? Why make it so incredibly hard for yourself?
---
It does have a lot. But when it comes to support its the best class to play in my opinion. Druid and priest don't bring the same utility.
---
Ironforge should not have more then 1 instance is the point he's making...
---
No zone should have more then 1 instance per server.
---
Most addons also have profiles you can just copy in the game itself with
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong
---
Depends on the fight. If you tank is struggling to hold aggro of you when you are in full tier 2 then sure. That being said I would have to re-simulate this for a more accurate answer, but I remember there being a big difference in dps from BIS compared to full tier 2.
---
No problem mate. They do get ghost wolf! (Druid also gets travel form). Have fun with it! Enjoy the holidays:)!!
---
feels more like 95%
---
And you can wish for original comments.
---
Your answer can easily be answered by looking up drop chances of items in MC.
---
You are lucky.
---
Ok Boomer.
---
Read comments on wowhead site for schematic
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11827/schematic-lil-smoky#comments
---
Yea, it's small things like this that will determine which to use.
---
On packs of 3 or more you‚Äôre gonna wanna demo roar then spam swipe while tab targeting to get your auto attack on all the mobs, try to get faerie fire on them as well when low rage allows for it, I wouldn‚Äôt bother wasting extra rage on maul with large packs unless you have a bunch of rage to blow. 
---
Packs of two, you wanna alternate mail on each target, this should keep mobs attached to you unless you have a really BDD (big d*** dpser) in your group.
---
If it is an issue you can always ask for a second to pick up some threat before having the dps bomb the targets as well that extra second with demo roar and a swipe or two will glue the targets to you for the remainder of the encounter.
---
incap
---
Run in, die in the corner of the flagroom, kill 2-3 mobs guarding it, pick it up
---
Please, go on about how youre arent a whiny bitch.
---
The irony is palpable
---
as i said they couldn't care less about "winning". Winning to them is getting max honor and then the game ending in 10 minutes. That why they don't even bother defending they just want to get out and queue next. If you are ranking winning is being at the top of your server bracket not some arbitrary winrate in some PVE game mode.
---
This is about correct, ive leveled engineering on a couple characters and spent about this each time. Well maybe just a bit less considering the engineer kits will be making him some profit but not to much compared to buying everything your self.
---
Pretty sure many alliance only needed 7 minutes to win a few weeks ago lol
---
Finished my Ony attunement.
---
yeah so orc racial wouldnt effect this or would it?
---
LC is to stuff friends first. EPGP all the way.
---
So this is how ony gives head
---
i‚Äôve been using her today and you‚Äôre right about her being better. i have dark pact and that works the best with her right? just keep dark pacting and life draining?
---
Luckely alliance side isnt big and noone really cares about it. Maby go read some topics how alliance was gonna ruin av and wsg for horde.... KARMA
---
Try jumping and turning.
---
Well we wouldnt do it if you pugs werent such shit.  Sorry.
---
r/madlads
---
It's ZPearl
---
It has a whole part/frame plugin, but I only use it for Player and Target.
---
The only thing I dislike is the Class color for shaman is the pink for pally instead of the dark blue...
---
No fucking dummy.
---
Because every post that does not have a screen shot but still clearly shows what OP is trying to relay will have some fucktard commenting about print screen. Not because he cares, just that he read other people do it. And since normies can‚Äôt think for themself he just mindlessly comment what others have done before him.
---
Hence the normie pun. Dummy.
---
Yep that's pretty much it! Immolate + Corruption (+ Agony if the mob is hard to kill) + chain drain life. Dark pact if you need more mana, or lifetap of you're full life :).
---
Spirit is useless. Get big mana and health pool and you're good to go. When you're oom, just die and you're full mana again. That's how bgs work
---
I was about to say sure if your fine with a dps warrior rolling on tank gear.
---
I see your not ok with that and that makes you a hypocrite nice.
---
If you can call on tank and dps gear why cant he? Same shit ...
---
Dont tell me something about your ego as tank being too big ?
---
So is mage the best bg group pvpers?
---
Install questie. Use the quest markers to plan out a circular path in each zone. Follow your route and kill every green or yellow mob you come across along the way.
---
Leveling was built for grinding, and if you follow this method, you'll fly through levels and never be under leveled.
---
Want to heal ? Shaman
---
Want do dps ? Mage
---
Statistically, im in a semi-hardcore guild and i know at least 10 warriors  who farmed for it and how long it took them, plus myself. Either post your details engagement counter or stop confusing and lying to new people, you theorycrafting reddit garbage.
---
People who use BDS with chest are walking memes that heard BDS 3pc was good, didn't want to shell out for boots, and didn't want to farm SGC either.  It's  Shoulders/Legs/Boots or bust.
---
Like any mass hysterics, people seem to think you can't do MC or Onyxia without the best possible equipment.
---
100% as expected, 100% as history told us.
---
100% expected blizzard fucked up too.
---
Ignorance is bliss as they say
---
Alliance has far bigger problems than backdooring.
---
Is there any /script, /click or macro that can be used to press the ‚Äùleave battleground‚Äù button after it is finished?
---
This is endgame advice. It's true, but not relevant for leveling. And you shouldn't worry about this for now. By the time you're 60 you understand the class well enough to make this next step in the learning curve.
---
Blame Blizzard for making AV more honor than WSG, this is the obvious result.
---

You got lucky, and then claim that anyone higher than you is just lying lmao.  I got mine in 296 with a shit ton of Another warr in guild took 252, someone got it tonight in 115, one got it sub 50, and one more got it in his first 5.  Luck is luck.
---
296 runs takes \~24 hrs to actually complete at 4-5 mins per run.  You think a 24 hr grind over the span of 100+ days is unbelievable in a game with a PvP system where thousands of players have already dumped 400-500+ hrs into the first 44 days?  C'mon man, get some perspective.

Im a priest and whole I was doing a dungeon while still leveling, Cassandra's Grace dropped (now healer head) I didn't even know it was Pre raid bis, but I rolled need, coz upgrade, tank asked me why I need rolled. I said, "I roll need because it's a healer item and an upgrade, isn't that how this works?" I hadn't even realis d it was worth quite a lot because Pre raid bis. He just asked me to equip it then, and we went on. He ended up friending me because the dps'ers were shit, He was a good tank, and so I thanked him for his tanking at the end of the raid even though we wiped a few times due to DPS not listening and an afk. Most people seem reasonable. Need if you gonna use it is how I understand it, bit I'm a noob *shrug

everything checks out, except the boobs.

It's a screenshot from a really zoomed out perspective
---
100g up front, 100g when it drops. Unlimited runs.
---
This discussion seems to pop up every day. 
---
First of all, to answer your question: you aren‚Äôt a ninja, because the rules about BoEs weren‚Äôt discussed beforehand. It makes sense you rolled need.
---
However, it is also true that expensive BoEs or recipes are worth EXACTLY the same amount to everyone in the party. As a user, you save the money you would‚Äôve had to spend on buying the recipe, which is the same amount a non-user gets from selling the item. BoE drops should be seen as gold and nothing but gold. Whether or not you can use the item does not affect that.
---
Therefore, the logical thing to do when a BoE drops is for everyone to roll need.
---
Because I know some dumbass will compare this to vendoring BoPs:
---
This does not apply to BoPs for two reasons.
---
1. You cannot buy BoPs on demand for the same amount it vendors for. 
---
2. The covert contract. A priest won‚Äôt roll on the Warrior‚Äôs 2H sword, despite the high value, because the Warrior won‚Äôt roll on the +healing gear. Both players are better off by passing BoPs to those who can equip them.
---
Just maxed out the camera
---
Yep incendius is great. About a 55/45 alliance split and always high pop.

Where did you farm to bust out that kind of cash?

As an alchemist I 100% agree with you. I always says to the persons in the group that I can craft the thing for them for free with there mats. None have picked me up on that.
---
There is a button for greed and that‚Äôs the greed button. As people don‚Äôt respect that or have other selfish reason, all use the need button which drives me crazy.
---
who cares
---
Currently doing The Hinterlands (as horde), and hating it with a deep passion. Will the upcoming zones be any better? Feeling a bit of a burnout
---
Unless I'm mistaken, it works on grenades, which are also incaps.  It should work the same way for repentance, but I'm not 100%.
---
Youve started reviving free gold/gear and watching youtube videos while earning thousands of dollars?
---

---
Its not really a meme, because hes actually balding...
---
What's wrong with hinterlands? Loved that zone
---
I have this on my H Pally, the damage shield isn't what's good, it's the Mp5.  Very easy to keep the buff in 5 mans, I won't be using it for raiding though.
---
Honestly, just go prot. You'll find dungeon groups immediately, and gear up a lot faster. Then once you're geared up a bit in some pre-raid BiS, you can try out fury tanking.
---
There's never any guarantees, but being part of the .7% unluckiest is something nobody ever expects.
---
Breath has a cast time. If you‚Äôre low and see breath coming you pot or last stand. If you have competent healers you don‚Äôt even need to do that though.

Nice one man! Love when someone goes the extra mile to make classic questing a bit easier!

Hunters are the best gold farmers in Classic. And they're average in DPS (not the best, but far from bad).
---
If you're planning on being a speedrunner, go for mage or warrior. But if you plan on playing normally, there will always be a place for a hunter in raids.
---
Eh. Show me the entire screenshot so I can make sure that this isn't the graveyard that people are resurrecting at.
---
I'm not saying afkers aren't an issue, but I've been grinding 400k-600k honor weekly since AV released and I've never seen this many in 1 game, so color me skeptical.
---
Seems MUCH more likely to me that these people were on defense and Stormpike, Aid Station, and Stonehearth gys are horde controlled making the cave the only spot you can be resurrected.
---
....yet alliance have a fucking bridge to defend with while horde's base is jump over a wsll
---
holy crab sticks! thanks
---
Got sgc, still not seen hoj. Instructions unclear.
---
There nearly 1 million fury warrs on WCL right now.  Idk why #3 is unbelievable to you at all.
---
As for #4, sure.  Just troubleshoot whatever the hell: "Details!: Fail to open 'Details! Storage', maybe the addon is disabled?" means for me.
---
How turns have tabled
---
This is true, but there are a LOT of premades right now.
---
Not to mention waiting till BWL to MC the goblin to teach someone to smelt elementium.
---
If you use modifiers for different ranks of the spells, I'd recommend putting the spell you use less often on the modifier, not the one you use more often. So in Fireball's case rank 1 on the Shift modifier and max rank without the modifier.
---
Xperl is cringe

Get TSM, it will show you a tooltip with the market value on your realm/faction based on price history.

I updated the discord link.  Thanks for your help in debugging

I'd take 20 min ques all day over spamming AV in AV literally every second of the day without having time to take a shit.

This doesn't work? Also, it's better to just have Herb / Mining + Skinning if you're doing professions for gold, but you do you.
---
Depends, what if you have 11 but then you constantly get fucked? You can have virtually 'infinite' people who stack up to 11, before anyone gets the full trinket
---
maybe alliance had the advantage in the pre-nerfed AV when NPCs actually did shit, but in this version horde just wins due to reaching Balinda faster than alliance reach Galv
---
By "good," you mean "if you have a massive amount of time to put into the game"
---
I guess you can't have a discussion with people who don't even know what statistics means. It doesn't matter what any anecdotal evidence means here as the drop rate as a whole as I discussed above still stands unless you know something we don't?
---
Gear is a part of pvp and life in classic, you can't separate that from pvp itself and class strength imo should be based on between prebis and bis because thats a reasonable place to get with rng accounted for. Warlocks for instance are the best pvp dps class, the best at 1v1s too but next to warrior are the second most gear dependent. That's ok though it feels great to crit for 2222 on instant cast shadowbolts from a nightfall proc üòéüéÜ
---
All u have to do is copy the settings from one folder to another like someone already mentioned above.
---
Not that uncommon and here I am close to 100 runs in a group of 2 and we only found 3 books at all and just a single one beeing on the ground.
---
Is this subreddit fine with making fun of other peoples looks?
---
I think with a coordinated group, dungeon runs could be strong xp. But yeah, the travel time + recruiting + waiting makes it not great exp
---
You‚Äôre so virtuous
---
Another piece of advice would be to use the Wolfshead Helm for trash packs. While the stats are bad, the option to set yourself to 15 rage instantly by leaving and reentering form helps a lot with keeping aggro from a pack of mobs.
---
Hey look into melee hunter, nightfall is god tier in end game raids and late into classic a hunter spamming melee spells has the highest proc rate of any class to keep the +15% spell dmg up and it sounds fun to play I mained hunter TBC/vanilla to cata and played WoD and legion and I went warlock (my second main) this time for classic but im gonna also level a melee hunter going tauren for pvp melee swing length lol.
---
Jesus that‚Äôs so rare! Grats!
---
If only
---
I see what you mean.
---
TBH, as my hunter is approaching 60, I'm pondering if I should invest much time into getting the Savage Gladiator Chain or just settle for Beaststakler's Tunic (about 10x the drop rate and way less competition) and invest that time into getting the t1 chest piece.
---
Your dad needs a rez.
---
You can take a shit whenever you want. The premades run every 5 minutes so you won't miss much.
---
Is it possible? Yea.
---
What's more likely. Some fucktard on Reddit did 50 runs, didn't get it and quit, then came on Reddit and to bitch and complain while lying turning 50 runs into 500... or some guy that actually did 508 runs without seeing it. Like honestly. The dude is full of it.
---
Scattershot. If you are going into a 1v1 somewhat evenly (you both looked each other down and started mobilizing) there is no excuse to auto lose. We have a ton of stuff in our kit, you just aren‚Äôt spec‚Äôd for pvp. Doing the top damage isn‚Äôt always the answer
---
Horde are ugly and their leveling zones are ugly. People only roll Horde because they want an unfair advantage in PvP. Orc Hardiness racial is stupidly powerful in PvP and Undead Will of the Forsaken makes fighting Warlocks and Priests a joke.
---
Merry Christmas and enjoy your PvP queues. It's what you signed up for, after all.
---
Asmonbald
---
We tend to use RC Loot Council addon on which has streamlined things a lot
---
The kinds of warrs that are farming SGC this hard could've crafted a dozen LHHs at this point, and probably used their 30 mins of downtime after locks to do just that.
---
Fury is far and away the most tryhard spec to gear in the game.  It's no surprise that you see a lot of nolifing from warrs for a chest that isn't marginally upgraded until AQ.
---
Hell, I'm 400+ hours deep 1/3 of the way through R9 myself atm just so I can get R10 shoulders for the ideal 2pc setup for PvE.  I've never seen a # of kills anywhere from details, but I'll def look for you next time I help someone (which will likely be Tues when I can finally leave AV).  FYI, I've been helping 2 more warrs work on it, so my # will be even more inflated.
---
And if you question my claims of being a tryhard, feel free to look me up on WCL.  It won't be hard to find me, I promise.
---
Right, and i have 3 guildmates with Deathcharger's reigns
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they state that epics gotten before p5 wouldn't disenchant into crystals?
---
2FA is such a waste of time most of the time tho
---
Don‚Äôt most addons have a built in profile? Every time i make a new character, i just go to the profile tab of the addon, select my main, and each addon will perform and look the same as it does on my main. Takes 20-40 seconds and it‚Äôs all internal.
---
Yeah asmon is like that
---
Not sure about that. It takes 5-6 queues usually to get everyone in the same BG. So that means even though the premade wins 20/20 BGs, the other 80 we didn't enter were probably all losses unless another premade got into one.
---
Thanks. 
---
Yea I saw it was at 0. I don't really get it. Post some legit info for this guy and get downvoted for it. Welcome to Reddit I guess.
---
i won't read that clueless wall of text, pm me a screenshot some time
---
You can gey flurry axe, if i remember correctly it is good while leveling. In my server prices around 75 g but if you can spare money i'd say you should spare for your epic mount
---
Trolls are not people, they are trolls.
---
I did not say it's impossible, it's not effective and too expensive. You choose to be a stuck up ignorant kid about this whole topic, so this is my last post.
---
I wonder how long horde queues would be if it wasn't for all those afkers.
---
Me, no way I wouldn't turn mad being watched by so much people. Almso my stream would get banned in hours at best.
---
Ask anyone who is on alliances premaid groups and they will tell you they do.
---
Horde cannot pull without Marshalls. That‚Äôs only alliance privilege.
---
Wanted to add primal fury works by adding 5 rage for every thing you crit. If all three targets receive a crit from swipe you get back the 15rage, if only 2 then u just spend 5 rage to swipe. Powerfully when used with omen of clarity that procs several times a min.  If omen procs on a goods crit swipes (2 of 3 each time) you can usually swipe 3 to 4 times in a row from zero rage.
---
blatantly false.
---
idiots like you should really leave our server.
---
Haha, sure you didn't bud.  You can get of my WCL page now.
---
Let me get a reminder up for Tues.
---
RemindMe! 5 days

You have a discord invite?

Haha, right on. Merry Christmas man. Cheers
---
Yes. Don't listen to all the pussies in this threat. Go farm it.

premades are a bug now, huh?

Cheers bro, Merry Christmas!

I‚Äôll hit up YouTube for some stuff

Curse got bought out by Twitch a few years back. So you used to get addons from Curse back in the day, they developed a curse app, which has now become the Twitch app. The twitch app let's you sync all your addons on multiple devices as well as auto update and keep all your addons up to date so you don't have to keep downloading, extracting, dragging, and dropping every time a new update comes out. Takes all the heavy lifting out of addons.
---
I have done so many arena/angerforge runs to help a buddy get HoJ.  In that time frame we only saw this guy maybe 2-3 times? in over 50 runs. If the drop rate was higher on that guy, maybe, but for a random spawn AND a low drop rate, I wouldn't chance it, but if you have the time and the luck, you are more than welcome to try. Just giving you a realistic view.
---
I don‚Äôt have the money for either. Currently a 53 orc. Thanks for advice!
---
The quests feel very uninspired. Here go like 45 trolls, here go kill 60 high elfes. The corpse run in 5-10 minutes long, the quest hub is very far off.
---
 
---
Sadly I am level 46 right now so the elite quests are a no go right now
---
Yup I did exactly that.
---
ye, and then you have forced a turtle
---
Does this actually work. I would download this app just to do this. Plan on transfering to higher pop realm and would love to mess with people lol.
---
I'd dont personally care, but how is that not immersion breaking? Getting the gold of every humanoid in the area by looting only one of them? What does the money do, teleport to that single corpse?
---
She gave birth to a knife?

Because it's cross-realm.

There's much better looking unit frames out there.

I always listen to the ingame music. Have done it since 2004. I love it. I even had it on my phone a while and listened to it while driving.

Made of wool yes.

Real horde rankers have it bad unfortunately though since honor per hour is super rng
---
Good luck going from WC to RFK.
---
I am alliance ret paladin with no epic mount yet and I am still really clueless about AV.
---
Normally I just follow the others, but sometimes it' hard to keep up with a slower mount. So if possible I push Galv(?) and then just fight with the others.
---
Can someone explain what I should do in my case if for instance I cannot get to my mates because I get killed on my way there? Anything I should try to capture alone or something?
---
Maybe a quick and simple video out the explaning stuff? Unfortunately I feel like there is very less explaining in Classic since people feel like everyone knows everything about this game already.
---
Just to get dispelled by a priest.
---
So yeah. Let‚Äôs honor multiboxers some more, since they are such a great asset to this game.
---
But alliance can't admit they have advantages too. They need to fit their victim role! Add a transfer button that let's them swap through AVs until they got the upper hand!
---
I'm sorry but thank you, this was the fire lit under me that I needed to finally set up the 2fa. Again, I am sorry to hear about your misfortune but I do have hope that you can get things restored! GL!
---
Is that just having an authenticator or is there something more?
---
How do you make chain heal go where you want it to so you can make figures like this. Wont the chain heal start healing random people?
---
What is it with warriors not wanting to go prot? You got a ""get out of lfg free" card and dont wanna use it.
---
Do all of us none warriors a favor and go prot. To use this greaft gift you have available and also to GET US A TANK!
---
Never notice. Ever.
---
Yup and mine says 1 day and 18 hours for a wait time... Beautiful when you take into account that I am hard grinding rank and will very likely derank, because of this bullshit.
---
lol gratz.
---
Huh, guess what's confusing me is the ability to zerker rage out of those too.
---
Also, it used the term "Stun" in the tooltip, but it also shows this on that page:
---
 Apply Aura: Stun  
---
Value: 2  
---
Mechanic: Incapacitated  
---
Radius: 3 yards 
---
I'm still pretty sure it's an incap, but won't claim to be 100% on this.
---
Like I'm not trying to rub salt in the wounds right now, but this right here is why everyone says to use 2fa over and over and over. 
---
Shit isn't a joke. Hopefully some people here see this thread and finally decide to enable 2fa.
---
Bagnon?  Takes like 2 seconds to organize.
---
Even better is that he is likely on an alt reddit account defending himself as the user talking to you is on a new acct with less than 300 karma.
---
Also a cancelform cast castform one button macro for instant 10 rage then whatsthatmakerage skill with the talent for another instant 10 rage and hit the rage to health skill for some lovely healing.
---
As an orc do not buy edgemasters. Just use axes and save your gold.
---
the market always moves and sways, it just takes someone buying all of the ones up and putting them back for more
---
To be fair, the raiding community is much more informed and better as a whole than nearly all of the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù guilds of Vanilla. More guilds will clear it compared to then, but the consume cost will push many away.
---
They're with the perspective of someone who knows how gearing change as a naxx-geared tank. You might have missed his newer stuff.
---
Most of his advice is for starting raid tanks, from the twelve or so videos I've watched. In most of them, he says "don't Fury Prot tank unless you're geared" and even has a video covering specifically when you want to switch to Fury Prot.
---
Isn't Don Julio's an upgrade for warriors?
---
I just gave up PvP. I had two Rank11s and one Rank13 in Vanilla and I just can't bother anymore with that terrible PvP-System.
---
Or Violet Hold
---
I‚Äôd say get a tombstone breastplate or Cadaverous and call it a day.
---
ask her the drop rate of her panties.
---
Arms warriors are just trash in raid but totally viable in dungeons and great at pvp. You can totally tank every dungeon in arms, go pvp and then go farm mobs. I‚Äôve tried arms/fury prot/deep prot and arms (I feel) has the most utility. Has great initial aoe (sweeping strikes then WW) that gives you control of the majority of mobs and then you can start tossing sunders around. For non 60 dungeons I hardly have to go to defensive stance and am getting too one or two on dps.
---
This made the whole story worth it.
---
Arms can tank dungeons just fine! Throw on a shield and you're good to go assuming your team is decent
---
There's just no getting through to some people. 'waste of time' to secure your account in like 5 minutes. What a fucking joke.
---
¬´¬†Most¬†¬ª guild but not all guild. I‚Äôm in a guild that raid at 23h00
---
[Our fuckin' warchief said, "WHO'S BEEN DRAWING DICKS?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDecYCBn5Kw&amp;t=20s)
---
Multi shot is a motherfucker regardless of skill and gear level... trust me, also a Bear here
---
A warrior does not need to go prot to tank dungeons. Just slap a tank set on.
---
Wait the horde faction needs 40 active players to win AV? Noobs.
---
You should look into late-night raiding guilds. On a few EU servers there are guilds that raid at 22:00.
---
Yeah I was a lot like OP I think; my enh shaman had a bunch of SM gear ready at 40 and was very skeptical about how much better it would be to respec. I did it anyway just to try it and I've never looked back. Elemental is WAY faster and better right now, currently in my mid 40's with mostly shitty green gear. The Elemental Mastery spell batching (chain+earth shock) alone nearly one-shots most mobs my level. 
---
As enhancement it fell like I had to drink after every mob. As elemental it's definitely at least 3 mobs before I need to drink, and sometimes with good talent procs and elemental mastery you can go a lot more.
---
Definitely give it a try
---
Exalted with Frostwolf and I haven't had a single game where the whole team did this. If I'm *really* lucky there is one other person that goes there so we can cap gy, that's it.
---
There‚Äôs organised and there‚Äôs organised tho, just cause it‚Äôs in my bags or bank doesn‚Äôt mean I want it there
---
yeah, already have it also
---
Not with 42 spellpower. My highest crit is 1.2k
---
You want to rank with that little time? (For threat gear/fury prot the PvP warrior set is crazy good. The r12/13 full set is kinda bis until AQ)
---
I am Horde, did not see any guild in Pyrewood Village that raids late.
---
I hope you are patient, because I submitted a ticket 2 days ago and still got nothing... rofl
---
Is there a way to add guild name near player name ? plz
---
thequartering is his new idol now, not TB. TB wouldn't be this kind of retarded, atleast i don't think he would.
---
Honestly yeah, you‚Äôre not getting that mount money in pvp and you put yourself and your team at a huge disadvantage
---
Because if you want to raid as warr, you're likely going to be bottlenecked into the guild's 12th or lower fury slot because:
---
1.) If a guild is actually using deep prot warrs, you can count them on one hand that's been in a terrible farming accident.
---
2.) Many guilds are using fury/prot warrs in the current raiding climate.  I'm not going to pretend to know the ratio of fury/prot to deep prot tanks across all raiding guilds, but the demand for them was already going to be low due to ratios of tanks to raid slots, and has fallen even further with the efficiency of fury/prot.
---
Market is pretty self regulating. I have sbout 30 essences of water. If you increase the price by a good chunk I will put mine on the market.
---
If you only have 7/8 percent hit, will you land most of your attacks? Probably. But it leaves the door open to miss on that critical dispel or interrupt. That‚Äôs the real reason for being hit capped.
---
Sorry about the immature toxic replies you got hope you do well and if you find the time later game will still be here :)
---
Wow, what a dick move.
---
Great idea! Now I have to level a character on a pvp server.

Here's a link the the section of TOS that says it is. Not my [words](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

---
that only used to be the case when it was released. I cant remember the last time i put in the code, that includes when I forget to turn off my vpn.
---
For a lots of things yes, but not for [battle.net](https://battle.net). It remembers your IP address I think so only when you login  from new locations or with a vpn.
---
Very weird. I remember blinking out of the stun.
---
As always, it depends on timing, I'd like to think people aren't at their computers 24/7, but even if they sold 1/4 of their stock at inflated prices, they may have already made up the difference in purchasing.
---
I'm not an AH micro manager (can't even string together enough for an epic mount), but when I was trying to catch mats for gear, it was crazy how much they swing, and until you get a feel for the market, you get screwed by impatience lol.
---
I can understand multiboxing in EVE online, but in wow? They annoy me when I encouter them. They break my immersion. Oh yeah and the economy.
---
Pretty much. The epic mount is an upfront admittance fee. Not having the mount makes you less of an asset and will end up hurting your team. Since you're not going to reliably earn that much gold doing PvP, it's best to get it done up front.
---
wooo
---
I switched before transfers were allowed, re-rolled alliance on Pagle.
---
&gt;Warrior does more threat
---
No. They don't. 
---
&gt;,has better mitigation, has shield wall, last stand, life giving gem
---
Yes, but it's not necessary to have. 
---
&gt;and superior itemization. 
---
No idea what you mean by that. Druids scale really well from gear too and will always out threat a warrior without thunderfury. 
---
&gt;Stand up for the feral all you want, no one wants to play with it.
---
Main tanking as feral for my guild. We do Ony and MC with ease. There are also multiple recordings of druids tanking every AQ40 and Naxx boss that has been tanked by warriors.
---
Give them a weekly quest to kill 25 horde player to get their weekly raid-tier gear reward so they won't cry.
---
Do you have you mount? I don‚Äôt think the immovable object is worth the gold in my opinion. I don‚Äôt recall the stats being that much better than the draconian (I could be wrong though). But the lobotomizer is a good pick up.
---
I leveled ele 1-60 at launch. Raid ele too.
---
I hate the auto organiser and sorta hate the one bag thing too. I like having separate bags for separate things. A consumes bag, key items bag, off set bag etc. I feel the whole one big bag thing is a mess.
---
Right click and talk with the NPC has helped me before
---
I had the same complaint about Ravager. Replaced it asap. Found myself clicking the buff from ravager to stop the annoying spin. My WF proc was way more productive.
---
This is only with specific ui addons
---
We just had 25 on defense, stopped them mid while taking Balinda, slowly pushed north with continued defense, and still lost in 14 minutes
---
Not against a premade.
---
This is true RIGHT NOW, but it depends.
---
It was NOT true before all of the good alliance players stopped queuing after the first few days when they hit exalted. Hordies will be in denial about this, but we were winning 7 minute matches over and over and over again with PuGs, we hit exalted, got our epics shit, and now horde are left playing scrubs and drooling on themselves saying, "*look mommy, we win every game now, derp a herp derp*!"
---
Enjoy those queues boys! hahahaha
---
Never heard of him. To me Asmongold is way more famous.
---
I don't think that's possible without some extra app you need to install or a manual sync
---
They definitely don't, I use the hp pot/healthstone combo a lot in pvp on my lock.
---
I‚Äôve never been hacked since I got an Authenticator years ago. Call blizzard instead of putting in a ticket. I‚Äôve always had instant results instead of waiting on some over worked cs employee to read your hastily written ticket.
---
flametongue weapons with a shield always works well. Maybe get a nice dagger and switch to. Enhancement does have good talents for leveling imo, but maybe lightning bolts work for some people.
---
https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=shaman&amp;t=w6xcxdxexfBoBpBqBrBsyhytygyuyvycyCyDyEyFydypyqyrysyiJkJlw5xpxq something like this seems real good, would be very tempting to go for 10% weapon damage next.
---
They definitely should, especially if you are alliance. I really enjoy the free honor from those.
---
Also if you have the cash buy all the pages from the ah for STV easy xp for hardly any gold
---
Don‚Äôt think op can access the account.
---
If you‚Äôre losing 1v1s to warriors, rogues, shamans, or mages they should be heavily outgearing you.
---
Spend 12silver on a greater mana potion
---
please sir, link me to your livestream/logs and share these youtube videos. can't wait to see the new druid meta evolve!
---
If reserves are spread out, 'more people get loot' I didn't say more loot is dropped. It's not hard to comprehend.
---
I believe hunters are pretty good at shooting the cocoons on Maexxna in addition to tranq shot.
---
Scummy people man.
---
smh
---
This guy is clearly living his best life.
---
Make any more progress?
---
There's a few things my guild takes into account: attendance, performance, willingness to help other guildees, how frequently they are logged in, etc.
---
Yeah no shit it doesn‚Äôt work for Horde lol. But you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúfuck the alliance for using third party applications to que premade‚Äù as if they are cheating when all they are doing is using DBM. An Add-on both factions use. If you wanted instant que‚Äôs you shoulda rolled alliance it was obvious from the beginning that this was gonna happen. Tbh it‚Äôs a fair trade off for what alliance went through the first couple months of the game.
---
Okay that‚Äôs legit. The 2 set bonus is also very good but best with shoulders and pands. Shoulders are r10 unfortunately
---
Hello, guy who raided with a bunch of meme and sub optimal specs here. My guild actually had moonkins and an enhance shaman(not nightfall) as well as wayyy too many hunters and warlocks. You know what? Still cleared MC through AQ40 while that content was relevant and got most of naxx down too.  Obv we were never going to finish it, what wish some bosses being actual checks to see if your guild makeup is or isn't retarded, but damn still had lots of fun.
---
Aye! XD
---
Dang Activision-Hasbro = the ultimate low effort team.  How can we take something that already exists, mix it around a little bit and get people to pay more than full price?
---
Money in the bank.
---
That was off memory, I resimmed it now and Ogre Forged comes out 0.5 dps ahead of Deathdealer Breastplate (from brd).
---
SGC is 7 dps ahead.
---
Blizz needs to break the premade thing.
---
Meanwhile my guild has seen 0 bindings, 1 mageblade, 1 healer mace and 2 staff of dom and 0 eyes.
---
Do you see a spirit rezzer to talk to?
---
Activision-Hasbro it's a match made in heaven.
---
Get a moon cloth bag or the demon hide satchel then
---
And what does that number you get from dividing those give you? It doesn't matter how long it takes when it's the only way to increase your DPS further.
---
Thanks for this! I do a lot of digital drawing for work and I'm always looking for new playlists
---
Best system is loot council and have your officers make a list so people know what the order is for certain items.
---
No?
---
To be fair, i grinded from 1-60 as enhance. I just popped a totem and then tabbed until it died, healed and repeat. Probably looked like a true bot.
---
The icon is still different though, lol. Logic plays no part in why this bothers me a little.
---
I use the excel sheet from the Fight Club discord. Seems to be the most reliable source.
---
https://discord.gg/fightclub
---
Huh? First of all, this is my main. I don‚Äôt even have a level 60. So I‚Äôm def. not min maxing. Second of all everyone in my guild seems super chill and everyone is friendly. 
---
Who hurt you??
---
It‚Äôs crazy how many alliance posts there are complaining and when horde was majority losing there was hardly any posts at all about it.... why does the alliance have such a ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù complex?
---
&gt;you dont know shit then
---
I know plenty you moron, on any remotely populated server too honor guys are averaging 150-180k.honor a day on horde side while botters are getting 100k, just stop talking out of your moronic ass
---
yes i already have a very fast mount.
---
I think Foror's compendium needs that i go kill onyxia, and its not easy for me because of raiding time
---
Hunters are amazing in PVP but shit in PVE. Some people just can't deal with the deadzone though, you'll need to test it out and see if you actually like playing a hunter.
---
what is the right answer? you must know it since you said all the answers given were wrong
---
Thanks dude! I get super happy every time I look at it now :)
---
So as I normally go Av and tank NPCs i think i will stick with DD.
---
Thank you
---
I see what you're saying, but both characters in question (OP and his wife) were on the same server to begin with. They WOULDN'T wanna split that up if they're combating low pop.
---
but you can proc windfury during the spin
---
Because they're stats that improve your character. It's fine to weigh them 0 as far as a DPS increase, but to consider them literally worthless is a mistake.
---
End game weapon prog is quest bow, smiting , slavemaker iirc.
---
We have yet to give a mageblade to a paladin in our loot council. This isn't due to some misunderstanding that it isn't good for them, we fully understand that it's BiS.
---
The issue is that in the current way the raids go, there is more value in prioritizing it to DPS. We're never struggling with healing on fights, so ending them quicker with higher DPS gives the most value. 
---
There is an argument to be made that gearing out healing would allow for the shedding of healer spots in favor of DPS to pursue the same goal. We've avoided this approach though, since making healer raid spots more scarce would lead with higher attrition.
---
I feel like we're to the point of starting to give paladins consideration on the item since we've gotten a few though.
---
Perd blade drops way more than Viskag, and rogue generally prefer swords.
---
LOL blizzard just let us queue with groups we're doing it anyway and fucking up the game in the processes
---
hahahaaha. OG wow bags ftw
---
Well, no difference to normal games. Im alliance, and every single game is 0 honor 20min in. So im just saying it barely makes a difference, sadly.
---
Sounds about right. I use mana pots before gem at rag because then I can decide between mana pot and fire res pot after the cd. In that case: pot, ruby, robe. If you down rag really quickly its probably better to ruby, robe, pot. But since you are apparently using your citrine too, this doesn't seem to be the case. 
---
I rarely need more than robe and ruby in any other fight than rag.
---
TukUI, with Titan Panel at the top
---
That shaman multi box must be fucking horrifying/terrifying when coming across an Alliance. He can probably one shot 60's with frost shocks, with the amount that shamans they have its riDICKuslus.
---
So the problem was that the others had already rolled greed. I think that‚Äôs what caused the drama. 
---
The idea behind ‚Äúall need or all greed‚Äù is commented below and I get that now. I still don‚Äôt know if I agree. An alch recipe is worth more to an alchemist than it is to a tailor. I think the only way to keep this issue clean in dungeons is to talk about BoE drops before we get started.
---
actually yeah. i have a 60% and its why i don't AV much yet. Always fall behind, get sapped, get wrecked. Same story every time lol
---
Honestly in MC I barely have time to use any mana gems / pots at all
---
Ah, alright, so you know the rules and so do I?
---
When i ask in chat I can usually get 1 or 2 people to help me snowball them out through the portal.
---
Gives them the deserter debuff and boots them.
---
It's fairly easy catching anyone doing repetitive behavior, especially when machine learning is applied.
---
If I were working for Blizzard I would (I'm pretty sure they are doing this already)  do large-scale behavioral analysis (movement patterns, npc killing patterns, object/node farming patterns etc) and combine this with machine learning to automatically detect such behavior. That in itself is not too challenging if you have all the necessary data. 
---
I did something similar on Light's Hope with very limited data and I was able to determine bots (level and farming) with a decent accuracy, around 80%, which is not bad judging by the little data I had available.
---
However the challenge with RMT is differentiating beween RMT and legit transactions, in order to do this automatically with high accuracy there are very many factors that come into consideration which makes this task very challenging.
---
I am pretty sure that Blizzard already has tools and machine learning in place to combat things like bots and RMT, but perfecting it takes time and knowledge. I am also pretty sure Blizzard already automatically bans people to a certain degree (using these methods) but it seems to be fairly relaxed at the moment.
---
The idea of killing Van before towers cap when we are going to win is stupid. 
---
Yes if you wait you get bonus honor, but then that‚Äôs atleast a minute longer queuing and that minute is wasted, no two, no honor, can‚Äôt be farming or whatever else.
---
If you wait on Van you can spend that minute in AV getting hand ins in (Rep), Mulv might be close in that case there‚Äôs a potential 300 rep, you can farm more Alliance for more honor etc. when Van dies and you queue you will be in AV again the exact time as waiting after Van for towers with more rep or honor.
---
This is great but it's gonna get a letter from blizzard, isn't it?
---
Can‚Äôt help with YouTube suggestions but below was my weapon progression. 
---
I used a bow the whole time leveling up. This was only due to what I happened to get drop wise and quest wise. If you get a great gun to drop go for it! Xbow will be even better! Generally you will want slower weapons (less ammo consumption and higher Aim and Multi when you get them). 
---
Leveling:
---
- Orcish Battle bow from Centaur Bracers lvl 9 quest in the barrens 
---
- Venom strike from WC (don‚Äôt go nuts getting this, I never got it) 
---
- Bow of Plunder from Dangerous! Lvl 19 Quest in Hillsbrad (get a higher level to help with this, the earlier you get it the better it is) 
---
- Master Hunter‚Äôs Bow from Big Game Hunter lvl 28 quest (again the earlier you can get this the better) 
---
- Verdant Keeper‚Äôs Aim from Maraudon Quest lvl 45 (again the earlier you can get this the better. This bow lasted me to 60)
---
With AV out you can get bloodseeker as soon as you‚Äôre able to win an AV
---
get another bag and use the pumpkin in your bank
---
I am on the Tirion chain, currently on the quest involving going to get the note behind the paining in Strath
---
Is it the guy from shazzrah server?
---
This game isn't hard, even with stock UI. I have a few addons (ClassiCastBars, Auctionator, Questie, some bag one), but some people have complete UI overhauls that just feel so unnecessary. And a lot of them even more confusing.
---
90 minutes? Aw man my last one took 120 :(
---
Lol asmon is a fucking cunt.
---
As the only dagger rogue in my guild still hunting for my Perdition's Blade, it hurts my heart when I run into a warrior running PD.
---
The one time this happened to me, I was able to fix it by logging into wow on a different computer to force-kick myself off.
---
gladiator chain in 50 arena runs (2 days) .. hoj in 15 runs.. I consider myself lucky
---
You realise that there are millions of people who don't even celebrate Christmas, as well as millions of others who celebrate Christmas on a different day?
---
Yeah I did like an hour of work. It has some work left to do, mostly asking for upvotes due to how reddit will ratelinif it
---
They say Karma is a bitch. 
---
I'm on a US server and see the slow trickle of alliance joining AV. Failed pre-made; it's glorious!
---
This one gave a good laugh
---
Sure you could I just wasn't.
---
isnt mana tide garbage? its on a 5 min cooldown and barely restores any mana?
---
Ah, I think only the first part where you kill a bunch of mobs really needs a solo spec.
---
Oh and you should probably do Hydraxian quest, you'll have to kill some elementals in EPL and Silithus and it's not fun to do with a healing build (especially if your wand does nature damage).
---
They just farm herbs on their 10 accounts and sell em right?
---
Yall need some read comedy in your lives.
---
Experience is big chunk of Alliance AFK when Horde are going to win as they can just insta join next match.
---
Idk you brought it up so you tell me lol.  I initially responded to your crying about AV, and then you bragged about being the "winner" because you reached a joke of a rep goal, something most Alliance reached 24-48 hrs after AV launched.
---
&gt;And what does that number you get from dividing those give you?
---
Broken down to its simplest for your looking at dps increase per whatever unit of time you prefer. 
---
&gt;It doesn't matter how long it takes when it's the only way to increase your DPS further.
---
In World of Warcraft there are actually further ways to increase your DPS.
---
Low level people can at least make themselves useful snowballing AFKers out of the portal to boot them. Or snowballing enemy players off towers / bridge.
---
I'm not sure what the best farming methods are but ye I hear you can farm enough gold relatively easily.
---
Yeah, no prob. When working, it would be super helpful! I'll check again later today to see if theres more to upvote.
---
We can look this information up.
---
[Draconian Deflector](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12602)
---
[The Immovable Object](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19321)
---
Immovable Object is a decent step up from Draconian and worth the small 80g price. It is practically a side-grade from [Drillborer Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17066) (raid gear), which is the best tanking shield available in the game right now. Drillborer is still slightly better.
---
OP, what race are you? Foror's generally isn't going to make sense for a non-human unless you are willing to pay the money for Edgemaster's. If tanking with Lobotomizer you would benefit heavily from getting yourself a [Muggers Belt](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18505) from DM:North. If you are an Orc there are better options than the Lobotomizer for tanking - i.e. [Frosbite](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19103).
---
But why? If you just want to see a bigger number without actually playing the game, open up calculator do a 1+1, then hit enter.
---
Keep hitting enter, your number will keep getting bigger, hopefully it improves your self worth and fills whatever void you have.
---
I never got the AFKer mentality. Like, why bother trying to "improve" your character if you're not even going to play the game?
---
You can at least like AFK in the boss room or at a GY to make it look like there's more people and deter a rogue from backcapping.
---
Played wow since vanilla never used 2FA never been hacked.  The secret is not to use the email tied to your game accounts for anything other than that.  Most people I know that have been hacked did something stupid like use the email tied to thier wow account to buy gold.

It's just bragging about a joke, some people might find it funny here I guess
---
2 strats: 
---
1) no, don¬¥t go for it right away. farm everything else beside HOJ and SGC until you have decent gear (AV weapon, enough hit, crit etc.). after that do 3 man runs with healer + mage for angerforge/arena runs (20 min. per run). If you get HOJ first go with arena only (probably possible with warri+healer duo). Log out in front of BRD, do 5 runs (15 min.), logout, go watch series, log back in and do this until you have SGC. I put it in the end of my farm cause the BRD chest with 2% crit and 8stam/8strength is relatively good and works for pre-raid bis as well. 
---
2) my friend started running BRD when he was 54 and did nothing else. He leveled to 60 farming angerforge and arena. got it shortly before he hit 60 and then started to farm pre-raid bis in other instances
---
overall... EVERY minor improvement is worth your time investment since your main goal in the game is just to improve, improve, improve. I normally estimate "time investment vs. gain" (example the +4 chest enchant is very expensive I put that almost as last despite having SGC. I used the cheap +3 until I have crusader etc. done). 
---
however when you are at a point where you rarely get improvements its worth farming even minor improvements to fine tune your character.
---
Even I you could, odds are his banks and gold are drained with his gear vendored. He‚Äôd still need to contact Blizz to get his items restored.
---
&gt; Ever played priest before where you have to sit after every other mob
---
I'm 21/30 Holy and farm satyrs far better than this. You have DOTs, AOE fears, and if you really want to learn, you can do some decent DPS with smite.
---
I can pull whole groups of 5, nuke them down, and do another group before needing mana...
---
... in a full raid healing spec.
---
And, if you are in full raid healing spec, Jesus, get some guildies and run for a DPS set. You can have it in about give or six runs.
---
Are we as efficent as a mage? Of course not, it's the best AOE class *in the frigging game*. But to say we can't make money on our own just starts getting to be an excuse.
---
Onyxia only take like 15 min. You could 100% get in a pug. Heck a guild might let you go if you tell them you wouldn‚Äôt want loot, just trying to get that quest done.
---
I keep getting the message ‚Äúyou are not in a party‚Äù constantly while in an AV since the patch. I can‚Äôt figure out which addon is causing it. 
---
Anyone know??
---
Never heard of Asmongold until Classic was coming out so he‚Äôs a 1 for me dawg
---
Those dumb bells are awesome, I have em too. i think they go up to 50/55 lbs each?
---
2FA should be enabled on anything important in your life. It is an extra bit of work but it helps you greatly protect your critical assets. Most systems now a days even has push 2fa where you don‚Äôt even enter codes anymore. Sorry this happened op. Change your email PW, generate longer passwords and use password security programs.
---
I transferred from Stalagg, and it seems more balanced on Heartseeker although alliance heavy
---
... son of a bitch
---
Defense is pretty much flavor text. TIO is superior to DD in all aspects outside of FR.
---
viskag only for human bis.. deathbringer is the holy way of fury
---
every person I've ever known to get hacked got all their stuff back
---
This is how i farmed it for my alt, me a mage can solo the beast so I just do solo the beasts and reset if the orc didnt spawn, and have my friends warr and priest doing the same in another grp, so we had twice the chances per hour.
---
If you have tons of gold you could pay yo mages to farm the arena and get you spawns of garosh.
---
I mean it wasn‚Äôt a legit laugh out loud joke, but gave me a chuckle. No need to gatekeep comedy
---
Because you're taking the time out of your day to defend yourself against a couple of strangers you'll never meet or talk to again :P
---
Multiboxers are scum.
---
Its holiday time, take a break, your account and character s are not going anywhere. Blizz can restore it back just fine.
---
I‚Äôll have to go look into that, thx for the suggestion.
---
&gt;banthok sash
---
dropped that item in my 50 brd arena runs roughly 12 times
---
World PvP in between queues is the way to go.
---
If this persons not raiding they wouldn‚Äôt need the +weapon skill. It would help a bit but there aren‚Äôt a crazy amount of 62s and higher in dungeons. And pvp hit cap is like what 5% (not sure on that)
---
Try Feralas instead or maybe Tanaris until you have a few more levels?
---
LoL
---
It won't accept any of the passwords I'm creating... uppercase, lowercase and numeric. Iv tried everything
---
I mean it wasn‚Äôt a laugh out loud joke, but gave me a chuckle. No need to gatekeep comedy
---
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of...
---
Depends on how good looking and successful you are.
---
Tryna open the gates for you, not close them mate.
---
We could go down the ‚Äúbut how did he take the picture?‚Äù Rabbit holes ;)
---
Big dick heals.
---
In all honesty, mages are better at everything a shaman can do.
---
The statement above doesn‚Äôt matter if you either 1) Love shamans 2) Rather heal than DPS.
---
Yes, you could find a guild that lets you raid as elemental even though it might be hard but you will get annoyed when you run out of mana half way through the boss fight.
---
There are a lot of mages for various reasons which kinda is annoying yet don‚Äôt let the misconception that they are hard to gear them for that reason. Gearing a caster is a pain as it is regardless of class since MOST BIS pieces throughout each phase are all mostly non-set pieces that every shadow priest, warlock, mage and ele shaman will want. 
---
I think shamans are fun and would be my healing class, I just don‚Äôt like healing.
---
Mages are good for casual players since they are self sufficient and not as gear dependent as other classes. With some time and effort, they are a S tier PVE and PvP class.
---
But you get that sweet discounted epic mount with exaulted rep...
---
Still getting over a million honor a week. /shrug
---
This^
---
Downloading the whole thing again because you changed the lua files is gonna be a rip.
---
there is only 1 limit - minimum 10 characters
---
I have the old school authenticator from before the phones were used
---
Looks useful, giving it a try now!
---
Are you AP? If so idk how you‚Äôre going oom
---
The fact that I understand exactly what you mean confirms I reddit too much.
---
That's because AV honor gain rate incentivizes it and us 30+ year olds with jobs and families can't even play enough to get rank 10 with the casual population dropping off and the poopsock neets holding steady.  The Classic honor system is pretty much universally panned but #nochanges.
---
Even in the premades, you get plenty of kills as Alliance - talking 100-200 a day easy.  There's always Horde that freak out and think that 1 mage is going to wipe a 30 member premade group.
---
What the fuck stop making this look like you can‚Äôt do anything in the open world, that‚Äôs just not true man..
---
Yeah and that's why I love it! Such a fun class to play, with all the jump shots and slows and shit like that, love it
---
Nobody believes SGC by itself boosted your dps by 9%
---
Nah, bears can tank BRD fine. In fact, at 60, you can solo significant parts of BRD if properly geared. 
---
Losing a little aggro once in a while, with hyperactive DPS just happens. Any tank experiences that...but with the right gear, it'll happen far less. In particular, in BRD, kill the golem lord until he drops a Naglering for ya. In addition to armor and such, it gives you an additional 3 arcane damage thorns effect. Every little bit of aggro helps, and for large pulls, aggro that applies whenever anyone hits ya is great. 
---
Heal aggro does work. In particularly messy cases(say, someone butt pulls while the group is messed up), a barkskin/tranquility is useful for regaining aggro on everyone. This is generally undesirable if you have aggro already, though. Likewise, Frenzied Regen is a good idea on crazy pulls. 
---
Work Fairy Fire into your rotation. It doesn't eat rage, so it's a good thing to cycle in there with maul when low on rage. Lower armor also allows you to hit harder, so hey, fringe bennies. It's not amazing, but it's something.
---
Honestly you would need a guild's resources to be able to craft it. It would be a huge undertaking to accumulate all that stuff solo.
---
I see you hate fun as well
---
I thought so too, but it's actually amazing. You can dedicate rows/columns to types of items and it looks much nicer, or have visual separators between bags to do the same thing as before.
---
I am curious on what server it is impossible to quest on. Its not August anymore
---
Personally, I see it as cheating. Controlling several characters with one input source. If they were manually swapping between each character, then sure, only one set of inputs for one character at any given time, but controlling all at once with a single keyboard and mouse, cheating all the way.
---
Its hilarious that the Allies are the ones crying about Ally premades.
---
Exactly. Plus this isn't real life and there's nothing from the game that transfers into real life, so I'm not really bringing anyone down in any way that actually matters even a little.
---
I'm a main bear tank. I agree with most of your points, but where you said warriors do more threat. It's well known that bears do more threat than other tanking classes. That's like, all we are good at.
---
Here it is! Alliance complaining about Alliance is somehow Horde fault!!!
---
Looks disgusting hahaha. Oh no your poor eyes can‚Äôt see the background clutter in perfect resolution?
---
Could your eyes even make out that disgusting error message?
---
I don't remember the "storing up" mechanic from vanilla, but lots of mobs will instantly attack up to 5 times if I kite them for a few seconds. Really annoying
---
Not sure what bosses being minutes long has to do with anything
---
Your own fault for not having 2FA.
---
Yeah, for sure. So just to clarify, my comment above was strictly PvE centric.
---
OP is being a bit confusing about what they are trying to get out of their playtime. If trying to rank, discussing shields is pretty moot, as Arms spec with Unstoppable Force is going to be superior style there. If ranking is the goal a respec will be more valuable than any piece gear.
---
I am assuming OP is planning to do tanking things as a basis for this conversation, but you are 100% correct about the pvp hit cap and weapon skill being meaningless if planning to live in BGs.
---
Just cause there is legible words doesn't mean it's not disgusting.
---
Also not screen capping a PC is so pointless.
---
Keep getting angry at stupid things bud. I'm sure whoever is around you on a daily basis loves thst about you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Fucking dummy.

TY
---
As a priest player....
---
*Gigity*
---
That's still 9g profit. Free 9g every single day.
---
You got some for us?
---
I never understood this logic
---
You do realize ther are people who dont sit afk 20min between each game? thats the people you need to compete against :D
---
I'd much rather not have queue than having to fly somewhere to hunt alliance for 20mins between each game
---
I'm going to add this as soon as I get home.  Thank you so much.
---
I have that TSM error when logging in my main but not when logging into my bank alt. Any advice how to fix?
---
Okay, so, here's the thing. In theory, loot council can work out great. And nobody plans to be the guild that loot drama happens in. 
---
Loot drama is still awfully common. 
---
Whatever system you use needs to be reliable. If people think "when x loot drops, I will get" and then that fails to occur, drama is inevitable. If someone has priority, and your council chooses to give it to someone else, people will probably be upset. Depending on the severity of it, it can literally kill guilds.

Right now, with MC/Ony, there's not really a good justification for prioritizing tanks, etc. It just isn't hard to clear. This is somewhat less true later on, but DKP or what not is a remarkably safe choice at present.
---
It is very much similar to the attempt at voice acting the quests.

I haven't downloaded this add-on, I don't know exactly how it sounds but if it voices the dialogue and quests, blizz won't like it as the product isn't in their control (how it looks, sounds...).
---
I top charts in mc and ony.  8/8 t1 with rhok and lhok delar. Hunters are great dps up through bwl
---
Yep! 55 each I believe
---
The people on this sub?
---
Well yeah you have that luxury. Horde can defend their base with 8-10 easily. We need more people to accomplish the same thing horde can do with less. Its just the way the map is designed. 
---
If alliance all go together they will win every time. If horde pick a few off or alliance has too many afk, horde will always win.
---
we straight DKP with very few rules in place and everyone is very happy.
---
The hardcore guys recognize it isn't the best system for progression however, and so we'll likely have a casual and hardcore rg a little down the road.
---
&gt;80% is actually not bad but I guess wouldn't be sufferable for blizzard
---
If you want to use this in any automated process you'd want to be in the very high 90s. I was only surprised I managed to get it above 60-70% due to the very limited data that was available to me (we were not logging enough).
---
&gt;One other thing, did Blizzard actually try to hire some of the people behind private servers or did reach out to them/you? Would have been smart considering all the knowledge and experience they gathered throughout the years.
---
Blizzard are the experts, they have people that worked on classic and they've hired some very good people to work on classic.  They know how to run MMOs. I've talked to a few ex (and current) Blizzard employees that has spoken very briefly on some of their anti cheating initiatives and it sounds to me like they have the necessary tools and people to crack down a lot harder than what they currently are. I can't speak for Blizzard and why they aren't smacking down way harder on cheaters, but I strongly suspect it has something to do with them being careful in their approach. If I were to permanently close someone's account I want to be damn sure I am 110% confident I am doing the right thing. And I think that's what it's about, that missing cherry on the top of the cake, those last few percentages, for me, 98 or 99% was never enough and I'm sure that's the case for Blizzard as well.
---
They are intentionally turtle because they are upset Alliance have Fast Q's with Premades. Since they are too stupid to make their own premade they have decided as a whole to just turtle and try and make alliance hate it.  
---
Angry nerds being angry
---
Not really complaining, just pointing out the comment is slightly misleading because the average player doesn't have the death ray and realistically doesn't stand a chance against someone 20+ levels above them.
---
Genuinely don't understand how people play this game in TYOOL 2019 without an authenticator.
---
For retail players, this has been a given for nearly 10 years.
---
Hell yeah
---
Good point :) I just tried to counter him because he called OP(comment) a liar multiple times with no proper arguments. But I guess I got just as bad.
---
You may not have heard of Bill Murray, that's hard to believe but okay, but that doesnt take away the fact he is far more famous than asmon.
---
That‚Äôs like saying I shouldn‚Äôt equip a helm because I can just buy a cloak on the AH.
---
What does MS&gt;OS mean
---
?
---
Why?
---
what‚Äôs the problem bro
---
1x BRE, a couple of Malistars.
---
We've had terrible luck as a guild. Our 2 druids got 8/8 tier very quickly and our Leaf vs Divinity ration is 50/50 so both our Hunters and Priests are fairly happy. That's the only good luck we've had.
---
Main spec greater than off spec
---
What is turtling?
---
It's part of Asmon's schtick to be made fun of for it. Can't get punished for something that's allowed by that person to begin with.
---
Just submit a ticket and verify that you are the owner of the account. This happened to me except I got phished, which was on me for being so naive ofc, but the hacker changed my email addres, phone number details and everything. The account was virtually non existent.
---
You'll get your stuff back, just file a ticket and verify that the person is you (you might need to submit a scan of your passport ID or any government issued ID). Just do the thing and wait a day or two, you'll get your things restored, dw.

GL man
---
It should at least be an option for pallies. And I say that as someone who never, ever plays a pally, and often plays a mage.
---
Yea but it doesn‚Äôt matter how much Honor you get. And premade can farm 100% more consistent
---
My snowball skills beg to differ
---
&gt;At least bring a wolf and be useful to your team, adding dps to everyone in the group.
---
Unless your raiding group uses world buffs, in which case the Furious Howl from your wolf will actually knock off other much more usefull buffs.
---
arms tanking dungeons is so fun on group pulls. Charge in - bloodrage - sweeping strikes - whirlwind - equip shield + shield block - Cleave (in def stance). The last 2 moves are debateable, but the initial threat is insane with sweeping strikes
---
Back in Cata I got cracked through my 2FA. I don't know how they fucking did it cause the gizmo was exclusively on my phone. Their support was great back then and as soon as I spotted it and made a ticket, they fixed me up within two hours.
---
I threw it off and I haven't had any problems since.
---
wooosh
---
Not gonna lie. The dps checks in raids are not at all hard to reach. If people know how to play their class then they are free to play whatever.
---
And yes, the dps checks scale and increase as we progress through raid tiers however so does our actual dps output. 
---
But if someone wants to play one of the sub optimal specs then they should probably try and play it as best they can to help out with dps checks. A guild on my server raids with several boomkins/ferals, prot paladins and a few of the other sub optimal specs and still clears mc in 1 hour.
---
The big problem people have with these specs is that they are slightly worse in terms of dps. However, the dps isn‚Äôt the biggest thing in terms of having a really fast run. The thing that will most affect the speed of a molten core run with average dps is the looting and pacing of the run (time between pulls and time wasted when distributing loot).
---
If you‚Äôre one of the people who complains about people playing these specs then you are clearly someone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy fun and also cares way too much about the optimal specs.
---
this just in; Chinese reddit influencers trying to downplay chinese gold farming as "dey got xmas spirit."
---
Lend me the gold to get an epic mount then.
---
I lost count of my runs awhile ago. (I'm guessing I'm at around 200 or so now). I keep telling myself I'm going to give up, then I keep trying. So far the only thing it has cost is my sanity. I'll let you know if it was all worth it.
---
ZF/Feralas/maybe first parts of Maraudon. Tanaris if you did not finish it.
---
Lol your post was clearly serious and your woosh is an attempt to make it SEEM like I missed a non existent joke.
---
Read the part where I said I don't think you should have to have an epic mount pal
---
I don't do AFKing in BGs myself, but I do understand the mentality. AV is a shitshow of a BG. Most people just want to either get enough rank to buy some items, or just get exalted and never touch AV again.  
---
  
---
I prefer AB and WSG over AV any day, but playing WSG/AB without the items you can get from AV sucks.
---
Fix it how?  Ban half the horde players?
---
Aurastone and pally prebis are both a lot closer to mageblade than prebis for casters, bigger upgrades &gt; bis
---
Lets assume of the more than 1 million people who played classic that only 1000 have attempted to get this chest piece. 0.7% of 1000 people is 7.
---
7 people will try that long to get the chest piece. Now lets remember a lot more than 1000 people have likely attempted to farm this chest piece. So there are likely a lot more people who are to suffer.
---
Hey that's a...oh
---
I think ret is pretty fun in BG's. Ive played ret since launch. While the dps is indeed lower than top tier classes for raiding, its not nothing. With gear and consumables, you can hit 400-500 dps.
---
For BG's, you basically just need that AV weapon, t2 helm, and fill the other pieces with Lighforge or Valor. I recommend LF, for the mana pool.
---
I think you missed the general point that people don't want this version of AV where solo pulling is possible. They want an earlier version where it wasn't. We're mostly all well aware that this was how the final version of Vanilla AV worked for a few months, then they dropped TBC and scrapped the honor system entirely.
---
Part of the stealth perk. Just how it is.
---
what exactly do you propose as a remedy? there are more horde players, so the queues are longer.
---
Yeah, I don t like fun because I don t want shit specs in my raid. Clearly how fun works. Let s have the Priest tank while at it
---
2 factor authentication. You can download an app on your phone that will generate a code anytime you try to log in to battle.net
---
if you want faster queues, join alliance
---
There are too many horde players. That is the problem.
---
Is there an addon that lets me create more macros? I am running our of macro slots on my druid at an alarming rate.
---
Uhhh I did? You say "mount isn't important" then right after that you contradict yourself by saying it's a dick move. So is it important or not? Clearly you believe it is... 
---
And no, wow does not affect you in real life. NOTHING you do in this game will EVER matter in real life unless we're talking about meeting your gf in game or something. But do you really wanna date a chick who only rides with you for the 100% speed increase?
---
Ez mode during world pvp without bg's, now you want them to fix the queues? Maybe you should re-roll alliance.
---
Hunter is a great class.  My skill level is average, and I have been able to obtain decent blue level gear with a few epics (thanks to my casual-friendly raid guild).  If I am in a pug group, I am almost always #1 on damage, especially if it's a longer boss fight.  
---
PvP is great too.  The dead zone you referenced is annoying, but if you play strategically you can be very effective in PvP.  I think people put too much emphasis on "what is good in PvP" because in battlegrounds it usually comes down to knowing how to play your class strategically.  In classic, there are some PvP fights that you're never going to win (regardless of class).  On a hunter, if that warrior charges in and gets his hamstring off (and your feign death/trap is on cooldown), there's not a lot left for you to do besides flop over.  That's just the way it goes and that's okay.  When you respawn you get the drop on the warrior at max range, plant your trap before engaging queue up an aimed shot before he even see's you.
---
You probably didnt level an alt lately, 50+ zone still sucks since you never see any ally
---
Yeah, it was a bit of hyperbole.
---
Still, I think most people would give up way before doing 500+ runs, I know I did. So if we only count the people who had the willpower to sit through 500+ runs without a drop, I think the number would be very small.
---
If that's the only upgrade you can get outside from raids, I don't see any reason why not to.
---
No idea sorry
---
I think, in terms of efficiency, it‚Äôs the best loot system there is.
---
"no changes" is dead because of all the changes made already, not because it backfired
---
That¬¥s why i use Elvui. Comes with most addons one needs for a complete ui change and after setting one character the others is just use main character profile.
---
Only needed to get details and dbm and leatrix besides Elvui.
---
Not sure of the acronym. But they‚Äôre talking about the Authenticator.
---
Ya there are no shortcuts to being good and farming the proper gear is part of that.
---
People on 60s should hang left if they realllllly want to do AV, the only way you‚Äôre not going to die to the horde gank is if you‚Äôre not where they‚Äôre looking.
---
Why do you keep thinking I‚Äôm heated. I‚Äôm stoned of my balls laughing my ass off thinking about some npc reading my post history hunting for argument ammo hahaha.
---
Turn on your local Top 40 music station. Tell me how many operas and symphonies you hear being played vs how many hip hop, jazz, and rock songs being played. Hint: If you think Elvis and the Beatles and everything that followed are 'white music' you haven't studied music history.
---
AB is the one true BG.
---
* AV devolves too often into a zerg rush with little actual PvP
---
* WSG is just bland. It's CTF, hooray, it was overdone and boring 15 years ago when it first came out.
---
But AB, yes it's control points. It's been done a lot. But it has strategy. Mages slowfalling people to jump from LM to BS, deciding if you want to cross the water or risk the bridges, actual fights because 15 is enough whre it feels like a battle but you're not lost in the zerg.
---
But even so, if you just want to AFK, why bother playing? At least be somewhat productive and AFK at base acting as a body to deter rogues. You know be marginally useful, it takes 30 seconds to run to your base from original spawn.
---
I think you're missing the point where the solo pulling was most definitely possible in every AV version in Vanilla. Unless of course, you can provide evidence that it wasn't just like I provided evidence that it was.
---
Because a dead Hunter doesn't do any damage.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äòelitism‚Äô; Alliance is either on a 100% mount, or they get murdered passing Belinda and are useless to the main strat.  This isn‚Äôt about being slightly suboptimal, it‚Äôs a pretty strict gate of being useful or not.
---
The joke is it's ridiculous to blame Horde for something that has absolutely nothing to do with the Horde at all. Alliance making premades and screwing over Alliance PUGs is objectively, solely, the fault of Alliance.
---
It's a joke because of course some moron tries to make this argument anyway.
---
AllyRoute along with this helps downtime. Helps you not lose time running around and having to go back where you just were. Sometimes it‚Äôs a little ahead of where you should be, but the other 90% is on point.
---
If true, I didn‚Äôt notice. I found that if I clicked off the ravager buff right after it hit the mob, it would almost give an extra attack. Which if that proc‚Äôd WF, it would be pretty huge. Honestly was too annoying for me.
---
That‚Äôs an insult to the hat
---
It has EVERYTHING to do with the horde! If the horde didn't absolutely massively outnumber the alliance, the alliance wouldn't be capable of abusing the premade system.
---
Carrying this conversation. Attempting to slap a title on somebody, all based in negativity. Seems pretty heated to me you fucking fummy.
---
Probably should smoke and comment my dude. Your post history..and this thread makes you seem like a supreme asshole.
---
Hope your mother hugs you tonight. You need dome time out of the basement.
---
True.
---
But if not in a min/max guild, BM Can still do respectable dmg. Plus you don‚Äôt have to respec every raid if you like to farm as BM üòù
---
Try reserving either the Dal‚ÄôRend mainhand or shield.
---
If you make and tank the group you should have the leverage to do that!
---
there was no AFK report system in vanilla
---
You compensate people who are willing to be put on last in line by putting them first on high value gear from future raids or whatever. If you‚Äôre first in line for one piece of loot, you‚Äôll be fairly placed as last in line on other pieces. For example maybe a Mage gets last on Mage Blade but then gets first on Choker from Ragnaros. Or a rogue gets last on Viskag but gets first on Drake Talon Talisman in BWL.
---
Does black lotus ever despawn if it's not picked?
---
Like for shits and gigs while playing I took a quick wander into Tyr's Hand in EPL and because I could stealth on my druid I just took a quick look at the lotus spawns there. Lo-and-behold there was one at the very back of the area requiring you to kill two trying elites to pick it if you can stealth to the back there or murder your way through. 
---
I had a guildy who was with me questing in EPL suicide pull them away so I could pick it and I paid him more than enough for his repairs and a bit more cause they sell for 50g on my server.
---
I don't see that one ever being reliably picked by spawn point campers.
---
Dude you're only 41... reroll.
---
Oooo what add-on is your nameplate?
---
You pay your subscription just like me man, you're allowed to do whatever the fuck you want in this game and I can't stop you. I believe you should absolutely have the right to solo queue av on a 10% donkey and go kill harpies for 10 hours. You should have the right, cause you pay the same money as me. Does this make you a dick? Yeah, yeah it fuckin does holy shit.
---
WoW absolutely affects my real life and you've come to the wrong place on the internet if that's the hill you're gonna die on. I have multiple family members involved with the game, multiple lifelong irl friends who I see over the holidays. The game makes me happy which translates into real life. Your shit must be super sad if you can't see how that's possible :(  anyways happy holidays u bear-poking cunt
---
Imagine talking shit about someone‚Äôs skill level then acting like the reward from overwhelming odds is ‚Äòraid tier rewards‚Äô.  It‚Äôs useful for no one but the casuals who do normal and nothing else.
---
They aren‚Äôt at all shit specs, they just aren‚Äôt the best. And yes, you clearly don‚Äôt like fun because you are constantly worrying about how fast/slow the run is instead of just finding somewhere that you can have a laugh in while raiding. 
---
And making a priest tank? That‚Äôs just unreasonable. I‚Äôm not saying to take people for roles they don‚Äôt fill, I‚Äôm just saying that something being sub optimal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúshit‚Äù and shouldn‚Äôt be played.
---
I do the same for Skyrim and a few others.  I guess I still like the lore and the universe, so it‚Äôs fun to see people still enjoying what I once did.

---
I really don't know; I don't think them not being picked is an issue, normally. But can't rule it out, as I've not heard of it before.
---
Blizzard intentionally removed the core functionality that this macro relied upon. It was a bug that they forgot to remove it during Classic beta, as it's a TBC+ feature.
---
Go farm gold instead of being a slug in av.
---
2 factor authentication can be any number of systems.  Text message, key fob code generator (Toopher, RSA), USB keygen (Yubikey), Google Authenticator, Steam Authenticator are just examples of 2FA.
---
Keep in mind you're literally asking the sub of dedicated classic WOW players how they feel.  Anyone who lost interest or is not deep into it is not going to be here so you're getting a major self selection bias.
---
Use them ASAP to get CDs running. TBH as others have said it shouldnt be needed in MC on most fights as they don't last long enough. You should try to never use evocate unless out of other options
---
This is if you want to be as efficient as possible, obviously some raids will be fine with you playing less optimally to save money on consumes, talk to your class/raid leader about it
---
Nice
---
Then I bet a cure for autism would make you jump of joy! Then those silly hang ups would stop be a issue altogether.
---
They are premades. Like minded people playing together. You are free to join/make 60% mount premades or use the queue.
---
Premades are a problem for alliance in AVs currently.  You have many AVs now where it is 16-20 Alliance vs 40 Horde for the first few minutes.  Which leads the Alliance to wipe at the start and be relatively clueless as to what to do next as their side slowly fills.
---
If it continues I could see Blizzard stepping in with some sort of remedy.  Like giving people who don‚Äôt join a BG they are queued for the deserter rebuff.  If they wanted you to be able to do premades they would allow you to queue as a group.
---
Plus the situation creates a real haves vs have nots in regards to chasing honor ranks.  Easy honor for the premades and not so much for everyone else.  It‚Äôs just easier now than it was 15 years ago to do premades.  Discord is just so much better than what was used back then for communication.
---
Did he quit Classic?
---
They‚Äôve made a lot of changes
---
Leashing mechanics protecting cities
---
Black Lotus spawn timer
---
Devilsaur spawn timer (lol)
---
Guard behavior
---
And I‚Äôm sure more
---
Small changes like not showing AV numbers so premade a cant know if they‚Äôre in a good game or bad would go a long way to improve the experience for everyone and make wsg more viable. You could also make it so AVs are created every 10 or 15 seconds and mix up  everyone who queued during that time so counting down on discord is significantly less effective without increasing queue times
---
It‚Äôs actually fairly terrible.  Fight lengths being so short make +healing really the only stat you want.  Attribute stats are gained in plenty from other gear. Rosewine and Fordrings are clearly what you want.  I can see the emerald being an ok pick for pvp though.

How much mana you have?

Maul is still really good threat. Swipe is definitely also useful, but there are definitely times, even when aoe tanking, when maul should be prioritized.

Fortunately, different CDs, so you can do both if you have the rage.

I think yes shared the wrong link

Well that's pointless.

No. No. This scuffed ass brick wall conversation is the last thing affecting my real life my dude. You have 0 perspective whatsoever if you think you, an internet stranger, can determine what is and isn't important to my virtual life or my real life. You have literally 0 idea who I am, nor I you. You say you met your gf over wow, that's cool man I'm happy for you. My older brother and I saved our relationship through this game. Its important to me

What's with the circlejerk of hating asmongold on this sub? Jesus that's a lot of hate for someone they never met, especially someone who wears a persona.
---
Pot/gem whenever it will top you off and you‚Äôre not having downtime.  Evo later if you think your mana isn‚Äôt going to make it to the end of the fight and you have a moment to stand still and channel.
---
Its not really that complicated, the only rules is that pots can probably be used a couple times during a boss fight and evo can‚Äôt, so only use evo when pots are on cd.

Charatcer can be restored manually, and gear too. The 10k gold will require some help from blizz tho

Cool, fury warriors can do a lot of damage. I still don‚Äôt see how it makes much difference. If the damage your members do matters so much to you even though you‚Äôre clearing content then that‚Äôs just shit in the first place.

There's at least one easy farm that shaman have the lock down on, but otherwise I make all my money from herbalism, alchemy, and fishing, and boy is it easy money.
---
It‚Äôs a real problem that I hope Blizzard addresses soon.  Complain about pugs all you want and rightfully so.  The sheer number of people doing premades is significantly harming the experience of those who aren‚Äôt.
---
Nah.
---
Never have, never will.
---
If the tank is self healing in MC/Ony, what are the healers doing? Bears can tank either just fine. 
---
Warden Staff is not bad, but I honestly suggest just doing tribute runs until you get the hammer. It's very nearly as good, and better if you use elemental sharpening stones.
---

2 man the arena with a healer, don't group.
---
You should check out the addon Adibags. It gives autosort sections for you like consumables, reagents, jewelry, armor etc... you can also manually assign a new section titled PVP and put all your pvp items and trinkets in there for easy switching.
---
If you like to complain about everything at all times, choose alliance. Otherwise, horde is pretty alright.
---
What would be the primary stats for an hybrid resto-ele shaman? Also, what's the gear preference?
---
Well for a while in the day early enough you could farm 6 minute wins

I have also seen weird layering stuff on Zandalar Tribe EU.

&gt; First boss drop, just need to coordinate 3 tanks and 6 interrupts and that fight is on farm status.

I mean that really isn't THAT much to ask for in a 40 man raid right?

How does dungeon loot range work?
---
Yesterday I found a hunter doing tribute runs because I want a drop off of Gordok. 
---
I joined him and ended up dying in the halls, he pulled and killed Gordok, but I was too far away for the drop.
---
He passed so the item is still on the body, and I released and stealthed through again, this time making it all the way to Gordok. However I couldn't loot his body.
---
So 2 questions 1. Why couldn't I see the roll on the kill, did I need to be in the same room? And 2. Why couldn't I loot him once I made it to the boss on my 2nd try?
---
MCP is not required for anything, it's basically a consumable for certain fights. Not necessary, but nice to have. 
---
It's also very easy to farm, and can be farmed solo even while leveling. It's very fast and easy. You can do a run in roughly 5 minutes.
---
I am a Tauren.
---
Small advice from a mage bro to a mage bro, you don't need to bind each gem to a keybind you can just use 1 keybind for all gems - uses the best one if available then the next one if it isn't and so on :) means you get to use the keybinds for other things etc.

Are servers more casual than others? I have the impression my server is mostly competitive / hardcore and find myself feeling ostracized by the general progression of players.
---
Nope, I only mentioned engineering.  You don't need it.
---
Warriors usually have inferior threat. Druids scale well with threat, because they get a flat multiplier. As stats increase, their overall threat scales accordingly. 
---
Druids also have a fairly easy time getting high hp values. They get a nice batch from bear form, and a bonus multiplier from talents. This contributes to making them easy to heal.
---
People feel superior by disliking him, but he‚Äôs literally the biggest troll on Twitch and he‚Äôs one of the few that makes massive amounts of money from his haters, so he doesn‚Äôt need to give a damn.

Sounds like average classic quests.

&gt; People nowadays seem to have minmax OCD. If there's a way to do something 5% more effective, but 90% less fun, they will go for it.
---
Welcome to reality, WOW is no longer World of Noobcraft.  Everyone has played MMOs before and so they behave accordingly.  You can change the content back to how it was but you can't remove the experiences of the players.  That sense of being lost, that sense of wonder, that sense of MMOs being a new thing because 95% of WOW players had never played an MMO before, you'll never get those back any more than you can ever experience what it was like to fall in love for the first time again.
---
For better or worse, the playerbase is irrevocably changed and will never be the same.  Unless we get some really crazy shit like straight up Sword Art Online VR then it's going to stay that way too.
---
Just quest. I got to 60 in 4 days and 14 hours on my hunter and never grouped up once.
---
No idea about geographical differences, but the vast majority of complaint posts I have come across are from an Alliance perspective. Take that as you will.
---
It depends on what you want. The bulk of the rep gain occurs within the first 10 minutes or so. So if you're looking to farm rep, you want to zerg-and-repeat.
---
However, honor gains are relatively constant throughout AV. So if you want honor as Horde, you turtle and drag the match out as long as possible to avoid the queue delay.
---
The totem bar addon makes a huge difference.  I went from no room for skills to empty space on my bars.
---
Because we allowed even the non premades free roam south while we hard short ques now they are lost.
---
Ah ok, that's not as bad as I was expecting
---
Got one from Azuregos last night, still no idea how much it sells for given current water prices.
---
*laughs in 3 AddOns*
---
A casual player might be able to get the items for legendary weapons from pugs... but good luck wining the item/items. Not only will you have to be lucky enough for it to drop but will have to be lucky enough to win the roll. Then the grind to get all the crafting mats. 
---
If you want a legendary you should really join a guild.
---
I guess I was drawing parallels between bots and people who mindlessly stand at the entrance of a dungeon while someone gathers XP for them. It‚Äôs like people who want to be handed an ‚ÄúI win‚Äù button, press it, and win the game - where‚Äôs the gameplay?
---
Queue dodge shouy be punishable with deserter debuff or shorter cd before you can requeue
---
10 min games are good for everyone . 20-25 min games are good for the horde. 40+ min games are bad for everyone.
---
Very nice!
---
It will maybe change over time? If they keep loosing they change up strategy I suspect. Was same when original wow came out after it changed from 3h battles
---
What if, and hear me out on this, what if you have both the arena trinket AND buy that mana pot?
---
Oof... Thanks for telling me otherwise I wouldn't have noticed.
---
Botters are cancer, but they're cancer because they're bad for the economy. Just straight up allowing gold sales does the same thing, but more. In Eve Online, sure, it's okay, but it's generally inflationary.
---
Y pvp system wasn't like this in vanilla for starters
---
I just keep seeing people say they seen a post stating that but I haven't been able to find it yet
---
Gorak deserves nice tree :D Great video man! I chose green gift, poor Gorak! as always haha
---
Reduced the spawn timer when layering was removed then again a month or two later
---
Well, but not inviting hybrids out of fear for your loot seems quite obsessive.... don't really want to be doing that.
---
Plus I guess i assumed main before off is a given for every pug.
---
do we know the dps difference between these two chests?
---
Man I didn't get hoj till they day before my first raid. Like 2 months of farming it and had only seen it drop once. Ended up getting it when I could solo anger
---
Right, I think he's asking why haven't they adapted yet like horde did.
---
lol you say I don't affect you then go on some tough guy rank yet... you're still replying so you clearly care :P
---
* arcante is pmuch always 4-5g I dunno what server you are on for it to be 8
---
* arcanite cd is 48
---
* finding a buyer &gt; meeting up &gt; doing the trade etc is probably 10-15 minutes, meanwhile the undeath water is 30 second click.
---
the last point is really underrated over 200 transmutes doing arcanite kinda suck
---
Any cross realm premade groups for AV that want another mage to join? (:
---
l2sayjokedumbass
---
I'm at 220ish runs for HoJ so I feel your pain. Not anything close to 500 like some of the posters claim for SGC.
---
You have 2 dal rends main hands?!?!??!!??!!??!!??
---
Mostly because he's a huge asshole hypocrite, and partially because we're jealous that a massive asshole hypocrite is getting rich off of children who think it's cool to be an asshole.
---
go to balinda and be annoying to the horde there until you die. it won't take long 
---
then don't res, but run as ghost south to frostwolf graveyard (or relief hut if that was tagged first) 
---
wait there for the gy to cap. grab a drink and a snack. 
---
res when it's up and go join the boys at drek
---
feel free to eat my nuts as i charge by at 60%! lolol /violin
---
It creates incentive to farm more gold, so in a way in indirectly does inject more money into the economy than would be there without the tokens.
---
Do people actually file lawsuits against MMO companies over bans? So what happens then, Blizzard gives you your $15 back for that month? Oh no.
---
I don't think Blizzard lives in fear of me doing this.
---
not a boomer. you are a trash of a human being.
---
I don't get super pissed over loot any more. At the same time I also don't get super excited when I get loot either. 
---
Having several hunters take a dal rend from my rogue because "iTs bIs bRo," having holy pallies roll on a HOJ and other loot fuckery changes a man.
---
Put it in the bank...?
---
Ya for horde it‚Äôs not possible to time it with the 20 min wait it‚Äôs viable for ally only
---
As Horde, we had the exact problem in TBC. Instant queues for AV, but it was called AFK Valley. It was worth more to lose in 5-6 minutes and requeue. We'd get more marks of honor than alliance because they had ~1hr queue.
---
Dude what? First of all I saw nothing with your post. It was more banter than anything. I was talking about people commenting with hate here. Second of all, dude what lmao
---
Always roll need on BoE epics. Always roll need on Flasks. Always roll need on everything over 100g unless the group has agreed to other rules. 
---
The other people are in the wrong for rolling greed.
---
You provided evidence that solo pulls were possible at some time and that they addressed it. That is not at all proof that it was always possible, particularly since we know for a fact that AV was changed drastically in Vanilla.
---
Can confirm personally, you get an error message saying you can't buy your own auctions. The only way is to have a friend do it for you, or get a second account.
---
when you have like 12 addons you will want the app to make sure everything is updated.
---
Can't even find an EU premade discord, only the NA one..
---
Not really. Common etiquette is always Need valuable BoEs.
---
Same here, though for me it was my Dwarf hunter. Really wanted that Night Elf mount so had to start the rep grind early!
---
DKP is set to fail if your guild isn‚Äôt hardcore. There‚Äôs always someone who dumps all their dkp and then goes into the hole too fast. Hoarding and using decay pisses people off. If you‚Äôre going to do that system you‚Äôre better off using Suicide Kings. At the least the ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù (roll position) is finite across the board.
---
It‚Äôs funny bc a lot of horse still don‚Äôt understand how to stop this strategy. I lost 4 AVs in a row the other day as horde.
---
On my server, essence of earth is 1g less than essence of water, which makes it less profit than arcanite transmute which is like 2-3g per day.
---
Cat contributes more towards raid DPS than wolf does with howl. 0 reason to use a wolf, especially when Howl can push off world buffs because of the buff cap.
---
You mentioned a streamer. Im sure this comment section will be civil!
---
The ridiculous hours spent farming Timbermaw could be spent doing something else though unless the alchemist is also an enchanter or the person really wanted the npc summon item. I bought the water transmute and use it daily. I should break even and begin printing money after 90 transmutes which isn‚Äôt bad. I bought the recipe for 570g and make around 10g profit per xmute. 
---
It‚Äôs absolutely not worth it IMO if the recipe is more than 600-700g and even then only worth it if the player logs in to use it every day
---
Thinking about rolling a Druid, It would be fun to tank some 5 mans, nothing more serious. Torn between Nelf and Tauren, wich race would make a better tank? üòä
---
Classic WoW has a lot of older players.  Older people have a hard time understanding the appeal of streamers, or why they make so much money.  It really angers them.
---
stop saying you just did and show logs. and no one piece upgrade isnt giving you 9% dps increase
---
Efficient in what manor?
---
Need/Greed peaks efficiancy for me. You dont even need to type anything to roll... just click a button.
---
The male elves are very accurate
---
I farmed it IN AV. LOL sucka
---
Well then you should use AdiBags. Automatically sorts your inventory into categories, and it's all customizable.
---
Also, if you were using Bagnon, you don't have to use the "one-bag" option, you can still have it show each individual bag while you retain all the other benefits of the addon.
---
Think hes just taking a break from streaming and has been playing PoE.  I saw him in AV the other day so he's still around.
---
&gt;Horde can defend their base with 8-10 easily.
---
against a premade? wrong.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cmwov/hey_reddit_what_tattoos_do_you_have/c0tpyls
---
R8 is roughly on par with Tombstone Breastplate.
---
i wouldn‚Äôt even do that!
---
ive gotten my account hacked and back in wotlk. only got 70% of the stuff back. (mostly lost gold and mats)
---
think mostly you will retain your gear.
---
That definitely makes sense. Especially with SSD‚Äôs. You can probably get out and in of WoW in no time. 
---
I have a ton of addons as well but the only ones that affect my visuals are Shadowed UF/ Details.
---
6-700g tops. Any more than that and it isn‚Äôt really worth buying. you could sell it in trade chat to avoid the AH 5% cut. 
---
The people trying to sell this recipe for 1000g don‚Äôt realize that it will take like 7-8 months of daily transmutes to break even and start making profit and that doesn‚Äôt count lost value from spending the money on other items that will increase in value like black lotus
---
Choose the faction you like most. Alliance or horde is a much bigger decision than racials.
---
Hey thanks! I was hoping the text would turn out a little more clear but oh well. It was hard not to make it a more powerful item.
---
You're doing it right.
---
I guess, idk. I'm an older player myself and I don't mind streamers. Like it or don't, watch it or don't. But this amount of hate and circlejerk is pretty impressive.
---
How did you rank up 3 characters so high??? I'm just trying to get 1 character to rank 10.
---
This sort of mentality just compounds the problem.  While I could join a premade as well it‚Äôs just making the situation for those who don‚Äôt worse and worse.  Horde have non 60s and level 60s with 60% mounts.  
---
I try not to complain about people who are actually trying.  If people are fishing, killing harpies or afk I would love to see them get banned, but trying while being under geared I don‚Äôt have a problem with.  Though I would make it level 60 only if I could.
---
While I don‚Äôt blame people for operating within the rules the rules should be changed.  We would all be better off without premades at this point because the people you are competing with for honor ranks are using them also. 
---
I have guildies who are having to get the carrot and screen shot that they have all the mount speed bonuses to get in a premade.  You know because having that 3% bonus is more meaningful than the harder to measure other factors.  I say this even though I have all those bonuses and a 100% mount.  The whole thing is stupid.
---
This so many people think they have to out threat on the skull in trash packs. They just have to force it to attack them through Fixates and stuns (taunt mocking blow etc). I think preach talks about it in one of his old videos but its mainly about wasted threat, does you no good to keep mauling/sundering a mob that will die and no one can over take your threat. Now this applies with the gear and knowledge most people have to blast a skull down, you can Charge&gt;AA&gt;taunt then bash when the 3 sec fixate from taunt falls off it and it will die so any maul threat you generate on the mob is wasted and would be better spent on the other mobs in the pack so the healer/cleave dps do not take threat from you.
---
Potions and dark/demonic runes first (before mana gems) to get the CDs rolling on the fight where you know you‚Äôll need to use all your mana consumes. For simpler fights where you can afford it, just use the mana gems. 
---
I‚Äôm saying this as a non mage with the understanding that the gems are one time use during a fight each and not worth the mana to cast and make more during fights
---
This just in; dude thinks chinese gold farmers want to bring attention to themselves.
---
I played on Light's Hope, and this summary is generally accurate. A private server with a good admin team works.
---
Some of us are in mediocre guilds on bad RP servers. I think 2 guilds have downed Rag on my server.
---
One thing people rarely mention and if they do they fail to explain:
---
Never reuse passwords for any accounts you care about. What can happen is an account is setup with a company that has shitty security so inevitably their password database gets breached and published online. People grab said database and start trying other services with those same details. There have been several high profile cases of this type of breach happening to large companies.
---
I had my account breached once and it was when I had removed my authenticator and was too lazy to reinstate it and was also recycling passwords.
---
For anyone that thinks their WOW account password was ever brute forced: No it wasn't, you either reused a password , got phished or got keylogged.
---
Honestly, the racials between the two druid's are negligible from a performance standpoint. If you really like the Tauren warstomp it's ok in 5 mans when tanking trash packs. I am personally playing a nelf since my cohorts are on Alli. But either way Druid's are boss tanks in 5  mans once you have some +hit and attack power for threat.
---
I mean let's be honest you're probably going to lose anyways if you had full group at the start of the battleground unless a good chunk of it was a premade.
---
No life
---
Works fine, it's a macro functionality so it will work with any bar mod. I personally use it with bartender.
---
Everyone is saying to use 2FA don‚Äôt forget to use it on your Email accounts too!! Almost every main email service provider has a 2FA system in place. This will make it almost impossible for any hacker to reset your passwords on anything in the future! Good luck getting everything restored dude!
---
It gives 180 mana, 198 as disc spec, with the extra spirit added it gets bumped up to 215ish throughout a fight.  Rank 3 heal is 217 mana iirc.
---
This is helpful, thank you.
---
Obviously it's all luck and shit, but, I grinded Scholo for items and then Argent Dawn exalted and saw 3 or 4 Cadaverous armours, only. And you need a full group to farm for those Cadaverous, where multiple people are going to want it (lost the first Cadaverous to a fury), whereas you can farm for SGC with a healer and yourself.
---
I prefer felhunter most succubus drainers turn off her abilities to dark fact her mana imo might as well use the daemon who has no auto cast abilities and that way fel infused blood weakens foes and you have purges and silences on demand plus more mana than the succubus.
---
It‚Äôs not good for many raid fights but it‚Äôs still very useful. Switch off when it‚Äôs on CD. Calling it trash because you don‚Äôt know how to use it effectively is laughable
---
One of our OG rogues just got it on Monday :D
---
I play a priest and even I think that sword is sexxxy.
---
You forgot to calculate lost opportunity cost as well as difference in cost compared to other transmutes. Everyone can make a fire to earth transmute which should net you about 3-5g per day depending on server. If it doesnt the earth to water becomes useful.
---
Timbermaw rep farming yields massive amounts of gold. I made roughly 30g per hour while farming timbermaw rep. Especially with current AV queues it becomes a good way to use your time to wait for the next BG.
---
I don't think so. I am aware that it's BIS until AQ40/phase 5; however, you can make a very close compromise with having the 2 blue PVP pieces (chest/leg) at rank 8 and then slap on the Drake Talon Pauldrons from BWL which should come out soon. Grinding to rank 8 can be as bad as grinding arena's but if you are also grinding for AV rep, you're kind of killing 2 birds with 1 stone.
---
So ask yourself if you're willing to do PVP.
---
lmao admire the dedication brother. due to circumstances beyond my control i play on a 6 year old macbook air so im going to guess that yes this thing could handle it. this is basically a 15 year old game after all, computer technology has improved drastically in that timeframe. this machine would have been good-great when this game was released.
---
yeah, it‚Äôs garbage. the MC gear is better for pvp. druid set is similar (but the set bonus is good)
---
I have played it for longer than I would like to admit. 
---
I still enjoy the casual discussions and sometimes there are memes/videos that are just too hilarious to pass on.
---
Plus sometimes people surprise me with some trick I have never thought of.
---
We run raid #2 with 5 healers, so mages are spamming Ice Barrier and it's not unusual to run low on mana. It's not unusual for guilds to be running MC with 25-30 people, either, which makes the fights a lot longer.
---
32.33 like do you even meme
---
I'm not even going to touch the Premade issue and it's a different matter entirely.
---
I think it's hilarious that you say it's just a game yet are fighting so adamantly with someone on how it's just a game. If it were the case, you wouldn't care how others feel towards the game, meaning you have some personal invested interest in this content. 
---
It's not any different from someone enjoying a sport. Do they have to make money, make a sport teams or content, or stream it for it to be a part of their lives? Do they need to actually play it to be a part of the community that encompasses it? Are we banned from being invested in games because we don't fulfill your criteria of what shall and shall not be a part of our lives?
---
You found your GF on it as well. "It's just game" translated a game experience into a real life one for you, did it not? Are you going to give a delusional explanation on how these words aren't the case? I also met my GF in a MMO, and I treat games like I do as a hobby or family activities, varying from game to game. Families play games together, friends play games together. It's akin to hanging out and spending time together, and even if you dont see it as such. 
---
The other person, in my opinion, is just trying to state that the game is important to them, his family, and his friends.
---
People only in there for rep are few now. This mentality is also why premades are a thing, you dont have those that are just concerned with rep in the game
---
If I was in your position, I'd buy up all of the cheap arcane crystals I could find (like the ones on buyout for less than 45g and get them transmuted by desperate alchemists trying to burn their CD.   I've seen people selling arcanite transmute for 4g regularly, and I'm sure you could give some of them 3.  Anyways, buy those up and hold on to them until phase 3 as others are saying here.  Keep track of how many you buy for how much, I bet you can turn 1000g into 1500 pretty easily - and arcanite is a pretty steady market.
---
Yeah, those thing start to matter at very high level. But for 5 mans you don't need to worry about it. Play the faction you want. Bears are great tank in both.
---
So happy! Especially because our raid group has 10 fury warriors and 6 rogues lol
---
Just curious what do you tip for a full trade window of mage water?
---
Depends on your server, if you have never seen it before on the AH then just set it to a higher price and drop it regularly until it sells.
---
High priced BoE drops should always be need rolled. I will usually try to spam this out in /yell if something drops.
---
HOWEVER, if let‚Äôs a high priced BOE drops and multiple people greed, I will wait until the last second to see if everyone greeds and greed myself.
---
Everyone should need roll though.
---
Strongly recommend the demonic runes.  Dead easy to farm up a stack of them and using it when it will top you to full in a longer fight first is probably when healers have enough mana to top you up too.
---
on a min-max level sure, but it's really not too big of a deal for 99% of players. i play horde (mage) and druid tanks are honestly my preferred 5-man tanks just because theyre so good at aoe threat generation.
---
I popped this during a low damage part in Ony. Get 3 ticks suddenly I'm dispelled.
---
Stone Cold Gold
---
Consistent Andy
---
DM Tribute and Princess runs (for the Blackstone Ring) are definitely on my to-do list.
---
However, as I built my own Bis target list by compiling information off a couple Internet BiS lists and hunter guides, I had no idea Ogre Forged Hauberk existed, so thanks for pointing that out :) legs are nice as well.
---
Yes it would I want fucking long ass crazy matches and bliz should grant additional honor for battles that you stay in for more than an hour and then bonus honor if you win.
---
Does Blizzard still sell the USB authenticator for 2FA? I'm looking for an option that doesn't require a phone.
---
Thanks so much for this! Im dyslexic and this will help alot
---
Then add the +40 attack power for set bonus
---
Ohhhh that‚Äôs right your scummy alliance warriors like swords more than axes, for us it‚Äôs totally rogue prio. 
---
Even more gratz :D
---
makes sense i guess
---
As others have said: it's not you, it's the DPS.
---
There's lots of good advice in the topic, but sometimes it won't matter how good you are. There are going to be DPS who are just going to faceroll their keyboard and care more about their big dick DPS than anything else.
---
Hunters are gonna multi shot and steal your aggro at the start of a fight. Shadow priests are gonna mindblast every chance they get and steal aggro. Mages are gonna open with all their AOE and spam blizzard before you hit for a second time. A lot of the time there is nothing you can do about it except try to talk to them or know how to deal with it. 
---
Marking mobs is probably #1 for dealing with it, if they follow marks anyway. You can know which mob is gonna need taunted a couple seconds into the fight. I run with a shadowpriest in my guild regularly and he constantly pulls aggro and I've just learned when I need to taunt to maintain my aggro.
---
Personally, I've found tanking gets a lot easier once you realize that it won't matter if you do everything right, you can still lose aggro if the group works against you.
---
All my rolls on items I do want are never higher then 40
---
Last time someone did an addon that read the quests they got a cease and desist from Blizzard.
---
Yea all the tryhard fury warriors are human so they get prio :(
---
Yeah I run with my guildies to avoid situations like this. But most the people that are assholes on my server are usually just in a couple of guilds that I avoid so its alot easier to avoid.
---
Can't say they don't deserve the ques lol. They made their bed when mass rolling Horde xD.
---
Is there a way to enable 2fa without a phone? You used to be able to buy a dongle from the Blizz store.
---
As people have said, outside of the premades, Alliance is garbage. Occasionally a random queue will get you into a game with a premade and then we think that zerging is the only strategy to win because it worked. So when we get into full pugs, we try to force that strategy not realizing its not possible when majority of players are AFK farming, 60% mounts, and non geared. Now AV pugs on alliance side have become nothing but complaining about how "unfair the game is" or that "we shouldnt be defending, everyone come south." AV is an objective based game that can only be zerged if everyone is on the same page with geared tanks/healers (usually only found in premades). If you join a full pug, assume you cant zerg and complete the objectives (kill galv and lts, cap towers, recap bunkers and gys, drive the horde back from DB, etc.). You'll get more honor and rep by doing so and make killing Drek easier. Dont expect 8-10 minute games unless you're with a premade.
---
Hah! Momos. Haven't heard that insult in years!
---
Threat mechanics are largely irrelevant to you if you don't want to go beyond 5 mans. Try not to overthink it and play what you will like the most.
---
Try to understand the 'why' behind what the guide is saying rather than taking it as gospel. Horde raid tanking is generally seen as more challenging threat-wise due to the lack of Blessing of Salvation on DPS. However, Horde DPS and Tanks both benefit from Windfury.
---
I am not sure what it is about wow classic but I get significantly more loot rage than when I play retail.
---
I put the numbers in there. 570g, 10g profit a day, 90 day break even approximately. Profits vary by server price ofc. And i do the same thing with satyrs instead of Timbermaw because of the demonic runes
---
I just got this for Christmas üòé Disappointed by the pieces, I must admit - they should be each race.
---
You realise that pvp specced rogue has 2 vanishes that remove all slows, 2 blinds that guarantee entering melee range with hunter if you get into blind range, 2 evasions that make them practically immune to most of your damage? That's on top of feign death/ freeze trap combo not even working properly half of the time, sometimes FD cancels so fast i don't even lose target and combo points. As a sub rogue its the easiest class for me to kill, I don't think I've ever lost to a hunter if I had the opener.
---
Theres no difference between the factions. For whatever reason though, majority of the complaints in this sub are from alliance players. Doesnt necessarily mean much and you shouldnt let it influence your decision, as the % of people doing it are very small and skews your perspective.  
---
Only real thing to worry about when picking a faction is, dont pick the faction that is extremely small like skeram alli or heartseeker horde, AH will suck and so will pugging anything. Play what you like.
---
Quite the opposite, last time someone did this they got a C&amp;D from Blizzard
---
My guildie was selling boosts in Armory and Cathedral yesterday and we did like 3 runs per hour, at 2.5g per person, that comes out to 30g/h.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how much it tanked. I remember it going for 400-500g on my server in the month or so leading up to the honor release. Now it goes for a small fraction of that.
---
They probably do have it. But need 2 more for their twinks/alts lol
---
It absolutely isn't. A ninja can only occur if the rules are stated and everyone agrees.
---
-15% with talents.
---
I'm not really a huge fan of him but the amount of pure ad-hominem vitriol he gets is insane. They will call him a disgusting cave troll/ ugly etc etc in the same breathe as they call him toxic.
---
I personally don't mind the twitch app. Compared to the piece of shit that the Curse app was, the twitch app is very clean, it organizes and updates addons for Classic and Retail, and isn't a terrible app for watching streams. But regardless it's not like you have to run it in the background or anything. I only open it when I want to update add-ons and close it when I'm done.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have many issues in regards to mana.  Use mana gems as soon as you are missing enough mana so that it isn‚Äôt wasted.  The only fight I ever Evo on is Rag and even then something has had to go wrong that we lost too many dps to kill before submerge.
---
For Rag you pre pot the fire resistance potion as soon as you can so you can use a mana pot and then have time to use the fire resist potion again if there is a submerge.
---
That full pic makes it look even worse
---
Nothing you farm is going to be a noticeable difference in dps by themselves, but yet people farm them anyways. I wonder if it‚Äôs because people like feeling the sense of accomplishment rather than the cost benefit ratio of each point of dps gained versus time invested
---
Nah, that makes too much sense.
---
Premades for alliance mean whats left for pugs are the bottom of the barrel players since the hardcore players are spamming premades. Alliance pugs are hell.
---
everyone go kill north, about a dozen stay back and defend drek.
---
Doesn't work.  The age verification popup on Imgur just reloads over and over after I click yes.
---
No joke, I ran BRD arena for like the 100th time it feels like, with a buddy, our second boss that came out was Gorosh, it was finally Savage Gladiator Chain. It was a Christmas Miracle!!
---
almost all classes would have a way to pick the flowers that doesnt necessarily involve soloing the two elites. 
---
- mage: poly one, nova one away from the spawn (or just nova both), pick flower
---
- lock: howl of terror and/or void tank both momentarily, pick flower
---
- hunter: pet tank both, pick flower
---
- warr: intimidating shout, pick flower
---
- pala: bubble (can you herb during bubble?), pick flower
---
- rogue: sap one, gouge/blind one, pick flower
---
- priest: psychic scream, pick flower
---
as a druid you could maybe root one away from the spawn, bear form &gt; bash, pick flower
---
the only class i cant really think of how they could handle this for sure would be shammy, and even then you could probably kite them away, and then earthbind and run back quick and try and pick it before they get to you
---
Demonic runes share a cd with mage gems, might be worth it later but for mc its unnecessary.
---
Makes me really thankful that I'm in a good guild. We basically share loot, technically open rolls but there's a lot of "you take this and I'll take that" arrangements. As a competitive loot class (mage) I've been really fortunate to have items passed on to me, and I return the favor. Much more mature than my experience in vanilla/BC.
---
An upgrade is an upgrade is an upgrade.
---
As an alchemist, the recipe is worth more because you can make more selling the flasks then non-alchys can selling the recipe.
---
I say "ALL NEED" every time and if someone already rolled greed, tough cookies
---
You really are a bit simple.
---
So, I'm Horde and have been nearly my entire time playing. I spent about a year and a half on Alliance, that's where I started because that's where the people I was playing with were. Raided up to Gruull, including as a mage tank on Maulgar. I started on Hellscream, a higher pop Ally dominant server. I say that to give perspective.
---
In my experience, Horde players are more fun. Less raging in chat, fewer edgelords trying to incite reactions, more passing buffs and assistance, a vaguely stronger comrade feeling. I started Horde on a Druid in the middle of BC, fell in love and haven't looked back. I've tried to level Alliance characters repeatedly, many classes across many servers. It's just a colder, less personal experience. 
---
Case in point- I'm in the vineyard in the human starting area, standing on a barrel of grapes fighting a mob on my baby dorf paladin. A human paladin runs over and proceeds to attempt to loot the barrel I am standing on. A mob aggroed onto him so he failed, and when I typed out in /say "dude I'm right here, wtf) he went away. But that kind of thing does not happen on Horde. I'm a chronic altoholic. I level characters just to delete them, it's a mess. I'm always in the starting areas. I'm comfortable saying it's less common on Horde. Ran WSG on a baby dorf hunter. Level 13. Promptly get told I'm crippling the team by being there, and as the Horde 3 cap us chat devolves into finger pointing and name calling. Ran a WSG on my Horde characters, and people are thanking others for heals as we get 3 capped. 
---
That's the difference between Horde and Alliance for me.
---
Praise the sun!
---
If you are getting to a point of using Evoc then your raid is not doin very good dps.
---
I use ruby at 75% mana, superior mana pot (major mana pot not really needed for this raid content) at 75% again, and this lasts me till end of fight.
---
In Ragnaros (my guild not always gets rag down before submerge because at times we go with only 35 players) i use the same strat till submerge and Evoc while we get sons together. (when we go to submerge phase Rag usually is at around 10% so no citirne or pot needed).
---
Also theres a trick to get the most out of your Evocation: get your hands on Soulkeeper (blue staff with shit tons of spirit - because Evoc is based on your own mana regen wich is based on spirit- and macro a change weapon while Evoc), this way you can get more out of your Evoc ticks.
---
Alliance is playing to win and honor grind. Horde is playing to win and have fun. Hence why the turtle is working and the rush is not.
---
It's the fact that parties get in together that breaks it. They get in parties then synchronize the party queues.
---
Simple randomizer would likely go a looonnng way towards fixing it.
---
IDK who Bjergsen is lol.
---
I came here to ask this as well. What no life, hardcore, Adderall fueled guild is raiding on X-mas day lol.
---
Will PVP for sure, isn‚Äôt that the point of classic tho? Get gear to pvp with
---
Tbh if you got 2 baron cloaks in 3 runs thats pretty nuts in itself, i ran it around 24 times and saw one cloak, just gave up when av came out and bought the av cloak instead
---
Well, there's an important distinction to "being good" and having the time to farm the correct items and such
---
When you see 3/5 party members roll greed on a BoE its not 'common etiquette' to roll need for yourself.
---
We just did not want to have to hang out with gnomes all day without the opportunity to kill them.
---
What a riduculous statement, fact is that alot of players are just trying to grind honor in the best way possible. If other alliance can queue premades and stomp horde every time, i gotta do the same if i wanna be at all competive with rankings and all.
---
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
---
You just have to not take it so seriously. I'm 60 with like 6 - 8 epic items, I still need strat UD cape and HoJ trinket, I'm probably never going to get them. Fuck it, new content will replace it. I'm having fun pvping and farming honor. I get outrolled on all kinds of shit, I go on about my day, I have more important shit to get mad about lol.
---
great suggestions
---
This whole thread is full of armchair economists who are selfish. Unless there was an agreement at the start of the dungeon, utility is the priority. Price isn‚Äôt a consideration.
---
Most of the arguments in the thread are for selfish short term gold gains. 
---
Take a moment and consider why are flasks so expensive above material costs? Because armchair ‚Äúcapitalists‚Äù need it for their short term selfish gold gains rather than maximum utility of the profession holder. 
---
This then leads to the profession holder having to shell out hundreds or thousands of gold on the AH (of which 10% disappears from fees), and then they think ‚Äúwell, I just dumped so much gold on this recipe, I‚Äôve gotta make it back. Increase prices for my crafted item!‚Äù.
---
These crafted items appear on the AH (of which 10% disappears again...) and people bitch and complain about prices of the crafted item without stopping and thinking:
---
‚Äúholy shit, our myopically selfish social contract is fucking over the server economy‚Äù.
---
Agreed you should post your guilds kill times.
---
Know what is great? I checked earlier this morning for live chat and it said 10am PST so 1pm EST. Checked again just now and it says 1pm PST it opens now ... what a joke this bullshit.
---
I‚Äôd agree if the others naively rolled greed, the last few needed and didn‚Äôt realize that was going to happen and were given a proper chance to roll after the fact.
---
No point I guess unless ur not hit capped yet üò≠
---
Also for farming, the extra pet dmg is nice. But either way, having Bestial Wrath and the other 11 points can be a ton of fun!
---
I think it‚Äôs already relevant, just not 100% needed. I main a rogue and have a great FR set. Core hound leather boots etc. I rarely go full set, but can get to 74 very comfortably (pre buff) and still pull great DPS. 
---
I‚Äôve had successful raids without it on, sure, but I die more. Being able to take a fire blast to the face and live is nice. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre a tank (or want the libram regardless) - Buy your libram of resilience now while it‚Äôs only 10-20g. Those will get expensive when BWL drops.
---
Going to miss mine as a tank and pvp grind on a heated server, but wwho cares the blue at Blizz says they will get to it in an hour.  Bull fucking shit. I have a ticket that is 2 days old.
---
not going to lie i wish they would have buffed some of the fights in MC. our guild has never seen p2 on Rag we kill it too fast. Shazzrah falls over without teleporting. giving us 1.12 talents and gear and not buffing mc accordingly had made it a push over.
---
Usually it‚Äôs as simple as putting a concerted effort towards defense. You don‚Äôt need a ton of offense bc they are all rushing. 
---
Tactically, you can call out which way they are rushing and intercept them in the field, then try to wipe them at Galv. 
---
The offense goes straight to Balinda and then have a few more recall to take back any of the towers they attempted to cap.
---
Because for that gold/cloth you can buy better bags or other important things. It matters for the first char. For other chars I don't get it either.
---
are there api docs or like a helpful guide to basic scripting commands like this for wow that you know of/recommend? i'm a developer by trade so love this kind of stuff but just unfamiliar with syntax
---
Something I think I stumbled on: die, run anywhere you like as a ghost, find a pool of water, submerge in it, relog and your ghost will start drowning. After your ghost dies, respawn at the new location.
---
I've stopped counting my UBRS runs at 60. That was a few weeks ago and I do a solid 5-6 every weekend getting our new guildies attuned. I've never seen the Truestrike Shoulders drop. I genuinely think that my name or character model or something about my account is bugged and prevents them from dropping.
---
Yeah seriously OP I‚Äôm trying to masturbate and get honor at the same time, yeeeeesh
---
How fortunate. Mine is 2 days old.
---
One after the other...
---
Sooo what about fast OH ? üòÇ that meta.
---
It‚Äôs faster honor too. We don‚Äôt want long battles and the horde do. Simple as that.3k honor in 8 mins or 2k honor in 40..
---
or you could just let people enjoy things
---
Horde gets like 2 on average
---
I would personally finish out your mob killing quest and maybe get a small stockpile of mats before you respec. I would make sure you have the hydraxian waterlords intro quests done, All of the kill quests from tirion and if you're horde Nathanos gives you like 3-4 quests which are effectively "kill 30 of each mob in the zone". After that I would probably go to azshara/felwood and grind on the satyrs to 60. This will get you a decent stockpile of demonic runes and runecloth/felcloth if you're tailoring.
---
Or you could just ignore that and once you have the tirion/hydraxian quests done you can respec and start grinding dungeons for your prebis. Either way you're going to hit 60 it's just how prepared you want to be when you get there.
---
You just parroted another comment wanna read my response to that?
---
Charge and intercept are not spells, they are physical stuns just as cheap shot and kidney.
---
How does it not make sense?
---
That's because the game is in a lull rn. Everyone has mc and ony on farm or are in AV. All the theory crafting and stuff like that is in class discords. I'm sure when BWL drops there will be plenty of posts about strats and stuff.
---
This is why cross server dungeon finder is terrible
---
I hate you. Never seen it
---
Probably should have just done a second roll and traded it to the winner
---
Yep not going to lie I only need my second Caut band priest wrists and priest boots. Ive been clearing since week 5 IIRC. This content is just too easy, granted a lot of our player base is from private servers but I only think 25% of us played vanilla most are TBC and Wrath server vets. I log in Craft my mooncloth Raid MC for an hour and a half then q av and watch netflix during my 25 min Q or just go play another game dont really do much in the game besides sit in a city or in raid. Feels eerily like WoD lol
---
It goes mages&gt;locks&gt;pallys for us(before looking at other factors). We only do MC with about 25-30, so it's getting close to pallys.
---
Quite a bit--check out [dev.battle.net](https://dev.battle.net). However, not much in the way of automation such as the op who appears to want to afk bot BGs.
---
It's silly to suggest that everyone *know* horde would be overpopulated given that ally were overpopulated in vanilla.
---
Sounds good!
---
And who is gonna whine incessantly about that? Look at what happened when the game dropped any worthwhile post was downvoted because the casuals were threatened by information.
---
No iirc it‚Äôs 150rep per win. Play WSG for fun if you get exalted then cool.
---
We do this a little, but it's tentative based on attendance/performance etc. It is subject to LC, but most of the time it goes in the list order.
---
your lack of faith in other people is not mine, much less anyone else‚Äôs problem. if you deem small scale humor designed to make someone chuckle to be lower than you, then you have bigger issues than not finding something funny. just let people live ffs.
---
Queues are cross-faction, your honestly just on the odd pvp server
---
can confirm, literally my tactic. Tired of being queue with idiots that don't listen anyways and turtle the game for an hour.
---
I have no idea why people like that fucking clown
---
Your on average 2x longer and up to 3x than my guilds kills (which is why your having so many mana issues). Not a big deal just a bit slower, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs gear related/consume related since I think kills of this manner aren‚Äôt going to fly during the couple BWL checks. Anyways your system to manage mana seems fine and it‚Äôs rare I just point to outside factors and say not much you can do but this is one of those cases. Hard to ask you to distilled wisdom when your melee probably aren‚Äôt using mongoose or the likes.
---
He can, the sarcasm is funny because it‚Äôs true
---
EXACTLY! People think it's pvp racials or whatever, but in reality, we're all just super racist towards gnomes, including me. And I like it that way.
---
Warlocks rarely drink during leveling. With BoW from a pala this will be even more pronounced, and with the additional heals its bonkers.
---
Warlock + any healer is the shit
---
Community is extremely toxic and demanding/entitled 
---
I am playing Enh Shaman and amount of shit I had to red for rolling on ‚Äúrogue/warrior/hunter‚Äù item is ‚Äúquite‚Äù high
---
On the other hand people simply know what they really need and everyone runs ‚Äúreserved‚Äù runs
---
So... well that‚Äôs new meta
---
Eh, I guess so. In a perfect world people would play it because they enjoyed it, not because they felt like they had to, but it is naive of me to think that would happen.
---
It's nice to get but don't obsess over it, nothing worse getting decked out and loosing all motivation to play
---
The premades have  nothing to do with parties. They arent even on the save server much less grouped together in a party
---
How
---
LOL. Where did I say it was their race that made it possible to come up with jazz, hip-hop, and rap? You are the ones obssessed with genes and biological determinism, not us. White people may have come up with those things, but they sure didn't for as long as European cultures have existed (so from Ancient Greece to the Renassaince, so ~1800 years), so what evidence do you have that they would in the next 500 years? 
---
Again, you are the one asserting some grand statement of universal importance when I never claimed anything of the sort. I'm merely telling you what has already happened in our universe: African slaves in the Americas, ripped of their former cultures, bonded over music as a way to escape from their physical pain and misery, and eventually shared their musical traditions with the rest of American society to the enrichment of all races. Would white people also have done the same if they were put in the same circumstances in some alternate universe? Maybe, maybe not, we'll never know because we aren't in those alternate universes.
---
Sarcasm yeah but that was exactly how match ended up going :D the only bg lead who has been followed till the end!
---
Weapon drops in dungeons are worth 5-10g.  Since I equally need the gold and the warrior will most likely be using the weapon to farm gold out in the world, does your argument give me the right to roll need on something I will not use?  
---
If the Alchemist/Tailor/whatever won the item and then learned the recipe right after - I would have zero problem.  If they "hold onto it for later", then yeah that's a shitty thing to do.
---
So does your group run with 30 warriors and just cleave the entire run? That would be the most optimal way to run content.  
---
When you're comparing the two classes, are you also taking into account the dps increase to those in the shaman's group from SoE, WF/GoA totem twisting? Or when nightfall is released, the ability to consistently keep a +15% spell damage debuff consistently on bosses? The additional utility to off-heal/purge? It's a support class, so if you're not factoring in the support portion, of course it's easy to say just get another warrior instead.
---
Because its worth exactly the same amount of gold to everyone there.   
---
Its very standard that you don't just get to have a 200+ gold recipe because you claim to have a particular profession. Everyone knows this, look at the other comments.   
---
Any alchemist worth his salt would just buy the recipe and make money with it.
---
Yeah the chicken littles don‚Äôt understand that it took X months between MC and BWL because the game was both released unfinished, and in a much harder state with a worse player base. Arguably they could‚Äôve started vanilla with BWL in the game and the timeline wouldn‚Äôt have changed at all
---
I think I read that - but it's very wrong.
---
The price of a recipe on the AH is based on the understanding that the buyer will continually use the recipe. It means the same gold to everyone, if it were worth more to the alchemist they would have bought it.
---
Tbh I just don't think rape jokes the day after Christmas are that funny, but all the power to you if you do. If someone is bashing two rocks together (like this joke) you have a choice, you can keep letting them enjoy smashing rocks together or try to lead them to something they will likely enjoy much more.
---
From what I have seen the only time information is downvoted is when it is incorrect. This game has loads of misinformation surrounding it because people find posts and info from private servers and dont realize it and think it applies to classic. Also it's a forum about a game that's been out for 15 years dont take it so seriously.
---
because alliance have instant queue
---
it was always possible....
---
I know as soon as they ally wipe on galv its over. They never attempt to re-zerg to horde base, they just camp stonehearth trying to stop us from getting north or they trickle over to the field of strife one by one to be killed. 
---
but please keep doing it i only need 3k honor to get exalted
---
I've done both holy/reck 25/26/0 and holy/ret 31/0/20. Both are great for PvP and PvE and it depends on which style you prefer in the bgs and if other pallys in your raid have kings. If you enjoy healing in bgs, I'd go holy/reck since you can take a lot of damage while you heal and then turn around and 5 hit someone with one swing, plus having a reduced cd on BoP and increased duration of freedom is awesome. Holy/ret is way more fun for damage output with the burst potential. You can still heal if you choose, but youll likely just want to do damage. I like Holy/ret more because its nice to switch things up from healing in raids all the time and with phase 3 coming soon, having full t2 for this spec will be incredible.
---
/cry or fart are my go to‚Äôs. Adding /shrug
---
db?
---
Lol showing your ignorance on many levels. You are probably the hunchback gnoll of your generation.
---
Its bis, so calm the fuck down boi
---
For warrior? Bracers are better than mc stuff, hit is a meme on this server so id say theyre bis till aq. As far as pants go, theyre very close to r12 pants. But now blue set shoulder pants are decent. Youd have to compare bwl shoulders and wsg pants to rank blue set 2pc, and then check if theyre even better than r12. But tbh, if youre rank 12 youre easily exalted wsg. I know av is the meta but it takes 3 days of real wsg premade ranking to hit exalted, and youll easily do that between av‚Äôs on your path to r12. Only pants that are better than wsg/r12 pants are aq aswell
---
&gt;detect the sarcasm
---
\*\*\*\*Sarcasm Detected\*\*\*\*
---
That‚Äôs stated in a previous comment and I believe would have been the correct thing to do. Unfortunately for me last night, I literally had no concept that it was an issue. I just sorta thought they were all being babies. I just didn‚Äôt occur to me that we should reroll.
---
It depends on if the potion itself can be sold for a lot of gold. Meaning he will have no introduction costs, and can start selling for a profit immediately. So even if he learns it as soon as winning it, he can potentially be taking gold from the others. Especially since those expensive potions are all optional, to make someone better, and are never needed. The entire thing is greed rather than need.
---
Considering YT is changing policy to remove most ads from videos targeted at children, of course everyone is going to claim their audience is all adults now.
---
You can argue it, but its a shit argument.
---
The flask has a market value.  Its not like the alchemist would be willing to pay more than the AH price of the flask. If he is, then why not pay your members a small fee for essentially stealing 200 gold from them?
---
I approve.
---
Love kiwis. Check out viva la dirt league if you haven't already (youtube)
---
Even if I were in a casual guild armor is the last thing I want on a hunter. You have healers to keep you alive. You don‚Äôt need world buffs or consumes.. you do need to wear gear that increases your damage though. If you‚Äôre worried about staying alive in mc as a hunter then I guess you have bigger problems. Either rely on your healers or find a guild that isn‚Äôt so bad hunters care about armor and stam for raiding.
---
Usually 1g flat for all mage services. If I need a port and food/water i'll tip 1g, just food/water 1g, just a port 1g. Just keeps things simple. If I were to buy 6 stacks of food/water from a vendor i'd be getting worse water and probably be spending 3-4g
---
I saw these on sale at Costco but never heard of the company lol
---
No, that's not worth it.
---
We've still got like at least a month I'd think until you can make it.  I don't think it's that hard for a guild to come up the the ~5k gold for the bars in that time, or to just do jump runs in that time to get the bars themselves.  Hell I made 1.2k gold this past week by myself
---
Here's your statement just in case you aren't clear:
---
&gt; If African Americans never contributed their musical culture, white people would never have had anything to build on.
---
You are here arguing that it would have been impossible for white people to come up with jazz music if black people didn't exist. You're just an alt-right troll.
---
Nah... 3k honor every 7-8 mins is better.
---
&gt; Statistically, im in a semi-hardcore guild and i know at least 10 warriors who farmed for it and how long it took them
---
&gt; im the one who is against anecdotal evidence here
---
You know what they say:  "Drek or Kek."  As a member of the horde, I can confirm that if you guys don't Drek, there is lots of Kek.
---
He is a troll and cocky and invites the hate because he know that any publicly is good publicly.
---
He adapted what he learned from the 2016 election to his stream.
---
He is just a man, but neckbeards and beta orbiters respect him and hate him for all the wrong reason.
---
Asmon is a smart guy, who has played the streaming game well.
---
That‚Äôs if you win and Drek rush works.  What do you do once it it fails?
---
Don't transfer raw gold though. The cut is too steep. Try to find some things of high value that sell quickly on either faction and use them to transfer funds.
---
BoEs should always be needed. I don't care if you are an alchemist. If you want the item, buy it from the winner. If you really wanted the item, you would have already bought it from the AH.
---
I did 3 full cath runs (killing every single mob) in about 1 hour. Netted around ~40g in gold drops, boe‚Äôs, silk cloth which I turned into bandages. This isn‚Äôt counting the radiant shards I put up on AH for 2-3g per. SM cath is pretty good money. You can also get lucky and pray for a Staff of Jordan drop
---
Thank you. There's also another guy in here trying to promote race-realism. Like wtf is going on?
---
I can only imagine how his AVs go. GUYS WERE AGAINST ASMON, EVERYONE RECALL NOW!!
---
That‚Äôs exactly greed over need though lol. Money to them, which is why they rolled greed. Need for you because you can use it to sell and make money? That‚Äôs greed to just with more steps!
---
Bloodsail is probably one of the nicest realms that I've ever been on.
---
Hi
---
Welcome to 5 man WoW dungeon guide regarding ‚ÄúHow to roll on gear‚Äù
---
You roll on whatever the f.... you want
---
It‚Äôs 5 man
---
You can do it again same day. And again and again
---
If you want to follow some ‚Äúrules‚Äù e.g MS&gt;OS I am sure a lot of people will appreciate it
---
You will stop appreciating it once e.g you will go as Healer to BRD and dps Druid/shaman/priest will roll on ‚Äúyour‚Äù second wind.
---
So yep... roll on whatever you want want
---
/love üòÄ
---
Ive been saying it for a while; the hordes strat is based on pure spite.
---
There are no fast epics until Phase 4 (not including rank 14), even then the only bis fast oh swords are in naxx.
---
"It originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.[2] Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".[3] Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation.[4] Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.[5] Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms"
---
So without African-American contributions, you'd be left with.. European military band music. Care to tell us how often you hear John Phillip Sousa on the radio these days?
---
Oh wow, well credit where credit is due I suppose. Is that why that beef with Tali and him was so big, well bigish?
---
Is it really sarcasm if that's exactly what happens afterwards?
---
Speak for yourself, I‚Äôm spamming premades and massacring you guys as you port into relief hut.
---
It is but not really that important since in prebis gear you soft crit cap is somewhere around 41% and hit past soft cap isnt very valuable due to hs cancel bug.
---
My hunter friend rolled on hoj right after I told him it's not for him.  He saw ap and quickly rolled need.  This was his 2nd run and I had done over 100.  Still dont have an hoj and he doesn't even use his.
---
People should just be upfront about this. As a Druid I always try to clear this with the group. If I need something for another spec I say so when we‚Äôre forming and I never roll on anything but one of my spec‚Äôs BiS
---
Almost every time I'm tiped it's 1g.
---
What does this have to do with the game?
---
&gt;Have fun zerging av for honor, over the next 5 months, maybe you'll get that sweet rank 7
---
you do understand that horde only compete against horde for honor?
---
Ideas can be game related?
---
What's the drop rate on that?
---
Okay even at 1000g it definitely isn't going take 7-8 months to break even. On most servers you can break in at 1-2 months. On my server you can have it for 700g and it makes 10-13g a day.
---
Nothing. Just some dork bragging about getting money.
---
Afk out wait for a new one. Still faster because the losing is mostly rare.
---
I've always played dps warrior and  for my dps and tanking set ilevel progression it was way better in vanilla with less warriors in raid and DKP than now with the loot council and lots of warriors.
---
cool, thanks! working on anything fun you feel like sharing? always curious about what people do
---
if you reserve yes.
---
the OP QQ'ing about a warrior needing a green weapon... we're far from reserving orbs or such.
---
Idk who these people are, but I‚Äôm sure a bunch of dorks are up-in-arm while about some ‚Äòcontroversy‚Äô while Asmon and Tali are laughing all the way to the bank!
---
Media is bullshit and anyone who gets too invested in it is being played.
---
If you use this shield first and then barrier, mana shield, and others, this shield will last the longest
---
I'm always suprirsed by how many people struggle with classic dungeon.
---
Oh man, this guy and his 60% mount speed preaches.
---
Depends on the day, but you still have to account for that 15 min in calculating your time
---
Some questions are stupidly hard like weapon master name, there's no reason we would remember the name of all npcs that you only talk to once and half not even being from your faction.
---
 but very good quizz overall
---
Save it.
---
I think alliance actually have winning percentages in AV.  It's just the difference between a premade and a pug is getting bigger.  A pug is lucky to have 1-2 people with 100% mounts as most with them join in to premades.  Not to generalize but this also is most likely a lot of the better geared players.  This means while premades are stomping through horde our pigs are on the recieving end a lot.
---
you forgot to censor 3 names :P
---
Assuming you already have a subscription going and a decent PC to run the game, save your money.
---
&gt; Cool video, but your raid is doing less than half the dps that my guild would do on that fight. There's no way warlock could keep up on threat.
---
With searing pain and proper gearing it's more than possible.
---
call me back when you get a epic'd out warrior tank and see the repair bill after a LBRS or UBRS.
---
now compare that to the 10 silver a caster get cause he got hit by a lava spider on the way there.
---
Because he actually has a YouTube channel where he very rarely posts video with the persona off
---
Leozonta toezd serendipity
---
50 minute queue?
---
Sgc is Bis for threat too so wear it no matter your spec
---
Yeah I'm not too invested in that stuff lmao. I watch bellular, Taliesin and evitel, Mr. GM, pyromancer, and just started watching admin for wow info and that's it really
---
or by someone who did tank during vanilla and picked accordingly this time.
---
call me back when your tank is epiced out and stop loosing aggro so your caster don't get hit.
---
And how does that make it worth "EXACTLY the same" to a non-alchemist?
---
Atlasloot I believe!
---
This is probably going to sound incredibly ignorant....but what should I do to make my account more secure?
---
I love how I try to add some help, but because I was mistaking the gear set OP is talking about, I get downvoted. Ppl cease to amaze me with how horrible they can be
---
It‚Äôs the problem of having a strat that is based around a sufficiently large chunk of your team doing the same thing.  Horde just kinda durdles all over the map slowly, incidentally taking objectives, while the alliance tries to make big plays and dies because they don‚Äôt have the big group to make those plays.
---
Mirage raceway. It is pve realm. There are a lot of leveling people there. More low lvls than on big realms, also less of them are in dungeons because we are more casual and there is no ganking. Also probably some refugees here because of phase 2 ganking
---
Good thing he's been saying it since 2017 and that youtube isn't his platform
---
Fuck that, any item worth a decent amount of gold or more always roll need. Those guys are idiots.
---
Sending all my luck your way! I've used up most of mine for a while though :)
---
Gnaark, I appreciate your comment and hope you didn't downvote me due to an honest mistake.

Yes, won the 2nd on a greed. That mainhand drop every time. Last time we gave it to a dagger rogue. I've seen it much more than the shoulders.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to run out of the keep if Drek aggros you do you don‚Äôt die and give horde any extra honor too

Do it.
---
A few dagger rogues, yea. We have 3 dagger rogues who all have perdi blade at this point but I can't bring myself to switch over. I love swords too much
---
He objectively was not being self righteous so it‚Äôs not really my opinion as much as an observation.
---
and Barkskin
---
Yeah, but the GMs say whatever. They're not at all consistent, it's just some dude making up something that sounds good. Who knows if it's company wide policy?
---
That isn‚Äôt struggling. General mana usage is in no way indicative of skill.
---
I mean if you ride a shitmount in AV you are basically useless
---
&gt; essentially stealing 200 gold from them?
---
And that's where your argument falls flat.  He isn't "stealing" from them.  They never owned/had the drop in the first place.  The player put in as much effort as everyone else in the group and should be entitled to upgrades just as much as anyone else.  
---
"I can get 200g on the AH for that" is not a valid argument to justify not letting someone have something that is an upgrade or would is a recipe for a profession.
---
Now its not activating on regular stand up during combat crits on me either?
---
Got my SGC on my third arena run.
---
This is a hate the game, not the player situation. The vanilla pvp reward system is fundamentally broken for encouraging this behavior.
---
You are aware that gear takes durability just from being in combat, right? Casters taking zero damage would still incur a repair bill.
---
I can‚Äôt shift + left click to put an item in chat.

I'm a 60 SM/DS warlock looking for a good guide on how to solo DME. I'm also a miner. Could someone point me in the right direction?
---
It doesn‚Äôt! It makes it even more greed focused for the alchemist! They‚Äôll sell the potions to make gold! No one NEEDs potions in this game. So all the other people just sacrificed gold so that alchemist has no upfront costs now and go straight past go to making a profit.
---
It's apparently an issue where thresh just queues additional attacks instantly even if the attacks can't be used. So thrash goes on cooldown and then comes back up and queues more attacks
---
Preach
---
You need to set up your pet so that it stays right next to the mobs spawn location. That way, it won't run away when it evades and instead your pet will pull aggro. Once that's set up, you stand on top of this ruin block and auto-attack for the aggro-pendulum between you and your pet to start swinging. Every other ranged attack is an evade. Don't forget to heal your pet every now and then.
---
Also like.... when Bill Murray was a relevant A list celebrity there were a lot less crazy fans in the world.  Now it seems like everyone is fucking nuts.  It wouldn't surprise me if asmon (who is way less famous than Bill Murray) receives more violent threats than Bill ever did.
---
Durability is lost just from being in combat. You‚Äôre clearly speaking from one POV sand have zero grasp of others experiences. A basic tank only concerned with themselves.
---
Blizzards fucked the report system. You can report these people afk all you want and it does sweet fuck all...
---
There is no "potentially be taking gold from the others."  If that's your argument then where does it end?  Do you calculate how long the person will play the game, and analyze how often they go herbing to then come to an average GPH that they would be getting from the Flask, and then demand that you get a fraction of that gold?  No, that's ridiculous.
---
You guys have a hard with with a joke...
---
They nerfed lasher's from 1.4 drop table of like 12g per pack to like 2 or 4 gold per pack. It's still one of the best farms period
---
Where do these hacks come from? Downloading addons with viruses?
---
Had the same happen to me in Cata, banned for "gold selling" so I guess they mailed/traded my gold etc.  Appealed, denied, quit WoW until a couple months ago w/ Classic.
---
Glad to hear it worked out better for you - I STILL want to know how they got in when I had a key fob authenticator.
---
Repost? Saw this post earlier today. Nice advertisement

Try Adibags. Fully custom categories.

i let my kids play when im at work so dont bother with it

Yes? Since when is sarcasm dependent upon the outcome of future events?
---
From an unsolicited outside perspective, you definitely seem like you need to stop investing did much into a game man. Think about the amount of negativity you just put out into the world before you start repeatedly calling someone else a cunt on Reddit maybe

I just 2 man it with a healer, really not that bad once you get it down.
---
There‚Äôs more to the game than mount speed. 
---
Whose more useless? The guy with the 100% mount that rides up, and dies in 10 seconds over and over because they play stupid? Or the guy that strolls in on his 60% mount and lives for several minutes because he plays smart?
---
ok stop thots
---
Because there's less loot and the raids are full of crap loot. Just a few actually good items that everybody wants. Hope it will get better with the next raids.
---
Joel leaking in wow lol

You still need to be in range to do any of that. After first trap I stay at 41yds with cheetah, and even if you sprint vanish i will have serpent up when I start kite.
---
Ugh our leaf to eye ratio is like 10:1. I‚Äôm a hunter so  I was pumped at first but it‚Äôs getting to be a joke at this point..
---
Not bad just slower!
---
Did the eye see you? You should be able to stealth past everything except the hyenas and the eye patrols. For those you need to kill them between the two packs after the first door, or before the first pack
---
Sounds like you guys are killing things a little slow.  You are doing fine it seems with mana
---
What? Lol
---
It‚Äôs not potential lost revenue. It IS lost revenue.

If the alchemist learns but never sells the potion, then he didn‚Äôt NEED it in the first fucking place did he???

Yo mate
---
What exactly you looking for üòÄ
---
If you want to lvl up shaman full enh is the way to go at least till 40 then depending on your gear.
---
If you have enough spell power gear you can go Ele 40-60.
---
For 60 lvl
---
There are few options
---
Enh/resto for dps and totem twisting spec
---
Enh/ele for pure dps 
---
Ele/resto for quasi raid healing on short fights and farming/pvp outside of raid 
---
Deep Ele
---
Deep resto
---
There are enh/resto for raidnhealing 0/22/29
---
A lot of options available üòÄ
---
How hard is it to screencap something??
---
361 runs for mine. I hope your friend gets his much much sooner lol
---
I'm typically a prot warrior who had the chest and boots crafted just to use on Rag for threat reasons. Was randomly looking at the other pieces and set bonuses and was extremely surprised at how much AP each individual item had while also having really strong set bonuses.
---
The set is even part of current tier BiS option (non-PvP gear) if you have SGC and the MC gloves. You can use BDS legs, shoulders and boots with SGC and Flameguard Gauntlets.
---
Do you guy not have a phone?
---
Not sure on the drop rate but for whats it worth, it dropped on my first attempt with a group and I won the roll. So it might be 100% or I just got really lucky.
---
I made one on my obscure twitch account, but that was during testing with my voice acted clips. I'll try to make one some time this week and update this post for you.
---
Hit 20 last night. Love the combat and totems
---
Wows loot mechanics already struck me as the loot magically teleporting into my inventory. I guess the change from waiting individually to only doing it once didn't bother me. Wasn't there also an option to turn that off?
---
OP is wondering if its WORTH the time for a dps fury warrior. If he was looking for a sense of pride and accomplishment he wouldnt be here asking if it's worth. It simply isnt worth it. I went back and simmed it against cadaverous and the difference is so minuscule that unless you are bringing full world buffs and raid consumes to chase parses it simply doesnt make any logical sense. To put it in perspective a grilled squid adds more dps...
---
It's based on maximizing rep and honor per minute, including time spent in queue. AKA spite.
---
xD xD xD
---
I am OP. Not an advertisement just shouting out a talented friend who made a special gift for me to give.
---
It‚Äôs totally acceptable for a Druid or warrior tank to roll offspec IF they let party know before hand and give them an option to leave. Otherwise people assume MS&gt;OS.
---
That was already 10 years ago!?
---
I agree with your reasoning as a Druid myself. Just let the group know before you zone it and it‚Äôs usually no trouble at all.
---
Can't decide between Ashbringer, Earthshaker, Firemaw &amp; Mograine.
---
Looking for high population, decent faction balance etc. I will be going Ally.
---
Not if she's been with you first!
---
^(Merry Christmas.)
---
At the moment none of the items are even available.
---
well 3/5 cant even use it so not the OPs fault. he can use it and therefore a need is pretty appropriate.
---
&gt; Looking at you, undead. 
---
Interesting insight. What gives you that impression?  
---
It is accurate, ofc ;)
---
That is not how that should be working at all, missing more than one raid  should be dropping them to the bottom of the list.
---
Sorry but sounds like your Guild's doing a broken version of ksk
---
Hey everyone, what‚Äôs the ideal rotation for warrior tanking? I just did deadmines tanking for the first time and I would charge in, wait for enough rage to thunder then do the shouts, then just switch to defensive and tab between the targets to build threat on each one, but had a pretty hard time holding aggro for all the targets. Any tips?
---
Haha yeah, they totally deserve this for making a Horde character back in 2006, finding a great guild, and then choosing to play with their old guild in 2019!
---
I mean the premades have a 90%+ win rate so are they really?
---
I appreciate the advice, I'll throw one up by this weekend.
---
Idk what eye of the storm is, but I'm assuming it's something similar to Reckoning. Getting crit while sitting womt stack any of those "on-crit" abilities, but because of the spell-batching in classic, you can get your procs if you stand up between the tick where you're hit and the tick where the damage rolls. Basically just spam sit/stand while getting hit until you get a feel for the right time to stand up.
---
Idk as a horde the only time I find alliance open world they are always in groups of 5
---
When I saw FoT I smashed need the second it dropped.
---
What's asmongold?
---
I think if you couldn't roll on it, you can't loot it. The game is not considering you there for the kill.
---
A raid boss
---
What? I win like 80% of my games as Horde usually in less than 30 minutes.
---
Also, the queue times are a blessing for the hardcore rankers. You are losing out of honor competitiveness is you even go take a shit as an Alliance.
---
We have time to farm gold, play other games, browse the web, do real life stuff ect, and still be competitive. 
---
I would fucking hate to have instant queues knowing any break I took was losing me losing out on honor per hour to some fuck wearing diapers IV'd up for nutrition and always requeuing for 20 hours straight a day no breaks.
---
It may be worth the same in value for buying and selling only. It‚Äôs worth far more to someone who can use over the long run though. It will benefit me and my guild. Why should I pay for it when it just dropped?
---
No its not worth, only thing available is the tabard rn and even then the items arent THAT good.
---
Making the game take 30 minutes for 3.5k honor vs making it take 10 for 3k honor, with a 20 minute queue time, is not maximizing honor per minute.
---
I have no remorse as Alliance on Kurri. Horde did the same damn thing and even more frequently all up WPL/EPL/BRM. I'm calling you out as a lil bitch.
---
How does he make massive amounts of money on his haters? From what I understand most of money a streamer makes is from subs and donations.
---
Two questions from a Hunter:
---
1) Is it safe to use pets on Baron? I haven't been brave enough to try because I don't want to accidentally blow up my raid.
---
2) I often notice that I'm the only Hunter putting their pet on Ony during phase 1/3. Is this unsafe? I haven't had a single issue with aggro so far.
---
They also have an advantage in AV how it's setup, the map makes it way easier for alliance to win
---
Yeah, loot council has a higher potential for corruption and a higher potential to be awesome compared to DKP, all depends on the group running the show.
---
It is irrelevant. There was no agreement in place backed up by text that discussed rules for ruling. It doesn't matter who rolls first or last in this instance. Everybody had a chance to roll Need. No reservations or rules made. The fact of the matter is, they probably didn't know the recipe was worth anything and didn't look it up til after the fact.  Lack of game knowledge does not constitute a ninja.
---
It's not since dire maul
---
Dude calm down.
---
He stole it by hitting need after they all hit greed, despite wanting the item for a greedy purpose.  He should have hit greed if they all did.  
---
" "I can get 200g on the AH for that" is not a valid argument to justify not letting someone have something that is an upgrade or would is a recipe for a profession. "  
---
a) You are not the one who decides what is a valid argument.  
---
b) Do you know the definition of a "valid argument"?  
---
c) Thankfully, the rest of the wow community who has played end game for more than a few days agrees that it is in fact a very valid argument.   
---
Some people just struggle to grasp basic economics.
---
Because pre bridge gy and bridge horde have impassable choke points. IBGY is situated in such a way that without a good group a turtle there sends you to Stone hearth and then horde running from ibgy just pick off people mid.
---
 There's very little for Alliance to adapt to, we can also turtle and turn the game into a long one or we can afk out and join a new game after 15 minutes. After galv dies if horde wipe you South it's faster and better honor to afk and join a new game than to try and get pugs on 60% mounts to regroup and make it past mid.
---
No I got past the eyes. It was the Demon that had a void Walker out, right before the bugs in the Halls. The void Walker saw me from a mile away. But I don't know why the void Walker was there. I've seen duo groups do it and he isn't there. Does that VW spawn after the hunter makes that pull or something? Or does the VW de spawn after a while?
---
For good hardcore guilds sure. People say that about mc yet there are a ton of guilds that haven‚Äôt downed rag yet. Killing shit in greens applies to hardcore guilds only.
---
Use printscreen ffs
---
Try it. The game is way more slow paced than Retail, so get ready to endless leveling and walks.
---
Found Asmon‚Äôs burner account...
---
And it was our fucking shadow priest that dispelled me.
---
Wrong, boomer doesn't have just one single definition. The 30 year old boomer meme is the reason why the word is being used so much.
---
People are loot whores, just the nature of the beast.
---
I'm going to sarcastically downvote you, then actually downvote you. But it's only sarcasm
---
I did about 50 arena anger runs for HoJ with my rogue buddy and we had the boss thad could drop it 3 times and it dropped 0 times
---
Agreed.  I'm just commenting on why it's two different alliance experiences.  Alliance in premades have 90%+ win rates and Alliance pugs have 20%- win rates.  Why you see some alliance on here who feel like they're losing so much.
---
You think I give a shit about your opinion?
---
Yes you should. Classic is less about the endgame and more about the journey (cliche af I know). There will always be people leveling up, whether they just started, or are leveling another alt. Most guilds will continue to run MC for a long time, you'll still be able to gear up no matter when you hit 60.
---
And ugly, balding troll?
---
Well then bear isn‚Äôt really your main spec in your example. Your just using it to help the group or whatever and to get your healing/dps gear. 
---
I think it boils down to the definition of main and offspec.
---
If you are planing to change specs then rolling for it is fine in my opinion. But Iets say a heal pala rolls on a 2 hand weapon because he might someday want to play dps then I think it‚Äôs unfair to someone who will certainly use that item now. 
---
But like you said, that is also just my opinion :)
---
It is bonus honor. You also get honor from honorable kills.
---
Sounds like a great way to wind up with a Hunter that has Thunderfury.
---
That‚Äôs why he made the joke in the first place...because that is how AVs trend lately. That doesn‚Äôt mean your team planned to intentionally play poorly from the onset
---
If you're 60 you can also use the spirits in DMT
---
What a friend you have.. :D
---
Are you stupid? Queues are longer horde side because there‚Äôs about 1.5x as many horde players as alliance
---
Ok, Kiddo, eat your cereal and make sure you ask mommy for money to go to the movies.
---
Asmon‚Äôs burner account
---
Either Firemaw or Mograine then
---
On Baron you want to run your pet to where people go to blow up and park it there. For ony you should be good. Toy can always dismiss when she's coming down then summon when tank has aggro
---
Right. The fact that you can sell and I can buy is not that relevant. I can -use- it. For me, for my guild, for profit. It‚Äôs why I rolled alchemy.
---
I‚Äôm starting to get indignant at the fact that people really believe 100g right now is as valuable as long term benefit for an in-game professional use.
---
That still doesn't explain to me why it's worth the same. Sure, selling it will net you a few hundred gold which you can use for things. But to an alchemist, it will net much more than a few hundred gold which will go further, and the alchemist can also now make that flask for the guild, which will help in progression if they're having trouble. No one "needs" potions, but they do help, although one may argue that they need them to top charts.
---
If the alchemist can profit more off of it than a non-alchemist, then it is worth more to the alchemist. Whether or not others in the group should give up tye gold they can make off it is up to the group, but it doesn't change the fact that the recipe is worth more to an alchemist.
---
Not really, in Classic hardcore means clearing MC in less than 2 hours
---
Casuals still kill ragnaros easily, not being able to kill Rag is extreme casual
---
Wow, clever
---
Imagine raiding on Christmas.  Just jokes, congrats man.  Super jelly!
---
I can do armory on my warrior (skipping killing herod) in ~12 mins.  So 5 runs an hour x 3g per person x 4 people = 60g plus like 6gish from coin drops
---
if phase 2 taught us anything, it's that random 1v1 or 2v2 AREN'T what WPvP is about.
---
Not enough to make up the difference unless you set up a pretty impressive camp on the alliance graveyards.
---
Honestly spec BM and your weapon choice is kind of inconsequential as long as it's level appropriate.
---
Were you in the dungeon when he killed gordok or were you still running back?
---
I feel like people are more obsessed with getting geared fast than getting geared at all. If MC is on farm you're gonna get your stuff at some point. I like your relaxed approach. Game is gonna drive you mad if you obsess over loot.
---
appropriately so, just run a tribute run normally, its no more than 20-30mins
---
I doubt much more horde are going to leave. A lot transferred here to PVP. Anyone that wanted to leave would have in the past week.
---
It's hysterical how salty you get over literally nothing, throwing insults as if I give even the slightest shit what you say about anything. OK boomer.
---
Smash sunder until you can't feel your fingers, and pray the DPS doesn't go all out in the first few seconds.
---
Yes, that makes sense.... If there are no other primary spec folks that you are taking gear from. 
---
First, let's assume you are in a guild. Let's also assume that you have 40 dedicated raiders and they show up every week, on time, with no subs (lol - just go with it).  Let's also assume that you successfully clear MC and Ony every week. With those clears, there is a limited amount of gear that has been released to your guild for your guilds use in future raids. At this point, it's not enough for everyone to be full epic. Not even close. So, in this case, it's most optimal to have everyone's primary spec get gear which can then be used towards future raids. If someone recieves OS gear in lieu of another guildy recieving MS gear, and then the OS gear doesn't get used next raid, it was essentially a wasted drop that could've been better applied to someone that will use it next raid. 
---
Now, that's assuming alot of things such as once weekly raids and guild progression with core group. Dungeons are different because you can run those as often as you like, and if you aren't in the same guild or working together, who cares. At that point it's just etiquette.
---
I was dead and didn't release until after he killed Gordok.
---
Indeed!
---
Therefore it‚Äôs quite common (or at least should be...) for PUG RL to ask before raid on what are you going to roll for  (not what you have/play) 
---
So Warriors can decide 2H/1H rogues sword/daggers  etc
---
I think the biggest problem is with things like bows (why would hunter need on anything other than Leaf) 
---
And spell power weapons/trinkets/rings/amulets etc for healers
---
Nah its fine. Dont wish to go back to the pre-BGs days where i keep getting ganked by horde.
---
1.12 AV has ruined PvP and the honor system entirely. It was the biggest mistake of Classic which they should undo before it's too late (a LOT of my pvp friends have quit).
---
If its a group of random people, I just need if I need. MS/OS, doesnt matter. On the one hand, you can think of it as pessimism, these people wouldnt bat an eye at rolling on something tank related. More generally though, if Im with randoms, why am I even doing a dungeon if not to get loot? And at this point, Im pretty much done gearing up for my MS, if, for example, Im only allowed to roll on tank gear, well, there isnt anything left out there for me, so I guess you guys can enjoy your group, Ive got a healthy list of friends and guildies who need a tank for runs.
---
they indeed have learned to deal with it.. by finding ways to exclude you from their group.
---
be carefull what you wish for, because you might get it.
---
Clearing mc in under 2 hours is easy even if you aren‚Äôt hardcore. People aren‚Äôt going to do it in greens. I keep hearing about this but it never happens.
---
Free advertising i guess.
---
only 80% sure of this, but IIRC, the 3 sec WF cooldown was introduced in TBC, because shamies learned to dual wield. I've seen a video showcasing extensive testing, showing that weapon speed doesn't change the relative value of different imbues, while you'd expect there to be a visible cut-off point if there was an internal cooldown to WF.
---
This is the curse of vanilla BGs, its been true on private servers for years and still true on classic. Alliance collapses into a binary: Premades win every game, PUGs lose every game. Horde is almost entirely pugs, and they fight extremely hard because they've waited in queues so long.  
---
Alliance starting the game with 10 people is brutal, the premaders are directly fucking their own side. But even without the queue exploits, it's always hard on alliance PUGs. Horde PUGs have all their hardcore players mixed in, whereas hardcore alliance play almost exclusively in premades.
---
Oh I agree, the premades are very good but the PUGs are not
---
You should roll the same as others. Basics of supply and demand.
---
The ah price of the item is based on the demand created by alchemists for the item and its limited supply.
---
That price is based on the demand for the crafted flasks used by many classes and the value they place on the item. That price affects the price of herbs needed for the flasks. 
---
Everyone in the room contributes in some way to the market price of that object. Its not magically worth more than AH price to you. The AH price is fuelled entirely by the demand created by alchemists.
---
lul
---
Thank you Nach, and yes the is the short of it. It checks for when when a quest flag fires in any of its three states (New quest, inprogress, or about to be completed), then it gets the id, checks to see if there is an audio file and plays it. 
---
The tricky part was getting when the separate audio files ended, there is a flag that fires when an ingame file finishes but not when a manually added mp3 does. So I had to make another program to get all of the audio file lengths and then set a timer for the description to play after the title finished and then the same for the objective with respect to the description.
---
There's not reason to do it but ti's easily doable
---
I have them too! You‚Äôre gonna kill the dps now! Also bracers of the eclipse are better than t1
---
It won‚Äôt be even close to what it was since so many players will be in BGs. Specially now since AV is the meta. World pvp is what made classic great.... don‚Äôt tell me you came to play wow for the hard raids?
---
Animation is awesome on these! Well done!
---
Oh no, some greedy idiots are ignoring you. Seriously it's better to be ignored by those people, they suck.
---
As a hunter, I sit halfway down the hill from SHGY to Balinda and pick off 60%ers who try to hang left. Pretty easy to conc, auto, aimed, multi, auto somene going that slow.
---
&gt; a) You are not the one who decides what is a valid argument.
---
Neither are you.
---
&gt; b) Do you know the definition of a "valid argument"?
---
I do.  Poor choice of words on my part.  Let me use your words and say that it's a "shit argument".  Does that make you feel better?
---
&gt; c) Thankfully, the rest of the wow community who has played end game for more than a few days agrees that it is in fact a very valid argument.
---
Citation needed.  Looks like the comments in this post are pretty split either way.  Miscommunication is the biggest thing.  And I feel sorry for any guild that you're in if you treat "the end game" like that.  Do you not give shit to your guildies because they would be "stealing" from you?  You can be a high level raider, while not being a greedy asshole.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Some people just struggle to grasp basic economics.
---
As a warrior I only rolled on fury gear if I did not need any prot gear from the instance and I let the group know ahead of time.  I feel if you're rolling for your MS and OS at the same time it is a bit of a dick move.
---
Careful, you might forget to finish your dinner your mom made for you, and then she wont drive you to the movies.
---
Yea this plus server wide LFG would be enormous QOL improvements. Not ever gonna happen, though. Its what makes classic "classic" for a lot of people.
---
Maybe. But claiming that gold buying will prevent botting is objectively false and a little naive. You even provided evidence for that when you used Runescape as an example. I'll provide a second example: EvE. Plex has been in thing in EvE for years now, but botting and RMT has continues to be a problem, a problem that keeps getting worse every year and has turned the game into an unplayable cesspit.
---
I mean, the op and his friend waited until the last second to need over their greed rolls...  op says it wasn't his intention but I don't think he gave a rebuttle roll after waiting it out.
---
About to reach 40, what do you recommend? (horde)
---
Should he have named it "____shock" or "____totem" or "oprahwindfury" instead?
---
These comments are so fuckin childish. We are all playing World of Warcraft ... the most 'no life' game of all time ... for the *2nd time*. And people have the nerve to throw out these comments to dismiss everything associated with PvP rather than discuss the massive flaws inherent in 1.12 pvp.
---
Nope. I‚Äôm gonna need video evidence. I will not take your word for it.
---
1g for a port 1g for full window
---
It will be close and even worse than pre-BGs. Why?
---
Because now honor farmers can gank in world while waiting for que to pop up, continue farming honor in BG. Rinse and repeat.
---
And yes, i play wow just for raids. Friends rolled into pvp server and i didnt know better. Regret it much. Now wanna do a transfer but still in discussion stage. I have yet to do a single AV or WSG on my 60 prot warrior and frost mage.
---
I bought one on Amazon without ever hearing of them before, and I haven't been happier. I destroyed my first one by spilling a giant beer all over it, but it lasted 3x as long as my Naga did before that. Happily bought another one and been using it for a few years.
---
Fack that guy!
---
I reflexively toss up nature's grasp whenever I even think I might get hit. Then just step away from the melee and hot myself. Leave 'em there to think about what they did.
---
Got two in our first three kills, still haven't seen a deathbringer yet and we do split groups for Ony.
---
Thank you to everyone replying. What fixed this for me (at least as far as I can tell is using the raw mouse input script) I could immediately tell that it was using my actual dpi which seems to be working so far!
---
I treat guild members differently than I do 4 strangers in a PuG.
---
Why are you expecting 4 people you just met to essentially each hand you 50 g because you happen to be an alchemist?  And why are the 4 other people the "greedy assholes" in this situation?
---
I had mine like week 3 of launch. Perks of being 60 early and waking up to do the 6am chest every day.
---
Hold on. Rolling the same as everyone else has literally nothing to do with supply and demand.
---
I see where you‚Äôre going with the rest and don‚Äôt agree but whether or not I roll greed is not tied to supply and demand.
---
Try the raw mouse input script listed here!
---
Alliance doesn't want to win.  They want 7 minute games.
---
Horde have to wait in long queues so they play defensively to get their moneys worth so to speak.
---
1 hour is a bad game tho. Horde want about 20-30 minutes, winning and getting all the bonus honor possible
---
Holy shit... confirmed
---
And that's where we differ.  I treat 4 strangers in a PuG as 4 members of my server's community.  They're not guildies, but they're still people and part of the community.  Do you personally know and trust every single member of your guild completely?  Then some of them are strangers too.  Just because they have the same tag as you under their name doesn't make them any better than someone you've grouped with for the first time.  
---
And that first time can turn into a second and third time once people see that you're enjoyable to group with.  I'm constantly asked to run dungeons with by non-guildies because I understand that there are people behind the avatar.  It's just 50g.  
---
If cross-server dungeon queues are ever implemented then all of that is moot, but until then I'd rather have a good time with the community on my server than get salty over potentially 50g.  
---
Maybe you can congratulate the alchemist instead, and see if they'll offer you free alchemy combines in the future.  You may or may not get 50g worth of use from the free service, but you'd have earned the goodwill of someone (and his guildy in the group and potentially others in their guild).
---
He's actually pretty accurate  
---
[Here's my FarmLog](https://i.imgur.com/wFmhMa2.png)  
---
394 wins, 50 losses. 87% win rate and there's some extra losses in there.
---
But you aren't in my guild. If all the members were in your guild, and your guild didn't already have members with the recipe, then yea there would be a decent argument to keep the recipe in the guild. 
---
Were the members of the party all in your guild? Did you intend to make them free flasks forever because of that? You realize you need to do a scholo run to the alchemy lab every time you craft these flasks right?
---
Even if you intended to offer them free flasks for life, as a warrior, I have no use for flask of distilled wisdom. But I absolutely could use the 200 G.
---
Competent alliance are playing premades. In pug AVs it‚Äôs mostly people with slow mounts and/or people not smart enough to join a premade
---
No one denies tanks take more durability damage. But it‚Äôs not nearly to the extent that you are trying to describe it. A full LBRS or UBRS is only a few gold (maybe 3) unless there‚Äôs a lot of dying. A caster will still take a solid gold in naturally occurring durability damage.
---
This isn‚Äôt the bullshit 10-25 times that was spouted previously.
---
I've heard this conspiracy theory before and it makes a ton of sense.
---
Shards aren't designed to scale their resources. They ARE the scaling mechanism. If 300 people come to the same zone, you're supposed to spin up new shards to divide the population. This both reduces load and allows you to distribute it across multiple machines.
---
But if you can't spin up new shards, the single shard becomes overwhelmed and behaves worse than private servers did.
---
Moreover, if each zone is a separate shard, a lag in one zone won't spill over into the next, because different zones can be running on different hardware. Otherwise lag would be continent-wide.
---
I‚Äôd build a campfire there for funsies.
---
Hunters shouldn‚Äôt be invited to groups for this item. It‚Äôs replaced by T1.
---
DC, NFG
---
Sounds like you play with morons. Would have been acceptable to me. Who cares, let them cry.
---
it's organic. you start with a UI mod that isn't that functionally different from stock, maybe it's just a bit smoother, and you change it gradually until it's completely unrecognizable and a confusing mess to an outsider. Or you end up so minimalist that a fresh comer would be lost without information usually provided by the stock UI.
---
The voidwalkers get spawned by eyes that aren't killed. Sounds like your hunter didn't kill the first eye, which is really weird. I've never let the first one live and would never let either live if escorting someone to king.
---
What?! Lmao. Playing good doesn‚Äôt net you an epic mount when you hit 60. Intact the only people who hit 60 and can instantly afford an epic mount are people who play the auction house. That is an entirely different skill set!
---
It...kind of is. Hand and Heart are never replaced in Vanilla for mitigation. I'm done with trinkets from a BiS perspective. 
---
I'm gonna keep collecting oddball trinkets for screwing around with, obviously, but there is no better replacement for those two.
---
It‚Äôs free ad revenue when people go to his stream to circlejerk over how supposedly dumb him and his audience is.
---
I can understand the need for conversation about how we are going to roll, and I feel like I failed there. But- the level of butthurt in the game last night and on this thread too is sorta hilarious.
---
No. He will never get one just by joining a guild. Only way this boy is getting one is by starting his own guild or running pug runs and reserving it for himself. Any established guild that recruits him now isn‚Äôt gonna give the new boy a legendary.
---
[NDui Classic](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25188-NDuiClassic.html) is life.
---
What logic?  Discussing loot etiquette before the run?  That is a wise decision.
---
Glad to hear it mate
---
Recommend everyone does
---
Any good pvp guild there? Was thinking about moving over my self.
---
True. You mean the same mounts btw?
---
But it‚Äôs just to show a point that mount speed isn‚Äôt everything. When you get where your going, you‚Äôre there.
---
Dont think so
---
Someone just brute forcing guessing passwords it looks like

You will get it back, post ticket.

---

---
You masturbate to ducktales?
---
Wanna join our Guild? You seem cool.
---
Anyone who says everyone should have rolled need are just entitled brats trying to justify their greediness. The game's looting system is easy enough to interpret. If you NEED something, NEED it. If you want gold, GREED it. This whole logic of "everyone can benefit from the gold so everyone should need" is just people thinking they should have a chance to get something that benefits someone else. What if all items were BoE? People would never gear up by legitimately finding gear. Everyone would just need, sell gear, buy what they need. The game would be a disaster and people who had the RNG gods on their side would prosper. 
---
This extends to profession drops as well. You trained the profession, it's not your fault they didn't. You're entitled to have a first preference on drops supporting that profession. I'd expect an alchemist to roll for recipes and I expect to have the same courtesy for blacksmithing plans. It's just common sense. Anyone arguing differently just thinks they should be entitled to AH profits.
---
Mark of Chosen is 1% dodge if the agil proc is permanently up. There's no other mitigation on it. In practice, it is slightly lower, because while the proc is often up, it's not \*always\* up. So, for mitigation, it falls short of both Tyranny and Heart. 
---
It \*is\* an excellent blend of stats, so it's a very good trinket worth keeping, but but it is not mitigation BiS.
---
For raids, this is true.
---
In dungeons, there is a lot more competition for hunters.
---
No, that is not what is happening at all and your reply further proves my point. 
---
Your responses make no sense and it looks like either a child wrote then or somebody with poor English skills or somebody a bit simple.
---
Its generally kewl. But when you have run a dungeon x times for a single item and some rando lowlevel joins it for his first time, gets it, i die a little inside.
---
And these fkers druids/shamans that keep rolling for stuff they clearly arent using atm for their hybridbuilds/futurebuilds etc. That makes me a tad mad; like you are a dps atm; you dont need healing or tanking gear atm.
---
Then there is the occasional ninjas. Fack those ppl. Accidently missclick, oh sorry i read wrong blabla; that shit boils my blood. They are rare thou, thank god.
---
Lastly the entitlment on some ppl are just beyond. Like, tag along or getout; sure you deal good dps, tank or whatever; but im sure as hell not going to pay extra for your presence. but yeah its generally kewl.
---
I think you‚Äôre missing out on the joke lol. It‚Äôs lighthearted teasing that he partakes in too.
---
Abuse pathing as much as possible.  Clear that whole first area while leaving a melee mob up and just run different paths around the fountains and side walls with the mob chasing you.  You'll learn how to screw with their pathing and give you a little more breathing room.  
---
Minor Speed enchant on boots also gives you 8% runspeed, which is no joke so if you don't have that, I'd get it ASAP.
---
Take it and use it right there so they can see. People are skeptical about people that need recipes. That said, even on expensive shit roll need if you need. People might be mad but fuck them, learning the recipe has way more merit then selling it for gold. I cant imagine anyone faulting you
---
Once Arathi Basin comes out, you'll see many Horde jump to that as their primary BG and queues for AV will get longer.
---
The AH cost includes realistic projected profit. If they were significantly cheaper than the projected profit then the demand would increase and so would the price. If they were much more expensive no one would buy them, demand would decrease and the price would drop.
---
So the fellow you replied to is correct that the BoE is worth the same to you as it is to everyone else. Giving a specific person priority because of class/profession is a courtesy, but not based on real increase in utility etc.
---
In your situation you were fine to roll need because loot rules had not been set, and everyone should roll need on BoEs to avoid this exact situation.
---
&gt;  go farm or Gank 
---
that's exactly why you can't que from anywhere. If you could, every server would revert to the P2 stage with the world being a gankfest
---
Forgot to censor your rank GG account
---
Herblore?
---
What you fail to count here, is the high chance to get against an Alliance premade, that finishes the game in 7 minutes (or less), killing Drek, while Horde kills only Bali and 4 lts.
---
Such a game will end up with Horde getting 900 honor or even less, depends how good is the Alliance premade.
---
So, whatever you math is, does not apply in reality. It did applied in the first 2 days, but not now.
---
Facing a 7 min loss for 900 honor, after 20 min queue, or a 30 min win for 3.7k honor after 20 min queue...I am sorry, but the Horde will ALWAYS choose to turtle.
---
Simple math, really : 900 honor in 27 min or 3.7k honor in 50 min.
---
Sell it for 1k gold :)
---
Well the problem is IF the people in your own faction is actually trying to win but they arent. Theyre out there fishing, killing harpies, or afking in the cave. They dont care if they win or lose, so its not surprising that people would want to do everything possible to avoid the slackers.
---
Tried on private servers and failed miserably. It‚Äôs a really, really bad idea.
---
For the alchemist its worth a few hundred gold as he can buy it for a few hundred gold. Seriously, its not that complicated
---
Cant stop the crabbssss
---
I had no idea this was available. Blizzard don't advertise this enough.
---
So you expect the 4 members of the party to treat you like their guildy and just give you 50 g each essentially. But they are the greedy dicks for not doing it. 
---
The price is 200 g on my server. Its 50 g each, which is a lot. If "it's just 50 g" and you need this item so badly, why the fuck haven't you bought it yet?
---
If you were at all fair in your view on this, you would realize that everyone in your group needs gold and the fair and nice thing to do is to all roll on the item.   Then in future runs with that group, you will also have equal shots at other high value items. 
---
There is no way an alchemist is going to be willing to do free crafts for life when it requires an hour run through scholo each time. I don't care how nice you are pretending to be.
---
Somehow, you getting the exclusive rights to the item is a community courtesy to you that you expect from people you just met.
---
Find out if your guild posts warcraft logs, click around in there and look at what you do. Then you can open another tab with a Good holy paladin and look at what he does. Compare your gear, enchants, casts and talents and write down what you should work on for next raid.
---
Yeah you need to have not corrupt leadership. I'm rogue class lead and I have the least rogue gear out of our raiding rogues. I gave our pvp ranker priority on t1 8/8 for example. All the other rogues (5 of us total), including our GM, have 5-6/8 (i have 4 xD). We all have t2 helm, and as rogue class lead I gave all the other rogues t2 helm before i gave it to myself. We have had a binding drop that we unanimously gave to our MT. Eye of sulfuras we gave to our 1 ret paladin. We try to be as fair to our raiders as we can. Loot council can work very well, just have to not have corrupt leaders.
---
I play on pagle. Pretty solid community (ally side).
---
You would do shoulders/legs for the set bonus and keep SGC
---
Why does ratio matter on a pve server?
---
Can't be done.
---
Thanks!
---
I'm not sure that they've announced that TBH.
---
Timing when que
---
True dat
---
It wouldn't hurt, the warrior can grab one or two extra while the mage does their thing with the 4 or 5 mobs they usually pull.
---
Really? At the start of bfa we had 10 man raid groups looting anchor weed
---
&gt;Think about the amount of negativity you just put out into the world before you start repeatedly calling someone else a cunt on Reddit maybe
---
Alreadytaken put the negativity into the world.  He has acted like a cunt up and down this post; all I did was say as much in case he wasn't aware.  If someone is wearing a red shirt and I point him out I'm not creating extra red shirts.
---
you technically *can* get better water, both from AV and Argent Dawn but yes it is quite a bit more expensive than 1g/120
---
bro this concept is insane esp if linked with immersion. I think you may eb able to get support to develop further if it was an interest to you.
---
I have never done voice acting before but would be up for giving this a go I bet it wouldn't be hard to find others to.
---
I mean this MC is different compared to vanilla. The gear and talents are much better in classic compared to how it was back in vanilla when warlock gear still had agility.
---
I think your comment is valid to other arguments about people complaining about the PvP state, but this guy isn't lying you have to play a lot to get that. You have to put all your free time for the most part.
---
?? Why? Arms is superior in dungeons for tanking.
---
You don't?
---
Horde don‚Äôt turtle to make Alliance angry, they turtle because the math changed as their que have gotten longer.  For them, slower games where you kill everyone a couple times and then win is better honor farming.
---
It's a mixed bag. Some pieces you'll get flak from others. And there are a LOT of dps warriors, rogues and hunters out there. 
---
Druid healing gear, on the other hand...healing leather is basically just us and maaaaybe paladins? And there are not many druids. You can get a lot of stuff in MC/Ony pretty easy.
---
You'll learn along the way. Read class guide for whichever class you decide on. Dungeon healing is fun. Raid healing can get boring at times.
---
Open with 2h, build threat, swap to shield.
---
&gt;lol you're calling me a detriment for not farming gold.
---
No?  I both think you don't need epic mounts before stepping into AV and also that you're a cunt.  They are not mutually exclusive thoughts.
---
IDKWYSS...
---
Longest grind in the game???
---
My anger forge running ass with SGC would disagree.
---
I‚Äôd disagree. However, I‚Äôd have the common courtesy to let you know I was rolling on healing gear. Feral for me is just the fastest way to 60. I may even switch to resto before 60.
---
Dude you're putting me down because I didn't no life it in a game. Think about that for a second.
---
*25min ques now.
---
If you're playing without 2-factor authentication in 2019 then you're 100% a dumbass.
---
I've seen a few VK drop, won one em too, saw a few back in Vanilla.
---
I have never, ever, seen Brutality Blade drop, in classic or my 2 years of raiding in Vanilla.
---
=(
---
Sure but your tanks are gonna die real fast in greens.
---
The xp splits yes but a warrior would have a much easier time rounding up the mobs which would make mage's life much easier. Also if they're killing mobs who flee warrior can take out potential runners as well as take on those who resist frost nova for example.
---
If players know what to do it's always going to be faster to level in a group. Downtime for drinking/corpse running adds up on the way to 60 and two people in a party significantly lower that time.
---
20-35 mins is enough time to get somewhere to gank.  We ended up doing this in Vanilla, when my ex BF was grinding to grand marshal. 
---
Not to mention, I died 5-6 times on the way to BRD from Thorium Point on Sunday as if it was Phase 2, going to help my friend farm HoJ.  After the 2nd or 3rd death, I noted in guild chat that the Horde must have Queues. It certainly wasn't a 10 man roving death squad, but It's hard to get by a warrior and two rogues. 
---
Also, as alliance in Vanilla we had to put up with long queues, so I don't feel sorry at all. We also just dealt with it. 
---
Commit to ranking, or don't.
---
Lol you're contradicting yourself but whatever man. Maybe you're still turkey drunk from christmas.
---
&gt; Sounds like you need 4 people to spend 15 minutes to make a flask for you. Sounds like an hour to me.
---
Does time work differently for you?  WTF?  
---
And "it's nearly impossible" isn't an issue if you have a friends list of people that are helpful and friendly because you were helpful and friendly to them (aka, my argument above).  I also wasn't talking about just free flasks.  Alchemy = more than just flasks.
---
That's just selfish.
---
Just follow the tank, you dont need to know jack about dungeon layout when youre a healer. In raids just follow the other healers.
---
Learn which rank of your spells are most efficient to heal with so you dont go oom.
---
Be aware if you get healing aggro on a ranged mob when the tank is pulling, sincs theyre ranged they wont move up, its your job to LoS the mobs so they move up ti the tanking position and the tank can grab aggro.
---
Ah, didn't know they did.  Good to know.  Is it worth making multiple ranks of mana gems or just a citrine and have dark/demonic runes?
---
The way through the back is never used for PUGs, maybe one or two but it's wall jumping and not exactly straightforward to coordinate the entire raid to do so
---
Correct. Ah ok thanks.
---
Wow, that's crazy! We've gotten 5-6 brut blades in 13 weeks I think
---
Find a tank thats good to you and be his best friend - as a healer you and the tank are who controls the group. dps are dime a dozen.
---
For now that's true, but after the most hardcore players rank out it wouldn't be nearly as bad if WSG/AB were still better honor and AB released. I reached r14 in vanilla while holding a full time 9-5 job purely because i started my grind in 2016.
---
From what I understand the ad revenue is relatively minimal on sites like Twitch and Youtube.
---
Yep, we wait 20+ minutes for queue, so it's crucial to win for max honor, alliance just need to do what we were doing with short queues and get quick honor from LT's and take the loss
---
15 minutes * 4 people  = 1 hour of man time that you are demanding to get a flask crafted . 
---
Even with a blossoming friend's list, you will never be able to guarantee that you will have 4 people ready and willing to run scholo and craft a flask for you whenever you need.
---
*If I were in your guild* 
---
I.e. your guildy alchemist should also be able to roll need on recipes and make things for raids. And if he did roll need, then made you flasks for your raids with mats from the gbank I bet you wouldn‚Äôt complain.
---
Again that is what is not happening at all. With every reply you are further showing your poor read comprehension or that you are indeed a bit simple.
---
For the alchemist, yes indeed it is,
---
Just recently quit classic wow as this game is filled with a bunch of greed ridden nerds. Peace.
---
Thunderclap gets better once you rank it up some (once it lasts longer then 20 seconds) I wouldn't really bother with it before then.
---
Most important thing is to set your raid targets to easy hit hotkeys. I use f1 f2 f3 for skull, X, moon.
---
Charge&gt;defensive stance&gt;blood rage&gt;demo shout&gt;revenge whenever you can and sunder when you can't.
---
Get two revenges and or sunders on skull, switch to x and repeat, go through all the mobs. Use taunt if someone pulls aggro.
---
Mostly I just use skull and x and dont really bother with moon (thats for the cc target) but it helps once your higher or if your a bit under leveled for a dungeon.
---
I guess servers are so different. It would take about 2 months on mine. The recipe can be had for 700g and profits a minimum of 10g a day.
---
A festivus for the rest of us
---
Again, either you think I'm a detriment because of the mount or you're in this thread just to waste your time?
---
Yes, sherlock. But that‚Äôs only marginally better than having drake Paul drinks with pvp chest/leg
---
I can‚Äôt understand getting that into WoW econ that you‚Äôd need to use an addon like TSM
---
It's better than having to do a boring premade for max honor, get rid of premades and i'm totally fine with wsg being the meta
---
How to upload images correctly: Don't use imgur. Imgur is not Reddit. Imgur is a separate website that requires its own account.
---
The legs aren‚Äôt added to the game until phase 6.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22672/sentinels-plate-legguards
---
Yes our guild already has flask crafters. One of them purchased all the recipes when he hit 60 a week after release. The other did get to roll need on the recipe in some guild runs. But we wouldn't have expected a pug to just let him have it. In that case we would have all rolled the same and the guildies may or may not have gifted it to him if they won, or sold it at a cheap price.
---
soulkeeper with spirit enchant weapon spawn on your evo macro is bis I believe.
---
And the windfury problem is entirely solved by rolling alliance. Blessing of Kings works just fine.
---
Correct, wsg premades are dumb af, get rid of those and wsg is "pvp" again
---
‚ÄúI mean‚Äù has got to be the most annoying fucking thing of 2019.
---
Fuck off with your I mean.
---
Not at all, it goes to them because nobody in their eight mind would give them real top tier wpns. Its very good for a warrior and its very good for pal/shaman but since the sham/pally do 130 dps anyway u let them spend the 10k gold, it doesnt help the raid much no matter who it goes to.
---
Like others have say‚Äôd, you‚Äôll learn along the way. Definitely recommend it. I‚Äôve been healing since WotLK (basically when I learned to play) and something in it just pulls me back to it always.
---
He's not my cup of tea, but one of his fans said something along the lines of "he's basically the WWE for wow."  That made it easier to understand his appeal
---
You're just weakminded.
---
Yeah, I put too much faith into the system. Only the devs really know how the numbers develop. (as long the ratio of detected and undetected bots is somewhat stable, they can tell how their policies affect them.
---
If you've every played a moba(league, dota, smite, hots, etc) then you know the mindset of alliance players in AV.  
---
1 death/wipe that's isn't that detrimental and can easily enough be come back from, salvaged or however you wanna word it. Is instead blown out of proportions and the team spends more time in chat, blaming everyone else instead of trying and playing the game anymore.

yep. and for giggles I lvled engineering and really only use guns so I have never had to buy ammo since I just make my own.
---
Are you saying the Arcanite Transmute recipe is 500-600g?
---
Do you even know how many members of your guild have this recipe? If 10 alchemists already have it, the argument that you are bringing utility back to your guild or community completely falls apart.
---
Yeah cuz 2 day av's are so cool amiright
---
Was stuck using trash blade for 5 days of gametime after 60, Rend mh refused to drop. I kill rag and get a perditions blade, next 2 ubrs back2back had rend mh drop...
---
It's a good server, just no ally.    Which doesnt mean much....   BG's are running and the top horde guild in the world is here, so they have alts ally side with war effort mats.    Come play with your friends, hit me up if you want more friends.

-Molson
---
&gt;15 minutes * 4 people = 1 hour of man time that you are demanding to get a flask crafted .
---
No.  Just no.  
---
That's why you craft more than one... I currently have 20 in my bank.  "Hey guys, I need to craft a few flasks come help?"  "Sure, let me grab mats for mine too"  "Ok!"
---
You're right, it's not that hard. So why is it you don't see that profit off of a recipe is part of that value?
---
Gz!

SAFE SPOTTING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Stop with the strawman baiting, there is no accurate data to tell actually how many people play now who were there in 2006...

well it depends, you got the DM buffs, the ony/rend buffs, firewater, elixir of mongoose, food buff, the buffs from songflower serenade. weapons you got the sharpening stones. or windfury on MH if you're horde. You also have in combat ones like battle chicken/whelping and thistle tea
---
Because PuG games are mostly emulating premade group strategies, but the first and foremost reason that premade strategies work is having an overwhelming majority of players move around as a pack and go after the same objective, *at the same time*. Most PuG games can't even achieve consensus at the first fork out of the gate, then players split into 2-3 groups and get intercepted. With less than 10 players reaching Galv it will easily be a wipe if Horde players decide to show up. Then comes the quitters who immediately leave the game and cause the team to scatter even further.

I currently play a priest, lvl 56 disc/holy for healing. I find it relatively easy. Make sure everyone is topped up, job done.
---
I have grid and healium for healing add-ons.
---
My issue due to lack of experience, is mana efficiency. In prolonged fights I run oom half way.

I only run 5 man so far so it's not the end of the world, but someone here can probably teach us both üôÇ

i played throughout beta and vanilla, dabbled a bit in bc/wotlk, but was afraid to play classic cause of how addicted i got to vanilla back in the day. a couple months after classic launch i bit the bullet and started, but it's just too hard for me to play nowadays - took me a week to hit level 10.
---
at that point i figured i only have time to do handful of quests a week, i've already lived through all this shit 100 times years ago, and i won't be able to play enough to compete in any endgame content, so i just deleted the game and live vicariously through y'all on the sub.

I don‚Äôt remember making a community courtesy argument.

Are you talking about the comment I made on having the discussion at the start of the dungeon?

Nah I made one popular addon back in the day, otherwise just using it for small tweaks or weakauras.

If youre Orc, dont bother with the Axe of Deep Wounds, just get the AV axe @ revered.

Because it would kill the concept of being stealth. All you who have to do is spam alt tab and any instant cast like corruption to catch rogues, it would be too easy. You seeing the rogue could only mean that your character heard some footsteps. 
---
If it was kinda like dnd. He would have failed his stealth check and you would know he's around but to spot his exact location you must succed a perception check a.k.a. click on him before he dissapear.

None of them do

Use honorspy
---
Of course a premade is not going to bother defending against a small group, it's not worth to extend the game even longer.

Yeah you need to learn to read.

That‚Äôs true for all tanks on alliance tho. Horde has it harder regardless of whether you‚Äôre a warrior or Druid tank in a raid

I'd argue that anyone getting priority on an item (BoE) only benefits the individual (not as selfish).  Even in a closed server, I doubt those players will seek out the specific individual they were with when a flask recipe dropped.  Even if they did, I speculate that they would tip or be charged for their efforts.  If this is a guild run, yes, absolutely give it to someone who will use it in an effort to progress the guild.
---
It simply doesnt benefit you more than the tailor to have it at any price, free or not. It's value is equal to all. We have established this already. 
---
Your failure to grasp basic economics is creating an impasse in this discussion now.
---
This is why I wouldn't mind getting WotLK as a server option eventually, but would only play it if they remove the dungeon finder.
---
I can think of a million ways for this to happen.
---
If you think code is always airtight and perfectly linear, you've presumably never gone beyond hello world programs. The order of execution can change function to function, an overlooked call can set off a chain reaction. 
---
My best guess is that some edge case occurred and called a function to swap layers, and depending on how things actually work under the hood could have instantiated a new layer upon finding just one.
---
Healing is the easiest job to do. Its ridiculously easy. All you have to focus on is not overhealing.
---
Why is hit a meme?
---
&gt;I'd take 20 min ques all day over spamming AV with premades literally every second of the day without having time to take a shit.
---
You miss  a game from time to time, just not ending up in everyone else's AV. You use those 10mins to take the shit.
---
lol his kill times are good, you only have mana issues on 2:30+  fights. My guild has similar kill times and we clear MC in 1h30mins, 2 or 3x faster would be top 0.1% speedrun clear times with shit tons of consumables and buffs
---
You honestly think it's preposterous to assume that tank gear goes to tanks, damage gear goes to dds and healing gear goes to healers?
---
Felhunter does less dps so unless you are fighting caster mobs it's not worth it.
---
You are delusional. Horde had it good everywhere and cry when any Alliance gathered a raid to stomp a zone for like 20-minutes.
---
Saw that reguarly with the Fire Elementals just South of there. I'd run up to one, start casting, and then it'd disappear midcast.
---
avaialble gear with similar people were justdumb and stacking intellect and mana regen effects  instead of spell power tbh
---
Good point.
---
Dodge block and parry are all increased with defense. The higher those are, the smaller the chance for a crushing blow while SB is on cooldown, which it will be a lot. 10 defense amounts to a 1.2% less chance of being crushed during your cooldown, which is noticable in making damage more consistent.
---
At 300 rep/game, it takes about 140 games to complete the AV rep grind. Now, it's possible to get more rep in some games, depending on how much you're winning, but for the average bear, AV does take a little bit. 
---
It is far, far easier than WSG, though. If you always lost at WSG, it would take 971 wins. 
---
Human slightly less for either.

Witty retort mon ami.

Does crafting a Goblin Mortor have a higher chance to backfire and kill you if it's an old Mortor you've recrafted 5+ times already? I've gotten 4 backfires on my last  5 recrafts and I can't tell if I'm just super unlucky or not.

Grobb is very even, probably the most. But if you are worried about wpvp don't be, it's dead with Bgs out. If you are worried about economy/pugs, you can't go wrong with Faerlina or Herod since they have huge pops. But I play horde side grobb and I've had an absolute blast.
---
Is Kevin reference?
---
I mostly tank dungeons but fill heals or dps if the party really can't find one.  Of course it helps if everyone in the party knows the dungeon, knows their class, etc. But healing in and of itself in vanilla isn't very challenging.  The way to improve ( and you will ) is simply knowledge of your class,  your partys classes, and of the enemies abilities.  
---
Just make sure someone in the party knows where to go,  and you'll be fine ;) if someone flames you for making a mistake, they're overreacting. Classic is my first time in vanilla instances and I've tanked and healed all the end game dungeons with MANY mistakes and many wipes. You just laugh it off and try again.

Sooooo, big plays vs incremental plays.  Doesn‚Äôt change anything about what I said.
---
Remember for the alliance with no ques, winning isn't the point.  Most of us are already exalted and are only playing for honor now.  Winning only provides the bonus honor of winning and you get the honor for taking the towers/graveyards/LT in the first place.  Also we can just que up again instantly, no reason to prolong the game.
---
It's starting to happen more in games. I think people who are done with the rep grind or honestly just bored are becoming more common. Those players are more likely to run around looking for fun and I've had tons of small 3v3 ish fights at bunkers while the rest of the bg is reenacting WWI tactics.
---
Just unlucky.
---
Imagine a scenario - something worth X gold drops. Player A says "with that gold I can but a new recipe". Players B-E say they have stuff to buy as well.
---
The end result is the same as OP's scenario, just with an extra step. Regardless of what the players do with the gold, the drop is equal to X, the AH price
---
The items will be added in p3 anyway
---
Lol when did I claim to care about pvp? I‚Äôm in it for the rewards asap. I care about pve and nothing else. Bgs are a necessary evil till I get what i need.
---
Yep. And you have to be in the area just past the bugs and the hunter needs to kill boss as south west as possible to be eligible for loot
---
The problem is that now anyone who wants to rank HAS TO farm AV. Its even worse for the alliance since they have no queues, they litteraly can't stop for hours.
---
oh my bad, I get people nonsense mixed in.
---
still, glad we agree both of you are spouting nonsense.
---
If I needed a 100% mount in AV the quartermaster would require one before joining the queue. Sounds like you're just mad
---
My druid bought the Stormpike Charger for 640g, plus the healing and arcane damage offhands for 40g apiece at exalted.
---
Not hard at all.  I just think it's a pointless metric when talking about how long it takes to do a dungeon.  Be honest here, when have you ever told someone that you wouldn't want to run a dungeon due to "the collective man hours required to complete it".  Or did you just use it specifically for this discussion.
---
Most of the server discords are probably run by people of a similar disposition.

Enjoy, I guess.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs childish is the people who play the game 16 hours a day for 3 months straight to get r14 in a game that‚Äôs 15 years old. Don‚Äôt get upset for me saying the truth. Of course the honor system blows but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre talking about here
---
oh boy, you'll enjoy playing a tank if you ever roll one.
---
This has been my experience too. If you‚Äôre cool you‚Äôll constantly have people adding you to their groups, so your chances of eventually getting the drops you need to up. But that ninja is going to eventually get blacklisted.
---
Yeah, losing loot rolls sucks, especially when it‚Äôs your current BiS drop and it‚Äôs their offspec drop. Back in TBC I ran Old Hillsbrad until my eyes bled trying to get the pre-raid tanking ring for my Druid, and the one time it finally dropped a fury warrior from my guild needed and won ‚Äúbecause it had armor on it.‚Äù
---
Let‚Äôs just say there was a couple times while we were raiding that I waited a few more seconds than normal to taunt when he pulled aggro, but I wasn‚Äôt a *complete* jerk about it, lol.
---
No. Nor do I think it's preposterous for tank gear to go to non-tanks, damage gear go to non-damage dealers, and healing gear to go to non-healers.
---
Like I said, if you're after something specific, discuss loot in advance. If you join a group, just ask if loot rules are main spec over off spec, if you start the group, just make loot rules. Pretty simple.
---
Diminishing returns take 1 kill to hit. At 4 kills, your kills gives is 0 honor. 4 kills happen quite often if your defending/attacking the same groups.
---
And this is why we can't have nice things.
---
Agreed, this was a bunch of unfinished fights.
---
Grats! I had a similar attachment to the staff, bought mine at 45 for 100g in the first few weeks
---
Yup, every game they just burn through our objectives they get out with 3.5k minimum.  It‚Äôs only the games they‚Äôre porting into their base 10 at a time that I see them below 3k.
---
I had this and fixed it by opening a stuck ticket. There‚Äôs two options, the first uses your hearthstone but that didn‚Äôt work. There‚Äôs a second option which is harder to find where they make you log off and you get an email when you can log back in again. Only takes two min and you‚Äôre back good to go.
---
You rolled need after you waited on everyone having responded to a drop on a boe that is worth same to everyone gold wise.
---
That is a ninja. You dont need to convince yourself and everyone else to make yourself feel better and call others idiots. People were naive to roll greed amd trust others to do same but the general ettiquet is to either reroll after or discuss it since it is tradable and benefits everyone equally.
---
But going through yoyr response i get that you are just denying and trying to rationalize your ninja so it is not your fault at all. I would ignore list and stay away from your grouping if I ever did group with you, altho I declare everyone roll need before dungeons
---
why do you think they are mad? They created a system allowing them to get quick and efficient win while you're struggling, most likely losing, against horde pug.
---
there's only one person mad here, and he's using caps.

For BoE's this is respectable logic, as long as everyone is on the same page.

Average premade game is like 20 minutes. Either win in  15 on the first push or lose a GY and then push back to win or lose the race in 30.

I'm exalted and I've seen this happen exactly twice

Looking at it now and it says "Binds when used"

You can follow that as some sort of code for yourself if you want, but if you expect strangers to know your unspoken rules, you're going to have a bad time.

Something doesn‚Äôt have to income related to be real.
---
As you‚Äôve found with your GF, many people have emotional investments in the game, for better or worse.  These investments come from friends/family, social interactions, nostalgia, ect. 
---
Regardless about anything else, you‚Äôre disrespectful of others with an attitude of ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt real, so why does it matter‚Äù.  Why does it matter?  As with most things that matter, it matters because of the emotion and time.
---
Closer to 100%
---
I liked everything about it except the Horde side quest to kill 15 Moonkin Savages or w/e they are called. And there are literally 7 spawn locations for the mob in the whole zone.
---
I'm one bar into Exalted and the idea of doing that for 10 more hours is painful. Might as well grind gold for 2 hours to make up the difference.
---
The games I am talking about 10-15 horde get wiped at galv... then get wiped again at Frostwolf, then again time and time again at Relief hut. Honor spy does a half way decent job of telling you how much honor you are really getting from each kill as well as how many times you have killed that person. 
---
If you actually calculated the xp/h of what you were actually getting for honor then you would see how much time you were wasting. 
---
Sure it is worth it to solo kill out in the fields the alliance running back so you dont have to share much or maybe even any honor for your kill, but that isn't what horde are mainly doing and that doesn't extend the games.
---
It's still combat spec. Most of the time the decision between dagger/sword is based purely on what weapons you have access to. I'm not going to equip worse weapons for how ever many raids and wait for Perd's to drop.
---
But the poster waitwd until everyones response to roll need on a boe. That aling with posters response this thread leads me to believe he is a ninja looking to justify his actions (and calling others idiots). 
---
Common courtesy leads me to believe it being called for reroll or discussion of loot after said looting due to nature of boe. Op seems to be self serving person who is trying to rationalize it
---
The problem is you can get 3500 honor for a 10 minute game if you don‚Äôt go balls out defending.  The only games I see the horde fail to get as much or more honor are those where they commit nothing to offense and are getting the bunkers backcapped.
---
I got a ton of cute nerd matches in tinder by just putting, "really just looking for a healer (or a tank, its 2019)
---
It‚Äôs all on average. If a flask recipe drops 10 times, let‚Äôs say 2 alchemists get it for free. The rest have to buy it. Hypothetically the average price for the recipe on AH is 500g, then across the 10 possible flask makers they‚Äôre starting out (as a group) at -4000g. This sets an **unnecessary** floor on prices, and it only goes up from there. 
---
Like this: Now these guys farm or buy mats, and they make their flasks. They price it with the fact they‚Äôre (on average) in the negative. Now consider those who sell herbs are seeing their stock get bought up and the realize they can charge more. So then they charge more, but the flask makers still need to earn their cut to get out of the red, so prices go up again (and those who got the recipe for free aren‚Äôt going to buck this trend). As we all progress through BWL and AQ, demand for flasks won‚Äôt slow down, so price goes up again. 
---
So what happens? People form socialist little groups of discounted trading and gifting of materials and recipes for the greater good (i.e. guilds, which is a point you made). 
---
All this could be (largely) avoided if we just respected the utility provided by a profession and ignoring the BoE price for ‚Äúselfish‚Äù (economically) short term gains. 
---
This is basically the Nash Equilibrium but it‚Äôs too complex to see in the heat of the moment during a loot drop. Instead, if we all understood that ‚Äúlet all alchemists roll need on flasks and we will all get cheaper flasks forever‚Äù, this whole ‚Äúroll need for expensive items‚Äù bullshit will stop.
---
thanks dude , you finding priest fun?
---
I would also like to know how to land on it lol
---
I had this happen. You're actually alive but it bugged out. I'm guessing you have that auto-release in PvP enabled. Unfortunately this need a full game restart. So Alt + F4 so that the game just thinks your DC'ed and load up again. It shouldn't kick you from the BG and you'll be actually alive. I suggest disabling the auto-release in PvP.
---
I think they can be traded because awhile back I saw someone in trade chat trying to sell their turquoise raptor because they accidentally bought two lol

I looked it up.

Alliance controlled DM and WPL 80%+ of the time. Even early morning. I woke up at like 7 server to try and even then they had control.
---
Yah you‚Äôre right, I was more speaking generally. 
---
But uh yeah bonus story: the first place I worked at handled deletion *exactly* like this. They handled data for TD bank, Merck Animal Labs, and more. It‚Äôs amazing how many bad legacy systems are utilized by big names.

lol imgur wants me to make an account to look at that. nah fuck them.

Played on in vanilla through Cata, along with a priest. Have both now.  I have experience on both sides. Clearly you do not, instead opting to regurgitate ignorance as if it were true.

Right so world buffs aside, the items I need to keep stocked are food buffs, Mongoose potions, sharpening stones, and poisons? (Not including restorative, gfp, free action, etc)?

Is it common to swap out the helm after you transform, for that extra min max?

You‚Äôre saying good players can only be players who joined the game months ago and cant be newer players just hitting 60 now or recently, not even on alts? Wtf is wrong with your brain.

10.000 Honor a day would be very low on my realm not even bracket 5. Google it and use honor spy
---
Whoosh
---
From my experience doing premades. It seems that it‚Äôs more about honor per hour than winning. No one cares if we lose a game that lasts 15 mins. They just want the game over with a fast as possible. The only way to piss off a premade is 100% turtle and not winning the game yourself.
---
As someone who doesn't consider emotions to be valid in an argument, gotta say you aren't swaying me. Guess we'll agree to disagree then.
---
Scallop lord sun god lezonta
---
Holy shit, the rows and rows of fucking bottles. That would drive me nuts.
---
Dbm is available to everyone, 40 man premades are not. You played yourself.
---
Half the intended population is just gone haha, but I promise we‚Äôre fine!!
---
&gt;Horde pug vs Alliance premade seems to be a balanced matchup with 50% winrate on EU.
---
Not my experience. I think we have  more than 95% winrate.

It's from the elevators there, if I remember right sort of between them.  Not the elevators by the Barrens, the ones by the town.

I knew I wanted to include a croc of some sort, but I hit a bit of a snag when I realized that the boat went to Theramore and not Ratchet, which meant that Gorak had to take a bit of a swim ^^

Take up an entire trinket slot down to the worth of a 12s pot with a 2 minute cooldown compared to 20. If this heap of shit was blue, nobody would even consider it.
---
Used to be common sense, but seems not as common anymore .
---
At the end of the day it's a pvp server and casuals get bracketed out. /end
---
Your brightness setting on max there bud?
---
Wpvp is dead in general but even moreso on an imbalanced server, Skeram is supposed to be the worst one so I wouldnt expect any wpvp at all or it will be very very sparse.  
---
If you primarily want to pve with casual pvp sprinkled in and wpvp. Find a more balanced server, even something like 60:40 H:A and roll alliance there.  
---
Its important you roll alliance btw, because that way youll have instant bg queues. Currently AV queue lasts around 20 minutes with wsg taking even longer. I dont really see it improving over time either for the horde, so yeah. Go alliance if you want to pvp.
---
Luci in sub 30 seconds is top 0.1% ? I mean come on now ...
---
yeahhh that was some bull
---
Love how you guys are pushing people to roll ally now because you fucked faction balance so hard.
---
Hurt people on my own faction losing to a 40 man alliance premade in 7 minutes? No.
---
i meant i wouldn‚Äôt wear a tank set, i would just blast through it in dps plate.
---
Fair enough but everyone SHOULD roll need in that case to avoid these situations and because it‚Äôs high value. How I see it though is he will actually learn the recipe and already has 300 alchemy so he can use it straight away. The point you made about reimbursing the other players is a good idea though.
---
Please watch some og naxx videos on youtube, those people suck really hard and their dps is similar to what we do in MC currently
---
Can I come with you on the next run?
---
Idk about the actual stats, but I‚Äôm alliance on Grob.
---
Lvl 37 priest and in STV right now. I feel like I‚Äôve seen slightly more horde than alliance running around. But I feel like that‚Äôs always the case in STV. 
---
I‚Äôve been ignored by horde but have also been attacked by some of them. Haven‚Äôt had any issues with them camping or grieving me though, so that‚Äôs nice.
---
HealComm comes into play in UBRS and raids.
---
For raid frames I recommend Grid2, player/target frames Shadowed Unit frames, and Google your class of choice + mouseover heal macros and set those up. Or use Clique instead of mouseovers, but then it's one extra add-on rather you are dependent on rather than just setting up a few macros that will work forever.
---
I want to play in pugs, I hate premades, but how are you supposed to rank if the top 150 spots (i.e. down until bracket 9) are camped by the premade guys? I'm forced to do it as well, no matter how much I hate it.
---
Gz! :3
---
Yes that is the common procedure but what op is describing is breakdown of the said common procedure and miscommunication but it wad very clear that the intent of the group was to have everyone roll need on it and response after clearly shows that.
---
If op was really looking to solve the issue, he would have offered to reroll. Hoeever, he is here on reddit calling them idiots and made no effort to resolve this. I wouldnt trust him in any raid setting myself if he was handling loot
---
People are interested in his take on things
---
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt premade, do ya?
---
Which even further supports that if a guild can clear MC bosses in minutes, they probably can make DPS checks in BWL. The whole point was saying they might have bad DPS for BWL is nonsensical since people used to frequently take upwards of 10mins a fight in MC and then continue to do the same in BWL. When fights take only a minute or two, the issue wont be DPS, itll be threat management.
---
Kala is a bit more chill and infrequent than the other mentioned, but I like him.
---
MC BoE's sell for like 250-500g each...    How can anyone think that any guild would consider selling Azuregos for 700g..   Maybe 7000g....  But even then I know my guild wouldn't consider taking 7000g over what is currently the hardest to obtain loot in the game...
---
Be grateful it wasn't a photo taken from the cellphone.

Get a warrior to 60.

I mean, depending on the volume of data in the table it wouldn‚Äôt even matter in some cases. Let‚Äôs say your player table has tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands of rows). Let‚Äôs say half of the rows are deleted and the other half are not. If your table is properly indexed/partitioned the lookup time difference and join difference is probably going to be in the microseconds. People forget that RDBMS are really really really super good at finding ways to make things go very fast, and that kind of problem (throwing out all the 0‚Äôs and leaving the 1 records) would probably be optimized away by your RDBMS engine without you even having to do anything or think about it. So while what GP describes is a good practice/design, the claim of a ‚Äú10000x‚Äù slowdown is frankly a very unlikely scenario until you get into the tens/hundreds of millions of rows.
---
That's debatable IMO. Ogre Forged Hauberk is good, but I still think Savage Gladiator Chain is slightly better. (many BiS guides seem to agree too since they all list the Gladiator Chain but none I've found so far lists the Hauberk). 
---
You're right though, he's probably talking about HoJ.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs the same as reserving first orb is strat live. Tanks are in demand so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an unreasonable request and if people don‚Äôt like the deal they can just wait for another tank.
---
No, people are just mad at their own stupidity. Just like those dudes who greed on dark runes in scholo and then QQ.
---
t.horde player
---
Premades are cancer for us too, they FORCE us to join one or get completely fucked on the ranking. You think everyone wants to spend their time in AV tryhard rushing in silence with some random dude on discord? You think we pvpers signed up for pvp with a 40 man pve raid?
---
Juju might is the frostmaul eko. Juju power is winterfall eko.
---
my my, I'm surprised. such easily obtained triggering.... you dont see that every day.

DPS easier
---
Or maybe try to consider the act of deserting as detrimental to the match that other 39 players are also in? Unless it's a full-40 turtle (which never happens), a coordinated push with enough players present can always resolve it.
---
I report every single deserter with screenshot if their names show up in premade discords. Have fun being kicked back to PuG hell.

I'd say 'best balanced' is a server where most players on Alliance and Horde say 'the server is balanced'.
---
Bad balance is when both sides agree that one side outnumbers the other.
---
And unplayably bad balance is when one side says the balance is horrible, and the other side says the balance is fine. Be very wary of those- that's a case of one side having such an easy time they're clueless to what the other side is going through, and we heard that one all the time on Stalagg and Skeram early on.
---
Ughh. That sucks, bud
---
Why do people post useless questions of Reddit threads?
---
Because they can. And they did, just like you and I.
---
My guild uses an rng based dkp system (dkp basically adds to your rolls). It's incredibly frustrating to see the lowest performing mages get gear because they have good rng. They also will not pass on minor upgrades even if that drop is going to be a massive upgrade for someone else. More frustrating is that they only raid log. Most frustrating is that they ALWAYS ask me what enchants to put on it.
---
I mean we gave a mage blade to someone who was fire spec until like 2 weeks ago.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm main tank for my guild. I have 110k hp SELF BUFFED. If this isn‚Äôt too intimidating for you, message me back. If it is, then it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be.‚Äù

Gotta make sure no one can identify the ironforge guards ;)

of course, of course.

it's not as if the durability system got massive change in TBC, supporting my point. you know, repair price getting even'd out and armor durability even'ing out?
---
but keep going...
---
Op is clearly being greedy here and is judt trying to justify his actions on reddit. Its clear 3/5 group rolles greed and as a boe item, it could have been discussed after again for reroll if people were disgruntled.
---
Instead, op calls them idiots and refuses to resolve this at all..
---
I wouldnt trust op with any loot related stuff in raids if i was in his guild really
---

Early 4xs is a bit annoying. The pirate questlines at STV are good, you can do some stuff in badlands and try get a group for uldaman. Once you hit 43-44, Tanaris is a perfect zone with lots of quests and a popular dungeon (ZF), which you should run at least a couple of times. At later 4x you can do hinterlands and feralas, and get into maraudon groups.
---
Win almost every game against pugs that can't even fight back.   Even the premades aren't that hard to beat.   Tell everyone to recall, and it's gg.

It‚Äôs not hard. It‚Äôs actually a lot of fun... just need someone to teach you how to heal effectively.

My math had it 1 out of 125 for SGC, so .8% really.

It can be traded and put on AH .. so yes it works
---
Oh its cancer on both parts of that, if your one premade discord the option is miss a que or bathroom break, most opt to hold it.
---
if a fight lasts 2 mins or more you can use 2 mana gem, so use 1 right after the fight start then another after 2 mins, same with mana pot.
---
Have a 2h weapon of spirit that gives you like 25 spirit or something, and switch to that when you use evocation. Each point of spirit gives you 16 mana while you  use evocation, excluding 30% from mage armor while you're fighting the boss, so get as much spirit as you can while not affecting  your gear ( food buff, scroll, potions, priest buff).
---
Or go to felwood and grind demon for an hour and get like 6-7 demonic runes ready for a raid.

I did a lot of research and there was spellpower gear at launch, it was just rarer until patch 1.4 which heavily buffed all caster gear and is very similar to 1.12 (ragnaros world first was 1.4 btw).
---
But even in 1.1 you would still have only about 30% less spellpower than in 1.4-1.12 and very few guilds were clearing molten core before 1.3 (dire maul) and 1.4 caster update...
---
Here are some exemples of 1.1 or 1.2 spell power items

Just replace the item id by the want you want to look up and you can check yourself, it's hard to find items who were archvied in late 2004/early 2005 too
---
There's also  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)  which has all the items changes but I tought you would only believe archives.
---
That kind of inflexibility isbjust lack of courtesy and a ninja.

Damn. Didn't see that one

you realize that not being hacked ever has nothing to do with luck and everything to do with me properly taking care of my email accounts and passwords right?   I mean you said blizz has been hacked before, but i haven't so it seems like as long as i keep doing what i am doing i should have nothing to worry about.  I mean hell i have had a steam account since it launched with half life 2 and its never been hacked, ever.  its really not hard.

Our guild has seen a few of theese and deathbringer, Even me as a fury prot orc warrior have one deathbringerüòÅ now the challange of getting x2 deathbringer startsüëçüèΩ
---
Always roll need on all epics is the best way to avoid drama- that includes all rare recipes.
---
Bis bis m8
---
Fair point.
---
In that case, the argument becomes:
---
DD  
---
1.2% avoidance  
---
\+10 Fire Res
---
\-vs-
---
TIO  
---
\~+300 armor  
---
\+8 Stam  
---
\+31 Block Value
---
One of the arguments for +Defense being overrated is that, in most situations, you are tanking a boss with 2.0 attack speed (a few rare exceptions). You have Shield Block which, if specced the way you should be, guarantees two non-crit, non-crushing hits on a 5 sec cooldown. Assuming good play and only tanking one mob (not always the case), you should only rarely be getting hit by a boss without Shield Block up, making you uncrittable/uncrushable most of the time -regardless- of Defense value.
---
There is also the added benefit of block value increasing your Shield Slam damage, increasing threat generation.
---
There's an argument for Defense. But I'm personally going for TIO unless I am raiding and 100% sure I'm getting my guild's next Drillborer Disk.
---
Horde can premade tho, they just have to queue up with enough people.
---
If no one should get the chance to "need" it then everyone should need, that way everyone has a 'fair' shot - if you aren't allowing need roles why even roll greed instead of all need?
---
How is the map inconvenient? Its a giant square that's all flat. Your never like "ok where do I go"
---
I am wearing T1 bracer and helm despite owning Bracers of Eclipse and T2 helm because I get my 5pc set bonus this way. When I get another piece of tier 1 I will swap my helm for my T2 helm and then another piece and will swap bracers back. IDK all of OP's gear, but they might have a similar situation going on.
---
use adibags, way better
---
Probably should have told him before the run...
---
That doesn't really work on hybrids though. 
---
Most Shamans and Druids level as Enhancement and Feral respectively because it's faster. By your logic, if they want to build healing hear they should heal on their non-healing spec even if they can DPS/tank quite well and there are other healers available?
---
Benidiction is a good balanced server.
---
Spoken from the alliance perspective.
---
Wat.  Horde is the one honor grinding, Alliance strats are to end the game quickly with decent honor, Horde takes EVERYTHING.
---
There isn't ANY running back and forth though. You grab all the quests and can knock all of them out before heading back. The only one that has a second part is the one you get in stv where you collect 20 heads.
---
Other then that its just knock out all the quests and leave. Its awesome.

Nothing is stopping you from pugging, all the power to you my friend. I don't think we should handicap those who want to do better for themselves however.

Yeah I carry a Kershaw ‚ÄúLeek‚Äù which is just a longer version. It‚Äôs a great knife and it‚Äôs cheap enough that I won‚Äôt hate myself if I lose it...or if I completely ruin it while trying to engrave.
---
Uh...no? Farming stuff in a group is common and accepted. You just like...need to inform people you're farming it. If you don't tell anyone then default for expensive BoE is all need. Which you can still win obviously.
---
The stuns are physical but the abilities should be spells. Otherwise they could be dodged, blocked or parried and they could miss. It's the same for Taunt and Thunder Clap which also run of spell hit.
---
Yah, don't do this...  This is really dumb.
---
Relog. I had this multiple times in wsg.

yeah the real issue is this shitty ass honor system lol

It‚Äôs one of the forum rules, not sure why

Dude, have fun with it. People are bitching that it's not BIS or that you overpaid for the enchant.  
---
Look, you had fun farming it.  
---
You had fun selling ports in Kargath for gold.  
---
You were ecstatic to get it enchanted.

And now you're going to have fun using it while you get 60 at your own pace.

Have fun PLAYING YOUR GAME. Cause that's what it is. A game. For fun. Great post OP

It‚Äôs nearly never bad to try and do well at something, but in wow people feel needlessly threatened by others trying.
---
I was a little late to it so I still am.  But it doesn't really matter, the Ally premade strat still wins pretty quick.
---
That's fair, I'm colored because I'm not in Alliance premades and have been run over in 10-15 minutes by Horde a fair amount this last week. I would note, I think Horde could still finish games faster than their traditional 20-30 if more people start doing the weird jump straight to the Relief hut, simply because most games Alliance gives up after failing to get Galv and has about 20 afk.
---
This just in; there's no language barrier or other evidence of chinese gold farmers in this thread.
---
Name checks out, you can roll need ü§ó
---
It's basically useless for a warrior beyond 6 (for a human or orc), which is easy to get.
---
Google Chrome remembers any passwords
---
Yeah, and if you want to ensure you get to roll against the others you should roll need, not greed. The fault didn't lie with the alchemist needing, it was the other 3 party members greeding allowing for this scenario to occur in the first place. If those 3 all had needed then there would be no way for the alchemist to bypass the fair roll. If an alcors drops in one of my runs I'd always type "everyone need" followed by needing no matter which class I am playing.
---
must be nice having warriors that will use something besides swords
---
Does Juju ember stack with other FR buffs?
---
Yeah I type all need, but if I win an item and someone greeded they can /roll to see if they beat my need roll if they want.
---
Decay means you need to grind brackets above your target to make reasonable progress.
---
Example:
---
You're at rank 1 at 0k Rank Points (RP). Your end goal is rank 10.
---
So how long for rank 10? In all, 
---
Let's say you always place 1.5 brackets above your current rank. It works out to 5 weeks per rank. That includes 5 weeks pretty high in bracket 11 to reach rank 10. On my realm the first rank 10 just hit this week with having had top spot the entire time PvP has been live.
---
So that's 50 weeks, almost a year, to reach rank 10 with progressively harder time commitments.
---
If you instead did mid-bracket 11 the entire time. You'd reach rank 10 in 8 weeks.
---
So 2 months or 12.5 months? Why do you think some people push so hard?
---
Ty
---
i have the short one like yours it cost me $7 on clearance lol got lucky there
---
What an amazing time to be alive.
---
I think actually a lot changed last few months in the playerbase. I dinged 60 about a week before DM and got my BiS in one week and never had any loot drama and people were decent players and very nice. I had like 3-4 bad experiences in total
---
Now I lvled a couple of alts to 35 and the experience on all of them is way worse. Everyone is way more rude and worse at the game.
---
AV was always crap.
---
Yep there‚Äôs a detailed guide (video)on this jump to get on SW and other places,etc.
---
It's not a strawman, it's my persona anecdote. But yeah, fuck me, I deserve queues because some other people rolled Horde for the racials.
---
Nothing is wrong with having 60% mount man, 900g is a lot of gold! But enemies with 100% can catch you. You are giving up the map advantage that AV lends you as alliance by not being able to take the objectives quickly. Have a good time out there man, and good luck
---
Stats are from [Cross Dagger] which is the first random green dagger I could find to mimic the layout.
---
well that's not the most secure solution but besides the point.
---
You're talking to another IT guy. "Google chrome remembers" doesnt solve the problem for your average idiot ya know.
---
Clearly this is true because people are commenting they can't make an account lmao
---
But that alchemy recipe if sold would buy me a tailoring recipe. So in that case, either you get an alchemy recipe or I get a tailoring recipe. In each case the one who wins the roll gains 1 recipe. So effectively the value of the recipe is pretty much the exact same for both of us (minus the 5% AH tax I suppose).
---
To add to this, I've found it helpful to have your cool down timers show, because I always CoC when it says it has 14 seconds left on nova CD because it lasts for 8 seconds. This way no mob breaks early and you can keep them nice and clumped together.
---
Then you should run a guild group where the recipe is understood to be yours if it drops or form your own group with the recipe on reserve.
---
I have no problem running a Strat live where the first RO goes to the tank as long as it‚Äôs stated beforehand.
---
I still think in a pug everyone should need roll. Leveling 300 Alchemy isn‚Äôt hard I have it on my lvl 35 Druid to make mongoose elixirs for my main.
---
However, especially right after launch, Flask of the Titans AH‚Äôd for a lot of gold, same as recipes like Lionheart Helm right now. In a pug I would not pass on either of those, but if everyone greeded I would too. I don‚Äôt think just having X as your profession should grant you the recipe by default.
---
Now let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a low value blue BoE that sells for 15-30g. If the item is a legit upgrade you will equip immediately, fine I won‚Äôt need roll on it to sell.
---
That being said I‚Äôll repeat myself, I still think everyone should need on high value BoEs.
---
Some ppl are just naturally good hearted and will greed 100% of the time or they are ignorant of an items value.
---
This is what I would do personally as I believe it‚Äôs good etiquette, but that‚Äôs my personal belief. If everyone in the party rolled greed and then I roll need at the last second I would feel scummy.
---
This logic makes no sense though and can be flipped such as,
---
‚ÄúIf the alchemist wasn‚Äôt lazy they would have just farmed the gold and bought the recipe. ‚Äú
---
The potential is the same on all boe and everyone should need. If the winner is feeling charitable it‚Äôs always nice to offer a sale to the group member at a discount. Party member gets a quick sale and the alchemist gets a solid discount.
---
Saying one person is lazy but the other isn‚Äôt makes no sense for something freely available for purchase.
---
Reserve the item. Plenty of people run the instance for gear with no intention of seeing the recipe. Preferably just have the gear or better from the instance already since you are reserving a valuable item. Being a tank or having a tank friend would be helpful as well.
---
I played with it just in wotlk and it was great. I never had any problems.
---
I did 465 runs before I saw mine. It's totally possible
---
It's not out of spite, it's about avoiding the queue.
---
People will absolutely gquit a guild they've been a key and happy part of for 6 months when it comes to loot drama over serious items like nelths tear/rejuv gem/DFT. MC doesn't really have items that truly are BIS for a year+ for multiple classes (outside maybe accuria). BWL has many. The worst is yet to come. 
---
It's scary, all those good times and effort - the social bonds and friendship - just evaporating over what some pixels and stat boosts they represent.
---
Pservers your wbuff set was max hit, i ran 15-17. Here you basically get a free 19% hit
---
Your conclusion would make a lot of sense if we lived in a world where Flask Recipes only dropped for Alchemists. That isn't the case though, so you'll always have someone who can't use the recipe themselves putting it on the AH for a high price.
---
This means Alchemists will still be paying a high price to buy the recipe because they don't want to spend the time farming for it, leading to higher Flask and Herb Prices to recoup the cost, etc. As long as the Auction House exists "need on expensive items" will always be the safest and, to some, the most fair approach.
---
They get every black lotus every hour just.campimv the spawn locations
---
No communication needed if you‚Äôre an alchemist and can learn the recipe. Bunch of ninjas in this thread.
---
You easily get what you need from gear (Lionheart helm, Band of Accuria, and Don Julio's ring account for 5 of the 6% needed alone, plus one of the hit bows and you are capped) and due to the now prolific use/knowledge of the heroic strike queuing bug, you don't need to go over hit cap because you gain almost nothing for doing so.
---
That's not how stats work lol have you heard of sample sizes
---
3 days, level 42, 2 bars off 43
---
Fair enough.
---
I've not played for about a week, but if it's anything like when I last played Horde are too disinterested in defending / confused how to in some games, and unless Alliance plays poorly those games are losses. A force of 10ish players recalling and playing with good coordination (for a pug) can defend Drek pretty well and mayhap recap Relief hut, add in some forces from mid and they can help out / recap FW GY. But it takes a number of competent people who understand the consequences of not defending, else it is lost. And you might know that getting people to listen in AV is not always the easiest of tasks.
---
roll need on everything, if u are one of the "all greed" people dont complain when stuff gets ninjad from you
---
Such a skilled player.
---
Gnome warri with pala armour? I like it!
---
The difference is that the warrior if he lost the roll would not be able to simply just go on the auction house and buy the weapon. So for you the weapon is worth 5g, for the warrior the weapon is worth potentially 100-200g if not more. On the other hand, a BoE recipe that's worth 100g to you is worth 95g to everyone else (since they'd have to pay the 5% AH tax), which is very different.
---
were you able to get up there again? can you get to the rooftops?
---
Lower pop, pve and RP servers tend to be less competitive in my experience.
---

---
Dont get me wrong, i always declare all roll need on boe when i did run dungeons.
---
But to be so inflexible to refuse to reroll when there is clear disruption in communication and to call others he dungeoned with idiots while waiting on 3/5 to roll greed before need just shows clear taking advantage of situation. Other pubbies were wrong in that they should have all rolled need, but the op's intention seems to be misleading/dishonest if you look at it from cynical angle. If he really was trying to resolve this priblem, he would have tried to solve it in group with a belated discussion after.
---
If it's not the most convenient way possible, it's shit. At least that's how many people seem to think.
---
I still have my original core hound authenticator from 2009 running on the same damn battery
---
And that is the proper way to go about it
---
What fair roll? Its an alchemy recipe. Alchemist should get it if he doesn‚Äôt know it. It‚Äôs unfair to force him to roll for it against people who are greedy ninjas.
---
I'm not quite sure I follow, but I want to know lol. Do you mean on the initial pull or do you normally try to frost nova every time it's up so you benefit from shatter?
---
You people are the worst.
---
The problem is that this system can work fine in MC, but when you get items in BWL that will last you for 3 more phases, or AQ items you will never replace and give an exponential boost to your character... it's a whole different world from amicably dividing MC loot thats pretty meh in most cases. It brings out the worst in people.
---
It's Orcs vs Everybody.
---
&gt;It's just insane to think that in a community oriented game farming anything in a group is strictly not allowed according to most of reddit.
---
Not a single person has said that. Try listening to what people are saying instead of ignoring it and arguing with strawmen
---
You should still let the person that rolled greed roll after the fact. It‚Äôs only fair
---
But then when BWL comes around you're sitting on 8/8 with BiS weapon and everyone else is like 3/8 with aurastone... So ofc you're happy with it, since you're benefiting most from it.
---
Pro tip if you go into the wtf account folder of the character that has the setup ui and copy and paste that folder to where the new character is and rename it the new character your ui will be all set.
---
If it‚Äôs more valuable to you as a user then by that logic the listed AH price is at a discount based off utility and you should have already bought it. 
---
But you didn‚Äôt so you would seem to think the value is either below or in line with the AH price. Which would mean it provides no additional benefit to you relative to a non alchemist.
---
Jealousy
---
Battlegrounds should not show which battleground you are entering when you queue. There is no reason for that function when AV rarely lasts longer than deserter.
---
What happened to https://vanilla-questing.me?
---
This just in; Chinese gold farmer tries to communicate with /u/Hail-Honkler in unknown mandarin dialect.
---
My guess is that they are playing around with layering again because of all the world PVP that was bogging down servers. They have HUGE outdoor events coming up like AQ and they know they need to fix the world lag issues.
---
no

The problem with this stance in classic is imho that everything you do with randoms is just so easy. You dont need a good group to do 5man content unlike some heroics in tbc that were actually demanding.
---
In tbc I added good players to my friend list so I can do heroic Shattered Halls/Alcatraz and others. In classic I can do everything 5man with randoms. Only thing I wouldnt do with randoms is 2man jump runs or 3man strat live.
---
You need to like click need on everything and get a real bad rep before it matters in classic.
---
Strat? I was just looking to force some pvp.
---
I just hit 51 and ran AV just to get the idea. As a rogue, i can stun a lone horde for a while if im with people, but if im alone im actually worthless. Ill just go to grab rep for honored stuff while leveling now.
---
Or if you really are just starting out, don‚Äôt worry about any addons. Just use your blizzard raid frames first. In the interface options make them change colors on curable debuff‚Äôs etc. Depending on how ‚Äùgood‚Äù you become, you can later on start looking into addons.
---
I never claimed to be horde. Relax dude.
---
Boes (including epics) are worth same to everyone in group. Rules should have been stated before to avoid this problem but op's unwillingness to discuss the issue after loot when people were clearly unhappy with it and he also saw the 3/5 greed before doing his response judt seems very inflexible at best. Calling the people idiots dont help either
---
If Crimson Shocker is making anyone in your raid happy, I think you have bigger problems.
---
Retail spent years over multiple expansions to revamp and eventually remove the Vanilla loot system. Can't really start loot drama when loot tables are limited each player's own spec.
---
&gt;What if I'm an alchemist who runs the same exact run every single day in an attempt to farm a recipe that drops off a boss. Are you saying that if something cannot be solo farmed it should be only obtainable via the AH? That's insane to me.
---
No, no one is saying that. What you should do is create your own group and reserve the item so everyone knows the rules beforehand. If you don't do that you're opening yourself up to the possibility of other people also rolling against you whether they're an alchemists or not.
---
doing what?!
---
Because you were most likely a young clueless teen.
---
You didn‚Äôt suggest anything, you just shit on OP.
---
The changes to AV happened 4 months after it was released, and lasted 15 months to TBC. Stop spreading misinformation.

It isn't really 10g profit per day. You have to compare it to your other transmutes, fire-&gt;earth and earth-&gt;water can be 3-5g on a daily cd too. So it would be double the time to break even taking opportunity cost into account.
---
Oh please, the horde cutting back in the same way every time is a strat to wipe the alliance so they can‚Äôt rush south and kill drek.  This isn‚Äôt something you came up with on your own just because you have a life and are just playing ‚Äòto have some fun man‚Äô.  It might be why you do it, but it‚Äôs not why the people you learned it from do.
---
Yes. I got my guildie to buy an epic mount for me so I could save 90g, gave him 10g for the time spent.
---
Not only that, the dps and heals wouldn't stick around either due to the tanks not being able to hold aggro with only mitigation gear
---
Honestly I just ask if I can roll on it when it drops and I've never had anyone tell me no. I won Reiver Claws against 3 warrior while healing on my pally and nobody complained. I feel most people don't care about losing a roll for loot in a dungeon since they can always run it again.
---
Raid loot is something else tho, scary stuff. People get very worked up over that.
---
Yes it's bind on use.
---
We are totally on the same page here! I just used a bear as an example since they were originally talking about hybrids! Me myself, as a warrior, would go in as a tank when I was gearing up as a DPS purely because of the lack of tanks compared to DPS. That's also why it's nice to put in the small loot distribution rules, even in 5man pugs. (I am a DPS and will roll for DPS gear)
---
Classic Huntard
---
I also find it very rare that it ends without horde getting 2k+ honor
---
Probably people farming the water invasion in winter spring. I don't think there are too many people doing it and you get to kill a lot of elementals that drop it.

Be careful out there!

Tell me exactly what about my above comment in innacurate.  I‚Äôm all ears, bud lol.
---
I suggested better comedy, then followed with an example. Do you have a diff version of what suggest means?
---
Avoiding the queue by never leaving the battleground?
---
Theres 1 pvp guild that I know of on horde but ivr heard theres a few serious ones on alliance. The serious pvpers went alliance
---
Yea, go through op's response in this thread. He is just selfjerking with only posts that agree that he is on right and seems to be taking scummy attitude.
---
Refusal to even discuss the loot after looting when there was clear miscommunication is a red flag
---
I wish Gnome Paladins were a thing.
---
Classic heartseeker alliance
---
It won't fix anything. 
---
Classic PvP system just does not work in 2020 as it did in 2005. 
---
The situation is exacerbated even further with Blizzard's decision to remove progressive itemization, which means that they released Naxx-level gear even prior to BWL release and now there are way more people pursueing it.
---
If you do not know what it means here is a short explanation: most PvP reward stats (Including epic ones) were dramatically boosted with 1.11 patch Shadow of the Necropolis patch to match respective PvE content.
---
Nope, dancing sliver has a bit more spirit although its close
---
He's a pink gnome mage that sells 2g portals
---
Incendius I think.
---
I‚Äôm finding healing on priest really straightforward in raids.  
---
You can use healbot and set up to click on frames to heal/dispel/etc if you want to avoid keybinds.  With control, shift, right, left  and middle, you get a lot of options at your fingertips.
---
GRIZZLY is gone and if Fusion leaves it‚Äôs over.
---
Your response in this thread and attitude with being inflexible with loot discussion on boe is a huge red flag with your guild if anything if you are anywhere near leadership position.
---
sure but we were talking about the dps, there's no reason the dps check would ever be an issue
---
Yeah, I mean more for the stuff that‚Äôs a pain to grind. Hand of Justice comes to mind.
---
Maybe if youre bad dps. Ive done all 3 roles and i feel like healing is so easy its basically a joke. You dont even need to pay half as much attention as a dps does and do just as good of a job.
---
Worth can mean more than just its monetary value. You can include what it can do for that person.
---
You can't swap pieces that aren't weapons or shields while in-combat
---
Run in and die.  Maybe bring an invisibility pot to get close to the flag spawn or to position yourself to kill off other mobs.
---
It‚Äôs an issue when they‚Äôre dead because the tanks died.
---
Premades that win prioritize PvP, i.e. killing horde if there are any. Alliance does not, because that is seen as "inefficient". It happens because of two major reasons:
---
1) Most good players are forced into premades, because its the ONLY way to rank
---
2) if you try to pvp and don't just run past mindlessly and die, gnomes will yell at you how stupid you are
---
Although I get some reasons why the don't allow it , I think it'd be so fucking fun to be able to at least queue with 4 of your buds and roam the map fucking shit up.
---
People are getting close to 200k honor a day
---
My friend had this the other day, we calculated the chances as ~0.6% and if you have 4 melee in your group rolling for both ~0.04% chance of winning both. He got the MH and was second on OH so pretty sick stats
---
Just about any pvp server will have an abundance of horde
---
Just got the ST trinket, it's great
---
Because every game there are 5-10 afk people. Why would I want to play in this garbage battleground if I can just afk and do something else.
---
I have the most fabulous water, its the most beautiful water you've ever seen. Its YUUGE mage water!
---
I've seen it happen twice already on BOE epics in dungeons. BOE epic drops. People instantly greed roll and then some rando rolls Need. Better to roll Need to protect yourself from any chance of getting Ninja'd.
---
We guild ran for one guy to get either, he was happy
---
You can have windfury from a resto
---
No shit? You can however wait till you're out of combat and switch out to another ring while the ability is on CD.
---
I just cut to the slow mounts to take 3v1s or even 5v1s and pop all cooldowns and whirlwind cleave everyone in 1 global, if they have a slow mount chances are they likely don't have a lot of gear.
---
Yeah its not better for rep, better for honor though.
---
Not anymore since queue times are 25+ mins for horde it has slowed down a lot
---
I can only read this as "Son broke my MMO Mouse and Keyboard. Any good boxing combos?"
---
Congrats my man! You other rogues are some lucky son of a guns! I'm sitting here with just both my dalrends and like every other rogue I see has both Brut Blade and viskag and i'm in the corner crying XD
---
Someone had to do more reactive stuff and raid heal, dispels, dodging. You screw up your rotation as DPS, your DPS drops - screw up as healer and someone else drops.
---
But I think we can throw examples like this at each other all night - maybe we should just agree to disagree, mate :)
---
Yeah. Normally just far ranging and minimal FR is enough to where you're not taking a hell of a lot of damage.
---
Far from every raid push full buff slots on regular warrior dpses. Hunter's in these groups will contribute more with Furious Howl than cat otherwise will bring.
---
What's the line here though? Obvisouly something worth 500+g is expensive but what about 100g? 50g? 10g? 
---
The need button was created for people that intend to use the item themselves.  Greed is literally defined by intention to sell the item.
---
My personal view - if you need it, need it.  If people want to Need on things they're going to sell then I'll just avoid those people.
---
Hahaha wow, tell him the odds and make him go to the lottery, must be his lucky day
---
Yep you will collect a stash of on use aoe trinkets from there. Keep them around and swap them out each pull. By the time your 60 you should have enough to have something up for each pull.
---
My girlfriend felt Rag should have been holding something in his hand so she made this addition.
---
Premades are a godsent. I would jump off the roof if I had to be in another pug AV. Also no one is forcing you to do AV, you can spam wsg premades and get similar honor.
---
Yeah i agree with you on it. Its stupid to have it uncapped, just forces your gpu to push itself for no reason at all, Classic is a stupid easy game to run, uncapped i get over 300+ smaller places like dungeons i get 500+ and my GPU rarely even turns its fans on when i play wow, but i noticed when i reached 600 fps in a dungeon my computer went on blast mode, temp went from 55C to 70C, as soon as i capped it back to 144fps, my temps went down immdiately to 55 again and all 3 fans went to 0% speed. Thats why sure keep it capped at 160,170 fps , but anything 200+ is just stupid, no reason to even force your gpu.
---
The amount of skills with downranked spells had put me off playing shaman. I will look into this addon.
---
therefore you ALWAYS need 6% hit. stop trying to be smart. you arent.
---
&gt; If alliance all go together they will win every time.
---
I think he kind of addressed that.
---
No omen for those of us going hotw spec.
---
I see where your hung up, but you‚Äôre adding a variable to one aspect without the other. What if hypothetically someone wins the alchemy recipe and sells it for gold, then uses that gold to buy a, let‚Äôs say tailoring recipe, and then sells the item made from the tailoring recipe to make gold. That value from the sold tailoring still stems from the alchemy recipe the same way that the alchemists potions make them money, just in a different form. 
---
So basically the recipe is worth X, and the way you use it after is worth Y regardless of what you use the recipe/gold for. X doesn‚Äôt change the value of Y in mine or it would seem others opinion.
---
The term "hacked" doesnt apply here imo. 
---
Some rando bruteforced accounts of people who dont use 2FA and have "password" for every service they use, that has been leaked 20 years ago because some shit site didnt encrypt passwords and had their db directly accessible from the internet.
---
OhMa GoD, i GoT HaCkEd!11!1
---
Are they selling flasks for a markup?
---
Even if a raid uses worldbuffs, most raids' dpses only bring the standard ones for dps. Mostly tanks go out of their way to reach the cap. And would you honestly say a raid that brings buff capped dpses are close to the norm in raiding? Is that the context we should assume the average hunter is a part of?
---
This advice is not very good. As a priest you should downrank, even in 5 man dungeons, but not until you have +healing gear. With base stats and no +healing gear, your highest ranked healing spell will be your most mana efficient. Once you have +healing gear, your lower ranked spells will become more efficient. I don't know the specifics on the priest side of healing, but you probably want to start downranking once you have around +250 healing. You can sit in town and run tests by healing yourself and checking your combat log. You want to be using the most efficient healing spell you can that heals between 800-1000 hp. This will be your bread and butter healing spell.
---
Thinking that your game will be better with 30 more alliance lol
---
Yes.  It's genuinely one of the worst systems ever designed.
---
Add it to Aimed shot macro.
---
I did a lot of AV as horde this week and there are a few things to note 
---
1: co ordinated and good alliance is unbeatable . Can‚Äôt even pick anyone off. They sit at FWGY and cap if they are afraid of being wiped at relief hut. I‚Äôm always afraid when I see alliance going to galv from the east. 
---
2: horde have to turtle to win, maybe get ice lord as a win condition /making alliance lives hell. If you can stall it out sometimes the alliance just quit trying.
---
3: can be unlucky based off of healers in alliance or horde.
---
4: alliance are queuing together. It‚Äôs super annoying because if they get in horde usually lose and it‚Äôs back to a 25 min queue. I here there is a discord where alliance hang out in get in the that AV # game. I‚Äôm sure there is a lot of ‚ÄúREEEEEEEEEE‚Äù screeching but they can just mute them and try to win .
---
If your tanks are bad rogues are arguably better since they don't have to worry about threat
---
That‚Äôs impossible, I might have got my calculation weong but it is around 1% since it‚Äôs a 7% drop chance on a 1/6 boss spawn, unless the boss spawns are heavily weighted.
---
You will never stop doing MC. We used to do it even when we were well into Naxx. My current guild has plans to do the same.
---
My trick is to just look at the dungeons that have the BIS. I try not to look up what boss it drops from, and just run the dungeon for fun. If I see the item sweet if not on well.  
---
That being said I had a priest roll on a +Stam +Str ring I rolled need on, fuck that guy :P
---
Right and if you are then you have to do it to compete. Meanwhile alliance can just chill on ironforge.
---
Naw onyxia is a total slut you gotta take a number
---
oh my god do those bar separations indicate what does and doesnt stack and/or shares a cooldown?!
---
Hows the quality on the Rag? Is it entirely cast bronze?
---
Imagine treating MC like it was AV. 
---
RUSH DOMO, NO LUCIFRON FIRST
---
So your entire argument is:
---
&gt;Other people suck so it's ok if I'm a piece of shit too.
---
Checkout what preBIS is for warriors on wowhead/icyveins, i dont really think any classes/specs use pvp rep gear as prebis gear, maybe don julio ring from AV
---
 I want to be able heal raids without having to respec a lot   Ele/resto 30/0/21
---
No its the 15 year anniversary one, hes just plastic
---
Why top end dmg specifically?
---
Play Kromcrush. It's a reaaaaal nice server.
---
In these groups that have threat issues, you should use a set for threat tanking that gives up some defensive stats for hit/crit/str. Put back on defensive gear for bosses still. 
---
Shift in and out for 10 range for a second quick maul.
---
As other mentioned in heavy dps comps that  are peeling of you, if they pull skull/main dps target off you and its at like 50% health and not running towards your healer, just let it go. Build threat on the next target
---
As others mentioned, pre hot yourself
---
Remeber you have a stun that this another way to peel. 
---
Remember if it's really getting bad use your AoE taunt. Too many times you will have wiped at it being a 10min CD kept you from using it and you'll be dead and it will go unused. Be liberal with it baring known upcoming fights you know you want it for.
---
And sometimes just realize that your not going to hold threat while you're still gearing from the fully epic mage who starts every fight by pulling for you with frostbolt.
---
Luck is memoryless
---
You‚Äôre just being ignorant at this point. A cat will bring more overall dps than a wolf with howl, and that‚Äôs without the buffcap issue. Not to mention wolves can‚Äôt howl on CD after a few howls because the focus regen is smaller than howl‚Äôs cost.
---
Paladin/Lock very good because of synchronized movement speeds. This is what I did with my bro and it was really nice.
---
Priest/lock is also very good because of the high dot potential.
---
Warrior with any healer is obv awesome.
---
Tip :  make a few /s or /party macros your can hit when you need to communicate sticky situations quickly as a healer ‚Äî groups (and more importantly) will love you for being clear and communicative.  
---
Here are the ones I use: 
---
/s care low mana
---
/s care LoS
---
/s aggro help
---
Great visual gag in any case :) I had actually completely forgotten that! 
---
Went back and watched the other gift, fun with multiple endings
---
I mean i literally played this version of AV in vanilla and people would group queue as well.
---
Possibly social engineering, i.e. contacted Blizzard support pretending to be you and dug up enough details about you via social media to pass their identity verification questions.  It‚Äôs not likely but it‚Äôs possible.
---
Yeah but I want to win
---
None of them got it listed since WSG items release at P3.
---
But it's not lmao
---
If you‚Äôre 30+ with a family, you probably have kids and kids can be bought. Might those kids run into hills and try to 1v30 horde? Maybe. But you still gettin that sweet rep and honor.
---
and rightly so, there is no reason now to haev balanced PvP servers, and if BGs weren't cross-faction there would have been an incentive.
---
you got it! make sure to click the class tab at the top.
---
It's always bad publicity and costs money, not the $15, but the work hours that come with it. Also once it's known that blizzard bans people without reason other people might abuse that.
---
Horde here: RFC till 16-17 then quest/SFK to 20. Then you can go with Cath (locked until level 20 now) then ZF ideally. After that BRD then get into your end game runs for pre bis farming. 
---
With 3 warriors you are gonna spend a lot of time in BRD for HoJ
---
Ok you won. You are smarter and clever.
---
Pshero
---
wow yea, this is the spreadsheet i was hoping existed, thanks very much
---
Are any other horde druids ranking? I'm having serious issues reaching our server's honor cap and I wonder what I'm doing wrong. I'm playing 30/0/21
---
No, a BOE recipe that's worth 95g to everyone else, is worth orders of magnitude more to the Alchemist due to them getting continuous use out of it until the day they quit WoW or Blizzard makes the Flask obsolete.  It's the same argument you just made about the warrior weapon.  "Potential worth".
---
Agreed, realistically set your expectations. Say, I am after XYZ, is anyone else going for it? Yes.. ok I have a 50% chance of winning it if it drops.
---
How is 10 energy worth it? You never really get to 100 energy during fights, let alone 110.
---
For horde, the only flight path is on the literal opposite side of the map from the hillsbrad entrance.  The village, which is the main quest hub, is at the bottom of a huge cliff.  To get down the cliff, there is a path that leads north, the opposite direction from the village.  When completing quests, to turn them in you have to run back down this path, then double back to the village. To get to the questing areas, most of them are up in the "square that's all flat".
---
What's Asmongold experience? Nothing on wowhead.
---
I could be wrong, and can‚Äôt currently view the items for exalted WSG, but I would have to think the grind for other similar stat gear would be quicker than the WSG exalted grind if i had to guess
---
Usually 30 but yeah I had a couple of 50's.
---
Similar honor? Horde turtles virtually every WSG they lose, 30 mins for 2k, i.e. 4k per hour is NOT the same as 8-10k per hour that is average from premade AV. It's half, if you're having trouble with the math.
---
Increase it even to 6k if you want, from HKs, hell even 7k (that's about max per hour from WSG), you're NOT going to get the same as an AV premade.
---
And when the top 100 people on your server, where 100th standing is about the start of bracket 10 (or even 9), are doing AV premades, you have two choices - never rank up or play AV premade.
---
Lmfao you just got done saying ‚Äúmost of the complaining in this sub is all done by alliance players!‚Äù, Now you‚Äôre shying away from faction? You said that for a reason. But I digress, I just think in your post you play a bit stupid and that your narrative may be influenced just a bit as a horde player. you know damn well why it‚Äôs mostly alliance players. Unless you‚Äôre on like the one or two realms that go against the norm, if you‚Äôre an alliance pvp player, you are most certainly outnumbered and on a different playing field. BGs have helped a lot but stop acting like your majority wasn‚Äôt making the game downright toxic for the other half of the pvp playerbase just a month ago. Why can‚Äôt you just admit you guys all stacked the deck, intentionally or not?
---
You got it. If no one else, including blizzard cares, why should I.
---
Do you seriously believe that that? Pretty out of touch.
---
after 30 mins of camping SH gy the big brain alliance go cap SF then sit there for another 30 mins until loss.
---
anybody who criticizes this flawless strat gets relentlessly mocked and reported. 
---
fun times.
---
At least you admit you're OK with being a piece of shit as long as other people are too.
---
This is how toxic communities develop and games die.
---
The warlock discord has a gold farming channel work several videos pinned. Dive and the other folks there are super helpful. BTW, it‚Äôs going to take some time to learn, but don‚Äôt get discouraged!  The payoff is worth it. It‚Äôs definitely not like Mara where you can YouTube a video and then watch Netflix while you cruise through it. 
---
https://discord.gg/wuSHA9c
---
Do you need to be a specific pvp rank to get it at this price?
---
Ok I guess that could be a suggestion, but suggesting someone changes their taste in comedy is pretty idiotic. People will like what they like.
---
Imgur fancies itself as it's own social network now. Talk about too big for your britches.
---
Not this shitty, and it wasn't the most honor efficient BG either (outside of AV weekends).
---
This AV is a fucking joke with all the NPC nerfs. If Blizzard just fixed honor scaling so people could do... actual PVP for PVP ranks the game would be better off.
---
nerf AV or buff WSG, I am fine with either decision
---
If blizzard doesn't care enough to fix a broken system, then why should I care.
---
ü¶Ä$11ü¶Ä
---
I wonder if people still pretend anymore that the overall population isn't massively in favor of horde.
---
You're wrong, FIY.
---
&gt; If I were to permanently close someone's account I want to be damn sure I am 110% confident I am doing the right thing. And I think that's what it's about 
---
Absolutly, that's what I think.   
---
&gt;Blizzard are the experts, they have people that worked on classic and they've hired some very good people to work on classic. They know how to run MMOs. 
---
I think first-hand experience running these servers over years is really valuable, not only in technical perspective, but more in a strategic sense. Rolling out content, prohibiting things like faction imbalance and world pvp in P2. No matter how smart you are theoretically you couldn't possibly predict these things without experiencing it for yourself.
---
The point which you seem to have missed is that the prevalence of premades is severely impacting pug matches.  In the past few days a fairly high percentage of the pug games I have been in have started with 20 or fewer players.  Which means for the first three minutes or so you have half as many people.
---
If you don‚Äôt think this is a big deal why do you guys require epic mounts?  Starting three minutes behind is worse than not having epic mounts.
---
The other question this prompts is why you guys are such bitches that you can‚Äôt go into a game with 20 people?  You need a full premade against a horde pug or you can‚Äôt compete?
---
the people at the top are almost all cheating
---
&gt;If blizzard doesn't care enough to fix a broken system, then why should I care.
---
‚Äî Horde players on Flamelash
---
I totally blame the \#nochangers, these naive people have caused so much damage that the pserver community learned to compensate for after running the game for like a decade.
---
Yeah but if you have an alt perform it you don't get the opportunity costs. I have it on my alt and do normal transmute on my main.
---
I‚Äôd disagree. 
---
I run premades and sometimes horde has a full defense and get like 1500 honor and barely any HKs. 
---
They‚Äôd do better killing all LT‚Äôs get 3k honor and requeue
---
Wow you're able to beat PuGs in a premade?! That is definitely something worth bragging about!
---
I don't know why but "reaaaaal" sounds suspicious for some reason lol. I can check it out tomorrow when I get home.
---
Wsg premades take about 7-8 minutes per game. And you get about 3400 honor from game + kills.
---
Endurance Training while leveling, Improved Hawk at 60.
---
With 18-28min queues the av needs to be at least 15min+ mostly about 20-30min to be efficient.    
---
Max honor from Commanders, quite a bit of honor kills in the middle ground/whiping ally at Galv/Drek and then once the killcount/player goes over 3/4 finish quickly.
---
where do you play? oceanic?
---
Yes I think we think the same :D
---
I almost left my guild over some silly drama for a cloth hat. Main is a priest, the other guy was a Druid, and we were about level 40 or so. 
---
I got over it and stuck with the guild, but I still think the other guy is a douchebag and I won‚Äôt group with him. I‚Äôm middle aged fwiw, and felt silly getting all worked up, I think my wife even noticed a little. :P
---
Except that other healer is clearly running that dungeon for the loot as well, the only difference is they are actually healing and therefore get priority. MS &gt; OS
---
This has been the bg meta on private servers since pretty much forever. I was hoping x-realm would fix this but in general the casual appeal of pvp has been declining for a while.
---
I got 400 gold how the fuck do you have 10k
---
If your goal is to have every item soft ressed then fine. But like I've said 12 times now, that isnt our goal. Our goal is for people to target the pieces they need regardless of what others are doing and gaming the system
---
How is it so hard to understand people value their time differently than others? Lmao.
---
Imagine comparing a leather armor with no stamina to sgc. What a time to be alive.
---
You should **always** find one person in your zone and team up. Whatever class it is, doesn't matter, you will synergize beautifully. You'll pull and kill more than 2x as fast as you would alone, getting more loot and XP even with a 50/50 split. And it goes without saying that two people playing together is a 300% less attractive target to gank than 1 person alone.
---
Wait, does that soul keeper trick work even in combat? If so, wouldn't it make sense to stack spirit on everything, not just my weapon
---
Yes come have fun. I never got to raid back in the day and my guild is pretty bad at it so we are still learning MC in 2020. It's pretty fun even though we suck. I look forward to the days when we have it on farm like others but for now we are all enjoying learning and growing together.
---
We started loosing honor once the Alliance started killing Balinda and slowing down matches by killing generals for Honor.    
---
At that point it became less honor in slightly longer matches so we had to adapt, easy fact.
---
Pvping on a Pvp server isn't toxic, try again.
---
All of us ally that played last week are already exalted with insta queues and 10 minute wins.
---
Remulos, Oceanic.
---
Red gift for the win. I do wonder though in his universe lore which did he pick? Or did he get both? Amazing job as usual.
---
You know premades are a lot less common then pug groups, right? Losing quickly against a premade once in a while is a lot better than losing almost every game which alliance pugs are currently doing
---
Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this.
---
Correct, but that‚Äôs not a part of the question he asked.
---
Thanks! I'll try this
---
I don't think it's just the gear. Most guilds killed things faster than that week 1. You guys most be the wrong spec, no consumables, not trying, etc.
---
To be fair you don't need to have 20 totems keybound. It helps if you have the skill for it certainly. But you can get away with a macro that just puts down the same 3 totems in order and place them before ever fight. Then for specific bosses you might use a more situation specific totem like poison or something
---
Honor gain was easily the best day1.   
---
But that was without ally killing balinda, very short queues and very unfun playstyle.
---
Really fking slow. Damn I thought we were normal. Guess not. On Garr I'm top dps but by the end I'm wanding because adds are still up. On golemagg, we all have to evoc. All 6 mages.
---
Thank you sir
---
Whatever happened to ‚ÄúNeed if need‚Äù?  I state that up-front before the run, with the clarifying statement that you only need if you can use it.  Need is not for grabbing an item to sell - if that was the case everyone would need on every drop.  I‚Äôm a LW and if a rare pattern drops that I haven‚Äôt yet learned I am rolling need - and would expect other LW‚Äôs to roll the same, while all other professions roll greed.
---
We usually win nowadays. So we do get it at the end, right?
---
  Seems like more healers play Horde in pvp but that may not be true.  
---
No, we just die because someone pulled the entire room and there's 4 war masters running around bitch slapping every single healer you have to death while people bitch in raid chat about how the game is a loss.
---
Always discuss high dollar BOE etiquette at the start of the group.  I personally like seeing people get upgrades and things they can actually use rather than seeing someone win some gold, so if you were an alchemist that can learn the pattern at that very moment, then you should get priority over others simply wanting some gold.
---
Same for if BOE Gear dropped and it was an upgrade for someone.
---
&gt;Pvping on a Pvp server isn't toxic
---
‚Äî[Horde Players on Fmalelash](https://i.redd.it/yayjrxpqq1341.jpg)
---
Thats the usual argument, but Im gonna bet that you dont make any friends in LFG chan. I bet that you make friends once the group forms and youre in the dungeon. How you get there is not a social experience 90% of the time. Its just "LFG ZF have mallet" every 2 minutes into a chat panel until you get a hit. 
---
This would work basically the same way, but you wouldnt need to spam and watch a channel. Its still limited to just the server, and it wouldnt teleport you anywhere.
---
ah makes sense

I talked a guy down from his AH listing of 600g to 450 a little over 2 months ago (?).  That long stretch where waters were selling for 20-23g each and undeaths were 50-75s was a dream.
---
Did not realize that we were that bad. But we don't have rag on farm yet and we are still progressing.

The line is whatever it takes for someone to quit in the middle of a dungeon and never talk to any of those 4 people again. 10g? You'll probably make that much or close to it by greeding and finishing out the run. 20g? Well if you don't have your BoP loot yet from that run you're probably going to stick around, and it's still a relatively smal amount to ruin your reputation over. 30g is usually where people say "eh I'll get my loot later, this is too much cash to pass up."
---
If I interpret correctly the first is ‚ÄúRush Drek‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúRush Galv‚Äù the third is ‚Äúturtle‚Äù. 4th is ‚Äúwin with boss‚Äù
---
Point being, there‚Äôs not such as slow enough for this guy.
---
Well I'm an Ally on Grobbulous Alliance, but I thoroughly appreciate your offer.
---
People like you are why I love classic so much. Hope someone takes you up in it, PUGging can be terrible. :(
---
Is soulfire a projectile or does it hit instantly? As long as it doesnt hit instantly you should be able to make a macro that is.
---
/cast soul fire
---
/cast curse of the elements
---
I‚Äôd say the only difference is if you have a carry. The quest xo and item rewards are too good to skil
---
The point is you told them you are going to roll on it. If you're healing and just rolling on dps gear without telling them before it's pretty shitty behaviour, no matter what your main specc is.
---
For AQ?  Not really.  Some trash packs require more coordination than most raid bosses in MC or BWL.
---
those bags giving me anxiety af
---
Your post got me interested will try to test some things out
---
Ir you mean totemkiller only way it works is with a mouseover macro.
---
20 min que lets you do the laundry, do the dishes, get a snack and drink, take a micro nap, free action potion irl, gold farm, take a shit, etc. If we had instant ques then going to the bathroom would put you behind.
---
Looks like pvp to me.
---
If its soulbound you need, If its boe, You greed.
---
As long as you're honest about it BEFORE you start the dungeon it's alright. In general the healer has priority on healing gear.
---
I love that even as he whispers you, he still doesn‚Äôt get it.
---
Having 10 more energy for pvp is huge.
---
Except they can just buy it for 100g off the AH, effectively making it worth exactly 100g for them since they can just pick it up whenever they feel like it.
---
&gt;Even if a raid uses worldbuffs, most raids' dpses only bring the standard ones for dps. Mostly tanks go out of their way to reach the cap. And would you honestly say a raid that brings buff capped dpses are close to the norm in raiding? Is that the context we should assume the average hunter is a part of?
---
I just wanted to point out a case where a wolf is not the optimal pet. I personally ran into this issue recently, which prompted me to switch to using a Cat, so wanted to share.
---
I disagree with your statement that healcomm " is of no use when you are the sole healer." It helps me atleast in the decision of what rank of heals to use altough it is needed less and less the more experienced I get. Also very nice for the tank if he has it installed so he doesnt pop unecessary cooldowns because he can more easily see my fat heal that im casting.
---
TLDR: Not as useful in dungeons but still good IMO
---
I think the bigges thing is having clearly set rules for rolling before starting and sticking to them as best as you can.  Ran BRD last night and got no loot bc of losing rolls, but thats just how it be sometimes.  Losing loot because someone rolled OS over my MS, that's seriously poor form unless it was explicitly agreed to beforehand.
---
Its mainly about people disagreeing on strategies untill they end up losing because they didn't work as a team
---
I feel you. I came to classic wow from project 99 (eq classic) where everyone is pretty chill and laid back and helpful and wow classic is a lot of assholes for no reason.
---
The ghost dies?
---
Agreed. I always roll need, but if I win an item I'd always allow the greeders to /roll against the roll I got..
---
multibox bad
---
Who cares, move on.
---
We are also quite unlucky with weapon drops in MC. Well except for Earthshaker which dropped every other raid, I have it in the bank as resto shaman.
---
We also had Shazzrah drop the exact same loot 3 raid in the row (rogue &amp; hunter tier gear).
---
Tier gear drops all the time so everything else can be quite rare.
---
Agreed. I feel like most of the comments here are textbook examples of either confirmation bias or anecdotal evidence with too small a sample size to make any reliable conclusion.
---
Having played both factions on multiple different realms I have found that both are almost identical in terms of friendlyness, skill level, etc.
---
The only difference I have noticed is that in retail there are more cutting edge mythic guilds in the top 100 (this isn't an opinion, this is easily available data on Warcraft Logs). And for 99% of players this doesn't matter because none of them will be going for world first mythic kills.
---
If you're honest about it before you start the dungeon and the healer has a chance to leave, it's alright.
---
Where on earth are you paying 120k a token? That's like at the start of BFA..... The cheapest you'll get now for a token anywhere is on the NA servers and that's currently 176k.
---
Thank you mage leader
---
For me at least, it isn't about the blue or purple pixels but more about respecting someone's time. Time is a valuable commodity and when someone rolls on something that is outside the norm (and not stated at the start), it feels like they don't respect my time.
---
Really? Wtf. Are these guilds hardcore?
---
People kill it pre 60 in leveling items if that gives you an idea of your performance as a group
---
As someone who farmed 180k honor last week, and finished with 225 standing on my server, I am honestly surprised to hear that there are Alliance teams starting under 40 people.  I‚Äôve solo queued over 100 games last week, and never did we fail to fill our roster before the start of the game.
---
Thanks, in the meantime I looked up a few things.
---
Highest pop servers with even factions are like around 8k players. EU rp server is around 3.5k. Are the servers still doing the sharding thing? OR everyone is on one big "dimension". I remember when it started, you could get to different shards by joining different parties.
---
Shadowpriest with talisman. Guess you are lucky!
---
I don't think i've seen a matchmaking that leads to such uninteresting games being played. Kind of a shame but atleast there is more to do and i could go the whole way without queueing for  BGS without any real trouble.
---
Is this normal for a progression guild? We are a role-playing/pve guild that's pretty casual.
---
Opening rotation to get SnD up asap, makes it so thistle tea refills the full 100 offered, thus more efficient, and for fights that require repositioning and retargetting it will refill.
---
Leveling a druid and tanking 5 mans, currently in the 40s. Any tips for keeping threat on 3+ mobs? Swipe spam doesn't seem to cut it. Currently I've been marking one mob with skull and casting demo roar to try and hold the others off healer, but any multi dotting or aoe by the dps and I lose everything.
---
Bs
---
Also Druid becomes extra hunter pet!  I too like running Cat and Druid cat pet.  The DPS is fantastic.
---
Wipes take even longer.  And ranged pulling doesn't have to take forever in between pulls.  You can ranged pull even while you're fighting mobs if the healer is good for it.
---
Blame Blizzard for choosing this version of AV
---
Also you rolled Horde deal with it.
---
100% yes
---
250k honor for 3 week now...
---
I m rank 3...
---
We smash premades all the time. I agree with most of your posts but I have only rarely ran into a premade that would actually win "oppressively" against a Horde pug. The amount of communication and raid warning utilized rivals some of the better alliance premades I would argue.   
---
Sure, the games where a 40 man russian "guild only" premade dismantle you in 8 minutes feel bad but in that case we still grab enough honor to make it worthwhile by just doing some of the lieutenants. I feel like all the actual "crazy good" premades are already grinding WSG instead.   
---
I feel like the whole situation actually hurts the Alliance more than the Horde because all the good alliance players will try and find premades (or are playing WSG instead) while the rest is left to the slaughter by overgeard horde pugs who are a bit behind on the rep grind or just wanna afk and chill.

Realistically it's a problem that will self correct. If horde get upset with the current state of AV and stop queuing then their que times will go down, if enough stop it will go down to 0 like alliance currently. Inversely it's also possible alliance que times go up because of this causing premades to no longer work for ally but to work for horde and like a seesaw will just flop and back and forward. 
---
Tldr: As time goes it will self correct for the most part

---
You haven't even addressed the major concerns about premading. You have no solution for how blizzard would tackle preventing premading. And why would you want an already broken ranking system to now not only be PVE ranking, but also solo pve ranking?
---
&gt;Are we just shit
---
But think of it this way: you actually get  to experience vanilla all over again!
---
Lol idk what are you talking about: if you face alliance premade in AV just turtle so they leave BG.

What do you have on your warlock?

*Screams in RP server*
---
Praise Elune I play on an RP server...
---
I love bots.
---
1. Is there a Priest discoed at all? Being new to the game and now doing my first raids, be good to get advice from fellow priests. 
---
2. I only just found out about tips like using  ‚Äò\who‚Äô and holding left shift and clicking a players name to see their location, character class and level. Are there any other cool tips like this that are handy?
---
I had a friend who was alliance. He said it was worse. Exclusion, collusion, rampant toxicity, and if u didnt like wpvp u were blacklisted. They constanstly talked shit on all channels and ruined the AH with mat hording. Fuck em
---
We have all of that except fire for obvious reasons.
---
Correct me if Im wrong but I believe Grid2 as many other raidframes addons use healcomm (it gets downloaded as part of the addon).
---
Sometimes you get cc/spellocked and then the tank can see that no heals are incoming.
---
Definetly not required as is my opinion on 99,9% of addons but extra data is always helpful (if not taken to the extreme) in decisionmaking.
---
It's not classic without bots
---
#nochanges
---
Do we?
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen AV won by a group of 5 competent players who very much did their own thing, rushing and tanking Van, and never once shouted orders to the other 35.
---
That isn‚Äôt to say that the other 35 didn‚Äôt contribute. But these 5 played their pivotal roles, and other players unbidden supported.
---
Help, or don‚Äôt. We‚Äôre gonna win this.
---
Don't care for it. I'm a healer so I've given aurastone, and tier pieces to other guildies (rolled for the gold against the pugs in the raid) . I still have no epic items at all. 
---
Im pretty realistic in what my experience in classic is going to be. I probably won't be raiding aq/zg/naxx or even bwl. Best to give to people who will likely raid with the guild
---
Id say don't stress if everyone's coming back and having fun just keep going
---
I think I‚Äôm going to take my usual dme priest buddy and do some 2 man runs. I really don‚Äôt want to go back there, but I think that way it would be tolerable.
---
That‚Äôs a bad example though since you actively don‚Äôt want all your resto shaman in 8/8 T1. With shaman the way you would do it is these people are prio for T1, and then these are prio for the off-tier BIS healing pieces.
---
A hunter won them both.

Every warrior boosted is another possible tank later.

Only way I can help is with logs to point out where things are going wrong. This is definately below average skill but your question is subjective, if you are having fun its fine.
---
Botting has come so far sense the start of WoW. Every expansion it gets worse and worse, Classic is no different.  Ban Waves won't even stop it, all those people will just buy new WoW Accounts and use the bot to level there botting toon, then bot w/e they want again for another 6mo-1yr until the next ban wave.
---
Eventually you get 0 honor per kill and if your already exalted it just makes no sense to continue
---
Herb and alchemy. Both maxed so wouldn't be thrilled dropping. Good for Mara but I'm getting very bored with it.
---
What is it you think they're going to do to "fix" this?  Make it so people can't hit the join button within a few seconds of another player? LMAO
---
Naah. Bad advice.
---
Immovable Object is a great shield. It isn't as good as Drillborer, but you have to raid to get that.
---
I get this so many times from guildies and i always say no. Its so boring and the xp is not even good. even with a full group the xp is not that much better than a regular 5 man. And i dont have the optimal build for SM, so longer downtime and kill speeds.
---
Faerlina is ass cancer don‚Äôt go
---
That may actually be the case, I am not sure about that part. 
---
But is HealComm required to show your own incoming healing (not that of others, that is)? If it is, then I concur that HealComm is quite useful, be it built-in or separate. Not being able to see your own incoming heal numbers is no good. One can live without it, but it is annoying not knowing.
---
I‚Äôm well aware. The fact that alliance can do premades isn‚Äôt the alliances fault, it just is what it is. Just like it wasn‚Äôt the hordes fault that they were dominating p2 before battlegrounds, it was simply the result of the faction imbalance. Most players chose horde, which means that the horde dominated open world pvp but on the flip side it means they get que‚Äôs. It‚Äôs kind of ironic that people were telling alliance to go back to retail or roll horde if they didn‚Äôt like getting smacked in wpvp but now that the faction imbalance affects them they are complaining of the injustice of faction imbalance.
---
Most quests require you to kill multiple mobs. Just quest normally.
---
do you have any important alch prints? that can be stuffed on an alt if no
---
It's not. It's bis until AQ40 for dps warriors, and also the bis threat chest for tanks until AQ40.
---
Whether you want to farm it over the 1ish% dps/threat increase is another question entirely.
---
Is there a way to use google authenticator for your blizzard account?

It seems really dumb that I need to set up another app for just one use....

All boe epics roll need, all big recipes roll need. Unless it's a guild run.
---
Exactly!! Thanks dude &lt;3
---
To piggy-back on this, you can spend the entire 1-60 leveling process specced ret. You will be fine healing any dungeons along the way, just try to save any int or +healing gear you find from quests or mobs. Healing as a holy paladin is easy as fuck for the most part.
---
/Castsequence reset=target curse of elements, soul fire
---
I was attempting to make a scenario where both players roll at least once before the game ends, but the second roll would be the only one with the possibility of failing which is a genuine concern. If you care enough, just roll once before the game to see who will roll first then. Whoever rolls lower starts the death roll and accepts the chance he might roll 1 right away. Or, have both players death roll independently (roll as many times until they get to 1), and their n rolls = their score. The higher score wins. 
---
Also stop using Python 2.
---
This is such a cop out. Anyone playing the game enough to rank does not want to take a 20 minute break between every game. Stop these filthy lies.
---
1/10000000000000000000000000
---
Im just saying, 99% of the time having someone to guide the zerg helps, at least on Ally side. Otherwise people split up, fall to horde, and a turtle commences
---
I find it to be the opposite. Healing dungeons is a fucking snore because no one really takes any damage so you just stand there most of the time. Raiding you're constantly healing or dispelling, there's always something to do.
---
If your team can't stop the pre-made on top of your defenses then it's mostly just because you all suck.
---
You are not a progression team. You are a group of guildies and friends having (hopefully) fun.   
---
Let me try and talk through this, first of all: you are not good, sorry (no flame). There is no way to sugarcoat it but  there are plenty of pugs who clear MC in sub 1 hour 45 min on my server while my own guild is currently at 52 minutes, looking to beat 45 minutes soon.    
---
Your setup is not optimal, your loot rules are not optimal and no one uses important consumables which would make some of the fights (Lucifron included) a complete joke (restorative potion, greater fire protection potion, free action potions etc.)  You are progressing within the definition of the term but probably not in the eyes of most "serious players", but you are progressing as a group and honestly thats enough to have a blast and a great community.   
---
Saying "we suck" is a pretty accurate way to put it unfortunately. There is no shame in it but like the other comment mentioned there are people doing it in leveling gear without wiping while others are aiming to get MC kill times down to \~25 minutes by now (which is obviously completely insane and i wouldnt be able to do that either).   
---
Let me put it this way... You will slowly improve but in a super casual guild like yours there will always be people who are not pulling their weight. You need to be able to bench those players and actually make up some small rules about consumables. Your raidleads need to rethink strategy on the bosses you struggle with and you need classleads who know what they are doing in order to speak to certain people who have no clue what they are doing. Your healers probably suck ass at reserving mana, your tanks might do some crazy wild stuff in the middle of the fight and wipe a few people, you will have DPS players who are not listening to calls and blow up the raids with bombs and ignore other mechanics etc. Its just the reality of a casual raiding guild.   
---
All of what you mentioned is normal for a casual guild doing MC, you are bad but that is perfectly okay. My advice would be to seriously consider rethinking strategy on the bosses you struggle with and if its a boss which is able to get "cheesed" with consumables your raidlead needs to make a call for people to use them.
---
Someone is jealous xD I got a downvote
---
The only annoying thing about healing is that if people die you will be the first to get blamed.  Doesn't matter if the tank pulled incorrectly or pulled when you have half mana.  Doesn't matter if the dps are aggroing every mob in town.  Doesn't matter if the dps doesn't know what a defensive cooldown.  If someones dies... "WHY WERENT YOU HEALING ME?!"
---
What if your spamming LF1M tank or healer.  And only get healer responses?  It would be dumb not to tank as the druid since if you don't you may not even run the dungeon.
---
In this scenario the druid has just as much right to roll on healing gear since it is his main spec despite being the tank
---
How not? There would be opportunity cost if I had to drop alchemy because then I have to account for what I could have gotten just doing earth or whatever. I had an alt over 35 anyway so no loss there. No opportunity cost for investing the 700g elsewhere because I'm trying to make the gold making process automatic because I have a life and frankly I just don't enjoy investing in the AH. Where else is there any opportunity cost?
---
Need to play as a team, heal in the back and, if your melee isn't blowing up theirs, then they aren't doing their job.
---
Imagine a thousand little shits watching you, hounding you, criticizing... all live.

As a Druid you should beat every warrior 1v1

K.
---
Got banthok on my 5th run. It's like 20% drop rate off the 20% boss worst case to "should" get it is like 25 runs.
---
Why are you more entitled just because your profession can use a 100g recipe? What if someone sells that recipe and buys another recipe of equal value for *their* profession? It's not *your* recipe that dropped, it's 100g in the form of a recipe that you can learn. It's not "100g for blacksmiths only", it's 100g.
---
The reality of the dungeon loot system is much different than whatever utopian picture you have in your head. It's a flawed system that was fixed later on with Need rolls becoming Soulbound. Don't pretend it's a perfect system that just requires everyone to cooperate, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
I have a warrior and a rogue in their 30s and I'm so conflicted on what I want to get to 60. They both seem really cool and fun at max level but I know I only have it in me to level one of them. I know this is subjective but would love to hear some perspective from the classes themselves after the game being out for a while. Cheers
---
/wave
---
the only thing we're getting besides /rude
---
From as casual point of view:
---
If everyone in the guild is below the 50% mark on Warcraftlogs, you're pretty shit.
---
Then your performance comes into play.  Do you log in the top 25% while the majority of the guild is bottom 25%?
---
There is no "best way" to improve.  Some players are just casual as fuck, and don't care.  My buddies and I talk about this, you either have "it" or you don't.  And it's not something players typically improve on.
---
Finesse details, like wasting GCDs for target changes, maximizing cooldowns based on fight length, aligning cooldowns and passive procs.
---
Basic understanding of the game.  Not questioning why Minor Run Speed is the best boot enchant.  Simply knowing the hit cap for their race.
---
\*\*Ability to spam buttons repeatedly for 30-120 seconds\*\*  If my mom played WoW, she'd probably only get 3-4 abilities off in a window of time able to handle 10+ spells/abilities.  Some old people, bad players, unmotivated players just can't spam the buttons fast enough, for long enough.
---
The above comment is what some would refer to as a joke.
---
Both, when I was low level doing the ZF GY (level 44) I didn't frost nova as much because I got more resists. But higher level I have been doing frost nova every time it's up. If you have your CD timers showing, you can start casting flamestrike when the spell says 17 seconds left, and then CoC after to get huge damage. The only down side is that flamestrike takes a lot of mana, so I actually specced part way through fire to get master of elements to refund some mana. This seems to be the fastest way to kill mobs, and at level 60 with green of the eagle gear  I can take down packs of elites in about a minute and a half with no mana issues. Rotation usually is nova &gt; FS &gt; CoC&gt; kite and coC again&gt;Nova then repeat.
---
Alt F4
---
By the time you get exalted you should be rank 3. If someone you aren‚Äôt it will be 720g.
---
Yeah, you can't swap armor, but you can swap weapons mid-fight. Think of the times warriors have put on a shield in the middle of combat to tank something.
---
No nothing too expensive, mostly just raid consumes and stuff like that. I do see what you're saying although and I like that idea.
---
For mana issues, focus on healing in bursts if you can and down ranking spells is good too. I usually do a big-time heal followed up almost immediately with a renew and that usually keeps the tank going for awhile (depending on fights). Then throw a renew or down rank heal on any dps taking damage, check tank health, then go about wanding until I can do it again. It usually gives you more than eno6for most fights.
---
does this show when someone is being resurrected?
---
Is OP arcane power/frost? (31/19 or w/e). Get larger mana pool and more in combat regen with arcane talents.
---
It depends heavily on how well you do it. Mage and warrior leveling is one of the worst antisynergies in the entire game. Mage is either very good at killing single mobs very very quickly with massive downtime, or they are very good at killing huge numbers of mobs reasonably slowly, with massive downtime.
---
Warrior cannot survive killing huge numbers of mobs and has terrible mass aoe, most of their abilities practically topping out at 4 targets. (you can theoretically keep rend up on more, but you won't). 
---
They also have a lot of damage over time effects the mage will CONSTANTLY clip, drastically reducing your effective dps. 
---
How to level with a mage depends quite heavily on what level, and frankly, you are just going to slow a good mage down to my undertstanding as they could just AOE grind better than you. 
---
But as a couple rules of thumb, the mage should pull, period. Warriors think they should pull, this makes no sense. a mage takes zero damage for the first 5 seconds of any fight. you take a nonzero amount of damage. the end. 
---
The mage pulls. You ideally want to charge on a caster, to get the benefit of a caster interrupting you, or on a ranged mob. Someone who could apply damage on the mage. You rend a lot of stuff, and hit stuff in the back to avoid parry chance. You focus on low armor mobs, while the mage kills high armor mobs. 
---
Once you get sweeping strikes, it's really all about how can you pull as little as possible while still not wasting any sweeping strikes damage, which is the true antisynergy of the mage and warrior: you pop sweeping strikes, and then the mage kills one of the 2 mobs you are fighting and you lose like 12 seconds worth of autoattack damage. 
---
Obviously, pulling while the mage is drinking helps (jump on the mage's pulls to build rage, then do your own sweeping strikes pulls while the mage drinks), but really, discord would help a lot. 
---
Really though, this is mostly academic. When you group with mages it's mostly for elite quests, where they are not useless but rarely enough to make a worthwhile elite quest duoable. Sure, you can poly an elite and kill a couple elites, but you aren't going to duo tharil'zun. It's just not a thing, and you can EASILY solo hogger as a mage. 
---
For regular grinding, most competent mages will want nothing to do with you, and most incompetent mages just make playing frustrating as they clip all your dots and force you to waste your sweeping strikes dps. You COULD make it work, but there is the massive negative selection bias: if a mage was willing to learn new things and adapt to tricky situations, they would PROBABLY be AOE grinding, and a guy just spamming frostbolt on mobs you pulled is a way to make sure that deep wounds, rend, sweeping strikes,  and sunder armor are all terrible, as is whirlwind. 
---
On the other hand, warriors level extremely well with rogues, paladins, druids, other warriors, priests. Really, anyone who is sort of on the warrior gameplan. The type of abilities you use leveling with a rogue are much different from leveling with a priest, but both of them work excellently.
---
just imagine that you want a \[Cauterizing Band \] from MC: you care to buy food, alchemy pots, get world buffs, you have almost perfect attendance, full pre-bis, and you are constantly competing for top-1 HPS with a few other guildies. When the healing ring drops, it doesn't go to you or your closest competitors, but to a semi-green dude "because he needs it more". Or it goes to an officer that is way below you in performance.
---
Dwarves are the shit and so are our majestic rams :p
---
I've always done this. Especially when the add one are less QoL and more drastically change gameplay somehow e.g. honorspy, spy, etc.
---
On rattlegore the population is horde 4 alliance 1 (4:1)    So if yo want some easy end game I‚Äôd recommend our server.
---
If you want it, or need it, roll for it. You‚Äôre entitled to the loot as much as the other person even if it their 100th run trying to get it.
---
Never been common, dont kid yourself.
---
You're so wrong. I leveled from 39-40 in 50 minutes yesterday being boosted by a mage.
---
Ok, first thing you need to do is look at how long the fight is, this is important for managing your cd's. Mana gems are the best starter, you always use the smallest one first. If you look at your gems, they all have a minimum and maximum mana restore value. Look at the maximum restore value of the smallest gem you're going to use. When you have that much mana missing, you pop it immediately after your next frostbolt cast, as it is not on the gcd. You decide what your "smallest" mana gem will be by 2 minute intervals. If you think the fight will be over 2 minutes, you pop the 2nd biggest one first, since the upper bound is smaller than the bigger mana gem, you can start the cooldown quicker, making you able to cast your second mana gem quicker. If the fight was a little over 4 minutes, you would start  with your 3rd biggest mana gem. This concept also applies to potions, but should be done secondary to mana gems, because you'd prefer to use mana gems over potions as they are free. You can use this trick to pop cheaper mana potions early in fights, and only save your majors for longer fights. If both of your gems and potions are on cd, then you pop your archmage robes when you are missing more than 625 mana. The reason you do this third is the fight would have to be 5 minutes plus time to consume 625 mana in order to utilize robes twice, so it should be delayed in order to get your mana gem and potion cd's up more quickly. You should only be weaving a single mana gem or potion in between your frostbolt casts, because they don't trigger the gcd. Consider using nightfin soup to supplement your mana recovery as well. If you need clarification, let me know. Hope this helps.

Sure, but which shamans don't want 8/8? The 4 in my raid want it. So regardless of what's optimum people will be unhappy. You know and hunters or warriors that are jumping at the chance to be nightfall bitch? 
---
The point still stands, even if the example was a more complex one.
---
You can use a macro like this, just replace sap with another skill. This is how rogues sap other rogues in stealth.

13 healers with only 6 melee dps is honestly crazy. What the hell are they actually having to heal at that point, the mages who can't handle not being right in the mob's face? You say you have 40 players each week, but your healers+dps is adding up in a way that makes it seem like you're running around with 6+ tanks, or people who just don't contribute, or some other crazy shit.
---
We can't really tell you exactly how to improve without posting logs other than you guys should be using consumables and look at the overall makeup of your raid.
---
Yeah I agree with that first comment. Pug alliance vs pug horde. I‚Äôm gonna say horde win 75% of the time. However alliance premades get formed and usually slaughter horde pug groups
---
My mistake, I guess theyre BoP later on. Playing every expansion ruined my vanilla brain.
---
You're preaching to the choir: Hardly anybody wants bots in their game. There's nothing we can do about it; unless the problem gets so big that there's significant sub loss because of it, Blizzard won't fix it.
---
If there's a BoE item that is worth a lot of money, *everyone* should roll need, both to avoid someone ninjaing it, and because it's gold value is the same for everyone in the party. Someone with the profession doesn't need the recipe more than the other 4 in the party need 800g.
---
Vael is not a gear check. It was known as one in vanilla because most people were playing so sub-optimally that you needed full Mc gear to perform adequately but that‚Äôs not true anymore. Vael is a tank coordination and healing check. The dps element will actually be an ADVANTAGE now, not a burden
---
so its about twice as fast at best if the mage has the spec for SM. At the expense of the mage wasting a lot of time.
---
Mana on resists is not a part of any build I am aware of, either clearcasting blizzard or fire/ice ignite.
---
Also SM is not good gold so there are no guides because people do not do it, at all.
---
Either pick up herb and farm DME or farm ZF zombies. Plenty of guides/builds/references out there.
---
you can clear raids without having every item on the super mega bis list
---
Honestly, this looks like something staged by some bored guildies to troll reddit. That one toon logs out and the other comes out of the tram.
---
i know it won't be fixed.
---
can't tell if this is sarcasm...
---
It's hard for me to believe this when rotations for most classes are 1 or 2 buttons. I'm always topping the logs or being beaten only by 1 rogue and 1 war. Thank you for the blunt assessment
---
I'm gonna build a portal, and make the Tauren pay for it
---
Hunters can dual wield spell damage 1hs and get absurd amounts of spell power, and arcane shot scales at 60ish percent while serpent sting scales at 100%. It's a perfectly viable PvE setup since a regular build pretty much stops scaling after getting Ashjre'thul
---
Why are more than one of the mages even specced into Ice Barrier?
---
Because your character is oriented in the middle and that‚Äôs where stuff you‚Äôre attacking isn‚Äôt going to be... don‚Äôt you want non-critical stuff on the edges where you can look at it but not be forced to see it all the time?
---
You should let the group know your intentions and that they agree on it. If you dont then everyone has a chance on the pattern.
---
Not necessarily. I never had the xbow drop in strat and according to math I would have had a ~98,8% change of it dropping by the time I stopped running strat.
---
rng is rng, is RNG.
---
Whenever this used to happen to me I would have to run out of range of the spirit healer and then back.
---
the sole purpose of classic is to generate money, banning bots loses money, dont ban bots.  classic is 6 phases
---
So I did. And?
---
Literally next to each other. Fucking FUMMY
---
By my calculations, it was 62:38 in EU, level 60s only. Many people argued with me that it was 51:49.
---
I appreciate you taking the time and telling me the truth. Yes, we do have a lot of fun so we all keep coming back. But we seriously want to go all the way to naxx. We want to beat bwl. What will it take for us to have a chance in bwl?
---
Havent seen this either.  Any one know the chances of having enough of these drop that a spriest gets it after all the mages+locks?
---
Its by definition and ToS explicitly not a ninja. A ninja is only possible when rolling on something you can't use, like a priest needing SGC, or breaking pre established rules on loot
---
I definitely will as soon as I get home. &lt;3
---
Insane clicking
---
Trying to compare classic and vanilla is ridiculous. This content is twice as easy and there is 10x readily available help/tips online.
---
If you and the other 39 raiders have the slightest shred of intelligence, the amount of information and references out there is abundant.
---
If you can‚Äôt down ragnaros right now, you‚Äôre simply bad or dumb.
---
You missed the point of what he said. He is saying that banning in waves doesn't work because of how the botters get full benefit for an extended amount of time to make it financially worth while to operate even should ban waves be set into place.
---
If anything introducing bot waves would actually increase botting as the botters will need to spend even more to maximize profits between ban waves.
---
If you want fun keep going as your going.
---
If you want to farm MC less healers, more dps make sure you're guys bring the correct pots, we're running with 33/34 players and sub 2 hours, would love another 7 dps üòÇ
---
But it's a game and it's what you make of it :)
---
Try borrow / find another raid leader from a friendly guild ? Worth they're weight in gold
---
Yeah I just did it with a hunter and ran through with him killing the eyes.
---
Got the Bracers of Prosperity I needed and as a bonus the healing off hand on the first run.
---
Much faster paying a little fee to do that than get a group together and do it. Especially with everyone still doing BGs.
---
You don‚Äôt time it to the end of the swing, you time it to the beginning. Basically you start the slam and immediately start the swing at the same time
---
You have a lot of healers, ideally you only want 10 healers max, but once you have gear you can go back down to 8. Sounds a lot like people aren‚Äôt pulling their weight dps wise
---
Is it better rep grind as a pre-made? Ive been thinking about joining one but the turtles are pretty good for rep if a couple people are committed to handing in
---
Not at the same time probably, but over the course of classic
---
I mean, clearly they aren't, considering like half of the images posted to reddit are hosted on Imgur. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Thanks man it was intense
---
To many Druid healers. Need to replace some druids with shamans.
---
My guild kills shazzrah in 24 seconds with 32 people in the raid. You just have to have all your melee using 2x arcane protection pots and just burning shazz.
---
Do you plan to adapt this addon to some other languages ?
---
So let's actually look at what the HKs net you. Remember, diminishing returns means you at most get 2.5 times the base value per player, and that's assuming you've farmed that player to exhaustion (4 kills worth).
---
Solo kills can be very lucrative, but those are pretty rare in AV. If you're in a five man group, a kill will be worth roughly 40-50 base. In a larger group, I regularly see 10-12 base. For the sake of argument, we'll call it 20. Now, you've got 20 times 2.5, or 20+15+10+5 for killing Player X four times. That's 50 honor.
---
Now we'll assume you somehow manage to score 4 kills on the entire enemy team. That's 50 honor times 40 people, or 2000 honor. Not too shabby, right? Except that's more of an ideal situation. If you're wiping the enemy offense four times, you're probably in a big enough group that we're back to the 10-12 value, meaning you only earned about 1000-1200. And THAT is assuming you fought and farmed the entire enemy team (many of whom are probably off AFK or fishing somewhere after the first big wipe).
---
Want to know the real kicker, though? **Those Horde on offense are getting screwed over big time by their defense buddies.** Why? Because all the points that offense earns are earned by everyone in the entire BG. So Offense earns those points, while Defenders earn those plus any kills they get. Sure, Offense does get to pick off the occasional alliance defender, but there really aren't that many of those.
---
And why does that matter? Because at the end of the day, the real competition isn't the other side, it's people on your own side who are trying to earn more honor than you.
---
I'll speak to the raid leader. Yes, I've seen some people come with the same green gear for the past 7 weeks. They aren't getting their pre bis.
---
Ashjre'thul is quite literally the best hunter weapon until you've beaten Classic, as its only upgrade drops from Kel'thuzad. Theres no reason it should ever be going anyone over a hunter.
---
7 weeks and no rag is pretty depressing. Not trying to be insulting.
---
I would seriously look at your raider's logs and evaluate performance. Help the people who are struggling if they don't understand how to play, or if you think it's a laziness/focus issue tell people they need to start performing better or they will be replaced.
---
Maybe it changed cause most first day people are 60 now but lol
---
The elements are 100% downtime cause of those couple quests
---
Alliance and Horde both just patrol the area waiting for first tag. Fun PvP skirmishes too 
---
You fight off the other faction only to then right each other for tags
---
Turns out you think you do but you dont.
---
This is classic, this is the great game. No changes. You want it you got it. Blame the playerbase for abusing the meta not blizzard.
---
Nice math and sounds about right. Remember wsg being the slowest rep of all the bg's back in vanilla. Took quite a while even with a 95% win premade.
---
Is pre bis that important? Some people on our team are really bad at getting their pre bis. Man we suck. Pugs do this faster?!
---
You still have to be a fairly amazing rogue to beat a good hunter. None of those vanishes, blind, or evasion helps at all when you get free trapped and eat an aimed shot for 80% of your hp.
---
You'd figure with how successful classic has been, they'd invest in addressing the bot problem because it's only going to lose them money. Honestly the lack of support for classic is really surprising and kinda confusing.
---
To each their own I guess.
---
I just know when Myrmidons dropped, I asked everyone to roll need, even though it's bis for me as a tank.
---
I love ‚Äúyou choose‚Äù videos. Reminds me of that old Gigi and Frostbite haunted mansion one.
---
Your work is always a treat to behold!
---
Don't look for a girl friend until you quit wow. Us guys that have a wife wish we could play more.
---
Wow you guys started really late but already have 8/10?! Impressive. It took us 5 weeks to get to 8/10
---
Netherwind is always poppin
---
Nerds are lonely. End of story.
---
Thanks! We've gotten one deathbringer and no viskags in our guild runs
---
The problem with that is it empowers ninjas when everyone greed rolls. The solution to preventing ninjas is everyone rolls need on boes unless discussed prior to the dungeon.
---
Yeah I can't wait for our first kill. It will be hype
---
Sup.     
---
It's me.    
---
It's cha boi Asmonbald.
---
No... It isn't for a lack of trying though. Alliance have instant invites so they can just sit at the npc with 40 guys and re-queue until all of them get the invite for the same game. That isn't possible for horde as you have to wait 15-20 minutes to get your invite.
---
Um.. they could roll need too...... not sure i understand why these guys got upset.
---
Loot is litterly the only reason i play for. To get stronger and outgear others in pvp. Nothing feels better than 2 shotting a mage.
---

It's like this 99% of the time, but I did have one game as alliance where we started with 22 players, obviously wiped on the way to Galv. All hope seemed lost, but then I gathered with a group at the field of strife, maybe 6 of us total. We took ice blood tower and held it. Slowly the horde went up top to kill Van, allowing more alliance to come south. We slowly went farther, capping towers and killing Lieutenants on the way. All the while about 10 alliance actually playing defense on top.
---
Eventually when we took RH, the horde panicked and a bunch of them hearthed south to defend their base from the 30 alliance already pulling at Drek. This caused their offense to weaken to the point that they struggled to kill Van or the WMs. We ended up killing Drek at the 35 minute mark, over 4k honor.
---
It was glorious, but alas, a once in a lifetime win for alliance.
---
https://wickstjo.github.io/vanilla-questing/
---
His math is all wrong but av does out perform wsg.  It's something more like 10k wsg vs 12k av
---
Really? I've been running into this 1 warlock now, for 13 levels, and he never catches up to me... pretty sure he's a bot. I've reported him everytime I see but, but I still see him out and about in Azeroth.
---
People weren‚Äôt dumb, there was just less guides on the internet tbh. But I guess your point still stands
---
Ok. the resist thing is for doing lower dungeon solo. The caster basically give you infinite mana because you resist everything. I was really only farming SM for silk/mageweave to level tailoring. But it probably makes more sense to farm ZF for gold and buy the cloth that way. 
---
Thanks.
---
Your whole perspective on this issue is so... wrong. I don‚Äôt even know where to start lol
---
That's not because of bots, that's because of design decisions Blizzard made.
---
Should I remind you about that a whole raiding guild changed for Alliance for that? It was 415ilvl loot which was better than the Mythic Uldir gear. (yeah, retail gearing is shit)
---
Theres a good hand of alt afkers farming reps in Alliance, maybe that's why.
---
&gt;Alliance premades haven‚Äôt been ending in 7 minutes since week 1.  Even my great premades games take 10 mins. 
---
That's because we stop to kill every lieutenant and commander.
---
Aq will be out quicker than 8 months from now, kinda offtopic though!
---
You say that, but we are talking about people here and people will always make bias decisions.
---
If we were talking about a machine that can calculate, how much effort each person put into the raid or the guild in general when distributing loot, then you might have a point with a unbias leadership.
---
But what is more likely to happen is that Pete and Steve know each other outside the game for years, and base their LC vote around that more then the effort put into the guild.
---
So when people say or joke about 'Corrupt LC' they are not joking it's just to which extent.
---
That doesn't help much.  If you have 80 people that all hit the button at roughly the same time, you'll get a pretty good chunk as a premade.
---
I'm not sure what you are getting at here or trying to imply. Bots being in the game didn't make retail what it is now...
---
Seen drac twice. Valor chest once. And flask of titans once. 10+ briarwood reeds. And still that mf*cking mainhand illudes me
---
Link your parses and maybe I'll listen to your terrible opinion
---
I got hacked back in the day while I had a majority of my gold/items tied up in the AH. My account was restored pretty quickly, and it was restored to a point where I didn't yet have any of those items up on the AH, they were still in my inventory. Then I noticed the listings I had up were still there, too. Almost doubled my net worth (wasn't very much at all relative to other people, but a lot to me of course). The hacker also leveled my alt's mining. Good times.
---
&gt;But we seriously want to go all the way to naxx. We want to beat bwl. What will it take for us to have a chance in bwl?
---
You might need to fire your raid leader/class leads. Failing to beat Rag, a 3 mechanics fight, is going to make going into even BWL and especially getting past Chromaggus extremely difficult.
---
There's a well known bot on my server in BS, everyone sees him mindlessly farming the elite dragonkin there. He's been reported hundreds of times and still is out there all day, every day.
---
Your triple negative doesn't make sense.
---
60 bars left for mine, easy yall
---
Don't agree at all and you can't change my mind. It's selfish to take something someone actually needs and you can justify it however you want.
---
I went with Tauren, thank you all for taking the time to answer. üòä
---
" If the alchemist wins, they gain a pattern they can use to grow their character and everyone else loses nothing at all. They never had the gold before the pattern and they still don't. Potential profit is gone, but there was no expectation of that profit in the first place before the pattern dropped. If the alchemist loses, they lose the pattern and then lose the gold to buy the pattern later, if they even have it to begin with. "  
---
This is just a big ugly  ball of broken logic.   
---
1. As a warrior, I need 0 items from Strat Live. I will still tank it for others who need it because there are a few high value item drops in the dungeon, flask being one of them. Its a good way to make money and help others, who will have a hard time finding a tank otherwise.  
---
So the expectation of value prior to the drop is absolutely there mate.   
---
2. This whole "alchemist loses the pattern AND the gold" is just nonsense. Everyone stands to lose or gain the same potential value.   
---
" It's absolutely selfish for anyone to say they need it for the gold when gold is not a need, it's a want. "
---
A recipe that you can buy on the auction house isnt a fucking NEED. No alchemist needs a flask recipe more than any other person needs gold. Its literally just a tool to make gold. I will take that 200 gold and buy prebis gear that I will  use until naxx with it. How can you fucking say you need a flask recipe more than I need my prebis items?
---
Settled on Tauren, thank you all for taking the time to answer! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Pre-BiS will make your life easier. The easiest way to kill Rag is just to do enough damage to kill him pre-submerge, which isn‚Äôt going to happen when you‚Äôre bringing way too many healers and your dps are in mediocre green gear.
---
Honestly just sounds like your guild is very, very casual. That‚Äôs fine, but if you want to improve people just need to be willing to put in the time to learn mechanics and prepare their gear/consumables ahead of time. I saw in another comment that you were hoping to progress through Naxx, and frankly there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs going to happen if your group isn‚Äôt able to put in the time they need to down Rag by now. Again, this is fine and I‚Äôm not trying to shame casuals like they shouldn‚Äôt be bothering, but realistically your group as it is right now is just way too casual for that to be realistic. Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt try and still have fun doing it, just that it‚Äôs gonna be real, real rough. If you want to make it realistic you need to get people on the same page, and spending much more time preparing for raid night, instead of just showing up.
---
You guys need to rethink your raid comp and strategies.
---
And, you need to look at logs of your guild and see how your players are parsing against others of a certain item level.  
---
You can figure out a LOT from logs.  Things like what rotations people are using, how active they are, etc.
---
The next thing to do then is start logging, and then figure out your top performers and coach your bad players - or, cut them.
---
After p2 the horde salt is actually just delicious. There must be balande!
---
If allies are doing this why do they always lose?
---
The devs don't have the time to waste...
---
HoJ is BiS for threat, the other warrior is just salty. Everyone needs it.
---
I think he's full of shit. PUGs aren't clearing MC in pre-pre-bis. Most successful PUGs are ran by a guild with a core of well-geared tanks and other players.
---
What world pvp?  That shit died the second BGs came out.
---
When the 2 popular vanilla PS I played on became stuffed with bots I wondered "who is spending enough $ to find these operations?"
---
Crit capping only applies to white hits. With world buffs your raid will kill quick and ur crit will be so high u will hstrike most hits, making crit cap irrelevant since all ur attacks inside hstrike will be yellow hits not white. Crit cap is a meme
---
Topping logs, or topping your internal damage meters?  Being #1 in your guild still means you could be total shit in the grand scheme.
---
Warcraft logs will tell you how you compare against everyone else of your class and item level.  Orange = top tier, purple = top 10%, and anything less than purple (blue/green) is trash
---
well therein lies the problem, classic wow is a living breathing game that requires upkeep and monitoring of server populations, botting, account sharing, win trading, and to an extent resources.
---
Then they aren't committed to progress and that will very quickly wear down the ones that do, who will leave and the guild will be left with the guys expecting to be carried, leading to even worse performance over time.
---
If you're serious about wanting to be effective with your playtime and your guild isn't full of your best IRL mates I'd recommend to just leave or raid in pugs.
---
Sorry I'm new to WoW classic (just started last month) how do you know someone is a bot?
---
Is this some sort of popular class joke I'm too druid to understand?
---
So hunter√ódruid
---
Again... u will be hstriking every hit when worldbuffed or ur doing it wrong. And u will only be critcapped if u have worldbuffs
---
Been getting arouns 5.5k honor for 35 min game .aounds good to me (and ofc thats not counting hks)
---
Then the botters start rolling paladins and you will never be able to distinguish a player from the machine playing.
---
Checkmate.
---
There is not super mega bis list, theres only pre raid bis and bis lists. And you most certainly want to do it now, before the loot table is changed and you have to do a whole brd run to get it.
---
1.17% chance to see one chain.
---
3.50% to see one chain in 3 runs.
---
0.12% to see 2 in 3 runs.
---
Yes sir. The thing is we don't really wipe anymore. So I feel like we have the bosses down well. Last raid we didn't wipe at all and we got all the way to rag. We just got slaughtered there. It also takes us 4-5 hours to reach rag
---
Just check in with the warrior discord "fight club" to learn about warrior dps
---
Facts.  FR gear on anyone besides tanks is not helpful.  You lose way too many stats for it to be worthwhile.
---
....wait. are bots designing retail wow?  This makes so much sense!
---
I would check your logs and see what kind of dps people are doing. You would be surprised at how lazy people can be thinking other people will just carry them. If anyone is doing like 150 dps on Rag they are absolutely killing your chances at progression by just being lazy. I suspect you‚Äôll find a bunch of people putting these sorts of numbers up. 
---
Consumes aren‚Äôt really important but every caster should have arcane elixirs, shadow damage elixirs, etc. They only cost a couple of gold. Just use them for Rag if everyone is poor. Melees should all have mongooses. Those should be basic expectations.

You can't even group as group of 5 in 1.12, but you should be able in the 1.12 AV, to at least let the Horde play with their friends.
---
I'm fairly certain the GMs do watch them when reported.  I found and reported a hunter bot in Winterspring the other day and a GM messaged me while I was killing its pet over and over to disrupt it.  Their comment about some of the bots actions made it clear they saw what I did (e.g., it stopped sitting to drink because it ran out).
---
You cannot support a full rotation on nothing but offhand hits.
---
Source: i raid in worldbuffs and did often in vanilla, up through naxx.
---
Best you can hit is something like 75% of your swings before you start missing cds and fucking your rotation.
---
I love ffxiv and ffxiv is a lot more complex in terms of rotations so I don't know what's going on with my team. Hmm war craft logs seem crucial. I'll work on that asap.
---
You can get on that invisible spot as alliance by mounting and jumping in that direction from the top of the mage tower ramp. Ive been doing it since beta.
---
I stopped though because on Pagle at least once a day I would get 5-6 tells from people who saw me "flying" from the mage tower saying "Reported". And I don't need some dumbass GM with a quick trigger finger fucking up my raid attendance, lol.
---
Christmas miracle for you, Christmas disappointment for 7 others.
---
not-so-substantiated conspiracy theory: blizzard is letting this happen on purpose just so they can say, "heh, told ya you didn't want it ;)".  
---
and even deeper down the not-so-substantiated rabbit hole: blizzard is the one who created the bots!
---
&gt; It's incredibly frustrating to see the lowest performing mages get gear because they have good rng. 
---
Is "good rng" a Mage talent?
---
We will beat him, we are so close I feel.
---
Ppl buying av rep stuffs in alterec mountains.
---
So maybe it's not a bot and it's just a person that grinds that one spot a whole fucking lot. What proof is there exactly that it's a scripted bot?
---
Yup. Not farming dungeons like the rest of us
---
Good luck man
---
Make a hunter and grab some gathering profs or skin and craft for the extra cash but outside of mage in terms of downtime it's not gonna get much better than BM hunter when it comes to just clearing content and zones for mobs people are livestreaming alt hunter solo DM runs right now on twitch as they're farming alts  that should tell you all you need to know god bless
---
On horde u can. windfury +mrp+hoj is enough rage for a full minute long boss fight with hstrike every mh hit
---
Whenever I have a good experience with another player I friend em, so I only really play with people I know now. That said, I've had a good time playing with enh in dungeons, it's just about timing SS and not using Rockbiter/ES. It's a little rng dependent with windfury but the damage is there. (For dungeons)
---
Yeah it's really apparent. Some people are getting carried hard.
---
If your wiping on normal packs of mobs in dungeons your doing something wrong.
---
If you thing you can have 100% hs uptime and still do a full rotation on anything other than the first third of Vael, then you're the one in need of some learning.
---
I don't think you've read a single one of my replies to comments. Also, you've mischaracterized my actions.
---
Didn‚Äôt blur out Vanish gg to your account
---
Player 1 buys the recipe for 200g. Player 2 gets the drop in a dungeon at the same time. Both start making gold from the recipe. The dropped recipe only saved Player 2 200g. Exactly the same amount any nonalchemist wouldve gotten.
---
I feel like if you just tanked Stratholme and reserved the first orb you'd make enough to money to buy everything you wanted in the hours it would take you to level an entirely new character in classic.
---
This is the company that apologized and vowed to ‚Äúuphold the honor and integrity of the great nation of China.‚Äù There isn‚Äôt anything they wouldn‚Äôt do for a dollar.

I mean, I'm a mage lead on a loot council. I understand exactly the problems loot council can create. My guild just puts a lot of effort into it.
---
For that rogue is it was not a Christmas miracle...
---
I suppose, in a premade you don't really notice a 10 man defense and only pay attention to 30 man ones.
---
tab through hitting each target with a maul. if you have more rage than you need to do that, then also swipe. but maul has way better threat than swipe does. 
---
you probably can‚Äôt hold everything all the time, and that‚Äôs fine. you can taunt it back onto you if you lose one. or, if it‚Äôs low on health and the dps are working on it, you could just let it go and work on the next one. they‚Äôll get it before it does too much damage. 
---
marking a kill order helps a lot.
---
To add to that, they are a horde guild so they dont want to use sharpening stones or poisons on 2h or mh weapons due to WF.  2 shamans can cover their 6 melee.
---
For the first time this past week I‚Äôve been asked by quite a few lowbies if I could ‚Äúspare a few copper for repairs‚Äù, all using the same broken English script... Some were pretty aggressive and asked multiple times over hours, giving themselves away. I feel bad for the people who are genuinely trying to help out others and are being duped.
---
Internal. On recount/details. Yeah I probably suck compared to others in top guilds but that's cuz Ive only have my robe of archmage and bindings as epics so far.
---
You can look on WoW Logs, but every guild is at 10/10 anyway.

When I'm appointed Emperor of the Teelo Dynasty of Earth, I shall create a Department of Video Game Cheating Enforcement that shall have the authority to [go into peoples houses at night and wreck up the place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDTiZoWWvG8)
---
&gt; forced to spawn at SH GY with the horde zerg between you and your team
---
Yep. Only way to deal with this dilemma is to ghost walk south and hope your team gets FW / RH. But if they manage to do that they'll most likely manage everything down there without you as well.
---
They may be true, but I find tanking for PUGs to be a pretty unenjoyable way to spend my time. I'd prefer to have a way to make decent gold that doesn't rely on other people.
---
Occasionally, and in spurts - you cannot rely on procs.
---
Not to mention that would then cripple your ability to fish for procs with hamstring (which adds much more dps than hs).
---
Mage
---
Done 178 runs now, seen Gorosh 13 times. Someday I'll get that chest!
---
You should've seen the drama on P1999 Blue Server regarding pixels...oh boy did &lt;Aftermath&gt; cause some drama...
---
ayo
---
Hardly wasting time... the integrity of the game is what keeps people playing. Without it they lose a lot of sub revenue. If Blizzard has half a brain they would realize this and implement counter-measures and some form of automatic bot detection (automated movements in a rather simple pattern etc.). At least that would make it harder for botters to keep botting.
---
TIL: I need to kill Ony more.
---
I love it.
---
I haven't quite cracked the code for PVP yet. But PVE is great
---
I haven't really tried to solo much as mage, but, theoretically, I don't really understand why resists don't kill the mage every pull.
---
With that many mobs, surely some will resist. And then you get punched in the face with your toilet paper armor.
---
If there arent thousands of bots pick pocketing in brd there soon will be. Its an 8 min loop with a vendor in the instance. Once setup it could run uninterrupted forever.
---
Work with bad info all u want, i never said hit wasnt useful at all, but the better ur clearspeed and guild, the less useful hit becomes. If ur going in unbuffed with 0 rage on bosses then sure, stack hit all day but with decent coordination u really dont have more than 10-20% or ur mh hits without hstrike on quick kills.
---
Think of what you said and how you said, then try to be less of a patronizing cunt.
---
You should have rolled a melee class then. There is a great leveling guide on wowhead though for every spec.
---
Can't they just apply deserter if you fail to join a game as well, should hit premades pretty hard
---
I think you're meaning GMs but it doesnt bode well when blizzard fired most of their community staff right before the beta.
---
Blizzard is garbage. Don't expect them to do the right thing. You
---
Grab your picket healer and do DM:E jump runs.
---
Fuck black dragon chest. Just get the chest from the chest of the seven has a better droprate and 2% crit
---
ban him/her/it. either way there's no loss to the server, amirite
---
Can your replies get any more predictable, mr ban evader?
---
That's usually what causes wipes, yes.  Great job, gold star.
---
It's 10 :) but I don't herb/mine. I just farm retail 2x4 bfa stuff on multiple realms
---
lol the way you describe them makes bots sound preferable to a lot of the community
---
Hahah nope. My Druid can do anything, but I run dungeons for specific items from them. 
---
I say that when I join a party - that I‚Äôm after items X and Y. Me being in the group and helping clear the place *absolutely* entitles me to roll on them if they drop, find someone else if you don‚Äôt like that. I can tank/heal or DPS so it‚Äôs not like I won‚Äôt find a new group quick enough.
---
‚ÄúBecause now it‚Äôs affecting ME.‚Äù
---
&gt;The only way to make this more expensive for the botters would be to ban  the hardware in their pc's from accessing the game again.
---
They could just play from a VM then.
---
16 weeks later, still stormrage pants have never dropped.
---
1.002% chance of this happening.
---
ugh i dislike people who get up early and judge people stay up late and sleep late, like their way of living is the correct one.
---
incendius? im pretty sure there are two there 24/7. 
---
Night elf one is def a bot, it melees with its pet, will say something i cant read in /say immediately if you kill his pet and attempt to finish the mob and revive lol.
---
then there is a tauren hunter on the east killing dargons almost 24/7. dunno he just moves like a bot. kill, wait 1-3 seconds, move to loot repeat.
---
Bots are a part of the game form the beginning. If you make a massive part of the game mindless grinding, then there's a market for people to bot. It is what it is
---
Because respecs are expensive
---
Here is another one for you.
---
Was in a dungeon. Brd. Edgemasters hand guards dropped. They're worth 800g on my server. Literally a while6rpic mount. And the gloves sell very easily.
---
Now. I wanted to avoid the situation you're in. I always say BoEs are all need. Everyone always agrees.
---
In your stance the 4 others and myself should have let the warrior dps have the edgemasters. They're his BIS and they dropped while he was in the group.
---
But for the rest of the group that's an epic mount. And maybe the warrior would sell so he could buy his mount at 60 too. He was level 58.
---
When something like that drops its "GL everybody" because gloves for the warrior isnt worth a shot at their epic mounts. 800g is a lot. I've never seen that dude again and he was sad he lost the roll.
---
But I have my epic mount from AV and a warden staff. Warden also being my BIS. Plus an epic mount. Expensive BoEs are simply gold
---
Everybody should have a chance at gold.
---
You've doomed Azeroth with this post.
---
I'm on EU. I have 33 active accounts currently. That's EU wow token x33 a month. Roughly 8m or smth
---
Just change the keybinding to B instead of shift-B
---
Not sure if bait or not, but if you see what an actual bot playing wos in-game looks like, you'll know the difference *instantly*. It's impossible to get them mixed up. Human players have erratic movements and uncertain decisions. Bots will move exclusively in straight lines and make sharp, sudden turns unlike players using either keyboard OR mouse to move, bots never jump unnecessarily, bots always cast the exact same sequence/priority list of spells in an extremely predictable manner, and they don't react to being attacked by either players or NPCs in any way that looks human (usually a large delay before deciding to fight back, then lazily walking in a perfect straight line towards the target until either the target dies or the bot does)
---
Hinterlands is so stupid imo. You get tons of quests to kill mobs that are just rare af. Had to kill 20 of these owls. I don't think there are even 20 of these particular owls on the entire map. Similar with some trolls and shit.
---
THUNDERFURY
---
Usually wipes in my experience are caused by tanks who try to avoid packs to save a few seconds and someone ends up butt pulling them while your in the middle of another fight
---
What's the economy like in retail?
---
how can you say bots are ruining bg ranking yet cheapening accomplishments at the same time?
---
Mage is fast to level and you can start aoe grinding zf Graves from about 44 (3-4 Graves at a time) then 8-10 Graves by 47/48. You can make 15-30 gold per hour while leveling this way...
---
No you are right. We are very casual. I just didn't realize that we are super super casual based on what people are telling me. But I don't want to be like this. I want a legit chance at bwl and beyond
---
There is no casual appeal for PVP because you cannot get any rewards for doing casual PVP. Rep or Rank rewards are both a big / massive grind.
---
Aint capitalism grand?
---
Searing Gorge (If you haven't done it yet) is my top favorite questzone. I also hated Hinterlands, I just kinda stopped doing it.
---
Their economy is pretty bitchin tho.
---
Agreed. Anything over 8 heals is boring imo, unless shit hits the fan
---
Oh I'm not underestimating it, I just think they're losing future dollars to not spend dollars today. I think overall it would make them more money to provide more support and maintain more subs.
---
Dude run strat live and reserve an orb.
---
Do DM E and get mining.
---
It's not really about wipes tho. For example a lot of grps play shazzrah with only ranges attacking him. That's making the fight take 6 min and is wrong. You just burst him in 20 sec and then you're done. Small strategic things like that add up to a shit ton of time.
---
This is so true. I‚Äôve only healed as a paladin and it‚Äôs incredibly easy. The only part where it would be considered hard is if your tank is straight up under geared, too low level, or bad. Then you have to figure out when to blow cooldowns to prevent a wipe, or decide if it‚Äôs too late for the cooldowns to prevent a wipe, etc. 
---
Or deciding which dps gets to die because you don‚Äôt have enough heals to go around. 
---
If everybody is doing their job right and has appropriate gear, there‚Äôs usually nothing hard for the healer though.
---
Lvl 48 right now, when is Searing Gorge okay to start with?
---
A redditor claimed they farmed savage gladiator chain with their hunter and had their warrior alt parted and in BRD within looting range. He said with master looter and logging in to kick off your alt he was able to loot SGC to his warrior. Does anyone know from experience if this is actually possible?
---
I‚Äôm in a casual guild.  Started MC about 5 weeks ago.  We haven‚Äôt hit Ragnaros yet but have downed major domo 3x. We aren‚Äôt fast enough yet to get to Rag during raid times.  We are frequently low 3-7 people but more in guild are hitting 60 so hopefully this will change soon.  We run 7-11 healers.  We very rarely wipe due to lack of healing.  The wipes we do have are usually bad pulls, people not hugging walls enough, boss aggro early due to weird flukes, etc,  
---
The main thing that‚Äôs helps us is our officers.  They are active in guild chat, organize ony attunes, share ideas for consumables, where to farm them, etc.  When AV came out, they‚Äôd link av rewards to show people items to go for.  They educate more than ‚Äúhand holding‚Äù.  When someone gets a new bis recipe, they start linking it and generating discussions about how to farm the mats.  Lots of people help each other out farming supplies for gear and enchants.  
---
Discord is active and people post DPs guides, strat ideas, etc.  When I started classic I wasn‚Äôt necessarily even interested in raiding.  But the guild helped make it such a smooth transition, I am glad I‚Äôve been able to give it a try. 
---
The first raid we had everyone chiming in on discord with their ideas and every single thing took so freaking long.  We now have stricter discord rules and having one raid leader who directs everything.  This helps so much.  He usually mentions the little things to keep in mind.  We often have a couple new people each time so he does a lot of repeating.  Then he designated people for calling out bombs or whatever.  We‚Äôve also gotten stricter on showing up on time and being ready.  That can really take up so much time. 
---
So yea maybe you are going a little slow but if people are showing up regularly that at least is half the battle!  Maybe start some discussions on items and consumables to help things go smoother.  You all should at least get into the habit of using the lower rank consumes, example the agility pots one lvl down from mongoose, etc.  get a few tanks on board with doing some guild dungeons runs for upgrades.
---
Burning Steppes, I think.
---
It's not good for magmadar anyway because of random fire pools. Use it on lucifron, and by the time the cooldown is ready again you'll be pretty deep in the dungeon. The next good fight for it (i.e. easy to get it into the fight and not a lot of random aoe to kill it prematurely) is probably Sulfuron.
---
Flamelash
---
A q p
---
What turn ins should I be going for? I need to hit exalted for a healing offhand.
---
Hahaha my Tactic, have max 10 mages, hunter's and locks, just stall alliance and = ez win. Rest 30 can push
---
That is depressing and probably 100 percent the case. Why you do this blizzard, why you gta say poop like that!
---
I will heal reserve runs if I get all non needed stuff.  I have a guy on 300 arena runs I do with constantly.  He is happy and I am happy.
---
I actually wouldn't be shocked if modern WoW's current direction/decision making/balancing/everything is determined by a completely automated algorithm.
---
Right, I don't disagree. But it's kinda like someone having trouble on a Dark Souls boss and someone saying "it can be beaten with no weapons or armor at level 1, so gear isn't your problem."
---
But for the player that's asking, gear MAY be the problem.
---
I had to go back to work and lost the ability to keep up the discussion. If you're still reading the comments, I'd like to say this:
---
Thank you to everyone who came to argue a point. I've learned why there was so much drama last night, even if I don't completely agree with the reasoning. I now see that a strict economic theory is being applied to the loot system and didn't realize that until some of you pointed it out. Thank you. 
---
My thinking is this: if I can use it, I roll need. If I can't use it, I roll greed. Simplistic, I know, but that's how I see it. In other words, I don't apply an economic theory to the game. I'm sure the retort will be: it applies whether or not you want to apply it. Yeah sure ok. But it's need if you use it, greed if you can't. It's really simple. 
---
It's clear that when we run, we'll have to talk about loot rules before we get started. That way, if anyone doesn't like how we're doing it, they can exercise their right to find another group. Done.
---
My guild got 1 Vis to ever drop and it was last reset. Sadly it went to a human warrior that has been rocking deathrbinger since forever. Small uppgrade but still  :)
---
Ehh. You should do AV on your Warri. The exalted rewards are juicy. I did it till exalted and never went in again.
---
Like most things it's probably a bit of both
---
&gt; Also, the queue times are a blessing for the hardcore rankers. You are losing out on honor competitiveness if you even go take a shit as an Alliance.
---
I mean - you can go take a shit in AV.  This is what VNC is for :D
---
Wanted to make a guide after my friend's post of a rough screenshare video got a lot of attention here on /r/classicwow. Hope this helps some mages learn the pull, and maybe it'll even open some eyes about just how good Maraudon XP boosting is compared to ZF.
---
is that drop % chance addon attached to the items atlas loot?
---
Isn‚Äôt it better to make normal silk bandages since they take less cloth? I remember one being better just forgot which one.
---
You'll just zerg Derek if we dont defend frostwolf. Also i dont care about the honor or the rep. I want to summon lokhalar
---
Cash to gold? IDK your server's prices are absolutely fucked. Undeath is 1-2g and Water is 10-12g on Whitemane.
---
2 Hours is basically the standard time for pugs on my server, pugs who don't do gearchecks and don't kick anyone so we often have people with either blue bis or a mix of blues and greens.
---
The only potions required are fire and restorative potions but even then it isn't checked because there tend to be no problems.
---
It's hard to say where exactly it's going wrong without logs but I'm guessing inexperienced raidleading is also a big factor on top of your raidmembers not being in bisgear. In Vanilla we'd usually assign people on the spot, in these pugs everything is done before we've even started as you can see here : https://i.imgur.com/YdE3c4u.png
---
Loot distribution is also something which can take a lot of time if it isn't handled well, it can easily up your clearing time by 30min.
---
To get a picture of how these pugs go on my server : https://www.twitch.tv/rovefogle/video/524519876
---
Honestly don't care too much. I'd be annoyed if somebody rolled on something offspec that I needed but in terms of raiding I don't really mind.
---
I save my DKP, cop my decay loss per week and I get loot. If I'm doing my job well and having a good time I know I'll get loot eventually.
---
Yeah we on a solo mov best dps is to just remove it asap as the first hit is instant but 2 or more mobs you can just keep spinning until they die if the procs stay poppin.
---
OK I'll post. Give me a few minutes. I'll DM you
---
It does sound like that, doesn't it?
---
I agree. Bots ruin(ed) old school runescape, it‚Äôll happen to classic wow too. It‚Äôs inevitable unless blizz cracks down on it.
---
Take everything and leave nothing to the alliance! / 95% Winrate in AV Horde!
---
I don't think that many people would quit over bots. But the amount of bots they'd have to ban? All those bots pay a sub fee
---
There's no economy in retail for bots to destroy. Gold is beyond plentiful and there's nothing to even buy with it anymore.
---
Shit ally pugs aren‚Äôt even stopping at Galv lately.  By the time Bal is dead they‚Äôre pulling Drek
---
19 minutes for sleeping, then 1 minute to eat while you shit.
---
If your guild doesn't require consumables, doesn't and doesn't farm pre raid BIS gear, they probably are not analyzing the strategies that are being used or asking player to use talent specs that are beneficial to the raid. I would guess you have serpent sting taking up debuff slots, etc. There are probably a dozen things that each individual player could do to speed your raids up, but these problems usually start at the top. If you aren't willing to ask for a leadership role and implement change yourself, then I would recommend looking for a new guild.
---
The same problem has existed in RuneScape for over a decade and it‚Äôs an incredibly difficult problem to fix. 
---
Even with bot detection systems and sweeping bans people figure out how to make more sophisticated bots that can bypass the detection process.
---
If I were in that group, I would not have had a problem with letting that dude have his BiS. I simply don‚Äôt care enough about economics in a game to feel otherwise. This thread has made it perfectly clear that many people do care about the economics to a very large degree. We will need to be more aware of that going forward.
---
Actually a lot of bots have jump in their commands now to look more fluid.
---
When did this happen? Even for BoEs I think you should greed if you can't / won't use it. If no one in the group has any use for it then you can decide to all roll need.
---
All it takes is a handful of mages.
---
As a warrior who leveled from 49-60 in BRD  arena only, I feel like I can tell you a lot about farming arena. 
---
For starters if you are not level 60 knock out two birds with one stone and just level there exclusively by doing arena and the loop around where lord roccor is. 
---
The Ogre and Gorosh are classified as ‚Äúrare spawns‚Äù in arena meaning you won‚Äôt see them very often. The good news is their drop chance for the highly sought items are very high but you have to have two rolls go your way. The first is getting the boss and the second is getting the item. If you see gorosh, the chances of you seeing the savage gladiator is almost as high as all of the other items. I have seen two drops and countless banthok sashes. 
---
Good luck on your farm
---
You are not 100% incorrect but not 100% correct either. 
---
You nailed the part of me coming back every few years and not liking it and quitting again. You were off on the part of me not trying mythic dungeons/raids. Last time i played was legion - and i never said mythic raiding was easy, its much more complicated than anything pre-cata in terms of mechanics. 
---
In terms of retail feeling dead. Sorry i stand by this. I played in legion quite a bit (about 7 months) and outside of raids,  the guild chat was dead constantly. Trying to start conversation was met by crickets. Guild chat pretty much became a private lfg channel. I left my 1st guild that was like this thinking it was just the guild. If it was, than i guess the luck followed me because i tried 2 more and both were identical in that aspect. Crafting is nearly worthless from what i could tell - so farming was a thing of the past it seems. Pretty much you pay to play a single player game with MMO features. 
---
Disclaimer - I will accept the possibility that my server "cluster" or w/e was just bad - but the game feels like a shell of itself with harder bosses. thats it.
---
how has it backfired? nochanges has been demanded to counter the forum/reddit whiners and so far its highly successful.
---
nochanges is just a stupid excuse to not act if they dont feel like it. 
---
game is still fun for me and a lot of stuff is blown out of proportion, yet a lot of minor changes could really improve the game while having less negative effects than certain changes which already broke \#nochanges.
---
Well by your definition it is doable. It is also going to be a lot worse than if you were properly specced / geared for the task.
---
Find a dedicated group if it's something you're seriously going for. It takes a loooooooooong time.
---
I unno dude, in Legion they almost destroyed a lot of players wills with being able to fly in-game before it was even allowed.  All that clipping through the air was broken as fuck.
---
Okay (=
---
You can't use the same rules for BoPs as BoEs... When a BoE drops, gold just dropped for the party and it's to be split fairly. When a BoP drops, it goes to the class/spec that can use it best because in most cases just rolling it off and vendoring is a waste. The Need button just communicates a player declaring t1 priority and Greed t2, there's nothing sacred about "Roll need if you can equip." 
---
That's how the MMO community has been doing it for the last 15 years...
---
Because im stating a fact. How many threads do you see about alliance losing av? Then how many threads are you seeing about how long the horde queue time is? If you can answer those questions youll easily reach the conclusion that alliance complain more. Now obvipusly horde bring up the queue times in posts, but there isnt a constant new thread about it like how Alliance loses AV is.  
---
You on the other hand just lose your shit since im not praising the alliance posters here and start claiming im horde, like bro, if im alliance or horde how does that change what my post said? Instead of trying to attack me why not try refuting my post? And the reason is that you cant. Even now in this reply youre still going on about how horde made it hell for alliance and *somehow* I wronged you personally. We probably arent even on the same realm. Like i could ve horde on heartseeker where alliance were camping org, or i could be playing on a pve realm and you still are acting as if im the guy who hurt you lol
---
Could you pm me how to find one? Or maybe someone from EU cross realm would like me as a player? I have 100% mount, mostly epics, and know my stuff. Hunter, btw.
---
but crossrealm is just a shitty fix for mistakes they made pre-release and during release. hell, some servers are even dead with crossrealm and it is awful for realm identity.
---
That statement caused me great pain when I fell on the floor laughing.
---
I can't comment on the integrity of PS's management, but if i was running a free PS before classic and some gold selling company came by and said "Hey, wanna make a deal? allow some of our bots to farm and get part of our profits" then i would prolly be inclined to negotiate - i would even be underhanded enough to specifically target bots from other services to ensure a larger profit margin and competitive edge for my collaborators.
---
Business is business, the gold in your pocket doesn't care where it came from or how it ended up there.
---
------
---
Ofc Blizzard isnt using this method, it would simply be too risky and the profit a gold selling company makes isnt enough to really make the integrity loss worth it.
---
However, i don't think it's financially worthwhile for them to go massively out of their way to apprehend these gold sellers, just ban their accounts with automated systems and collect money from new sub fees.
---
How does he need a recipe to maje gokd with morw than I need prebis gear?
---
Everyone here refers to the current expansion as "retail" no one considers classic retail even though yes it is now that it's no longer on private servers. But he is clearly not talking about classic and means the latest expansion (bfa???)
---
Somebody should make a bot that kills these other bots
---
I get that it‚Äôs easier with a much smaller population, but I find it hilarious that it was harder to bot on most private vanilla servers than it is on classic.
---
I am subbed to retail to play classic. I do not own BFA because i was not impressed with legion (although i will give it some credit - it was better than anything else i had tried of retail past wrath). Yes i play a 15 year old version of the game. Wonder why the oldest versions of the game have the biggest pserver presence? Why is no one trying to monopolize on Mists? Or WoD? Why is there only 1 legion server? Stand on your pedestal all you want - but at the end of the day this was vastly more popular than current retail or the last 5 expansions.
---
Like the age old saying says 8 peoples christmas depression is 1 persons christmas miracle.
---
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of mixed comments about down ranking. I played DPS in vanilla and didn‚Äôt heal much till the end of BC/start of WotLK and I struggled with understanding when and how to down rank. In my opinion It‚Äôs a good rule of thumb to down rank to avoid overheating, and once you have stacked +healing like others said.
---
it's crazy to me that wanting to win isn't really a reasonable goal.
---
I don't turtle or defend out of spite or because I think it's better honor, I literally just wanna win the game. 
---
the other say I won most AV matches right and got like 600 hks for not even 100k honor. was a good day tho cause I won way more than I lost
---
Frostards are the new huntards
---
So what‚Äôs the sub numbers on classic? A game that you deem successful?
---
Yeah man. my monitor is pretty dark and i need max brightness to see anything in caves or less lighted buildings.
---
Who are you?
---
Do DM E jump runs. Just get a shaman healer and split the profits. Much easier than leveling an alt
---
The disastrous launch issues and last minute server creation despite plenty of data to suggest a huge influx of players proves that Blizzard will endure a shitstorm as long as it doesn't affect their sub numbers. Classic WoW being a hit is about keeping costs and the team as small as possible, while generating huge profit. Destroying bots really gets them nothing outside good faith with the playerbase, which they likely believe they don't really need.
---
This jump have nothing to do with class. it was regular character jump, not blink jump or smtg like that.
---
Yup
---
Now you are just wrong and stubborn about it. All your arguments have been thoroughly dismantled and you are offering no rebuttal.
---
A lot of ppl won't say anything and still think you're a dick. Which is completely stupid. If someone asks you a yes or no question and you say nothing then how are they supposed to act when timer hits zero?
---
Bots are just unavoidable at this point, even on vanilla private servers people bot like crazy
---
They should, instead of banning the bots, push them all to their own server. It could be a botbuilding server and they'll all try to outperform eachother
---
So you're saying if a pre bis boe dropped and everyone rolled on it you would be perfectly ok with losing the item, even if it happened over and over?
---
Difference between blizzard and jagex (osrs) is Jagex is willing to admit how much the bots ruin the economy, where blizzard will continue to take in the $15 per bot.
---
I tried 1 more time but failed. IDK about rooftops, next time i get there i will try to get to rooftop.
---
Question. In vanilla, I remember Ally were the ones who turtled with the bridge, and Horde camp was full of holes. How is it the opposite in Classic? 
---
Disclaimer- I haven't actually played Classic. This sub is my only Classic info source.
