I’d say you’re overly mad about something you should care about. If you honestly think streamers are gonna make that big a deal then you have a problem. Reddit has a massive hate boner for streamers, and asmongold not saying his server to stop the extremely toxic haters on Reddit from griefing him constantly is smart. He is the most “hated” wow streamer after all.

Fuck I replied to the wrong person

Pretty sure Thalnos was taking the Spanish and Portugese speakers.

guy on left seems mad he didnt get name, guy on right seems to be reveling in it. lmao
---
Alright that's fair
---
Why it always has to be a 2 sided competition, live and let live.
---
I'm reading this nonsensical quote on reddit so it makes sense.
---
hope youre joking
---
What are you even talking about. They all are on faelina. Look it up
---
Jesus you dun goofed.
---
Welcome! :)
---
Second
---
on the EU side it is pretty clear that we need more english speaking PvP servers since both once maxed out and has stayed maxed out to where both did the auto kicked and you just had to keep trying to log in to the server.
---
Any thoughts between an Enchance Shaman vs a Shadow Priest in terms of effectiveness and enjoyability?  A lot of people have really hyped warrior with shaman.
---
I got the main name I wanted, but not the others I wanted, but overall I'm very happy.

Altruism is back on the menu, boys!

That'd be some f\*cked up masochistic bullsh\*t.
---
There was a happy ending to the Thex saga
---
They worked fine for me on other realms.
---
Its a reservation issue caused by population.
---
I was going to go Faerlina, but who cares I just wanted the streamers all together, I assumed it'd be on Herod. Herod will be good times.
---
What faction will u be
---
I have Loli and Flash on whitemain yolo
---
no shazzrah?
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long answer: Have you ever played Warcraft 3 or the other games? If not, and you have any interest in strategy whatsoever, play the WC3 campaign. It'll put you in the same place as all of us veterans when WoW first came out and we got to see this amazing game turn life-size.
---
Which is why I’m suggesting that Classic goes in a different direction because the current expansion format is by many, myself included, regarded as one of WoW’a big mistakes. Making all previous content obsolete is in my opinion bad and I think Classic should go in a different direction than retail. Yes Classic is an entirely different game from retail and I would prefer it stays that way.
---
Ah fuck it, I'll chip in $3.99.
---
EsfandBless
---
No
---
Im going to say no imo. Only one high population server per region.

Bro Classic launch is gonna be absolute chaos.

Oh well, i forgot that you can only have one capital in your name so I got the name I wanted but that's probably because its a crappy name with only one capital and I don't think I want it now either.

Here's an idea: stop being fucking cheap and buy better server hardware. It's fucking Blizzard we're talking about here.

Not sure what you were expecting after people were pushing the server so hard.

Did this work? Curious, since I did the relog method

Ah that explains it, cheers mate. I hope you got your names aswell^^

everything about the whole thing is so cringy. i just wanna play the game already

What happens? Do they all have to sign NDAs or something to play in certain zones?

Thalnos is the Latin America server, Faerlina is the streamer server. That's all we got for choice...

Would you suggest contacting Blizzard? This is confusing lol

A bitcoin billionaire offered $2.50 for every Soda death (proof with clip). Dude ain't playing the game unless he shuts off stream.

Watch the fucking video. Do I need to do all the work for you? First of all I played and it was 15k peak. But if you watched the video you would hear he said he started an hour or two after launch.

Upvotes/downvotes.

Unless there's manipulation (and I don't see why someone would care to do that) I think it's safe to say a majority lean anti-streamer based on the content at the top.

Hey yeah... yeah, that's exactly what happened.

I dont even know how I didn't see you wrote that.. In my head your sentence ended with "not sure about esfand". sorry about that

My DK on retail is named Nulzak and some people call him Nut Sack. I laugh every time

Literally the only good thing that comes out of allowing gold to be bought or exchanged officially is that it stops the gold farmers. That is it. It fucks the economy and ruins the spirit of the game.

Yea its a massive bummer. Very rare that I go to a game and my ID is taken. Still hoping this fellow finds this thread and is willing to part ways with it
---
I agree that they're still making it about streamers rather than themselves. But it's entertaining to watch regardless.
---
You just need to have a battlenet account and pay for a sub. The download of classic is free.
---
Are they not synonymous in WoW circles?
---
so with my starter edition I can just buy gametime and play classic wow?
---
I know this is delayed and a bit late, but no the folders don't get deleted.
---
Lalatina the paladin, I love it
---
what server did that shitter alex roll on?
---
Sirhealsalot and Mrhealsalot were both taken. Figured the best priest names would be gone fast, still had hope tho.

True that, especially with the land rushes when new content came out.

i was waiting for someone good to start streaming wow on mixer. this is exciting
---
don't do either and be less embarrassing
---
J Contra King of Classic
---
Who got Zoo on ShazzrahEU
---
asmondgold  should host alexensual so he can partner up with mixer!
---
Lmao, WoW classic nerds are on another level this time round (myself included) Healthy re-heat meals delivered weekly for the after work grind and other IRL min/maxing!
---
There were players in layers that didn't even have NPCs in the cities, and had to get groups in order to move into the "right" layer. That has nothing to do with people being capped at 15.
---
But ultimately, layering was being specifically tested during the stress test. So outrage in a posthumous sense is a little moot anyway.
---
True as fuck
---
Why? I get some abuse their powers and other don’t. But why should you waste your energy being toxic towards someone?
---
At the end of the day you’re only hurting yourself getting angry over a streamer on a video game.
---
As much as I would like "Luminous" on Pagle, I dont really have much to offer for it. Worst case I have the name reserved on the other PVE servers but id like to play with friends if possible.
---
some you can yeah, but mine weren't saving them when creating new chars it just loaded the defaults.
---
Who got AZRAEL on whitemane?
---
I will buy/swap for it.
---
Right on thats pretty awesome, u horde or alliance?
---
Careful, he's a hero.
---
&gt;What's the difference between this and just having separate servers, other than name sharing?
---
Try reading the post he linked again.
---
probably fiver or whatever it's called.
---
They will turn on more if they need to
---
Yeah I've actually always been a Runescape player growing up so I wanted to pay tribute but I guess that name is recognized by everyone that plays games at this point haha
---
I sincerely hope you succeed.
---
I just got a new sub a few days ago, like 12 bucks. Never played retail. I just spent the past weekend playing on Classics stress test weekend. So...yes.
---
Honestly no idea, i reserved them on my dads Mac so maybe it’s that
---
Bro you should have definitely waited until the craze dies down. I'm fighting the urge to quickly delete mine to customize properly but fuck doing that right now. Gonna wait a few days during some random off hour.
---
You plan on eating the moon?
---
who?
---
Oh *yes*
---
I asked customer support about Classic and Retail as names on an RP serrver, you'll likely get them changed.
---
I don't dislike most of them. Just asmon saying he can fuck any server he wants and there's nothing people can do about it.
---
Hahah Nice, fuck this subreddit, u all act like loosers. Hope he plays on the server.

wow1 bfa and

wow2 world of Warcraft

Wow1 is my main account that has game time, wow2 doesn’t have any time or bfa even. I click the classic beta option and it just says I can’t access it. What do ?

What? They merged Proudmoore-2 with Proudmoore-1 as was planned all along? Dead game!

\- Absolutely fucking no one

lol im good

Herod

I mean I’m not gonna lie, I look forward to asmongold raging while being camped by horde. I just can’t help but point out the hypocrisy people spit about hating how toxic streamers are while they themselves are insanely toxic.

Anybody got 'Abby' or 'Abigail' on _any_ realm?
---
Yep!
---
I had to uninstall the 'starter edition' or whatever it was of Retail before I got the option to install Classic. Try uninstalling retail if it is installed?
---
Unfortunately he also throws far bigger temper tantrums and demands people be banned on a near daily basis.

That's actually really awesome. Grats and never forget

Alexsensual is such a loser

Grace and Hope for a paladin and priest. Zephyra for a shaman.

Decent bait.

Got Leb, Chani and Avengers.

Not bad.
---
OH NO! Get on my level bro, not impressive.
---
Literally every single popular wow streamer got a ton of subs.
---
God forbid Blizzard sacrifice some cost-efficiency to provide their players a better launch experience. Much better to spend all that cash on "expert analysts" who have yet to actually make an accurate prediction.
---
What exactly are you putting forward as Blizzard's position in all this? That they're hiring these people to predict demand and population at launch, then just not actually taking their advice into account?
---
fuck no

Looking to buy a short, feminine/flowery real word name on Herrod.

sorry D:
---
Hey I somehow just saw this now. Hope you're doing well. Basically I'd say that if you don't want to be pigeon-holed into healing in endgame, then paly warrior. If it was TBC, I'd say hell yeah go paladin or druid, but in classic while you'd be able to tank in dungeons pretty easily as druid when you get to 60 it's not so fun and most people will prefer a warrior. Additionally, the whole drawback of warriors is the leveling experience, which is basically completely mitigated by leveling with friends especially if one of them can heal even a little bit. 
---
Again, don't get me wrong, druids are a ton of fun but " not sure if I really want to be a hybrid class again (forced to heal end-game)" makes me think that druid probably isn't the class for you this time.

How does it feel to be a meme? You’re like the classic version of Leeroy or Serenity Now. You should feel honored.

WTB the name “Villain” on Herod!

---
Good choice my man. Ill add you when it drops
---
Wait, can you clarify something for me? 
---
I want to level as holy since a buddy is rolling priest w me, and the synergy is great. Because of this, I'm going 8 points into ret for improved SoCr, then over to holy for everything else you'd expect. 
---
Should I go improved blessing of might or go for the Mana talent to get my 5 points? My assumption is that improved BoM provides a really good base AP to scale up from as I level through 25/30. Is this wrong? I don't really struggle with Mana/downtime, and since I'm not going for the reduced judgment cooldown until later, I see more value in improved BoM.
---
WHAT'S UP JERKS

&gt; Alexensual is so full of himself. He tries to paint himself as the "anti-asmongold" but in reality he's not even on the same level. He's so desparate that he TRies cheap gimmicks like hosting Ninja in hOpes of a shoutout. Vanilla WoW is his life and if this fLops its aLl over for him and he knows it. This wont end well....
---
I 100% agree 300k+ people are interested, probably many more than that. But how many of those people interested will play, month after month, paying $15 every month.
---
You don't see me speaking danish in the english chat. boo hoo, you weren't big enough to get a server for yourselves, deal with it.

Not trying to knock you but weed is not a drug lol. I've met people dying shooting poison into there veins its kinda  a slap in the face to them to say i quit drugs when you were never on them to begin with. Quiting weed takes a good 5 days of not smoking it lol. But congrats on working out i guess

Selling/Trading Ipod, Blackmane, Latino on Herod

**WTB " Cassiusclay" on Shazzrah**
---
how anyone can feel bad for a multi-millionaire not getting his nickname in a video game is beyond me. sometimes i worry the streamer-fan "relationship" can be toxic, i wonder if some of those people legitimately think asmongold is their friend.

I DID THE SAME SHIT AS YOU BUT ACCIDENTALLY HIT CANCEL ON THE SERVER LOGIN POPUP! WHY WOULD BLIZZARD PUT THAT POINTLESS BUTTON THERE?!

I have kawaii lol
---
Best advice I can give on what class is play what seems fun. As silly as it sounds, if you don't have fun playing the class, you won't have fun playing the game.
---
After you've looked at your top 2, 3, 4, etc. classes that seem fun, ask yourself what you want to do. Late game hard core raiding and you know you like to tank/heal/dps, well you are probably going to be pigeon holed into only a couple select classes as they will excel and top end raids will be min/maxing.
---
Want to aoe farm to make gold? Mage/Hunter are your best bet.
---
PvP? Not too sure, didn't do much of that back in the day. I know Rogue is solid, and warrior is BiS if he has a pocket healer.
---
There's a ton of opinions out there, so you've got to ask what you want to do, and what your end game goal is IF you even make it to level. That in and of itself is an accomplishment (contrary to what a lot of elitists will say).
---
If this helps you make a decision, I'll give you an example of my plan.
---
The joy of Vanilla for me is the actual leveling process, so I'm going to take my time on a Warrior. Worst solo leveling class, but I know I want to tank and it looks like a high skill cap to be a good warrior so it should have some end game fun as I learn to play it right. I'm picking up skinning/herbing. Skins will be vendored for gold to support my money needs and should supply me with enough for level 40 mount. All herbs will be saved in a bank/alt so that at level 60 I can drop skinning for Alchemy and have all those accumulated herbs for leveling my alchemy without having to pay other people for their herbs. I will then craft late game potions and sell them to raiders for my late game gold.
---
A lot of speed leveling guides will say ignore professions as they only slow down the leveling process, and this is true, but I know what I want out of the game is the leveling process so I'm not concerned with how long it will take as that is my main source of fun. IF I make it to 60, I still have a plan to execute to make gold and practice tanking. IF I end up making gold and being a great tank, I will not focus on raiding but on helping other people who need it since I get joy from bringing joy to others.
---
So I have a plan for all phases of the game because I recognized what I actually want from it. Solo leveling a warrior would sound awful to most people with any Vanilla experience, but I'm fine with it. Grabbing professions early and wasting time skinning/herbing when I could be power farming mobs sounds stupid to some people, but I'm fine with it.
---
Figure out what you want, and work backwards to see what fits that goal.
---
TLDR: Mage/Hunter best solo levelers and mass pullers. Druid best resource gatherer. Warrior/rogue/mage best dps iirc. Priest best healer (not to say others are bad, priest just BiS). There's a bunch of videos on YT, watch them all and make the best informed decision you can. 
---
If you read this far, good luck and emphasis on HAVE FUN!
---
someone in our discord got 4 characters on herod

Paul, Freya, Spence

Herod is by far the most populated server at the moment, here was the highest Q i experienced.
---
[Pic](https://i.imgur.com/a6Eklqs.png)
---
All other server I tried didn't have any Q time, and Herod Q's calmed down after a while too. I bet it means higher Q's on day 1 but maybe it'll be a better thing for Herod long term. Still couldn't say more servers are required since everything currently congested on Herod.
---
i just did retard
---
In before workingman104336
---
Lol someone doesn’t understand how any of this works
---
Pat, if you were on my server, I would spare you if I saw you. You did a great service for the Horde.
---
I don't think the login queue is specific for each individual server
---
Moros, Aster and Kuroneko, my choices :) Moros is the main so it was really the only must have
---
The server is the only that has been High in NA since 10 minutes after name reserves opened up. It is 100% an indicator that it is the most popular realm in NA right now. The 10k+ que lines for it would also back that up.
---
ironic because a 'healthy' person can concentrate and play longer than an unhealthy person.
---
It's the perfect plan.
---
Tried to get mage named Ra but you took it! Went with Malfoy instead.

---
Eh, my original P99 name is actually pretty original. It will still be available at launch. The ones I went to grab were my abbreviated names that I am called in guild. These are significantly less original and I'd rate them as one of the higher 3 / 4 letter names people are likely to try for (especially as an undead).

Yeah I mean things like that don't bother me terribly personally because I'm not looking to be in one of those super intense mix/max guilds that is obsessed with doing everything first and they are realistically the only ones who are going to get Scarab Lord anyway.
---
I'm more bothered by the chat being spammed and any areas they are doing stuff in being a nightmare. From the clips I have seen of twitch streamers the chat is absolutely fucking horrific. It's like all the participants are five year old kids... that have just been hit in the head with a brick... whilst recovering from the effects of anaesthesia... during an episode of psychosis brought about by smoking too much crack and they are just smashing their face desperately against the keyboard in an attempt to communicate that they need help.
---
IF chat could be a little spammy at the best and I would often stick people on temporary blocks just so I didn't have to deal with their shit but thousands of screaming morons would be /quit time.
---
I got my name on the right server, wrong faction from the rest of my premade guild. Gonna wait till things calm down in the morning and hope deleting the existing characters is enough to switch factions.
---
That's sharding not layering
---
So what do they do? The number of players Blizzard has been able to support on a single realm has increased with every expansion as servers become more and more powerful. 
---
No matter how much money or technology you have, there have always been some hard limits. Think about how all the current battle royales and FPS games don’t tend to exceed 100 players for the most part because the tech needed to manage all that data and ensure everything is processed and correctly distributed to every single player is bloody hard work, but world of Warcraft launched with 40man raids back in early 2000’s which worked pretty damn smoothly. 
---
What’s the other option you want? Twice as many realms on lunch day just so half of them end up low pop and crappy and they have to close realms and migrate all players somewhere else. 
---
Not all problems can be solved by just throwing more money at it and those crazy profits these online game providers make would not be that great very quickly if they spent millions and millions more on lunch day just to cover that early rush. 
---
Remember in those days cloud services like aws simply didn’t exist.
---
Not at all
---
Is there any way to see this model with some higher level gear? Maybe rogue t2?
---
Camping someone is a bannable offense? Isnt that what PvP servers are for?
---
Anyone who has Osiris on Grobbulus let me know
---
i know,Norwegian here,  it just sounds funny for some reason. See you on Sahzzrah Btw
---
But Vanilla Dwarves are uglier!
---
Yup, that's exactly what I did.
---
I generally reserve judgement until I've found out for myself what people are like. We've all been on the receiving end of being judged by others though hearsay, and it's neither fun nor fair. 
---
Given time I'll know what Alexensual is like, so it's all good either way.
---
I played the beta on the PVP server and I saw pretty heavy layering and people phasing constantly. I didn't even make it to 15 I was just doing addons and stuff.
---
=/
---
they're also harder for gold spammers to PM you!
---
I bought game time on ebay, received the code in 10 minutes.

It was only $11 a month too.

Mine were all shortened versions of previous characters

1. VS - Human Rogue

Are you a popular streamer?

I agree.. I reserved three names similar to gank and I really don't want blizzard to change em. Why is it hard for to community that your character's name can be a nickname

I guess I could port you places for half price

Trading: Cannabinoid on Whitemane for something cool.
---
May you die by my blade with honor
---
True, but that does not mean the other servers won't end up highly populated.
---
Honestly, Asmongold could probably just go cry to Blizzard and they'd "accidentally" delete anyone holding his name. They are never going to support a regular nobody player over one of the guys that gives them free advertising and keeps customers subscribed.
---
This is why you choose the secret option. Grobbulus
---
Read somewhere that it was Horde sided. They gave zero citation though. Who knows...
---
Zandalar Tribe
---
Sure, you'll get some people who choose it oh a whim. There's no denying that. Maybe it would've been a popular server all along. It's just that when you add the push on top of that it's going to make the population swell.
---
I have Garrus and Guillaume on Shazzrah

I think it will be really good. Feels like it will have a good balance, and decent people. See you there on my main!

Hey Alexander, its Ian from highschool.... people still play this game huh? You were always whining about world of warcraft... well anyways Im still banging that girl you asked to prom... Isabel was it? She asked about you the other day, she said she saw you working at the pretzel stand in the mall, hope this mixer thing works out...
---
Can someone educate an ignorant new to classic player why the streamers and what server they’re on matters?
---
I don't get it, is he bragging about no one caring about him enough to try and steal his name? I also got the name I wanted, does that make me cool?
---
No, you just don't want others to communicate in the only way they may know how. If they had options for servers in their language, that would be one thing. They don't, and we're here discussing how to get them suspended/banned for just trying to play the game.
---
Thanks!
---
Yep! It's about to get fucking stupid on here!

three years ago asmon was a niche youtuber who didnt like streaming, and alex was basically the voice of the pserver community

The group I was joing from Star Wars Galaxies decided to go Alliance when I planned to go horde. So I went alliance. I kind of wish I went horde because now  I have an attachment toward Alliance.

time to flood the market

There was an actual agreement to the larger guilds like 15+ guilds that English will be a primarily language in trade among others, grain of salt sure I understand but if true good place to start. I would rather play with a 1/2 server pop. latin vs over pop. and streamer. The thread about the whole matter made it clear to me go that route. Also just because a couple people say it on Reddit doesn't mean other servers on the EC will have a fair share of BR. Either way I / we are in it for the leveling aspect as my gut says other servers will be added with transfers to even servers out. Time will tell for us all though. We just felt be worth the "risk".

Got Pink and Krillin, can't be happier

First good one. Nice m8.

Perfection.

He's not lying though. Skilled vanilla players can and will shit on anyone and there's nothing you can do about it.

I got Stalis, and Atorn Bloodsail Buccaneers alliance
---
It is the same though,  in vanilla once you hit max or hell even 40, then Ragefire and Deadmines were obsolete... it's how progression has worked since day 1

Removed and banned. Haha jk it's low mod week. I'm powerless to the masses. Or am I..?

Fuck I thought the weebs were going to highmane

And now 14 days of wondering if I made the right choices...

Dovahkiin was the only one even remotely worth saving

You should post an update if for any reason 2 of those are randomly deleted...

Pros: some events maybe

cons: no cons

This subreddit has a hate boner thats the problem.  
---
The only people, thats going to have problems are the streamers themselves, they are going to be ganked all the time. Streamer were on the beta, and the beta was smooth af.  
---
If you see a gif saying "INVITE TO ASMON LAYER ETC" that was during a stress test.
---
If Blizzard knew more than me they wouldn’t have made BFA or WoD.

&gt;from the list of around 30 names i have i only got 1

I bet those were highly original and unique names.

It cant be done because it has to pull from outside the game in realtime which isnt allowed

Can I get an "Alex was right" in chat?

Looking for Daddy on Fairbanks horde. I have Onichan and UGH to trade.

Thanks yo. Im waiting on the Comcast tech rn for internet lets game

If anyone has the name "Brad" I will trade you "Eu" or "Right" or "Fob"

I cannot wait for launch. It's gonna be so much fun to see more salt.

Sure. They do.

Doesn't mean they'll make a proper choice.

this is true, i too am rolling Herod and need to put some moar reSPEK on tha name

Yeah Alex is at 1k views and Asmon has no hair left

Madlads only.

This is fucking amazing lmao

Ah, I went for a few pokemon. Almost tried Sciszor

Layers won't effect queue times. Stop spreading disinfo. They literally stated in the interviews when they announced launch date that layers won't make queue times any less than expected and you can realize why that is if you think about it for more than a millisecond. You got tricked by some idiot on this subb
---
only incel losers enjoy alex's content.  get a life you nazi losers.
---
&gt;you claim 15k on ND
---
&gt;steamer says 14k
---
&gt;now vanilla radar says 13k
---
Which one is it, Obama?
---
I can’t take your word for it and the video doesn’t show evidence of population - but guess I can’t argue with vanillaradar. Either way, my point still stands - the video itself highlights the issues of “dynamic spawns” aka having shit spawn the second it dies. It gets messy and buggy. Layering seems like a reasonable (temporary) solution instead of shoving 15k people onto the same realm.

17 hunter vs 25 druid

Can’t wait to start this new journey &amp; I really hope I see some of you!!!

went much smoother than the 1st stress test, so I call it a "win"

By the way does it your surname? Mavric ?

Thought name reserves were tomorrow, so me and at least 5 others are scrambling for names on Fairbanks for the next few hours.
---
Well at least you didn't think you have to reload the WoW client instead of sitting on the realm list and spamming the realm... Didn't get my name and had to use 1 special character rip.
---
Are you saying that "Zeeeebro" with 4 E's isn't original or nuanced? Every vowel just oozes charisma

You're just cranky that you couldn't reserve Thex.

can you not do it yourself?

p.s. Over 50% of wow populace has played since Vanilla including myself.

I managed to get “Aoe” on my mage lol

Good. Half the names I’ve seen people reserve have been absolute trash but these are cool

Interesting how things have changed in the 5 hours since the OP.

Is this the guy thought Desolace was based on the Amazon Rainforest?

Was expecting "Unavailabull"
---
What you say would make sense if people only raided at a specific never changing static time. 
---
Hot take: each guild raids at a time they decide. You can find a guild that raids at your availability on any server. Even oceanic or Australian. Because gasp! Another hot take! Humans are diverse in their play time.
---
So... Serious question. If you rage, how close do you get from clubbing all your Lego sets?
---
Imagine saying “include your faction in the post” instead of sperging out like this
---
Herod: 
---
Gnostie
---
Moglich
---
Ducktales

All are recycled character names I’ve used in the past, Ducktales was the only one I thought I might not get.

Nice, gotta filter the trash.

Trunks: DON'T SHOOT

He is.  The sound of the x at the end of alex running into the "ensual" makes his name sound like Alex sensual.

---
I took photos and ill complain if they do. I didnt break the rules. xD
---
You've got a bigger heart than most others reserving names right now.
---
Bounty was mostly to indicate desire.  The thread just needs to be people offering up their "extra names" or or asking if anyone is willing to give up their preferred name.
---
It's entirely possible my third "why not" name is someone's first pick.
---
East coast - Herod
---
West coast - Whitemane
---
YOU THINK YOU'RE QUEUEING FOR THE SERVER YOU WANT,BUT YOU'RE NOT...
---
Can someone explain the Thex thing to me please?
---
that name is unavailable
---
Sorry I should explain. I have not watched that with audio on because he annoys the fuck out of me so I don't know what the context is or what he was being sarcastic about.
---
I simply meant that many people gathered around one place because of a streamer. Can you imagine how awful the chat spam would be in that area?
---
Uh no I just want to be able to play a social game with people I can actually communicate with.
---
I agree. Survival is the late game pvp best spec for hunters. Better than the other two by far. Also worth mentioning that it’s much better than BM for raids. Oh well looks good anyway

Friends and I swapped a popular 3 letter name with success just now. You have them create the exact character they want, type out the name, then countdown over voice on the delete + create. It worked just fine.

Nope. You should look up Hermès Trismegistus and while you’re at it the Hexenkartothek.

Thanks for the reassurance, I just hope all the servers maintain a healthy population and there isn't any "dead" servers.

Grobbulus! Even if you don't want to RP (you don't have to), it will be a much friendlier environment than a lot of the other PvP servers.

Unless you join a group, relog, enter or leave an instance, or if your layer becomes too full and you're part of the overflow into the new layer

I mean, you seem like a very toxic person. Are sure it was them? You know that saying about smelling shit everywhere you go?
---
Yeah I didn't know that if u keep spamming enter while it was showing that message til u got the name you wanted it would work. So I ended up not getting the only one name I cared about. Instead I had to settle for my 3rd, 7th and 8th name I wanted. So pissed, it just ruins my entire mood and motivation to play. I'll probably just stick to retail now, because it's just not fun when you play on a name you don't like.
---
Yea. His facial expression alone in this picture should tell everyone who sees this exactly what the game is.
---
At least the real Thex will get his name on Herod.
---
Yeah I did that too.  Got 2/3 of the names I wanted once I got on the right server.  Unfortunately, the name that was taken was the full version of my name rather than 'Dislol'.

Kek.

That finger point.. it kills me 🤣

I got my 3 names, but whoo boy. I kept disconnecting and timing out. I sat on Logging into game server for a long while between each dc.

Also got Lazard and UBS but didnt want those. Also got Svalbard

Really really wanting teak though ):

I was very tempted lol. The guild I'm joining was set on Herod though...still might not even work out cause I live on west coast, raid times might be tricky.
---
This is epic
---
Yah not so much anymore, but i remember the first few years of vanilla, there was many many kind people because no one knew anything! thought maybe id start off classic with the kindness i remember.
---
I'm not that cheap.
---
:D
---
I could immediately log in on a normal or rp server though. So queue's are most definitely seperate for each server. We only have 2 English PVP servers in EU, so those 2 will be extremely overpopulated.

That number is who is online not how many characters are on it right?  I assume they'll all be low at 3 AM when no one can play

Dwarf is cooler. More fantasy. Beer. Beards.

Asmongold mad because he caught Alex pumping Pink nipples in his bed.

Yes I think you did ,at least  until he turns heel and throws you through a table ..like in 1998, When The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table....

Yeah, that's the mainstream one. But the others were hard to get as well every time I tried them in other games or on private servers.

You don’t get it. So many aspects of Vanilla are relevant at max level. Lower level zones and mats are still frequented by 60s because they can and need to use of them. The world as a whole is alive. Once an expansion comes out only its content (the most recent content) matters anymore and everything else is just something to rush through, something obsolete.
---
I’m not talking about RFC becoming obsolete to 60s. In Vanilla Azeroth matters. In further expansions it does not. That’s what I’m referring to.

Stay in those then please

[NA][A][PVP] Looking for guild
---
Hello,
---
We are 2 friends looking for casual raiding guild on Tue, Wed, Thur 8pm EST - Midnight. We are both 30+, so looking for similar aged group. Our work/life schedules are pretty stable. We are aiming for level 60 and finish attunements then start raiding in around 6 weeks.
---
About us:
---
Svetlena - Warlock, played since launch until Wotl.  I've cleared everything, except 25m heroic lich king. Our guild lost motivation just before cataclysm expansion. I'm looking to recreate the same character, with tailoring and enchanting. 
---
Suema - Mage, played since beta until Wotl. I was juggling 2 characters, mage and shadow priest. I've raided up to Naxx in vanilla, cleared everything in tbc, then raided up to 25m heroic putricide in Wotl. I'm recreating my mage with herbalism and alchemy.
---
Thanks.
---
noo i just delete and recreate later, its only name reserve
---
This will probably help you out: [http://avoidstreamers.com/](http://avoidstreamers.com/)
---
Right?  The salt threads are gonna be great launch day...
---
Yes that’s pretty pathetic, you’re right.
---
He pretty much kept calling all of the decisions Blizzard was going to make, that he voiced his complaints about.
---
People more or less said “it will not be a problem” or “it won’t happen.” Like layering, for example.
---
Lo’ and behold, the topic about layering exploded, because it has been an awful addition to Classic.
---
So, hence why, AWR.
---
Political campaigns?
---
Brilliant idea, will do!
---
Asmon's girl LOVES Alex's stream, she is a tier 1 sub and sends him photos of her ass
---
Dwarf is better
---
Is this alex person trans?
---
So both look really great in warrior gear.  I feel like you'd be more unique as a dwarf.  I think overall I prefer the human's racial abilities but definitely like the customization options more on the dwarves.  I don't like any of the human's facial options.
---
I do prefer the human mount though, I really don't like the ram.
---
At the end of the day though I'd say go dwarf.
---
Heh Portalcombat is good, well done.
---
WTB the name Duck on Herod.
---
The reason I was wondering how it calculates population, because I find it hard to believe theres that many people just sitting in the character creation screen on Herod to show it as High
---
I got Mankrik on Mankrik... I'm happy.
---
Sounds like you should join herod but be aware of long que times.
---
Best start figuring out what population level equates to a dead server for you. If you rely on a dead server being a feeling, you could just have a bad day one day and be out grinding mobs in Western plaguelands, find yourself all alone with nobody else in sight, and declare the server dead.
---
can you fill me in about what all that bullshit is about thex and that user? wtf I hadn't visited this sub in like months. FOMO
---
&gt;have either the best or worst Barrens chat
---
Depends on if the Poe Lawyers or game enthusiasts win ok.
---
I used your first tip for today's name reservation, and it worked like a charm: no queues, no delays. As a bonus, got all three nicknames I wanted.
---
Thank you.
---
I agree, but I would rather avoid people who absolutely have that advantage going in(and their followers) as opposed to someone who has earned that advantage and control.  There was never one person who controlled my classic server, but there were very influential guilds and players, and I’m fine with that.
---
I don’t want to play with people who are only popular because they have a pseudo-celeb status, and that’s just how I feel about it.
---
Reinstall the bnet client

We've know it wouldn't be Legion for months.
---
I promised my friends I'd roll a horde main first.
---
Then the stress test came and I rolled a human warrior again.
---
Also my wife’s first video game; what server you guys on?
---
Hey everyone! All those kind people who replied to me im soooo curious to know which realms you guys will be playing on! I made an ally rogue on Herod. How about you guys??
---
Have you thought about going horde in Classic? Or maybe not because your friends are still alliance?
---
I made my character, the one I used 15 years ago, saw an error, remade it, said Character Name Taken.
---
Logged off, got super sad, ate a box of cheez it’s, only to come back in hour later to see my first try worked.
---

---
yo what the hell that was my name on Tichondrius back in the day rofl
---
You're still going to have an army of people following him around when the game goes live.
---
Somehow MrBean was taken, yet Flavortown was still available.
---
Sounds like layering lol dude you’re literally arguing for layering right now
---
..By someone who thought they'd connected to a US server..
---
Can also log onto wow, type
---
    /console overrideArchive 1
---
into chat and hit enter.
---
I'm Alliance on my home server Bleeding Hollow, its 75% Horde.  I'll take 56/44 any day
---
Literally everyone I know who was trying to get their names put them on the wrong server. My favorite part was when my brother said I was a dummy for doing it and then looked up and realized he'd done it too! :')
---
You really can't give MM and BM a green hook in PvP and Survival not. Sorry. Also Survival is actually above BM in raids too.. That one is a yikes from me. I do look forward to mage seing everything green.
---
No chance of this happening.
---
See you again someday, Kadazan.
---
Looking to buy Ice or Iced. Hit me up!
---
DotA championships start Thursday so it's already game over for my life

Sorry to my GF lol

How does a zombie look cooler with out bones
---
Spooky skeleton
---
I'm so glad I'm not famous.
---
Cabe was available across all 3 servers :)
---
I only wanted «Ben», tried roughly 30-40 times but was hit with «You can only make a character on this realm if you have a character already on this realm» every time. Now I’m heading to bed sad and dissapointed.
---
Found the gold spammer.
---
Adjective names are perfectly fine on RP servers, people buy and use them all the time on AD-EU
---
Yup.  Some guy was whispering me begging for silver during the stress test.  I told him he could piss off.  He replied "reported".  I right clicked his name in the chat log and discovered it was easy to return the favor.
---
Some people had issues where they made them on the right server and they got moved?
---
oh god what have we done.
---
I want Milksteak on Herod. Pm me
---
Where's his buddy Glock?
---
Looking for «Lagertha» or «Valkyrie» on **Shazzrah**. Pm me if you wanna negotiate
---
If this is just for Name reservations i cant imagine how bad release is going to be...
---
Paging u/bigredditorman I believe he got it. Anything you can do to help out here?
---
Whats the name?
---
Thalnos is Canadian? 
---
Is there a way to see where it's hosted? 
---
Cause' I'm down for my fellow Canuks.
---
Sure I have suggestions too, I think that you should only really be able to switch layers at rest areas with a 10m cooldown or something
---
There's probably good reasons for why that wouldn't work well, so they are just going with the best implementation they can do of phasing
---
It beats having the problems of queues and needing to do server merges, an ACTUALLY disruptive community event
---
Not for a warrior...
---
Wrex.
---
Mfw I've never ever had someone take my name.
---
Shits legit oc
---
You do realize it's all an act and he does love the game and just making money on Twitch...
---
Oh I guess I should have reworded my post. I'm buying the name.
---
Its a good thing for immersion. /trade and /world are not layer based
---
Thex. And no.
---
I'm a 10
---
Undead have very poor eyesight
---
I get it, but this is enough to make me unsubscribe from this subreddit (not that I matter). I think it’s great everyone is excited, but I legit don’t care that you got the name “Lilian” on your server. Why not do a mega thread or something like that?
---
So many screenshots of mediocre names to scroll through on my feed now.
---
Not everyone is even subbed or cares about name saving
---
I'd guess we have maybe half the people right now, if that
---
So you never heard about the tale of Shenna and Crogge have you? Or the Nostalrius devs?
---
LF&gt; Bear on Atiesh
---
Shepard.
---
I hope there's a Tauren on your server you become arch rivals with.
---
@asmongold
---
I don’t get all these odd names ppl are saving lol.
---
In Wisconsin maybe lolol
---
Depends on how bad the name is tbh. If they're gross they'll get reported quickly. If it's just a little dumb most people won't care so long as you're not griefing.
---
Ender of Herod, if ya out there buddy, enjoy.
---
F
---
Everything about today was completely expected haha
---
Who?
---
a lot of the original vanilla playerbase was from other MMOs at the time, and the average age in everquest(the biggest inspiration for classic) was like 35
---
Video games are responsible for mass shooting remember
---
I was a big macro guy through Vanilla and BC.
---
Don’t know if you mentioned stopspellcasting counterspell.  
---
My main was was a “nuke macro”
---
Casted all trinkets, cooldown, potion and use effects.  Mainly use it in raids for burn phases.  It just nice having all the “fuck you” buttons combined into a mega “fuck you button.”
---
If I remember it was like
---
/cast trinket 1
---
/cast arcane power
---
/cast icy veins
---
/use Potion of Speed 
---
Shit was going down when I used that thing.
---
WTT Doll on Faerlina for Doll on Herod
---
Had to zoom in to see that her eyes where closed. In normal view they appear solid black "night warrior"
---
Nobody gets subscribers near the level of Asmongold.
---
WTB Smirnoff on Pagle, $$$ and PeePee touches.
---
Nah, he bickers with Esfand all the time because he cannot ever accept being wrong about the game, and Esfand knows a lot of shit which pisses Asmon off. They only play tg for viewers.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxzxg/the_ever_elusive_16_debuff_slots/etqdv36/ for the answers.
---
Got two servers with my name no issue tried on Herod and by the time I got through someone took both ways I was going to go. Thank God for alt keys I got a name I'm happy with
---
Yeah I was like "no... WAIT"
---
Warrior defaults unite! :P
---
Yeah it definitely feels like it’s coming more from a place of personal dislike. I’m not saying I disagree, I personally don’t find Asmonds or Sodas personalities very appealing. 
---
Everyone is saying streamers are going to ruin the authentic vanilla experience. I’m not sure about that either. They have the resources to create some awesome community events that bring people together. Perhaps that itself isn’t authentic, but I don’t think it necessarily damages the experience. Just don’t watch the streams or join their guilds.
---
Someone took every single officer’s name in my OG vanilla raid guild’s hidden server within 30 seconds. Even some very weird, obscure name. 
---
The salt is fucking real.
---
Now to just give east coast one more server since herod is filled up.
---
I reserved BlizzDad on every server.  Come at me bro.
---
I don't know why you wouldn't want to be on a high pop server (Herod). I can imagine not wanting to be on a streamer server due to spastics, but what's the problem with a super competitive and cheap auction house?
---
Yeh, the dude who works almost every day, entertaining for hours on end, making content on something he is passion about for 7+ years, definitely doesn't deserve it.....
---
He makes people so happy they literally pay money for a service he is giving away for free. Where's the joke in that?

I would think so, but I only got 2 of my 3 reserved and the 3rd was already taken.  They are pretty odd spellings of words too.  It's amazing how many character names get taken quick.
---
Thank you, will check out on the 27th
---
Who the hell took Kali or Random on Herod?
---
'Murica
---
I hate to admit this, but I re-subbed for the stress test once I heard it was going to run all weekend.  I swore I'd wait until launch day but I've been So. Fucking. BORED lately!
---
I'm glad I did though.  I got re-educated on the shaman fire totem quest and I was reminded of the grindier quests in the Barrens that should be skipped.  Centaur bracers - fuck that noise.
---
The land of Canada
---
I welcome it at this point.
---
I love it
---
Yep. Then gotta requeue for the right server... then dc or "failed to create character". That was a fun 45min.
---
you should have remote desktop (of any style) setup for these times!
---
^(The first one is free)
---
No way! What server was that? I grabbed 2 of my favourite Witcher words too!
---
You will be 20 hours behind everyone else then

&gt;It also turns out he has a compulsion to scratch his balls and sniff them.
---
dying right now
---
Cheers mate, exactly the issue! Appreciate it
---
The private servers never had 300k+ not sure where you are getting your numbers from... not sure where you’re getting the statistics for actual live servers either...
---
If the game is that populated at the one month or even first phase mark then blizzard will adjust the servers and allow transfers...
---
You’re making crazy assumptions for the mass populous...
---
Do not forget Blizzard dumbed down this game immensely over the years because the majority couldn’t handle the “hardcore” aspects of the game.
---
This is a novelty for many...a second chance for some...
---
100k que for Herod I bet
---
Asmongold will never played on Herod. Alexensual is on Herod. He avoids Alex like the plague, if anything Alex is Herod's greatest champion.
---
This is the intro for my most recent video. Check it out here!

Kinetix on Whitemane! Where you at!
---
Are you seeing "incompatible" under population? If so you aren't updated. 
---
You can try to kill the update process in task manager and launch it again. May work. 
---
If that doesn't worrk, you may have to uninstall the blizzard client and reinstall. When you delete it, also delete the "Blizzard Entertainment" folder in your ProgramData. Restart your comp and install the blizzard client.
---
I had the same problem earlier and those were the steps I took fix it.
---
Yeah it'll get reported. Just assume it will happen.
---
i got all my names on the biggest eu server, 5hours late xd

Hell yeah dude I’m glad you got your name. What a stand up guy to get it for you.

There was an update to the client earlier. Try closing battlenet and opening it again. Current version is 1.32.2.31446. If yours says anything else it won't connect.

Absolute W for Alex today.

AWR boys
---
Looking for the following names on EU (Shazzrah or Golemagg):
---
* Centurion
---
* Ironborn
---
* Locust
---
Looking for brad on Faerlina pls boss :(
---
I love his passion for classic, but i really dislike how negative he can be overall.  Kind of a debbie downer
---
I think pvp will see a drop off as players reroll to pve once they realize what it’s like.
---
Plenty of people played in the beta
---
I got locked out at 4pm when they went online. Went to see Spider-man and came home and logged on and my names were all available lol
---
He has 18k subs, since he is a very popular streamer he should get 70% of sub money, that's almost 100k in subs alone, and then there are donations and ads too.
---
Sure, but that's a really, really niche playstyle. That means you're not going to be playing the game unless four other people are also on at the same time. I mean, you could probably count the amount of groups who are going to *level 1-60* doing just that on two hands.
---
Fuck! Can you give shoes to Trolls too?
---
Exact same happened to me. Waited 20mins through Q. Put on Pagle without realising. 
---
Made my toons then realised.
---
Had to wait again for my server but cbf
---
Auction House has its own system separate from layering.
---
Will you be playing on Thalnos?
---
I can't see what's going on to the left, is a girl cannonballing girl on couch?
---
Really? Anything for EU crypto
---
False, can choose between game time or balance in EU. Not that it matters tho

Cool names! You and I have similar taste in names. Got the name Torment for my Warlock and Degree for my mage.

Trust me friend, it's my pleasure.

You can heal all dungeons and raids without using any talents. The gear is 90% of your role.

 &lt;**Bourbon Raiders**\&gt; \[Horde\] \[casual\]\[PVP\] \[Fri, and Sat 9pm to 12am\] \[casual\]\[Loot council\]
---
Hello Everyone I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders, a casual Family-oriented guild recruiting for Classic.
---
**Our Goal**: Provide a guild for people that have kids, work 50+ hours a week, and have other real life responsibilities that keep them from joining a hardcore guild. We aim to complete all end-game content whether it is PvP or PvE related, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals in classic we would be delighted to help you achieve them.
---
**Server**: Herod, PvP, EST
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
Raid times: Friday and Saturday 9pm to 12am EST. This as been changed from previous posts.
---
Website: &lt;bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.(com)&gt;
---
if interested, you can reach me on my battletag: Soulmauler#1583, or on Discord: Soul#6978.
---
**To other Guilds**: Whether you have are Horde or Alliance, our guild has joined an Alliance. So, if you’re rolling on an EST server and are interested in joining an Alliance of other guilds, hit me up as well.
---
Reasonabull
---
That aside, they really are quite fantastically done!
---
For sure :) We'll all be okay!
---
Honestly I’m considering rolling on their server because of hype and events they’re going to be bringing to the server. I just watched the video about why someone shouldn’t roll on streamer servers and I found the arguments to be quite weak
---
I AM ANGRY THAT ALL THE SWEARS AND FAMOUS NAMES I WANTED TO SIT ON BUT NEVER PLAY WITH ARE GONE
---
Wanted Kix. Settled for Kìx
---
Hoping special characters won't be a problem!
---
I like torment 👍🏽
---
*Estelaria the nelf druid on grobbulus the only rppvp realm
---
*Jethradon the human warrior on grobbulus 
---
*Zooboomafoo the troll mage on herod the most pop pvp realm rn
---
Got my 3 names. :) Woohoo
---
I had a lock in retail I named it and I loved the name for him.  One of my favorite names I’ve ever used.
---
Probably taken by now but i deleted Chile on there like 2 hours ago
---
There's a strong possibility that blizz subtlety asked them to do so. I don't see any kind of gestures coming out of these people towards anyone that's not subbed to their bs.
---

Still irrelevant to OP's question.

&gt;Everything i've heard about Herod seems mega manufactured and i've seen a bunch of griefing posts about it, so rip that server
---
What does this mean?
---
yep
---
good luck finding some redberry pies you fuck
---
Lol good joke
---
I have both Nuggets and fuggets on thalnos
---
My name is very close to that (literally an extension of that) and I got it on all 3 PVP servers thank god.
---
Just means it's the least likely to be dead in 3 months.
---
Wanted Candy, got Fgjnbvlo
---
I  ugly laughed. Idk what I was expecting but this was not it. I think it's a combination of the picture of a computer screen + the face and name combo, idk.
---
reeeee, streamer, information send, reeeeeetards read, reeeeeact
---
I watched about 2 minutes of his stream today to see what all the fuss was about. 
---
That dude sucks.
---
LF "Cancer" on either Herod of Faerlina.
---
It makes you a big lame
---
But sure
---
Posts like this just contribute to the topic/streamer you don't like. It just makes you look too stupid to realize that.
---
Got Sendnudes
---
And a mage names teleports
---
Alex is an entitled douche, and the private server community knows it. As much of an asshole as I am, he takes the cake.
---
What do you want for that Johnathan?
---
Got it! Thanks
---
oof, I think the problem with this is going to be everyone that doesn't want to be on a streamer server went Herod, or a PST server.  So the server culture is just going to revolve around them so its not going to be as simple as ignore them. 
---
I do believe there are a couple guilds that plan on fighting and griefing streamers as much as possible, maybe reach out to them and see if you can get in on their shenanigans?
---
That would have been galaxy brain levels of thinking.
---
Laintime.
---
Looks like your usual Finnish character name to me ;)
---
TLDR: WAY later than RFC. Like level 55-60.
---
You can get pretty far as a non-specced healer, or even tank, when you're leveling. Sure, it's a lot easier to heal SM for example, when you're actually holy or resto, but very few people actually do that. You'll need to drink more, and things might get hairy when someone fucks up and pulls an extra group or something, but the reality is that you can heal every dungeon as enhance, except maybe the 60-ish ones.
---
Heres the catch though; You NEED a healing set. Maybe not for RFC, but even as far as Wailing Caverns and Deadmines, you want to have some gear with some int, and around lvl 30+, some +healing. Healing gear is usually pretty cheap, so it's normally pretty easy to just buy a few pieces of gear to help you out. It doesn't even *need* to be a full set, but if you put some effort into it, you shouldn't have much trouble at all healing. This goes until about level 55, where I'd say Healers and Tanks should really be re-specced, because the content seems to get pretty hard around there. Then again, my experience is based on a mainstream private server, and Classic dungeons seem to be 20-30% easier in terms of incoming damage.
---
I entirely reccomend  offering to heal dungeons on your way to 55-ish, even as enhance. It's great being a healer in Classic, and you can form your own groups pretty easily. If you ever feel like healing raids, you should also try to get some practice in from dungeons. I tend to think people who jump straight into healing raids need a bit of practice that they missed by refusing to heal dungeons.
---
Just wait for it to rot off and you're good to go my dude.
---
I won't be logging in for about another 7 hours, so I have no idea. Either way, I'll take what I can get. :)
---
So Blizz spun up Myzrael while I logged into Herod and when my characters saved it pushed them to that server.  Luckily I went through the torture of recreating them on Herod again and got it to save properly.

I mean, who cares? At the end of the day people with fans will ALWAYS act that way. I’m not even an asmongold fan boy either. I simply point how how stupid your unfathomable rage for streamers is.
---
You obviously don't know Alex, then.
---
Scarab Lord on that server wont be a big deal at all. They'll probably have like 40+.
---
Since all the top guys on the server will be streamers they can just coordinate as to when to turn in. With that much power at the top everyone on the server will know exactly who is collecting. And honestly because it's like that they are almost at the point where Blizz would intervene if someone turned early.
---
Wanted Thanos, got Thanos.
---
If the person who has Martok on Pagle reads this please DM me, I've had that name for over 14yrs and would really like it back please. DM me and let's talk. Thank you.

Wanted Evangeline, got my second choice, Christiana - for a pally.

I've had a couple run ins  with people who just keeping typing in Spanish knowing I have no clue what they're saying. We aren't animals, but we don't NEED language to communicate. Let's all just try to not be racist or nationalist about it and just work together in our best way possible. Everyone just has to TRY.

None of these are puns, though,

I hope the streamers all play in fucking herod just to make people taking this nonsense so seriously shit themselves out of rage

I was just shocked that Thex was taken. I've had that name for YEARS.

yeah for reallll surv is top tier hunter pvp.

Lol seriously... Snipping tool is a friend! These are pretty good names!

May I spam post a recruitment thread?

I really wanted the name “Sultan” for my Warlock on Herod.  Let’s negotiate!

We can go to the park after dark and smoke that tumbleweed.

I mean no, VR isn't the future of gaming. Its a cool idea but have fun swinging your arms around 50 times to kill a mob. VR is a niche concept but none of the developers ever expects it to replace any other form of gaming.
---
Yeah, sadly lots of 58s dont run ST much. But yeah, as I said, it really depends on the group. You could probably scrape by with a well made group, but theres a good chance most runs will end with wipes and sadness.
---
Maybe, but that is **not** the question  you asked nor the 1 I answered.
---
where can I find all the possible config commands?
---
I'm sorry you guys never played hunter... that's unfortunate... I like the artwork though.
---
You can buy it from an npc
---
Except I was the only person who was going to be putting it to a proper use, so yeah I can be bummed about it. But whatever, the rest of my names are fantastic.

Oh fuck me I reserved my names on Faerlina before I saw this. Guess I'll have to switch and hope they aren't taken elsewhere.
---
So much hate in your post. You call people xenophobic for wanting to play on a server without streamers and Warsong-quality players. Then you proceed to call them Walmart shooters. You pretty much justified the arguments of people not wanting to play with LATAM players. I am glad I didn't go to Thalnos because of people like you and I hope the NA players in Thalnos realize just what type of person you (and probably your guild) are.
---
Whitemane brother.
---
Blizzard never said layering would only be for a week in starter zones.
---
Ion said that they were \*looking\* into having sharding only in the first few zones and only in the first few weeks.
---
Just don't expect anyone outside your guild/friends list to sent you mail.
---
No it doesn't.  Use /who or /2.....

Play Alliance on Herod server. I’ll be your friend.

La-la-latina (to the tune of Rasputin ♫). Good names!

I feel like the people dedicated enough to sub two weeks in advance to reserve names are largely unlikely to be tourists.

---
SO you need to restart your launcher
---
100% agree. Reserving their names for them woulda been the right move.
---
That said, the streamers ended up announcing their server before reservation. Yet ANOTHER panic attack from this sub that turned into nothing. You'd think people would learn to chill the fuck out.

&gt;Can't comment due to account age, but while you're correct that retail datacenters != their corresponding timezones, it appears that Classic ones do match datacenter to time zone: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter_(classic)
---
Is liking the content somebody produces and finding them entertaining called “shilling” now? Or are you only referring to those who blindly defend them and act like they’re gods and can do no wrong. Genuinely curious. Because I love Asmon’s streams, it’s why he’s one of the biggest twitch streamers, he’s entertaining as fuck and does stuff with WoW and the community no other streamer has ever done. 
---
But, he is definitely a massive asshole a lot of the time as well, no denying that.
---
I am also interested if someone knows
---
Reported!
---
And you're also saying "Anything past that, switch," which is straight up misinformation. Thats a much better use of a downvote than because somebody is blunt or rude.
---
I had a list of many rp-names and every single one was taken in half an hour. If I had just kept my place in the que maybe then I could have gotten Archibald for my main.
---
What 'worse behavior' are you talking about? I'd really like to know.
---
It is as if all the people having an aneurysm about the shortage of servers were wrong and vastly overestimated the number of prospective players.
---
Have fun not getting invited to some groups due to people unable to type your name and possibly being forced to change it later
---
To be faaaaaaaiiir...
---
They were the first 2 I checked, also too late :(
---
Virgin Asmongold:  
---
\- Knew people would be sniping his name, cared more about appearance  
---
\- Disappointed despite knowing, instead of expecting the worst and hoping for the best.  
---
\- Asmonbald taken  
---
\- Stuck with Asmonrawr, the dumbest name ever  
---
\- 1000 pity subs  
---
\- Compulsive ball sniffer  
---
\- Likely lost more hair follicles from the stress  
---
\- That name is unavailable  
---
Chad Alexensual:  
---
\- Full set of hair  
---
\- Got name  
---
\- Youthful glow and smile despite not caring about appearance  
---
\- Doesn't sniff balls  
---
\- Horde master race  
---
\- Knew people would try to snipe his name, but hoped for the best  
---
\- Creating Character  
---
\- Clean room and no fucking nasty bugs anywhere
---
So basically no excuse for them to not speak English in chat then
---
The problem is all those interactions can be washed away at any time by sharding.
---
Simple example, if i'm killed by a horde, i will search for him in the zone to pay him back, rivalries are born that way and it's one of the best part of world pvp. But instead he can just layer away (willingly or not) and i might never see him again...
---
Same thing about skirmish, there might be a big fight in another layer but i will never get to see it. And skirmish are less likely to happen if player can just change layer to quest and avoid the other faction.
---
I don't mind interacting with new people a few month later. But i want all the interaction that could happen in phase 1 to happen. Levelling is the best part of the game and that's where all the best interactions happen. Once everyone raid log, it's not the same anymore anyway.
---
That's pretty cool.
---
That's true, I just wanted to save my main name and if possible my alt names. Couldn't get one of them but I got my main and one alt so I'm happy.
---
Did it actually have you in queue for over a real hour though?
---
for starters Trade chat is absolute chaos.
---
Yes.... research!
---
Sigh.. unzip
---
THE server to avoid unless you want eye cancer based on that...
---
it's a meme
---
This sub gets informed through rumors and hearsay, if you want info, go watch some blizz interviews, read actual articles, they said "gone before phase 2" a long time ago already... But hey, keep it up
---
I consider it a long term investment. It will suck at first but will have the healthiest population long term
---
Who the fuck took tiesto on Fairbanks
---
Gold farmers would love this
---
This sub is just toxic in general. No real reason to be on it now as we all know the launch date and the mods hate memes and shit posts
---

---
Wow that is incredible that he has that much restraint.  I wish I could be more casual like that
---
You know how the west coast is. It’s all about them lol
---
I'm still at the depression stage sadly
---
This is only temporary, but we're not absent and we do appreciate the feedback. This won't last long, trust me.
---
If your name walks the line enough you can get away without getting reported so long as you don't piss anyone off. I had a character named Olongjohnson from Wod-&gt;Legion that went probably 3 years without getting reported and it was only because I pissed someone off that it got reported. I even changed it back to the same exact thing (I didn't think it would let me but it did lol) and went another few months before this asshat in my guild that decided to hate me started chain reporting it til I really had to change it.
---
Yeah lol. May be true for you but I know for a fact that this sentiment is the opposite for at least a handful of people on here.
---
Personally, my issue is the fans. I would like to avoid as many kids as possible. I already played on a server that was dominated by edgy kids. No thanks
---
(I was probably one of those kids tbh. But I've since grown at least a little bit.)
---
If only there was some type of clan system, maybe call it a guild where all the people I raid with are in one place and can see my name on a list....
---
Somehow I was able to get 4 names
---
I got “Kevinn” and was very excited. Then I realized I chose a female warrior on accident . Yeah i’m a female name Kevinn what’s it to ya?
---
Ray
---
Randy
---
Barb
---
Cyrus 
---
Trina
---
cheers
---
I love these names :)
---
No idea, but some of the shit he got was too far imo. It's not like he was implicated scamming city and county contracts or intimidating city council members in Los Angeles. You would think doing something like that would make you untouchable by the community.
---
Except doing whatever he wants and is allowed to do is well within his right. There's nothing trolling or toxic about defending his ability to do whatever they are well within their right to do.
---
People who want to control others just to curate their perfect little space would be the ones much better off living on a rock where they can do exactly what you're wanting: Control who plays on your rock.
---
This is good if you never want to be invited by anyone for anything.
---
Trax meme explained. Thanks bro.
---
“Lola” on Fairbanks, will pay cash money
---
Yeah I'm down for anything as long as its something other than fresh servers or something like that
---
There's no Happy name thread so I'm just going to post here that after 13 years I finally managed to get my name in a video game!!!!!!!!

There will certainly be Horde on Atiesh, however there seems to be more Alliance. We have our own [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atiesh/) and [Discord](http://atiesh.classicdiscord.net/) if you wanna pop in and chat, or even just see how the faction split is.

How does it feel to have Alexensual dick wedged down your throat? Every post you make is in rabid defence of your supreme leader.
---
Please tell me Asmon won't get his name. That will make me so happy.
---
Hell yeah it's going to be a party server
---
No one is gonna know how to type ascii characters in
---
So, should I run with Bubble for paladin or Geodude for shaman?
---
Shadowcraft leveling up would be OP in classic
---
Haha perfect, you will get random whispers forever

---
yes that's fine you can play with your guild but you're ignoring the scenario I outlined that you're replying to, and also the fact that the name can be reported at any time for any reason and would be lost.
---
I'd be interested to hear more about your problems with that macro. Have you run into similar issues with my macros?
---
My...what a guy!

I was able to lock my name on 3 of 4 normal servers. Hit a limit and will just have to hope I have no reason to play on the 4th.
---
West coast servers are in Cali while the eastern servers are in Chicago. You can do a ping test here: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7871
---
I'd just make three characters on the three servers of your choice. Herod had queue times just for name reservation so it'll be pretty populated. Faerlina is going to be streamer heavy and may have queue times at launch because of their followers. Thalnos is the unofficial BR server and a lot of LATAM players are headed there too now since Faerlina is "claimed" by the streamers. 
---
Fairbanks and Whitemaine are your only other PvP server choices, both are on west coast.
---

---
Awesome! How does Shadowplay work? I have an Nvidia card. How do I capture clips if I feel the need to?
---
Except Op is dumb af and conveniently forgot the part that blizzard hasn't released any sort of time frame for phase one at all. So layering could last quite a while and will do irreparable dam
---
That's fucking great.

"The talent system isn't as good as BFA?" Yeah, fuck that retard. I would try to be nicer, but honestly that was the only change in 15 years I never agreed with, classic talent tree was pure fucking gold. People like him should be stabbed repetitively. 
---
I seriously never complained about WoW until BFA loot-box system and shit, but losing my talent tree sucked. I'll never forget logging onto it was either TBC or WOTLK and noticing it was gone, like wait wtf? I was never in the loop, so all I knew was "new expansion, hot damn!"
---
He said he has no intentions of playing on a different server.
---
Me too. Got my 3 names so I’m set

Just remember kids, as long as you spell it "rektom" its ok!

I can always whisper them and they can right click my name.

I never care for betas and definitely don't care for stress tests. But I did just sub to get the names I wanted reserved.

Congratz! You got some good names! (;
---
There’s no raid finder in classic
---
Excuse my ignorance, What is a br player?
---
You set a hot key and as long as you have shadow play running in the background you press your hot key and it records the last X amount of minutes
---
I'm not gonna say they diodn't make shit decision over the whole time frame but are we supposed to pretend retail should still be at end of wrath number of subscriber when the entire genre went out of the spotlight? Are there any other game of the same genre who fared all that much ebtter over that time frame?
---

---
Thrice on Herod :(
---
Nah, it's fine as it is
---
Never liked ascii codes in names personally, always felt like a bit of a nuisance
---
So /world is going to look like Mordhau...got it.
---
To be honest it will have the best server wide events just due to the amount of fans willing to all co-operate for the streamer ideas. Bet the event videos they hopefully do will be good. Actually playing there, probably not.
---
Brazillian or Latin American players. Don't be sorry haha
---
Loser
---
Bubble for sure.
---
I tell them to have that person whisper me or post in general, trade, or any other chat so I can click on the name.
---
Someone who is coming back is not going to be on right at the exact time to steal his name. Besides he found out it was someone just stealing it to steal so I guess I do have evidence now.
---
Im gunna report you to the suicide hotline if you level as prot because youre not gunna make it brother
---
Ah yes, classic whataboutism.

Why do you automatically assume that if I don't like Alex then I must automatically like Asmongold and Staysafe?

Keep gurgling on daddy cucksensuals cock you dumb halfwit.

Whoever got covfefe on Herod, you suck.
---
I'm East Coast
---
Just an assumption that would make sense on Blizzard's end so that Streamers can get their names saved for them, they do a lot of publicity for Blizz. What do you get for calling people out on something so meaningless?
---
Not really. Just, you know, could have bumped it back 2 hours and everyone would have had a shot.

# &lt;Saga of Lucimia&gt; - NA - Alliance - Bloodsail Buccaneers - CST
---
We are a group of adventurers ready to dive into Classic World of Warcraft. The guild is made up of a mix of fans and developers working on an MMORPG called Saga of Lucima. We enjoy playing games together as a community and generally hanging out, and World of Warcraft Classic is our next venture together! We hope you will join us if your plans for Classic are similar to ours!
---
We have [forums](https://sagaoflucimia.com/forums/index.php?forums/world-of-warcraft-classic.86/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/t9ZHWNr) for planning and VoIP. There are also a number of members who will be streaming at launch if you're interested in joining in with that!
---
**Leveling**
---
There are a number of static leveling groups with various play schedules that will be playing at launch, but there is also a good section of the guild who are more casual and play at their own pace outside of static groups. We welcome all leveling/playstyles, so if you are interested in joining us, let us know! And, if you'd like to be placed in one of the static groups, let us know your race/class and schedule, and we'll get you slotted!
---
**Raiding**
---
We aim to be a progression guild and to raid a couple of nights a week, with the core of our grouping sessions set around a Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule from **8 p.m. Central until 11 p.m.** For the first month or two, our focus will be on leveling up and preparing everyone for raiding, but once we have enough people to start we'll be kicking things up a notch and moving into the raid content. We will be using DKP with a few twists. (Nostalgia!) More information can be found over on our forums.
---
**Crafting**
---
We have a number of crafters already ready to help the guild and members with their wares, but we always have room for full-time crafters. We will be hosting harvesting nights weekly to support our crafter division, with guildmates earning DKP just like they would on a raid while participating in getting out there and farming mats to keep the guild in full supply of pots and gear!
---
**Community**
---
More than anything else, we are a community of gamers who are passionate about MMORPGs. We have been playing together for more than four years now through various games, such as EverQuest (progression servers and Project 1999 on different occasions), EverQuest 2 (live and progression servers), The Elder Scrolls Online, Lord of the Rings Online, and beyond.
---
While we aren't hardcore, we are all adults with busy schedules who enjoy progression and community without poopsocking our way through things. If you prioritize community ahead of having the best gear in the game, then we're likely a home that you could enjoy.
---

I have a coworker who just barely looks older but similar look. He is 64, so my guess is that this guy is closer to 58-60
---
Damn nice grab
---
I mean his is easier to spell so he's probably gonna catch the flak. I see this as an absolute win.
---
It’s a global release lol.
---
That’s ModUI
---
If this was classic then its probably oUF. If this was taken from a vanilla private server then it's definitely modUI
---
hey man, i got the name Tb on herod id be willing to give it up but i dont know how to do the transfer process tbh i can send a screenshot if you want
---
A lot of people are requesting a toggle option to enable new models. This would allow both lovers of the new and old to be happy. Yet, for some reason, a lot of people are avidly against it and want to force everyone to only be able to see the old. No clue why lol
---
but its just so Sensual!
---
If you choose to level prot you better accept that you are going to heavily depend on groups if you want to level efficiently. Maybe you are patient though and if that's your deal go for it. But I think its in your best interest to get to 60 in a steady manner because raiding will be starting and there aren't many tank positions.   
---
I'm also main a warrior tank but I'm not leveling prot. Stuck between leveling fury or leveling arms.
---
Why would you want only a couple people in the zone? Theres no sense of community. basically play a single player rpg
---
I know right. People have beta tested classic for fucking months and there has been no significant changes to layering and people have a right to be sceptical based off of blizzards track record. Op is the kind of person who gets excited for the next aaa EA title and defends it because he forgot the last 10 years of EA trash. 
---
Classic alpha was i think 9 months ago and now the game is being released in 2 weeks and nothing about layering has really changed. Dont defend this shit.
---
In my humble experience there will be more issues than just that.
---
&gt;  I know I will be a better tank at 60 if I level prot
---
This is untrue. Your best aoe aggro is bshout, the best rage generation tree is fury which is important because prot wars are always starved and you can use def stance and a shield when tanking. It's not like retail.
---
Retail also didn’t just open up a highly hyped up name reservation pissing off a shit ton of people and making a shit ton of people happy depending on the success of getting their names and rushing to reddit to express their pleasure or displeasure.
---
I've joined games and wow private servers YEARs in to their lifetime and gotten my name.
---
Yet it was taken... for the first time in 20 years, today.
---
GIVE ME SHADYFIGURE BACK, WHOEVER YOU ARE

All my names are either original or obscure characters, so I just logged on an hour after the name creation went live and made them all without any trouble.

Locked in my names during the name reserve today! - [https://imgur.com/PKRX2ap](https://imgur.com/PKRX2ap)  
---
Anyone else?
---
So I think we have different definitions of hardcore here. Maybe your definition is right and mine just means meta and not hardcore.
---
To me the more people minmaxing for raid means faster raids. If we choose the best specs, stats, farm consumes, (I’d mention world buffs but I’m lretty sure they will have a large CD in Classic) then we clear the raid 30-75% faster (I only put it that drastically because more serious guilds tend to wipe less and wipes can makes raids take way longer).
---
If I’m correct in what I mean hardcore is, then hardcore is better for people with less time week to week. Casual to me just makes things take twice the time and you end up carrying meme specs, people not farming things they need and as a result making raids take way longer when you need to get to bed by X time on raid night to wake up for work.
---
I know we aren’t all in the same situation but it’s why I value Hardcore/Meta (Maybe I only mean Meta?)
---
Thanks for the reply. Would you suggest re specing in my late 50s?
---
It was more novelty to be honest than anything. I rolled on Grobulus, and wanted some interesting names. The big one I wanted was Parts, so I could be Private Parts. Alas, it was not to be. But then after making my characters, the novelty wore off and I realized that I didn’t really care about those names. I actually deleted When to make a hunter called Schrodinger with the intent on having the ghost cat.

Don't RPers just use a mod to set custom names anyway?
---
I haven't played since Cata, do you know if model swapping is still okay? I'm not talking about editing, I mean the system whereby art assets saved in the correct directory structure will override those same files in the game archives, so you can trick the game into using say a bear model in place of a spider.
---
I used to do this on my Druid to change some of the forms into unimplemented versions. Many people asked Blizzard about the legality of it but they never gave any real answer.
---
This is a good point. I will mostly be leveling with my wife (warlock) or my friend (druid) but when by myself I know it is going to be tough.
---
I was gonna play on Whitemane but couldn't hey my name, so I'm on Fairbanks now where I got it, I see everyone seems to be bunching up on Herod but I want a PST server that's PvP so Fairbanks and Whitemane were my two choices.
---
I have Lars on Herod... name your price
---
Buying unique 2-5 character names on Herod for irl $ DM me name and price if selling
---
if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail
---
&gt;Ryan instead of Newtoff
---
Step up sempai
---
Ah yes, classic whataboutism.
---
Why do you automatically assume that if I don't like Alex then I must automatically like Asmongold and Staysafe?
---
Lack of education?
---
WOAH GET A LOAAAAAD OF THIS GUY
---
What the frick? What's this curse word doing on my Christian server
---
Fuck KD
---
Esfand better not be friends with Asmongold or I will have lost all the respect I have for him, and I have a lot of respect for Esfand.
---
I too am interested in tanking at endgame.  But even for level 60 content like 5/10 man dungeons you don't have to be full prot.  Heck, even for offtanking the lower-tier raids you can probably get by with something like this, which is what I'm doing:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053050213025100031-05-552001101
---
Gets all the goodies out of Arms for casual PvP and farming while still snagging the biggest mitigation talents from Prot.  So if you want to tank your way to 60, be my guest, but I would recommend leveling into something like what I linked above.  It will allow you to still quest should you desire while also tanking the level 50-something dungeons just fine.  If you get to the point where you want to MT for a guild, maybe then think about respeccing.
---
wow classic not yet online, the community is already this toxic. fuck that
---
Fury for the rage gen. Arms was not great outside of pvp in classic.
---
Investors absolutely care about performance.  No, they absolutely do not give a shit about servers, nor would I expect ATVI to even bring up classic servers at an investor call.  
---
They care about income, costs, users, investments, resource allocation, and the average playtime of users.  These are the sort of things that can be quantified by an investor.  ATVI is a public company.  They hold public investor calls and post public reports.  If you want to hear about the stuff that investors actually care about you can google one of their investor call recordings or peak at some of their annual reports at https://investor.activision.com/annual-reports .
---
Why is that shizznitt
---
I got 3 pretty good names on Herod, including Harold. I'm pretty happy.
---
He acts like a child, literally screaming and whining when things don't his way. Its pretty easy to dislike him.
---
On Herod LF: Rival, Mana, Wanted, Prophet, Seer, Oracle
---
Have: Elixir, Forfeit
---
Willing to trade or buy
---
You have to take that poll with a grain of salt though, because it is only derived from reddit users and is a not indicative of what will actually happen when literally everyone else joins in.
---
They aren't pokemon lmao
---
If you like it, it's good. If you don't like it, it's not good.
---
Interesting, thanks!
---
Probably because all of the Americans were doing for Defense. Good name man.
---
This is for Whitemane: I've played a Troll Rogue named Wheels since the original Beta, and it was in-game playing that character where I met someone that would become a real-life friend, and who helped pull me out of a depression all the way back in 2007. Maybe we could trade? I got Kneecap, which I think is an OK name, but Wheels has sentimental value.
---
shill for blizzard instead, you're not alone here.
---
I'm prepared to persist lol. I'm also looking at doing lots of dungeons while leveling so if being prot makes the process easy I'm still considering it.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpmsk2/can_people_pls_explain_what_each_us_realm_is_best/).

This is really funny but maybe wrong subreddit wrong time 😂😂
---
Its spelled with an S. Defense.
---
I got Mystery, Esoteric and Callous on Fairbanks PvP.
---
Anyone who believes this guy deserves what they get.
---
Go dance on a mailbox and make a fortunate like those Twitch thots.
---
DOGGO
---
Sure it won't ruin the game but giving in to retail players demands is a slippery slop that Blizzard could potentially take advantage of.
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to do BRD before 60 then yes, but have fun grinding outside of doing the dungeon. Idk enough about warrior to know if you can tank BRD in arms spec.
---
At 60 for sure, just find a partner to grind with at 60 if you want to grind.
---
Also make sure when you do tank in dungeons as arms, just keep a spare stam mail/plate set to slap on.
---
I got piccolo for my orc
---
how are the forsaken even allowed in China, they are still undead even with their bones hidden
---
&gt; but there's probably also even more people that are waiting for launch day to re-sub
---
Count me in that number. The combination of being 2 weeks out from launch (might have tempted it me if I'd only been 'wasting' a week of sub) and only be able to reserve a couple of names anyway has meant I've not bothered.
---
I think they could have been far smarter about this to gauge interest and demand ahead of time. They should have perhaps let anybody reserve say 1 name sub or no sub - perhaps with a caveat that names will be released 2 days after launch from those that don't sub.
---
Or maybe that would just end up with too many names being locked up from people who actually aren't going to subscribe. Instead they could have done a special deal where you could setup a subscription to automatically fire on release day, perhaps as a reward for setting up early allowing you to log in and create your character / reserve name.
---
Just anything to better gauge interest ahead of time so they can be as prepared as they can be for server demand.
---
The issue as it stands is essentially I don't exist as far as Blizzard is concerned. They have no idea I'm going to appear and reactivate a long since dormant account come launch day. They have done nothing to even register my interest, even a button to login to my account and press 'yep I plan to subscribe come launch day'
---
I wonder how many others are doing the same as me? Seems daft they have not bothered to do anything to capture those numbers.
---
Nice, What are your reasons for leveling Prot?
---
WTB Gary on Herod. Have: Venmo
---
Had to log in a few times to get on Grob. Got my 3. Anyone that thought this wasn't going to be an exercise in frustration is fucking dumb. Literally thousands of people are trying to get their shit. See you all after launch.
---
Please undead rogue next!, keep the good work also
---
This is a basic ass name it was bound to be taken within the first 3 minutes
---
Honestly my guild is gonna be pretty communal with stuff. The crafters get first dibs on anything they make, but they're encouraged to help us all get geared and ready for the raids. After that, if we need to fund raise we can, otherwise the crafters can keep getting the mats and selling them. It's all gonna be pretty chill.
---
doing it manually is sketchy but if you have a reason for it like arachnophobia then you can probably get away with it or find an add-on for it. Also pair it with sound disabling for things you don't want to hear.
---
make sure you trash your house full of moldy food
---
Yeah? Being excited about a game is a normal thing. 
---
Raging at the mere existence of a streamer and whether or not he gets is name is completely pathetic.
---
What branch? I left in 2006 for the military after HS and missed out on BC and wrath lol.
---
Swifty the fuckin legend. But yeah he can get over it
---
I made that same mistake
---
Which really seems kind of weird.  They could have released the names in EU 6 hours earlier and at least given most of Europe a decent shot.  
---
Global launch is fine.  Sucks for Europe, though its a Monday/Tuesday so it kind of sucks for everyone.  I just dont see why EU couldnt have at least had the naming stuff released a tad earlier, and then they could have pushed it back for the Americas a couple hours.
---
Granted, they probably didnt want to have to keep people late, but *shrug*.  Screwing over a lot of people just seemed kind of odd.
---
LF on arugal:

Ciri
---

---
Chernobyl
---
I have scream, and  thebank for trade on the same server
---
You just tried giving one away. It seems like you don't even like them...
---
I never really got on the transmog train. I like having my character's progress linked with physical appearance.
---
Looking for Moon on Herod, will pay a lot for it.
---
If you got Orpheus, Aurelius, or Freyr on Herod lemme know. We can work something out.
---
This. Spoken like a mature, sane individual. Don't give a fuck about streamers, don't want to play with them strictly because of their horde of zombies. I would have been cool with them getting their names early and them declaring servers so it was a win win situation for everyone, but apparently that was a huge problem too.
---
This all makes me wish Blizzard had an April fool's prank where they claimed you could use emoji in classic wow.
---
Not that I'm aware of, but that would be really cool!
---
A light 2/10.
---
how do zombie bones destroy mail and plate armor?
---
What about if I just wanna healbot you boys and drop out when I hit rank 11 for my clout mount like I did 15yrs ago?
---
The classic vg is like 40 people, it's not like you'll ever meet one
---
Super interesting, thanks for sharing! I love this kinda stuff haha
---
Link pls?
---
nana na na naaaa
---
idc lol
---
Plenty of people are vindicated every day and they don't turn into egotistical cunts, that is an absolutely pathetic fanboy arguement if I've ever seen one.
---
I don’t like Kd because somebody else might want it :)
---
I'm thinking about jumping into WoW for the first time...not a dad, but full-time job with lots of other commitments and responsibilities after work. I'm a filthy casual lol. Definitely interested in this Dad guild though.
---
They are actually really good friends.
---
If you can understand why people don't 'get' you being excited over a 15 year old re release then you should understand why people obsess over other random shit.
---
Will get forced name change and claim its streamer favouritism for karma.
---
Deadly, Fantastic, Zoo, Atlas, my first name and my retail character name. I went for 'Death' right away and I had a solid chance at it but it was taken right away. Overall, I am very satisfied. I think I will main 'Deadly'.
---
There's still a queue?
---
Thank you for the silver whoever you are &lt;3
---
Also just to reconfirm, this is NOT my channel. I will not take any credit for someone else’s work. 
---
As you can see I am the very first comment on the video, “Andytheduck”.
---
I’ll see you all in Azeroth.
---
P.s whatever it takes.
---
It didn't put them anywhere, you did. The game put you on Mankrik and you made your characters before checking what server you were on.
---
Get a room you two.
---
Is the BR community really big enough to have an impact on Thalnos? I think Herod will be cancer for a while and Faerlina will be nothing but streamers.
---
It's fake mad as fuck he took time to create his character and had that dumbfounded look on his face while still failing to hide his smile.  
---
It's porn tier acting
---
&gt;  merging dead layers is effectively the same thing as merging dead servers
---
Do you even know what layering is?  The statement "merging dead layers" literally makes no sense.  A server merge is FAR more disruptive than temporary layering.
---
I have Matti but on Pagle, it’s such a good name I’m sorry you couldn’t get it.
---
I live in Australia and somehow every single 2 and three letter word is reserved. Do the math, it's 3 per account, my population is 25 million and lets say a small percentage of that are actually playing, plus New Zealand and Indonesia, how the hell are they literally all taken? It is actually statistically improbable (not impossible).
---
Also assuming they used all three spots to pick a 2 or three letter word, which I doubt everyone has done.
---
Imagine being proud about working in a call centre.
---
Yeah, the PVE RP realm, which is absolutely *not* the same fucking thing otherwise all of y’all wouldn’t be complaining about the streamers on PVP realms and would just roll on a PVE realm. The RP communities will never be unified in one place even if they were forced on to the same server because they’re fundamentally different groups who want different things- thats literally the whole reason they fought so hard for that realm type in the first place.
---
People who want to play on RP-PVP realms but not RP, fine. I have no qualm with that. But the line is drawn at trying to turn the server in to something it’s not at the expense of the people it’s actually for, which is exactly what telling the RPers that they should all just go on to the other server and let the streamers or whatever have this one is doing. No matter how callously you try to rationalize it as for the greater good, it’s a shitty idea and it’s deeply disrespectful. And, coincidentally, very entitled.
---
How are you at playing as a human trash heap?
---
When people take meme names then ask for reassurance because even they don't like them lmao.
---
I don’t get it. They’re the lowest populated servers.
---
sauce ?
---
so I got Arcano the human mage on alliance lol, you dead horde scum
---
damn someone took Hennygod on Herod lol
---
Im more concerned about low pop rp servers :(
---
hey wanna erp?
---
Have "She" on Herod. LF trades.
---
I wonder if Faerlina won’t be as packed as everyone says they’ll be as “everyone” will be trying to avoid streamers.  And as for BR/SA players all the good ones know about the community organizing to be on Thalnos so the bad players will just go wherever as they do now.
---
Just my 2 copper on the issue
---
Are people saying $7.5 because you also get a retail wow sub? It’s still $15 a month right?
---
Reddit in a nutshell.
---
You’ve never heard of swifty lmao what the...

If you are talking about global chats, it's always been a thing. On my server, there was pretty much a discussion on if 9/11 was a hoax daily in Trade chat
---
I was like sweet I got all my names on Faerlina!
---
Checked reddit and saw the streamers were rolling there...
---
Fack.
---
I reserved my original character's name and my 2 buddies' original character names on Whitemane U.S., Alliance. Anyone else?
---
I’m really glad we can move our three chars around on the list. Fingers crossed for multiple mail items too!
---
I agree. I like smaller servers with close knit communities.
---
Dear Random Reddit User,
---
  No Thanks.
---
Thanks for the tip! :D I like these vids. I'm trying to decide what class to play between a priest, mage, and lock.
---
Out of pure interest...
---
Who got 'Shryke' on Shazz? And what's you're reasoning behind getting that name?
---
Nah worship your celebrity somewhere else
---
I don't think you could link skills until like LK? Will make analling more difficult, you have to use like items and such.
---
Who got Sicko on Herod?
---
And we only have 2 servers. I'm worried about the server queues on Arugal lol.
---
Hunter actually!
---
/Plays seal of Casino
---
I managed to get "Zombie" on Golemagg. Had to be quick to get that one though.
---
Much more than 50k. He makes well over 100k a month for sure counting advertisements and endorsements.
---
3/10 if that
---
Looking for **Beauregard** on Herod. Might also be interested in a number name (**Seven, Nine, Thirteen, Seventeen** etc.)
---
PM and we can work something out :)
---
Yeah, didn’t have a single clue for the last character to I tried keem and it was free xD if anybody else wants it then yeah just a filler really
---
They also cant spell Colour or Amour correctly.
---
PeterGankmen
---
Thanks for keeping us safe from it.
---
To avoid an open revolt even then youd probably need to actually call your guild "Thunderfury is a hunter weapon" so that you eased them into the meme gently.
---
You mean you don't spam Moonfire and try to ER while running?
---
Who took Four :( i just wanted it on any realm
---
And podcast?
---
If you want to make it harder on yourself then do so.  You’ll be able to tank everything you want leveling up, just keep your 1h weapon skills up to date.  If you want to level prot out of spite of some internet guys, then more power to ya.  But it won’t likely be fun and the people you want to play with may out level you fairly quickly.
---
We pick up the armor from dead people who died in glorious battle. We do not repair we are already dead
---
That's awesome! I played classic with my brother the first time around, but he's not interested this time :( Hope you guys make some awesome memories!
---
I like symmo
---
yeah you can fd shadowmeld projectiles
---
Not everyone's memorised every C grade streamer sozz.
---
Boogerz / Snotrocket / Skank on Herod. PM if WTB
---
Been Priest ever since Beckon's first video! Hard to play anything else haha
---
If Asmon comes to Herod after the population here exploded because we were expecting a server free of his ilk....yeah, he likely won’t get the scepter here either. 
---
I think a straight up war between Soda and Asmon over the scepter would be perfectly fine and possibly quite entertaining.
---
He’s capable of it, but his stream will be smoother if he goes somewhere where he’s not kill on sight for 90%+ of the population
---
He hit 90,000 views today and made more money today than you make in a year.
---
wtf
---
isnt "cr@cker" basically "reverse n word"?   
---
&gt;isn't an offensive term  
---
pretty sure its not for you to decide if someone else gets offended xd
---
They don’t really have an option, they weren’t given any servers.
---
If someone has Devo on Herod I would be willing to pay for a month of their game time in exchange for the name. I'm a desperate man
---
I really wanted the name milk for my warlock, but ended up getting cakes. I am kind of liking cakes more now.
---
Half of them are retail tourists
---
Defense is the NA spelling, but  Defence is british etc, so it still should be legit. But I get your point.
---
Yes. Nelf can get the jump on people in PVP but Dwarf is better once jumped and can use stone form to peel rogue crippling poison.
---
Don't even know the dude on the right so I'm sure that has something to do with it.
---
Maybe reserved for gold beggars?
---
Any good names on whitemane? Daddy, Woody, Fresh. Anything like those or those. Trade$
---
what's the discord code?

Its a Human Warrior :)

who's got Dallas on Whitemane?

Swifty isn’t just a streamer he’s a legend of the community who’s been playing since vanilla 
---
https://youtu.be/HUPexEfCG7g
---
yeah I had crackers with my soup.  oh fuck I just offended the shit out of so many people because a common english word is offensive just like the n word...??
---
Get ready for those queues!! Herod was so full it actually disconnected you whenever you tried to change to it.
---
fking legend dude, cya ingame. Im ally Herod too!
---
The good news is that all you had to do was delete the character.
---
Let's be honest. Most of the streamers would have just played the game and had events with their fans in game. Anyone abusing power would have been reported enough, streamers have been banned before. Sitting there constantly hating, ganking etc one guy is just sad lol.
---
Very legal and very cool
---
I'm just amazed at the speed in which some names were taken. I understand I didn't get Gilgamesh which was my name on Illidan. But, I also didn't get Mxyzptlk for my mage. Seemed obscure enough I would have a fighting chance.
---
I have a tough time believing that they had a tough time doing in private, what countless people did on camera just fine. 
---
Even if it is true, it's not working as intended and they hopefully reported it in detail.

For real! You're gonna get auto invited to any dungeon/raid PVE and do boss healing. In PvP you're gonna melt faces, heal your boys, and NEVER DIE.

What server/faction you going?? The only thing better than 1 priest is TWO FUCKING PRIEST BRUHHH
---
Yep this happened to me so I've accidentally reserved a name on a different server. Fortunately I *just* managed to switch over to the right one before it all seemed to go to shit.
---
What you mean with 'They aren't pokemon' ?
---
Cool. So you’re what, 12? I was into penis and fart jokes when I was that age, too.
---
lmao.
---
Lmao at everyone raging over layering. Imagine playing on a server with 30k pop without it. 
---
It would be so god damn funny if layering actually ended up being vital.

Resto Druid named floral

yea im sure you were talking about the soup mate

Being able to shadowmeld yourself and stealth your pet opens a lot of opportunities in both pvp and pve.

If its exploitable, people will exploit it.
---
For my fire mage I wanted arson got arson
---
Not someone in your guild, randoms doing 5 mans... one says invite my buddy with stupid name... you can't until they whisper you or talk somewhere you can see... how does a guild help with that?  Invite them to your guild first with a name you can't type?  Good solution.
---
What a draggggggggg brooo 🤣🤙
---
100000% did. Pretty pathetic.
---
I’m at the gym right now and am not going to look for it. There’s a clip of Esfand, (streamer,) contacting Blizz about changing something and Blizz replying with, “No changes.” 
---
If you haven’t seen anything about, #NoChanges, you haven’t been keeping up with classic that well or that long. (Not trying to sound rude. Sorry if it seems that way)

Who got Holo on Shazzrah?
---
Probably cuz it's against tos.

Bloodsail! There are dozens of us!

Wait, are you saying Activision Blizzard is adding some kind of rule about watching streamers while you play the same game as them?
---
WTB or WTT on Herod: Digital
---
pst with terms
---
tee hee hee
---
Enough with this concern trolling bullshit. The population indicator next to the realm is the number of active clients connected to the realm server. I'm willing to bet most of us in the Grob Mob just logged in, made our mans, took a picture and logged out. What reason would someone have to just sit on the character select screen?

Pretty sure it was the Warlizard gaming forums.
---
the streamers are going both horde and alliance to balance the faction.
---
Honestly sometimes if you add random words to inappropriate words it will go through. Like Ass and Dick is inappropriate but if you do Assdicks it will go through... Esfand had Asshammer on stress test too. Idk man it's so weird.

I don‘t know a Single Person with 1 Monitor, Even my das (63 years) has 2. ??????????

---
&gt; I'll say this for the last time: layers aren't servers.
---
When a layer crashes, the game's error message is "World server down" though. The layers are all part of the same realm, but they could technically be separate servers with cross-communication.
---
&gt; If there are 5k people online on the server, doesn' matter that there are 5, 10, or more layers, the server will be full and other people won't be able to log in.
---
Initially this will not be correct. There will easily be 2-3x or more than the target cap, with the cap you refer to being *per*-layer rather than the sum of all layers. The expectation is that populations will decline afterward to a normal level, so a surge capacity at the start is necessary.
---

I have Ignaeus, Adamant, and Mereldar.

no wife or kid agrro here but I am an OG :)

Be proud of Mankrik :) see you on there!
---
Amazing how often that's said. If they release new content, they need to start with more dungeons (of varying difficulty) for the different specs each class has. No extra levels. No new zones. Just new dungeons and raids.
---
Part of me misses waiting in line in the cold for hours to buy the latest box at midnight. It was like urban camping for nerds.

Well, regardless of the class you chose, you'll be good at taking down barriers, especially de fences

This made me smile 😀

---
Duuude. I wanted that one so bad. #1 pick. So annoyed.
---
Wait for the actual game to launch and then make your decisions. Its likely that most people weren't bothering because they knew the stress test was coming to a close.
---
Same here
---
Rly like Coin &amp; Orb, gz on that !
---
Anyone here wanna trade "Fi" on Grobbulus for the "Fi" I accidently reserved on Mankrik when Blizz logged me into the wrong place?
---
What if you're the world's first analyst and therapist. You know, an analrapist.
---
People either want streamer attention for momentary 'fame' (positive or negative) or dislike that streamers bring a complete culture around them that breaks classic vibes.
---
At least it’s not on Pagle.
---
No. 
---
You guys need to understand that the stress test was *very* aggressively layered on purpose to test it because of low populations.
---
Illidan during Burning Crusade was my WoW heyday.
---
Sure but you can turn it off if it bothers you. It doesn't hurt anyone.

Can you send the link for me to sign up for your self help seminar.

“Don’t talk about issues just smile and take what Blizz gives you even if it sucks :)”
---
Dude who hurt you? Why are you so angry? Your posts are all incredibly rude and full of hate. I recommend seeing someone.
---
You cant use numbers in your name unless you spell them or use romans
---
i quit at full t2 and sort of do regret it, but i don't remember a whole lot about why i did it beyond wanting to have less distractions for school
---
here's hoping we can recreate our old journeys!
---
Agreeeeeeeeee
---
That looks really cool.  I'll check it out.
---
Much like the cancerous tumors of an unholy plague, so too does Grob's love grow inside us all.
---
It’s not always a matter of pissing somebody off. Sometimes people are just salty because you killed them or took their mob and they do that shit out of spite.
---
He's such an asshole... I love him lol
---
Sorry man, I got Archibald.
---
Need. Kill.
---
Thot's rat.
---
Witcher
---
However, thank god Herod isn’t streamed.
---
Lucky enough to get my name (Helix) on Shazzrah. 2 Weeks left, let's go!
---
happy to help!! i'll be playing with my boyfriend, who's experiencing classic for the first time-- if you two wind up looking for friends you can find us on the RPPVP server grobbulus, alliance-side! :D
---
My body is the one with his name on Fearalina xD
---
I mean, he's an annoying, cynical, bigoted player so this just reinforces all of the negative things I've seen and read about him.
---
&gt; Camelot Unchained
---
May I suggest Pantheon?
---
Oh ho, that's clever, makes me feel a bit better about this thank you :)
---
But it's bone not metal
---
Im more impressed with bagspace tbh.
---
My girlfriend said that he needs a Lefou Gnome sidekick.
---
If anyone here got wolfrick on golemag Eu my guild masters offering 1 mil on retail for it, will probably do something on classic if you asked instead
---
Feels good
---
Excuse me my son is also named Bort?
---
My friend managed to make a Druid named “Grass”. 
---
Just thought I’d share.
---
Favor/Grace for my Priest. Got Gracious.
---
Sable for my undead. Went with Antipathy.
---
Probably because a gm will have it removed the first week.
---
Grats fellow grobbie!
---
Are you new to reddit and the internet in general?
---
I was at work and some one took my 3  character names i have always had. To BloodRipper of the Horde, I will find you, i will stalk you, and i will PK you.
---
\*&gt;\*Alliance  
---
\*&gt;\*Chad  
---
Pick neither, and join the horde instead.
---
Which one is the main streamer server?
---
When don't I have an erection?
---
😂
---
If you are positive here for even a nanosecond, the basement dwellers will take your head off. Are you sure you don't want to complain about layering instead?
---
Evidence that it happened to others?
---
This reminds me of the ending to Ace Ventura 2
---
Looking for "Radiance" i have Solarian and Teralyon on Herod (willing to negotiate.
---
Original and nice
---
you’re completely right. every sub i’m a member of that has blown up in popularity are really toxic and full of groupthink, nobody is constructive and nobody has any ability to look at peoples views with perspective and instead default to “me vs them and i’m wholly right while their wholly wrong.” 
---
the only subreddits where the communities are genuine and helpful are ones under 100k subs where people are their to actually discuss and debate a subject without automatically telling somebody with a different opinion that they’re wrong and stupid for having that opinion.
---
The world doesn't revolve around California.
---
Can I have sick
---
Oh my god 7$? Let's call the bank boys we need a loan.
---
Was expecting Bombadil, though I guess he'd be a gnome
---
Faerlina
---
...That feels worse than 'just less than 2 weeks' to me, tbh lol
---
Moscato also allowed :)
---
That's a good name for a shaman. Did you drink the way I did lol?
---
Never got emotional and I won't be thanking Blizzard for doing what they should've done when we asked, but I did feel relieved when I managed to create characters without too much hassle, legitimately, without fear of the server getting struck down.
---

---
made it 5 minutes ago LOL spread it around.. maybe it'll grow..maybe it won't.. see you there bud
---
Going Atiesh alliance.
---
I think Atiesh will be bigger than Myzrael? On top of that alliance typically more populated on PVE servers.
---
The only difference for your skills between arms and prot is you'll interchange mortal strike for shield bash, sweeping strike for last stand and you'll have 1 additional move to add to your bar which is the stun. It's basically the exact same setup so you really won't have to learn a whole lot when you switch prot. If you lvl arms or fury it will actually be easier to tank while lvling because you'll have better rage generation which is the real issue with tanking at lower lvls.
---
God damn onions 😭
---
I hate you, but that hate is part of the experience and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I will be the alliance gnome appertif you devour. You monster. You beautiful, necessary fiend.
---
I've done my fair share of complaining about layering.
---
I'm just gonna enjoy my moment of peace after today, maybe tomorrow we can go back to that.
---
Nope.   It will squeeze out some people, but the population of the curious players is going to drop, and herod will be one of the strong servers left.
---
That... is an excellent point.
---
And druglords make even more money than him. Bankers even more than the druglords. So... ?
---
Scarcity is a function of both supply AND demand.  Supply of raw materials usually isn't a problem until you get to extreme low populations.
---
Supply of people willing to craft items however can be a bigger problem. It wouldn't be odd on a small server to have only a small number of alchemists colluding to keep prices and and profit margins high.  With more players on the server, it becomes harder for a small cartel to control pricing and you'll see a race to zero profit margin.
---
TL/DR: It might not be that worthwhile to do crafting professions outside of the self-only craftable gear.
---
Schmeckle is Yiddish for penis, 50 penis’s is a hefty price to pay sir. You drive a hard bargain.
---
One is jajaja the other is huehuehue
---
You love to see it.

Am I missing something, or is 6minutes not a long wait at all for 10k people in the queue?

It’s obvious you are too mature and intelligent to enjoy Asmongold’s stream.

Dude, you hit the spot. When this sub was first kicked off it was nothing but excitement and joy for the adventures ahead. Now it’s just non stop hive mind shit posts about every little detail that doesn’t fit into their perfect “classic wow experience”. Shut the fuck up, relax, and just be happy that we get to play this glorious game in two weeks. 
---
P.s. shout out to all the boys rolling on Whitemane!! See you there!
---
your last name is going to be 100% reported
---
Askew - Human Rogue
---
Haser - N Elf Priest
---
Berst - Gnome Mage
---
\[Arugal - Oceanic\]
---
 All named after my favourite graffiti artists from New Zealand
---
 I was stoked to get the names as they were all quite fitting
---
check out there IG if you are into that kinda thing,

Ok, up got me. Take the upvote you pos.
---
It's a question of whether you micro-manage or not. Whether something is BIS or not is irrelevant (and if you're tracking that level of granularity you're already in the heavily micro-managing set of players).
---
***
---
You can still have a 'designated skinner'  if you really want, but think of it this way
---
+ How would you have handled the loot (craftables) designation in a PUG
---
+ If you put in some more stringent controls, what are the benefits (vs the effort to implement).
---
People always talk about 'BIS' items, but they always leave out the fact that those items are only 'BIS' (from an optimal perspective) if you have a complete set of items (from which the BIS designation was derived). If an item is BIS, but only if you have a certain hit % (and you don't have that hit %) is it really BIS? (and so on and so forth).
---
At the time, yes. All my toons are booze related. 
---
For classic I got Rumpleminze, Methanol and Bowmore (scotch)
---
10/10
---
Fairbanks - Harpua I hope you find me
---
Have Blackthorn on Pagle. 
---
Considered long and hard using it on my Human Warrior, but think I'm gonna go with my unique name I also grabbed.
---
Eh on a server with thousands of players..
---
That's perfectly fair. :)
---
What do you think of these results Bobby B?
---
It's impure.
---
How does anyone watch that? His keyboards sounds are like 10 times as loud as his voice.
---
my group rolled whitemane.. this shit is for the scourge
---
Nice, Pocketdots would also be awesome for a gnome lock
---

It works!
---
I’ll be ripping a few tinnies
---
I don't know who Herold is but maybe they like guys inside them who knows
---
I had several options that I wanted for my druid main. Last night, I randomly also though of the name "Silvers" and it ended up being the only name available. 
---
Works for me though. See you all on Pagle. :)

You sound like Asmon. Stay away.
---
Unbreakable on Mankrik and Pantheon on Pagle
---

---
Had to share: after a 30m fight with the server boss, I got both names :)
---
They can always add more servers as needed. No need to bring out lots of servers that are dead in 3 months because player count will obviously lower and settle after release. It’s harder to close a server and transfer characters to a different one than it to just add another server
---
Me, although I offered to give one of the 2-char names I got as alts to them if they want it.
---
Sticks and stone may break my bones but Words can never.... Words killed you with Shadow word: pain 53(12 overkill)
---
I can tell you're headed for the 4chan server!
---
Its literally free with the base game.
---
Do you know what a cash grab is
---
Man. You sound like a smart guy. I bet you read the news.
---
I guess everyone has had their time with you today... 
---
XD
---
Mald
---
Can confirm. In 30s, just set an alarm to report this.
---
"Yes, you are a titanic rtard"
---
Most of my friend group was on, myself included (Well, when I finally got in that is) - we all really wanted to reserve our names though
---
Do you know what a cash cow is?
---
That's so wholesome
---
"Chat's moving so fast, no one will see that I'm ____"?

Faviourite YT Channel for classic content! the edits must take forever!

I feel the exact same way
---
Vivec , Drizzit, Wulfgar
---
Unless you’re interested in getting in on whatever events said streamers might be holding, I can’t think of any pros
---
It's been busy, that's for sure.
---
Sit on me
---
That’s a dude that hasn’t been outside in a while. Burn some of that energy bro...
---
Cant tell if this is a bait
---
I can see you're headed for the 4chan server. Have fun!
---
Flipcup here. Planning on grinding to at least 13.

---
either way I'd rather avoid any number of the /pol/ crowd. Shame that other people have to get lumped in, but that's the way it is, I guess.
---
That’s the spirit!
---
Low/Medium/High is relative to the other servers. They all had queues.
---
Rob of Herod, if you’re out there, that was my original name from vanilla to legion. 
---
Can i have my name please? My only name of the only character I will play until the end of classic time.
---
Thank you for the empathy bleach drinker.
---
Sounds like a tasty cereal.
---
Yeah, that’s not how that works. Pretty sure Method got world first Azshara with a banned (on twitch) priest on the roster broadcasting to a massive audience.
---
Organically? How exactly is this not organic? People wanted to mass in 1 layer, so they did! Holy shit!
---
Can't wait to see you in Azeroth! Be on the lookout for Lothenar, Human Paladin of the Alliance.
---
all those were great ideas. don't you have a phone?
---
Always tons of people to kill in world pvp.
---
Ah being and active older man who can play games for a living.  Lame ass
---
It sure can't be classic with an apostrophe in the name...
---
I'll add mine for rating: Gnomicide
---
Took time off streaming during the WoW Beta so he could take his mom to Europe to celebrate her college graduation. What a shitbag.
---
People see one clip and think they know how someone is as a person. Maybe look in the mirror.
---
It's like barley 100 people. If that. And those people wont even hit 60. Theres no way 4chan incels make it to 60 to troll to a point were I regret rolling on a server. 
---
You know how many of those same 4chan trolls were in your guild and so on?  A lot. Your so frightened by 4chan lol.
---
Avoid the best west pvp server over a few incels who make it to 20. No
---
You’d be playing in a world where there will be a lot of streamer drama, talk, in game events, rivalries, etc. Which would definitely if nothing else be unique. This would appeal to people who are super into streamer culture (it’s like their Hollywood).
---
I bet Bort was available though.
---
Grats on the 2 then!.
---
I'm still not really sure what was up with the server logins though.  Why people would click on one and get banished to another.
---
I feel like this line up favors horde massively lol
---
I'm sorry. Why the fuck do people care?
---
Um, he's had something like a billion views across two platforms and was the first namebrand streamer in WoW.
---
Why would a bunch of questing level 10 folk be wandering around any of the capital cities? to sell white gear on the AH?
---
this is true with traditional infrastructure but if you're using AWS or some other cloud solution, like 90% of businesses are these days, it's not the case. You can just spin up a few more instances, which is possible to do within minutes.
---
Now I don't know what Blizzard has in terms of infrastructure, I doubt WoW classic is on the cloud. Just saying it's possible to do.
---
Darkstar - my rogue/main
---
Roy - warrior alt
---
Maniac - reserved for my friend who was having connection issues 
---
All on Herod. See you there everyone

Imagine hating on Alex

hahahah this is amazing

---
Yall really cry about streamers all day huh?
---
4/9
---
A quarter of the Canadian population speaks French as their first language
---
&gt; It's like barley 100 people.
---
Where you pull that number from?
---
Tagging on here - any horde guilds on Arugal? Have a group of 5 lads ready to join
---
I tried this to see if it would work, and it did not for me :(.
---
You lucky duck
---
Lmao you think everyone of those guilds will have at LEAST 100 people???? Bro anyone can make a guild these ppl are just trying to hype it up
---
Ive used accents in my names for awhile now. Im like you, i don't want to compromise when it comes to naming my character. Since bnet integration this is hardly annoyance these days. Pst for invite made this a non issue for awhile.
---
Sure if you want to get laughed at

I like the idea of these but I feel like you are just giving people the wrong idea about these certain classes
---
Shadowmeld is also convenient for people who may need to switch attention to RL(family, work etc)
---
Got both my name's locked down.
---
At this point I feel like Blizzard bought some Russian bots.
---
6/10
---
ok so avoid that server
---
It means this dude is scared of a few children that may troll.
---
Because Canada is a region and OCE isn’t

Last time I paid attention to Swifty he was being a raging douche. Karma

Anyone got "Shapes" on Herod?? It was my original vanilla druid and would be really appreciative if we could swap. Let me know your demands.
---
Also "Kgs" on Herod. Its my buddies initials and he's really bummed out/depressed about it. PM me!
---
Looked like he was dueling outside ironforge. So he probably was talking with his guild mates on vent.
---
2/24
---
Damn those are all good gets
---

---
Don't suppose you would trade Gucciboi for Limit?
---
Should get Ilúvatar, Manwe &amp; Fëanor
---
I wanted Gloin so bad :(
---
Ended up getting Thalin, but im not a huge fan of it :(
---
Magichat horde on herod.  Anyone that wants to hook it up to me pm me
---
I immediately went for this name on Herod, obviously I didn’t get it haha
---
&gt;Can we stop with the course language here? It's not only unsafe for children who may be browsering here, it also makes you look extxremely unentellegent, because it shows that the only way your able to communicate and make you're point is too use foul language like this. Smart peeple can make they're points without having to resort to such harmful terminology. Grow up, we're not in high school anymore, we're in the reel world and you damn well better behave like it or else I will punch some suckers lights out.

I haven’t kept up with this streamer drama but holy moly it’s like these people are children. Who cares where who plays? Aren’t we all like thirty now? Can we not be so immature?

You can't spell tiddy with A's

So many fat chicks wtf disappointed tbh

because he knows how adversely he'll affect players who wish to have the most vanilla experience. Him not announcing it simply adds the chance that he'll end up on the server that people migrate to like Herod. This will lead to a lot of aggravation as him choosing to not say what server he's going to only  adversely affects the average player. Whether he announces it or not does not matter for him and his gameplay as no matter what He'll be dealing with the disadvantages of being a  streamer.

[Go big or go home](https://puu.sh/E4Au9/e2c78ad166.png) (I get its still incorrect but the fact they'll let that through?)
---
Just you.
---
What race?
---
I swear thousands of names were taken in a matter of minutes
---
That's a fair point. Realistically I think you're right that any layering/phasing would go unnoticed.
---
I meant that if the phasing was as extensive as it is on live servers (I often don't see my guildmates in the same phase as me on a low pop server), then it would be a big problem.
---
The names I thought would be available weren't and the name I expected to get grabbed instantly wasn't, so I got a good vanity name.
---
So hire 2 call centers full of GMs again, they make enough money. Don't degrade the game by adding in an auto report/ban system for anything other than gold sellers/spam.
---
could be some fun community stuff. Honestly they might have a more manageable population if overcrowding becomes a thing on Herod. Honestly there are a few streamers that it would be cool to play with like esfand but I can see why people don't want to play
---
Something tells me the race that has their heads jutting directly out of their chests at a 90 degree angle doesn't have chiropractors either.  The males anyway.
---
Just a guy that's always used Thex name, and the subreddit made it a meme lol.
---
All named after my favourite graffiti artists from New Zealand
---
I was stoked to get the names as they were all quite fitting
---
I clicked on Herod... Got kicked out... Logged back in straight to character creation and wasn't on Herod... WTF happened
---
Did he have it? Did u pay
---
&gt; extremely toxic
---
I’m sorry for you
---
Gonna be killing you all soon horde scum :P
---
honestly herod might be worse
---
Whoever nabbed jubjub on herod, please message me. Its not just a goofy name to me. That has been my nickname ever since i misheard the orcs in warcraft 3 saying "jobs done" as "jub jub"
---
Just come inside! Its fresh!
---
Coco on Herod? Anyone? Will trade.. things
---
It’s good to know I wasn’t the only one. Names are taken for sure
---
You do realize layering does not increase server capacity it allows less player appear in one zone or area so that you don't have 1000 people competing for 10 mobs. So ya if the number of players is way greater than the server capacity and queues go through the ceiling then they have 2 options
---
1. Add more realms to meet the demand at the risk of dead servers 
---
2. Create a self fulfilling prophecy by doing nothing to combat rediculious queues discouraging newer players from investing into the game. 
---
Option 1 would be preferable imo
---
I can't wait for WoW Classic Drama Time Preach specials to be honest.
---
I too, am on Fairbanks... nearing 40. 😂

---
Hey! We rolled one of of our three characters there after exploring your comment a bit more. Would be happy to meet you guys as we kind of find our way :) I’ll save this comment! 
---
Thanks again !
---
Nobody's gonna have a true Vanilla experience, and if you are that much of a bitch about it, you can always not level on the same server
---
Here’s the oce discord wee fella https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H enjoy.
---
I never thought I'd see you in this sub of all places
---
It’s good to know I wasn’t the only one. Names are taken for sure now.
---
I have no friends playing this. :/ just this lonely girl hoping to make some. Also na must gonna wing it kn game day!
---
I nabbed my 2 classic names of my 2 mains and Thebank for my bank alt so Im pretty happy about that.
---
Keyboards don't have number pads any more? What kind of scrub computers are you people buying?
---
I can almost guarantee you will never run into a pol poster on pretty much any server, dont let that stop you from joining whitemane
---
What's up with everyone going Herod all of a sudden
---
It takes getting reported for Blizz to do something. (At least it did and that's what they said when I was playing 6-ish years ago. Or something.)
---
I have a toon on a retail server named Retards... only lvl 4 but I made him like 2 years ago and was shocked I was allowed to give him that name at all.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Works like a charm here, saves in great quality too!
---
Man inmade a bs name for my main, but my homie sent me the names of his names he kids was feelin.
---
I’m a badass friend.

what server? i have Killer saved on one
---
Hell yeah brother! I'm so happy i got ' Sit ' I'll be rolling around on a Hunter trying to be the opposite of a huntard lol see you around and if you want to link up just lmk
---
Probably “Putin” I think mature language is what it says for any banned words
---
Good, we can fire in any direction
---
Ill gladly fall on the sword and report you day 1. :D only because I couldn't get it first.
---
GODLY - thanks bro
---
Ofc it is like that. Every layer is basically independent world. With so many people and so little realms, how would you like to see 50k (give or take) players in single chat?
---
Rad!
---
WTT "Spyro" on Thalnos for any PvP (Eastern) name.
---
That hat says Make Azeroth Great Again. Man....
---
Did anyone say "All you need is Kill" yet?
---
I like Malfunktion a lot. Nice one
---
Don't worry the Spanish speaking community is also rolling Thalnos with BR. Not sure how that helps you but oh well?
---
Zale over Jamaz? lol
---
Enjoy the ride is what your mom said to me last night
---
You have that assbackwards.  In 6 months when asmon moves to something else it will be deserted.  But it is less popular than Herod at the moment so probably can login ok compared to Herod anyway.

Cant wait to see you in game Tank! (I will be priest Vekilain)
---
Definitely interested in where you grabbed this number from. I think with layering their cap is much, much higher.
---
They revamped the talent system in mists
---
Nice one! I was having a hard time picking a class until j got the name 'War' guess I'm maining a warrior now.
---
Really nice of you to do that. Just from reading the guys post I don't know if would have, came off pretty salty and whining. You're a better man than me!
---
There's also [Dartol's Rod of Transformation](https://i.imgur.com/7EJs19E.png) from Ashenvale.
---
And my favorite, [The Enchanted Moonstalker Cloak](https://i.imgur.com/Vvye41k.png) from Darkshore.  You can abandon this quest and get a new Cloak every time so it's like a single use, super long duration Invisibility potion!
---
Do the Horde have anything like this in Classic?
---
Looking for the person who got Alita on Herod.
---
I thought hoborg would be super easy to get. Pls if anyone took it give it back ;\_;
---
Meanwhile I'm over in Bloodsail like "Huh... well at least I won't have to wait in long. Going to go hang out with the lore nerds... there are literally dozens of us."
---
This wasn’t bad at all
---
I managed to get Hamlet, Gertrude, and Tamoszius
---
If you find me on my gnome, you'll also find I won't be alone lol

reminds me of the destro lock rotation back in the day
---
CoE, SB SB SB SB SB, LT
---
repeat ad nauseum
---
I like all those names, they sound good and are cool, I’m horrible at picking names
---
if what's happened on pservers is any indication, 90% of people will get burned out at level 20 and quit after a week. That's why people want a high pop server.
---
Yeah but in the past, low medium and high refer to specific number ranges. Now when a server says hi it could mean 10,000 or a hundred thousand.
---
Found this in the archived wowhead comment section:
---
"This is still sitting in my bank. It's the only one I have. It's not possible to get another one. Once it's used, it's gone forever.
---
When I look at it I think, the day will come when nightfall descends upon the world, and the flame of life is beset on all sides by deepest shadow, my comrades perished at my feet, my body near breaking point, doom descending on me swift and merciless... and in that moment, alone in the darkness, with my last ounce of strength I shall hold aloft this vial and cry out to the Moon herself to grant me just ten more seconds of life, and that will be the most glorious moment in all my life.
---
And then I think, holy poop that is too much pressure, and I put it back in my bank, my mouse hand trembling."
---
I hit the lotto. I got Spy, Prime, and Six.
---
Mfker, I had a accent U in my rogues name since original vanilla and have done all manner of evil things to the horde in open world. Never had a single problem.
---
Alt codes for certain letters are pretty dame easy to memorize. ø (alt-0248) can be memorized as multiplying 2, ö (alt-0246) is literally +2 4 times, if you hear that once and cant remember it idk what to even tell you, ê (alt-0234) is really easy, ä (alt-0228) isnt too bad if your name has an "a" and no other vowels, ect. ect. Just make sure you dont have your first letter a alt code, unless its Ð (alt-0208), because the lowercase for that letter is ð. But with most of these just saying the alt code will get you by no problem, maybe just a slight annoyance. Long names with lots of alt codes is a pain in the ass tho, dont name yourself Åšmøňgøłd, I wouldent even bother try with that one. Short names with one alt code should be fine. Just hope that over 15 years of experience on computers people know what an alt code is.

What does having a phone have to do with trusting blizzard to interpret the population data they see?
---
What makes you think Herod will be cancer?
---
yeah the fact that there is a complaint megathread and a trades megathread and no celebration thread says more about this community than I ever could.
---
Now you've got me worried. Haven't bothered to reserve my name yet, didn't think I'd have any trouble getting my name.
---
Here’s the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTfTNjcThmoe_47K8mbf8IffpfK0XrBCFWE4X5X97wY/htmlview
---
Had Nolo jacked:( out of all my names i didnt think it would be the one taken. Thank god the wifey nabbed my other two
---
If you don't want gear dependant, go Hunter.  
---
If you want to eventually get some gear, warlock &gt; priest &gt; hunter will be the pecking order. Just depends on how long you want to play/how much time you want to sink into the character.
---
How did you run dire maul at 15?
---
Not my point
---
If the forums are any indication, it’s a PvP server with slightly stricter naming conventions. Hardly any of the posts about Grob are about the RP and the ones that are are just “I’m not gonna RP and you can’t make me” 
---
When I played on Emerald Dream, most of the RP was guild only and just tavern nights. I’m bummed about it to be honest. I was really looking forward to RPing and PvPing out in the world.
---
Fuck. Thank you to this subreddit and this post for showing me to reroll on Herod. I created characters on Faerlina with no thought that it could be heavily streamer populated. Phew.
---
Me too, I miss my name :(
---
It's because small subs have people there to discuss the topic because of their common interest, knowing that only a tiny group will actually see their viewpoint.
---
Meanwhile big subs, while still having ample discussions, also have people who go there simply because they will have a crowd for their soapbox speech.

Best name so far
---
That, my friend, is the great Sal Bundry.  He once threw 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school.
---
Agreed, tried grouping with my friend numerous times and she even in my party was in a different layer, I'd have to drop party a few times before it worked, sometimes even having to log.
---
It's hogwash to be certain.
---
5% according to reddit survey so no.
---
1/1. None of my IRL friends game, let alone MMORPG.
---
So lonely.
---
Korso, Buddy and Mirror
---
Druid dick? Interesting
---
i have been foiled by the fivehead

Und die lieben Schweizer nicht vergessen. Zu tbc zeiten hab ich in einer schweizer Gilde als Ösi gespielt. Teamspeak klang nie wieder so sympathisch wie damals
---
I'll hit you up in 10 hours to let you know how it impacted me.
---
HAIL THEX. GO WITH HONOR, I WILL SEE YOU UPON THE BATTLEFIELD!
---
If anything you should feel good about it, a higher pop means after players quit it will still be a decent size
---
I tried to, got dumped to Pagle somehow. I wonder if anyone wants to do some name trades &gt;.&lt;
---
Anyone got sir sird or sirde on whitemane?
---
this is where i'm stuck. i'm thinking realistically thalnos won't be super packed with latinos/brazillians and it will be just a co-exist atmosphere that you have on retail PVP servers. 
---
Herod was my first choice when the list dropped, but now with the population i'm second guessing it with that 10k name queue. it's absurd
---
Herod is a solid choice. No streamers and after the hype is over I feel like Herod will level out well and form a genuine community.
---
Seconded! Sail toward fairer banks.
---
Sometimes they just come to me, sometimes they don't.  Some of the ones that come to me are so obvious everyone takes them.
---
I have a few more I think are less likely to get stolen, and a few more I think will be stolen (but I wasn't as attached to them as these three).
---
For example, for the Paladin I have about 30 names that I'm guessing will all be taken by launch day.  For the Rogue and Warlock I don't yet have any names I REALLY like, and if I didn't get any of these three, I'd have been lost on these classes.
---
One lesson I am glad to have learned early in life is that your friends don’t want you to change or grow because you will know longer be the person they are used to you being and that threatens their idea of you. I am very selective of the people I let in my life now.
---
I can't tell if you're a troll or just have some major anger issue
---
Damn I feel like an idiot for going Faerlina.  I saw some people mention it so I reserved my toons there, but everyone is making it seem like shit because of streamers, and saying Herod is best.
---
Is it though? Its late night now, on name reservation day. Of the U.S. servers only 1 is full, the rest are Medium and Low.
---
I really have to ask.... Remember those people that were saying we need at LEAST 40 servers? I mean, I expect that there will be a few more full servers by weeks end.... but 40?Im starting to think the community was wrong on that.
---
There was a lot of DC's and after you reserved your name you didn't have anything to do so the turnover rate was high.
---
kek
---
Nothing wrong with playing on Medium server, especially if it's consistent.
---
do you honestly think that
---
how many blizz devs or designers even really play there own game anymore
---
or the famous *you think you do but you dont*
---
blizzard is fairly out of touch with whats fun or what people want dont forget most of the staff that actually made the game are long gone
---
Fuck.
---
I played myself.
---
I meant deadmines :(
---
I shouldn't have rolled alliance on Herod...
---
Asmongold vs who?
---
Ridley, Prez, and Bellator on Fairbanks.
---
Secured Homelander on Herod - may not even play, I don't know.
---
Revy and Saffron!
---
INVITE TO ASMON LAIR
---
Someone in my guild got 5, not sure what happened to allow that.  Hope no one got shafted and was only allowed 2
---
Casterlyrock, weekend, Mohammad
---
Can someone fill me in on the drama and how the servers are being divided
---
Logged in Hella late, and got my name, BuckTuft the anagramical troll priest.
---
are you my mom when i was 6?
---
Ah thats a total bummer!
---
You what you must do know before launch.
---
Similar vibe for me. His actual content/thoughts are pretty solid but the whole incel/redpill boy dictionary is just too much for me.
---
Looking for Beo on Pagle! could at very least pay some gold on retail thanks!
---
Help swifty the legend please
---
I managed to get my moms name, after getting her blessing of course, after she got off from work.
---
You can res them till the 26th I think.
---
I'm kinda afraid of faction balance, it seems like 80% horde. Hope blizz give us some info on that
---
Lmfao, they got that Fisher Price babies first pc
---
Oof. Level 20. Think ya can crank out a level 5 ragefire or wailing caverns by the weekend? :P
---
I had Narsil on Atiesh but my friends complained about playing PVE so I ended up losing it.
---
Approved by Herod gang.
---
He gets mad and its the same footage on the screen lmao he's not even actually playing.
---
I've only played like 20hrs of runesccape growing up and that's the only player name I know of, so yeah.
---
Whoever took the name Asmongold is going to be camped to hell by his followers.
---
Worth.
---
T H E X
---
Have some dignity.
---
Hey, thanks for taking your time coming up with fun Ben-like names! I just prefer short names and «Ben» feels like a dwarf to me. ~ Totally not because I’m a short Ben irl of course, haha!
---
Athene?
---
I have nothing to gain from not using pots. If it means I survive I frankly couldn't give a shit if someone made fun of me for it. Honor in video games... ha.
---
Went thanks because people are really blowing the Latin aspect out of proportion. Even if it is half Latin you have half the server that isnt...
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

lol whiny ass bitch. is this comment for real?
---
Imagine reposting the same video over and over
---
Missbanana.. good choice.
---
A very green, angry Orc Warlock lol.
---
I got the named Adelwind, Grimm, and Griselda for rp characters.
---
And.? The pings gonna be in the 80s at worst, which was probably not from the norm in vanilla.
---
Les than two! It's slightly less than two! I keep telling myself it's less than two... It's not helping.
---
LF Wain on Herod :(
---
Nah hes playing up a character like doc I dont really care he accomplished redditmad perfectly
---
The game isn't out yet, it doesn't feel like anything
---
Get a load of this guy, I mean seriously.
---
LOL. That's a make azeroth great again hat.
---
Isn't that literally what the streamers were generally talking about doing? Controlling everyone by using their fan base to black list people they don't like?
---
Both did actually
---
Yet there are more Portuguese speakers in South America than there are Spanish speakers.
---
I’d watch them stream this.
---
O kurwa!  
---
As a Scandinavian you're welcome to feast with us, brothers!
---
Imagine thinking a 500 player stress test with layers will feel the same as a 20k player launch with layers
---
I got Athene
---
yeah after months of this sub calling him a scumbag he's gotta play nice.
---
he even followed the other streamers to faerlina and people still mad
---
It's 67 to 33 right now I believe
---
"sweden person"
---
مرحبا اخي ?
---
Is it not harrassment when a player named “Asmonkiller” in a guild called “asmonkillers” gets on the instant a streamer starts streaming to camp npc’s and repeatedly kill the streamer every single day for months?
---
I’ve seen it before that there is an EXTENT to what is considered okay and not okay when it comes to ganking other players. And the lengths these streamer haters are going, is damn near harassment and that violates the ToS.
---
Staves out boys
---
Hell yeah
---
I am very smart thank you for noticing but that doesn't excuse your deplorable behavior.
---
I was talking about alex
---
I think people thought I was calling the guy who said who a retard
---
🤷‍♀️
---
Shadowmeld - Aimed Shot, Auto, Multi Shot, Auto, Sting, Auto Dead peeps. Fun times.
---
No they didn't
---
It's also way better for pvp.
---
guys remember when leeway wasn't in vanilla wow?
---
https://youtu.be/4sj21TAmQ-M?t=123

Honestly 4chan is no worse than twitch chat
---
I was able to get the name "Remains" for my undead, after I lost my first pick.
---
Where did he say this? Please show mee a clip, or a vod. This would have been on any of these sources Like [this](http://avoidstreamers.com/) or sodapoppin would have confirmed where he was going but even he doesn't know [as you can see here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/302680451565355009/610656871451197446/x3tql7yuf2g31.png)
---
Why do people defend his shitty actions ?
---
Agreed
---
Was considering naming one of my characters Inoculum or Lateralus
---
Happy cake day to you too then
---
Rouge on Herod :( I'd do anything for that name
---
He has the analytics and has showed them on stream.
---
Whatever your idea of fun is
---
same, i like the simple, actual real world, names (of course Tim and Bob were taken)  
---
good thing there are some names in dutch that are taken less often, so I'm happy with Fons.
---
seeing you rolled tauren, I'm (only slightly) dissapointed you didn't go with moodrow.
---
no u
---
Or people in EU who have to sleep before their next day day jobs :)
---
No kidding. It's one thing to think or say "Yeah, don't really like them much" but it's completely different when people here lose their minds and foam at the mouth over them.
---
No you both
---
3/4 of the continental US were at work when it went live.
---
But that’s not an RP server?
---
Pagle— I wanted to roll either a pvp or rp server, but all my friends are rolling pve. Life is a series of compromises :^(
---
A friend of mine got senpai on Faerlina lol
---
yea having all the possible healing gear options is a definite plus
---
Think the guy who said a mil probably meant in a year which he definitely clears
---
A meme I saw like 5 years ago and whenever it pops into my head I chuckle
---
Parabola, Lateralus, Stinkfist, Schism were all taken on every other server.
---
Funny thing is, I actually stopped to customize my character to how I wanted it. 
---
I got lucky.
---
I didn't get mine either my dood
---
The streamers literally couldn't afford to call the pvp guilds bluff. The streamers livelihood relies on their audience. If the streamers can't play more than 5 minutes without being spawn camped then their quality of stream goes through the floor and their viewer numbers go down and they can't sustain themselves. The pvp guilds knew that they could stream snipe the streamers and make their playing experience completely horrible with very little repercussions. The streamers knew it as well so they chose to back down. It all comes down to money in the end.
---
GROB MOB
---
Lol youre forgetting a few things. I played MMO's before vanilla was even a thing, but never touched WoW cause my friends were into other games at that period in my life. Coming into classic brings back nostalgic gaming vibes AND im getting to experience what you did from back then as well as meet new friends along the way.
---
Supposedly a sub got it for him.
---
Fox!
---
Breathe.
---
General Martok? An honorable warrior name. Qapla!
---
(I’ll see myself out and go to r/startrek)
---
I hope so
---
Willing to trade "Kitty" on Faerlina. Lemme know whatchu got to trade in either comment or PM.
---
I have Athene if your interested
---
Rolled on Pagle got the name I wanted as well :)
---
Koala
---
I feel your pain, friend.
---
Just curious, why is that?
---
So here's how I imagine what is raid finder now. You all Q up in the tool and one rando get to create the group together, manually with some sort of mega excel sheet lol. You now have this job to create raid finder group for the rest of classic.
---
War - Orc warrior (main)
---
Death - Undead priest 
---
Dread - not sure yet, maybe a warlock
---
On Arugal. Couldn't be more hyped for release.
---
Yes thank you! Blizz knows more than us ofc. P servers and other stuff can‘t be a comparison here because its something completely different. Just trust the devs a little bit. They don‘t want to destroy classic why should they. Its all about money and not about fighting with the community
---
I'm hoping you mean thex...fuvk asmond
---
Meanwhile I'm over here chilling on Myzrael seeing the chaos unfold.
---
You're god damn right he's god damn right about that other guy being god damn right
---
&gt;hundreds of kids onto a subreddit to spam for him and mass downvote people is right back to the awful personality though
---
But Asmongold and other streamer fanboys doing the same thing is ok?
---
Eventually fine yes, but there's a LOT of rose colored glasses over classic WoW.
---
ooh boo hoo u didnt get ur precious name? oh thats so bad I guess u need an imagination?
---
This. Way back when at the start of BC,  I joined a little server called The Forgotten Coast. It was recommended so it had a medium-to-low population. Turns out it was a bad idea in the long run and I've convinced myself I'm the only one on this server nowadays and if it weren't for phasing I'd be completely alone.
---
I was in que for 46 minutes. Everyone was in que
---
That’s where some of the big streamers are going, if that matters to you
---
Taxevasion just may be the best name of all time. OF ALL TIME.
---
Cheers
---
Layering makes the game playable.
---
Be the best you you can be, I believe in you.
---
Q'apla
---
I will, I have, and would do so again ;)
---
Jimbo on Herod
---
He meant curse words not coarse words.
---
I wish I could shapeshift into a koala );
---
Shooting my shot for Purple on Herod or Faerlina, DM me
---
I approve of drOOd.
---
The WPvP events may be a little bigger. Idk what else unless you want to play with or fight the streamers specifically though.
---
Laintime!
---
I'm not going to go find the clip for you but he's literally playing on Faerlina.
---
Zombie and Superhero
---
Fellow Barrens chat man! [https://i.imgur.com/6vDtgMH.png](https://i.imgur.com/6vDtgMH.png) got these. I hope that us being able to get these names so easily doesn't mean our server will be dead.
---
For sure rolling an alt ferda Glob Mob
---
&gt; (It will also replace all bones and meat assets with loaves of bread)
---
So what do Chinese huntards feed their raptors?
---
A guy who's going to give it to him for free.
---
I dunno, all I know is all the hype was for Herod and Faerlina.
---
I mean, if it is then that’s pretty cool. I have no idea how you had the time to choose the class for each lol. Maybe they just weren’t on top of the list for the majority.
---
Whoever got Mona on Herod... Hit me up. I'll give ya anything for it
---
NA LF, JAX, ORC, Tracker, Merchant
---
They make some exceptions for art, like Pixar's Coco got a wide release there and that movie is 80% skeletons
---
I’m only following the realm because of the possibility of events. We saw a glimpse of what’s possible with the dueling tournament.
---
You mistake the technological issues of 2004 for features in 2019. Blizzard aren't that stupid to make layering destroy the community feeling of the game. You and everyone else hellbent on layering is overreacting.
---
That's the notorious Sal Bundry. He's a Reddit... celebrity of sorts, I guess. You should feel humbled in his presence.
---
I think you're being trolled, man
---
Yeah, this isn't really enforced by GMs unless you have a booster retarded name, inefficient case... Good, you deserved it.
---
You can read up on classes and professions. A good site is [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live/). Retail is kind of a mess and might kill your hype.
---
If you have Ulfsark on Herod that was my paladins name for over a decade and id love to bond with you over Age of Mythology and hopefully get my name back
---
I got in like 5 minutes after launch. Was only number 30 in the queue. However, my husband kept getting kicked off the oceanic server, weird.
---
spam clicked at 5:57. Got into the exact server I clicked on, and was one of the first in. The "you can only make a character on this realm" thing popped up so I had a minute to randomize my chars appearance before locking in. Missed my first name choice. Got my 2nd for my main and the other two flawlessly.
---
I think I won the lottery.
---
Any chance someone here has the name "Stim" on Whitemane? LMK if willing to part with it. Been my tag for a long time, would be nice to have it on the server my friends would like to play on.
---
I got my 3 names on Whitemane U.S., Alliance. A few of my cousins and some friends and I are starting a raiding guild right away and plan on quickly developing. They have all been apart of top tier raiding guilds back in the day so we're all pumped for this!
---
That's a very pretty name, what does it mean? It sounds like a Latin or Greek origin
---
This is the all time winner. Nice. I cant think of a char to fit it though
---
Where can I see these polls
---
Shazzrah is a high pop server.
---
Which server were you trying to get it on?
---
Only good one I got was a mage pewpewkachu
---
I got Vincent as my undead rogue name! No more god damn ASCII i's and e's for me.
---
This is not true. He completely walked back his blacklisting comments once the backlash hit &amp; he realized how dickish it was.
---
However, videos &amp; posts about it on this sub were downvoted, so nobody knows that.
---
It's 2019, a time of cancel culture. People don't accept apologies anymore.
---
It is the streamer server.  It will have a bunch of people on it
---
I'm good, thanks tho
---
My friend wasn’t so lucky with the logging in part and couldn’t reserve his vanilla name. :(
---
Of course he was a bro and reserved mine, even tho it’s not that common. 
---
Any chance one of you guys is &lt;b&gt;Healbot&lt;/b&gt; and I can have it and return the kindness to him? I’d really appreciate it.
---
If anyone has the name Alpha on Fairbanks and Whitemane I will trade you 1 month of game time for it.
---
Mit dem Bild wäre die Verpflegung für die Launch Woche auch geklärt!
---
This is honestly releiving as I've been planning on maining hunter for months now. Ive spent a great deal of time or retro wow practicing in battlegrounds on my hunter and  I notice Lee way and spell batching all the time. Ive polymorphed players after they vanished on my mage and have seen people get snapped back to where they charged/blinked from if they get hit with a hard cc. I still find pvp on retro to be very skill intensive and engaging even if a little wonky. Drs will definitely suck in 1v1s for hunters but if some of the folks on this sub are correct the drs aren't that bad as I can confirm that you're lucky to get more than 10 to 15 seconds on your freezing trap. And in battle grounds you're lucky to even get that in a group fight not to mention youd be screwing yourself dumpimg all of your cc on one target in a battleground outside of counter attk/wing clip procs. So I am thankful for the diligence of this community and I will be rolling a hunter still, people dont like it then it just means I'll get my tier sets faster. 🤷‍♂️
---
Honestly, I’d damn near pay money to get my dragonlance names. I had connection issues spring up right when it dropped so I was 15 minutes behind. Raistlin was taken so I snagged Tanis, but unfortunately I had to resort to Raestlin :/ I was unnecessarily mad. I’m on Thalnos, myself. I am proud of Guldandy the Gnome Warlock, though.
---
It's the number of clients currently connected to the server
---
I love these! When is your Druid version coming out? :)
---
Nice! I got Diana for one of mine.
---
LF Phase, Scott, or Sp let me know if you have any information leading to these names!
---
Whoever got Healer on Whitemane, I’d be willing to send some $$$ or whatever else your way for the trade. PM me!
---
Loving the attitude for the server, hoping to avoid edgier parts of community with the RP'rs  
---
Old time player here, broke off after TBC cause enlistment and stuff.  Never played Alliance, here we go
---
Yea that is worrisome but I just dunno if they’re accurate or maybe I got lucky somehow. I was able to quit out and log back in multiple times with small queues or none at all.
---
Y'all wanted the vanilla experience and you got it, 100%. I had long ass queues on my server as well, the first months after release.
---
Also, Paladin "Pal" reporting in so I can't complain ;)
---
looking for "Quiver" on Whitemane or Herod
---
I was a Vanilla Resto Druid from 60 thru AQ. I always loved it.
---
Lf Boo on herod.
---
Have zoomy, picky, mote, and $.
---
Yeah I noticed when it autoed me to the wrong server, but I just said "fuck it" and ran with it. Friendship ended with Mankrik, now Atiesh is my friend.
---
He *did* walk it back.
---
People just don't know because videos &amp; posts of it were downvoted on this sub - because people want to "cancel" him.
---
I had reetard during the stress test
---
They really revamped it in mists, I remember logging in to play and seeing the “new and better” talent trees and then I immediately logged out and unsubscribed. Didn’t return until legion. We still have that shit talent layout to this day. They did a major pruning in cata which I understood because I imagine it got really difficult to balance classes when they had that many talents to take into consideration.
---
that didn't happen whatsoever
---
Dance in Ogrimar's AH

Just have fun!

Griz on Herod name ur price!!!
---
Man I was trying for Bm real hard. I ended up getting RL but that was a good get.
---
That face when Kill is already taken.
---
How can you possibly speculate this right now? Just by reading posts?
---
I lol'd so hard at this
---
/salute
---
Blizzard can't kill this game. You can choose to abandon your progress on it.
---
Is Fairbanks really slated to be a more mature server then Whitemane? I’d really hate to swim through a sea cringe every time I log on.
---
I did exactly this for a friend who is out of town today! HUGE upvote from me! XD
---
Got all three that I wanted:

I secured all 3 of my names 47 minutes after name reservation launch. I spent a long time trying to get on to the only Australian oceanic server with my mates
---
wtb goblin - herod
---
Very nice of you but to be fair the dude could have named his character mohawkx and not cried about it on the forums.
---
 \[Horde\]\[PVP\]\[EU\] Looking for guild of a good standard  that will raid at; Weekday afternoons or weekends (or both).
---
Hi Guys
---
Brit (28yo) currently living in Singapore for work and will be playing with my vanilla buds on EU servers. Thing is my raid times are probably going to be odd as we are GMT plus 7 or 8 hours - weekends should work well though. Have checked the connection on retail and seems there is no issue on that front.
---
Looking for fun active guild (Shazzrah most likely) with me. Have 5 to 10 of my buddies playing with that may or may not raid - we dont need to be in the same guild but can offer a good community. Please pop me a message or comment if keen to discuss further. I wont be the most hardcore in the world but I have raided top content in TBC/WOTLK/cat/mop/legion in the past so decent (enough) but have a life :D
---
Lots of love from the East xxx
---
You: I want to logg into Shazzrah
---
Blizz: You think you do, but you don't!
---
You're all real basic if this is an actual problem for you. This whole sub is constantly a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut off -_-
---
Just stay out of my rp server and we all good
---
Just 1 letter away from one of my names!  Small world eh?
---
Woodrow rocks, my man. Sorry about the other names though.
---
Lmao
---
Very interesting!
---
Browsing this subreddit over the weekend made me feel embarrassed to be a fan of this game. People need to chill lol.
---
Promise
---
OK
---
How come no other streamer knows? Not even sodapoppin a friend of his ? How come you're the only one who knows apparently ?
---
Sticky glue
---
That's so 30s 
---
/s
---
some say that you can hear the apes of strangle thorn vale chant his name right before the mating season starts.
---
The fact that the name is unavailable makes all of these reposts of the same joke unoriginal.
---
Some people like the newer games? 
---
I'm as keen as anyone for Classic but some people just enjoy the new games. That's how fans exist in the modern age.
---
Bethesda suck at making games, they have fans.
---
EA have fans that buy every new title even though they're clearly doing everything they can to squeeze every last penny from people.
---
Not that I disagree that Blizz is going downhill, I haven't played BFA for a while now and live just doesn't interest me at this stage but it still has players, people still like the game
---
What would you want for Flash?
---
What’s better for ranking. Mage or hunter
---
Looking forward to seeing you on Whitemane, Harambe.
---
Aww, personal attack, how toxic...
---
Sweet ;)
---
My rage is mild but my brother and I were both on doing the exact same thing on the same internet and...He got on whereas I was DC'd and in a perpetual state of loading. What is that? I'm very lucky though that my brother used one of his slots to reserve my name (Crone) on Herod.
---
I had no problem ever getting the name "FrostMage" on my priest on years old servers, yet it was gone even on low pop Fairbanks (pvp west). I logged in a few hrs after the realms opened, but still.
---
Would just like to add to this that Herod ALONE had a 7000+ que . . . Just for name reservation yeah some may be boxers trying to get that "Merlin" "Arthas" "Thex" glory but that's still a huge number Herod's projected number from a Reddit post only put it at 2.6k ( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp111a/census_and_server_demographic_results_subreddit/ ) and that was yesterday's numbers and just reddit alone. And I dont know how many people are allowed on each server at once but 7000 is still a massive number. 
---
It's been said forever by anyone who's been asked "what do you think will kill World Of Warcraft" 90% of the time the response is World Of Warcraft.
---
I hope classic lives and becomes a game of it's own I loved BC and I Loved Wrath but I dont want that again I want that alternate reality shit. I want a game that stays hard and requires effort where the quests add to the end game and u have to experience the damn world.
---
I apologize for the rambling rant.
---
Anyone have Nosferatu on Herod? We can work something out
---
There's also a time zone difference.
---
It will quiet down
---
13 days
---
I managed to grab a couple of great names on the RP server. But I was forcing the client to put me straight to server list, instead of dumping me into some other server first that I didn't want. It probably saved me a little time.
---
But my third character I tried to put on a normal server. My entire name list taken, even the uncommon ones. Something doesn't seem quite right.
---
I got fay, flicker and eden. Shitty behavior is shitty behavior.
---
I created random classes/races and chose the names. Waited a few hours then went ahead, deleted each one and chose the appearance/race/class that I wanted \^\^
---
Jesus I only knew of 7000 because if one of the guys in my discord but HOLY CRAP. We gotta make this survive guys.
---
no lmao, he deleted his account so i guess he REALLY didnt have it
---
Tfw i got Backstab, Sulfuras, and GL as character names
---
More the merrier
---
This has got to be the most ignorant stance when it comes to community feedback vs blindly trusting developers in gaming.
---
Blizzard decided to release one server (pve) in Korea. This was a good idea? People weren't supposed to complain about this horrible idea? People gave feedback and now they release another server being pvp.
---
The whole "it's their job, they have the data" argument is ridiculous. You should  have give critique or feedback if you think a company is doing something wrong.
---
Mooseknuckle, albeit hilarious, will sadly not make it in todays game
---
0/3 of the people I talk to regularly. None of my b.net friends were online for name reservations, AFAIK. I was so hype but my friends on teamspeak didn't care that much, even though they'll be playing Classic. Filthy casuals.
---
Where did u got that info ? tribes stream titele still says gollemagg but i think its a bait and they will roll shazzrah.
---
Same for me. I went with a roleplay server.
---
Dude same. I made sure everything was good to go and was waiting by 5:45. Started logging in 5 minutes earlier just in case servers went up a bit early, but nope... regular time and was stuck on logging into game server. So annoyed... I feel your pain
---
If anyone has the name Alien on herold, I'd love to trade for it
---
Got my hunter, Goodwill. That's all I wanted.
---
Also got myself and a friend Riggs and Murtaugh for our twinks.
---
What do you say? try /gquit
---
Ganking. Streamers?
---
We can use a shovel animation
---
No need to be jealous
---
I had the server window popped for 30 minutes before it went active. I clicked as soon as it became available. Of course, going Herod PvP, there was a ton of congestion. 
---
I was loading and had no queue (literally I’m quite roughly very near the front of the list), and the server opened the character creation window and disconnected me two seconds later as I clicked create. 
---
I had to reenter my login info and after a new strenuous wait of roughly 1 min, I was launched into 7780th of the queue.
---
I feel deeply cheated as that initial disconnect may well have cost me Legolas 🧝‍♂️
---
No we don't.
---
My point is you are literally brain dead if you think having to wait 5 minutes in a very specific situation isn't worth it when compared to what would happen if you could just hop instantly. But not looking at the big picture is a trait associated with children. Its okay though in the future you will learn that sometimes mommy can't make everything perfect.
---
2 of my reservations on herod 1 on faeirlina
---
I managed to get on at like 3:02 and Betty was already taken on fairbanks. If you’re willing to part with it let me know
---
Oh EU, that explains a lot. They didn’t have to compete against the most popular WoW streamers and thousands upon thousands of their fans on the “streamer server” or the “meme” server. Thanks for making my case lol.
---
Take an upvote.
---
Can we get an Alex was right in chat?
---
20,000?
---
I doubt they will be rolling out new servers before launch. After launch they will just open them.
---
Have my upvote
---
Instant - EU, 20 minutes ago :) got names i wanted
---
Looking for "Vale" on Faerlina
---
Stick with those who you had fun with originally. If you're horde, maybe you and your buddies can join me and mine in our guild. Gonna be some casuals but a good amount of grinders too.
---
I didn't know about the "wrong server" thing until I saw this thread; I checked, and now I'm sad. My names were reserved on the wrong server and - of course - are no longer available on the server I want to play on. Fifteen years with the same name and class ends when Classic comes out in a fortnight. I'm gutted. I took my computer to work just so I could get the name I wanted :(
---
My main will be a female dwarf paladin and nobody can tell me otherwise. They are awesome
---
Who is Alex? Lol

yeah okay. I've seen it happen on at least 5 pserver launches now. This won't be different. Attrition is a thing, don't kid yourself
---
Yeah thank god we have TWO whole servers to choose from... yay...
---
Mods announced that anything but Rule #2 goes for the next week, so that's a no.
---
I’d love to but we really have our hearts set on pvp. World pvp is our main thing we want to do.

Mooseknuckle eewwww

I’ll be seeing you cucks on the other side of the battlefield. Lok’tar Ogar!

Some of us in our 40's enjoy immature names that involve boobs and poop too!

IVE BEEN THE ONLY ONE USING MY NAME SINCE FER FEEKIN EVER, NEVER HAD ANYONE TAKE IT IN ALL MY TIME PLAYING ON \*REDACTED\* SERVERS, BUT THEN I WAIT A GOD DANM HOUR AFTER I GET OFF WORK TO RES MY NAME AND SOMEONE TOOK IT ON HEROID. FUCK THAT IM ROLLING WITH MAMI WHITEMANE.
---
Death to all players with an altcode in their character name!
---
Just going to throw it out there that I would be interested in one last survey with people indicating which server they're on, which faction and which class. This may help to give those still deciding or those worried about faction/class imbalance an opportunity to change their mind.
---
STREAMERS!!!! ZZ You guys are more than welcomed to play on Herod!!!! Join me and my friends if you wanna it would be great to have you guys roaming around herod If you want!! Ignore the clowns who make multiple accounts to try and fend you guys off!!! PEOPLE LOVE YOU GUYS!!! IGNORE THE BIGOTS! :)
---
Horde indeed!
---
I tried to do Shrimpking and it wouldnt let me due to adult language...
---
“Celebrity” lmaooooo
---
This.
---
Herod Horde for my 12
---
I went to the Cleveland Indians game, missing the first 4 hours of name reservation. Still managed to snag:
---
Shockcity- orc shaman
---
Necrophage- undead warlock
---
Brokentusk- troll rogue.
---
Overall pretty damn happy! See you all soon.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
You said that you shouldn't exist outside of level 1-5 areas, and that is so defeatist. :( I am encouraging you.
---
its rp-pvp
---
Name reservation aka final stress test.
---
Somebody took Manbearpig away from me!!!! Nooooooo
---
Wax, on whitemane. I'll pay :)
---
&gt;I got Missbanana, a porn star on pornhub.
---
Well now i need to know what I'm dealing with. For science.
---
Ah gotcha. Might do that sometime too. I dunno why I was gonna wait until release to do that.
---
90% by 25 is just wrong, nost grew over time, plus this isnt a p server so ur only argument is also wrong
---
Shouldn't you have the ponytail?
---
10,000 on Herod but I kept exiting and logging back in, got in after my 3rd attempt, so maybe 90 second wait? Imagine if I just sat there and waited lol
---
Both Thex and Asmon got people reserving their name. Thex is in a Discord im in and just watch Asmons stream from earlyer.
---
I didn't have a queue officially, just several minutes of "logging in to game server"
---
Looking for the name **Irulan** on **shazzrah**. I've used that name since day one of vanilla and I'm really attached to it. PM me and we can work something out.
---
Subaru tells grandma she loves Emilias nudes.
---
Just play.
---
this is quality
---
That’s where I was introduced to him as well
---
Just 20 😅
---
I've been personally wondering this as well. It seems sorta popular also because of the name being an anagram for horde. Best case scenario is once a bunch of people leave it to just try out vanilla, will quit early on.  Was thinking about going to Whitemane instead however It's PST, Would rather be on EST, and being on Faerlina doesn't interest me. I'd rather go to Pagle at that rate as I will be rolling Alliance.
---
Realm: Faerlina
---
Want: 
---
Any 2-5 char names. 
---
Harrypotter
---
Harry
---
Abracadaver
---
Send me a DM and we can work something out.
---
Just like my parents.
---
I had the same thought:  [https://imgur.com/a/YfTN9vf](https://imgur.com/a/YfTN9vf)
---
Just do the quests man end game isn’t the only content in classic. Unlike current wow you don’t have to race. It’s going to be a lot of fun on the journey too.
---
Going to live it up as long as I can!
---
The true APE NA players are rolling EU. 100%
---
I mean the only way to get a true classic experience is to play on Herod and sit through queues and loading screen bosses
---
Jokes on your buddy. No server called faeralina exists
---
I got 3 stormlight archive names on shazz
---
WTB Jon on whitemane, DM me
---
Aww man, I was so mad to discover that was taken earlier. 
---
Had to go with my second choice.
---
Oh lol because I heard the queue got to over 20,000 on Shazzrah lol? Some people got past that
---
3/5 and we reserved the names for the other 2.
---
Ah I didn't know I needed to reserve names. I always just hit auto generate like 17 times.
---
I have spearmint on thalnos looking to trade maybe :)
---
Your names reveal a level of sophistication that is too good for the 4chan designated realm. Good luck over there!
---
I think playing with og friends is half the fun of classic. At least for me.
---
Holy wall of text Batman 
---
Edit that and make paragraphs bro , too long didn’t read
---
Just because you don't value your money doesn't mean no-one does.
---
At least they were able to try.  I couldn't even update my payment options today.
---
Ahmpy has his 35h /played 1-40 vod still up (done in a single sitting).
---
Actually I was surprised when I saw this myself. I was doing dispell poison quest for druid where you have to collect water from top of that mountain.
---
You guys are more than welcomed to play on herod!  The mass hate comes from one guy with multiple accounts!! Play wherever you want!! If you're getting stressed over something that isnt even out yet.  You should be rethinking and straightening out YOUR priorities and problems in life.  Herod doesnt mind if streamers show up! WE WELCOME YOU TO ROAM WITH US!!!!
---
Probably 10% or less, hard to tell before the game settles in after launch
---
WHO THE FUCK GOT SHAGGER OR OXY ON SHAZZRAH-EU?!
---
ROFL!!!!! Gotta admit this made me laugh out loud.  Nice consistent filtering there, Blizz!
---
Looking for Scott on Herod, will paypal.
---
They'd have to go with completly different names on the other server if they did that, unless they got some other trusted people to reserve their names on other servers. Asmon streamed himself trying to get his name so we know he doesn't have it on another server and Esfand and a few others were able to get their names on Faerlina.
---
Their names are more important than anything and right now, like I said unless they have trusted people that were able to get their names on another server, they won't switch.
---
So my first character created back in OG classic was based on a Tolkien name, but I took that “not copyrighted or from another work” super seriously at the time lol so it’s not a direct one. Went with a modified version of Beregond, who is a favorite minor character due to his loyalty to Faramir (a favorite major character), and came up with Berethos.
---
Been using that name and modified versions of it ever since.
---
OMFG my first silver ! Thank you so much kind stranger !

&gt;always drink when you get the chance, even if you only get to drink for 5-10 seconds (assuming you don't run out of water).
---
Can be a good way to use up outdated water when you just need a little topoff.
---
Be civil and respectful.
---
So all the name posts will be allowed for the next week.
---
I really really wanted Cattlerage but had to settle for Mewmewkitten
---
I had a guild on The forgotten Coast in BC blood brotherz ! Classic haha
---
No one ever takes the name I give my character anyway, got it on 3 different servers
---
I expect it to quiet down, but not in the first week. The server is high pop already and that only includes people who have active subs 2 weeks before launch. It's definitely a valid concern if you want to avoid queues and potential issues the first week, but it may not be a major concern down the line.
---
nah you're just a narc, don't blame your age.
---
Spanish speakers are welcome at the diverse server of golemagg!
---
Credit to my buddy who came up with it!
---
I hope that’s the chosen realm! I saw guy did coin flip after all...
---
I never said you did. You are saying that the delay is bad because you might leave a group you really meant to stay in (which only applies to the open world not dungeons where you actually need to be grouped up) and that having a few minute inconvenience to be able to rejoin their layer is stupid. Then I said that the delay was put in to solve a significantly worse problem and that the minor inconvenience is better than having the economy get fucked. But sure im the one who can't keep up. Please don't bring your stupidity to Whitemane. Why don't you just go back to playing on your private servers cause mommy wont pay $15 a month. Then you wont have to worry about have minor inconveniences in a game that takes months of investment to get to endgame. Lol
---
7pm VS 10pm raids/premades is a pretty significant difference. Peak times will be off as well. I work a 9-5 now, playing in another time zone plus purposely increasing latency doesn't make any sense for me.
---
I got my own name on two severs and then was able to get my fifth favourite alt name. My four favourites were taken =(. The pains of using names from a popular book series. Thank goodness Amalisa is an obscure character that only shows up once for two pages lol!
---
Bliz will try to accurately re-create classic wow mechanics to the best of their ability. No balance patches, etc. If that answers your question.
---
No changes.
---
&gt; significant hit in raids? Which of the races do you think has the biggest impact on their play style (Trolls pve and undead pvp)? 
---
None of em. you will kill every single boss eventually either as Troll or Undead, but what is more important for me personally is how they look, move, cast and Undeads are #1. DPS loss to a Troll? pff yeah take that fracture of my DPS and keep looking at your ugly legs thinking about our Will of the Forsaken and how you messed up the creation day.
---
I made my name selection on the 3 servers I wanted to play on including Herod. Going to leave all 3 until I see which server seems the best after the first 2 weeks.
---
Hahahaha
---
I am willing to bet that Herod will have quite the queue time. It was rated as high pop well into 6:30pm PST. I think followed by Whitemane. On the plus side, I think that over time it will stabilize and layering (working appropriately) will alleviate much of the crowding.
---
Outside of some world mobs, I don't think you will have to worry too much. Pretty sure battlegrounds will swing horde in the end.
---
Is it worth switching names? Idk, how attached to your names are you? You could try to remove your least favorite of the 3 (or 4, 5 if you were unlucky in this regard) and see if your name of choosing is available on another server. I personally think you will be fine.
---
Reason being, when the servers launch people who didn't want to pay $15 for early names and no game time will join, as well as people who want to wait out the launch storm. They will fill up the other servers and it's entirely likely we will all be in the same boat.
---
That's my .02.
---
Bring it. But beware, amongst my shadows may roam those that surprise others..be warned.
---
Pretty sure they implemented the later WF change so it can't crit off of itself and no reck-bombing paladins. Other than that, I have no idea.
---

You can communicate.. a lot of us do speak English, and those who don't do it all that well at least understand a bit and try to talk the best way they can..

Nice! Can’t wait to see you in Durotar my friend! I assume with a name like that you’ll be RPing?
---
I gotchufam, just chill.

Well I thought I got my names on my server, and the queue was 9800 so I’m praying it was the right server!!

---
I was playing the stress test the other day and Mudvayne randomly came on Spotify. I was like hoooooly nostalgia
---
My alarm didn't go off...
---
At this point the server is just a name. It's the same as any other PVP server. With the amount of servers any PVP one will be just as poppin.
---
News to me. [Here's Scholo with so. much. bread.](https://imgur.com/8RzblVm)
---
I know it's a long shot but if anyone has Psycho on Glom the Us RPPvP server, message me. I'd love to make a deal.
---
It’s also a pacific realm if that matters to you.
---
I really would like Volt on Faerlina.
---
I got Volt on Thalnos and Bloodsail Buccaneers and I'd love to trade for Faerlina Volt, if you're out there, alternate-volt. :sob:
---
&gt;In short, everyone is freaking out for no reason, wait for launch, if everything is fucked after launch then complain. 
---
This is pretty much an exact copy of what everyone said when BFA was in beta, I realize I'm super late to the game here, but damn, it's just hilarious seeing this.
---
Grog Mob Babey!!!!
---
Yeah I get that they want there names but, there is always that chance they do get someone to hold the name for them. I watched the stream there already talking to people in twitter dm’s and stuff like that they could pay people for the name or simpler get it for free because a nice fan got it. We shall see lol
---
I'm rolling Alliance and looking to do 49 twinks ASAP. Farming gold and helping people level before phase 2
---
Alternatively, a lot of people from my guild are playing classic
---
It’s like a shitty tattoo
---
Shit. that's been my character name in most games since i can remember. I was stuck in the login limbo and missed out.
---
We also knew the pressure on just two EU pvp servers would be huge and we were right. Both had 12k+ queues and it will be 30k at launch.
---
Since then they made blood elves to lure young players into the horde kek.
---
Ahshit Stinkfist is taken, that was gonna be my Undead Rogue. :(
---
Ok?
---
Tried getting the name Dad. Was already taken sadly.
---
Read your comments. Then read mine. Who's shitting on who my guy.
---
what do u mean coil breaks wotf. how is wotf not that big of a deal
---
Again with the novels man, you're really sucking daddy blizzards dick there bud, getting real defensive all because I point out the fact that layering is in a fucked state right now.
---
Go wipe your lil poopy bum bum stinker boi and get a new change of pampers xD
---
and like.. if you were missing out on some crazy shit people would be in /1 or something and you can get an invite to the layer. I mean its so easy to abuse right?
---
Imagine your name is Jack. Everyone knows that you are Jack, your friends, your family. Then you got new job and you find out at same time another Jack starts working there. So rest just decide to call you Jimmy instead.
---
Feel very similar. My rule is - if you like a YouTuber, never watch them stream. The unfiltered view of content creators only leads to realising theyre either assholes, manchildren or something else is fucked up.
---
Alex was prime example back in the day - great YouTube content but malicious streamer.
---
Pretty happy with my bank alt too

nost times were best times in my wow-life (was too young to play vanilla-2004). so thank you. thanks a lot. i was very very sad (can't find right words) when they closed it, in a year - was excited about classic.. but now i see something that looks like shitty changes and not sure classic will be same great (same as nost, same as wow). probably my wow-journey of 9 years ends in few month. 
---
p.s. playing on nost really changed my life: i saw bik difference between countries, ppl, societies - and changed country (was living in ru-speaking one). and now my life is much better than before, couldn't even imagine such bik difference or think it's that ez, so ty for it too :)

Wanted Grim. Got Grym.

The best darn soft drinks known to man. They tasted SO good. I really can't believe they didn't end up keeping these around as standard flavors eventually.

And I've heard that they did bring back the citrus cherry one, but I've looked all over and can't find it. Not even on the internet.

I can't believe that this got plat, gold x2 and silver x4.
---
Bold of you to assume that any of us get sleep.
---
Ah I misread your comment. People will be out of naming posts in a day anyway
---
Apparently the most prominent Spanish streamer is on golemagg, don't really know what that entails though.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Unnaccessable but at a certain point in development one of the islands was known as [Gilijim's Isle](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gillijim%27s_Isle) but wasn't fleshed out. You can probably youtube the islands name to see bits of it.
---
They were always there, we just couldn't get to them due to the Maelstrom's force. Lore stated that naga and shipwrecked sailors lived there. Eventually, after the invasion of the Dark Portal and subsequent reckoning of the demons the Maelstrom's power waned allowing us to find Northrend. After Northrend was dealt with, Deathwing emerged from the Maelstrom and began destroying the world.
---
you guys think the name "Gunt" will get me flagged for a name change?
---
Survival is your bis raiding and dungeon spec once you re geared enough
---
&gt;ALL Goblins in the Goblin Foundry should summon mechanical golems
---
Stunning them at the start of combat (copper bombs) or sheeping them, prevents them from summoning on my server. First dungeon that gnomish universal remote can be useful in, to mind control a mechanical golem.
---
right there with ya bud, didn't get my name :/ puts a big ol' damper on my hype, but i'll just have to live with it.
---
Typical pejorative.
---
For the first 6 phases everything will be unchanged. After naxx, who knows.
---
Thank goodness they’re the ones trying to claim “official” status of the discords they set up for each server.
---
that's what did it for you?
---
Obviously you use Boomkin as your main. Followed by Oomkin as your troll. Followed by TJ as your street dealing merchant.
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE....
---
I prefer Deathguy tyvm
---
Also a hunter skill otherwise known as "misdirect".
---
Hahaha I love it. That response is why I chose the name. You'll have to find me and gank my holy priest ass while leveling cause I'm going to be raiding otherwise when I get to 60 and will always be guarded.
---
Wut?
---
Surely that's Rogue or Mage
---
U did good
---
It kind of is a stress of their db. Making a new likely large db entity per character is a fair bit of stress.
---
I’d rather see the clip of him sperging because he didn’t get his name
---
That sounds like bollocks. Survival starts beating MM around 450 agi.
---
I wasn’t able to get subbed in time to save my name on Herod. RIP Haokah! I hope whoever got the name actually uses it.
---
Also it won’t work at all because of layering lol
---
Can't stand his streams but he does good guides, helped me get the darkmoon races achievements. When he isn't playing up to viewers on twitch he's ok
---
I now am a dwarf warrior named Flimsy. I'm feeling like I won the race :D
---
Because it’s fake no arrows to swap char positions
---
And I wonder if the people who name reserved today are really the people likely to drop off before phase 2. So Herod could still be a beast when layering is removed. 
---
I'm happy on my mid pop. It'll gain sightseers for sure on release, but likely back into mid pop eventually. And it appears to be very lopsided towards my faction, so still plenty of raid guild options in that mid pop.
---
The smaller one in the southwest is either Tel Abim or Kezan, the larger one in the south is Zandalar, and the group in the north are the Broken Isles.
---
Y’all can’t fool me! You’re scared of RichTurpin!
---
Really happy for yall! Glad y'all got what y'all wanted! I thought it was crazy they didn't give y'all a pvp server to start!
---
Hahah. Yee
---
Dude's not keen on losing his names but at the same time wants attention so can't resist posting.
---
I was daboo in the stress test lol
---
I tried just Rogue, mage, warrior etc all were unavailable on fairbanks :( rouge mebbe though
---
Lol I wish you luck!
---
I had a friend with the name "Ieatass" and it lasted years.
---
I rate these at roughly "16 year old boy"

---
I have faith in Classic team, but they can only do so much with what they are given, and what they are given depends on the inept leadership at Acivision.
---
You want to see something REALLY depressing ? Connect to the official servers, my server had 18 people connected last night.
---
See you on Arugal, mate
---
Side note: how fun would it be to have a faction war that was heavily Aus/NZ split ie: all Australians played alliance and Horde were kiwis, imagine the banter!
---
I can promise you if someone was named Yolo or swag in my group, I would not take them seriously. This is hurting yourself breh
---
I believe BGs will be cross server. So that should be no concern.
---
If they went and pulled a switch, that’s just going to piss people off. They’re not really in a position to be on the bad side of half their servers. If their goal is to play the game, pissing off everyone around them is only going to have them getting stream sniped and ganked/camped regularly.
---
Clever. Not triggered, and it was an honest mistake looking at a thumbnail on a cell phone. Still, why do you think forming an opinion about someone's character based on hypothetical support of Trump is being triggered? Clearly the man has no decency and is intentionally dividing the US further by empowering the worst of us.

I started naming my characters after household objects as a meme but then i leveled a priest to 110 named Furniture. Even played Furniture on the stress test for classic. Sadly, i was not quick enough on the name reservations because of a night class. Upside is i still reserved Cardboardbox, so I’m not entirely heart broken!
---
Negative, not on pagel

Rofl, it's the total opposite. He's capitalizing on creating drama as a d-bad and you can't see that? He was soo calm and passionate in his old videos. So sad he took this route.

That's the issue though: no one wants to be stuck with a bunch of immature stream loving children screaming in general chat. We're in our thirties.. we want some peace and quiet, and just wow
---
You're apparently one of the only people that doesn't know by now.  Just accept it, damn guy.
---
It’s the Private Server community. So, for EST take your pick between Streamer+Spanish-speaking community, Private Server community, or Brazilian community.
---
My biggest concern about Herod is faction imbalance. It could end up being something like US-Illidan that’s very Horde heavy and ends up being a de facto PvE server because no allies want to play there.
---
Dorf or Nelf
---
I want my main char to be a secret?
---
Oh man! That's awesome.
---
Asmon won't quit classic
---
Mine was in the dropdown. Try deinstalliert the blizzard launcher
---
Shazzrah had a 6k+ queue at one point last night, and name reservation started at midnight EU time.
---
I doubt turbo casuals are staying up a couple hours past going to bed, to reserve their name, and then feel like shit at work today from not sleeping well.
---
I went to bed early and woke up to reserve my name, and then went back to bed. This sucks, a lot.
---
The arrows are only shown when you target your char mate.
---
Restart PC or make sure battle.net is updated
---
Im on golemagggggg
---
So much for that garbage excuse people used as an argument against a toggle for the new models. "I want everyone to see my character exactly the way I created it!!!"
---
How exactly do you “reserve” a name? Are you purchasing an account and the other person takes it over?
---
Warlock probably, free lvl 40 mount cheaper (a little) lvl 60 mount. Doesn’t super rely on food/drink.
---
Play the class you will enjoy the most. Don't worry about leveling as efficiently as possible. You'll regret it if you don't.
---
Warlock and pallies get free mounts at 40
---
Whatever it takes.
---
Someone's getting corpse camped.

Hahah keep replying lil stinker boy gotta go change that diaper soon™ xD maybe mommy has some wipey wipeys for you so ur lil stinky bum bum doesnt get too sore

PM me what your looking to get for it I wouldn’t mind this name
---
On all realms my precious gold farmer name ‘Whale’ has been taken :(
---
Logged in at 3:01. Servers said “Locked”. Selected the server I wanted anyway. Got in quickly and got my names. Even customized my toons, which only takes a few extra seconds anyway.
---
However, had those names been taken, I’d still be fine. I understand people being bummed, but people talking about unsubbing because of a name is pretty silly.
---
I agree but, they don’t seemed worried about it enough lol
---
tried that, nothing :(
---
Looking for Maverick on Fairbanks or Herod. Extreme longshot.
---
I have Cougar on Herod if that interests someone.
---
Yes I'm a sucker Top Gun.
---
Can someone please explain what has happened today, never played WOW but I found you on popular
---
I can understand not wanting to an on a streamer server and coming to a mutual agreement to respect each other's wishes and stay on certain servers for certain experiences. Makes sense.
---
What I don't get is the whole "if you see any streamer on Herod, kill them over and over again until they leave".
---
I loved this subreddit when I first joined, and I got excited at the possibility that WoW could get its community aspect back. What sort of community encourages bullying and harassing people until they leave? I get some people say "well XYZ streamer did XYZ bad thing". That doesn't justify it, at least not taking it out on every single streamer. It makes me want to avoid Herod if that's the kind of thing that's acceptable.
---
Great
---
The unofficial servers have people join ally and horde
---
maybe you can still get psilocyn
---
The top character is selected
---
I’ve always found that most people recommend two handed fury build, although classic doesn’t have hamstring kiting I believe so that’s a pretty massive changes for warrior levelling.
---
If you’re rolling on a pvp realm however, arms is the preferred spec as it’s the only way you’re semi viable at world pvp whilst levelling.
---
People say it’s horrendous but I’ve always found it super fun. 
---
Just roll one and give it a go, it’s the best way to learn :)
---
2000 responses seems quite low.  Especially if it was just posted on reddit which is mainly an English website.

Do people talk normally there or is everyone on RP mode? I would be looking to avoid taking part of the RP myself but I wouldn’t mind observing it and being around friendly people. The thought of walking in to a tavern and seeing players drinking and talking makes the world itself seem more authentic and alive
---

They're the rarest because there's less of them

Gz! Did this happen before or after name reservation started?
---
Leveling a Nelf with my rogue Nelf buddy

Congrats! Funny how people actually believed they wouldnt add a pvp server. It would have been a big mistake.
---
Big if true. Intentionally avoided “WHITEMANe” knowing the type that would go for that...
---
That's like a phone payment.
---
trash
---
• I've never used a coldsnap ice block macro cause coldsnap isnt on global there's really no need.
---
• The cancelaura is for getting out of iceblock its just a normal frostbolt if not, it doesnt matter if frostbolt is first in the macro.
---
• I've gotten focus macros to work on private servers but they don't work currently on classic, if i get an addon to get them working in the future i will update the video.
---
• You don't need a rank1 frostbolt macro its in your spellbook.
---
grobuluus will have all the world pvp guilds from emerald dream there man lol
---
LF Angel related names (Angel, Angela, Angelic etc) and then Sadist, Sadistic or Sadism on Herod. Probably won’t work but figured I’d try. 💕

Yes there are meaningful decisons but you don't need to decide them. It's so homogenized that there is a best way for everything. That's the nice part of vanilla.
---
Combat Swords spec damage will vastly outdo sub spec until late AQ40 when you are able to get enough crit on gear to make your backstabs/ambushes start critting reliably.  I would use “Oto’s rogue guide” from google to level as combat swords and raid combat swords until late AQ40 where a sub build will become more optimal

Would be hilarious if streamers are just pranking and suddenly play on Herod when its release. Reddit would explode.

You betcha!

I kinda wanted to reserve Chad instead of my own made up names since there's little chance they'd get taken, but it was taken by the time I got on and I got on pretty early too :(

I agree that it's probably stupid. But I did it anyways. I have a well paying job, and I never do shit for myself. All my spending is on stuff my wife likes (which is fine...if she's happy, I'm happy). But fuck it, I'm allowed to burn some money too for something meaningless yet somehow exciting.

---
Well, if you go to from launchers right corner, under your name to account settings. It will say there what kind of access does the account have. Every payed account has expansions until Legion. Starter accounts (without gametime) just says Starter edition. If you add gametime to them, it says legion.
---
That's an awful tip. People should learn to toggle it off and on naturally, otherwise every time they're in a group but still need their growl it'll just automatically turn off.

Warriors are gear-reliant. Also if you're the only warrior in a group/raid, you're the tank 9/10. Fury/arms will be low until MC gets cleared, then they start moving up the charts a bit. Once AQ/BWL loot pinatas start to pop, they go to #1. I would not recommend arms spec outside of pvp (leveled arms elsewhere, it's.. slow. Hits hard but way too slow.)
---
Thanks! Planning on feral tank :)

That server is gonna be so dead when most of the streamers move on to other games. People like Lirik etc are gonna play 1 or 2 weeks and Asmon and Co. can't sustain the population of the whole server.

Reading this thread made me realise how lucky I was. I got in instantly. Chose Bloodsail, and got all three of my names, most importantly, Muse.

These posts lame
---
Is there a problem with that?

I should hope it does

Nah i manage to get 5 characters aswell. Just spammed klicked create on stuff and they never got created, so i logged out/in and did it again with other names as i thought first ones was taken.

Why? A character name that is a 90s film? With Leonardo DiCaprio? A toon that is literally going to sink a raid? I don't get it.

It's not a videogame to many of us anymore.  A major part of the appeal is for moments like this, to feel a wave of emotions we haven't felt in WoW or maybe any game in a long time.

They're fine until you fry the on-board graphics. The specs to run classic are on the forums, as I'm at work I can't link it.
---
Whatever the percentage, it's too much.
---
There could be a lot of people who will show up on launch day or soon after that didn't care to reserve a name today. They might log in, see Herod as high pop, and start filling in the others. Then the others might end up as high pop too.
---
And/or people will leave Herod early for the other servers because they don't want the queues.
---
Well just have to see how it all pans out when the game is actually playable
---
Every one of us in our 50's love all sorts of shit related to feces, sex and the like. Guhhhh---

Well, i think you can setup it so that it wakes up when you need it. If you have it on like hibernate state, it wont even use electricity at all. I just leave it on tbh, gotta share them linux torrents (and i want to access certain things remotely anyways).
---
Used the same system playing wow for many years now, if there were long queues. Its super easy to setup.
---
WTB Bob or Bahb on Herod 
---
Bob is preferred
---
The one thing I'm worried about is how many concurrent players a server can handle at once when layering is gone.  What happens if the player numbers don't go down as much as they thought then they try to cram a ton of people onto the server without layering.  Hope they are ready for that.

Anyone have the link to the Fairbanks subreddit?

If Rox on Shazzrah reads this, my wife would love to get that name.

Syrup on Shazzrah EU, didn't think I'd lose that.

Yes, this point is misinformed, ASCII characters are legal.

Me and about 10-15 lads, all 26+ (minus 2 younger folks of our group) are rolling Fairbanks.

I am glad we RNG'd choosing this server and it's seeming to turn out to be the 25+ age server of dudes who work a lot.

In the terrible mmo, Wildstar, I was banned for naming my character Bigtitssmallguns.  It was literally describing the character I was playing, gunslinger dual pistol wielding chick with big tits.  Some feminist mod must've been triggered.

Paying for Devil on Herod

Got in so fast in the beginning i thought i might get Axl. But got dc before creating. Logging in again relativly fast but then it was taken... rip
---
Nah bruh, you don't have to pay Blizzard to have common sense
---
Melkor is reserved by Blizzard, noone can get it so don't feel bad friend!
---
I want to run into a Stormwind full of breadheads.
---
because its classic not like current expantions while there is a servers merge. your server will be like your only world, you will never contact or play with other servers like now in bfa for example.
---
Ghosts are OK in china, just no bones.
---
I saw a queue of 10000 just for name reservation at one point. Not everyone who's going to play Herod has even made their character yet. I wouldn't doubt 75,000+ people expecting to play Herod. What the hell do you think their hard cap is? I'm worried.
---
Legolas on Faerlina
---
"Hate" On Herod PM ME for GOLD IRL

LF Ew on Herod
---
You got all that from 2 minutes of watching? Devoid of context? Seems fair.
---
You can still change the T to a D since its the big tiddy goth gf.

Could someone add googly/blinking cartoon eyes to this plz.

Where? When?
---
It was the only server that was over populated with queues on the *name* reservation launch
---
Asmongold

I'm part of a coalition of guilds, we all got together on discord and coordinated our characters. Between the alliance and horde side we number 1900+. The server showed "High" for several hours, then dropped to low. None of us changed servers, I think Blizzard just changed the threshold or something. Rest assured, there are 1900 on the server in this discord alone - add other guilds that are not there or unaware plus, I'm sure, plenty of randoms and you've got a very healthy population.
---
I'm even told Skarm has registered here.
---
Irvine resident here, I can hear them cackling as I lay in bed right now :(
---
Ah ops
---
Super kind of you! I’m alliance on Whitemane! I’ll hyu for some of that pvp action - I got your name 😉
---
Even just watching him run around in the world is painful to me - he's holding W (not using NumLock) and even keyboard turning! Makes his hands too busy to be a normal human and say hi to his new party member.
---
It's a fucking joke just like this subreddit.
---
How is he being a manchild you dumbass, he said in his stream that it depends on where his friends go and his friends have finally chosen the server. asmon said on his stream that is where he will go ONCE his friends decide where. He was waiting on them to make a decision
---
I would pay r/l money for this...
---
This is the kind of guild I'm looking for. Will hit you all up tomorrow. I played vanilla and cleared every single boss, server first/Horde First BWL/AQ/Naxx content, KT &amp; C'Thun on farm on Burning Blade. Played a Holy Priest full T3+Benny. Hit Rank 11 in PvP.
---
My friends and I are playing Fairbanks alliance. If you’re alliance and wanna be friends pm me
---
Shit
---
Any Simpsons names on Arugal are going to be worth hundreds of AUD
---
i wanted to save a name dude, friend says it's gone now. Fucking awesome, why did I even bother in the first place.
---
Please god make it good, I only picked it because they named it after my waifu senpai
---
Theres no ban on stuff like that in China. Video games definitely have skeletons and shit there. But a lot of western companies self-censor before they pass it through the bureau so they can guarantee it'll pass. You dont want the chinese market coming to your game weeks late
---
These are fun. Looking forward to warlock.

Amaranthine on Pyrewood Village? Please, pleeeeeaseeee...

---
Any chance this may still become a thing?
---
Is everyone in that chat five years old or were they all somehow kicked in the head by horses?
---
Thanks was wondering the same.
---
Blizzard might know more than me, but everything points that 2 PVP EU English servers was a fucking retarded idea. When 2 hours AFTER the name reservation had started ( 2-3AM in europe ) one of the PVP servers still had 10k queue just to create chars, you know they fucked up.
---
They BIGLY overestimated the population going to german/french/russian servers. Not everyone german player wants to play on a german server etc. And that meant they were WAYY off on english PVP servers. You would have needed 4 PVP EU English servers. 3 would have been a big improvement. Now they will have to CLOSE/LOCK the new account char creation to Shazz, 110% sure. Its beyond capped atm. Golemagg might be near capacity too. So GL if you didnt reserve names prior launch... its the new few servers they are going to add for you. And those are the ones that die/get merged first.
---
Or we are going to have 20k+ population servers and thats not really vanilla like. And it means their "layers" need to hold a fuck ton more people than previously stated.
---
Whitemane is just such a better sounding name and cooler character.
---
Ivy on any EST pvp server
---
Blizzard have done amazing things to, and if you were to bullet point them all out, it would be a lot longer than this papabless list above.

no

im looking for kaiju on herod, i have kaijoo if you want.
---
Get off your knees/ get off your alt account alex.
---
don't even get the option on my browser to download fucking classic, great day for me.
---
What if blizzard is ok with this because it's expected
---
Looks like Shane from the walking dead.
---
Anyone have tacos on herod / whitemane?
---
Yes. There is also a mod to do it called  advanced options or something like that. It is on willitclassic.com.
---
Fairbanks won't be dead.  A lot of alliance got scared off by the fact that there's so many horde on it  (projected) though.  
---
100% won't be dead.
---
Gotta Pom the last frostbolt right as arcane power is running out.
---
Compared to Herod all the NA servers look empty but Herod had a login queue with at least 11,000 positions in my experience.
---
I wouldn't worry about Fairbanks or really any NA PvP server tbh.

Got Monara, Senko and feld

Horde sorry brotha

Probably... I found it funny though so /shrug.
---
Neither do I my friend
---
That twitch TV for you. Autistic apes spamming chat, just to be a part of the circlejerk.
---
Also gonna have to join global just in case people also make an alt named global chat like some pservers called their /world.
---
Hopefully either everyone just uses lfg or people step up and somehow keep a player moderated global chat channel from becoming an insular forum with personal drama, somehow.
---
Imagine if the entire playerbase wasn't squished into 9 servers, instead of like 40.
---
WTB Blink or Skywalker on Whitemane or Luke/Lucas on Grob
---
Great hindsight
---
I made a bank alt named Bitcoin, mage named Potter, and my mains name wasn’t going to be taken but it’s Rawrshamzar
---
 Nothing all my friends are on Herod, I just didn’t have a great time trying to reserve names on Herod lol
---
I am looking for Percy on Atiesh. It’s my cats name and he’s my wow buddy. I’ll send cat pics!
---
Haha I had the same idea and named my guy “LFR”
---
Got to set up my name on whitemane - horde.  If anyone else is planning to play on there shoot me a dm :)
---
Yes. It replaces flesh lying around on the floor with bread etc. Scholomance is full of fucking bread. It's like a bakery in there.
---
No, r-tard.  Falcorn is a hunter, level 2.
---
Fell asleep 15 minutes before the servers opened, so today I'm tired as hell and have nothing to show for it. All my fucking rage
---
I feel connected to soupa due to our mutual malygosness
---
If you are you're doing it wrong! :)
---
I believe it's reflecting the actual population. Other realms like Whitemane are probably pretty close to being "High" and will be once launch comes.
---
You can use [Blizzard's Looking Glass](http://us-looking-glass.battle.net/) to test your latency to Retail realms, but none of the Classic realms are on there yet. We also don't know which realms will be hosted in which data centers. A PST realm could be hosted in Chicago and an EST realm could be hosted in Los Angeles. So just test one of each from Retail and you'll have a good idea.
---
Looking for Gosu on Heord. Paying a lot
---
I think we'll be [best friends](https://i.imgur.com/UM3r342.png)
---
Legolas, Thex, and Asmongold. Got the 3 names I wanted!
---
Theres a program that can translate in real time if you have the rig to run it and wow.
---
Play a Wralock named HarryDotter !
---
Can't wait to kill you in a BG :D
---
I'm so glad someone didn't take my name "kiuysvuybsdvuytsvbrytv" I copy pasted it 200 milliseconds after character creation without even bothering to alter my appearance because I KNEW someone was trying to take it.
---
Charming will see you on the battlefield, bub
---
Atiesh will most likely be the more popular of the two PvE pacific servers. Myzrael is a dumb name for a server. I will be joining you on Atiesh.
---
Looking for the one with the name Gosu on EU Shazzrah, paying 100€

needs to be dwarf chick ;)

Ich hoffe ja immernoch auf nen RP-PvP Server... War um 0:04 drin, und alle meine Namen die ich mir ausgesucht haben waren weg. Hätte ich echt nicht erwartet. Etwas enttäuschend.
---
What's with the phone pic lol. This is 2019. There are screenshot programs.
---
If you have robzombie on mankrik hit me up and let’s work it out
---
The difference is there's LORE to back all that up, years and years of lore. The difference with Cata was they were flying by the seat of their pants and it didn't hold a candle.
---
If we lived in a perfect world, I would agree with you.  
---
But we don't. We live in a world where 99% of names will be taken by the time the servers come online 2 weeks from now.  
---
And I'm not paying 2 weeks worth of sub time for the *chance* at getting a good name now.
---
You don’t gotta be!
---
Lol rip
---
Stream delay doesn't really help with stream snipers in wow. Unless he puts a 1 hour delay and changes zone every hour. Stream snipers can literally ruin your game experience but it's not a banable offence. What do you suggest he does in this case? Blacklisting douchebags that don't have anything better to do than camp his corpse seems fair. If people want to ruin his experience then he has the right to ruin theirs.
---
technically youre not even allowed to do that on non-rp realms
---
i was able to get my 2 alt names, but i lost my main name.  However, it is what it is.
---
Just really annoying you know.  Then people come in here and have the audacity to blame it on me or anybody else that it happened to, like its because we were incompetent or some shit.
---
I didn’t really have any names that were important to me, should have asked friends if they had any names they wanted held hostage.
---
*whitemale*
---
so are South America and BR
---
Why is he sporting Denmark's colors then?????
---
Eyyyy
---
Turns out you were correct.
---
Sad to say I really wanted the name Hagatha on Grobb so that I could RP the Swamp Queen and lay waste on any foes who cross my path while brewing within the dangerous swamps of Azeroth as a 60 Female Orc Shaman. However, between the constant disconnects and trying to hide away at work to login to do so ended in pure failure. Was looking forward to RPing for the first time too. Told myself I'd roll Grobb if I get the name because I had my heart set on role playing as a swamp witch - looks like RP will have to wait til next time... feelsbadman

Nyeh Heh Heh Heh!
---
Looking for 'Murtagh' on EU Golemagg
---
Got 2 of my 3 names i wanted on both EU PVP servers (same two on both, including my main). So guessing thats pretty good.
---
Free with wow sub. 4 months of playtime to equal a 60 Buck game...which you’ll probably get tired of prior to that
---
Here in Vanilla we don't know of these things "Draenei major city". You must be out of your mind stranger.
---
Dang was gonna use this for my priest. But aybe it works better as a warlock passing out stones to everyone
---
Lots of carbs.
---
What time did it go live? I ended up getting my character names. The one I used in vanilla, and two others. Just wanting to know what time I got on relative to the masses.
---
I think fury was recommended so much because in pservers you could sit to proc enrage. Personally I like getting 5% crit and focusing on arms. Talents like anger management or sweeping strikes are pretty great (so is the tree in general ending in mortal strike)
---
and nobody cares
---
Yeah, I've never had any problem getting names I want in a game and I'm definitely not subbing just to play a stress test. I'd be willing to bet a good chunk of people are in the same boat. Anything that attempts to guess the final number that comes after what they have on paper right now will have a large margin of error.
---
I'd guess they've only seen 20-60% of the real traffic that's going to happen at launch, but even with that wide range, that's just spitballing.
---
Yeah, I mean, who would willingly apply to moderate an internet forum. You have to really hate yourself.
---
That's pretty brilliant... But it would fit better if you could play a murloc.
---
It‘s probably what‘s known as filter bubbles. Feel free to hate it or just to expect it to not impact your gameplay at all. 
---
I fully agree that it is not purist vanilla, but i bet it is the best way to work around the decay of player numbers that the servers will endure through the first few month when only „real Classic/Vanilla fans“ will still be playing and most of those retail kiddies have left for their awful awful Bullshit for Azeroth again.
---
But for real, it‘s probably best way to ensure server capacities used right and won‘t do much harm.
---
Wait... Is that real?
---
I forgot today was the day of reservation and logged in 8 hours late.
---
Luckily though 3 people on the entire planet have used my vanilla name before.
---
My current wow name... rip.
---
In this world it’s kill or be killed.

---
Running wow isnt much.
---
Like no joke.
---
Theres a classic setting then the normal settings.
---
You could use a old chromebook and play wow on classic settings
---
I got Uzi on Arugal too. Solid hunter name.
---
I don't think he is shit. I just think he has a lot of power and knows it. He has the power of an insane amount of followers who will ruin any server by just following him everywhere and spamming every channel. 
---
He can play classic as much as he wants. I don't hate streamers, I watch a good amount of wow streamers. Asmon just has always seemed like he has attitude and I am not a fan. Not trying to ban him, I am sure it appeals to people. Just not a fan
---
No stat blocks for the enemies?

Had a ret pally friend named girly back during TBC. She was the best ret pally i ever knew. She got raped, contracted aids and died from it before wrath came out. I'd love to find the son of a b1tch that did it too.

I'm sure that would be a blast, but I want to be serious about Classic to some degree and I want to make sure everyone gets the experience they want.
---
I will almost for sure roll a toon there eventually as I did Emerald Dream.
---
so why not take in information from the many varied sources you've described and synthesize them into something personally useful.
---
Thats why Zappyboi took so long. He changed majors in his last semester.
---
Have a friend reserve it for you
---
The Aivelynn in the discord might be different. I haven't joined up in a discord yet.
---
I am looking for Doomday on Shazzrath
---
I have had that name on my Orc Warrior since I was 15 back in the vanilla and still have him as my main to this day.
---
All my old guild mates from vanilla times got their main names but I was the only one who didn't get my name for Classic and it sucks more than I thought it would.
---
If anyone knows who got that name I would love to hear from him if we could work things out. I am even willing to pay in rl to get my old boy back to classic.
---
Gnomercy, my friend. Gnomercy.
---
Can't wait, especially being a Horde, strength in numbers is probably going to be pretty helpful during questing. Hopefully we don't slaughter the Alliance so badly that it becomes boring though.
---
Bones, dead people, and gore isn't against laws or anything.  
---
Many companies not based in China will censor their games due to certain regulations put on lawful Game Censorship. While no laws outright say "No spooky skele's, no Zombies, no blood," etc, they tend to be really broad to outside developers. These laws can be interpreted in multiple ways, so to make sure that the game can be released smoothly, without delays, the region's publisher will censor them.
---
Is it Halloween or something at your place still?
---
I didnt realize name res was up until I saw this thread...NOW IM MAD
---
Just as boring as every other class, you hit 2-3 buttons stare at raid frames don’t ever have to move except for a couple fights till Naxx. 
---
Druid pvp is super fun with how many options you have for escape and melee countering. Flag running is super fun when you learn the paths.
---
Nothing all my friends are on Herod, I had to get help from my brother while I was at work and he got bamboozled while saving names he thought he was in Herod and he wasn’t lol.
---
Military? How do you figure that? Military work, fight and die beside people of varying ethnic backgrounds everyday. Show more respect than that.

thank you

Yes.  Open up [Resource Monitor](https://imgur.com/VerRlJ7) (built into Windows, just search it from the start menu).  And open up the WoW client and connect to the realm you want to test.  
---
Go to the "Network" tab.  Check off "Wow.exe" in the top list, then look for the row in the "TCP Connections" list that has Remote Port 3724 - that's the realm server.

I'm Loli and Lolielf on Lucifron &lt;3
---
Also everyone today:
---
"I bet these 150,000 strangers really want to see which names I picked."
---
Run a ping test, not a traceroute. Alternatively, you can ping the main WoW servers yourself:
---
* 137.221.105.2 (US West)
---
* 24.105.62.129 (US Central)
---
That won't be as accurate as pinging a realm, but should give you an idea.
---
well it’s not stress test, it’s for name reservation, and most smart people would just ask a friend with a subscription to reserve their name for them.
---
May the winds guide you
---
It shows users currently logged in, not amount of characters/users
---
So your name means old lady?
---
I'm a bit concerned because I'm getting my friend into WoW, we're going to be on Herod, he's a bit of a casual, not sure if he'll be able to handle the queue times on a daily basis. I'm fine with it because I've played on a lot of dead servers and Herod will probably never reach that point.
---
Looking for Crim on Shazzrah :(
---
A guild members took Feanor :)
---
Meanwhile another guy got "Bigtitgothgf" and apparently that's not mature.
---
Youll be late by then. They got the 2 weeks from now till launch to change the names owner.
---
You said PvE.
---
I'm waiting for September
---
&gt; It seems sorta popular also because of the name being an anagram for horde. A
---
I've never seen anyone mention this.
---
Pagle will be like 80% alliance 20% Horde.  As an alliance player, this probably makes finding players for raiding easy, but BG queues could be a problem.
---
This is false. It's total population.
---
thats only half of why its high, most top private server guilds announced they were going Herod as well
---
Well, it doesn't say Full, so yes.
---
Jokes on you. I got scotch.
---
nah... you can create characters now, or when the servers go online, which is called launch.
---
i think Alex assumes he will behave like an NPC and just die when low hp, rather than pot and try to live
---
It works, great to know.
---
PvE is a necessary part to gearing for pvp...
---
Technically they're paying about $7.50 because half the game time will still be there on launch if they subbed last night
---
I was the one leading the raid to hunt you! Hahahahahaha 
---
Oh man you guys made the last 10 minutes of the stress test so funny: thank you for the fight.
---
I'm Alliance at heart, but Azerothee nevertheless: Lok'tar Ogar, priest.
---
Those pvp server names are so damn lame lol.
---
Your homies should have saved your top pick for you
---
pretty much, everyone who wasnb't blinded by hype knew this was gunna be a niche game
---
That video is some of the funniest shit I've seen in a while, thanks, bro!
---
Lol I don't use my reddit name in WoW
---
I googled a little bit more and found a  solution! =)  
---
The Discord-Ingame-Overlay was causing this problem. Just deactivate it.
---
Even more undeads incoming. Imagine being auto-banned for this little option like at lvl 58, horrifiing.
---
I know it can be run, but I didn't find anyone posting specifically if the Classic would run (and how well) on the current client. My feedback was specifically to note that it runs surprisingly well, and as someone running an MBA as the only machine to play anything, I must confess I'm over the moon!
---
Same here, 2080ti and latest Nvidia drivers.
---
Nope...
---
Instant 'locked' 6000th in queue, name gone 8 mins later when I get in :(
---
When is the deadline for name reservation?
---
You do know that the German-Danish border is kind of the wall, right? This guy there is more likely the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
---
Wait they got subs during the name reservation? Why?
---
While we don't have total confirmation, the language used by Blizzard when describing the name reservation process suggests it will be available from now until launch.
---
So then your guild has no warriors?
---
ugh bitcoin... was expecting something cool and fresh with actual yoloness and swag.
---
V xwxdsxdaq
---
Don’t want kids who can’t handle the slightest inconvenience anyway
---
I’m on my honeymoon, so naturally I forced my sleep deprived younger brother to stay awake (EU) and reserve my name... a very popular elven name.... *on a Tauren*
---
Can’t wait to have the alliance /spit me for the next years to come :)
---
Shaz and Gole was High 8 hours ago.
---
This is like actually showing up at Area 51 instead of just joking about it.
---
All of the launch servers should have very high population, and then settle in over time. I can confirm that Fairbanks was listed at high for a time. You should have a good/reasonable chance at a healthy server.
---
Both Golemagg and Shazzrah were on high an hour after midnight. Pretty sure it shows users currently logged in
---
I think the real Thex already confirmed on which Server he was planning to Play.
---
And also I think he already accepted the fact that he won't get his desired Name :D
---
REALLY sticky glue :)
---
Alpha tested Wildstar with some of the devs and did a lot of the raids. Game was good.
---
Layering should mean no queues..
---
Cringe.
---
What server? I'm Whitemane.
---
That's a good one! I got Grandalf for my gnome mage  ;)
---
It is layering... As soon as they open more layers it will go to Low again
---
Pvp servers filled from only name reservations is a warning signal imo. Pve servers are very low on demand, should switch one to pvp.
---
This sub turned to the_donald real quick
---
I solved it.
---
The irony is that before beta these streamers were seen as paragons of the community because they promoted classic at every turn lmao.
---
My entire horde guild went to fairbanks.  We were part of the coalition of guilds (about 2000 people, almost evenly split between alliance and horde) than went to fairbanks.  Lots of older players.  Cool group of people.  Very different vibe than Whitemane.  But we logged on, saved names, and logged off.  Went from full to medium to low pretty quickly.
---
Hey! I'll be doing that, see you there
---
Will be available until launch
---
I don't know.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/W2C62u9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/W2C62u9.jpg) Are You threatening me master Jedi?
---
Yeah very good point, I guess it's only possible if you have 2 accounts.
---
Weird.  Used to play on a full server, and it said medium at 3am every night.  I guess people deleted their toons after every session.
---
It's great to have your name but I would rather use a different name and play on a healthier server. though I'm sure it will still be ok I would worry some after a year and a half how it was doing if it's already low pop now idk though
---
SVEN OF WHITEMANE PLEASE HEAR MY CALLS.
---
My champion has certainly risen.
---
Apparently the /s is needed
---
I paid basically $7.50 to get the names Pvp, Bow, and Gore on fairbanks. It was worth it in my opinion.
---
West coast is best coast. Whitemane 4ever.
---
Then make the other ones tank
---
That's false, there's plenty of screenshots and videos of people in the same party getting layered from each other. It happened to me in the stress test.
---
Igetganked
---
if anyone has Zoë on Pagle, then please lmk. I don’t have a super compelling story, but it’s my first name so &lt;3
---
They did not. They could loose more money cuz of bad press.
---
Also people need active sub to reserve names, so they took our money for name reservation.
---
I think blizzard is correct. A lot of people will drop off when they realise what classic is
---
There's just no way. It's 3AM here and we still have realms on High. And our realms have barely changed at all. They *might* be relative so that Golemagg dropped to Medium when Shazzrah eclipsed it, but there's just now way it's live population.
---
Have fun in your other games!
---
Pvp, good twink name. Like it in that context. You shall be feared on the battlefield!
---
While I can understand people concerns, what they do forget is after the initial rush. It will be streamers that will be key to keeping a server going for YEARS to come should they continue to play of course.
---
Our biggest worry initially was the server being Alliance Dominated though now it should be pretty even.
---
In regards to streamers its very much down to how they handle their viewer base and at the end of the day some guild masters have a small private army of their own.
---
It makes no sense to actively grief a player, your just taking time out of your own game and your own leveling etc. Sure I expect some people will do it but at the end of the day thats because those people are trying to make themselves internet famous. So, honestly what i'd say to players is just respect people like you'd want to be respected, now of course that doesn't mean always avoid fights but you know just play your character and have fun.
---
We are all here to play the same game.
---
We were more than 40, splitted into 2 raids: a Paladin was leading the charge, a Warrior finally got him: I was the mage leading the raid defending Goldshire. They were few, but put on a very rough fight. 
---
See you in Azeroth, friend!
---
It’s actually hilarious how much you guys hate streamers.
---
I don't get something about this /r tbh...people here seem to despise Streamers like Asmongold (that I can understand), but you talk about him all the time nevertheless.
---
Why?
---
When something annoys me, I ignore it. I don't let it live rent-free inside my head.
---
Are retail tourists logging in at midnight on a workday to sit in a 45min queue to create a character they cant play with for 2 weeks?
---
See you there!
---
some german streamers, Unge and his friends, roll on Luciforn/Alliance (German PvP). But there fanbase/community is no where near the size as from NA streamers.
---
I just wanted a Dwarf paladin named HolyMoly :( Settled for Shortround
---
But it was in vanilla, right? I swear it must've been.
---
I'd suspect all of those names are blacklisted. Maybe Achilles is available, but ASoIaF and LotR character names are certainly blocked completely.
---
96 ping on Whitemane and 55 ping on Thalnos. Darn. Whitemane is the only server where one of the names I want is available.
---
Huh, you're right. My bad, man.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cppht4/did_someone_get_eq_on_arugal_and_if_youre_not_too/). 
---
He should designate a character to only play with you, at your speed, while having other characters to power level on his own if he chooses. 
---
It's not going to be fun for you if you feel rushed IMO. There will be a lot to learn, but that's truly a fun aspect of any new game with the right mentality. This is an RPG at its core, so delve into the RP aspect while enjoying the journey, IMO. 
---
Just remember, there are tons of online resources if you feel overwhelmed, but there is no rush to do anything in an MMORPG, as there is no real finish line anyways. 
---
Best of luck :)
---
The backlash would cost them more than they'd ever earn.
---
Reddit neckbeards don't understand optics that's why they don't care about their appearance.
---
Is it so?
---
https://imgur.com/L8BRNqF
---
&gt; If I have 3 servers to choose from, I’m much more likely to run into people I know/knew/had friends in common with.
---
If I have 12 servers to choose from I’m less likely to meet people I used to know/etc. 
---
Except that's not the case, because the 3 servers will be split into a dozen layers each.
---
Alternatively they changed the definitions on what constitutes low, medium and high from the original.
---
Based on what I can find online 20-30k total accounts per server (not online at once of course) active within 30 days would have been enough to consider the sever high or full. Whilst queuing for name reservation on one server I was 11k in line and this was the second server I did so it was probably 20 minutes or more after reservation opened. That server currently just says low but it seems probable that it actually has more accounts than a high server would have had back in the day.
---
I played an Undead Priest on Barthilas named Parabol
---
I was able to make Rhaegar on different server.
---
Tbf after first hour the last two expacs have be absolutely fine. I have no doubt it'll be similar
---
Dagger Rogue is fine, but it's generally still combat until AQ+ gear, and even then it's a seal fate/combat hybrid to my understanding.  You won't really get to play any variant of Hemo in 40 mans because of debuff slots, and Sin/Sub hybrid builds don't seem all that competitive outside of it.
---
It's probably advantageous to have at least 1-2 Rogues in a guild running daggers just so the drops aren't wasted.  The gap isn't that big that you'll do more damage as a sword Rogue with pre-BiS blues vs Perd's/Core Hound Tooth iirc.  The upside of opting to play daggers is that you aren't forced to be Human on Alliance if you don't want to be.
---
I plan on doing it myself, and with a bit of luck I'll get to be the snowflake dagger user in my guild and luck out with drops early.
---
Why are people calling Thalnos the BR server? The survey only shows that like 6% will speak portuguese, am i missing something?
---
What rocks/minerals are on your desk?
---
I saw ' Bigusdickus' run around on the stress test realm for a couple of days...
---
Real legend
---
Same happened to me. And my name is taken of course :(
---
Looking for 'Ketsu' or 'Mynd' on Shazzrah. PM!
---
Is your friend 12 ?

So because i said don’t worry i implied it’s bad.

---
As always, I love these little pros / cons images you make! I would, however, disagree a bit about World PvP as survival, I'd say i is better than BM. The only time BM outshine it is basically right when you ding 60 and have full greens - as soon as you get pre-raid BiS or close to it and for the rest of vanilla I'd go with SV. Also, the main advantage of BM is how the pet is OP at first, but when other people start to gear up the pet looks less impressive. Actually, even for BG's I wouldn't put BM as a green check.
---
But otherwise, great job!
---
WTB Turbo on Arugal. Hit me up!
---
Nope. Brewfest wasn't added until 2007 during patch 2.2.2. We were well into TBC by then.
---
We don't know how many players required for the server to be on high. In vanilla high was 2k+ online users? and 2k users at 3AM is very likely
---
Really not sure on this one though. Correct me if wrong :)
---
HAHAHAHAHAH!
---
congratz, i was trying to get mine but: dsadwqendsaiuuegg was taken xD
---
I'm for sure going to have an alt on an rp pvp server. I love 'em, but my friends don't. Herod should be uh, fun tho
---
Got put into a 10k queue 3 times when i got booted from Shazz on EU to another server twice in a row, managed to get in and secure my names with 10 minutes to spare... the relief was real
---
That's what I'll do if there's no definitive hub for all of it. Is there a reason everyone in this sub is being as unhelpful as possible?
---
Ideally, yes. I am new to this system, so looking forward to seeing what it can do.
---
Then they haven't kept up with the times. I haven't played WoW since GoT became big, but back in 2005 the LotR names were blocked completely and I would have expected the same for AsoIaF/GoT today.
---
I wanted Dirge for my priest. All names on my list were taken so I wound up being Darkpact. Pretty good name, can't complain.
---
I have Hog on Thalnos. Will trade that and my soul for my real name, Dante. Make me an offer with another name tho :)
---
That would defeat the point entirely. The purpose of showing the population is to attract people to register on low servers to fill them out rather than crowding into servers that are already packed. If the player registered at 3am or whatever a high server could then read as low.
---
As far as I am aware the figures are based on how many accounts have been active within 30 days.
---
In theory, what you describe is possible...
---
* If there always is some trustwrthy person online
---
* If everyone who holds owner privileges knows how to use chat-control commands
---
* If everyone who holds owner privileges bothers to transfer ownership to a new trustworthy person every time before logging out
---
* If not one of the trustworthy persons ever disconnects accidentially
---
* If not one of the trustworthy persons ever has a bad day, gets drunk, lets his little brother play or gets emotional over something
---
So Asmon and the other streamers only have enough of a following to get a medium server rank? When Asmon along had around 80k watching him make his character.
---
I'm a bit into holy pvp. Looks sick. Just need to find a nice pvp video XD
---
**¿ ¡QUE!?**
---
You are right it was source
---
They did make a bit if money. Many people had returned to get their names. If you just want just  subscribed now and you don't want to play retail then you are going to waste 15 days of gametime for a name.
---
Holy shit, you’re going to play Classic? Nice. The whole fiasco with your name and the guy trolling you is one of my first reddit memories.
---
Epic last stand, gamer
---
I was able to grtDemonshlong &amp;DarthRevan. How long before I'm forced to change it? That's the real mystery
---
I dont know exactly what you're trying to show 9 hours after registration opened. On us realms everything but rp was either medium or high, now theres 6 low pop. This isn't even counting those who refuse to use game time on half a month of waiting.
---
I thought it was a drenei
---
The way everyone plays it - hell literally more than half the specs in the game are useless to raid with. Mechanically it's not a very good game, but that's more than made up for by the feel.
---
The person who got it is giving the name to him
---
Auctionator - this is the minimum auction add on for any version of wow. It works, but there is a cosmetic bug with the auction lengths.
---
EZJunk - no issues at all
---
DBM - I installed it, had no problems but no tests either.
---
XandY -- it worked, but I am not convinced its my favorite version of map coords. No issues though.

Perceived low point? This grown ass man is screaming at the top of his lungs out of anger for a videogame. There is no "perceived" here, that's what he's doing. Normal people don't have genuinely intense reactions to petty things like that, he's a man child and seems unbearable to be near
---
Just make a load of servers and if they die merge them with other dying ones until you have 2-3 active ones.. if they don't die woo
---
I've probably rewatched their vids over 50 times, haha.
---
I was right too.
---
I think one misconception people have is that the people in retail care about classic.  They really don't care that much.  It seems highly probable to me that launch day won't be quite as chaotic as people are thinking.   I am sure a lot of the retail people will swarm in on release day, but most will sort of trickle in over time.
---
Cheers, I'll give it a look. Thank you for being literally the only person in the thread to recommend something.
---
Plus he's ganking the dude...complain about potions in a duel?  Understandable because there are unwritten but widely understood rules for etiquitte in duels.  But you don't get to bitch about it when you try to gank someone - ESPECIALLY when you have an absolutely massive level advantage like that.

My raiding guild is about 55 people all late 20s/30s. Apparee our gm met with other GMs to decide on fairbanks. Seems server is looking like a good strong OG community
---
And the Fork of Truth!
---
yeah it's weird, i think right now it might be bugged where if anyone on any of the servers has the name then it says unavailable.
---
im rolling on fairbanks and it shows as low pop atm, and a BUNCH of my names that are basically never taken are all gone, it's insane.
---
Whoever got Atomsk on Pagle...
---
I don't actually want the name now since I got my primary choices (Atomsk was my backup plan), I just wanted to compliment you on your good taste. I didn't really expect anyone to grab that one so early.

That is all.

To add to the list

Their followers will pretty much make sure that no one else has even a chance of s scarab lord
---
These worked fine for me, most important is the questing anyway:
---
*Questie + FasterLooting + EZJunk + dashingDismount*
---
Although didn't try dashing but it loaded and didn't give errors. EZJunk not just auto sells but have vendor value.
---
Now, every UI replacements I tried was broken. Some others deleted core features from the game like PvP flagging or pet management, or broke my other addons (OmniCC).
---
My advice is to not download UI replacements or any other addon that isn't really relevant up until endgame if you don't want to frustrate yourself.
---
I just went with the most important aspects for leveling and used these for Interface enhancement:
---
*OmniCC + Classic Aura Durations  + Classic Enemy Cast Bars + Real Mob Health*
---
I went further and customized it a bit more with:
---
*TipTac + Kui Nameplates + TomTom + OneBag3*
---
Then I tried some minor help addons like:
---
*Weapon Swing Timer + Five Second Rule* 
---
For Raiding as a healer I plan on using these addons, but I'm not touching them after hitting 60:
---
*HealComm  + DBM + Clique + Details*
---
I don't feel like messing around with AH addons early on, but I'll plan on using these:
---
*Auctioneer + Aux*

---
Yes I am afraid of them, but you don't need to wait until classic, you can do it anytime in the next two weeks, I'm going to wait for about a week and do it in the middle of the night/early morning.
---
He could reconfigure that name in a week when not many people are trying. Just figure out the way you want your character to look then it only takes 30 seconds to set it all up when you want to redo it.
---
There are no bones underneath too
---
It's too late to switch since that would fuck so many people over on their name reservations.
---
Close enough ;)
---
I'd love to hear your reasoning for choosing total characters over current population as a metric.

---
That’s false... there’s no indication of faction imbalance yet.
---
well the confirmed one is our main tank, and the 2nd usually plays dps classes so I’m almost certain he’ll go dps or just roll another class. I think what i will end up doing is talking to my guild if they don’t mind me going fury &amp; if need be I’d play tank as an off-role.
---
Depending on the class. some classes have such high gph farming methods that it isn't even a barrier for them.

Seems to be a misnomer.

But of course this is not a Korean RPG so I acknowledge the limitations.

How about [a blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/246645)?
---
&gt; Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms.
---
It wouldn't make sense to use live numbers if your goal is to help people decide on a realm.
---
got the wrong information
---
And beast masters won’t get their pets healed most of the time in raids. OP underestimates survival because it’s not cookie cutter.
---
Why stop there? What about equipping an item permanently binds it to you? No taking bathroom breaks or you have to delete your character? Castrating yourself if you wipe in a dungeon?

Got my Name in every Server except the one i wanted to Play on
---
'Salty' Seamen the Human fisherman with 'Salty' title attached from WTLK -&gt; BFA checking in.
---
These Keyboard tho, a man of culture i see.
---
Do you like my name? Söméöné
---
they do it FOR FREE
---
He’s already stated that he will, whenever the content dries up. And he said that could be fairly quick for him, considering he plays 16 hours a day
---
Well, the more the better, right?
---
Yeah, curious as to why Golem went back to Normal again...
---
It all started with the "Make Azeroth Great Again" rubbish tbh.
---
Popular character or real life person names are generally blacklisted to avoid lawsuits.
---
I don't know how thorough they are, but in my day I never saw anybody with a LotR character name, that wasn't messed with accents or whatever.
---
Imagine being so poor $7.5 for playing a game for 4 days is too expensive then acting like it's everyone else there's something wrong with.

Wow he does what he wants.. what a badass
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Looking for the name Alias on Pagle, I have no alternate names, don’t make me use special characters. Let’s work out something please friend.
---
Hanzo - Hunter
---
Reinhardt - Warrior
---
Fairbanker here. Pretty convinced blizz will make a post saying that Whitemane and Herod are significantly over capacity and will recommend people swap to avoid queues.
---
even if release is playble if the pop drop off isnt huge phase 2 ques are gonna hurt.
---
On Herod Feanor was taken immediatly. I grabbed Fingolfin but switched him for Glaurung so he may still be available.
---
I do want dem cookies? At herod right?
---
anyone have the ign "mars" in whitemane or fairbanks. willing to pay or trade igns
---
Wanted Hydrohomie for my Mage, got Holyhomie for my Priest alt.
---
Got Hydrohomie on RP server but won't be using it there.
---
See ya on white mane
---
Congratulations and all the best to Korea!
---
It's definitely a thing
---
I tried my best to keep it English, but there's only so many of us and a seemingly endless amount of Russians...
---
I have done it twice.
---
I did it once at the start of BC, and the accounts had to have the same Surname on them. The idea was that familys that shared an account could split the characters up. I transferred a 60 rogue to a new account, and then gave the account to a guildie who had lost his account.
---
Towards the end of BC I made a second wow account for myself, transferred a character and dual box leveled in WOTLK. When bnet accounts became a thing, I was able to merge both wow accounts to the one bnet account. This means all my account wide stuff is shared between my two accounts, because they are on the same bnet account.
---
Shmee for warrior  
---
Thursty for priest  
---
Mim for rogue  
---
I just wanted a better selection. Wasn't going for anything too novel.
---
Jambi was taken from me :(
---
I got "wack" on 2 realms and "Moonboi"
---
It does not. If you have a friend help you get your alt into the same group as your main, you can logoff your main and use the alt to reset the instance, but that's the best you can do.
---
I managed to get Zaxz, Exe and Execute.
---
See! That is a nice move :) glad for thex :D
---
By some, you literally mean one, soda?
---
Herod is going to be the place to be.
---
Poor effort at trolling
---
Did someone get Richter on Whitemane? Our GM is crossing his fingers.
---
Anecdotally, among white guys ive known who’ve gone through the military, their “race doesn’t mean anything” nonchalant attitude towards race generally manifests in excessive amounts of racial humor, which over time once out—given they stop socializing with blacks, Asians and Mexicans crystallizes into real racism. 
---
It’s not true for all of them, but there is a noticeable group.
---
Literally each sentence.. R U me? 
---
If that’s any consolation man, fuck blizzard
---
I made a guild named Boko Harambe  it didn't last long  I'm going straight to hell.
---
That video is clearly satirical and self-mocking.

Herod is nothing compared to Shazzrah EU

Tim was the first name I tried taking since its my actual name, I got in instantly and it was still taken.
---
No need to worry if you delete the character the name is still taken for you for some time and only you can create new character with that name. Idk how long that period is but it's long enough to create new char.
---
ELI5 for someon who doesn’t play WoW?
---
Better pay well
---
Took me 49 minutes to get in lol. Lucky my name's aren't super simple.
---
Making you the predictable one!
---
As if not sanic everyone knows he is way faster then sonic....
---
After you get it, we need another interview on Countdown to Classic :D
---
&gt; o if he is really committed to the game and wants to play ASAP, there is a good chance you can snipe the name in that reconfiguration time frame some minutes after release.
---
No? He's gonna delete the character and recreate it sometime between now and release.
---
So im following a bunch of friends over to Fairbanks from retail, and I've only played off and on since cata. Could you please fill me in on what a good, strong, OG server looks like, and the common etiquette, etc.?
---
Some EU servers had queues during name reservation as well
---
&gt; IMO it's mainly fearmongering 
---
For most countries, I'd agree - but I can't say I'm not happy with a French realm. Been living in France for the past 6 months and while I've been a lot in Italy and Spain, France was much different. I was pretty shocked at how much they simply refused to speak English. I knew the stereotype of French hating English and all that, but I didn't really believe it to be so true. Should be noted that people in their 20's tended to be much more open to English. I assume teenagers are fine as well, didn't really talk with any.
---
Not trying to hate on the French, they can do what they want in their own country - but it is understandable why people might fear their realm becoming an "unofficial language realm".
---
Shitface ಠ⌣ಠ

Gotta dissapoint ya m8

Thanks for letting me experience the game I always wanted to play as a kid but was severely limited by Dial-up and being an Aussie.

Killerbean on Shazzrah. Name your price!
---
On Grobbulus I have "Prometheus" and "Orcus" for trade.
---
LF "Messatsu" on Shazzrah, been using it for years. DM me and let's talk!
---
No need to to the command for the character. Just Google German special characters. Copy and paste the letters you need into the message.
---
Simple.
---
Definitely. Without streamers, I think it’ll be the experience most similar to vanilla.
---
With a name like Liverpoo, I might have to be forced to rename. I think I'd get the name even a year later 😁
---
What dungeon specifically are you trying to farm? I may have some strats for you involving master loot.
---
I mean, I was in a queue 15K deep just for Herod, we wont really know until the day after Classic launches and then maybe a few weeks after that. These populations *are* semi live populations though
---
One thing not to screenshot another to break necks with your camera angle.
---
Edgy
---
I logged on this morning, 7 hours AFTER the name reservation. Shazzarah PVP EU was STILL on high population. Point being, it never dropped from the HIGH pop, even 7-9 hours later.
---
got the same as i was sitting in the log in screen, it is so epic. The music... just imagining walking through that big portal
---
Ever get your name, dude?
---
Wow is a social game, you will make new friends!
---
# Looking for Toetag on Pagle.
---
That was my father's character name back in vanilla up until when he quit retail and the one he'd used for his priest on places not to be mentioned after that. He's coming back to the game to play with us after several years.
---
Having the name won't make or break playing the game for him, but I'd like to try to get it for him. If you're not too attached to the name, please toss me a message here. It'd really mean a lot to me.
---
It's really sad that a lot of people seriously behaved this way. 30 something year old people who didn't learn patience growing up playing WoW all day.
---
source: refer to rage thread.
---
Polling means absolutely nothing. It only represents a few people on reddit who saw the poll and bothered to fill it out.

Alliance or horde
---
how does it update? im horde on faerlina but unsure if my data has been added
---
Great for you! It seemed weird to me that community as hyper-competetive as the Koreans wouldn't get a PvP server.
---
Nope not if you haven't logged in to the character, soon as it's deleted it's open for anyone.
---
Oh, just wait. It will be full before launch.
---
Nice.
---
Nope. I welcome them.
---
I'm not an r-tard.. :(
---
inces
---
Well or edit it
---
I just find it funny because the name I was using in beta was "bigdickbob" but you cant have poo.
---
Female Taurens are... Hideous.
---
So i need active game time to actually pick up a name right?
---
Thereis only 1 sub. After you subscript you can play with both version.
---
I’ve played in multiple raiding guilds over the years where accented main toon character names were a non starter. We wouldn’t even consider them.
---
Don't give them any ideas

He will have to go over there whether he likes it or not
---
LOL this is where I met some new friends! If this is on Thandol'Span, it is me lying on the ground there
---
No, Shiftace. My Druid is an Ace shapeshifter.
---
I'm chaos everywhere and I didn't get it without special characters. Year ruined :(
---
I'd say a 10k queue just to create a character, two weeks before release at midnight in the middle of the week should be proof enough that there aren't enough servers.
---
My IRL friends are facing the same problem. I’m hoping to at least run dungeons together every weekend or something like that. Maybe some group quests? Who’s to say?
---
I'll take that opening in the knee.
---
that's a good name too, but i was think about you edging me
---
It’s nonconsensual
---
You are on the wrong server anyway. Swolemagg FTW
---
Grobbulus has something like 51/49 between alliance and Horde respectively; although it's RPPVP.
---
*Pash the whishky*

it will be simulated by 2 hour queue times. Herod is gonna be more packed than the streamer server.
---
Sorry my bad. Only acceptable solution is to delete the post.
---
Did you see their stock plummet after announcing Diabo Immortal?  7 percent was nothing to sneeze at.  Also they were promised new assets for it but the mobile game maker copied a ton of assets.  They're currently sitting on it (its done on the developer side)  we'll see what or if they release it.

---
Yeaaay! Plamegor rules &lt;3 mother russia
---
Good one
---
ok im way out of the loop here, what is the streamer controversy right now and why do we not want them on normal servers?
---
Also, is it better to be on a the side with lower or higher pop? I’d imagine world pvp would be rougher against lower pop side, but bg queue’s should be better (or does battlegroups negate that)?
---
[I don't believe you](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=namesprofanity&amp;build=1.13.2.31446#search=beer&amp;page=1).
---
Whenever I require my daily does of NaCl I go to his stream. It always amazes me how toxic one can be.
---
RP realms are going to have a huge community of older players who want maturity and civility...you won't have guilds rushing for world first but you won't have as many children, so it's a distinct trade off.
---
You obviously did not play the game or know what iirc and ventrillo are, lol. How would you think a raidgroup cleared mc for the first time, without coms?
---
My friend has Magi on Arugal
---
I'm sorry but why do people want to play on different server than streamers? I never played WoW but this Classic hype got me excited to give it a try.
---
What server should I play on?
---
In terms of keeping the server going, I would rather say that players that are as involved as you do that job. Streamers are just the people taking that frame you've build to promote themselves.
---
Luckily chat addons can auto block all that shit!
---
We're gonna need some proof for that
---
Is that a guild wars reference on the 3rd name? If so, very much underrated! Nothing says druid like a hovering, lightning slinging plant with a funky hairdo.
---
No. I don't want to work harder for a person making a bad choice.
---
Hahaha good one :D
---
It appears we both got screwed today, there is a 3rd Alias out there somewhere.
---
Apparently it can be considered derogatory for Asian.
---
WTB Solo on Golemagg
---
Beer was on the list of names I tried on the stress test, but banned. Booze works and was one of the names I was going to reserve. 
---
Sadly, I got in super quick, had the "creation is only available to players that have a character on this server" message, backed out because I was impatient, and wasn't able to get back in before I had to go to work.
---
Wasn't able to snag any of the names I wanted on either of the servers I was going to play on. :(
---
&gt; Please get a brain :(
---
Said Alex's brown noser. 
---
Imagine being somebody's blind follower, let alone blind follower of this toxic loser.
---
Mages, rogues and depending on the enemy mobtypes also warlocks or priests can keep 1 mob cc'd reliably and with very little effort.
---
But a really good hunter can keep 1 mob (of ANY mobtype) perma frozen, kite an entire mob pack or a boss endless until his group has dealt with whatever else, and offtank 1 or even 2 mobs with his pet all at the same time. Additionally he's one of the few classes that can easily deal with 1 or 2 mobs completely on his own and his pet, maybe with some occasional small heals, which helps groups staying cool and focused during mispulls or other tough situations.
---
I was given a choice by my friend of two servers our old guild was likely to go to, picked the one I liked the name of and offered to save her name as well. A half hour of loading screen, DCs and queue lines I got our names.
---
They chose the other server.
---
You want to be on a balanced server.  Either way is bad
---
Why do people avoid streamers?
---
Personally I'd rather be on the low pop side.  More alli scum for me to hunt.
---
Yes they are dynamic.  The EU PVE servers at one point were 'High' then downgraded to 'Medium' as, presumably, the PVP realms filled up.
---
The labels are there to encourage people to roll on non-High servers.
---
Unless your the party leader and are not the one in the town inviting.
---
I would assume most pvp severs will have 56%ish horde were pve will be 56% alliance
---
Illegal Danish
---
Create alts you only play together, and play your main any other time, maybe?
---
horde side should be tolerable with tips and the more tame streamers. But  yeah Herod is where itll be at.
---
Sorry, but I’m not actually in the ‘layering has ruined the game before launch’ boat...perhaps try the comment below??
---
&gt; great YouTube content but malicious streamer
---
I was in his guild on a fresh TBC server a long time ago. Didn't take long to realize that he was an even bigger dickhead than either his YT or stream let on. The server was really low pop, and his guild dominated the horde side, basically the whole faction was in the guild. He would blacklist certain people that, for whatever reason, he had a grudge against and prevent guild members from grouping with the blacklisted players.
---
Just to be clear, this can be done with your level 1 bank alt, you just need a friend to get your alt into the party and your alt needs to be leader?
---
after finishing a run, you log out on your main and log back in with your alt, reset instances, then log back in with your main?
---
Ah, fair enough mate. I created it and posted it here yesterday. Glad it got put to good use I suppose, haha. Good luck on your grind!
---
I've got the names Ariel and Fable on Thal. Not parting with Ariel but the other I don't care much for as I'm only playing one character. With that said I'm not trading it until I do my ultimate appearance change in a week or so.
---
Nice copypasta.
---
&gt; Trap is the only long duration CC in the game that works on any type of enemy.
---
Blind?
---
Also most high level dungeons have humanoids in them.
---
Yep and I remember there was no internet.. I had to bring my computer to my friend's house and did WoW LAN party.
---
You mean hundreds of dollarydoos?
---
They do, it means "Dark Enemy" while Melkor means "He Who Arises in Might."
---
https://i.imgur.com/UpWSqKl.jpg
---
&gt; kite an entire mob pack or a boss endless until his group has dealt with whatever else,
---
Maintaining aggro on a whole pack is almost impossible. You'd have to multishot them all and pray no one else gets any aggro. Also you'd need the dungeon to be half cleared to kite.
---
Maraudon mostly :) Please do tell
---
Is that supposed to turn me off?
---
I'd say that based on a single day if name reservation that this will be a dead server
---
gachiBASS
---
Yeah get fucked mate.
---
I was thinking about it but the truth is that I am the one with less time to play and I get it if my friend doesn't want to waste time on a "pointless" alt.
---
Thanks, I'll look into it a little more and decide what to do. Main reason I was wondering is cause I'm close to buying my own PC but I'm also looking for a job atm so I can make the rest and be able to pay for my own account.
---
Remember these are going t be super super fresh servers...no one is going to have the gold to power level professions for weeks, months...profession choice on these new servers is going to be hugely important.
---
A man of culture I also have a warrior Gastton (Lefou taught me to spil)
---
Nice I was wondering who got it
---
For your own sake, go outside. Do something else and gain some perspective. 
---
Fucking christ
---
&gt; 135 AP from LR and a bit more than 2% crit. TSA gives you 100 AP, but even ignoring the extra 400 AP it grants to a group (and that the 400 AP will go to rogues and warriors that gain more DPS per AP, thus making it even stronger) - you just ignored all the other talents.
---
You forget the Hit.
---
&gt;450 agility? Based on what? 
---
Theorycrafting sites that I was browsing on LH while I raided AQ/Naxx.
---
I'm doing the same. After today's shit show regarding Herod and not getting any one of my three names there, I managed to get my #1 name on Grobbulus out of pure luck. 
---
So, I'm thinking that will be my new home. I'm East coast, but the ping is not a big enough of a difference for it to affect my gameplay at all with my internet. Besides I played on a PST server in retail wow forever.
---
I didn't get my name :/ makro on shazzar I hope you're happy!!

Classic alliance. No blood, grimacing or corpses to be seen.

It’s insane how much better everything looks in wow classic.

---
Probably wont be battlegroups with this small of servers. All of them will probably be connected.
---
“My brother n I decided for that server because toxic guilds or streamers won't join”
---
Guess you haven’t heard about the Defias WPvP community, the only thing which used to make one RP-PvP server relatively populated.
---
I'll never have as much fun in the game as I did when I first started playing and had no idea what I was doing.  Having said that, the stress test weekend was a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to playing in two weeks.  I plan to keep my head down, avoid the drama, and have as much fun as I can.
---
Thank you for giving me the rundown on everything.  Really appreciate it.
---
There's one price. It's $15. You get access to both for that. If you choose to only play Classic for that $15 great. However you also have access to retail, whether you use it or not is up to you.

Hey, glad to hear. I'm EU so I'm not super invested in this, but glad to hear there's common sense happening all around.

I know I wouldn't want to play on the same server as you guys, but that doesn't mean I don't watch your streams (especially since it's been the only way to get my classic fix between stress tests).

Everybody blows you a kiss

Makes no sense. The code shouldn't allow it.

Well, if it ain't allowed mods will take care of it. 
---
Yeah.. that sucks.. My name is still available on literally all servers except lucifron.. Just checked.. Makes me feel so bad.. I knew something would happen to ruin my classic experience eventually..
---
Woah!
---
Honest answer?
---
No one knows. 
---
You can speculate however, of all the server types  RP-PVP is the most niche. It will have the highest risk of all servers of becoming a dead server.
---
On live they aren't popular, but no one knows what the population drop off for classic will be like. If its something youre into help foster the community!
---
LF Ymir on Herod
---
&gt; It's also literally the best spec for dungeons because of trap mastery.
---
Why would you even need a dungeon spec? Most endgame dungeons are easy.
---
And no, I disagree, a SV Hunter will do far less for a group than a MM one. Trap mastery isn't even needed. Trueshot and the MM talents do way more damage than SV does at lvl 60, unless you're ridiculously geared.
---
Weird Thex, but ok.
---
Does anybody want my Toes on Herod?
---
Small chance, but if someone has "Evelina" on Mirage Gateway and is willing to give it up, ping me, a bit sad I missed it since I've had it since closed beta.

Its been almost 10 years, I want to say his character name was Turyia or something similar. I found out much later that he passed away from nose bleed from hemophilia.

If Rockclimber, the other GM reads this, hope you are doing well.
---

---
If he did, it could have a million reasons other than "annoying streamer fans". I always roll alts on different servers cause I like not having anything on that server and not knowing anyone.
---
Looking for Nero on Arugal, name your price.
---
On the stress test i saw a gnome mage called "bfaisbetter". 
---
Yep, he successfully triggered me
---
Opposite on my end....I hope Classic is massively popular, they pull some time warp fuckery in Retail, and open the option for new Classic material in a new timeline, keeping the items small, the itemization by spec and preference, and never adding any of the new shit that came with WoTLK....maybe a little of TBC, but skip it if they want.
---
I can wave to this guy, hello

---
Got my name - Mul after making it on the wrong server twice.
---
Number 4 got disconnected after waiting an hour for servers to come up, had to wait in a long queue before getting in finally. We began listing names off the top of our heads for him. Needless to say he went to bed unhappy and with no names reserved. On behalf of him, screw whoever took Luke and Lukey that's all the poor guy wanted.

Alright. Well, I’m really not concerned of one guild, when there’s these ”coalitions” of thousand of players and several guilds. Who cares. Someone will fight them back
---
I wan't "Nope" on Atiesh. I've had a warrior named "Nope" for the last 10 years. Really bummed it got nabbed :(

I never thought it would be the case but r/cricket is so much like that. Banter can be great but all must march in step with the overriding opinion or be nuked to downvote hell

I got Jinzo and a frost mage named Ghiaccio because I’m a raging weeb

My mage is named Foodnwater

I used Azeroth auto pilot. Worked great. If you’re looking for a quest add on I would grab that one.

That’s all I used for now. They all worked fine.

They can act like grown ups and deal with their issues or they can scream like toddlers at a videogame. Seems like a touchy subject for you, maybe the guy in the video isnt the only one who needs to grow up? I can assure you 100% that anyone who's ever seen you scream at a videogame thought you were a pathetic manchild

Wanted Richard got Richard :)

Is there a way to report the 4th guy's second name outside of the game? For, you know, reasons.

But will it make Al Gore breed?

Do I need to call Walmart and have a nationwide ban on you from entering?
---
I don't even know why it's still being discussed. It's set, and Blizz isn't going to change their mind. It is what it is.
---
Same
---
Beautiful.
---
lol nice
---
Seriously, grow tf up
---
Please if some has ; maybe, asdf, or cassiusclay PM me
---
just pointing out the painfully obvious
---
I didn't reserve my name because I don't have a PC right now.
---
F for me.
---
But my name isn't that common so hopefully it won't be taken until tomorrow...
---
Your parents brought you into this world. A life was provided for you, your future was hoped about. They wondered "what will this child grow up to do? Discover a cure for a disease? Explore space?"
---
And then you created this.
---
I just wanted shook on Thalnos. 
---
I was there at 5 sharp on the creation screen and didn't know I should just spam the create button until while ignoring the 'cannot create character etc etc.
---
I restarted and got back in, took about 6 minutes to get back onto the character screen and the name was taken. And then the next 20 of my first choice backups were claimed as well.
---
Very useful, thank you.
---
Yeah I managed to get 5 on my chosen realm, only issue is that I didn't customise them so will need to wait until full launch to delete and remake otherwise it'll reimpose the limit and I won't be able to remake it.
---
Best case scenario, Blizzard opens up some more PVP servers and gives Herod people first dibs at free migration (and thus first dibs at the character names).
---
It would split the community up, at least for a good while, but it will let people play without abandoning their names.
---
But I don't see Blizzard doing this. They will wait to see who gets fed up with the queue, and voluntarily goes to one of the other existing servers. They also want to avoid having to merge later, and this will drive decisions even with a lot of people getting upset.
---
get a more unique name.
---
I heard that it was tested and didn't work on mining/herb nodes.
---
Also multiple people skinning the same mob was possible in vanilla.
---
Are you talking about the survey made by English speakers for English speakers on an English speaking site? If that survey shows 6% Portuguese then that has some scary implications.
---
Nah, every body in that circle of streamers agreed to go to Faerlina. This was just Asmond being hyperbolic after he got his names on Faerlina. Sounds like Esfand was a driving force in trying to keep the peace. A noble, and ultimately futile effort, but I appreciate the dude for trying.
---
Pretty sure he was joking
---
I never said he made 1 mil a month, I just said he makes more than 100k
---
Stfu
---
HAHA, first legit name reserving post on this sub. You got my vote :)
---
Ruin your classic experience? Lol
---
You should see if the name dog shit is taken.
---
Haha wtf is Wrong With people, hes fucking messing around and you act like it's fuckint Hitler blowing up on twitch.
---
I would say a *siginificant* chunk definitely have a personal dislike for the streamers because of this. Threads celebrating raids of people going all antifa on streamers and try to bully them by constantly attacking them hoping to ruin their streams. I would expect this sub to mostly be adults, but a large slice of this community seems to be super immature.
---
Goody Goody yum yum

Whitemane evidently has 4chan.

2. Dumptruck
---
3. Sosa
---
I'm a warrior main tank
---
Accurate. As long as you don't keyboard turn then gear will win VS skill
---
That was unnecessary coarse. No wonder you don't care too much about the social side of the game if you spontaneously react like that.
---
So does "Zigzag"
---
What is wrong with going arms ... Is anyone actually leveling as fury after level 40?

There I was thinking I'm streamer-free by playing on the EU RPPVP realm......
---
I don't even know what a zoomer is XD
---
He’s deleting it soon anyway. He said he’d give me Slavery for my birthday today.. but I think I’m good.
---
Wow, fuck Herod being the ‘authentic experience’. after all. Fuck I hate streamers.
---
I'm curious, what data are you talking about?
---
The Human Spirit :\^)
---
Only applies to PvP servers now
---
On **Shazzrah (EU)** I have the name **Icecube**, if anyone are interested in buying/trading
---
And the word is 'mam' anyway.
---
Survival isn't "melee hunter."
---
This streamer doesn't have a cult following him around and his fans aren't edgy and idiots like assmanbald.
---
Ok which one of you took PlayerMDSFYN?
---
That's the one I wanted...
---
If the person who has "Sad" on Shazzrah is willing to trade for "Icing" I'd be so grateful. My name is Sadzeih but everyone calls me Sad.
---
I got my picks on Oceana, my og main, a Meatshield tank, and a Sheepinator mage, even could have got Huntard but really who plays hunters... jokes
---
Have you watched him? I used to think he was the worst thing ever, mostly due to his opening line but the truth is hes one of the best God damn entertainers on twitch
---
I think you could keyboard turn against a druid out of firm and be fine!
---
You can never go back to 2004 and relive it like that. 
---
I thought #nochange was about game mechanics and the adventure. Not about feeling like it's 2004. People already know more about vanilla than they knew in 2004-2007. So you can't take that away.
---
Also you should really play on a CRT monitor and see less pixels than everybody else if you want #nochange hardcore.
---
There was never a way to relive the experience like it was back then.
---
That's awesome. Thanks for the feedback!

---
Just an FYI, if you record 5 minutes then record another 5 minutes immediately after there will be like 5 second gap between the two videos because it doesnt start immediately capturing after saving a shadowplay
---
if I had to guess their hard cap is 2500-3000, which is the estimated cap for 2004/5 servers. IMO though, it should be at least 5000. In the 5000/6000 area, the server feels populated but not overcrowded, and finding groups is a breeze. Once you get down into the low 2000s and 1000s leveling zones are rather desolate (once the server is established) and finding a dungeon group for something like ulda becomes an absolute chore
---
Jesus fuck... and I though we were safe on EU servers.
---
I wanna see a comparison to the vanilla client
---
Daylin checking in, cant wait
---
Myspace yo!
---
Looking for Bowser on Shazzrah and Arno on Golemagg. Really important, please PM me
---
Anyone got the name Shampagne or Shampayne on Shazzrah? Would love to have one of those names again.
---
Same boat, I played Tauren in Vanilla. Honestly got tired of crappy camera angles in small dungeons. Gonna go Orc or Undead this time
---
When they start making money on Diablo Immortal and i mean a LOT of it, what do you think happens to their stock price ? And you cant just say the stock dropped because of immortals.
---
It was partially because they DIDNT announce Diablo 4. A big moneymaker.
---
My God this would be amazing
---
Per account.
---
I think this is the most obvious satire I have ever seen in a WoW context. How can you even attempt to attribute this to his actual personality?
---
Hang on, call for innervate on vent.
---
Grabbed Saidin for my Alt mage
---
Vanillaguide doesnt work and the addon joana is working on wont be rdy for launch
---
Hmm it seems like PVP Servers are most likely in Horde favour. 
---
Can anyone confirm this? Back in Vanilla we had 30min wait times for BG and I don't want this to happen again.
---
Lmao idd
---
No worries man, quite interested in seeing what you made back then - I tried looking up reference work before doing all this, but nothing really came up; this would be really cool to dig into!
---
Of course!
---
Well there’s a open chance they lock up Herod or the like for new character creation for a bit. Blizzard has done stuff like that before
---
survival is the best dps rading spec when in naxx gear btw. u put all points untll the 15% agility, skip last spec in SV and the rest in MM to get aimed shot.
---
with the rest of the alliance scum
---
I named my dwarf rogue Die
---
The launch will probably suck, but if you come back to play in 6 months when all the people who don't actually wanna play Classic leave, it will be better.
---
Was able to get 9 names (2 roomies were starting work early) it was so fun to have 3 computers with the classic login screen, reminds me of my all nighters at my local cybercafé :)
---
You mean stuff like changing boss mechanics or loot drops? Or new content for classic to have new things to explore?
---
So it was you!
---
Well, I don't care that much either, but remember that one such guild can have immense impact if they manage to really control Devilsaur. That is a huge economical monopoly, especially in Phase 1. The ganking part I couldn't care less about.
---
As for those "coalitions", I don't care much either. I mean, we only have 2 PvP EN realms - even if literally no one would try to organize it means half of each country would end up on your realm. No matter what you get a lot of people from the same country, and a lot of them will not be super fluent English speakers. If anything, it seems pretty good now. Shazzrah get Spaniards, but also Scandinavian and England to balance it. France and German got their own realms. It's not like ending up on a realm with only countries that are great English would ever be an option with 2 realms, coalitions or not.
---
Sitting on the shitter listening to Triad and reading wow reddit. Noice name

Weekend of the wow release is going to be awesome. Tool and Wow, its like 2006 all over again
---
Medium sized WoW streamer and YouTuber
---
Were you at a Brisbane Internet cafe today?
---
I didnt even know I could reserve my name. Good thing no one wants it.
---
Good choice. I was trying to decide between Parabola or Stinkfist after I found my usual name was taken. Went Stinkfist in the end.
---
We have worked quite hard to replicate this, and as far as I am aware it hasn't been able to replicated. I know people who use FF for the subreddit and it works just fine.
---
Having said that, we _are_ still looking into it. For now you can either:
---
1) Turn off CSS on the subreddit.
---
2) Use an extension like HTML content blocker and block the image itself (https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TTK-d2pVXRYlIS6rrJcgPYkRUb6CyT0Oihvqhlu6pCw.png) from loading on this webpage.
---
Either should work to prevent the issues until we can actually replicate it!
---
I thought you were joking when I read this
---
I have that name on Live (unfortunately :(
---
What are you in a rush for? The first week won't matter 6 months from now.
---
The Queues were Long - but they didn't take Long.
---
8000 People took around 5-10min when the Servers are actually playable.
---
The layers are activating as People log-in I guess. This takes a Little bit of time - but a Queue of 8000 is not that bad - it just Looks bad ;)
---
They got it all under control. I mean they have to... They do this for Ages now and have millions of Players . I think they got it
---
His face is so punchable
---
If you are speedrunning from launch you will outlevel the opposite faction in short order.
---
However if you are just talking about fast levelling then decide if you prefer pve. For pvp I guarantee not only will there be murder during levelling, but for raiding at 60 as well.
---
Relatabe.
---
Rp-pvp servers are typically ghost towns after a while as the rpers dont like getting their events griefed and the pvpers look for better teams/enemies elsewhere. This is I think the first time we’ve launched with an rp pvp server. So, something might change. We’ll see
---
Is it kelduril?
---
It's coming, wont be done for a few months though, at least that's what he answers every 15 minutes when someone asks this question in his stream.

Yesterday night was not a random "two weeks before release at midnight in the middle of the week". It was "the one single point in all of the lifetime of classic WoW where you get the most added benefit out of logging in that exact second".
---
You won't see that many people logging in at one single time ever again, apart from probably the launch day, where the people who didn't resub for the character creation will try to snatch up whatever "good" names are left.
---
I stayed up until the character creation opened. I won't stay up to start playing at midnight in two weeks. I might not even play for a few days. Yes, there will be more players joining in two weeks. No, we don't even know what "low" and "high" means in terms of accounts or characters. Neither do we know how many people logged in yesterday night that play retail and just wanted to reserve a name, or how many players will be left 3 months after release.
---
Saying Blizzard was right (or wrong) about the server amounts because of what we know, is silly. But so is calling yesterday nights event a random "two weeks before release in the middle of the night".
---
I'd say if people stopped interpreting random things to fit their agenda (that goes for you AND the OP), that would be great.
---
Where can i see this coalition of guilds?
---
Looking for the name Dice on Golemagg... Really attached to the name. Please pm me if you managed to grab it! We'll work something out
---
You get three warnings, first time you pull instead of the tank I ask nicely. Second time I insist you let them gain aggro. Third time I only use rez on you for the rest of the dungeon and if you say anything you're not in the dungeon anymore.
---
Me neither, just pointing that out
---
damn, thats too bad
---
I like the few Underwatch aswell
---
too bad, thx for the info
---
Fuck, almost makes me want to delete one of my chars on the offchance it isn't taken.
---
ive been hacked
---
Yo, who has Earthmonk on Shazzrah? I had that name for my shammy for ages :(
---
Thats ok. I like that, so i can avoid those kind of people.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. People call us boomers but when I trade an item to a guy and he says "Pogchamp" I just cringe honestly.
---
WTB Cloud on Faerlina. Will "trade" a LOT.
---
Lf Foxx on Herod for a friend.
---
Wait, Lewis is there twice? Can you have the same names on both horde and alliance or what's up with that?

I just heard Taiwan also have Classic servers, but like Korea and China it's a different company who manage it and who need Taiwanese ID, licence etc.. , no better chance to migrate it to EU server later.

I spent hours going through all my old names, my new names, names I've not considered before... None available... I thought, Gary. Yeah, Gary... Nope, not even Gary available :/ Pleased I got my first choice Paladin and Hunter names, even if I didn't get my warrior one. I now have to reevaluate if I can play such a foreign-sounding warrior
---
I think 1 thread where everyone can trade their names and such would be cool, I know my guild master did get his shamans name which he’s had since vanilla, he’s offering a million gold on retail for the name and even giving the person who can find the person with the name and talk to them 300k
---
I don't blame him for posting this at that time. The industry was in the gutter nothing but AAA games filled with microtransactions. I do think some of the shit he's say's is entitled bullshit though but thats to be expected of most humans when they have atleast 10k plus people treat u as a celebrity.
---
I got the email that this name reservation thing is taking place at 12:00 at 12:30 so i did not even have the chance to get my name
---
Hahahah
---
What next? Are you going to blacklist people who made a video from the gameplay? I mean someone might SEE it. After that I suppose you ban the people who take screencaps? I mean they might get a LIKE for it.

I do wish you keep on going. This stuff is amazing to watch ^^ You are going to end up more coo coo than Asmonds chat.

They already stated that a layer will be able to fit around 2500-3000 players and each server will have a multitude of layers. I imagine there are at least 10 layers per server.

I'm sure mine will be gone but I don't think it'd suit the charts yet I'm going to make anyway. I'm sure one of my many names will be available. 
---
Also I'm in Europe so the chances go up.
---
A ahit ton of large scale community events
---
also in bg pvp surv is better than MM. 30SV / 21MM
---
Wait, so this is NOT William Shatner?
---
No nose piercing?
---
When I saw the server as an option my champion started to arise in a big way
---
True, but it seems that [at least in Europe](https://ibb.co/jwmqw85) most will try out PvP.
---
I wonder if another PvP server will be added in Europe with stats like that right now.
---
All classes are fun in classic! Pick one you like the idea of and just run with it! 
---
Classic is a marathon not a sprint anyway so you can always change later :)
---
This is my question. I know a lot of people who didn't bother logging in to reserve a name so there'll be even more at launch. The thing is at launch people won't only be logging in for a few mins to reserve a name, they'll be logging in for an hour+
---
u do realize its a game from 2004 right
---
WTT: Lie, Icy, End, Fly on Bloodsail Buccaneers

---
What.. I tried to call myself Healbot but it wouldn't allow me. And you made this 2 hours after name reservation?
---
It's a theory that's been kicked around for a while by youtubers and such, but Classic+ and the next xpac could line up nicely.
---
I ran the for-fun guild 'Exalted with your mom' back in TBC...we were alive for about a month.
---
No we wouldn't.
---
Lol im looking for cross on Shazz, but it got snagged right under my cheek
---
Generic names are where it's at, I named mine Arthur and Lancelot, Undead though so probably going Warrior on both.
---
Same still got a bottle of each.
---
Me too. Should be everyone's.
---
Good luck to you and your guild and thanks a lot for the info!
---
Someone took my real name, my last name, my middle name, and my fucking initials some how what the actual fuck
---
I live in the US for half the year and I get about 100-200ms on EU servers, it's barely noticeable. You need an EU account for EU servers or a NA account for NA servers though.
---
Same in EU. Shazzrah switched me to Mirage Raceway. :/
---
I don't like him much either, but that was all pretty obviously a joke.  People still sub with their prime to play into it, but it's whatever.
---
Nice breasts. Are they real?
---
I took the pic on my phone lol. It’s not a pc screen shot
---
Druid is the best healer in world pvp, because of stealth. Pop out, toss some heals. If they focus you, run away, if they focus your team just heal. Very hard thing to deal with in classic.
---
I kept getting DC'd when clicking accept on the create char screen, and then once it all calmed down I got stuck on 'retrieving character list' and they all appeared.
---
Layering get deleted and there is no Sharding or Phasing in Classic so we are pretty safe :)
---
I have an issue with most of the Dwarf faces lol
---
Looking for "Kahless" on Lucifron. Please, my friend needs it so we can play as 3 Klingons.
---
Thanks :D
---
I’m more willing to bet that it’s people logging out within minutes after getting their names rather than layering.
---
Karma hotel?

Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a paid service like race swap or support ticket?

shazzrah had a 20k+ queue moron. god americans are fucking stupid. imagine being american.
---
I've always been fan of coca cola and such. But when i first tasted mountain dew, Holy fuck that shit tastes like poison.
---
I wasn't allowed Hitchcock..
---
This name was the *single* reason I was contemplating renewing my subscription for the name reservation.
---
Unfortunately I do no have Cross on Shazz
---
The equivalent for paladin is [Holy Mightstone](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20620/holy-mightstone)
---
Perfect analogy
---
Yes please. There was a 12k+ queue for name reservation on Shazz last night. It'll be insanity with only two servers.
---
&gt;Losing? How?
---
Because blizz will delete 2 of them as soon as people report you
---
I propably would have gone for Nero or Zeus but even if i tried those are hard to get.
---
I live in the east coast and play in EU. 90ms, perfectly playable. Raided mythic uldir without a problem
---
I got Lygma and my buddy got Bawls. We plan to level together :) 
---
Also go Zangataz which was the name of my vanilla imp. Plus Scuzzlebutt from South Park. Pretty happy.
---
Well in Name Reservation it probably wasn't layers coming into effect. That should happen as you login to your character.
---
Although I feel more Servers would have been a smarter idea too as I don't think we loose as much Population as Blizzard estimates - we will all be able to Play.
---
I just hope layering will be removed fast (like promised) and they rather open a new Server with free Transfers than extending layern unneccesarily
---
Welcome to the tribe!
---
You get three warnings. First time someone dies, I ask nicely. Second time, I insist you pay attention. Third time, we start using CC and only kill one mob at a time, only breaking the CC when everyone is at full HP and if you say anything, you’re not in the dungeon anymore and we find a new healer.
---
LF Tyrion or Tirion on Whitemane
---
Not all that hard to fix if that's ever a big issue, create a new server open up free transfers to it, call it a day.
---
Nudes is going to get flagged and forced to namechange, just fyi.
---
Legion and BfA launches were pretty damn smooth as I recall, at least in Europe.
---
yeah this means nothing and still there are ppl not care about names and haven't touch the sub button
---
You must have pissed off the wrong Blizz employee lurking here
---
My friend wanted this so bad on shazzrah. Well played
---
Dutchy  :D
---
Some things to consider: if a dps pulls adds, the dps is the shitter. If a dps pulls aggro from the tank, the tank could be the shitter but the dps is still a shitter for not managing their aggro properly. If the tank dies while the healer has mana and they're the first to die, the healer is a shitter.
---

 I just found out that the word **thief** is not allowed in character names. Now I'm wondering when did this happen as I used to have a rogue in  vanilla wow named Thieflegend.
---
When did Jedi become a name that contains mature language?
---
Well I was in an 11k queue for Shazzrah last  night just to reserve a name.. 
---
Make of that what you will.
---
There is no calming you down. "servers" are like clustergroups where layers are the "real" servers.
---
Damn, that's sick dude.
---
i think when vanilla came out they spun up a fuckload of servers fir the first few years.
---
i guess phasing is just a way to reduce the numbers of servers they need to spin up.
---
like we do know first 2 weeks to a month there will be a hell of a lot more players than there will be 3 months in, i just think blizz is betting on the game being basically a flop.
---
i actually think the game plan is , give them 20 servers , see how it goes , if classic fails and retail gets 5% more players they would be happy with that.
---
they are prob more focused on making some good retail content expecting classic to fail and retail to swing in and pickup as many players as possible.
---
i personally wont be logging into retail again but i thing there is a good chance thats the game plan
---
if they expect it to be unpopular they dont want to spin up 20 too many servers and be stuck keeping them up for several years.
---
Love him, hate him, you gotta respect the trolling. Top Tier.
---
This might seem basic but looking for Alex on any English EU realm.
---
If they didn't require an active sub, there would be nothing stopping people from creating additional bnet accounts and reserving dozens of names.  Anyone that waited until launch would have nothing at all to choose from.
---
Hey, worked through the client. Thanks mate.
---
I had a char for a bit named vhergeinor. Nobody understood it until my friend made a char named pooncheeks and we started world pvping.
---
Good thing I make my own groups with friends and pug dps.

How would layering have helped relieve queues during name reservation? Layer the character creation screen?
---
np dude, enjoy!
---
Card? I tried paypal instead and it worked
---
Yeah 0 chance layerings gone after phase 1.
---
They already said it was continent wide, yet there are videos of people layering between zones and entering cities.
---
This means it will be impossible to forge communities as you won't recognise anyone.
---

Had a queue of over 10k to log in and make characters; can’t wait!
---
&gt;  i was looking forward to playing a Night Elf Mohawk
---
You could play a Night Elf, but he would never have a Mohawk.
---
why would anyone wait until launch if they could get it for free today?
---
&gt;  and compete at end-game depending on the encounter
---
We talking about Grobbulus or Nurgle?
---
Thought that was super moldy bread on your desk at first.
---
Such a good name, perfect for a gnome.
---
I got Hircine, Daedric prince of the hunt. Also Malacath for my orc warrior naturally.
---
Some will quit but a lot will also settle into a more chill play time.
---
A lot of people are poopsocking the first weekoffer example, seven of my friends got time off work for it. We'll be playing significantly less after that and so will most people once the initial launch excitement dies down. 
---
Concurrent players is the big problem they're solving with layering.
---
Server merges are an absolute shitshow in comparison to layering, we've lived through those and everyone hated it.
---
I really didn't expect to, especially after having to sit in a queue, but I lucked out and got Abra on Shazzrah.
---
didn't even know he was on EU servers.

Thanks for the reply.
---
&gt; Not money from an infrastructure or technological standpoint. Money from a CS standpoint. The department they cut by like 60% last year.
---
I don't see how this would be a thing since even the things you mention in your reply would be automated.
---
&gt; Also, if your only solution to over/underpopulated servers is the same method used 15 years ago, I’d argue you’re not very forward thinking on this matter. There are numerous other way blizzard could either funnel players or deal with ghost towns.
---
Like what?  Maybe you're thinking a slow-roll merge where you combine two realms as an interim solution until you eventually merge them?  I suppose but this looks like a great deal more work and development time but since they have layering, they can skip this step entirely.
---
&gt; The issue is they don’t think many people will stay. They believe 85% of the classic population will be short term tourists. They truly are so out of touch that they actually believe retail is a good mmo. It’s a fucking single player transmog game.
---
I think they may be underestimating at the same time the player base is overestimating.  I don't think the current retail player is the type of player that Classic would be catering to but since they have a sub to retail, they'll play around in cWoW - a tourist.  Nostalgia will also only get you so far, the idea of playing cWoW again is at fever pitch but we all should know by now that nastalgia wanes quickly.
---
&gt; So although there’s speculation, don’t act like this was the only option. It wasn’t. At all.
---
I didn't say it was.  I said that I believed it was the best solution given the circumstances.  Time will tell.
---
Never turned green so had to restart, then after logging in and selecting realm it was locked. Then placed me in 8k queue. Leeroy was gone :(
---
Still saving it for a special occasion.

Yes I’m sure.

Im pretty sure you don't have "Portal" on Shazzrah. Im not planning on parting with the name.
---
I mean they legitimately got outclicked. Any launch event like this comes down to how fast you click, internet connection, and a little bit of luck. Its not that he missed out on the name because he couldnt log in. He missed out because someone beat him to it. Then he blamed it on Blizzard.
---
You forgot about gen y.

I've never watched a streamer in my life and have no real dog in this fight, but from everything I've seen from you on this sub, you have been a class act. I appreciate that.

I got my 2 letter name on whitemane and fairbanks because I couldn’t decide on one. Is fairbanks really low population? I might go with that if it means less crowds and layering

Anyone got Anny or Alma on shazz and dont need them? PM for unconditional hugs

You got me worong. I like those interactions, i just never attack people first, without a reason. The whole red-is-dead logic breaks the idea for player interaction that is so loved in classic. I prefer to have reason and emotion to kill/camp somebody :) otherwise it's like just killing another mob..

IF you think about it, they are already MAKING that money off the name trading. Because trading with tokens seems to be fine in their books, offering straight up real money might not be.

no, you are talking about Silesia, which was heavy influenced and immigrated by germans because of the mines there. when german invaded it, it just manifested more german influence and culture in that area. Thats why the local accent in Silesia is an interesting mix of german and polish words. That did not went away when the area was given back to poland, and workers coming from the rest of poland were looked down upon, especially those from warsaw (fuck those guys , as my granddad always said)
---
Source: Grand Grand Grandfather immigrated to Silesia to work in the mines.
---
They lied! They took our emotions and screwed them into a ball! I don't have anxiety. I do now!  
---
I may resort to god. (The old gods ofc).
---
They can add more servers though if player numbers are still high two months from now. Merging servers is much more difficult and pisses players off way more than layering.
---
&gt; Its the standard go-to tactic for drakkisath
---
Will that work on Retail, though? On Lightshope I was kiting him all the way to the Beast's chamber, but that seems off. 
---
&gt;majordomo
---
Sure. But we were talking dungeons...
---
Maybe.... I want to believe this. I truly do.
---
Blizzard at this point is purely motivated by money. If they start to do things you don't like, then put your money where your mouth is and UNSUB.
---
It's the only way to get what you want from them. 
---
The reverse is also true, if they're doing a great job then chuck money at them. They are very predictable in this regard and we can use it to our advantage.
---
This is a great question, I think it’s not clearly worded on the tooltip
---
I’m obviously talking about situations where someone says, “hey invite my friend ‘such and such’” and they have no way of right clicking them.

Cool name. Congrats.

You've got it wrong dude, I'm the winner here I have my pick of good players to take to dungeons because good players want to play with other good players not kids who think  zf should be treated like naxx.

---
Yepp, in BC the system was the same but expanded with new talents, in WotLK the system was the same but to combat broken hybrid specs they made it so that you had to get the last talent in one of the trees before you could branch out, and in Cata they expanded on WotLK's system again.
---
After that it died.
---
Leveling probably paladin warlock or mage. Pala and warlock have a free mount, mage doesn’t need food. Pala wears expensive armor to repair and drinks a lot, locks have to train their pets. Mage ports typically pay for themselves in flight costs/selling portals.
---
Hunter damage doesn't fall in later raids compared to other to DPS, it gets better, Hunters damage in raids it's at its worst in Molten Core and scales better the later you go and is at it's best in Naxxramas.

It really feels like it is going to be extremely crowded.
---
Just the scandinavian guildes that said they would go on Shazzrah is like 50+ guilds. Then UK and half the spanish people also going there.
---
I got in a 5k queue after ~15 seconds from servers went up. I think it was like 10k queue after 15-30 min, a lot of people that went on there.
---
Of course it will be, that's why you never play on launch day.
---
You: "im oom"
---
They: "yes... we know your name is oom, you told us a million times already"
---
Yeah. I guess that's better than dead servers.
---
The thing with Layers is that they work as smaller servers. Let's say each layer has 3K players. I can dig that. The world won't feel dead. Just let me play with friends/put my guildies in the same layer tho.
---
That's what you get when you intend to use your streamer identity name ingame. Just pick something else that you like or have a recognisable prefix or suffix, the followers will learn who the particular character is on the first day anyway since it will be streamed! Smh

 I was planing to go Alliance on this server. Worried now that it might suck. Just want a normal server.
---
lets be honest spite should take up more space..
---
...And after that, you finally land on your realm of choice, and all seemingly unique names you've used for years were taken.
---
They were queue for German and French realms. I don't think they overestimated this population, but should add 1 or 2 servers for EU PVP.

---
But /u/justdrop reminded me it could be done through the client, so I loaded up enough a month's subscription and now I'm ready for 27.08! :)
---
If they really knew better than us, they wouldn't have changed the number definitions for low/medium/high pop servers around \~20 minutes into the name reservation. Both EU PvP servers were labeled High while the Normals were Medium after only \~15 minutes, shortly after which they were changed.  
---
    
---
For sure this is a learning experience, but that's also okay. They're not omnipotent or somehow smarter than their players though, like OP is making them out to be.
---
&gt; Should be noted that you will get some hit naturally from items that are BiS even with SV,
---
Yes but you can exchange some Hit pieces for Crit and AP, which will be a decent DPS boost.
---
&gt;Even so, I've never seen any actual proof (aside from obviously wrong math) that SV is better at 450 agility,
---
I've seen calculations, the difference isn't big at 400-450 base agi, but that agi is not the max you can get, and the calculations never accounted for the fact that you could have:
---
- Trueshot Aura ( as SV )
---
- A Shaman doing Agi Totem

Well I’m with you there man. I’m not tryna prove a point or anything. Just trying to state that a lot of people want to avoid them to maximize their classic experience. I don’t hate them, I just wanna avoid them, you feel me.
---
No you see 2. RPPVP isn't just a PvP server, they have rules and no doubt they will be inforced one way or another.
---
Good on you for choosing the superior faction, you're already a natural at this!  Class is of course a huge question that ultimately only you can answer.  I saw in another comment that you're learning tauren shaman.  I'm actually going tauren shaman as well, so obviously I'm a bit biased.  I really like that shamans can passably do every role while leveling and then at endgame can do well healing in raids amd blowing people up in PVP with a single spec and gear set.  
---
The other suggestion I'd make for a first character might be a little surprising, but druids can be a lot of fun once you've figured it out.  They're especially complex for new players because they have some unique mechanics, but I learned the game as a druid and found that picking up any other class was pretty easy after that.  Shamans are close, but druids are the real jack of all trades.  With a single spec you can tank, dps, and heal all the way to 60, and with some research and dedication you can still do any of those things after 60.  
---
In PVP you have stealth, you can prevent others from stealthing, you've got roots, stuns, instant self heals, mid-combat rez, and escapes for days (which also means nobody else can escape from you).  Druid is pretty dope.  I'd say pick whichever class the Earth Mother tells you to.  
---
I'm going herb/alch for professions, because I apparently like to play classes with mana problems so I gotta cover that with some homebrew mana potions.  Haokah on Mankrik if you need a hand with anything at release!

There will be ;)

**Killing of Harambe**
---
On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe. A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.

I logged. Waited a bit for the realms to open. Sat on logging a bit. Ended up on wrong server but relogged. Got into the queue at 10k and was on the car screen after 5 minutes. None of my names were available but whatever.

I thought it worked pretty decently all in all. I guess I could whine and go crazy for Blizzard wasting five minutes of my life and generelly just be a whiny child on reddit who didnt get to eat his cake. But whats the point.

---
There are more than 2 servers.
---
Can I join even if I don't rp? Like I could pretend to rp, but could i still talk normal in dungeons/raid chat? Will there be other people that talk normal? Are there ever nonrp or rp-lite guilds on these servers.
---
I honestly feel like normal pvp realms are going to be overstuffed and then desolate whereas I could see RP realms being much more healthy from launch to whenever.
---
Anyone get "Chad" on Zandalar Tribe? I got kicked out of the game before I could get it...

Missing at all is painful as arms. You won't do as much dps with arms as you would fury but you spike harder. Better to swing more often.

---
I doubt RP-PVP will die, because it's a needed server albeit a niche one. Yeah, it won't have as many players as the top PvP server - but that was never the case anyway. The way I see it it's a higher liklihood that one of the normal servers disappear than the RP-PVP for two reasons, there's more than one Normal server unlike RP-PVP and thus a merge can happen, people who only wants to play two months and then leave will probably choose a PvP or normal server over a RP-PVP thus creating a more fluctuating populaton. The RP-PVP might be a small community but it tends to attract individuals who stick around, at least that's my experience from vanilla to wrath. I don't regret rolling on the RP-PVP.
---
Only thing pathetic here is your mindset towards something you obviously have no understanding of.
---
Meanwhile me on Hydraxian Waterlords. 🙁
---
But there is no data yet of when its open to play? So why would he be talking about that. It theres one thing that is certain, it will be that this name reservation is a fraction of the amount we will see on launch.
---
- Many people didn't feel like subbing early just for a name reservation
---
- Many people didn't have time to be online on 00:00 CET
---
Talking for Europe obviously. But both English PvP servers were on High pop for over an hour.
---
This is only the organised people. I'm sure casuals are going to even out servers a little bit. Probably not completely even queue times, but they definitely will both have queues. And if not... i'm afraid it will never become the vanilla experience.

I'm moving to Korea next year from the UK and I've been thinking about which server to play classic on after I move. I only speak a little bit of Korean so I was wondering if you recommend I play on the Korean server or maybe one of the west coast NA servers/OCE servers?

Agreed.  Barrens chat was just as trolly during the stress test as it was when I went through it in 2004.  It's just different topics.  The real issue isn't the chat, it's the inability for people to take 2 seconds to either leave the chat or ignore the offending chatters; instead they bitch and complain about them in the same channel which just intensifies the annoying chatter.

Why are you giving these guys so much credit? They have nothing to do with the popularity of the game nor will they have any influence on the servers as soon as they stabilize.

I think blizzard has 15 years of managing a game called World of Warcraft and multiple expansion and major patch launches.
---
Wow great catches, would be the perfect names for husband and wife duo
---
All these theories that most will stop playing vanilla wow after a month or two and all I can think about is how players have happily played it for over a decade now. Obviously a good bunch will decide it’s not for them, and that’s fair, but I don’t think it’s half as many as you think. Games fun- nostalgia etc aside.

Layering means x amount of people are split into x amount of 'layers'.  Each time you log in, swap zones, join a group you can be moved to a different layer.  
---
Classic wow was successful because you were always with the same players. You always saw the same guilds and the same faces in dungeons. Layering destroys this.

Besides money... what would be the "pro" here?
---
A bunch of people reserve names that ultimately don't plan on playing?????
---
Uhh yeah, because people left the server and freed their spot up instantly for someone else. When the game launches they’re going to keep their spot...
---
Whatever. I'm just fucking tired today and didn't get my 2-3 characters long names :(
---
My friend reserved My name. But someone took it in the three seconds between him deleting his char and me clicking create.
---
„all the best names” lol
---
Good answer
---
Implying that as a healer you would be leading parties.
---
Here is how it goes in reality: Tank has lead, he wants the dungeon to go fast (and because hes a toxic male warrior of course) so he keeps pulling even when you're low on mana, if you cant keep up with him managing your mana and drink times and start to complain or stop healing, YOU will be the one that gets kicked and replaced by a healer who wont waste a single second drinking between pulls.
---
That's what I just said.
---
You mean you don't want your birth name as your fantastical character's name?
---
Jokes on you, I don't have any names to reserve.
---
I see what you mean, yea that sounds like it sucks. I only found out about Classic WoW being released today.
---
While I really would like to go back, I know me and I know that I dont have enough time to get addicted to this world again
---
Plenty. Best batsmen, bowlers, strategy, predictions, tactics, history, statistics, etc etc. It's an extremely complex and involving game.

---
Yeah, as in, not Légólás or Íllídán.
---
Only spark of light in Blizzard behavior could be their intention to avoid griefing.
---
The world is full of retards who like to see the world burn and could create characters just to steal cool names that will be lost forever.

With the subscription wall Blizzard can stop them

"As for people reserving their name who've never played WoW or who won't play Classic but are trolling, they could've easily avoided it by restricting access only to people who have either played WoW before and bought game time, or who spent xy+$ in battle net shop before so that people can't make troll accounts."

To be fair of course there was going to be a que in the first few minutes as most people were trying to log in right away to reserve their names. A day or two after launch people will be more spread out instead of everyone trying to log in at the exact same time.
---
That's not to say there won't be a lot of people, but we can't say for sure how bad ques are going to be.
---
its amazing that in the year of our lord 2019 so many people still dont know how to take screenshots

Friend will be warrior. I will be priest.
---
&gt; Here is how it goes in reality:
---
You are wrong and I am right.
---
Those "statuses" reflect how many that are creating their characters on the servers at the moment. So no, they are not the actual statuses that we're going to see on launch, but they are a very good indicator of how it will be since it shows the general interest the different servers have. That and the server queues that were present after the first 10 seconds of the name reservation will roughly reflect how big the queues will be on launch after the first minute or two.
---
Don't forget that launch will have even more people logging in then the first minute of a name reservation where not everyone that will play on launch were present.
---
How?  
---
I plan to do skinning and get gold from vendoring the mats, but that obviously won't make me rich, never been great at making money.
---
As for people reserving their name who've never played WoW or who won't play Classic but are trolling, they could've easily avoided it by restricting access only to people who have either played WoW before and bought game time, or who spent xy+$ in battle net shop before so that people can't make troll accounts.
---
My opinion on how to solve that problem
---
This might come as a shock to you but saying „don’t believe me?“ and then just following it up with random rambling about supposed achievements and a relationship to some guy from nihilum doesn’t exactly equal „proof“
---
Impressive
---
Not sure if you played WoD at the launch but it was unplayable for many people, sometimes for all. And I would say classic is more than another expansion.
---
Unrelated but the new Tolkien movie is really good. It's well worth a watch if you're curious about his early life and where a lot of his ideas came from.
---
Dog names
---
Yeah, both dumb ideas to a game that requires a sub to play.
---
Fair enough - but my point remains. Don't believe them... Yet. you agree?
---
LF Shiro on Whitemane
---
Believe it or not, but accented characters are actually used in languages. If you got the name you wanted, why would you half-ass it and skip adding an accent, making it pronounced completely differently?
---
Simply geologist? That's an awesome job.
---
So unoriginal you mean?
---
Way to solve the issue!
---
I played both a warrior and a hunter in Vanilla.
---
I actually rerolled the hunter because the warrior was super-frustrating to play in BGs as a fresh 60.
---
The hunter had always been fun and felt usefull even with shitty gear. Mainly because you don't have to commit to a fight. You just send your pet on people who aren't even in range and then shoot at them from max-range. And if someone dangerous-looking comes too close you can start running away.
---
As a warrior you have to commit and once you charge in, there's usually no way out. Either they die or you. And with crappy gear and no healers backing you up, it's usually you.
---
Since I really hate dying I mostly just stayed back and was useless. So for my playstyle Warrior is a super-bad choice.
---
I'll be rolling resto-druid btw. As a healer I can be usefull for my team while staying away from danger and as a druid I have the best tools to get myself out of dangerous situations.
---
Tl;dr
---
Go Hunter! You'd probably regret warrior same as I did back then.
---
No need to swear and that EXCATLY is the point.
---
I don't want to play on the same server as them which is why I have a Herod character.
---
Which is WHY people were angry that Asmon was considering rolling on Herod.
---
Irrelevant - they aren't the only company trying to make as much money as possible every quarter...
---
Or because that's how it's spelled
---
Clap clap. Hurra. Skål!
---
2) didn't help
---
1) helped. Thanks. For my taste the experience is now a bit *too* classic, but better than freezing my whole browser :D
---
Nice of you to explain your opinion
---
I always enjoyed seeing a queue of \~2000 when I was login in in Vanillia - I don't know why but if log into Classic on day 1 and there is no queue I will be a little upset.
---
Doubt you’d want the name Favorite or Nickie on Herod?
---
This is true, and I would be night elf.
---
Shadowmeld has some serious cheese uses 😂
---
My friend played warrior while I played a paladin. I helped him with a lot of his class quests he would’ve other wise not been able to do at the time. His weapon from level 30, I recall taking him til about 35 to get. Was also difficult to find some extra help to kill the elite at the end.
---
The warrior quite frankly gives me cold feet for the beginning of the game.
---
Sorry for necroing the comment a bit, but do you mind explaining what you mean by this?
---
That's disgusting
---
Oh for sure. My buddy is rolling hunter. Had a total blast on the stress test with one. Just be mindful of the dead zone. 
---
Rogues have sooo many fun builds for pvp. I’m going to make one my alt this time around. Rolling mage as the main.
---
I think it is good that it costs money, in lol and poe to some extent it is not uncommon for bots to grab soooo many names, and with wow being free(or no base game needed) how would you otherwise stop people from running bots and reserving sooo many names?
---
You're right haha
---
And BFA had some servers down for a whole day... so what?
---
People act as if blizzard is clueless to how many people are going to TRY classic instead of actually play.
---
I can almost agree with that for US servers, but certainly not in EU. 
---
Since the English servers are home to basically all of Europe, letting people use accented characters makes sense, especially as many of these characters are actually on various EU layout keyboards.
---
Lok’tar Ogar!!!
---
Same happened to me :(
---
i honestly though grobuluus would have atleast been medium. kinda dissapointed
---
My OCD can't handle that after all these years the server population column is still sorted alphabetically instead of "high-medium-low" (or reversed)
---
Yeah but remember that they also want our money lol
---
My husband was able to grab Popular, Pleasure, and Nurture as well. I’d say we did alright!
---
These teenagers are too annoying. They can't stop jerking off Asmon at all times.
---
Dying servers will likely be migrated into other servers. Blizzard said they'd like to avoid this which is why they're going to layer. But Blizzard also said they didn't want to merge servers back in TBC but they eventually did it anyways.
---
oof this is hella uninformed
---
69
---
Maybe you should just come up with unique names?
---
lol, yeah lets ignore the content that most players play, clearly one should only spec for raids even if you're not even in a guild or raiding at all xd!
---
The same goes for DPS.
---
I have seen more DPS players (due to the 1/1/3 spread) being obnoxious fucks than I have seen Tanks or Healers combined, which is surprising if you consider how easy it is to replace them especially later on when tanks/healers get quite rare for +50 Dungeons.
---
Enjoy your time out there! I'm sure its gonna be a blast regardless of layering and whatnot. The nostalgia alone is gonna be insane
---
I dont get the pun? Someone explain please.
---
Dude if that isn’t fact. It’s go big or go home as a warrior lol.
---
My friend was a warrior, I was a pally... he had much success. Looking back I realize why. I also watched in duels as mages would rank 1 frost bolt troll him. His only real chance was if he got a TuF proc upon charge causing the mage to blink early.
---
#nochange It is a mix of everything it seems...
---
Pretty sure I have bottles of these laying around somewhere after all these years.   
---
I remember the good days when you looked at the WOTLK packaging and seeing that "14 MILLION PLAYERS AND GROWING" sticker and feeling like the game had such a bright future ahead of it....little did I know
---
There are plenty of people that already have an active subscription that got the chance to save their names to be ready for launch and for those that subscribed it’s probably a way to get them to try out BFA.
---
That’s what I would have done as well give something small to get new or returning customers to try out a new or existing product.
---
That was exactly the original plan. Just never made it into vanilla. As op stated above a portal is in SW for that very instance. I dont think there left over instance portals anywhere else though.
---
would prefer a guild hall myself, perhaps it could display things like Onyxia's head. Im very interested in how blizzard approaches the classic plus discussion or just chooses to reboot tbc/wotlk.
---
Yeah youd have to be high to use pidgey
---
How is that possible if you mind sharing? I'd love to reserve one more name but I can't get rid of the other ones I reserved... Thanks in advance &lt;3
---
That's what I was just doing. Luckily, I didn't lose my names in the process.
---
10 seconds is unnecessarily long. You can definitely cut that in half, at least. 
---
Know how you want to customize your character. Even if you already have your three names filled, you can still use Create-a-Character-- you just can't save it. You can also use this to practice customizing your character to shave off a couple seconds.
---
When you decide on the features you want, figure out how far away the feature you want is from the really obvious ones that you can essentially use as a landmark of sorts. [Wowhead's dressing room can help with this.](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room)
---
For example, female humans have 15 different faces. That's a lot to sift through when seconds count. The face I wanted is #3, and Angry Purple Eyes is #15 out of 15. Knowing this, I could spam click through the faces until I got to Angry Purple Eyes, and then I knew that the face I wanted was just three more clicks away.
---
Also all human except for the bloody priest. Classic classic
---
I'd say take it with a grain of salt.
---
For all we know they might open one more English PvP EU server after this.
---
If I see you in game I’m just going to assume you’re a good farming bot.
---
Yes you are right, hope you have a good time!
---
Because it ain't free, you need a sub to play the game. You will need a sub to grab a name on launch. What they have done is have people pay and waste two weeks of there sub so they can grab the name they want.
---
I didn't expect them to spin up all of their logon servers just for name reservations...did you?
---
Idk about Dav but I was after Dave and that shit was snapped up instantly
---
I already posted there as well, thanks.
---
It's less about him on realm play and more about the toxic cult following that shadows him in game
---
More like, raid spec will do just fine and Survival has shit damage
---
Baine's way better
---
For you
---
Yeah I was pretty surprised to see names I've been using for years across multiple realms already in use by someone else.  I guess when you take 50ish servers worth of people and funnel them into 10 or so suddenly names are at a premium.
---
Yeah but you forget that BfA is extra 50$.
---
I hope so dude! - i'll try take it with a pinch. ty
---
Tried that too, though I wasn't sure I was doing it right. It worked to cast the downranked spell on myself but not on anybody else (even when including [@mouseover] in the macro).
---
Either way, I'm sure it's an issue that'll come up when classic launches properly, so I guess I'll look into it again then.
---
WTB Khan or Czar on Shazzrah
---
PvE it is..
---
Those names really don't fit an RP server. Be prepared to get those reported and forced to change pretty quickly.
---
the classic launcher doesn’t even show up for me... yes I have game time and I’m opted in for the classic beta on my account page
---
But will you pay whoever took Grim on Grobuluus for the name?

I think it's fine. You don't have to do it but if you really want a specific name you get a chance by subscribing early. Letting everyone reserve names without having a subscription could lead to a lot of people reserving names that will never be used.

I just uninstalled BFA. I can't wait to finally get back to what I loved about WoW. I'll be casual, I won't progress far, but I'm here for the community, making friends and helping others. Long haul hype train, woo woo.
---
I do think the servers will die off A LOT but the concept of layering is really worrying. It's also incredibly strange. They refused to put in some QoL changes "for the authenticity of classic" yet, one of the if not THE most important things (community) is being threatened at least initially if not longer. There's literally not much point making friends in the beginning. Some will drop off, some will be moved, and the rest will be layered and never seen again lol
---
Damn, if you had gotten Farmer on Golemagg, I'd have loved that.
---
Price / Performance PC will be a lot better. Mind telling us what your budget is?
---
Why
---
Okay, but why would you raid spec if you are not raiding..? bruh
---
Not more than 800 USD
---
But my full-size keyboard always me to have my arms and hands are straight in front of me and parallel.
---
Are you female? Or &lt; 20?
---
Same :(
---
But they actually havnt made as much money as possible. Incase your unaware the last year or so hasn't been so hot. Personally looking for to next quarter results with all this new classic sub money.
---
I wished someone would have made that work for classic. I've tried AllyRoute but its absolutely inferior to VanillaGuide. In the end I stuck with GuideLime which is absolutely great and even automates a lot, but it currently only had guides up to lvl 30.
---
I chose Janus for mage and Vamana for a warrior. Pretty happy with those.
---
Some dude on the official forums straight up told everyone he was gonna reserve the name Thex for his shaman, resulting in all the posts and memes. He eventually got his name though due to some nice person trying to snag it for him

---
It's like Nazi symbolism and violence in Germany. It's on a case by case basis and decided by a committee, no real set of laws. Many companies self-censor *everything* that *might* hinder the release in advance, so the German version is usually more censored than it needs to be just to be safe.
---
Why do you have all that white in that screenshot?:S
---
You can spend ours just grinding gold, exploring the world, world PvP. Progression is much much slower too. So you don't finally get something only to have it be made pointless again the next week. Retail is far better if you want to see everything but if you just wanna keep chugging a long you can spend HOURS and HOURS of never ending content in classic.
---
I played Hunter in vanilla. I played BM, it’s not a great spec, but it very much suited how I liked to play the game.
---
I happily PvP-Ed all the way to rank 12, did Molten Core, BWL, AQ40 etc.
---
I wasn’t in a top guild, we would have probably been pushed to be in the top 50 guilds on the server (on a good day).
---
But I did:
---
Always turn up on time for the raid.
---
Always turn up with the correct flasks, potions and buff food.
---
I never ran out of arrows mid-raid
---
I was always helpful and pleasant on comms (being nice goes a long way)
---
I always had pre-read the tactic and knew what I needed to do.
---
Weirdly it turns out that middling dps from a sub-par spec from a middling class in 40 man raiding is absolutely fine. Not being someone who rolls their face on the keyboard from side to side and actually knows their rotation in a number of fights even gave me higher dps than a few of our more useless combat rogues (who have no excuses when playing swords combat)
---
TL;DR: play what you like, how you like it. Every spec of every class has at some point been raiding endgame and with a mature sensible pilot at the helm usually has done OK.
---
Nice dude! Good Rogue name. Best of luck man
---
Anyone get or know who got "kek" on arugal????
---
Queues for name reservation was intended? That's some 4D chess.
---
Yeah it's mandatory until you get to lvl 30 for the travel form. At least one point into feline swiftness.
---
That dead zone is a factor, I’m just trying to weigh it up. 
---
For me, it’s thinking about 1-59. High population, I expect loads of ganking, and limited loot... not to mention an early warriors severely limited grinding capabilities.
---
And only they are able to influence their success though right?
---
Not the consumers or the marketplace itself.
---
And we need another one in 7 days when blizzard realize EU distribution is completely fucked and needs to add 2-3 more PvP servers
---
Awww
---
Fuck Scandinavians or Germans, right?
---
That might explain why so many DPS have issues with their threat in the endgame.
---
"Let's rush this dungeon lol, It's just a 5-man. Who the fuck needs to learn about threat management? Not us"
---
That aside, people that have to mention how good they are at something tend to be the complete opposite...which means you are probably a terrible player.

&gt;Letting everyone reserve names without having a subscription could lead to a lot of people reserving names that will never be used.
---
My way of solving that problem
---
This ^
---
How did you "get" BfA for free with an active sub? Please explain, I would like to have it free as well
---
Not really sure, My best guess is the pop works like in retail. Even thw low pop realms probably have a lot of characters then
---
Damn! I should have spammed it.
---
Do rogue!
---
Where the f\*\*\* are you even? x') can't bother to find him if he do shit :&gt;
---
The streamers were saying it them self.
---
Shit names, enjoy your RP - PVP while I run around u with real names like, goku, vegeta and frieza.
---
Any way of reserving a name by phone? I'm unable to use a computer for 3 weeks
---
*Laughs in Oceania*
---
No, it's not. The difference is when the creator incited their audience, versous the audience doing it "for the creator" without them inciting it. I don't like Asmongold very well, but he has some solid points and policies every now and then.
---
Lazy paint job lol
---
Nope.
---
It is good to see 12 year olds will play this time, just like back in Vanilla. The new generation carries on the torch.
---
Humans can’t be hunters!
---
Not possible. You can´t create characters on different factions on PvP realm even now on character creation.
---
If you have absolutely no intentions of RP I would advise against joining an RP (pvp) server and join a PVP server. If you do decide to join and will not abide even by the simplest rules of RPing (no corpse camping and no nonstop lowbie ganking), then you're not a very nice person to put it lightly
---
I have, but I never felt good about it.
---
The 14 day wait is harder than the 6 month one :/

Another reporting in
---
Exactly. It's just ridiculous. At least I hope he learned something new, even if it doesn't seem like it.
---
No. You really shouldn't believe most of the things you read online, people are thick as fuck.
---
In an MMO things like this only work if everyone has to follow the same rules. You could LARP a project 60 in retail WoW but it isn't gonna be classic.
---
Btw I am not advocating for change, just discussing something I thought of
---
Not with a single account no.
---
God, that is hot
---
I don't think that leaving char/name reservations for free for everybody has any real advantage. From the begining I took it as something not needed and for 'them hardcores' (ofc it makes it a bit easier for Blizz to manage too, but...). I personally didn't wait for the opening to reserve me some chars nor did I pay a sub to do that... I'm thinking I will reserve one character a day or two before launch so I won't pay for not playing for 2 weeks. There is many more good names then players on each server so I'm not worried about not getting a good one even then. So my main point is blizzard isn't forcing us to pay in advance, they just made the opportunity for those who feel it's worth it... and they did it in a way that feels like good marketing strategy and still isn't unfair
---
UA isn't until TBC
---
RP people can’t kill anything lmao
---
I wanted Mercy for my healer. I guess that was probably expecting too much but I got really excited about it. Game decided to disconnect me while making character though.
---
Paris, or Amsterdam
---
Welk it was like 10 years ago, times be changing though.
---
i think kicked would be more fitting for the rogue
---
Because there are a lot of people who'll play Classic but don't want/can't pay 15$ 2 weeks earlier to reserve a name?
---
you cant.
---
I was a R8 on my paladin. I hated the pvp grind back then. Run in to every fight and auto attack. Look for an ally who needs some help (cleanse, BoP, BoF, stun a healer) it was just bland.
---
Playing a purely DPS class seems like it will be far better.
---
Yeah, it's sad, that the biggest releases from blizzard are wow classic and remasters of starcraft and warcraft 3.
---
And I'd say, they are in big trouble. retail wow, hearthstone, heroes of the storm. All of them are dropping players like crazy. Not sure about how Overwatch is doing.
---
I think a lot of loyalty to Blizzard. They've earned so much goodwill in the 90s and 2000s, that they can still feed on that. If they didn't have that brand power, I'd guess they would be bankrupt by now.
---
There wasn't a login server queue, but sure thing :)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if layering continues past phase 1 on any servers that are still overly populated. Guess time will tell.
---
You're missing Lyfe.

Tbh that's only one hot female forsaken face:D
---
Its al personal.  
---
You dont need addons to play the game.
---
Don’t you have Whitemane/Herod now?
---
Btw Shazzrah is obviously the right server.. No one in their right mind would look at the two pvp servers and think “oh Golemagg sounds swole, I’ll gonna rest my nuts here” Shazzrah has the superior name, and we have already unity since every nationality band together again the Spaniards. Already beautiful!
---
Too bad your on a shit server
---
Dude, I wonder what races Ox and bone are.
---
Are you 8?
---
I didn't "get" BfA for free, I just never bought it. Jesus.
---
So now all these people that reserved the name that they want can't have it with no warning and now have to deal with fighting for scraps on other servers? That would piss so many people off it wouldn't be funny.
---
It is me, meatscepter.
---
I've talked to people who don't care that they are gonna die and just want to cause as much havoc as they can.
---
For them Warrior might be a fine choice.
---
I like to immerse myself and play as if I really was there and as if death was permanent. Being strategical and only engage in battles where we have superior count. Always making sure there's a way to escape if things don't work out as anticipated.
---
That's how I in later add-ons on got the "Wreckingball" achievement (20 killingblows in one BG without dying) on several characters despite crappy gear... All ranged of course. The playstyle did not resemble a wreckingball at all. It was carefull positioning, only taking advantageous fights, using spells that have a high chance of getting the "lasthit" (Arcane-Missiles on a Mage and Shadowword:Death on Shadowpriest) and of course always running away whenever a situation looks dangerous.
---
To me not dying over the course of an entire BG while still having a good contribution to my teams success was the greatest feeling in WoW and is what I'm looking forward to experiencing again.
---
And I know that Warrior absolutely is not the class that could provide that feeling!
---
Ganking with a warrior.  
---
Good Luck
---
When you tried to log in to the server, there was no queue for you?  You're so lucky, you must have been so fast.
---
Happened to me, got in really early to the server, got my char ready, couldn't create, it disconnected, I rejoined, disconnected, rejoined, 10k queue... managed to get to the front of the queue, made all three chars amazed to get all three names. Realised upon logging back to send a screen I had 3 chars on a normal not PVP server... It had swapped me over to a normal server between lag outs, despite sitting there in the queue for the PVP one I wanted.
---
Lost 1/3 names. Told the group about my plight. 3 of them had the same issue without realising :/
---
As a Dutchie I’m looking forward to play with the nords! Majority is super friendly and have a calm accent; UK, please come with us!
---
Yeah, you can always make a starter account or something and test it
---
Shit server name and medium population. Worthless names

Because he plans to only play on this realm?

Just name reservation, you can't play or anything. 12 hours ago, if you had an active sub, you had a chance to just reserve a name before they'd get taken. Servers will indeed go live in 2 weeks.
---
&gt;Since they are 2v1 
---
Good luck with those numbers...try 20-40v1....streamers are going to be protected.

Humor is always subjective, but I personally find his constant state of sarcasm and malding very entertaining.

As for being rude to his viewers, I don't know where you've got that from. Sure, he's done some highlighting of genuinely dumb people, but that is  not 90% of the time or a majority of his viewers.

[LiterallyABlackBear](https://www.reddit.com/user/LiterallyABlackBear/) did you get your Thex? :D

---
Pick one. How did you play BfA if you haven't bought it?
---
Warlocks have had several revamps. I can’t keep up 😅

My rogue is named Umad
---
Dude I wanted the name Randy or bobandy so bad. Gone though. Rip.
---
Absolutely. Agree 100%. I think to prevent getting smacked as a low gear fresh 60 you should gear tf up before you even consider PvP. That’s the way it’s always been.
---
In 2077, 3D printing will do for guns what sodastream did for soda

I have Vancleef, Wrynn &amp; Tirion on Herod 
---
Disc - EazyKO#5044
---
Ok then. I am already able to enter the world in classic instead of just name reservation and already leveling. I think when the rest of people will start I'll have 60 already.
---
I see. So I take it you are the chosen one then.
---
Doubt it, things seem to be stable now.
---
Took me 50mins to get my name's on the server I wanted and didn't get 1 out of 3 so I'll take the 4th one as compensation for having to be tired all day today at work :).
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying there is anything wrong with PVP.  I played vanilla WoW on a PVP server and only migrated in WOTLK.
---
It's just I didn't actively go out of my way to 'do' world PVP so my main experience with it is either A: being ganked/camped while just wanting to quest and having to go in this circle of killing each other or B: high levels camping lower level areas.
---
Yet I'm always super tempted to go PVP just because for some reason that feels like the true experience, even though for someone like me it only adds extra frustration. I just wonder how many other people are this way and feel drawn to PVP servers even though they don't really care about world PVP.
---
Looking for Vitamins on Herod, PST please. Thanks!

No, wats on second.

I have these names, contact me on discord Do#0001

If anyone has the name "Lilitu" on Shazzrah plz PM!

Gather more RU players, so many like the GER and FR so blizzard can ignore you.  
---
Otherwise accept your faith..
---
Dude, that is not how the server pop display works. It is based on people logged in not characters / realm

Ah. So i dont have an active subscription. So no name reservations for me?    Alt+ctrl...lets get them accents in the names :)

 "Streamer is just a person"
---
NO - never was, never will be

Lul I just tagged you in a comment, then saw this. Nice my dude! BUT: Names might be saved to the account after deletion, so you maybe want to talk about when to delete it. I found an unreliable Source saying 60/90 days, yesterday someone said only 10 days. Anyways.. gl!
---
Despacito
---
^ this so much
---
Yes. Yes you are! :D
---
For the horde!
---
This is true. Warrior did have one great feeling. Charging in with recklessness, sweeping strikes, and whirlwind. The damage caused is absolutely insane and could destabilize a group fight in any BG.
---
Then I think about solo play... 
---
“Oh look, a warrior. Let me wait until he attacks a mob then hit him when he’s absolutely vulnerable as shit.” How much graveyard time do I really wanna spend this go around?
---
haha thats rad! hopefully see you round
---
Pyrewood
---
Shazzrah realm is going to explode launch day, the pve realms and golemagg had long queues to enter (around 9k), shazzrah directly didn't put you in queue, you were kicked from server directly.
---
Same.
---
Hahahah perfect
---
35 on fairbanks. Welcome brothers!

Clinton or Epstein also works

Right? When asmon gets bored on Faerlina, instead of Project 60 it'll be Project invade Herod just for the lulz

You wont get to keep those names. Will have to rename after the first report.

And not a single Scandinavian letter in your post, 0/10 effort.

---
Highly doubt this man. I think they were super sincere about wanting to not piss off a huge portion of the community. Gaining respect of the community means people tune into them more and more likely to donate. They’re also all friends. I think they’ll take playing with their friends over going to another server to make people upset. And there would be a huge push to gank them if they went back on their word.
---
Oooh Harambe https://youtu.be/OJw3MmL-Omk
---
&gt; world first?
---
Anyone want to tell them?

Omg the word shill. I feel like I’m back on the pserver sub
---
One thing I do remember about locks. 
---
“What’s a mobility?”
---
Reality is that at this stage it's literally impossible to tell which server will be the "better" one. All the indications we have are just from the reddit community alone, which doesnt really make up a very huge portion of the overall Classic population.
---
Yeah! You got it bro!
---
Even though I thought I made it in time, my name's were taken too ☹️

The last few months already felt low mod, how much worse can it get?

WTB Massa, Massacre, Jormungandr

---
Follow Tribe&lt;APES&gt; on Twitch
---
Yeah exactly so that does not mean that for example golemagg would have any less pop then shazz, just bc people were faster to reserve their names there and then log out
---
Both Alliance and Horde can play on the same realm
---
Well its possible in retail hence the question probably.
---
Yeah that is what I did during Legion. Thanks for your reply anyway!
---
I lost one of my names this way :(
---
Was "Dass"  
---
I deleted it to tweak it a little, spent maybe 7 seconds and BAM, gone
---
The beauty is that the first person on each server that wanted to make that meme, became the one to sacrifice himself to allow others to make the meme.
---
My rogue is "Stab"
---
 Bring him the gabbagool!
---
32 here. You guys have room in your guild for a warlock?

So I’m not a wow player, I’m a final fantasy 14 player but I see this reddit and whatever y’all did this weekends sounds like it was a lot of fun. Can y’all tell me exactly what was going on? It seemed like an entire community party type deal for the weekend and I wish square Enid would do something like it.

Lol "the alliance server"
---
I think they're reffering to being 12 years old in 2004, then getting addicted to WoW and now, 15 years later, still being a virgin because of that.
---
All you have done is insult them, without giving any point that I can see, except "Dey arr nekbeerfs!!!"
---
Imho, the RP/RP-PVP servers will have a lower population, but they won't see as many tourists so they will have a steady population. That's one of the main reasons I'm gonna be playing on Hydraxian.
---
"You have 3 fears!" Yeah, and diminishing returns, and exhaustion has DR and you have to be specced into it. Demo can usually leech tank with the 31 point pet, but I never ever specced demo.
---
Please stop posting about shitty twitch celebrities. Please stop making them popular.
---
He made them all human because they are IRL. Otherwise, the hunter couldn't be a human.
---
Not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but hunter pets also don't scale with gear (at all), so in later phases the pets damage becomes significantly worse.
---
I got my name on both pvp servers within 10 minutes
---
last thing i saw from % for Shazzrah horde would be on 55% and Ally on 45% not sure if this is still correct but it would be pretty cool to have a server that is as close as possible to 50/50

&gt; Lucifron, the first boss of MC? It's an AoE fight. Probably 60% of your total time spent in MC you're casting instant spells, hard casting is something you do only sporadically.

Yeah, most people don't realise how complicated a rotation can get if you are looking to push the absolute limits of the class.
---
That should be a bot on this sub if anyone writes lvl 25 druid vs lvl 17 hunter.
---
I'd rather not play on the Illidan of Classic, thanks. Thinking server names matter is why bloated servers like that exist.
---
It's also not my fault Blizzard gave us very few Eastern PvP servers to choose from.
---
We end the lives of sentient creatures by the tens of thousands. No whiskey, though.
---
Only six English EU servers is not enough... I reserved my names but I think they're underestimating the popularity of this game...
---
Shazzrah
---
never fails to blow my mind how even the two factions are even after years of pro Horde propaganda
---
He doesn’t have a real following I wouldn’t worry
---
I mean my name is litterally a word from one of the most common languages on the planet so it's not the biggest surprise ever either, but it still really sucks when I always got my nickname whenever I had a reserving going on. With that being said my nickname isn't super wow lore friendly so I guess it's not for the worst, but for the sake of identification it's still annoying just playing on classic I've already had people asking on my battletag if I was that dude they played before with because my nickname was different.
---
What is you resolution?
---
This needs to get as far into the sea as possible, out of sight out of mind. Ew.
---
All my three names were already taken :(

But I got a way around it. Different Server xD
---
Working on doxximg this kid.  Any info please PM me in private, I'll ruin him
---
Its very very simple and I really don't know why are there even questions in this regard.
---
You need sub to log into the game.
---
To make a character you need to log into the game.
---
Simple as that. Its not about them being greedy, its simply about how it always worked and will work for plenty of reasons.
---
Sorry my bad. I was sloppy when I read wallan00:s comment. Missed he wrote "switch one to PvP". Thought he was talking about creating one new PvP server. Not converting an existing PvE server into PvP. Yes that would be unfair.
---
damn son never seen such salt
---
This really depends on the mobs, the pet and the healer.
---
No I'm not lmao. It's TRUE.

---
I'll be using mine for threat reduction/aggro in the beginning of a boss pull where I am fully buffed. Its also a great item to alleviate threat if you have a warlock/rogue tanking a boss.
---
But there are lots of people who can pay to reserve a name...do you not get how businesses work, or are you just a troll?
---
To reverse this do you simply just go back into your WTF and delete the script you used or does it change any other settings?
---
Yeah, cash or in game, the rare names are worth bank. I wouldn't doubt any 2 letter word/name selling for 1k+ gold in game, probably more on the highest pop servers. And that is low balling it, I would guess the best ones are 10k+.
---
Not entirely true. Due to Hunters having access to less % increases through talents than some other DPS classes and specs, they do fall off slightly.
---
I never enjoyed Alex. I saw his ego way way over the roof unfortunately. But as I can see he was just a normal guy who uploaded videos and had a fan base. Later I saw he was just being a jerk.
---
After the Stresstest I wasn't super-hyped because I'm very competetive with my mindset and knew I'd lose everything. But guys.. reserving my names yesterday was just the trigger. I'm in Classic mode. I try to solve as many real life issues in 2 weeks as I possibly can. So I can horde new issues up for the first 2 weeks in Classic.
---
why would  you sub to name your toons?  basically throwing 7,5€ out the window. no thanks
---
The fucking "Only players who already have characters..." message made me lost my main name!!! Just in 1.5 minutes!!
---
And it even isn't a extremely popular name! In fact I could use it (just for testing) on all the others EU servers 2 hours later...
---
If anything layering prevents stream sniping. Sure you can kill them once but after that they can just join the group of one of their followers and you won't be able to find them again.
---
Actually no one has mentioned that.
---
I haven’t given too much thought into the pet game as I’m most likely just going to use a cat for the pushback on casters.
---
Just delete or type "0" instead of "1" there
---
Omg ponyprincess is a great name, sucks I've already got 3 reserved
---
It was like that in vanilla
---
Indeed neighbor, indeed.
---
Lol , No, not on a PVP server.  
---
On a PVP server you are never ever able to create on both factions, not with 1 account at least
---
Awesome! I was worried it would be like 70% alliance and 30% horde
---
Oh yeah creating new servers would be fine.
---
With so many fans following him it's likely that the servers will end up creating an entire layer just for Asmongold and his group, which means players from the opposing faction will have a hard time finding Asmongold.
---
Spaniards v Apes.
---
Pick your poison.
---
kind of a vague question. the 126 combat style is all of them.

Alliance :)
---
you can see by looking at the server list, the lowest on the list had highest number of people trying to log in
---
Nope, and hopefully it will stay that way
---
Many factors are involved.
---
- what class? Warrior vs Hunter are two completely different experiences 
---
- how much time do you have each day? If you can only play 2 hours each day it's not gonna happen. The more time you can spend obviously means you can levels faster.

Hey thex. I just created a quick piece of code that's trying to create your name. Will run it until release. It trys every 5 seconds so gl.
---
No we didn't
---
[Who needs desk space when you can just Rapha it](http://www.esreality.com/files/images/2016/109798-bn5.jpg)
---
Exactly
---
If you're worried about wpvp as a warrior, phase 1 would be the best time to level one in that perspective. There's no honor system and everyone is just worried about leveling. Even the speedlevelers will have other things to worry about besides ganking like farming high end mats and getting raid ready. You might find some gankers in contested zones, but you'll have plenty of people to group with to help you out while you quest and help kill the gankers.
---
Because it s far better than the other specs anyway.
---
Dude, this name is great!
---
Blizzard know what they are doing? Errr yeh ok whatever.
---
Autoloot is in the game. It was not in original classic.
---
Hunters are probably most like a “jack of all trades” class like your character is/can be in RS
---
Logged in 10 minutes beforehand. Clicked on the server as it went online. Was kicked 10 seconds later. Logged in again and the servers were marked as incompatible... 
---
I opened the game via shortcut so there was an update I haven't downloaded... 
---
Fml
---
I already redesigned all 3 of my characters, without problem.  Took minutes each and I have common names.
---
changes somebody else is trying that name that exact second are infinitely small
---
But isn’t that what meme formats are like? A joke that gets re-contextualised to reach different audiences. I still thought it was funny even though it’s not original.
---
I know, the guild im in is making the server selection ~at launch, so reserved names on both. Shazzrah had 10k ques 2h+ after the name reservations started. Shazzrah was on HIGH population this morning.
---
And Shazzrah was so laggy, that people could add names faster than the server registered those (thats why you see someone having 4 / 5 reserved names).
---
I made a char on this server but i'm not dutch, is that allowed?
---
You just entered a place all men fear. gl
---
So launch day will be hell?
---
&gt;and a little bit of luck
---
This wasn't a little bit of luck, luck was absolutely everything in this scenario. In a perfect scenario, you would have a much higher chance at your most important name, because if someone want several names they'll probably pick your name after you unless it's their most preferred name as well. This was some lucky people getting on instantly and being able to make a char within minutes, to other people not being able to even enter the server for 40-50min and when they finally got on, the game for some reason placed them onto the wrong server. There was nothing connection or clicking about this, it was all luck.
---
Huge Scandinavian community on Shazzrah
---
lmao, thanks
---
You uh, do realize there's a reason he took a picture?
---
Wrong, they improved their DPS throughout vanilla and were at their worst in Molten Core in relation to other DPS'ers where getting top 10 in any boss was a huge achivement and where at their best late AQ/late Naxx, they have some powerdips here and there, they dipped early AQ but bounces back late AQ and dipped the first 2 quarters in Naxx where Rogues/Fury Warriors exploded but bounces back in with late late Naxx gear.
---
At min/max MM gear, you started to win some bosses as the top DPS'er in Naxx and could frequently get top 4 doing Patchwerk.
---
It will only be phase 1. Just phase 1 will last for 2 years
---
I knew a dude in classic named Skeletor who was only 16 at the time and didn't even know who Skeletor was.  I wonder if this is him lol
---
It's not actually about the streamer per se, but about the rabid fanboys that follow them around. It's THEM we are trying to avoid.
---
Looks like I'll be off to Shahrazz, seems like its gonna be good for horde pvp and English speakers. Gonna be raiding mainly.
---
Now to decide warlock or mage....
---
I was just asking, thanks for the quick answers.
---
^ true
---
I dont think they will be that fun if they do have official forums. They dont let the drama filled posts stay and over moderate.
---
Realm forums for retail are dead.
---
6 days /played is pretty fast, especially for someone who has never played vanilla, like OP. First time player would probably be closer to 10-12 days /played.
---
Meanwhile EU stayed up late for it... No way to make everyone happy.
---
And I still didn't get my name on one server :(
---
Nice, my dad works at Blizzard though and I'm already playing WoW 2.
---
It depends on sharding implementation and sharding depends on player numbers. It's complicated.
---
Just for you
---
No the only QOL will be through addons.
---
hey dont give him the answer!
---
No doubt.  My wife and I were dating when wow first came out and she was long distance. We played WoW as our way of hanging out together.
---
15 years later we're married with 2 kids and cant wait to play classic. Super nostalgic for us.
---
Really wasn’t that bad lol
---
To the dirty dog that stole Thrillhouse on Oceanic Arugal... I will find you
---
Also this wasn't about a name, it was memed from the original where his "perceived" friends laughing at him changed his account password as a prank bro!.  I'd be pissed too, to a lesser degree.  But, your notion you know what levels of discomfort is socially acceptable to show in your own dwelling and instantly knowing his psychological profiling is obtuse.
---
That being said, I laughed my ass off with the finger pointing
---
I think it's far from balance in terms of PvP skill. The horde side has multiple rank 1 players that each have multiple rank 1 titles starting all the way back from tbc/wotlk. The best alliance players on there is swifty? IIRC hes earned 1-2 gladiator titles and that's about it, don't believe any of the rest got that high in arena.
---
Horde having all the good PvP players will also attract all the other good PvP players, as people simply attract to the best servers(look at tich for an example). I'm pretty sure this server is going to be very screwed in terms of Wpvp, more then likely horde is going to dominate.
---
You could try Arms warrior. (might need to do some respeccing for raids), as Arms can pump out some crazy spike damage in both PvE and PVP with mid-average gear. I had multiple instances in Vanilla where I was attacked by someone who way out geared me and my Arms warrior destroyed them with some lucky hits.
---
If cheez or cheezus is out there on herod, lets make a deal
---
Nope, wrong. You could barely get top 10 dps in Molten Core and BWL while you started to actually win the DPS fight late AQ40 and late Naxx, you powerdipped early AQ and early Naxx but only get better the more gear you had.
---
Ally checking in with 4 other friends who will play
---
That's the good part about making up your own names. I rarely ever have issues getting them. F.e. my Enhancement Shaman named Hammerrhoids

Your too kind , i got on super quick so stole my friends names :D do i be nice or do i sell them to them?
---
 Abbott &amp; Costello
---
idk what are u up about... with today's server hardware we wouldn't get any lag or instability....
---
lol what server? Two of my guildies went Trapzdatass and Sapzdatass
---
Well, I had to check it cause I couldn't belive what you said.  
---
PvP servers were changed to normal in BfA...
---
Thank you for the reply man! I came to the realisation my question wasn’t as apparent (?) as I thought, haha! Thank you so much again for trying to help though dude!
---
Surprisingly I got Steakbomb but my back up name Panser/Panzer was taken before I got in. I had like 6 different names I was going to use anyway.
---
I got my names alright! On Pagle server:
---
Druid named : Driud
---
Warrior named : Warior
---
Hunter named : Huntar
---
Like most people have said, there really isn't. Outside of the option to turn on auto loot (one mob at a time) there really isn't much improved qol changes! But that's part of the original feel and experience people have come for. Best of luck dude!
---
As long as layers feel transparent, almost as servers within servers, I think it will be a success.
---
no :)
---
Same lol fucking pyrewood
---
You’re right brother, kind of odd to compare the games. Guess I’m just desperately trying to find a class that comes remotely close to the rs feel :c
---
Was mighty kind of you.
---
However, the way he whined about it, I would've thought he'd be most estatic...
---
I never watched him i never got why people don't like him. 
---
Now I do, lol. :D
---
I look at it this way:
---
A ranged DPS, in order to attack a target can position themselves in a way that at most his target can also attack them back, if it is also a ranged DPS.
---
A melee-DPS, in order to attack a target has to position themselves in a way where he is targetable by every ranged-dps in proximity of their target. There also is no reason for the enemy-team to "clump up" in a way that makes sweeping-strikes and whirlwind hit more than one target.
---
A healer, in order to contribute positively to their team, can position themselves in a way where he is a target to absolutely noone.
---
And as you say. A solo Warrior is probably is the most vulnerable target in WPVP whereas a hunter is among the least.
---
If he’s played other versions of the game he’ll be fine. And it sounds like he has based on the way he worded it.  At any rate, it’s only an arbitrary baseline regardless.
---
I think Faerlina will be the best (East Coast PvP) community server, honestly. You get the streamers, sure, but you also get the people who don’t care and just want to have fun. Herod is going to be like playing with this subreddit, which is a very drama-filled and extremely passionate group. Nothing wrong with that, but not for me. 
---
Thalnos will probably be similar to Faerlina, but you trade streamers for Brazilians who will never really leave the server. I give most streamers a month at most before they’ve moved on to other games.
---
But lets make it clear, classic does autolooting of THAT mob you clicked. In retail you can AOE autoloot multiple nearby corpses with one click.
---
So essentially the classic autoloot option just saves you one SHIFT press when looting, nothing more, nothing less.
---
Alliance på Shazz? Du är fan modig.
---
I love the fact you just go for what you like instead of numbers. This is really motivating, thank you for the reply mate!
---
Nah, there will be plenty of us Danes on Golemagg.
---
In a game where social aspects are as vital to the gameplay as in classic, I really don’t want to encounter language barriers
---
Looking for “Zes” on Herod. I’ve been Zes since I started playing, on my original druid. Would love to return to that name.
---
I'm re-reading the Silmarillion these days. If not for the fact that I won't play alliance a nelf Fingolfin would be lit.
---
Yeah. Play retail.
---
They have tons of abilities, but that makes them super versatile. I like playing a class that has an answer to almost anything.
---
Pm if you have Pi on either shazzrah or Golemagg
---
So there I was--ready to roll my gnome mage like I had been planning to do for over a month. Got my name, made the gnome. Then, curiosity struck! I had two names left to reserve... could I get the name of [my favorite boss of all time](https://imgur.com/9V712Ck)? A few clicks later and I've got this guy with the same character model and everything...
---
Hence my dilemma and where I need some advice from the community: is the opportunity to be Aran worth giving up the amazing gnome racials for? I plan to PVP heavily, so escape artist is pretty meaningful... But the RP potential--macro'ing my blizzard to "[I'll freeze you all!](https://youtu.be/XZbBHr92SRQ?t=36)"
---
I guess I could always make him a gnome...
---
What do you guys think? Is the name sick? Will people appreciate the reference? Is it lame to have a bosses name? Please help me make this decision! (:
---
...and then you realize popping this made you drop the flag, you can't click it off and get the flag back faster than the enemy can click the flag and you lose.
---
Fair enough, I know this is classic and there are tons of options for questing if you dont want to hit the PVP hotspots, I'm actually tempted to jump on PVP after managing to reserve my name on Shazzrah and seeing there will be a big Eng/Scandi pop there
---
Whoever has balto on herod would be nice if we chatted :)
---
reddit.com//r/klassiskwow
---
Yes I would recommend it I’ve been playing since the launch and I’m addicted to it. There is so much to do. Crafting and gathering is a game in itself. The combat is just amazing and there are so many raid bosses it’s ridiculous. I’m not good at describing stuff cause I’m not much of a talker but it’s worth to try it out if you are looking for something different. But it’s an mmorpg so it won’t be too much different from wow pertaining to gear and the leveling system and farming bosses for gear or glam or doing dailies and weeklies. Best game I ever played. I’ve seen all the hype here on reddit about wow lately and wanted to know about that
---
I hate his face and have never watched his stream once.
---

Sure can! Just change the drop down over the "play" button to retail WoW. Doesn't work for Forsaken yet, though.
---

---
Does it work with the legs too?
---
I thought proundmoore was the biggest in claaix or is my memory bad
---
Yes, haha. It’s a long story but the point was to take the name before all the human priests out there.
---
It was you.  I was trying for that, so i made Harambes latino cousin.  Harombre
---
No hablo spanish
---
EU Shazzrah - Mehh someone has managed to take my two beloved names- 
---
Haw and Boo. 
---
Not fast, your last is the rule of the game. 
---
So I have settled for-
---
Booty
---
Grump
---
And the mighty - Meatsceptre
---
Mööse?
---
You sure showed him, buddy!
---
&gt; Even if its imbalanced and unfair 90% of the time, to me, its an integral piece of WoW that I don't want to miss out on.
---
It's not integral to WoW. That is why PvE servers are called Normal servers by Blizzard, and why about as many people in real vanilla played on Normal servers as played on PvP servers.
---
Rolling on a PvP server is making a deal where you put up with being griefed in exchange for the chance to cause grief to others. If you enjoy that, more power to you, you can all go roll on a server where you can grief each other.
---
Those of us who think that is a terrible deal can all go roll on a Normal server, and everyone is happy. 
---
Personally I tried rolling on a PvP server, ganked a few people, got ganked a few times, and found I got no joy out of ganking people. So I will be on a Normal server because literally nothing about the PvP server experience appeals to me. Been there, done that, not my cup of tea. And that is okay.
---
That might be the best list I’ve seen. I didn’t realize they were allowing Blizzard IP names
---
I am just glad the ruskies have there own server. They always spoil everything.
---
In my experience there is rather a big amount of toxic player in most games (is not something related to your nacionality)
---
You can also rearrange your character order on the log in screen using the arrows like in retail. I'm happy about that one
---
Is Tuborg considered good beer in Denmark?
---
Maybe don't have such a generic name then :)
---
Very well done
---
automod removed my thread about Thex, I really need to know if he managed to get his nickname.
---
I've never really had a special name. I'm the type of person that has several different names so I don't care either buy I got one of the names I wanted to use so I'm happy :)
---
I quit a month into BfA, I have no idea what that is.
---
that's really hard to do. Rs characters are designed to be self sufficient because it's not really a multiplayer game like WoW is. Obviously there are multiplayer activities, but you could theoretically 'beat' rs entirely alone. Wow characters have flaws that are covered by other classes because playing together is common. Pick the most self sufficient one, I guess hunter would be the answer.
---
ultimately though, you'll eventually decide what you want to do and you'll do that. Which is the optimal choice.
---
Yes but the word Pagle sounds English and Ateish sounds middle eastern.
---
Main one is missing here: "Can't you see I'm drinking?!"

That's great to hear!! Love that sort of stuff, unless he asks for payment in PM lol
---
./spit

Had that, swapped to art
---
I’m looking for Scarlet on Mankrik or Herod. Send me a PM and we can work something out.
---
I don't care, if that helps.
---
Nah, i made 5characters on same realm, and people manage to get even more then that.
---
But you wouldn't get more than one servers MAX population activa at any one time since there will be queues in phase 2 and onwards. 
---
So phase 1 = no queue but layering =&gt; 30k spread over 10 layers equals 3k per layer
---
Phase 2 = queue but no layering =&gt; 30k but only 3k can log in at any one time
---
Still the same number of people in Org or Sw
---
I only have a dagger :(
---
Dude I used to play with a restoration druid like maybe 10 years ago with that name. Is that you??
---
Same here. I got the second name I wanted to use so I'm kinda happy but I had like 20 names lined up so I wasn't worried
---
You can now get off a flight path at the next stop.
---
If I have multiple choices on who to invite I might skip the guy full of special characters out of spite.
---
It really ought not to be.
---
I'd be pretty pissed off as ill be lvling enchanting and tailoring to make gold. But once I'm established at 60 all my chars will have a engineering
---
Well you can login and create characters already (if you got a active sub)
---
You didnt connect to Herod in the first place. It was Pagle all along. Happened to me too but I noticed that.
---
Shazzra and Golemagg are gonna have more layers than an onion at this rate
---
I'd love to play games with anyone in my family. Excited for my kids to be old enough for games.
---
Macro servers for PvP are pure SPICY JUICE, sure it can be annoying to lvl sometimes but it's gonna be so fun to join in massive pvp battles guys!
---
Actually, you calling this "Cringe" is really what is cringy.
---
This "cringe" thing has become a fad where insecure children are having their egoes challenged at every turn, which is rather cringy.
---
Thanks for the answer, I'll give it a try. Btw, when was the game lauched, I know it's been out for quite a while. Back in highschool kids talked about it but I never really cared
---
Oh yeah, thats in there too. But kinda is in the "you can use launcher to login to your account without passwords" -type of things. So guessing thats something new, too.

Thank god i never bought it, and stopped mid Legion

How is this a better one ? You are still stuck on the dungeon/raid part of the story.

It's a South Park reference

Same I mean he makes sense on most of the red pill knowledge he drops tho

---
When I was checking the serach engine I found someone that made 9 :o
---
Rip
---
Play what your heart desires! You don't need friends when you start leveling, you will make them on the journey.
---
He's just another in a long line of pompous, self-aggrandizing streamer fucks. And the way he played that druid was 10/10 cringe.
---
Easy to got your name if it's unique and you are the only one who use it.
---
But you wouldn't get more than one servers MAX population activa at any one time since there will be queues in phase 2 and onwards.
---
Well the guild APES are going on Golemagg so there's that.
---
Yeah I uninstalled retail today. It's been on my computer since release day haha... I won't be going back if classic fails my wow time is over... (No king rules forever my son) if it's a success I play on.
---
I wonder what would happen if classic became huge. I'm guessing tbc, but imo it doesn't have the same appeal I wouldn't play tbc or even the ever popular wrath again.
---
Activision probably doesn't want classic to last since they can't really monetise it beyond subscription
---
Love it, but where tf are Lefou?
---
Fuck now i feel stupid of course stans father is a geologist
---
this thread did not age well
---
Oh I know you guys have good schools and speak it better than some English people haha.
---
Wish we could say the same for our language skills for communicating with our neighbours!
---
Me too. I was freaking out and kept pushing the button. As soon as I changes the race of my character it became available. Then i got all 3 names I wanted :)
---
Good one, that server rekindled my love for Vanilla.
---
Man, so many people were complaining and making decisions based on $7.50. The per entertainment value of that subscription is way higher than any other form of entertainment.
---
Yeah, I have like 6 names ready and the chances that anyone of them is taken on my server is very slim. Unless you absolutely want to have a very common name, it doesn't really matter.
---
U a troll I game too?
---
&gt;Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see “Low, Medium, and High” in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms. 
---
Which, I admit isn't super clear.

I dunno man, I watched her play Spiderman the introduction level. It's amazing how little information they receive in their head when doing anything with a keyboard.

I would say the same. Dont forget respecc costs. So you wouldnt have a dungeon and raid specc separately. We could talk about an extra pvp specc.
---
But the Infographic is more like an introduction to a class not what matters in min/max endgame raiding for example. You can always mix up the speccs and have better results than what the maker of infographic thinks \^\^

&gt; You do realise that after a month most of these people who are no super hyped on Classic will be gone right?
---
Why do you and others think this is a good argument?
---
Vanilla WoW was the best selling game OF ALL TIME. One of the greatest video games still made. 
---
Not that many people are going to quit, and I don't know why you think that. Private servers are fucking trash btw so if you are basing that off your private server experience thats a bad idea (horrible community, non-permanence of realms, everyone is different time zones, no ToS, no customer service, no management really at all).

Lives and relationships will be consumed by WoW again. 100%.

Asmon has said a hundred times he's a scammer and a charlatan. He will set up scenarios and create drama. He will turn up the asshole levels to 11 if somebody hits him with a 3. He has openly admitted he used to ninja loot and scame others. He shamelessly takes millions of gold from viewers and admits to even more than I have heard, I'm sure. People like him because of the drama, not in spite of it. He has had some funny moments, I've quit videos mid-watch because he gets to insufferable.
---
I tried to get a name for my friend but it was taken then i tried my name and it was taken then my second name ...  taken. All at 00h15

Thanks! Probably that is what happened. Tho I was so convinced that I was on Herod, lol

You still have to press play with the thumbnail in full view after you open the thread. That said, it’s a fucking tune so I’ll happily Rick roll myself

I hope windfury is just a placeholder character and it will be remade as a Shaman later on.
---
Try hard
---
In the beginning there where queues of 20k+.
---
It took about 10-15 minutes to get in when you had a 10k queue.  
---
There was a 10k queue for at least 1 hour (didnt actively check after that).
---
You can use this to calculate the amount of people making characters on this server.

Not 11, 13 in may, you guessed it right, 12 btw.
---
It's not a technical problem.
---
Blizzard wants to have healthy population server in the long run so they plan to put more players than Vanilla had so if more than half the player leaves after 2 months, then the server population is still ok.
---
Top comment on this thread. Someone else got it and gave it to him on Herod.
---
If you've got a little bit of Korean, playing on their servers is a great way to improve it
---
I wish I was in your position. Playing this game once more and be bewildered by the mystery that comes with it. Enjoy it mate
---
Bundle of sticks did nothing wrong.
---
A lot of people made four characters accidentally.
---
Happy fucking cake day.

Im not inventive with alt names

legends say he braved the fargodeep mine and defeated the blood fish at jerod's landing. he was about to explore the tower of azora until he was ganked by a PKer. RIP.
---
Killing somebody once or taking a mob from them once isn’t always done intentionally to piss somebody off. It’s part of the game. So what I meant is that in the course of you playing the game some people may get mad regardless of whether that was you’re intent and you may suffer as a result. Intentionally pissing somebody off would be corpse camping or repeatedly stealing mobs. At this point I would understand them being upset and reporting a person
---
Oh wow I didn't know there will be CRBGs. Thanks for that. Totally forgot this was already in Vanilla a thing, I thought it came with TBC.
---
Too long ago :D
---
Got my name and then my brother and gms name for leverage.  Feelsgoodman
---
Yeah.. but princessleia and yellow are not allowed? :O
---
If this is classic there was probably a significant amount of effort put in to that account. I'm sure most people would be upset if they lost all the work they did on their hobby like that, which I'm assuming this guy thought he did. There's something to be said for that level of frustration, but "manchild" isn't it, you're just a douche.
---
Nice! &amp; what class are you playing??
---
I #need Bubbles on Arugal

Bro it's like 3-4 hamburgers worth of money

---
What’s wrong with an English delicacy?
---
And that’s Outland if I’m not wrong, I played there and I don’t want that to happen again
---
Wow, how
---
Mixed faction? Who’s who?
---
So that's what that CVar does. Now work out what PraiseTheSun does and we're all golden for mysterious Cvars :P
---
I don't see why big streamers should be any different from anyone else in not wanting to play on the same server as big streamers.
---
Oh yeah, no problems here mate, just wanted to make sure the right information got out there :) Have a Happy Classic!
---
Heaven and hell are real.

Paedo means child, pedo means nothing but sounds like it means foot.

LF "Stefan" on Golemagg EU
---
If you are going horde and you like mage / healer styles, I would recommend trying a shaman.  They are a lot of fun, have incredible utility in a wide variety of situations with their totems, and they have a healing spec (restoration) and a ranged dps spell spec (elemental).
---
Scandinavian here, and yes, special characters are just stupid.
---
i still remember the dwarf rogue with the name "frombehind". still makes me giggle
---
BLASPHEMY!!!
---
\&gt;  I hate Asmongold so much, I never miss a stream or event he does 
---

Never! I will never serve you! Swolemagg is the goal!
---
Unlikely to be patched out by Blizzard as it's a Cvar that's been in there for at least a few years. It's also possible to do this on Live.
---
Some people REALLY want to play with their original names so I can't really blame them for subbing early, it's just two more weeks anyway.
---
What server?
---
Anyone take heroin yet?
---
Oomkin is the tank
---
Yeah I was also considering playing on a Russian realm but now when you mention that we won't have many CIS players there I think I'll stick with EU.
---
From your icons i see you are a fellow druid like me :) (i'm going alliance though). I really like to play the class role into the game. Mindless killing of all living things seems just ain't the druid way - you gotta maintain the balance. I consider all druids allies and the whole idea of the Cenarion Circle looks awesome to me. I wish there was a player-driven druid only guild allied to each other on both sides.
---
I'm a spaniard, I will play in Shazzrah and I can speak perfect english since I was 12. Is that a problem? I don't know why people here is so angry about it.
---
It is not our fault that we don't have spanish servers.
---
Ugh

---
Good names are, by definition, names people want
---
If this is true then who are you to demand that Asmon play on a server with streamers?
---
Thing is, over on retail WoW, Non-RP names no longer get reported and changed on RP realms like Argent Dawn EU, so I'm not sure if it'll apply to Classic.
---
I wonder who got my original characters name "Omen" on Herod.  I logged in right at 6 and got stuck on "only players who already have a character on this server can create one", tried going back to server select only to be disconnected.   Shit was fucking dumb.
---
I wonder if there is any Nostalrius reference.
---
I always thought it's funny that they used the tower of azora in the episode because there is literally nothing interesting there, should've chosen jasperlode mine which is also in elwynn and a low level thing but at least has some quests attached to it.
---
They didnt buy bfa they were able to reserve their name just with having an active sub. An active sub doesnt require bfa.
---
LF Bean on Herod - pls PM &lt;3
---
It's also the only server that is "high" pop on the realm list. (rest are medium/low)
---
*dazed*
---
Can't wait to hug my enemies or run away as an elusive pokemon.
---
With the added bonus of not getting invited to groups when people don’t know how to type your name
---
lól
---
My top choices were all Cowboy Bebop names ( which were all taken instantly on US Whitemane ). 
---
My top 3 prior to name reservation was live were:
---
1.) Faye
---
2.) Spike
---
3.) Ein
---
I had a very very long list of names on my phone, so I went with 3 backups that weren’t taken yet. 
---
I reserved:
---
1.) Onetruemorty
---
2.) Bestgirl
---
3.) Clobberella
---
Pk is badass
---
I don't think there will be a huge population there ever, but I'm guessing that it'll be pretty stable. I'd wager a lot of the tourists aren't interested in going rppvp, and the people that wanted that community are in it for the long haul.
---
It's not going to be my main server, but I will definitely be spending some time there when the mood strikes me.
---
Great name
---
His friends call him Smakl
---
Seriously ... I tried saving two names from books I read (Orcs: First Blood) and both were taken immediately.
---
My regular online name was free, same a my friend's. Even after about half an hour.
---
Looking for Raz/Razz on Shazz or zandalar tribe.
---
Been my in game tag since classic and I lost it during name reservations, maybe we can arrange something?
---
There's a lot more fellow Grobbulus players than I thought. I'm so pumped!
---
Alright. Well, a Rogue could do it, too.
---
Oh did it? Haven't seen any posts about it lol ah well.
---
I still have this on my horde rogue on live!
---
Huh... someone should post this on r/soylent Thought I wonder if they would get it.
---
WTB
---
You cant point on a server and say "this is alliance only server" and avoid it. Imagine everyone would do it. Luckily there is very low amount of people with the thinking like you, so it doesnt matter much.
---
This is what I did with my irl buddy. I got in, secured my first choice. He was still locked out so I just saved his name.
---
From what I understand it's a guild of harcore pvpers who make it miserable to play for the other faction.
---
It's him guys! It's classicwow!
---
thats just mean now
---
Absolutely. Story wise, World of Warcraft (referred to as vanilla, when you talk about the version before the first expansion) is set 4 years after the frozen throne and is it's canon successor. If you didn't play at the start, the story inevitably progressed without you.
---
The one that's an actual name.
---
i love ron weasley, but you can’t use him as an orc. even tho he’s a ginger, he do have feelings. 
---
oh and baine ain’t that good either so
---
Best all around spec, OP making excuses for making such look like shit.
---
Healing 5 mans is so mind-numbingly boring/easy that I pray one of my dps is big dick enough to pull agro but they usually do shit for damage so I just start dosing too.
---
mby you should work on getting some money then, instead of sitting on reddit complaining.
---
Tribe has a server command on his twitch that says golemagg and there were other posts about it. But nothing is ever confirmed. That is nice of you to give them some competiton, hope you will have some fun battles.
---
There is a difference in beer even with the same label. A Carlsberg bottled in .dk is not the same as one bottled in .de
---
Could have subbed early and played the stress test
---
Haha, well he's rogue so coming from behind ain't no issue here x)
---
streamers are the new form of hollywood celebrities, this isn't a new thing, it's just a different application. I stopped beleiving in the economy when stuff like this heavily began toppling how to make mass profit rather then actual hard work but i guess that's just me.
---
He’s gonna be a legend in-game too now
---
i was considering using a weird chatacter for my name but i avoided it for that reason): also i LOVE freehugs(:
---
it's enough, because i'd say 60-75% of the player base is going to wander off after a month or two. having more servers leads to merges later, or dead servers.
---
I mean he did brave the Fargodeep Mine and he defeated the Bloodfish at Jared's Landing.
---
So if your not worried of it beeing taken that sounds like it’s not a highly desired name? Fair enough I wouldn’t buy a early sub either if it was super unlikely someone would take my preferred name.
---
There are people out there who want a more popular name hence if the actually want it they have to sub early...
---
Seems so from all the treads and posts I've found.
---
Hence the quotes, it's server wide, but not a server-channel. Global is the word I was looking for at the time
---
&gt; You just happen to be using characters that exist in both ASCII and UTF8  
---
You knew what he meant.  
---
UTF-8 is designed as a superset of ASCII, because every other way of encoding unicode is uncompatible garbage.  
---
Regardless, what he means is *extended ASCII*, which gets shortened to "ASCII" in common (and technically incorrect) usage.  The reason people call this stuff that is because the method of entering IBM's extended ASCII set (128-255) is by manual entry on the numpad, which Windows still supports after DOS did it.  Other OSes usually use a compose key to make this happen, giving you usefully typographic things (to make an a with a hat, you'd type (compose) ^ a, that sort of thing).
---
And you really have to dig it
---
Heal
---
The irony value alone when you're shadow is worth it.
---
I would still be concerned of the fans and heat though, even though I understand that Macs would shut off automatically to prevent any damage.
---
The guy who took your name did it to save it for you? He was worthy of the mantle of Thex! Glad the OG thex got their name! Thats awesome
---
And this is just to name a character, I was just online on the alt account and it's STILL HIGH Pop, The highest queue I seen last night was 10k, and again I must say, JUST TO NAME A CHARACTER.
---
I was on discord with my friends and was watching asmongold. When I heard my friends getting disconnected I relogged 5 mins before to make sure it wasn't an inactive at server screen thing. One of my friends DC'd as I double clicked on Herod and got in before a queue poped, this was due to spamming left click on server name before it even turned from gray. I was the only person I knew in at that point even ahead of the streamers sitting there spamming enter on my name. 
---
I didn't get my name. I did however get GabeNewell(Not sure if I am going to play or give to my friend who wants it). I had one slot as my name was taken and tried all my friends first requests based on which ones seem most likely to be taken to not get any of them.
---
All in all it wasn't that rage inducing but I got lucky. One of my friends was almost to tears as his dreams of having his vanilla name vanished without him being able to log in for 40 minutes. It went about as I expected at every blizzard launch.
---
But he wasn’t named Simplicity
---
I'm so sad at what happened last night. Partially my own stupidity, mostly got screwed though.
---
I HAD the name I wanted 'Mask', on a rogue that looked how I liked - perfect!
---
A friend I was in a Discord call with was struggling to log in - so I used one of of my slots to hold onto his name for him.
---
When the time came when he asked me to delete the character, I reloaded the character list and clicked on the name I reserved for my friend - then hit Delete and went through the process.
---
Wasn't until I confirmed it that I realised the servers were bricking it? and clicking on my friends character didn't go through, and 'Mask' was being deleted.
---
Straight away panicked, went to create another one right away, took less than 20 seconds. It was gone.
---
I was so annoyed. Tried to help a friend out, got screwed by my stupidity and servers. Managed to get the name 'Màsk', just isn't the same though.
---
Dunno when you started or what the population of your server was, but there damn sure was on Tichondrius after the honor system got implemented but before BGs.
---
I won't argue with Classic
---
That was at Polk High, right? I saw that game.
---
Scandinavian here, special characters are just stupid if used wrong (like Légöläs).
---
Average time to 60 is 200-250 hours. Playing 8 hours a day will take anywhere from 26-31 days to get max level.
---
Yeah, that's ultimately what I'm doing. 
---
As for like you and me, personally I don't have an army of goons at my disposal, maybe you do.
---
Maybe next time you write a response, re-read it before you hit the post button. There's no reason to be a raging prick, the world already has enough of those. Just because someone has an opinion that doesn't align with yours, doesn't mean they are wrong, or that you should attack them. Just chill out.
---
Why does everyone want Herod so bad? Because of the layering issues?
---
Why wouldn’t you try to make him undead...?
---
Will your alt be Oof? 🤔
---
Please no, Russians ruin everything in English servers.  Stay on your own servers please.
---
congratulations on the sick name!
---
Because people sharing names is apparently immersion breaking.
---
I suppose that means we will have to kill all NPCs that share the same name and just leave the oldest alive.
---
Same goes for Player characters that put symbols into their character's name to avoid the name being taken.
---
But that’s not Shrek, it’s an offbrand equivalent
---
I just couldn't resist the stress test!
---
names*
---
Only you will see it right? Others will see the regular model?
---
Holy fuck that is creative af!!!!
---
How in the world did u come up with that???
---
You sound like a massive asshole to be honest.
---
I'd rather be a loser.
---
Switch to Herod, Faerlina will die once the streamers get bored and start streaming new content and you’ll be left in a ghost town
---
I'm assuming it's general bugginess rather than something targeted specifically at Herod. I was trying to create characters on Arugal and had the same bug pop me over to Myzrael instead, despite that being on the other side of the world... so I'm assuming that wasn't intentional.
---
Anyone here whose single that wouldn’t put that dick in that either likes dick or is a total liar. Let’s be fucking real.
---
Don't those keyboards have easier ways to enter the accents than a standard US keyboard?
---
Hope that's a PvE server.
---
You missed out on being a part of you're personal history for 2 weeks worth of sub money. Then came here to gloat that you missed out.  15 years ago,  when 15 bucks was 2 hours of work,  I get that.  15 years on,  however,  I will honestly pay 7 bucks for the best chance at reliving my glory with a name that I can get behind.  
---
As for the problems,  well... duh
---
the accents should be reversed so they look like angry eyebrows, they look sad now
---
Perhaps, but if you can find someone to level or grind with it would help your chances. You could also find some more low traffic areas to grind in if the main questing areas/mobs are being contested. You'd also have no problem finding dungeon groups if it gets too bad.
---
Herod alliance
---
Oversight my b.
---
I thought that at first too because Golemagg went from high to low. But it stayed that way 5 hours in so I no longer believe this.
---
Haha and I got sprinkles :)
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't know how many people will play classic. In fact I think there will be a lot of players, since there is only 1 pvp server and every popular streamer/youtuber/hardcore guilds like exorsus planning on playing there.  
---
Its just over WoW community isn't big enough to make changes like that (IMO).
---
But they were supported before... so are we still #nochanges or did you want to allow only changes you agree with?
---
Spending time with my wife and son before I disappear for a week
---
Oh this is terrible.
---
i wanted Whos for my warrior had to settle with Whoisthetank
---
They made what we are today.
---
Sadly
---
LF Billy on Herod.
---
Have Collin
---
You know it's funny. I had my name for like 3 years and someone whispered me once that I stole their name. The rage is real though.
---
And what exactly do you base that opinion on?
---
Sodapoppin and some of his friends will be horde, so there should be a decent split assuming he doesn't quit.
---
You guys can keep your reserved names and still start on Herod when the games launches. Either your names are already taken or they probably won't be once launch happens.
---
&gt; You get some replies and some says can you invite my friend Çôüüâ  
---
No, that guy can have his friend send you a tell lol.
---
So long story short... I met my wife when she was doing a stint on Horde side. So she is Alliance in her loyalties and I am of course a Hordie. For classic we are playing Horde because many of our friends and old guildmates are. But she did name grab on both factions... different servers of course.
---
https://youtu.be/q0jMy0qCQkc
---
If you aren't scared of a little latin flavor come to thalnos, lowest pop of the pvp EST from the looks. Sure herod will be fun but highest pop is not always the best. Learned that from original release.
---
Huh? Paladins are really good in Vanilla.
---
Im cringing your cringe you cringer
---
yeah thats why i have "Ligma" on a german realm in eu instead in he UK one. Germans wont understand Ligma balls.
---
Lo que nos vamos a reir con estos british 
---
JAJAJAJAJAJA ;)
---
Yup you can move your chars up and down the character creation screen and I think we might be able to mail multiple items at once in the mail.
---
We are NOT Rolling Shazzrath, only some PvPers, but we are distributed among all servers. Anyways, what's the problem with it if we were? Not our fault Blizzard couldn't be bothered to give us our own servers...
---
I got onto Shazzrah in about 1.40 am and there was no queue at all.

Yeah but which one, if you don’t know them first, is more likely to stand in the fire?  100% the guy with the stupid characters in his name.
---
why doesn't he use entangling roots?
---
This guy doesnt know its white claw summer 19

Good thing you got Jacaranda reserved
---
Great! That'll be my horde server then.

I don't get why they don't reserve your account name by default, letting you delete it if not wanted.
---
tche tche tche tche tche tche

Alliance scum this time. 
---
I want to do the other side
---
I rolled Alliance on Herod too!  Which toon are you likely to level first?
---
Friends and I are playing opposing faction of all the big streamers on heron and faerlina.
---
i think he's just reaching a different audience nowadays. back then he did videos, first one i saw was about doing big dick dps on garrosh in soo and i definitely laughed a lot about 'stand in fire dps higher' and as a fury warrior myself back then it was actually a very helpful video because there were a lot of tips on when to use bladestorm and stuff like that.
---
i loved his videos because his totally ridiculous over the top persona is funny to me for about 30 minutes, especially in videos where he deliberately compiled his most funny bits. nowadays he just streams which is an hourlong ramble of the same persona doing all kinds of stuff and in my opinion it's just too much after a while, especially when there is no clear structure to it. this seems to appeal to a lot of people, epsecially the omegakappacuckedlulz twitch crew, but i personally can't stand it.
---
Thank you. :D
---
Same story, and I couldn't log on midnight because they were building fiber for my community.
---
Can you +v me please?

Only you
---
Buy ammo and pet food. Otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Funny, I only see humans... looks like alliance assembling
---
Sure but why wouldnt you choose the best spec for the content youre primarily doing? I dont play hunter, but I plan on raiding as a pvp specced enhancement shaman, because I want to be as strong as possible in pvp.
---
BANNED.
---
We (Danish guild) sat and waited for the Nordic guild group to announce their decision so we could follow our fellow scandinavians. Now I just hope that the Spanish guilds and players that also roll on Shazzrah is keeping it English in General and Trade channels, and creating their own Channel for Spanish. If thats the case I am happy they are joining Shazzrah too!

so smart but now I'm worried I'll lose it haha

So find a unique name.

Herod = login queue for months

Thalnos = primary Spanish

I’ve leveled one during vanilla. He was 56 when tbc hit.

If you don’t have much luck with item drops, it’s a long road to 60.

Example, on the stress test, my first green and only greens until lvl 13 were from quests. No luck with bags. Overall sour experience.

Warriors are most certainly the slowest class for pve starting out.
---
Shift + Windows key + S
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
Personally I'd choose the least favorite name and delete it, then make one on Herod. Might be able to get something decent still. Then you guys can talk about possibly switching to Herod for the next 2 weeks.
---
Bertram is one of the bot names in dota2, so chances are someone thought of it.
---
I had 12k on shaz eu
---
LF Rush on Herod. I have: Whoa, Fizz, Eek, Perk, Perky and Ig on Herod.

should be possible.  
---
Ask chinese community about good VPN.

Everyone had the same connection issues, because tens of thousands of us were logged in right on time, all mashing the buttons. You had as much chance to get "Omen" as anyone else, you just got unlucky.

Very,Very bad time.Learned this the hard way when I was younger and played a hunter.lol

---
Sounds like retail to me.
---
Personally while lvling I run every dungeon once and try to do all the quests. Starting new group, giving away potions, scroll buffs, food buffs, sharing quests etc. and get shit done as smoothly as possible. If I have mana to spend that means I can simply go without drinking and abuse the 5 seconds rule. Wanding is the way to go.
---
That being said, I don't want to deal with people possibly slowing us down. I will explain it to you as it's beneficial to all of us. Keep on getting aggro and I'll immediately try to look for replacement. DPS is abundant and no one gives any fs
---
Got the name "Thinktank" on Herod and I couldn't be happier. Thought for sure someone would've taken it.
---
Lots of people have more then 3 characters. Servers was to hammered so some people manage to get more then 3.

Missed the reservation crazyness.

Is there a way to check the names already used, like armory or something ?

I really don't want to pay to be disappointed before launch, I'm not going to use that playtime for retail
---
I rolled Horde on Thalnos, and I speak Spanish and Portuguese so I'm excited to get some practice xD
---
Doing the things you do in a life.
---
If you want to play WoW before the release, you can try classes on RetroWoW.
---
if that really bothers you then your a muppet lol, the only RPers that actually report names are elitists or are very upset at you for some reason, I've played on Argent Dawn for 8 years and those are the only two reasons RPers ever report your name
---
Troll is best choice due to bow skill but all are valid.  
---
Pets are not normalized so some are much better than others. You should look up a guide on pets.
---
You need to constantly feed your pet or it will leave you forever. 
---
You need to buy ammo so you essentially have 1 fewer bag slot than everyone else other than warlock.  
---
DONT PUT ON ASPECT OF THE PACK AND DONT TAUNT WITH YOUR PET IN DUGEONS
---
People expect you to be awful so it takes a bit to prove them wrong.
---
Learn to kite well.

Or you weren’t the only person with this issue and a major part of the 11k queue were the same people queueing over and over.

thanks man :)
---
Great, gonna check out that addon! :)
---
Alidon and Ashina on Grob. Come on man. Alidon was my first character ever. Well I hope whoever did it makes them a hunter.
---
Anyone want the name Brad on Mankrik? I claimed it out of retaliation for someone taking my IRL name on Herod but I am releasing it now.
---
If anyone wants ZB just dm me
---
stay stocked up on ammo and pet food at all times  :P 
---
sucks when u cant attack or when ur pet runs away from home lol
---
My wife certainly does....
---
Most Canadians I know (east coast) are rolling Thalnos.
---
Yeah...I don't think you will.... You honestly probably couldv gotten that name on launch.
---
Same here mate, although after 3rd strike I'm already looking for replacement while still going. Bless warlocks and their summons

this couldnt make me any happier.
---
Damn.... Thing is an awesome name

may you link to discord?

oh definitely! free hugs is much better and original in my opinion!

Haha.. Rasmussen, can’t wait to kill a fellow dane (I guess) in the wild some day..
---
I would like my name, Skip, on Herod/Faerlina.  Long shot, but I am Skip on Illidan.
---
That'll be why there are tons of private servers hosting this version of the game and hundreds of thousands of players spread across them.
---
Makes sense.

Pk for sure
---
may be off topic, but mages are quite good with levelling because of the aoe frost build right? im planninng to go troll mage

Hey man,
---
I had a quick search through my wow folder and found language packs under under "_classic_/utils/locales". You could try copying the en-us.pak to your Russian client.
---
While this doesn't help with add-ons and has high maintenance it maybe at least lets you play in English on the Russian client.

Hope blizzard hears you!

The last bit is the bit I have an issue with. Vanilla WoW has a lot of active mitigation tools that are important for effective tanking of difficult content. The most notable one is Shield Block but there are others too. There are some enemy mechanics that make these things really important, the big one is Crushing Blows which requires a high Defense skill and/or enough avoidance that they won't ever happen.
---
Now, typically these things are only considered for endgame raid bosses, but imagine you're bringing an underleveled tank to ZF because there are just nowhere near enough warriors around (this means underleveled Defense skill so anything 3+ levels above him will be delivering crushing blows). He's been solo leveling and mostly has damage gear because there's no Dungeon Finder and leveling in dungeons isn't really viable. The DPS are free-firing and prioritizing AOE and high-health targets because this maximizes their damage meters, meaning the tank is working full-time to get as much threat as he can on all targets. His damage really matters for threat generation so he's dumping all his rage into offensive heroic strikes because his immediate problem is the rogue who's 6 levels above him is pulling threat off of him effortlessly. Is it any surprise that he's taking three times more damage than he needs to and is subsequently the first to die on unmanageable pulls? Is that really the healer's fault?
---
I mean kinda ridiculous to do it now, don't u think? Couldn't have waited a week?
---
I’m sorry for being unclear, my friend. I was expressing surprise and excitement about this discovery. Thank you for posting this!
---
Thanks, but it has to be "Asriel" \^\^
---
Nobody has to change anything? I don't think even Swifty himself cares about it that much.
---
Adding onto this, because for the above reasons my crew has picked Herod at the moment.
---
What are the odds that there will consistently be a que to get into Herod once classic launches?
---

---
Is Shazzrah shaping up to be the Chad EU server?
---
LF ‘Breezy’ on Faerlina
---
Yep that's true! Just found it funny
---
Great names on a roleplaying server.
---
One other thing to note: that's just reflective of people who are currently logging in. The numbers are higher than that, as people were consistently logging in-and-out. I, for example, didn't do my name reserve until a couple hours after it opened.
---
So, it makes me wonder just how high the activity is for Classic.
---
Don't forget about raid times
---
While it's possible to find east coast raid times on west coast servers most guilds will likely be planning to raid at the usual hours in west coast time which will put EST raiding til 2 am or so in most cases.  This might be ok if you don't work 9-5 m-f or only raid on Friday/Sat.
---
For some that works out better. For me I need earlier raid times since I'm at work at 6am
---
If you don't plan to raid then yeah it doesn't matter.
---
Nostalrius casted \[\[Blizzard\]\]
---
The name matching is just comparing it to a list of entered names for an exact match. If they added "Bigtitgotgf" (not goth, but got) it would not match on "Bigtitgothgf".
---
What a lot of people doesn't seem to realise is that yes you can reserve the name, but that doesn't mean a GM won't force you to change it in the future when you get reports. So reserving a potentially bad names just means you wasted a reserve slot.
---
A nude bald orc?
---
Tried for it and it was taken
---
Very... carefully...
---
he would be a schroedinger paradoxum of a wow player dead or not dead. you will see if he logs in

yeah, our group of 10 or so felt like we were forced to do the same. i am feeling there will be a perma queue. i am not sure I am even going to try to play monday night.

I'm disappointed this isn't top comment!!
---
I have reserved the name nightchief on one of the EU pvp servers if that’s of any use to you? Can’t remember which one tho lol, I done it quickly this morning as I had a spare name.
---
Shout me if you want it, it’s yours.
---
Thx guys!
---
Hm, can't remember correctly. Too long. Thought there was a version without blood and hakenkreuze.
---
Just by watching him. The warglaives thing is a great example. He's entitled, selfish, etc. I imagine he appeals to kids or people similar to him. The best way I can describe it is, he seems like the kinda guy who would be shitty to waiters.
---
Will do, thanks
---
Only once you are 45+ does it become easier, but that’s still dependent on grouping and finding groups without casters.
---
Shazzrah for All the scandavians?

Give me heal because I was trying to get that:(
---
It's so annoying, I watched like one WoW video months ago and I keep getting spammed by Asmongold videos. Watched one and I found him insufferable, so I clicked that I wasn't interested in this channel and to not recommend it anymore.
---
Since then I'v blocked recommendations from those channels like 3 times a day, yet my suggested is still filled with them. Youtube is horrible.
---
Gudskelov
---
I assume you can’t do this on live though right? Like my friend as a subscription atm but he can’t reserve a name for me or are we missing a trick
---
Sure, if you like pressing the same button over and over.
---
What a joker. Taking the names of characters rich in lore and making them run of the mill "toons". Shame.
---
How do you test this
---
True men take screenshots with their phones.
---
I lost a Druid names Nipslip after only two weeks, yet another one I had named Sisterfister survived something like 11 years.  All it takes is for you to tag a mob that some chud wanted and bam, reported.
---
They will probably add more servers as the need arises. Which is what they said they would do. Also some of those folks will change servers before launch, some will quit early on, and realistically, theres always going to be the big deal servers that have login queues even well after launch week. I guess Herod won the Illidan/Tich award this time.

Lol well I found the image online and found out it was card art for Hearthstone.  Found full card art for all cards [here](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Full_art).  Googled "cool free fonts" and found one named Odachi.  Threw it all together in Photoshop and added Stroke and some Drop Shadow
---
I don't expect Blizzard to do anything about it. I believe there is some overreaction to people avoiding Thalnos.
---
Ah damn that sucks dude. Why don’t you go with the funny little ì? I.e Kinetìx would work!
---
That white space. Oh god my eyes!

You need a sub, so there is no free trial.-all you need to play is an active subscription. Don’t need bfa or any other version

Friend of mine got rip. Great rogue name
---
I mean they have Swifty.. that is like having a flamethrower at a knife fight.
---
Yeah, it's a classic name of like from Vanilla days spelled just like in the title. I know it's a longshot, but I really would love to get that old school feel lol
---
I didn't get home from work till 30 mins after it started. I have the name "Bill" on my current server, and have had it since vanilla. I did manage to get my initials "JM" though, so happy about that. Also made an orc shaman named Aggra, so I got that going for me, which is nice.
---
fml I was that tired apparently, portal was the one i wanted since i couldnt get Frisk and i recall getting "Patch" not fucking portal.
---
Sorry for being an ass mate
---
You are a true gamer...
---
weakauras are propably the best way to go, though there are going to be ton of different stuntimer addons later on i bet.
---
I was hoping to get "Who" on faerlina. I was lucky enough to log into the server right on the dot. Typed in who. Got booted from the game. 
---
I was furious 🤣😂 I did snag the name Month though. So thats neat.
---
Lol this server is going to die real quick once the streamers get bored and find another game. Why the hell would you want to play in this server when it's going to be full of flaky fan boys?
---
Muwahahaha you're tooo late!
---
What happened to screenshots?
---
I know the names "black" and "White" are banned. pretty sad really
---
Not big into the Twink scene, but here is my idea. 
---
I'm not sure what the "best" would be, but I'd go herb + mining. Make some gold there from leveling, plus you can funnel ore to the Twink to lvl eng for bombs and the head slot. 
---
Also getting swiftness pot recipe drop early could net some money. 
---
I'd also make that main a Hunter, farming is really easy and you can solo tough mobs/rares.
---
This is wrong. In-game WoW Interface and most Addon settings don't take effect until character is created under the folder at character login.
---
What you need to do is create the char, exit game, then copy the settings and then log back in. Tested this multiple times in the stress test.
---
He should make a guild called &lt;Creeper&gt;
---
Yeah but that makes it hard for people to type, but I might do that!
---
All of us that are 30+ are boomers. We all chug Monster and mow our lawns at 7am. It's just how life is.
---
Gnohomo would have been better imo.
---
You may need a subscription, which should give you retail wow up to BFA. Then install the blizzard launcher and under the wow launcher menu pick the classic option and install
---
Just go with Coìnstar instead
---
Someone stole Odin moments after it opened :[
---
Also holy shit why so few servers? it's going to be a shit show at launch..

---
I felt this way too. I spent like an hour trying to figure out how large the spanish and Portuguese population would be and didn't really get anywhere other than some blizz forum post speculating and a brazilian server saying 800 people would be rolling there.
---
Welocome!
---
That's my only concern with having so few servers at the moment. It's not really fun to be on either side of that equation.
---
YoU DoNt UnDErStAnD!

Don't forget Stan's warrior: LovesToSpooge

---

---
Work,work,work
---
Fuck dude, how much for Banned
---
To be fair when it comes to youtube reaction clips he doesn't actually upload any of it personally, hell I don't even think he uses his own channel anymore.
---
It's people cashing in on the free content because he doesn't take action against people uploading and profiting from his stream.
---
**high five** yes lad! Funnily enough, I’ll most likely base my class off of what undeads can be hahaha. Buuuttt... a shaman is also cool. Hmm.
---
Played with a guy named Pigbenis. Apparently his main for two years.
---
Allegedly he had a pig named Benis, but some people took offense and he had to change it. Now it's Horsebenis or something.
---
In fact I'd even say the very definition of "asshole" is someone who acts as badly as possible under the rules.
---
Yea, I resubbed to wow for the first time since 2009 to play stress test and after trying the stress test and playing to lvl 15 I canceled with no plan of coming to classic. The game felt dead and just awful.
---
/me snickers at the person using a camera to take screenshots.
---
Oh really? I assumed that wouldn’t be the case as people could just level up? Or can you not enter the game? (I literally have zero knowledge of the system so sorry in advance)

You don't have to RP on an RP/RP-PVP server. You just have to respect those that do. 
---
General/trade/etc chat are out of character.
---
If you're in town and talking in /s or /y, just denote that you're speaking out of character if you are. Try to talk in character, though, it's fun! 
---
Basically just don't disturb those that are RPing and have an RP name and you'll be fine.

East coast pvp has it the worst i feel, our choices are a Mega streamer server / a brazilian server / and an insanely over packed server for people who dont want the first 2 options
---
From the survey looking like 56% horde/44% alliance. Im playing horde myself and id perfer it to be 50/50 or even alliance having the slight % lead. But thats just because it makes it easier to find people for world pvp

---
"bullseye" is hilarious, cause for the first few lvls, you'll likely miss a lot of shots.
---
As was the case in classic you need to level up a character to 55 and "sacrifice" that character to become a DK.
---
So a 55 Warrior turns into a DK losing, choose wisely...
---

---

---
I thought so too, but I did ask some players on the RP realm if they've been forced to name-changed from a non-RP name recently and one of them said their friend did. I don't know what name they had, but obviously it was "offensive" or a name like Madonna or Mcdonalds, then it would make sense.
---
Dude, I'm crying.
---
You actually can't have a name like that because you can't have numerals, fupaslayertwelve.
---
For leveling I'll use only TomTom and Joana's guide on my iPad. Don't want to spend any time for customizing other addons before 60 lvl.
---

Here is a shazzrah mega thread with almost 200 comments. Might be of use to you:
---
make an addon to set all your settings when you log in
---
Do like the rest of us cancel your sub and go play an old school MMORPG on a privet server. I was really hoping to be able to play WoW again and relive my old exp. on it, however, it looks like Blizz was able to kill it before it started.
---
Sure. But it's not like if everyone had smooth sailing you would have been any more likely to get the name you wanted. You would have been up against just as many other people who wanted that name, who all got smooth sailing too.

I tried to log in yesterday to reserve my name but it kept saying no realms were available .... what was the cut-off time for EU?
---
Yea for one reason or another it seems that all the EST servers were hijacked in one manner or another. 
---
I wanted an EST because, apart from living on the east coast, I would be able to find groups and our guild could raid easier in that time zone. We also have a couple EU players that would have too high latency going to a PST server. 
---
I’m really hoping they see all this and make another server or two for some added balance. But I guess time will tell.

Okay, some stuff I need to clear up about this hypothetical situation: if it's pack fights and the warrior is using heroic strikes instead of bshout for aggro, he's fucked up. If you're dumb enough to take a tank 3 levels below the content (again, talking dungeons, not raids) that's on you as a healer for allowing yourself to accept it.
---
That's how mafia works
---
I keep breathing a sigh of relief, because even if I rolled on the same server as the toxic people (Mankirk, not sure how that's going to be), I'm not going to be leveling at the same pace. By the time I get to lvl 5, this sub will probably already be in Tanaris.

Why is he so sad?
---
Streamers are on Faerlina.
---
Your commitment to the joke is amazing
---
tbh i think it was the completely wrong approach to allow reserve 3x names for "friends" or alts. Best why would have been to allow only 1 name reservation, that way most ppl would pick a name that they would play with, not holing hostage name that they will play in the future or just for selling.
---
Now if she was a Lady Worgen ...it'd be fine
---
I raided on Shadowmoon-US, and had the best time with some amazing people. Here's hoping some people are of the same mindset to avoid Herod's high pop. &lt;3
---
Good to go
---
If you search this subreddit for whitemane, there's quite a few meme posts. In those posts are several comments of people clearly looking to avoid the MOMMIES MILKIES crowd. 
---
The discord servers for whitemane &amp; fairbanks are quite similar. I may roll whitemane just because it seems like fairbanks may end up horde heavy (at least compared to whitemane).
---
Retail really feels like a sensory overflow. You get bombarded with things the game tells you, you should be doing instead of just do what YOU think it's fun. All those dailies and if you're not doing them, you constantly feel like falling behind. Classic doesn't tell you anything, you'll see better geared people and either want what they have or be satisfied with what you do. No artificial pressure from the game.
---
You’re right Zmuci, show me the way!
---
Everybody has died. Boom, welcome to Naxxramas.
---
Why is it not alright to comment on girls promiscuity but it's alright to comment on a guys sex life?
---
When I logged in to get a name on Herod, I was #10,228 in line. I got into Faerlina immediately. :U
---
remember the 10k people in queue are players fully committed, these aren't the average joe's wanting to scope out the scene, hit level 10 and bail, those are your dedicated fan base, loyalists, players that wanna hit 60, raid and pvp for a good part.
---
Seriously, Blizz, there needs to be at least ONE if not two east coast PVP servers at this point, there's no debate here, otherwise you will scramble for a solution on the first week.
---
you... are really trying to say that print screen and mspaint is better than snipping tool? false
---
not coordinated, but thank fucking god. cannot deal with another LH autismo server.
---
It should be. From what I've read, it should be the more populated non-streamer server. A ton of private server guilds have selected Whitemane as their go-to server.  many others we know are moving onto it based on the fact that
---
Bitch should have sac’d one server to get you your main name. Fucked up
---
If your goal was to avoid high pop you shouldn't be on fae either.
---
&gt;bshout for aggro
---
I thought we already confirmed this only works on the initial application in classic?
---
No 19 is terrible it’s completely one sided , very few classes are viable.  29 is a lot better, but 39 and 49 are kings.
---
I said a few years down the road after launch when pop are less than few thousands people.
---
He doesn't want it
---
I am still thinking about it.
---
I am rolling a Paladin and for healing purpose I need addons for efficient healing methodes.  Currently I am still thinking about sticking to the default UI frame of wow classic which I love and just put in some addons for the sake of QOL improvements.
---
I think eventually I am going for ElvUI which looks very good, has a lot of options and is the addon I was using on my Druid in BFA.
---
&gt; Its because you need VERY high quality gear for survival to be good. we made these guides for the average player who hasn't picked their class yet, for the vast majority of players survival will be a terrible PVE for the lifespan of their character.
---
&gt; hopefully by the time someone is running naxx gear, they would find a far more in depth guide than these :P
---
The funny thing is survival is ACTUALLY the highest dps spec for the entirety of the game. Its all a matter of the amount effort you put into it.
---
r/unexpectedChumbawhumba
---
You can combine the accounts if you wish. Should be instructions in the FAQ on the WoW website. 
---
 I did it myself but contacted support to do it since I couldn't remember my old account name and password. They tracked down the account and merged it with my current one I used for Hearthstone.
---
You must be trolling. You'll be casting frostbolt for 99.9% of boss fight in Molten core. And Lucifron is not an AOE fight. There's only two adds that die in 30 secs ffs.
---
Looking for Ben on Herod. Send me a SS and we'll talk
---
Good thing you got here weeks early to reserve the name Weedman.
---
Possibly: slight looting delay (same as stress tests), very minor dialogue box delay. Usually wont be noticeable in pvp since batching is in place. I played on 90 avg during nilla/bc, never bothered me a bit.
---
Same, some fuck took Legendairy from me.
---
So uh....anyone just *happen* to have a spotify playlist of 5+ hours containing relevant music from early 2000s? Rock focused? :3
---
Been on my list of things to do before launch but hadn't gotten around to it yet.
---
New war inc
---
No wonder with that size.
---
memer server confirmed
---
The queues are bigger, but when it's more than 11k in them it just says "connecting to game server" instead. Only blizzard knows how huge the queue was, but it was definitely fairly large. I was 10min in "connecting to game server" untill I hit no. 11k in the queue, then it used about 7min from there to char creation. If we assume it goes down at equal speeds at all parts of the queue, that's a 26-27k queue. If we assume it goes down faster because people don't actually realize they're in queue it's even more.
---
Don't take my word on this one, it's just the vibe I was getting from a few posts. I'm trying to establish if my impression is true or if I'm making shit up.
---
100% about him making an avatar that looks like him.

Vanilla didn’t have the option to turn xp off, that came in bc/wrath.
---
Once Blizzard figures out what happened, Soda will prolly be banned instead.
---
Now i understand why some people delete comments that get too downvoted.
---
Because troglodytes like yourselves pile up to grind them to the ground, unafraid to be assholes because it’s “approved by comittee”.
---
Use a cencor addon and tag streamer words. Problem solved.
---
I feel the exact same way! I cant put my finger in it! But something about his face that's makes me want to fucking punch it.

I know, but that's the point.

Night Elves are the granola crunchers of Warcraft, so I think it fits perfectly.

The first name I tried was luvstospooge but I didn't get it.

nah that fresh wipes the acc. dont wanna do that, id rather keep it there for the nostalgia
---
Dude this is perfect! I just chose Fairbanks randomly!
---
Dead healer is a dead split 1/3 healer 1/3 tank 1/3 dps imo.  Heal too early or put a hot on for the pull, probably the healers fault.  DPS attack too early and pull of the tank causing confusion and chaos the healer ends up dead probably the DPS fault.  Healer heals normally but the tank isn't doing enough threat on off target throughout the pull that's the tanks fault.
---
how about geeeeezmoooe instead
---
same name , but now pronounced with a comedy fake accent instead.

Please enlight us!

One of the names I reserved was of the person who caused me the most mental anguish in vanilla.

Taliesin is on Zandalar Tribe too from what I've heard.

That's some catch, that catch 22
---
It varies from person to person really, try it out for yourself.
---
If you're a professional gamer or have been in the past I can guarantee that going from 50 to &gt;100 is a big thing.
---
If you feel that you need to ask this question I suspect that you won't feel the actual difference and it will have very little impact on your experience.
---
If you're worried about queues I would immediately reconsider rolling on the realm where the majority of massive streamers are playing. That server's going to be the highest populated one in the world, it's gonna take a LONG time to get in every day.
---
I was pretty amazed that the streamers servers stayed medium pop. It took me less than 5mins to get into Faerlina and make a toon

you wanted opinions don't be salty that they're not positive
---
i think they suck but i'll still group with you and maybe our relationship can grow but your names are still generic and lame.
---
So do we. The more established communities won't be able to hop as easily either, so it'd be very nice for us.
---
Oh, nice. Should be fun times.
---
Spite is too encompassing. There's levels to it.  And I'm an honest healer. I straight up tell people if you pull another pack when I'm not ready I will let you die. They think I'm bluffing and they die. Rage. Then I kick them and find another random dps.
---
Guild is Shadow Pandas, keep an eye out for us!
---
We should have a prediction thread of what the wait times will be on launch.
---
Do you think the population will have a strong burst of people and a quick falling out later? I'm not sure how fast streamers move on from game to game, but I assume their fan base will follow when they move on to the next new game.
---
small dick energy
---
Good to see Hungarian players.

yes you take 375-626 damage to deal 450-751 ddamage TO EVERY ENEMY AROUND YOU. Literally THOUSINDS of damag.

god you are a noob, why post. This is a common fact, that they are used for mass pvp
---
Say what you will, but i see Swolemagg winning this fight. Shazzrah aint got shit
---
Joke is on you, name reservation WAS the stress test.
---
Classic did in general offer very few options for each item slot, which is why even blue trinkets are BIS for many classes until aq/naxx and so on. They added a few items to make it a bit easier to gear up people, so most likely these wont be avalible from the beginning, but I dont know if there is 100% confirmation yet. Benediction drops from MC, but was also added later on, so dont expect them to be avalible.
---
Alot of  people want to roll alliance I reckon as a lot of them switched to horde years ago on modern wow.
---
... yes. A plan which consisted of [blacklisting players](https://youtu.be/wRzJDDxyZqk?t=59). He explicitly said he means to keep them out of good raids. He intends that they never get any good gear. He himself *expressly* called it a blacklist and, yes, bragged that he had the connections to pull it off.
---
Odd, naming myself Beerpussy doesn't seem to work.
---
I managed to get Love, Food and Chubby :D (insert more bragging here)
---
Thalnos IS NOT south American.  Yes a majority of south American players are playing there but they are less than 10% of the current population.  Most of us are from the US.
---
that shit sucks
---
you gonna name your dog bark? or shitsoutside?
---
Fupaslayer, trans woman, FTW!
---
ya i donno i just get pissed by how more and more shit is about how good you emotionally pander to people rather then what you do. I think it's always had a bit of that in the past, but its grown and grown until to what it is today.
---
Streaming as a job isn't a problem by itself, it's just a product of how you make money, and money represents food, housing, basically if you can live. It's just all messed up to me

Blizzard is very strictly against merging servers, ever.

You can read my take on merges here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp80yw/remove_layering_add_more_servers_merge_dead/ewnybhn?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
What many of y’all fail to realize is that blizz also puts your name in the random name generator. So some of y’all are just unlucky. Just in case ya didn’t know
---
&gt; I wish he would just make content and call stuff he sees without going full tilt.
---
Actually agree with you here. He is entertaining right up until he says some super tilted stuff. Hopefully he can dial that back during classic because I do think he is funny and enjoy watching when he is not taking to that level
---
Oh great.  Now I can't play on Herod either?
---
Why are you replying to me tho
---
Hey i remember you we were in a group with a paladin and i was a warrior
---
By cant handle, do you mean the part where there was a queue system just like any other time where an extremely large amount of people logged in at the same time and it worked out exactly as it should have? Sounds like it was a success to me, I logged in 15 minutes after, waited maybe 5 minutes or less with a 2500 person queue. How is that not *handling*.....?
---
Shift + windows + S. There you go. Put into paint and save the file. Then post it to Reddit.
---
Lmao where the fuck are you getting your information?
---
Matching salt and pepper grinders :o
---
✂️✂️✂️
---
Garrosh wasn't added until TBC. Hopefully blizz listens to logic and lets us keep our warchiefs name
---
I think I saw him in Shathrath that one time though..
---
It's a trade-off. Some people will happily sit in queue for a server that is at all times full.
---
Needs more image macros
---
Close enough yeah. I mean, if you reserved a name on a server I imagine that's the server you would then play on
---
im use to it on retail, I will persevere
---
Bro this some real retard shit post
---
It's just people whose lives peaked in 2004-2006 and mostly live off of how great their virtual life in an MMO back then were and they think that with the game coming back they can go back and be awesome instead of facing the fact that they stagnated.
---
Back in my day, we would get 1 maybe 2 crits a week, both up hill.
---
Thankyou so much for the correction, I have just successfully switched it.

He will get reported after he ganks someone and pisses them off and be forced to change it.
---
I was forced to change my name like 4 times, and eventually, they just forced a randomly generated name on me lol.
---
Think it was Uscipibyg.
---
If anyone has or knows anyone with the name Bandos on Herod please message me. I would like to buy the name.
---
Honestly I’m starting to feel the same.
---
I’d rather play with streamers organizing cool pvp events then the ultra hardcore neck beards from this subreddit and pserver on Herod.
---
I hope you have built in Flame Wreath.
---
Haha yeah. :sweats:
---
No. Fuck you
---
I highly doubt it's anything to do with sexism, it will be something in the text that is often used in negative names, or part of the name is locked for whatever reason. It might even be a cultural thing that I'm not aware of, like you can't have Allah etc.
---
East Coast Pvp Servers:
---
Thalnos= Brazilian server
---
Faer= Streamer/spanish server
---
Herod= the only one left.
---
Of course none of this is official and not all people picked because of that, but it's the main reason people are saying they did.
---
What was the other word? Was it princesshit or something?
---
Who is crow on white mane? :-)
---
No twin braid super disappointed.
---
Print screen and paste into "Paint". That's what the pros do!
---
Most of this sub probably wouldn’t be alive or old enough to play WoW if we went back to 2004.
---
Sure killing is still gonna happen in phase 1 but it’ll be far less because no one is getting anything for doing it.
---
 /spit storemount
---
Alright, I'll play.
---
You will never see anyone twice in the game world except on phase 2.
---
You will be incapable of having any community interaction at all.
---
You will get layered approximately every 15 minutes.
---
Classic is ruined :(
---
Not to mention that sweet flaming sword that drops there :)  Dropped for me way back when and I won it over a fellow rogue.  She ran that place 40+ times after, and it never dropped for her.... :/
---
Have fun with the brazillians man.  That would be like rolling a character on Ragnaros or Azralon for BFA.

There was a prominent forum post where one of the leaders of the Spanish coalition said he'd asked everyone to speak English and that they'd do their best to integrate with the community. You try to keep up.

Tbh you should probably poke a hole (two holes makes it drain much easier for air intake and fluid outflow) in the bottom and drain it out. It'll look the same as unopened on a shelf, but less likely to explode.

A million is not that much money anymore. So... one... HUNDRED ... \*checks accomplices expression\* BILLION DOLLARS.
---
I think it's the same without the T. I've seen a website (sadly I've lost it) where you could browse all the restrictions placed on names, and there are a lot of short phrases that are restricted (such as probably "inces") resulting in completely normal words getting restricted as a result. Sadly just a byproduct of the strict filtering.

And it's not like you'll have a choice to play on another German PVP server ;)

Ok.

So what your saying is that horde are butthurt from all the pepper

Because of the term "snowballing".

Probably no cd in cities, once again you don't know shit about how they work, so seriously just stop talking out of your ass

Is this one of those guys you can pay to read a script on camera? Or is he really in this guild?

Heeey, any of you redditors want to help a Nigerian prince with a money transfer? I will pay you back!

At one point it was 30k queue for Shazz.

This happened to me twice. I met a guy who showed me the ropes in Eve Online back in 2009. Helped me win my first dual. Saw that he hadn't been on steam for a long while. Contacted some old guildies and he had died in his early 20s. RIP R7!
---
Flash forward 3 years, and another dude that I met on a MUD game where we played every night for a year straight, trolled people on forums, played other games together, just one day disappeared. I looked on Facebook and found his mother talking about him passing away. I contacted her and he had died in his sleep at the age of 30 for no apparent reason. She said he talked to her long in the night, said I love you Mom, went to bed, and never woke up. RIP Pinion. Miss you brother. 
---
I still look through their profiles on steam every few years, check their screenshots, and remember the things about their lives they told me. It's little things like meeting people that make the internet and gaming such an incredible thing.

BR &gt; LATAM... So not Spanish
---
But prince is okay. That's my confusion.

If its title based why is prince fine?

That would be awful for server balance tbh

They are very popular on Retail, stop spreading misinformation. They might not be top 5, but still way up there.

As a Mt. Dew connoisseur, I can say with certainty that no sparkling water comes close

It's almost as if our president encourages racism.

thank you for the tip was also having the same issue now i can download it

Looking for the name "Asriel", willing to negotiate price!

Define viable for us, if viable to you means you can get through content with the build, then sure it's viable, but a simple respec would move you up 20 places on the damage meter.

I do actually mean to apply it but obviously a SJW would say otherwise. Lol

---
alexensuals stream community is pretty small i wouldnt worry
---
Talk about the most elitist thing I've read on this sub. All because someone wants their name and you are too lazy to right click you want to completely blackball someone? Reduce them down to just a name? They could become your next bestfriend, but because you want to be a jerk you miss out on the community. I'll never understand this type of gatekeeping.
---
I’ve seen that name countless times. Grats on getting it, but its not original.
---
Two of the orc names were taken when I got home. "Ghazghkrull" and "Snikrot".
---
Thankfully Zogwort, Wazdakka, and Zagatruk were open.
---
#WAAAGH!
---
Or I could wait for launch to use my original names and reserve Hope and Grace, which I did yesterday.
---
that 10% too much
---
Its more for the stigma than anything. Also what if there is a god tier player but he doesnt speak english. Things people would like to avoid. I agree itll probably be a non issue for us players. But personally im avoiding it.
---
Yeah, I know these kind of posts are annoying. But I saw that a lot of people started posting these questions so I thought why not? 
---
Maybe I'm lucky
---
I envy your trust in Blizzard. What have they done recently to warrant it? I don't want to wait until live to see how fucked it will be. Vanilla players asked for vanilla, not the modernized version of it because daddy blizz knows best. 
---
The launch is still going to be bad only this time we'll get to deal with layering. I also do not believe Blizzard in the slightest when they state that layering is going to go away after phase 1. There is one non-streamer pvp server for the entire NA east coast. Two for all of EU iirc? How in the hell does layering get removed? Or do they remove it and bring it back for special occasions like the opening of AQ?
---
Also, everyone seems to be overestimating the amount of players that are going to bail out on classic because "it's too hard", like it's some sort of WoW Everest to summit. That, I assume, is where their phase one layering plan comes from. As if a huge amount of the playerbase is going disappear. A vast majority of the people subscribing for classic have never played the content before and they're supposed to leave after the first phase? Lol. Vanilla has a certain mystique that draws you in further and further the higher level you get if you've never played before. I'd wager a lot more people are going to sign up and be retained through phase 1 than they believe. They think they know better, but they don't.
---
At the boring people party
---
If you're rolling PvP 90% of servers will be horde dominant. Usually more balanced with a bit more alliance than horde in normal servers. 
---
RP servers are usually heavy alliance strongholds.
---
Does the "wow diary" explain why blizzard decided that in wow orc males need to have completely hunched backs?
---
Have Beowulf on Faerlina.
---
By can’t handle, I mean a lot of people weren’t able to get past “connecting to log In server” with it being disconnected.
---
By can’t handle, I mean that some people’s position in queue increased rather than decreased once they were in line.
---
By can’t handle I mean that a large number of people who were able to queue were disconnected once making it through.
---
By can’t handle I mean that once a lot people did get through to a server, it ended up not being the server they had selected.
---
By can’t handle, I mean that once a lot of people realized they had been logged in to the wrong server, they were unable to queue for the correct one without being disconnected.
---
By can’t handle, I mean that once a large number of people managed to get through this queue, they were greeted with an error telling them they couldn’t create a character without already having a character there.
---
By can’t handle, I mean that a large number of people who were able to create characters were greeted with an error message stating “error creating character” without any further explanation.

What makes you think Herod is already skewed to the Horde? I’m rolling alliance so I’ll be happy if it’s like 55/45 h/a.

My guess is that still many Russians are going to play in EU servers. As it has always been.
---
Shadow priests have their place and you can find a raid spot if you are selective with your guild or if you wait until people have MC/BWL on farm to start raiding.  
---
Same goes for other Meme specs.  Just know that you might have to heal to run some of the dungeons on your way to 60 and be up front about wanting to dps when you join a guild and you will be good to go.

No time for soulmates , there’s wow to be played !
---
Nah this is correct, it's only because of TA that marks is effective past basic raid equipment for single hunter dps... And even then Surv is stronger in PvP and is the best well rounded spec without spending on respect which only man babies who think their HC do.  And nobody who raids 3 times a week is going to want to swap.  For this reason survival is the alpha spec.

I had to cancel my week-off work due some mortality in the family two weeks ago. I was not sure what to do with this now "free" week and where to switch it on the schedule.

I was on call 24/7 the week Classic comes out but we had to shuffle things around at work a last month, so now Im on call the week before the release :D

I loved to play my human priest on Nostalrius, even when ping comes up with a lot of ppl :D 12k+ on weekends that was some skill needed there to take something down in wetlands .. mostly in murloc's camp ;) :D

If whoever has Darkhero on Herod wants to help me out I’d appreciate it. I’ve been playing under that name since day 1 and would even be willing to buy it from you.
---
With you on skillcap, can't agree with that mechanic being praised.
---
I'm pretty happy with JM, but that's because it's my initials.
---
Actually all three of my name's weren't taken.
---
Two were pretty unique, Maughanster and Greenemech (actually I am saving that name for a friend who is resubbing AT launch)...

But I'm surprised nobody on Pagle took Anillusion

It is risky tho, who knows what blizzard can do for modifing client.

I logged in 3 hours after it launched got all three names I wanted.
---
Good take, let's say you're into Tolkien stuff and want to name your dwarf character after Thorin's father, called "Thrain". 
---
Good name: Þráinn - This is the original spelling from Prose-Edda (where most of the dwarf names, and Gandalf's name are taken from) using Icelandic letters correctly
---
Bad name: Thråín - This is just Tolkien's anglicized name with random accents thrown on top.
---
Are you serious? Jesus Christ this world.
---
Interesting! Separatian nodules are really cool! I also love the rock hammer. Looks like the same one I brought to field camp.
---
PVP servers are usually Horde skewed
---
Well Nazgrim was in WC3. I think there's a middle ground between RP and free for all with names. Important lore names should be off limits.
---
Err, even modest keystones on retail are infinitely harder and more engaging to heal than any five man content in vanilla lol.
---
In BFA they play on Azralon and when you see someone from Azralon is hosting the group you immediately leave.. it's going to be bad.  You don't invite people from Azralon, you don't group with them, you don't talk to them.  98% of them are horrible players.  They leave when one bad thing happens.  They are impatient and they say negative things in broken English.  For a long time I kept saying "they can't all be that bad just give this guy a shot".. I've been burned too many times I hope to never play with another Brazilian player.
---
I'm pretty excited. Gonna play ally on Shazzrah.
---
Well, good luck there mate!
---
Had 3 kiddos (that all love Fortnite) playing WoW the other day and will be playing during release.
---
I don’t like Fortnite and many of the newer games, but I don’t understand the “Boomer” mentality that they don’t like older games.
---
It was frightening to see EVERY realm on NA (aside from the RP and PVPRP realm) listed as high pop only 5 minutes after opening up the servers.  Either everybody who plans on playing classic was counting down the minutes to name reservation time... or Blizzard is going to need to add more realms to accommodate everyone.
---
*Laughs in Guthix*
---
I know the bigger swedish guilds already have that rule reiterated atm.

If you have a particular name in mind that isn't a random 12 letter garble, chances are it's going to be taken, so a lot of people try to reserve it before launch.

---
I think you missed the point of the post a bit, while what you say might be true, the point is that the pacing of retail and classic are very different, and this affects the satisfaction you get from playing.

You're dumb mate. I simply did it in the original game because that's actually how the name I chose is written.

I played a troll mage named Cast in Legion on Draenor-EU (high pop). Was so stocked I got the name, was surprised how rare it was! Jumped into Classic and 'Cast' was taken on every server :(

You realize you don't need to be 60 to kill Rag right? The first guilds will only have a couple people at 60.

Jeez SJWs living rent free eh?

i will play in a pve server, the amount of people in those is good, not to many and not too little, and we still have way more people than role

Anyone who doesn't like building came into fortnite thinking it was a shooter and quickly found out that you can't even beat the worst players without building so they got mad because they wanted a shooter.

Do you have ANY source on this number?

Of course Rap and RP-PVP realms are going to be lower in population compared to PVP and Normal realms. Together, RP and RP-PVP barely make up 5% of the playerbase.

---
I've found the heretic, Brother
---
You're describing a solid 30% no exaggeration of my random healers at low levels.  They literally just don't press buttons idk if they're watching TV or their dog shit on the rug or what but they aren't pressing buttons.
---
Alright, this one I like. An upvote for you my delicious friend.
---
Herod specifically has several posts on the forums requesting that streamers allow it to be a non streamer server. That's all I'm referencing.
---
At least for US only Herod is overpopulated.  Everything else is medium except RP servers which were low.  Doesn't matter how many servers they open if everyone is all deadset on rolling on "the best server" and ignoring the others.
---
This is so sad :( I hope you can eventually get that name.
---
I'm sorry for your loss.

Yoooo good realm choice! I’m with a guild of all dad age guys. We’re planning on doing raids Tuesday and Thursday and just having a good time.

High dps breaks the game. You can 1 tank 4 dps dungeons if your dps is high enough. Or 4 dps 1 heal them. I'm sure you could even 5 dps dungeons in theory, although I've never done it.
---
&gt;All dps have to do is pay attention to threat meters.
---
This kind of thinking is why the vast majority of dps players are terrible at the game.

Undead Shadow Priest is some awesome class/race fantasy. I played a human priest, and Undead Shadow Priests made me want to switch factions on a regular basis. They get the most recongizable (not-fearward) priest spell (Devouring Plague), and of course with skill shadow priests are very tough in pvp.
---
Oof. This actually hurt me for some reason
---
Fits in the 'Spite' category.

Used to paste them into paint because for some reason wow screenshots were in some arcane format you couldn't open without a program
---
Back when I played on Nost my friend (hunter) and I (frost mage) was heading to Desolace at 30ish when we saw stonetalon, you would have difficulty hesitating to mess with them if you saw how many hordes there were, all in one tight package. As a frost mage even.
---
... Then we fought a level 40, headed to the charred vale and got ganged by 10-12 lowbies as we screamed like little girls and laughed our ass off as we got raided by ants.
---
I dunno, I feel bad but you can have a lot of fun with it if you have a decent mindset.
---
nice
---
I'm starting to think playing on Faerlina might even be a better option for me.  Just because I want a high pop server, but not overpopulated.  And I don't think streamers doing streamer things is going to be as much of a problem as people think it will be.

I sure hope so

There's a mob in BRS or BRD that you can mind control that gives you a massive fire resist buff. Only the main tank really needs FR, and even then he doesn't need a ton. 
---
Also, the world record for 60 is a little over 4 days played time, but most expect that to be shattered. Expect to see the guilds gunning for week 1 Rag to get most of their 60s under 4 days played time. You also don't need everyone to be 60. All of your healers can be sub 60, for instance. 
---
If the servers remain stable then I expect to see a week 1 Rag kill.
---
Then how come on the census it has 15%, second to herod? Maybe this sub has an imbalance of rppvp enthusiasts?
---
Blizzard confirmed STDist.
---
Good god thank you for that.
---
It’s true, but it could make up for 10% or less of the server population, so it would likely not be as big of a deal as you might estimate.
---
If the subreddit class polls are anything to go by, druids will still be the least played class in Classic
---
Healer
---
Nice you guys got a discord? I am definitely interested in guilds though it will take me a few months to level.

All three East Coast PvP servers were listed as high population for me when I created my characters. Did that change?
---
PVP would have been my Classic experience.  But I'm no longer into giving $15 a month to be killed, run across the entirety of Arathi Highlands, and find I've been camped.  PVE for me.
---
People goona think you’re a bot.
---
I wanted to pick Ron.. but it was taken on all the servers :(
---
You took a caricature and started to fill in the lines with Asmongold, you don't discuss him at all, you're literally making things up and applying them to a person in post.
---
How do you not grasp that you're just painting a caricature?
---
Top minds say the RP server pops remain stable with a more committed playerbase. Keep in mind, these folks made enough forum noise to get bliz to agree to create an additional rp realm for rppvp. Not an easy feat.
---
Do you have the source by any chance? Thanks !
---
I’ll hit you up after work on here

Haha! Jusus! Lovely copypasta!

---
Willing to offer PayPal, game time, retail gold. DM if you have any of them and are wanting to profit from it!
---
telling people would make the ballance worse because so many beta cucks roll where they have the percieved advantage
---
the active pvp community can vary quite a bit from server pop anyway a 30/70 server can easily have a more active pvpers on the 30% side
---
It is true but there is no dungeon finder so if you say “looking for X for dungeon” and the person doesn’t speak English they aren’t going to respond anyway
---
You won't be doing dungeons or raids with them because you have to communicate to start the group.  
---
Battlegrounds however will be different.
---
1. you can either level completely as enhancement or you can switch from enhancement to ele arround lvl 40 which will make lvling faster but also more mana dependant 
---
2. resto shamans are one of the most sought after class for raids. On horde side they are the most desired healers.
---
They will let you know repeatedly as soon as you get close to them.
---
LF Stalker, Therapist, Stealthy
---
I have 3 names reserved.
---
It still lets me into the character creation screen, so you can still customize and play around with it. Only when you go to create it gives an error that you don't have any slots available.
---
If you already knew that but just lied for the meme, then please disregard and carry on.
---
I got "mementomori" for my undead priest, so ready for this!!
---
I was sitting at the creation screen hitting Enter repeatedly when it flipped from server locked to name unavailable. So, not me. ;_;
---
Not sure if someone got half a second luckier than I did or if the name was on some reserve list.
---
Seems so.
---
That's an example of a bad mechanic if dropping the spoon somehow makes you lose.  That's comparable to l canceling in ssbm which is a shit mechanic.  You always want to do it and it serves no purpose except to artificially increase the difficulty of the game.
---
Building is a wildly dynamic mechanic that 2 years later still hasn't come close to reaching it's full potential.  It rewards speed, accuracy, and strategy.   It creates an absurd number of VIABLE options at any given moment.  
---
It feels like you're arguing in bad faith and know little or nothing about fortnite.
---
Are you suggesting people don't play on PVP servers? Or that Blizzard make more PVP servers?

---
Now that just sounds like a typical Reddit poster in an argument.
---
It will change hands down. Think about it. The people who logged in yesterday are the ones following news/Reddit/ retail hoppers. There are still tons of people out there who won't log in the first time til August 26th.
---
By 1 week into launch every server will be at least medium and with Grob being the only rp-pvp, it'll get high pop pretty quickly.
---
Right now there's tons of drama over faerlina/Herod streamer nonsense and a lot of toxic people rolled on Herod to get away from streamers. A lot of other PvP servers like thalnos are gonna be packed with Brazilian players (non English speakers) and once things settle down I think a lot of people who rolled Herod or thalnos will reroll name or no name because of toxic elitist communities.
---
Grobbulus imo is the safest pick as it was under the radar of streamers/elitists and will probably be a very mature/friendly server.
---
Another great thing about rp-pvp servers is that they usually host great faction balance compared to other servers meaning lots of good wpvp.
---
Queue Battlefield Heroes theme
---
I really dislike the icicles and the weird glowing things around the character that signal when to use an ability for a bonus. Makes it more dynamic but looks like vomit imho
---
lol
---
Lotta rocket league. Some Heroes of the Storm. Might play through Warcraft 3!
---
This is the rough overlook for east pvp :
---
Thalnos = latin america rolling on there
---
Faelina = streamers rolling there
---
Herod = high pop rest of the playerbase
---
HAHAHA.
---
Enjoy being right click to reported by my guild 100 people at a time if you bring politics into chat. Thanks.
---
That server is the reason Classic exists. 
---
I was disappointed that Blizzard didn't name one of their servers for Classic after Nost.
---
Is your print-screen button broken?
---
ur still better off with a pally for dungeons.  u can switch pally to a healer for raids.
---
Priest, Warrior,  Mage, Warlock, Rogue
---
no need to explain heals and tank 
---
Mage and lock can both aoe and cc.  
---
Rogue can unlock the doors and chests
---
Unless you have specific distaste for it, healing is usually as or more exciting than DPSing. 
---
Priest has a great healing toolkit.
---
If you're concerned about not liking how your gear looks, Shadowform helps with that.
---
How about you do everyone a favor and look up any Molten Core speed run from the past 2 years before you flap your gums when it's obvious you don't know shit. The way the Luci pull is done nowadays is they pull the corehound packs between Luci and Mag on top of Luci and aoe everything down.
---
Either brush up on how the game is played in 2019 or don't act like you know shit.

Good choice, im rolling horde because I played Alliance from 04 to 12. It will feel like a brand new experience.
---
There really isn't any other names in the list that are big world of Warcraft icons.  Mankrik perhaps rivals it?  Pagle seems like a nice name to people outside Warcraft and could become popular to friendly people.  Herod just is the most iconic name in the list there.  It is like everyone that picked the server Illidan.  It is hot because it is.
---
Why are you?
---
What would you have them rather do? Stop the devs on WoW to go build make different games so they can build more lore before we are thrust into it with our own character? It's not like they had all that many choice but to wing it. I mean, Cata had tie ins with the original lore anyway since we knew Deathwing was brooding after "losing" when he tried to use the dragon soul on the other dragons. The old gods corruption added on top of it was fitting since he did hide "close" to them. 
---
Pandaria had less strong tie ins but had been asked for by a lot of player. I didn't expect a whole expansion on it but it's what we got. 
---
WoD is where I figure they shoehorned stuff together because some people wanted to return to outland but it would not make sense to just return so they had to build something out of thin air. We got a "what if" story out of it. There is some lore there but it's also detached because the timeline can't really coexist.
---
Anyone who didn't expect Legion to happen was sleeping at the wheel. While no player could confirm it, we "knew" an invasion would happen. There were way too many loose ends related to the burning legion to not have a story arc on it. 
---
BfA to me feels like we are burning what's left of the "fuel" the world of azeroth has to offer. Dealing with the old gods and the naga will leave us looking for what could be next imo. 
---
The lore is still mostly related to what we knew/had from the beginning but it's weaker mostly because we didn't have completely different games to build up connection with some of those characters. Even if you just take Warcraft 3 and it's expansion pack, you have multiple campaign pretty much dedicated to building the lich king lore for example so of course it was better lore to continue that story arc in WoW.
---
only need an active subscription you don't even have to buy the latest expansion
---
you could also literally edit out locked doors and just walk through them like they don't exist. me and my friends were farming Anzu by just walking through the locked door after the last boss, for example
---
Better off?  No.  Acceptable? Sure.  And anyone who levels as a tank is unlikely to want to be a healer.
---
Yep, now we just need an intern at Blizzard to sneak into the server rooms late at night and "accidentally" flip the launch button.
---
Who's up to the task?
---
Maybe I’ve just grown up a lot since 2006 but is rape still a “funny” word?
---
But most of my work involves EBCDIC and bashing my head against hard coded tables written 30-40 years ago. You do not know the joy of having your work readable on a windows computer. I should be allowed to use any character set I want.
---
True, but while this improves the undead looks, it makes the rest of the game much worse, as you also get the other chinese specific graphics and restrictions. I don't think it's a worthwhile trade.
---
When you get to 60 then what?
---
Children just make it even shorter! I'll be running at probably 5-8 hrs per week if I'm lucky. So I guess 8 months to 1 year for me if I'm able to stay with it for that long. 
---
Other gaming options always pop up as well as the quick fix when you only have 40 minutes of free time. Hard to get into a WoW session with less than 1-2 hours, especially if you're doing a dungeon. I remember older dungeon attempts running for hours on end at the beginning. 
---
No end-game raiding for me this time around I suppose. Jeez, pushing AQ40 and Naxx in vanilla required full time commitment. Days of raiding, and the rest of the week spent farming mats/flasks/prep.
---
mmmeeiiiisssttaaaaaaaaaa
---
I'm sure casting CoC and fire blast on MC bosses is a good use of mana. Without stating the losy of dps :)
---
We are saying the amount of people on the server will be large. Read my whole comment.
---
Every time I see one of these, I'm wondering if the uploader has the mental capacity to tie their own shoelaces.
---
Do we have stats on server balance yet with the names created?
---
See, I'm saving 7 bucks and just playing 'hardmode' when I pick my name at launch.  I will have to flex my creativity beyond everyone else, is all.
---
There use to be one in classic.
---
Välfärd

I didn't realize how shitty this subreddit could get until the entire front page is full of screenshots of names. Like who gives a shit?
---

pallys do all the aoe pulls, if you want to dungeon efficiently you can't be waiting for warrior to get threat on individual mobs

Hello, I’ll have a waffle cone with two scoops of salt and one scoop of cringe. Thank you.
---
What a muppet.
---
So salty right now... Thought it would be safer to redesign my classic characters before launch. Deleted the character and boom, the name is now unavailable. It wasn't even a common name as well, had accents and everything. Had to be a bot... FML
---
Triggered
---
I got my main name and 2 dark souls names, Tarkus and Kaathe. Was really hoping to get some warframe names like, Nekros for my warlock or Inaros for a rogue but they were taken.
---
Thanks for the comment, saving that for later &lt;3
---
Working in 'IT' I don't really see much difference in the technical competence of the various age groups, the only real difference is older people are more likely to admit they have no idea what they are doing.
---
I hope to see a guild that worships our Lord and Mutator Grobbulus! 
---
So pumped for this server!!!
---
I tried Princess and got the same error..
---
We (German) ~10 People picked Golemagg.
---
Happy cake day Thex!
---
shit realm
---
I have two ten page papers due the weekend before launch. Timing is perfect though, took a week of leave to play classic when it drops. Playing bfa here and there, leveling destro is fun
---
Isn't Towellie that full-blown retail vape guy?
---
Is he really going to commit to classic?
---
Most dungeons have humans and beasts.
---
That's just the build number. i.e. how many times the exe was built from source. So, at most, it means Classic took more tries to get right than current WoW. :P
---
If you're playing in a 90 IQ troglodyte guild yeah, maybe. [This](https://youtu.be/QbqFQNeWLTU) is what a modern MC run looks like bud.
---
This isn't even launch night.  This is just people waiting in line outside the store for two weeks trying to keep their spot in line.
---
Yeah that's what I figured.  The problem is, if layers *aren't* super sticky that exacerbates a lot of the problems with immersion and community.  Kind of a catch 22. Thanks for the discussion!
---
I wonder what im thinking of in Wrath.  Hrm...  Were there some turn-ins?  Am i thinking of some commendations you could buy with badges or something?
---
Netherwing was definitely nice.  I did that one in mid-Wrath, and i'd see some people flying around for eggs, but usually not too many, or i'd have it to myself.  Got that one done pretty quick.
---
Yeah you spec down to shadow weaving then rest goes into holy. You mindflay rank 1 to stack it then you heal. Cast mind blast to keep the debuff up then back to healing. You dont get shadowform
---
Thanks I'm here all week.
---
Doesn't work unfortunately. Some file or something must be tagged "yes this is a real logged character, enable settings", I've tried to search the different lua and config files. Couldn't find anything.
---
Idk tho cause there is a difference between a login server que and a paly server que, I assume we will all still be sitting in ques for the first week no matter our server choice.
---
if you log in day one and its hard to communicate hop on a different realm....  EZPZ
---
Best 2.49 I spent on YouTube. I'm just gonna stick this on loop in the background and live out my childhood of pulling all nighters for the first time playing on my laptop on my couch in the living room, with this episode playing. c:
---
I'm finding that what starts out as hooks and bait to keep you playing turns into obligation and frustration as time goes on.
---
Instead of logging in because you want to do the dailies, you log in because you don't want to *miss* the dailies.  Same activity, same end result, totally inverse feeling to it.
---
I am looking for to classic simply because if I "miss a day"... it's okay.
---
Reddit rumor mill is yes, and when I say that people are just assuming that because 15 ot more latin guilds are going there. Person in another thread said they would be surprised if they were a quarter of the server. I have zero issues with this, also being lower pop with no streamers is great. Time will tell but me all the guys at my work and a bunch of friends all reserved there.
---
[Hmmmh...](https://i.imgur.com/g94wiJT.png)
---
True i forgot. Especially good for tanks because of bonus armor
---
I know a lot of people created characters today because they had work and couldn't stay up.
---
Still, all it means is that the amount that logs in at the same time to create characters isn't high enough to mandate a queue.
---
Get the fuck out of the discord
---
Me and my friends are playing on Golemagg, the dutch!
---
That kinda sucks! And sorry about your loss! :( Condolences

Fortunately, as an insurance broker I work 9-5 and booking time off isn't a problem :D

---
Well done brother
---
After 25 years of gaming, I can honestly say that Vanilla WoW was hands down the most enjoyable and the most fun I have ever had playing a video game.
---
Be sure to find a group of individuals online you have fun playing with. Making friends with strangers on wow is just a whole experience in itself. I personally enjoyed the RP server I was on because in general people tend to love it and be nicer.
---
Very few things in gaming compare to the camaraderie and sense of accomplishment achieved from downing raid bosses with 40 people coordinating together to make things click.
---
Warlocks, shit just dots you up and cant doe because double sac.
---
Also hunters can be super anoying if they open on you.
---
&gt;  a lot of them are stupid.
---
Actually, none of them are "stupid", that one's allowed!
---
Warrior Hunter mage rogue and shaman/pallly/priest
---
Same faction. 
---
Also, it was incredibly obvious that they were rolling on shazzrah if you’ve literally ever seen them before.
---
I'm a Zandalar guy and were the least populated outta anyone. Atleast we won't be as hard hit by layering but I expect all the servers to fill up on launch.
---
Why would I do all that and capture multiple monitors and a bunch of excess information? I just want the names.
---
Rookies!
---
From what I understand it's going to be up until release
---
Dungeons also have undead, dragonkin, elementals and mechs.
---
then you respec?
---
Then don't
---
They only have 2 reject messages either it's taken or its mature content filter which includes anything they don't want you using.
---
Burn. It. Down.
---
I thought you might be lol. I've just have had that actually happen to me before in vanilla so many times, so it was a bit of a sore spot.
---
Thank you for doing this! Those of us who are big nerds with attachments to our characters appreciate you!
---
Thanks man :) &lt;3 
---
AAayyyy I work with insurance too, project manager for a water mitigation firm :P
---
I'm looking for Bo, Boo, Blackout, and Fade on Herod.
---
That's a great fucking question, Sir.
---
i was in a 10k queue but it only took 5 mins to get in.
---
&gt; Not talking about being the BEST or even viable really, but just for fun. I feel like over the next few hours I'm going to be on a gear calculator trying to figure out what would be the best combo.
---
the 20/31/0 is calculated as the highest achievable dps for a shaman assuming the necessary effort is put into it.
---
Someone, mystifyingly, already took my go-to name 'Spasmolytik"
---
There was an executie on my first realm. Neato.
---
The two names i wanted are kinda common but im surprised they both were taken in the first 10 minutes. Missed out on Tunes and Swoop. Im more surprised Tunes went before Toons.
---
Agreed, but why same faction? Does it just negate a lot of the bullshit that you have to put up with?
---
God how my musical tastes have changed in 15 years.....
---
Did someone say Benoit?
---
So they weren’t original then?
---
Haha, sadly no. We’re on Herod with, well, everyone else.
---
I'm sorry - She :) Crazy how I always just assume gender in this reddit but it is difficult to try and get it right or be neutral :3 No h8 plox
---
Im sure you can't do stalin or hitler but you could do Mao, Mussolini and polpot
---
Having to memorize every little pull.
---
Having to rush to beat a timer.
---
Getting the same key for weeks in a row for the shittiest dungeon.
---
Not playing a meta class that has a short interrupt, purge, etc baked into the class
---
All the skips/managing what to pull.  Especially annoying as a pet class.
---
Having to run the same damn dungeons the entire xpac.  I like being able to 'graduate' from instances (until i decide to make an alt)
---
Dungeons are a relaxing time to see some unique places, kill some dudes, hang out with some friends, work toward a goal (even if it means wipes, and then figuring out how to not wipe again) and just relax.  M+ is the direct opposite of that in every way.
---
Combine that with the fact that an already toxic community thanks to the dungeon finder becoming even more toxic thanks to the 'rush rush' mentality and i just have zero desire to do them.
---
Thanks guys! I’ll try it later today. I just want to add a beard and change skin tone before I’m locked in for good.
---
What makes yours any different from the million other "guides" currently available?
---
Mage would be best for roots and cc in world pvp, Warlock would be best for summoning tha squad to dungeons.  
---
Both Lock and Mage have good CC and AOE
---
Nice. I have Mackenzie on retail for a gnome rogue.
---
The only problem with Fairbanks is that it has a sizable Faction imbalance according to the surveys. Like 60-40 H-A
---
If that doesn't get corrected, imbalanced servers tend to suffer from a feedback effect and wind up 80-20,and then the server dies.
---
If you don't want to compete against each other for loot as often then having a rogue or shaman as the 3rd would be ideal. Plus, shamans complement warriors really well and can help heal if the priest is having troubles.
---
Im running a guild. So recruiting people, finishing up a spreadsheet ive been working on which includes pre raid BiS and specs for raid per class, along which where each formula drops for blacksmithing alchemy enchanting etc. Basically things to keep me busy and provide information easily to the guild so i dont get 60 pms a day about gear or specs.
---
you should be able to name yourself Jaina, not sure about Elune, but it's worth a try \^\^
---
Screenshots weren't rare in 2004.  Print Screen + Paste into paint has been around for as long as there has been a GUI.

What was rare in 2004 were people taking cell phone pictures of their monitors.

Who said tourists can´t be streamers?
---
heh take a screenie with your future husband
---
Will hardly be a problem. Blizzard has stated, that the language in public chats must conform to the language designation of that particular server.
---
Forget being the first dungeon for many in WoW, Deadmines is the first dungeon run EVER in any mmo for a lot of people. 
---
Plus pirates and when you finally get thru the cave and to the water and the ship its like that Goonies type moment.
---
LF Masterlink on Thalnos!
---
You can just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around. Or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters
---
This helped me a lot before the queue yesterday!
---
If you're spamming the dungeons as a levelling technique having to gear four of the same class would border on irrelevant. You're going to run the dungeon so many times that either everyone gets what they want or they aren't keeping bad equipment for long.
---
Looking for: Zero Bones Nasty - on Whitemane. Will make it worth your time!  Hit me up.

&gt; Pony tail 
---
What does that mean? (I don't go on reddit very often.) I assume it's about the pigtail hairstyle but I am not sure.
---
Really? Quite a few people do. Asmon is big, but you can't be into classic without knowing about Alexensual
---
If you gank with twitch prime you're actually helping them make money.
---
So why did they suddenly decide to play faerlina instead of herod?
---
It's that szn
---
Ah yes. East coast. I'm on West coast. But dam, would have been such a good screenshot
---
Why is this so accurate????
---
I can't tell if that persons post history is real or trolling.
---
Saw some pretty cool ones on this sub actually lol.  But ya this is accurate
---
I hope there is “Bacon” on the Horde side and you two become the worst of enemies, in a good way.
---
selling GJ and fefe on herod
---
My greedy little heart hopes they add more servers, that classic is massively successful, that all of the good things about vanilla are captured and all of the mistakes that followed are never repeated, an we all wind up in a place where we can play through our favorite expansion on dedicate servers until the end of time...
---
But the reality will probably be very different.
---
&gt;So it comes down to Login queue times or half Spanish population.
---
The LA/SA countries largely speak Spanish, Brazilians speak Portugese.
---
The language barrier will be even worse than you think, I'd say Thalnos would be worse to play on than Faerlina.
---
Yeah.  They're good for pvp too.  Hunters, however, kind of fall off after BWL.  They.kind of plateau in regards to damage output and will be replaced by fury warriors.in AQ and Naxx.
---
A hunter is a great character to have for it's farming ability.  A hunter could financially support the rest of your characters.
---
Jay Mmmm
---
The joys of adult responsibilities haha 😅 we make the most of it!

Once people hit lvl 30-40 and begin the real lvling grind you'll see a huge drop in playerbase.

---
Yes pigtail...I was wrong and referenced the incorrect hairstyle
---
How to queues impact sharding? Are there a finite number of shards for a maxed out population? So many questions haha
---
I´ll take quality over quantity
---
What kind of rules? When I see someone rping I will still gank them. Its part of the rp that unsafe zones are unsafe
---
Got Russell and Edi on Herod. Both my dogs lol
---
whatever the price is double it
---
You also need to be specced into improved sap for a 90% chance not to get immediately wrecked by other mobs in a group
---
Layering allows more people to play at the same time and prevents server crashes due to high traffic.
---
Where can you check?
---
Still one of the best South Park Episodes.
---
I should watch it again.
---
Yeah I managed to snag the names, Nick, Sam and Luke. All of our real names :)
---
You gotta change that poop on Survival for dungeoning. As a tank I care way more about whether the hunter has Trap Mastery than I care about their dps.
---
Well now I have to go watch the episode again!
---
Iol is mine!  (looks like lol with the in-game font)
---
Makes no sense, pvp is more popular by far.
---
lol wow so cool.
---
Two letter names are possible. There are only 676 of these if you leave out non-ASCII characters. Some of these like HK for honorable kill, QQ for meme value etc will be highly sought after. Some people want to be recognised and also potentially for multiple characters to be recognised as belonging to a particular account. Having certain names reserved for themselves is worth some effort.
---
I also like giving my characters names that would make sense lore-wise in the games universe, but not everyone thinks like that.
---
Completely missed the point of this thread
---
You muppet!
---
Schism is my favorite song of all time. Nothing has ever surpassed it in 18 years.
---
Even if I ding 60 on my main char relatively quick for Classic, i'll still have at least 2-3 alts to get levelled anyways. And professions i'll need to level as well. Not gonna be bored very soon heh.
---
I am not a partner yet... Still need a couple of years to get that ;)
---
Considering this place sometimes reaches Boston Legal insanity levels, I am surprised they even noticed :)

Got my orc warrior named Ugluk. Looks like meat’s back on the menu, boys!
---
LF Science, pst for more info.
---
2500? Think you missed a 0 there mate. Way more people played on Vanilla servers simultaneously than 2500.
---
East coast got shafted imo and I think Blizz should open up a new east coast pvp server.
---
Faerlina - unofficial streamer server
---
Thanos - unofficial Brazilian and Latin American server
---
Herod - looks to be a very high pop server at the moment
---
Any east coasters feel the same way?  My crew is leaning towards Grobbulus or a west coast server unless something changes.  I will be very disappointed if a new east coast pvp server doesn't open up before launch.
---
What if you use adolf instead of hitler?
---
It's not the inces, I confirmed it.
---
I tried to make a character on classic named "Inces" but was met with full characters, I then tried to make a character named "Fuck" and was met with the mature language notification, so it wasn't because my character slots was full and that showed up first.
---
Got the name “Who”. Looking forward to Who is the tank jokes!
---
Its actually for a good friend of mine haha, i got one of the names I really wanted but she unable to get either of hers! We checked every single server even the RP ones to no avail :(
---
So there's actually more than two things that matter to you!
---
Rogues are actually more welcome in most groups than Shadowpriests. Unless that shadow-priest is willing to heal despite their spec, that is.
---
Look up RP realm rules, they differ to normal realms. Quick example from the top of my head is something as simple as character names.
---
Any info about faction balance on this server? Only recently decided to do this server but haven't been paying much attention
---
I think I got those in Minecraft
---
can’t tell if you’re serious with this. Why would a two letter name be cool?
---
That would be great. When they're such a group of trolls that when they tell the truth no one believes them and it acts as a bluff that brings the people who want to avoid them to them lol
---
dont make me cry man

The private discords of both Tribe and Monkeynews has stated Golemagg, and even talked about not getting their names on those servers. Hydra has on his stream mentioned 100 times to his subs and even mods about going to Golemagg, and joining APES. Guzu reserved his name on Shazzrah, but was not completely sure if he was playing there and then mentioned that some streamers + Apes was gonna play on Golemagg.   
---
So, all in all we cant be 100% sure, but at least Hydra seems pretty genuine to his stream about going Golemagg.
---
Have you braved the Fargo Deep Mines? I hear they are infested with Kobolds.
---
I like the idea a lot, but I would never touch classic and add something that wasn't there... that'd the point of classic imo.
---
Have Critler looking for Owlcapwn on Herod
---
I you are allowed to use chinese models, which require a file modification. I'm pretty sure you're allowed to swap a language pack.
---
Especially with such uncreative names...
---
Ironically, we were is discord debating a potential last minute switch to west coast because we had been hearing Herod was going to be overloaded. Oh what might have been....

---
This has mostly been answered already, but no, paladins were not viable tanks in vanilla. They were excellent healers, however, and in fairly high demand for raids because of stacking pally buffs.
---
Also note that leveling a paladin is FUCKING ANNOYING in classic. You will literally be relying on autoattack for most mobs. Extremely slow.
---
LFMoms
---
Lol you do realize he already had the name reserved?...sucker born every minute
---
Jajajajajaja

Let’s get the Dutch onboard too and we are good to go!
---
Buying "Fel" on Herod, have some names to trade or can pay gold/USD. Discord: Felorea#1821, bnet Felorea#1549, or DM here.
---
Best name I had was Dahmer as an undead priest. Had em since vanilla. As the years went on I got more and more scared of playing him and getting reported.
---
There is something called tri spec for priest but it is for pvp. You get silence in shadow tree.
---
17-11-23
---
You can have more or less points in shadow weaving, I prefer 19-11-21 to get inner fire.
---
It is a very offensive pvp build that works well on alliance side since paladins are the official defensive healers/dispel for them.
---
https://i.imgur.com/OdkSj5D.png
---
Probably not. I’d expect them to let 20-25k people in at launch, just with an absurd number of layers. But I’m sure they have to stop adding layers and put queues in at *some point*. 
---
My ideal situation with what we’re getting is: Servers open, 20k people can join, and anything past that is a queue. As days go by, there will be less and less layers and the total cap will shrink, to inch closer to the eventual goal of around 3-5k players. 
---
So even *with* layering, id expect a queue. Even though I’ll be there at launch, mashing the enter server button, I fully expect to wait in queues for 3-5 hours and I won’t complain.
---
Trying to whisper someone he'd literally just ignored...
---
Yeah. It's "Who's" as in who is... Oh dear
---
Herod is just a PVP server. Grobbulus is the RP PVP server.
---
Anyone has Banks on Shazzrah?:(((
---
You can tank 5 mans and UBRS, but anything beyond is a hard road. 
---
Ony is actually a decent option because you can pick up whelp aggro pretty well, though usually they seem to just be kited / AOEd by mages so you might even just be a drain on healer mana to let them all be hitting you.  
---
MC also has plenty of adds in some fights so you can be just as effective an off-tank as anyone else, but you go OOM rather quickly so you have to know whether you have to blow all your mana on threat spells quickly or whether you are like 2nd, 3rd, 4th in the kill order so you can sit back and let your holy shield/judge righteousness build up threat more efficiently.  Consecration builds some threat too but is much more inefficient.
---
Is there an addon to remove the timer? I looked into options but I couldnt find any way to disable it. Also when playing with randoms (and friends) they often stress out about it. The timer changes the feeling of doing dungeons, it feels forced and artificial, not helped by the linear and samey design of modern wow. How you can possibly argue that sunken temple and BRD are more repetetive than bfa dungeons I dont know.
---
How can we know the servers are dead before they have even been open? From what I understand the low,medium,high displaying on the servers now just reflects the number of people on creating characters and not the number of people who have actually signed up.
---
On a bloody battle field with the sundered bodies of Delbert, Clyde, and Maurice lying at my feet.
---
that's a pretty epic pvp group for horde.  good luck Faerlina alliance.
---
it's moreso just the unfortunate circumstance that us normie americans are not exposed to people from those countries much, and 7/10 times when we are they are terrible at the game and unwilling to communicate. sure its wrong but most people can't help it.
---
Absolute clusterfuck, and theres no main monitor centered towards the keyboard? Do you keep your head tilted to the side all the time?
---
Speed runs are the only way to be competitive when world firsts no longer matter.  
---
With the exception of Molten Core and Onyxia which will be world firsted once enough poop sockers hit level 60 all of classic's world first, second and third kills etc. will occur within minutes or even seconds of each for each new raid release.
---
Experienced guilds will still employ strategies like stacking trash packs on top of bosses or sending hunters ahead of the raid to pull mobs early on. It'll just be slower because of gear levels. The fundamental strategies are still sound, it'll just be slower.
---
Hi, /u/DSPerks
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cptxp0/does_anyone_know_if_the_enchanted_moonstalker/). 
---
I don't think that the "authentic server" record will be very applicable since players know a lot more and play a lot better now than they did 13 years ago.
---
If we look at private servers, I believe the record is still approximately 9.5 days from ND, but maybe a newer server has beaten that.
---
A few things to consider though - players are going to take Classic even more seriously and there will be a lot more guilds gunning for world first Rag. Also the content is generally easier than it is on private servers.
---
This could easily cut the time down to 7-8 days or less depending on just how easy Molten Core is tuned. That 9.5 day record was set by a raid team that was wearing mostly greens and not even completely level 60 yet, so it's possible that we see an early kill by a level 55 raid force or something.
---

Atiesh, and how does the sound of the word matter? And "Pagle" is a horrible sounding word. At least "Atiesh" sounds awesome when you say it. It's smooth, sexy, and fun. "Pagle" sounds harsh, and annoying.

John whispers: Invite me and Freddy
---
Guess which duo I'm going to invite. I've had this happen loads before with either untypable or childish names. 
---
Sure I'd tell people to let their friend whisper me if it was for something unpopular but if you're making a UBRS/MC/BWL Pug and you're getting a lot of whispers then the decision is easy.
---
I love Brazil and Brazilians, have been there many times and would go back even though I got shot in the shoulder during a robbery on the beach during the 2014 WC.
---
But I don't want to play games with them - my general experience encountering them in WoW and other games has overall been a negative one. 
---
Sure, they don't all meet the stereotype and I always reserve judgement for the individual, but there will be enough bad eggs on Thalnos to make sure I never play there.
---
I didn't get the only name I cared to reserve... 
---
If you got Rakara on Herod-PvP, please DM me. 
---
That was my brother's character name from beta all the way until his death in 2016. I'm willing to compensate you for it. I just want to roll a copy of his character and log out in his favorite place.
---
Lol I'm glad im not the only one. 
---
OP it looks great but my OCD was also triggered.
---
sure they can
---
Says the guy who pays for 3 accounts, just so he can get the names lmfao
---
Yes. I have the same name saved on two servers. Guildmates have done the same.
---
It happened to me too.  I got Deathwish on my undead warrior... on the wrong server
---
Hub'tok!
---
Kinda funny to me this guy thinks you haven't planned any of this out.
---
Weird link flex but ok
---
Implying every single person that uses a computer also knows the knows how to type accented characters or even guranteed has a numpad on their keyboard.  
---
By the sounds of it, I wouldn't group with you either.
---
It tipsout
---
 Looking for the name Alias on Pagle, I have no alternate names, don’t make me use special characters. Let’s work out something please. I have Alias on Mankrik. Will gift a 6 month sub.
---
Got Colossus on Herod
---
shadowform isn't bad at all, nice! I tried to get Shadow and was obviously not gonna happen :)
---
That's because the private servers wasnt true copies of vanilla
---
How would duo leveling affect the times tho? Like pala war or druid hunter
---
Would it be a increased by a large margin?
---
I got Mariah, human pally, and Flatline orc rogue :)
---
You can tell by the way it is
---
It doesn’t mention an end date because there’s not an end date.
---
Herod took a stance and claimed their own server.
---
Yup that sums up how I felt. Once I realized I kept logging in to do shit I didn't want to do because I would be missing out on rep/conquest/ilvl I stopped playing. Can't wait for classic, such a better game.
---
If I remember correctly most of not all EU servers are safe - as most streamers are US based or rolling on US servers. People were saying yesterday how lucky EU has got it for that reason.
---
 Thanks for the post, much love from us.  
---
 As a brazilian i understand the hate towards our country, we have a lot of trolls indeed, but as harowkun said they are very LOUDER!!! And it make a bad rep for the rest of us.  
---
 I dont really like the way this is going, but its fine, avoid Thalnos and move on, in the end is blizzard fault, they know about us.
---
Furthermore a  humble request... as a man i get very offended when some crazy feminist came to me saying that all man are potential rapist! I am not a rapist god dammit, I dont like someone pointing a finger to my face for actions of other man, so pleaseeee, want to avoid Brazilians? go ahead, just dont say this much shit about all of us like we all the same mind.
---
They all decided to follow me to Faerlina.
---
If more servers aren't added, yes short term with layering. Long term it's going to be a slow burning disaster of new servers, people jumping ship, and server transfers.
---
You know, those things layering apparently was going to prevent? See people love to talk up Blizzard and their divine knowledge. They're hyper conservative quantitative analysis paralysis victims. We're going to see a surge of people coming out of wood works that didn't sub for stress or character reservations. More of my friends are coming back day one that aren't on blizzards radar but played vanilla here and plan to do it again.
---
I'm still trying to pick a funny name for my rogue if anyone has any good suggestions feel free to drop them here.
---
Do people not know about snip tool at this point? Why are we still taking pics of our monitors??
---
role playing as delusional!  inventive!
---
According to a recent rumor, Ninja, Towlie, and Dr. Disrespect are all rolling Alliance on that server....oh boy.
---
&gt; A feral druid, ret pally, and enhancement shaman all walk into a bar..
---
&gt; The bartender asks them, "Which one of you can do the most damage?"
---
&gt; "It is I", says the feral druid. "For i am basically a rogue and everyone knows that speed wins the fight"
---
&gt; "No, no, it's I" says the paladin. "I am basically a warrior but better, blessed with the holy power, my mighty sword wins the fight"
---
&gt; Before the two have a chance to duel, the shaman 1 shots both of them.
---
&gt; "..Sorry, I thought I walked into a casino."
---
If you are legitimately curious, assuming equal skill-buffs and not undead: feral are top, followed by spelladin/enh shaman competing for seconds spot.
---
Agreed. Why the hell would people share something they're happy about with a community of people experiencing similar things? Like, where would you even do that? Dumbasses.
---
Yeah me too as well as my own family which some of them were killed in WW2. nonetheless i don't speak shit, its just as i said, it was once germany and that's literally what i mean. of course it was occupied, still it was germany, no matter how you roll the dice.

The thing in classic is that everytime you respec the cost ramps up until 50 gold.
---
That means that you either play so much that you can afford that cost, decide for one thing or settle with some compromise.
---
In that sense it's easier for classes that only have one role.
---
Lol out of curiosity which 5?
---
What? There’s literally never an instance in MC where you’d use AoE. Single target is always going to be faster and more mana efficient.
---
No, and I'd the servers are capped I wonder if they can even make chars on launch.
---
Exactly! You aren't wrong! That's what I hear when I say it as well.
---
Who is he falling behind? What content is there he cannot access? In Classic molten core is still done when naxx is out. He wont try to join bwl raids with green gear, he will instead join mc groups. Did you forget that guilds still progress through mc 6 months after release? Everyone has something to do. You dont play the patch, you play the game.
---
r/eu4 feels your pain and sends its best wishes. It will never go away.
---
Yup, starting nodes are there
---
Holy moly.  I was looking for stuff to watch from that era during the grind.  Totally forgot about that one.
---
I've already got Red vs Blue and Ventrilo Harassments on the list.
---
Oh dam I thought the name was unique for all of classic.
---
Hate ? I only say this name is terrible.
---
You're crazy.
---
So in Classic there won't be any gathering nodes, right?

Woahhh Nelly. Easy boy easy.

It’s not like that on live, why would it be like that here?

We had that one some hours ago.

Herod is the most popular pvp est server.
---
No, the stress test was your only chance to set it up before launch.
---
You mean we’ll be living it.
---
&gt; Nah man rets do shit tier dps so shit that they do even less than your non powershifting non mcp druid.
---
nope plain wrong.
---
Ah ok, I thought that was the joke, that he bait and switched to Herod to screw us all.
---
Looking for "Drk" on Herod
---
I'm going to have to check this out. My wife is playing for the first time (priest), so I may be going a little slower leveling with her. But I know myself (war) and two others (lock,druid) would be interested in the casual core group. Two of us played through bwl and one through naxx. I'll have to reach out on discord. Thanks for the info.
---
In the fury of getting my name reserved, I attempted to connect to Herod, but was defaulted to Myzrael. Without looking, I created my characters and got the 3 names I wanted: Five, my real life name, and Zaz.
---
It wasn't until about 5 minutes later I realized I was on the wrong server. So I tried to get over to Herod.  
---
The queue was \~10 minutes by this time, and once I finally connected and tried to make my characters, I forgot to delete my 3 characters from the other server. So I had to switch back.
---
When I tried to connect to Herod again - I was defaulted to Myzrael... again...   
---
I expected the servers to be shit - but this was fucking unreal trying to get on Herod. Later I found out that streamers were going to Herod and their fanbois were doing the same.
---

What the fuck is this? Pixelated excrements from 2010?
---
I already had three accounts on retail. Thanks wow tokens!
---
This one is the best. Well played sir or madam. Well played.
---
&gt;There's no endgame for casuals
---
This is just so untrue, and I mean that in the most optimistic way possible. Every raid minus Naxx/AQ40 are going to be puggable during the patches they come out, and raiding before AQ40 barely requires more than raidlogging. Gearing up for raids can be done in like 20-30 hours of gameplay, aka a good 2-3 weeks for most of my p-server friends who were also parents/employed.
---
You probably won't be doing raids the patch they come out if you are truly casual, but you will 100% be able to pug MC, Ony, AQ20, ZG, and later on BWL, in sessions of 3-4 hours max. If you're in a guild, those raids are all 1-3 hour raids at most, so you can cram a lot of them into like, 10-20 hours total gameplay a week.
---
If you wanna push AQ40/Naxx or do content right when it comes out then you definitely need to play a lot, but I think if you can only play a couple hours a day (not counting a bit of a rush at launch like I assume most will be doing), you can still hit 60 and gear up for MC within like 4-6 months without rushing, and that's a very conservatively slow estimate.
---
Source: Dad, sysadmin, AQ40 p-server raider :p GRANTED, it does require either being able to keep a schedule for a guild, or sit down a bit longer with pugs, but I was barely playing 20 hours a week including herbalism at work during slow hours (lol). We barely raided 8 hours a week.
---
Lmao you could have done a minute of research and saved yourself a lot of trouble
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
Also a Wrath Baby but with some playtime in TBC.

Stresstest was great. I'm ready.

Some of us are bilingual and happen to work in the states or Canada. Sorry bout that! My druid is named bjøern which means bear in danish.

obviously doc &amp; ninja are a troll but seems accurate for the rest
---
even BC had dailies with, Netherwing, Ogri'la and the skaxis but the game was still much like its original self.
---
I was **He** through all of Retail on high-pop servers like KT and Emerald Dream. I didn't want it here, but at least it's an actual word instead of "Uq" or whatever he has.
---
Yeah, actually. That zone is Nagrand, and there’s a quest there to literally click on pixelated excrements. There’s actual pixelated excrement in the pic.
---
Fairbanks was the only high pop server I saw yesterday. It probably adjusts depending on how many people are making names at that time lol
---
Yes, they are working to have console-port and wowmapper ready for classic by launch. The creator, Munk, is working on it in his spare time but it will be ready by release. Huge demand for it.
---
When have you ever thought Activision has had CS, let alone one to take pride in?
---
Do you know if the Moonstalker Cloak works outside of Darkshore in Classic?
---
I too am horde on that server, undead, see ya on the 27th!
---
Some of the stuff APES pulled on pservers isn't going to work or fly in Classic. I don't really have a problem with them, but there is a tinge of toxicity in their attitude. Combine that with them generally being good at PVP and playing all the fucking time and you get what most people agree is a guild to avoid.
---
 LIGHT GRANT ME ONE FINAL BLESSING!
---
I heard Dustin Diamond is playing on the Korean server
---
Brazil is mostly Hordie-PvP with some Ally-PvE...
---
Lol APES is just a hardcore raiding guild like any other raiding guild. They don’t wreck the server - but they are usually the most geared and progressed raiding guild at any one time. 
---
This in turn gives them significant power over world objectives - like world bosses etc. 
---
So they usually take priority because they can’t be easily stopped like less geared/organized/inexperienced guilds. 
---
This happens on every server - APES is just well known for the past few private servers and will obviously continue on in classic.
---
Infectious is tight as

I think the problem is that they *are" sending their best.

---
I agree. Xenophobia is pretty evident in a lot of these posts. There are trolls and griefers everywhere, regardless of nationality. Using “Brazilians are trolls” as a reason to avoid a server is ridiculous. Also, people who are concerned with playing a server that has 10-20% of players speaking a language other than English are also being petty.
---
yes it is
---
I thought Faerlina was for crossfitters?

Classic and Tool album in the same week though! Get hyped!

Thanks

Mostly people sitting in cities cybersexing in public at level 1.

Reporting in!

MC isn't done by anyone except those who want legendaries by the time you're in Naxx.  I remember it being hell to get attunements for alts after AQ was released because no one ran those dungeons anymore.  I had to ask guildies for help back in the day.
---
His play time is 4-8 hours per week, an MC clear takes hours to do, meaning he probably won't be raiding often at all, especially if you avg playtime is less than 1h per day.
---
I’d also like to know this, I hadn’t even heard of ‘APES’ until yesterday. 
---
Now I’m hearing that they can ruin an entire servers world PvP for the other faction. I also heard they usually play alliance but are now going horde?
---
What does it even mean? Leveling?
---
Whitemane and Fairbanks could be a sneaky good option.
---
Yea I'm not too concerned. I am not a hardcore player by any means, I just want to enjoy the game as I did all those years ago and meet new people to hang out with in game.
---
Are you by any chance on Fairbanks?
---
Who cares
---
tsugami
---
Same as a normal server, you'll just see a lot more people actively RP'ing in cities, etc.
---
Keep dunkan. The mage is a dick for showing off.
---
How so? I remember people freaking out when they'd see a super short name.
---
"Live to win!"
---
It is pretty much random, it's originally from PSN where everything was taken.
---
yeah thought about that. but i will loose half of the sub for it.
---
i thought maybe a nice person who already got their names and had a free slot could help out. a friend of mine snagged one of my names on pvp server so i have atleast that :)
---
I'm playing on Grobbulus, and I really wanted Kek. Kekk was available but nah. I got Ru, Yu, and Wilfred.
---
nope who ever got it will prolly sell it to him tho
---
Smart move.
---
I upvote for OSRS content.
---
glad I'm not rolling on that server, but it will be a lot of fun to watch
---
i didnt wanna be the one who said it
---
I think you're probably just more realistic. I also said 2 to 4 months. I played vanilla and have played on a private server about a year and a half ago. I am not looking for a power grind and have a job. 2 to 4 months sound like you're trying but still having fun.
---
I also prefer that last one.
---
Descartes is a terrible guy. Pascal is better.
---
I've been paying attention to the NA servers because that's where I am, but good luck to ya. Seems Herod is unofficially the sweaty try hard PvP server of NA.

Lol horde is going to wipe the floor with alliance. Most of the pro pvpers are horde
---
I'm not a fan of his stream personality, but I can see why it attracts people.
---
When he is a guest on a show, he's much more normal and provides excellent analysis and conversation.
---
Playing on whatever server he wants is being an asshole? Defending his right to play on whatever server he wants is being an asshole?
---
Please explain to me how either if these situations makes anyone an asshole

As a Guy who never played alliance and rarely does deadmines.. I think wailing cavern is supperior in every way..
---
Guild of no-lifer, some are great guys but some are pure cancer.

They won't "wreck the entire server", they'll just fuck the melee dps hard since they'll probably control the devilsaur leather market and make it very pricey

You guys sure love virtue signaling, that’s for sure.

Holy eff, google "shattered hand beyond remorse" and this thread comes up.  You playing Classic too?  (We'll be on Herod), a few original BR folks are hopping aboard.

You’re going to encounter assholes, regardless of nationality. Saying you draw the line at Brazilians is asinine.
---
it only has one charge

some people would say that's still the best way to play the game, some of my best memories from wow are just wandering around and finding things :)
---
I’m on Fairbanks.
---
It’s looking (right now) like it will be a 55%-45% horde favored split.
---
Thing I like about it is that it’s not the premier PvP server with a million people, and it’s not the streamer server either. It just seems like a happy medium.
---
Got it.
---
cmonBruh monkey???
---
Because Herod is an anagram of Horde.
---
My entire iTunes library, you mean?
---
Even in survival spec its unreliable as hell and when some dumbass breaks it there's no way to reapply it

So, someone in an expansion is excited about Classic.  Kind of the point.

Sure. Whatcha got?
---
Awesome to hear! I'll give it a shot. Danke schon!
---
I though launch was starting at patch 1.12, and the Gurubashi Arena chest didn’t go live until 1.4.
---
That’s all I’ve got, considered the same thing but since people keep posting about it the awareness will be too high to get anything valuable out of spending time there.

My goal is to just powerlevel past and come back later.

CS go? Brazil won 2 majors, only losing to Sweden in winning majors, alongside with a LOT of minor tournaments.  
---
Coldzera won best esports player on 2016 and was nominated in 2017.  
---
Since the ''official'' start for Brazil in CS GO Brazil gained ground and today its a very respected country in the game.
---
Killerxinok  won combobreaker a big tournament in MK X in 2018
---
We have a lot of winnings in Esports, our country its fucking huge, not that hard to know that this helps to find better players. I like fighting games and its not new to us japanese and european champions coming here to play alongside with out fighting tournaments and being ditched early.
---
We still have a lot of wins in minor games like just dance and guitar hero, but im not going to do the research, thats all that i remeber for now.

I think this is something blizzard will adress a little while before og during phase 6. What the players want. Because as you say. When everyone is in full naxx gear, what then? Maybe the answer is that its a little like diablo. You play a character and gear him. Then quit for a while. I don't think this will be a problem though until 2022-2023.
---
yes
---
That's priceless, I'd keep that shit. He's such a terrible streamer and a crybaby 😂
---
it'll last until somebody makes a better mmo which will happen not in the foreseeable future.
---
Failure detected: " In short, everyone is freaking out for no reason, wait for launch, if everything is fucked after launch then complain. 
---
Seriously? Let's just trust them, they'll surely get it right? Fairytale land material
---
Failure nr2: "Blizzard smartly released a conservative number of servers with more ready to go if need be. This is because it is way easier to add servers than to take them away and transfer people off dead realms. "
---
Merging servers is as automatic as it gets, the systems are in place. It's better to merge servers later if need be, than to kill people's experience with this phasing shit where you can't actually see everyone in your zone. This is NOT the vanilla experience.
---
And what then, phase 1 ends and you got 30k people on one server, how will that work WITHOUT phasing... so stupid
---
Some potions will be popular for leveling like Trolls blood, don't know if you can make decent money with it since professions will be a lot different with this population. Wait and see.
---
Gladly a gm will force you to change it.
---
Oh dude those names are good as! Onimusha is a nostalgia trip man, daaam!

FYI there's no right click reporting in classic
---
42 here rolled on Fairbanks
---
I think people are ignoring your point. There’s no catchup gear to the degree retail has. I stopped playing retail in ulduar with 363ilvl and came back for 8.2. I was 411ilvl after a few days of mostly solo content. Classic doesn’t have these mechanics.
---
Also Faerie Fire, a dope Sunder Armor alternative.
---
Actually, spaniards are hated too. They are the brazilians of Europe.
---
I was thinking about this recently. It would be interesting if after a while they released a BC server, where your could choose to upgrade and continue or not. If not then you stay on the classic server obviously.
---
Nailed it. I also 10/10 dislike high population servers.
---
Man you really can't follow a simple conversation. I said 15k because that was the peak at launch. The streamer said 14k because he started an hour or two after launch like I already stated. Vanilla radar says 13.5k in JULY. The server opened late June you fucking idiot.
---
Does their armor cover everything then? No more giant holes in my chainmail at literally my weakest point?
---
TO
---
Horde will have pvp guilds of equal skill, if you are serious about battlegrounds you will join such a guild anyway.  Premade vs premade is the best.  
---
Trust me you really don't want to play in random groups in battlegrounds in vanilla, no matter the side those apes are on.
---
But where's myfreepaysite
---
I think they would. From what I’ve heard they are super tryhard. Also, since Shazzrah seems to be the main server, playing there as alliance would probably mean their queue times would be quite short
---
Weihenstephaner is a good choice. Konig Ludwig is my go-to, though. I usually have to settle with Franziskaner because that's all they usually have in my area, which isn't really settling since it's great, too.
---
Why would they address the speculation it won't be removed? They already stated what their plans are and the latest they plan to have it around. If people didn't believe it then, what purpose would it serve them to reiterate it and have people not believe them now?
---
So I have heard! these guides are meant to help noobies narrow down their spec however, and they are unlikely to ever reach naxx level gear, so it felt silly to be giving survival a high mark when its rather crap for much of a hunters raiding career.
---
We'll be playing classic.
---
Pets were 100% fine for me.  But, no matter how many times I tried I could not do a good jump shot (run one way -&gt; jump -&gt; spin in air, Arcane Shot -&gt; turn back around to face original direction). I could do it no problems during Vanilla and on pservers, but, not in classic.  Not sure why.
---
I never had the chance to be part of a private server but that is good to know, thank you! But do you believe after a while of playing just classic it will grow boring especially if you have raided everything there is to raid, done everything there is to do, etc.?
---
Anti-BR isn't exclusive to r/classicwow. It's across pretty all of gaming.
---
Hi, /u/BandagedBacon

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpubzm/can_you_roll_on_chinese_servers_from_us/). 
---
Ive never understood it.
---
Most dungeons are remade bruh
---
&gt; then I thought maybe I’ll just take herbalism and mining and go the forager route. 
---
This is really a pain in the ass in classic.  You have to swap back and forth between the 2 and there's a several second delay before the other one loads.
---
Herbing/Alchemy + fishing is quite useful as a mage.  Lots +damage increasing pots in mid to late leveling, and you'll need plenty of HP pots early on.
---
It does cover every hole on your body😂
---
Hey man, I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate all the time you put into this reply. I will be rolling Alliance on Herod, so if you’re too, I hope to run into you! :)
---
Wanted Jalopy on Herod. 
---
Didn't get Jalopy on Herod. :(
---
Happy to help 🙂
---
Clearly u didn't want it that bad if u just stopped trying because it "wasn't working". It wasn't working for pretty much everyone. Persistence.
---
Layering, I doubt they will control every layer.
---
Wailing Caverns was part of The Barrens experience. In my memory, I kind of see that whole zone as a memorable time in my life. When I think of Westfall/Deadmines, Deadmines itself stick out more than all of Westfall. Not sure if that makes any sense? I played the game while in high school and probably had about equal amount of playtime in both areas.
---
I created a rogue on retail while waiting for character creation. While still in the starting zone a level 4 warrior on a motorcycle mount rode past me and with him went any small chance I had of playing retail while waiting for classic launch. Like WTF?
---
I don't know exactly how it's made, but a croissant without butter would be very strange. You don't want it.
---
Has anything about the experience so far given you reason to believe otherwise?
---
Alt + F1 too for nvidia users.
---
weren't most dungeons redone in cataclysm?
---
I mean, I hope so. But my other thought is when they say classic it will only ever be...classic. No expansions. I would love TBC/WoTLK again. I think after those 2...the game sorta got "eww"
---
Boomer on online meme boards just means an older millennial with responsibilities like kids, wife, house, etc.

Bullseye is the only one I can see being legitimate for an RP server. To me, it’s the only one that sounds like a legitimate nickname an character could have in the real world. Could be a dwarf named “(insert good dwarf name)” but he’s hung out with a lot of humans and was always a great shot, so instead everyone calls in Bullseye.
---

Here's a graph I found. 2018 was the first one where OSRS made more money than RS3. 
---
RS3 is far from dead, but it's not looking good. Mobile was an insane boost to OSRS, wonder how RS3 mobile would help.
---
Appreciate the shout out but I’m looking for blink on Whitemane.
---
But... the majority of the dungeons are pretty different than what they once were. Even RFC and DM have vastly different mobs and mob layouts.
---
We must crawl before we walk, then we dance.
---
No one knows
---
I've never had my name taken on any server I've played on.
---
Today my name was taken.
---
Nop, they specify in the blue post that the name becomes available right away. I'm waiting another day or so to actually make my characters with the names I saved.
---
Ooo I like that name a lot, I suck at names like a lot so my normal names are angryboi my fury warrior and just morbidgull for my Spreist just because it’s my OG Name and the other one to test the restrictions. I don’t even play warlocks let alone casters lol.
---
The short answer is 'nobody knows'.
---
Blizzard has said they don't have any set plans yet and are open to suggestions from the community.
---
The three options we've seen come up most are:
---
Most Likely: TBC released around 2nd year anniversary of Classic launch.
---
Likely: Nothing.  Game stays in it's final vanilla form as subs dwindle and people return to retail for 9.0.
---
Least Likely: Classic+, where new content is released, but the game version stays at 1.12.  For example, releasing TBC but with no level increase, no Blood Elves and no Draenai.
---
Are there any official updates on which communities will be going where? I heard the “Spanish Coalition” first said golemagg but then changed to Shazzrah. I know Scandinavians are going Shazzrah, and I believe the Polish and British too. Leaves me wondering, who’s going Golemagg?
---
I'd like to be like "see this is what the sub looks like when they **don't** delete shitposts and redundant content" ... but I also realize this is exactly what some people like, so whatevs.
---
Do whatever you please. Despite your best efforts to make it sound like it I don't intend to kick down your door and play the game for you.
---
This has been the least productive conversation I've ever had with someone on this site, possibly ever. Good day.
---
Right, so there will obviously be nodes in Durotar but just not in Valley of Trials
---
I love that it makes the armor cover the entire body. No more gaping holes at my weak point in my chainmail, but idk if it's worth world of breadcraft.
---
hurrr i play dps hurrr i press button to make boss die
---
Why? Can’t he use it too?
---
The horde is pepper because they are going to get CRUSHED! ...I'll see myself out
---
Seems like you have some literacy issues, I agreed with you on skill cap and said it was pointless to complete the games.
---
Are you having issues viewing usernames?
---
I played vanilla as a kid, so I really didn’t get a chance to enjoy the small things like this. I will be on the hunt for this since it seems dope! Thanks for sharing! I have this saved haha
---
Girthyshaft, cactuslicker and curseyamoms are my reserved names
---
the dutch group I was in went fro Golemagg.  I didn't join them because my old vanilla server (international crowd) chose Shazz and that felt better for me
---
Friggin liar theres no artist named soapbug, wanted to see if theres smth with normal people

I literally can't stop laughing at the thought of being punched by a bread monster.

Thanks man

To make a level 1 character? If BC comes out I can make a Blood Elf. They don’t say “Go to EPL and farm the rep to exalted first”. Anyone who would want to play a blood elf would just not buy the expansion.
---
Weirdly accurate
---
Then why gank people when they are at half health? Or why gank low level people? If it’s just testing how good you are. 
---
“I am so good at killing people with 20% health left after pulling mobs. I am the man.”
---
You forgot tali and evitel
---
Appreciated, ty
---
yeah it'll be interesting
---
Ya me too
---
Do what you want, have a look at something like classicdb.ch for alternatives.
---
This is bang on the money. I'm so tired of doing what Blizzard suggests rather than what I find fun.
---
Can't wait for classic. Just the feeling of exploring and feeling *vulnerable* again will be refreshing.
---
I wonder how many of these streamers will be playing two weeks after launch
---
I didnt forget, i just dont know who they are :p
---
Got my name. Giant black tauren warrior named Gumibear.
---
Krieger class for Classic WoW confirmed.
---
I got the name Onslaught and  Beastmode so I'm pretty happy for my main and alt.
---
Prepare your hunter for the constant "YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!" jokes.
---
There should be at least 8 PvP english speaking realms. Launch is going to be a complete shitshow, layering or not.
---
At this rate, they could also realize that Spanish/Portuguese language servers in the SA region are in demand (or "anti-demand", from the rest of the community), and just make an official server, and that might redistribute a bunch of people off of Herod.

Bags can be bought. You can’t buy that bloodvine set bonus, though.
---
yeah... i'm good with not being on streamer server... if queues are bad they will release more servers... no big deal
---
No need to financially big dick OP. A lot of people don’t want to waste money, regardless of their income.
---
Some people don’t see spending $7.50 for the opportunity to make a character worth it.
---
*dueling intensifies*
---
I believe the difference here is mainly cosmetic. It shouldnt take that long to unlock a race and is unsettling for returning players. If you spend weeks earning something, it should give you some sort of advantage or power increase in the end. This is the only way it feels worth earning.
---
terrible people. don't worry about them
---
I’m not too sure right not to be perfectly honest, just gonna see how it goes.
---
Same, at customs.
---
I think you're like me .. tired of the same bullshit with different wrapping. Since WoD with the garrison and world quests the game has felt the same , just becoming easier and easier with more ways to get loot and high ilvl with least work and communication to other people
---
The unlock requirements for allied races have been known for a long time.
---
Nost was a shitty vanilla approximation. Would have been embarrassed to be there. I was playing a shitty Wrath approximation.
---
No, People who tell you otherwise are Talking out of their ass.
---
If you did Cap 1 skill to 99 in osrs you could easily make 1 or 2 alts to 60 in the same time.
---
If we are Talking mundane grind, still no lol.
---
Osrs: chop down this tree 1000000 Times. Dont do anything else, just click and wait.
---
Classic wow: do quests if you like but you can mob grind if you like aswell or do dungeons.
---
Osrs are PURE grinding with no alternativ, classic wow you can do what ever you like
---
probably had more than one job
---
They at least should release a PSA on the number of players on each server.
---
They do, but they don't act like decimals in math.  4 is before 12
---
Classic let's you more freely decide when and how long you play.
---
On the other hand it's essential how you approach the game. If you play with the mindset to fall behind if you play less than others it may end up feeling like a chore again.
---
This may not apply to OP but I feel like it's essential to bring joy to the game as a community  instead of trying to consume happiness from the game.
---
This illustrate well the IQ and mentality of Shazz 😂
---
I wanted Ok. I got Ki instead. Kinda bummed but still happy.
---
It's actually called a reference to an episode of South Park. OP is not a geologist.
---
Funny how this Reddit and the forums were so extremely anti-streamer and toxic by "claiming" Herod as their own. All while the streamers were being respectful and thinking through solutions. Shows what a bunch of asocial retards this Reddit is 👌

Because it'll have the worst queues and the sperg anti-streamer community filling up chat talking about people who are supposedly not worth their time.

just get some cheese for that mac and you are good to go

How about multiple posts with screen shots of the countdown?
---
However silly those things are important ain’t they, it’s so rare these days in retail to find someone not busy enough to mess about with. Here’s to more of these times!
---
Reddit relationship experts.
---
&gt; then refuse to learn when being offered the info
---
why should they learn to fix their own PC? That's what you get paid to do. You actively trying to work yourself out of a job?

Priests and mages benefit from phase 1 tailoring much more than warlocks. Using an entire profession for like 6 more spellpower is essentially useless.
---
Tailoring for bloodvine is orders of magnitude more beneficial.
---
Mac's actual name is actually Ronald McDonald, not Mac McDonald.
---
It's like reposting things that are already on the front page of a subreddit, posting single Imgur links as album or link to the thumbnail of an image.
---
But instead of enforcing rules to prevent this type of behavior so that people learn and take the extra 10 seconds to do it right we just let it slide.
---
Quality wise reddit is really going downhill.
---
I'm not saying don't try to find people with similar experiences in and outlook on life. But I am saying that people "claiming" servers for themselves is ridiculous. You do not hold that kind of power.
---
And why does it even matter? How does the matter of your sexuality come up in WoW?

I can't wait to play with you guys :)
---
Horde can raid without the dwarf racials and horde can PvP without the racials, too. So none of them are a must have.
---
And if you play a race you don't like, you may not even hit level 60 in the first place.
---
When you don't want to extreme min/max, play whatever you like. As a priest you will have no problem joining a party.
---
I draw the line with BR, Latin servers, French, French canadians, and anyone else that I cant communicate with. It's simply a logical choice. Nothing more, nothing less
---
Any of the 27" will do, I wouldn't recommend the base 21" (non-Retina, integrated graphics).
---
You'll have to play around with the settings yourself to get the 4K/5K scaling right. Overheating isn't really an issue, just poor performance.
---
And yes, your keyboard and mouse will work. I'm not sure if every gaming peripheral company has ported their customization software over to MacOS, so you'll want to double check before buying one with lots of macro buttons and other features, but in general, you'll be fine.
---
That's definitely an unpopular opinion, in an unpopular opinion sub.
---
Aka a bunch of retards were trying to pretend they were as important as the streamers they hate so much
---
I was unable to set myself to offline when in game. My desktop launcher is set to appear offline but when I'd log in, it would switch me to busy. Additionally, if I had bnet friends on the other faction in classic, it will only tell you their name and server.
---
That's exactly why I stopped playing BFA. I ground through Legion because I liked the classes and Argus a lot. But literally nothing is appealing about current WoW. Bring on my nonexistent rotation with limitless tools to use in any situation and satisfying gear grind!
---
God I miss George Bush jokes
---
Screw that, i'm flying back.
---
I assume he will never get a different races mount hah
---
I thought it was rather obvious that when we talk about x country playing on a realm it does not mean 100% of the people. There is a Nordic Project on Shazzrah, while not on Golemagg. Of course that doesn't mean there will be literally 0 Scandinavians on Golemagg, it means a vocal Scandinavian community have decided on Shazzrah and with it follows a lot of lurkers.
---
If everything is equal there should be 50/50 Scandinavians on both, but with this Nordic Project it is not equal - it will make Shazzrah the server with most Scandinavians as far as we know (obviously no one knows the future, but it is the best guess we can do).
---
You just made me realize that the "Þ" character looks like a tongue sticking out emoticon 👅

Interesting, since you stick your tongue out to make that sound.

I just ate a Tide pod
---
&gt;Patch 1.4 was before 1.12...
---
You're right. But that numbering system seems crazy to me. Almost as if Blizz had no clue how [software version numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) is normally done. 
---
* 1.0
---
* 1.1
---
* 1.2.1
---
* 1.2.2
---
* 1.3
---
* 1.3.1

Yeah I was busy all day making sure my old man cat did not completely murder the new cat we adopted haha
---
Good ol' randomizer, dial me up some good ones!
---
Perhaps if you spent a bit more time being educated, you'd also know that the power of my pc has nothing to do with the server issues on blizzards end.
---
Also, my computer is better than yours kid. Maybe when you grow up you'll get nice toys too.
---
WELL HES GUNNA GET THAT ASS!

I think you would be best served by also posting the graphic settings from both.

If he doesnt make a Dennis character I will personally skin him alive and turn him into a lamp.. A lamp that I will display on my mantel.

Which is honestly still much better than Retail

Need more resolution and render scale. Throw in MSAA too.

No I'll will was meant.  And I guess in my ignorance all I know is the stereotype.

You can raid just fine up to a certain level with limited time though.

/r/iamverysmart
---
Cringe in its highest form, congrats.
---
I disagree. I think disappointment in Blizzard is completely misplaced. He is in no way entitled and everyone knows when a ton of people tries to log into the same thing it will cause problems. This is the same with any MMO launch, ticket sales sites for big concerts, new release of mainstream products etc. You can't expect Blizzard to spend money to handle that large amount of players for a few days at launch and even less to spend money keeping name reservation stable. And if it can't be expected, neither is disappointment placed rightfully at them.
---
Besides, it *was* an even playing field. It isn't like he was directly targeted by someone to not get in right away. No one hacked him. Everyone was capable of trying to log in at the exact time it went up. Some were lucky to hit the right moment, some were not. On top of that, it is completely random who would get DC. Literally the only thing different is peoples own equipment, but you can't blame Blizzard if your computer or connection sucks.
---
I mean, it is pretty much RNG when you tried to log in. If you don't like the idea of RNG I don't really think WoW is the game for you anyway. RNG is fair in its own way by not targeting anyone specifically.
---
I can't even bring myself to do unlock flying. I just hate the things I have to do to grind rep in retail.
---
Laugh about it I guess haha, and if you see him in the street... well you know what to do my guy.
---
I did. He deleted the comment.
---
You should calm down, it isn't that serious.  Even if he told no one up until release, you would see what server he is on as soon as the game came out, and pick a different one.
---
LF the following names:   **Maybe**, **asdf**, **Cassiusclay**, **Ego**,  --- Shazzrah EU
---
**if you have these PM me !**
---
Same only my wife joined during TBC. Rock on gamer dad.
---
...uhh so you're complaining about having to grind in an mmo to get what you want... you may not like classic.
---
Okay, now do that with 60 lvl.
---
As others have said, rogue would be closest but still not similar. Honestly, just base your picks on what seems interesting rather than what matches your retail classes.
---
Agree maybe layering is off or way less worse than decribed.
---
Happened to me
---
I'm rolling on Shazz but that comment made me laugh.
---
But it’s additional content... and timers exist for classic too, the endgame is about speed running anyways...
---
Logging on for a few minutes a day to do dailies is not grinding. That’s casual.
---
There is a difference between accepting a druid and accepting a paladin. Kind like picking the guy with one arm for dodgeball and picking the guy with one arm, a fake leg, and a severe asthma for your team
---
Dennis is a bastard man
---
Zippers down for Harambe.
---
Yep, the only PvP servers for EN in EU region.
---
I'm hoping I don't get to that point, as I'm planning on being an avid wpvper. Plus, I'm not going to be hitting 60 any time soon - I've got a full time job and school to worry about first.
---
José Mourinho?
---
Who took my luckystrike on thalnos
---
Sooo,  he's like 95% of people?
---
Hope this on a roleplay server.
---
Most people these days would just ignore them and continue using Discord.
---
4 warriors and a shaman
---
3 mages a lock and a priest
---
Just misspell something in your name if you really want to keep it. Captain Stubs is usually taken in my experience, but Captain Stubbs is rarely, if ever, taken!
---
So then there’s no real reason to prefer Herod over Thalnos. Toxicity across the board.
---
i think its free on https://southpark.cc.com/
---
This is better than most responses to r/writingprompts .
---
I’m trying to keep it light. Must-haves for me are Pitbull, Domino, Clique and Tomtom. I’m not using any questing addons because I like having to read quest text and figure it out for myself—but when I get stuck and have to look something up on wowhead, it’s nice to use coordinates.
---
I’ve played on RP servers for over 10 years now. There are normally locations where RPers will congregate for RP. But a lot of folks will not be in character 24/7. 
---
If you are worried about RPing just play the “strong silent” type man of few words or Pick a character from fiction you like and act like that character. You would be surprised how much fun it can be. You’re basically playing pretend like you did as a kid. I’ve played a paladin based off of William from A Knights Tale for forever. He has evolved over the years but that’s what I based the inspiration for him on.
---
Ever heard the story of the boy who cried wolf?  If every thing is a MASSIVE problem to you, then suddenly all your massive problems seem like no big deal.  Then when there is something you actually SHOULD complain about no one will listen.
---
I'm "Jr" on Herod, which is just short for Junior.
---
Also i think people seriously underestimate how fucking hard naxx is in classic. Many many good guilds gave up at BWL.
---
&gt; Most people will just idle in a city all day.
---
Idling in a city spamming 'need tank+healer for Strat/Scholo/UBRS!'...
---
Is that Simon farnaby?
---
No, it's a free tenner.
---
You will lose those names in a week on RP server
---
Y'all have some normie ass names
---
No, no boosts. Your friend is about to lose ten whole pounds.
---
So apparently it’s too casual to complete for this guy? Haha
---
Repost of removed.
---
Wrong. There are many types of toxicity.
---
Well those posts get up voted way up to the front page, so obviously some people care.
---
No.  No speed boost or anything, thankfully.
---
And there's no way anybody is hitting 60 in 24 hours.
---
But puff and yellow are not allowed.
---
GG Blizzard.
---
Don’t have to if you play Guild wars/Guild wars 2! 😉😉
---
We do something similar. Feral Tank, Priest Heal, warlock/hunter/warri dps. Good Aoe tank and no worries because of loot. Everbody happy 🙂
---
This is it, however redditors dont have friends outside computer so obviously they wouldnt know :D
---
Honestly thought you were trolling but then I though about it and I definitely see what you're talking about with the numbering..
---
Looking for Hope on Herod.
---
&gt;What about that post yesterday or so about the person being sharded away from their group mid fight?  
---
&gt;Reply
---
I haven't seen anything so I can't comment about that.  But this is a beta, so its likely that kind of behavior is not intended.  According to blizz thats not how they want it to work.
---
Firstly: Yes, thank you. I appreciate that they organized and made a big bustling community while letting others be safe havens. 
---
But secondly, most of the rage was directed at Asmongold. Because, while most streamers were pretty cordial and respectful, Asmongold kept rattling off that “he didn’t need to do shit for anybody.” And he’s right, he doesn’t... but it would absolutely tarnish his reputation. I’m glad it seems he’s settled for Faerlina, but the whole 3-4 day period where he’s triumphantly stirring people up was asinine. 
---
Especially because he thinks people want to know where he plays, so that they can either be his fan club or snipe him. I even like Asmongold, but that whole ordeal made him look too egotistical to realize that most want to *avoid* him and his miasma of followers ingame.
---
Work, work!
---
First time I did RFC i was like... thats it?
---
LOK'TAR OGAR
---
*cries in central time*
---
So your post have zero valuable info... ok ...
---
The key here is that before Wrath, you had alternate paths to collecting the reps necessary for rewards. Don't wanna do dailys? Okay go grind some mobs. Don't wanna grind mobs? Okay throw on a tabard and go do some dungeons. Blizzard makes all these awesome systems then throws them in the garbage in the next expansion.
---
Think I probably won't accept it, but I look forward to being proven right.
---
Do you really consider the streamer server the most LGBT friendly? Do you know phobic the majority twitch/streamer community is? 
---
Also who is "We"? Did I miss a referendum or something?
---
Like I said, I love speed running. I just dont want the timer to be there.
---
My boyfriend did the same thing, I was trapped logging in so he saved my first choice name for me.
---
As someone who's goal is to do the 60 dungeons over and over again I'd like to disagree. Retail dungeons just don't feel like I'm adventuring with a party into a dangerous dungeon anymore.
---
Jesus chil bro
---
I haven't unlocked flying for the last 3-4 expansions as I refuse to grind dailies for it (and I've usually unsubbed again by the time they even unlock the option to grind for it...)
---
The upside is you don't have to have the name bossbaby anymore.
---
approximation it was like 95% accurate
---
Black Lotus
---
Again, that's your opinion.  Some people would disagree with you.  Also retail does not have layering it has sharding.  They are different whether you will accept that fact or not.
---
I’ve played quite a lot of Vanilla WoW, and pretty much every expansion extensively aside from
---
BC and BFA.
---
Time-gating is not grinding. It is annoying.
---
And back to the main point, the issue is it’s the first time coming back to the game and not being able to play what is designed to get players to return. They are designing solely to retain players, which punished anyone for quitting. It is a shit system
---
So this guy is complaining about playing 30 minutes a day for a skin in a game he wants?
---
Someone should play a frost mage named VanillaIce
---
See Edit2 in the following [post](https://nm.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpkjy8/low_mod_week_is_sortakinda_in_effect/ewq1mso/)
---
Well, guess i remember wrong then.. because i for sure remember getting black war stuff on my tauren warrior by the highest rank i got was stone guard.
---
Onslaught? Yea just go to their site/discord
---
Look at this prick launch up in his chair when he realized he’s talking to a new player lol
---
&gt; Really surprised Dragon's call is not in the list, hands down the best pre-bis 1h sword by far.
---
you'd be surprised at the dps of a DW dragon call spec.
---
In a way I'm kinda betting on the "low" pop servers. I'm legit concerned that if we have good player retention, high pop is going to struggle to drop layering in a meaningful way. Low population is more likely to become a dead server, but also less likely to be a Nost high pop clusterfuck if people actually stick around. And if the game grows organically over time (which I am also betting on) new players will likely be funneled to the lower pop servers.
---
If anyone has Ghoul, Gorguts or Maegor TELL ME 🙂
---
I got Floirdaman on mankrik . You never know what’s about to happen with a Druid or a Florida Man.
---
I mean, every single point OP makes is a generalization. I gave specific points on what I dont like about playing with people from those servers. The nationality point is more of a given...
---
I have no issues with the people outside of the impact on my gaming experience. It is the same reason people in FPS games hate running into Chinese players most likely. The gaming culture itself seems different. In FPS games, the Chinese culture it to win by any means necessary, including cheating. Do all Chinese cheat? Nope, and everyone knows that. But it is so common in the culture and you generally have no way to communicate with them. You end up stuck either with/against cheater or you are unable to communicate with your team. How is that enjoyable? How is it racist to look out for your own enjoyment?
---
Br/latin servers are notorious in wow for 2 things: non-english/very bad english and bad players in pug/dungeon finder groups.
---
Are they all a problem? Nope, ran into a few myself over the years that dont meet those issues, but it is infrequent
---
But is this verified? Do you have any vague links to something unrelated that back this all up?
---
They were compressed to save space, using a format that didn't lose any quality (remember how bad gif and jpg files generally used to look?  And how enormous uncompressed bmp files were?)
---
Back then it wasn't really assumed that you could do much without "a program' for it
---
I don't even play anymore but TI is always hype as fuck.
---
They played themselves by sperging on reddit all weekend

I want to ask English speakers for support, do you want Warsong 2.0 to have you? Many Russian veterans want to play on their Russian servers with the support of an English client. Blizzard completely ignores this opportunity, the proof is the removal of the topic: by reference:   [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/ru/wow/t/topic/7648](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/ru/wow/t/topic/7648)  The author of this topic did not even get a notice about this!   We need your support, we need English client support on Russian servers !
---
Cries what a great story.
---
Also me cries harder have no friends
---
I dont RP, but I have always played on Argent Dawn EU. I really like the people on RP servers, they tend to be more respectful and mature(the irony with those names ;D). So looking forward to a nice respectful PvP environment.
---
Not anymore
---
Herod boys up in here.
---
Yeah, they aren't as different of servers as you're worried they are.
---
And also the rotations. Why do people want to have given rotations instead of just using the spells which are usefull in the given situation. It feels like playing a minigame while playing for no reason other than make things needlessly complicated.
---
One of my favorite vanilla wow memories is when I was in a group who stumbled their way through all of brd. Having d&amp;d to compare it to now it was absolutely a big fun dungeon crawl.
---
This way looks good, I think there's something down there. Nope dead end. Turn around, find a boss, but no we need to get something from somewhere else first. It was amazing. And struggling to make the lyceum work. I love that place.
---
Fucking bird
---
Lol I tried to get Leeroy for my warrior but wasn’t to be with dc’ and server issues logging in
---
I'm with you I just canceled my sub because it is going to ruin the game.
---
Thanks man, really appreciate it!
---
How is the PvP in classic WoW. Is there Arena and Battlegrounds or only world PvP?
---
Retail, raiding, mythic+, mount farming, gold farming and just hanging out with the guildies. 
---
Oh and I got stuck working overnight the 30th, so probably being up for a couple days straight that weekend.
---
I think a lot of it is he doesn't stream a video of himself which means he doesn't rely on over the top antics to get views. He just makes cool videos about the game instead of videos about himself playing the game.

You horde guys are alright!

Ninja as in the fortnite guy?

Theres not enough hours in a day to make it to 60 day 1. Impossible !

Looking for Danathar on Shazzrah, dont have anything to trade with really. But love to see if there's a possibility.
---
I don't at all agree. There's a special something those forums had that discord can't replicate.
---
You meant to say Whitemane ;)
---
Best part is, this didn't include people like me that didn't want to pay just to reserve a name.
---
I'll just be over there picking flowers.
---
420. Roll up or roll out
---
But runescape is mindless grinding
---
If he pulls it off, it would be about 5x faster than the world record.
---
&gt;More of my friends are coming back day one that aren't on blizzards radar but played vanilla here and plan to do it again.
---
It's like 5 people but that is the case of my entire friend group as well. Pretty sure it's gonna be insane, lol.
---
It's the game for you, not necessarily for everyone else.

Looks like the potential for shenanigans. It is a shame the server will die when all the streamers move on to the next new thing
---
Gimme the karma baby!
---
There's a good amount of quests for WC, but the lore/preceeding quests isn't as big as Deadmines. It isn't part of a big overarching storyline. I think the inside of the dungeon is more interesting than Deadmines though.

It isn't a still picture.

 I want English on the Russian server to be secondary and thats all !

Yes but dont go alchemy just buy them from me
---
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime!

There's honestly nothing to disagree with. A few people like yourself would use them but the vast majority would not.

As far as I could tell, yes. I havent played retail since Legion, though.

11pm bst

I'm gonna state this here but it's not the streamers we dont want to play with it's the groupies that form a horde around them. 
---
Think of eating a peice of pie with 3000 sitting on your lap. Lol
---
Guess that's what i remember.
---
I got Ironbeard on 3 different servers so I'm happy
---
I'm okay with a timer being a part of a dungeon. Like some boss lights the area you're in on fire and you need to rush through enemies to the next boss before you're engulfed in the flames. However, I find the M+ timers to just be obnoxious.
---
You see, I was telling myself I'm gonna hold off until a day or two before launch to create a character, but you're gonna make me do something I don't wanna do, aren't you? :)
---
There's time gated crafting in classic too lol .
---
I'm not a fan of the unlock system foe allied races either but it's really nothing to vent over. Yes it is an incentive for players to come back, but the reasoning for forcing you to unlock them is to dabble your feet in the new max level content they created. It's not punishment it's just grindy game design.
---
&gt; You wanna play the race do the grind...
---
Which is why myself and my guild quit retail. What an absolute joke of a system.
---
Well, i know i got them when max lvl was 60
---
Realistically you should up it to 100 or even 1000 and make it 48 hours. Even the most efficient aoe/cleave groups will take over 3 day played and solo you will be over 4 days played. Most people will be between 6-10 played who are really trying and many longer then that.
---
You always need more dakka.

This is awesome! Job done.
---
Ah but you see, its a she! That is no king!
---
This is stupid and I love it
---
It's too boring and casual, yes.
---
Totally agree with you. The apologists will say well you got a 5 hour queue instead of a 10 hour queue.
---
Looking for Yago on Herod
---
Suppose you are right. It will take you around 200 hours to get to 60 if you focus on getting to 60 as fast as you can.
---
If you take your time and have fun during the level-up process, it will take a lot more.
---
For people without too much spare time to play, this means several months. Just for leveling.
---
I can't believe people are defending this.
---
Sure, it's a minor thing, but it's not exactly a hard fix, and yeah, most people probably won't notice, but if it's there, it's there, and leaving it in is a mark of laziness from Blizzard, and there's probably countless more small issues that supposedly don't matter, those things add up. People need to drop this god-awful "Just be happy with what you're given" attitude, and start demanding a level of quality that they know can be delivered, not the bare minimum effort that Blizzard can throw out.

You should check out the Moon Guard US Server.

The Goldshire RP is a good place to start.

You could also do a roleplaying divorce inside the game. Then die from kobolds in elwynn forest. After that, make a new character on a PvP realm instead. U will still have the RP experience doing this.

I did this yesterday. I even went to different servers to see if my name is available there

It's a cool idea but it would never make it into the game. Ignore the autists raging at you.
---
As a personal rule I don’t whisper people or manually invite those with weird names I can’t type.
---
Kurtmangle is great too haha.
---
Those pops have no correlation to retail pops. I’m on a dead ass server in retail that says medium and the streamer server with about half a million viewers worth of streamers says medium.

Every server will be populated, some like herod will just be overpopulated to the point of idiocy.

It's becoming a pretty common anecdotal story. I mean, it makes sense.
---
People forget classic WoW really catapulted Blizzard because it was a good game that appealed to the masses, hardcore and casual alike because of its accessibility.
---
I'm speechless when people act like this game won't bring in new gamers when we talk North American scale. There's 3 PvP east servers, you're telling me there's not 15-20k new players in the entirety of central /eastern North America and then South America? I use those numbers because I genuinely believe new demand alone could fill every server, ignoring the already current player base on the radar.
---
I think blizzards going to be scrambling to open servers on launch and there will be a mass exodus through server transfers before P2. It's sad really, layering isn't even going to do what it was meant to prevent.
---
At this point there's no argument to not face 5+ Herods with shared naming conventions , all with one cohesive world each, that eventually get merged together. The asinine thought that Herod that is already high pop with zero new players playing is going to perfectly lose enough population to not be pure chaos without layering is hilarious.
---
I just can't really understand why you wouldn't want a herod 1-5 with shared naming convention and then a merger over time. Server transfers and new servers need to exist with this few servers for layering to be gone.
---
you're nothing but a Whiskey Delta
---
I won't lie. Those 10 minutes logging in and out waiting for the servers to update was the most fun I've had all week...
---
Is there one of these for Fairbanks?
---
Did you pass the game? /s
---
Some never see a mythic raid boss in retail especially end bosses
---
&gt;I've seen a lot of cringe names posted here
---
Like your name on here?
---
I kinda explained that in the post. It's probably a combination of the greater level of competition and easier content. I'm sure Joana's old 1-60 record will get smashed too.

I'm not sure that people will get in under 7 days, but lowering the private server record by a day or two is probably possible.

That's some impressive progress for 9 years! Thanks a lot.
---
Got my name on my main server but not on herrod :(
---
I dont know about that. This is your second post on the matter and when I played your last clip in full speed I couldn't tell a difference at all.
---
I can understand that for other parts of the game. Flying is a great example. I actually think the flying unlock system is fair, and coming back to the game if I were interested in playing it would give me a goal. 
---
But if my intention is to play Zandalari (And keep in mind I am a good chunk into it aside from needing to pay for a transfer which sucks), then I need to go back on a character I did not come back to play, be time gated on content I have already done for months daily, then finally I can make my level 1 and start playing the class/race I came back wanting to do. 
---
I’d rather do the content on the character I want. I’m happy to unlock flying on my new Zandalari Druid since I came back to play a Zandalari druid
---
I guess it’s hard to say where the fine line is of what’s okay to time gate. I just don’t think races is one of them. As Ion said, your class is the lenses through which you see the game. Well so is the race, and I didn’t come back to play a different Race/Class to get the lense I wanted :/
---
The cards I sell where I work are the only way I can still pay $15 CAD for a sub instead of having to pay like $19 cuz of the USD -&gt; CAD Conversion rates lol. Big comfy

I actually thought about picking hunter the most, would like to level in BM. Never played hunter much, tried during MoP or Cata, dropped after 42 lvl or so. Even made up a little legend behind the character.

---
you know vanilla is all about the grind right?
---
Exactly. Logged in today for the first time since the launch of BfA basically. I had like 10 stickied quests and a bunch of symbols and popups all over the place that didn't mean anything to me. Two new islands on the map that I have no idea how to get to.
---
I just logged out again, I wouldn't even know where to begin.
---
Right now we're waiting on confirmations for APES and Method. We probably will not know for sure until release.

It releases at 6pm eastern, that would be 3pm pacific

---
Ur the second one in 5 minutes to ask this question. No Eu streamer is big enough and with the same influence to worry about them
---
Omg lol
---
I agree 100%... they need to release a new EST PVP server BEFORE launch.  Launching a new server when people have already committed to a server and have dinged 20 or 30 works against the players who would have liked to roll on a est server other than herod and works against blizz bc fewer people will take them up on their new offering.
---
&gt; You and your guild quit because you had to grind in order to reroll? 
---
Yup. Absolutely not fun at all to have to grind that much to unlock a race. Saw the direction they wanted to go and bounced to FFXIV.
---
Just play whatever race you want to play, you don't HAVE to be a dwarf to make a priest
---
I found an addon the other day. I think called Classic LFG. It's basically a stripped down version of retail's LFG tool without the automation. Not sure if it will catch on but did download it because if it can widen the amount of groups I can find/ make, might as well.
---
STABILE DEUTSCH SANDALEN!
---
Ew Sports games! Gross! haha
---
Undead shadow priest would be my choice

I actually am thinking that it comes from EU.  00:00 in Blizz Paris ofice (is there still one?).

Same will be for actual launch.

Tell me about it. So much to do, so little time!

That’s the thing- they saw the raid.

Time conversion went the wrong way. It is 6pm Eastern which is 3pm Pacific.

---
Whats your name? Just curious
---
I was late to the party so none of these are the names I actually wanted.
---
I mostly just cant nail down a class out of those 3.
---
A trivial grind that 10x longer and 10x the effot to unlock a raid is ok but for a allied race is not ok lol
---
I've heard nothing of this, but if thalnos is the BR server then Canadians have no reason to go there, they speak English like the bulk of the NA community (unless you've been talking to Brazilian-canadians)
---
But of course, anyone can go anywhere, we're both talking anecdotally anyway
---
Even if you're different levels you still end up playing together. The person who's highest usually ends up helping the derps through dungeons. You run them through a few times so they gear better gear and then level faster. The higher level player also ends up running back and helping the lower level one when they're getting ganked. The actual questing part is mostly with just whoever is around you anyways. 
---
Yes the highest level person ends up doing their dungeons without the rest of the group, but they're playing way more than the rest of the group anyways.
---
I can hear the music, too... damnit, qwertytarr!

Now everyone starts freaking out about login queues on Herod, in 3 days they'll be suggesting a migration to Grobbulus, to ease the login times, they'll deal with the time difference and the RP aspects. 3 days after that Grobbulus natives will start an uprising, trying to fight off the impending invasion of Herodites. After that who knows.
---
thanks for sharing, gay

Bit different because people rarely audibly say reddit usernames and if they did, I'm sure they would just say "kiz".

Deathknight is actually a good exemple, because it's true that it was gated behind a level requirement, which needed to be attained, but, that's all it was also, just levels, meaning also anyone who played 'recently' (even 1 year before) were able to instantly get it. And others, could just continue what they were doing, until they had the level to get them. You could achieve this as fast as you were able to invest time, which gives us a ratio 1:1.
---
Whereas allied races, you need to farm, without achieving progress on any character, having some time-gated content, with potential daily-locked progress etc... It's about presences, you cant just spend your 2 day vacation grinding to get that new char, no you'll have to wait weeks of progress chipping at it. 
---
I mean, you're right that it's grindy and an MMO and all, that's totally valid, but it doesn't appeal to me(and others) though, i'd prefer the former, where my investment feels rewarded accordingly.
---
I would also prefer starting from level 1 for everything, and even having a long intro with the char or what-not because at least I can play the char I wanted to play immediately.
---
I've played Vanilla, and am coming back to classic because even if everything takes time, I have a lot of control over them compared to retail which feels like a mobile game with daily rewards.
---
I'm not shy of investment though, the rep grind might only take 20-30 hours, but I won't have the motivation to grind it (scattered daily) and THEN start the char, but I've had no problem spending 60 hours fishing, farming my nether ray in BC from neutral to Exalted straight because I could just repeat the quests. I had control. 
---
tldr: retail has 'speed-limits' which is a big downer for many
---
Im only interested in who got “Classic”.

You can just google "class + classic guide" and you'll be flooded with a million guides on how to play the game. If you can, though, I'd recommend avoiding guides. Just play the way you want to, and learn as you go. You'll end up being a more well-rounded player that way, imo. 
---
Following rigid leveling/talent guides might help you go slightly faster, but you won't learn anything about your class if you don't have to think for yourself about which talents look better, which spells you should be using, etc.
---
I dont see how that is relevant to you not using a search function for a question that has been asked a lot of times previously (and answered).
---
The Latin guilds went Herod... The only community to have commited to Thalnos was one Brazilian face book group of 3k people. Not going to be a big deal. Most BRs are bilingual aswell.
---
What?
---
People will just say about anything to criticize pservers.
---
I'd recommend remembering the subreddit definitely isn't a solid representation of the total number of people that will be returning for classic. It's still 2 weeks out lots of people won't be subscribing until day before launch too.

That still doesn't account for the fact that all of the EU realms are still at the exact same population tags as they were when I posted this 5 hours ago, as they were at 9AM, and also at 3AM. 
---
It being characters created does account for that.
---
Obviously normally, yes, it's not just characters created on the server (or rather accounts that have made one or more chars on the server), but as I quoted, it seems more like it was changed for the name reservation period so people could see the actual realm pop of how realms will end up.
---
As for the end numbers tied to each - we can only speculate, but we know that each layer can hold as many as a single vanilla server, so it makes sense that an actual realm can support several layers worth of players. Given that there was a 20k queue on Shazzrah at one point, I'm guessing High pop is somewhere in the 20-30k region. Considering that it's not listed as Full, that would suggest there's still more capacity there. If we compare on live a High pop server to Full, there is a significant difference in terms of number of guilds, server economy etc.
---
Compare Draenor/Kazzak to Outland, which are Full vs High, there are on the order of 3-10x as many commonly available items on the AH as there is on Outland. I know this is a pretty scuffed way of comparing realm health, but I do believe Blizzard knows what they're doing.
---
I don't think it's time to worry yet - there's literally one High realm. It's not even full. If launch rolls around and there's such an influx that every realm ends up as Full or High, then sure, I'd expect some more servers to open up, but it seems like they want a server with a relatively high population early on, as I guess they are expecting that it will drop significantly over phase 1.
---
So you didn't play bfa at all then since you know bugger all about its story.
---
Heres a tip when you first start bfa you atent even friends with the alluded factions.
---
Me and my few friends rolled here as well don't really want to play with the BR population and ques in the 10k to make names on herod are really not an option for anyone who value's their time.
---
I have the name Guildleader on Herod if you want it, offering a trade for any legitimately impressive Beanie Baby collection or a limited edition Stretch Armstrong doll
---
I think he’s just gonna play both. There isn’t that much content on either if you play the game for a living.
---
God, that’s my biggest grievance. It’s the *same damn mechanic* but one’s yellow, another is red, and that one is light blue.
---
Accounts without an authenticator get flagged all the time, especially if you're logging in from a machine or IP they haven't seen in a while.
---
Going to be lots of tourists who don't actually enjoy classic wow gameplay and just want to say they got 60 and drop the game.

Hey man, that invite expired, any way I could get another?  I'm rolling on grobbulus and I think they guild that just recruited me are a little too hardcore about time haha

Probably because there are a ton of people waiting for release before subbing instead of 2 weeks prior like the small minority that is reddit. And also probably because these "2004 memes" were made by kids that are in their early 20s mid 30s and just don't care anymore?

They will, when p2 releases.

&gt; rest of the game is essentially raiding, even if you plan to PvP.

For many of us PvP (and world PvP) is actually main goal and raiding is only needed because we need gear to pvp better.

Unless he uses some weird unitframes addon, he's not actually in party.

Its possible he uses an addon that lets you see friends etc on map (by reporting their coordinates to you). But he doesnt actually have any party frames up.

I’d bet 40% of the population is people there to play with streamers. Virtually everybody is streaming there. The other 60% will be regular folks who just want to play the game. 40/60 seems like one side would be the prominent voice of the community, but that 40% is going to be *loud, obnoxious, and spammy*.
---
It was the render scale after all that fixed it! Thank you. Enjoy classic

Herod may be listed as the only "High" pop server right now, but it's not like it used to be, where a queue was literally waiting for people to log off because the server can't handle over ~3000 people at once.  I waited in queue last night and started at 14500 in line and it took 6 minutes to get through the queue.
---
Nowadays it's the login/authentication queue, not the server capacity.  They can have tens of thousands of players on a single server now, no problem, its just a matter of getting them all logged in without murdering the login servers.
---
I'm not at all worried about the population on Herod, looking forward to a vibrant and active server for a change from the dead zones of retail.
---
Jason Mewes?

I was desperately trying to remember the last one, but couldnt, so decided to be sneaky.

Nope. Was caught. Well played, sir.

I play retail and classic on an 11" 2014 macbook air and a 27" 2015 iMac...the Macbook gets hot, so i don't play on it very long, but the iMac is fine.
---
This happens in WoW though too. If there’s an Icritmyself in your guild he’ll probably be called Crit or ICM or something by his guild mates.
---
Any TOOL fans? I got Maynard on Shazzrah
---
you do realize all of this happened AFTER Blizzard removed PvP realms and made RP-PvP obsolete, right?
---
Also AD has a much lower active population, half of those are just Goldshire tourists (just like on Moonguard NA). You have to look at max-level population to get a real sense of how active a realm is.

As a Scandinavian I'm starting to become quite sceptical about all the praise we get on this forum. Is it just Scandinavians circlejerking and praising themselves? If so, please tell me so I can join.

Hey I went and checked and it was the "master" branch. Thanks for the help!

Only pros i can think of is that you could play with the opposite faction, assuming pvp server.

Is Pepsi ok?

Yes i did

None. I've never understood wanting to watch someone else play instead of playing

I mean once Druid gets hybrid gear it has the ability to defeat any class at 60 with the exception of warlock. Just takes work.

No but I do have people stop me and ask what my dogs name is.

I hope you have a good day.
---
These were all almost completely optional, and added as an alternative way to make gold apart from professions. The dailies/WQ today are MUCH MORE "required" to progress.
---
Wasn't asking for it.
---
layering (formerly known as sharding)
---
&gt; the grind is gonna be worse
---
Difference is that in classic what you do stays with you. On retail once every 2-3 months new patch comes out and anything you did is null because people who started playing can catch up super fast and will be on even level again.
---
Rogue shits on Warriors, LOL.
---
Having characters on other realms means you cant share gold, items, friends, guild, etc. So i would say unless you specifically want to play on multiple realms, keep everyone on same one.
---
You have the private server 1.12 client set to 1024x768 and the Classic client set to 1092x564. You're comparing a 4:3 resolution to a roughly 2:1 resolution. If you're displaying this on a 16:9 or wider monitor and you have the 1.12 client window maximized then it's stretching the image horizontally. If you have the Classic client set the same way, windowed and maximized on a 16:9 monitor then it's stretching the image vertically.
---
Hello my fellow English-speakers.
---
I’m glad that WoW veterans who don’t play retail any more now are able to participate in discussions.  
---
And my first topic is about a thing, that bothers me much more than sharding, subscription and other stuff.
---
Let me ask: do you remember Warsong EU (and Shadowmoon and some other servers) ?
---
For those who don’t know, the European English Warsong realm eventually became de facto Russian one. Before the European WoW launch, we chose Warsong to be a main Russian realm (back then there were no Russian realms/client).  
---
Here, on these forums I’ve already seen topics entitled like “Russians stay away from EU servers” or something like that (and some posts were kinda offensive, btw).
---
The history may repeat itself. I bet you don’t want second Warsong. And I’m asking for your support - for our common interest.
---
What is this all about? Very simple. Here I’m asking Blizzard to **allow use of English client (both text and audio).** Currently, we cannot play using English text on Russian realms. Why we want this? Why this is **VERY** important? Because of nostalgia and desire to experience authentic vanilla - there was NO Russian version of original WoW, so back in 2005-2006 we had nothing to do but play in English. And we know and love the game in English. We got used to it, and now, for many of us, the REAL vanilla WoW is English WoW.
---
I know that many of players (at least my WoW Classic YouTube channel audience) are tormented by the dilemma: play on Russian and get non-authentic experience or play English servers just because of silly client language restriction? And some (many?) of them will choose to play on English European servers. So…
---
TLDR: Please allow to use English client on Russian realms. Thank you.

The con is it takes over 150 hours to hit 60.
---
You'll do that 3 times and have 0 gold on each character to start and you'll never be able to benefit off of each of their professions.
---
This is a result of the Layering cooldown to prevent abuse. Unless he stops entering combat and looting mobs, he'll never swap layers.
---
I played on a low pop server in vanilla and I actually preferred it over a high pop because you knew all the good guilds on the server and not everyone had bis gear so when you did see someone with good gear it was more impressive.
---
Really? Dare I inquire?
---
I was able to get Buttsex on my server, but I ditched it. Those names are only fun if you can show them off in Trade chat, and you know there will be people rightclick reporting you. I don’t wanna deal with a forced name change.

I decided to get into the Witcher 3 in the 3 months since release date announcement. It's pretty great, and long, which was quite helpful. Now I just need to finish it up in 2 weeks otherwise I won't touch it once classic releases XD
---
&gt; That server is the reason Classic exists.
---
That server was a massive waste of time and money that put many individuals in legal trouble. The developers who worked for 5 years to build WoW in the first place, they're the reason Classic exists and they deserve higher recognition than a couple internet pirates.
---
I got sent to Pyrewood. Noticed. Logged to Shazzrah and my character was there too? Went to server selection screen and it showed I had characters on both. Really odd.
---
Wendys brought back spicy nuggets i can do without this
---
Good luck, that server is the containment server. It's going to be horrible.

Wtf? Dr Disrespect?!

50+ is brutal.  At least now there are tons of resources.  When I did it in vanilla I didn't know where to go and there's no way I was going to grind mobs all day.  I just wandered around completely lost, wish I could see what my play time was to hit 60.

I played Thursday night, that was all I had. Got my wife back into the game, and we're both on 6 month subs now. It was fun, relaxed, and you feel like you earned things so much more. Not just slapping on some heirlooms, and owning everything. Having to remember to get water, food, bandages... it was a blast!
---
Okay fair point.  I didn't think about this being against the ToS.  I still think they could give preferential treatment to top donors, but who knows.
---
Yeah so I tried to copy my keybinds over to the 3 toons I made yesterday but they don’t have their WTF folders yet. So does that mean on launch day I gotta log in, Alt F4, copy the wtf folders over, then prey I’m not stuck in a queue when I report?
---
Generally, the forum trolls (nowadays; reddit/discord/etc) rarely have a meaningful impact on the life of the realm.

Things might be different this time around though...

Ouch, I’m sorry.

I used to hate and even lie when asked when I was from back in the day. Nothing worse than saying "Denmark" and then they reply "Same!" and now you have to type in danish.

Boomers are 55+ years old on the low end of the generation spectrum I doubt there are many of them playing WoW. Most likely Millenials since they were born 1981-1996 and maybe some Gen X. Think people don't know generation brackets and just consider anyone over 30 a boomer and anyone younger a zoomer.

I thought his name was Valkorn? Either way this is great haha

Thank you! They’ll go nicely with my human paladin named Crusader Aura on retail.

Matture

You’re literally just too stupid to even understand the argument . Cheers.
---
They'll get plenty of recognition in the form of paycheques.
---
But they would never have created Classic if Nostalrius didn't show that the demand is there.  Calling it a waste of time and money is incredibly stupid.  The game you're about to play on the 26th would not exist without them.
---
And blizzard got two extra weeks of sub out of you, fucking simpletons. Wow you got a name
---
Yeah, the moba community in general is insanely toxic. Something about those games just make people rage.

If I was running a subreddit, ppl who do this shit would get instabanned, not even kidding.

---
While you're leveling, your pet does the bulk of your damage and movement speed is your most important stat, so you go Beast Master. I prefer to take Aimed Shot after Feral Switfness and Pathfinding, then go for Bestial Wrath, but lots of people skip Aimed Shot early because it pulls aggro.
---
As you hit level cap and get gear, you'll switch to Marksman to scale your damage as it overtakes your pet's. Something roughly like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZVEohthtf0b), depending on whether you want to PvP or PvE more. Since your early gear is pretty crap, the flat AP increases from Trueshot, Imp Hunter's Mark, and Barrage are most significant. Spells like Serpent Sting and Arcane Shot start to fall off (they don't scale with weapon damage or AP).
---
When you get into the lategame and have gear, you'll switch to a Marks/Survival hybrid like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZvVo0tZIVbmohux) in order to min-max your agility/crit. A lot of the points are preference, but the important Survival nodes are Surefooted, Killer Instinct, and Lightning Reflexes, since they continue to scale with gear. Likewise, the important Marksman talents are Aimed Shot and Mortal Shots. Scatter Shot is generally better than Wyvern Sting.

I really want to do BWL again. MC &amp; Ony as well but BWL was so much fun! Plus my guild didn't really have it on farm mode like we did MC so killing Nef was still a big deal to us. I hardly got any T2 gear :( so would be cool to get more of that this time around. I was full Tier 1 though I guess. But at the same time getting into raiding is a huge time commitment. But I think it will be less of a commitment these days with knowing more about the game and people just having more resources and knowledge so won't need to be as geared and hopefully can be farming raids sooner even for just the average guild.

I don’t like cats. I would never date someone with a cat, would never allow a cat into my home, car, or office, would never allow someone with a cat to rent any of my properties (unless the law requires me to), and while sitting on the town council, found funds for local law enforcement to capture stray and feral cats and end their spread in the community.
---
I have a prejudice against cats built from experiences that if explained, anyone would understand. I’m sure there are lovely cats out there that make wonderful pets, but my personal experience means that I will never give myself the chance to care or agree. 
---
That doesn’t mean dogs are any better, but comparatively, I’ve had far fewer negative experiences with dogs and my positive experiences with dogs far eclipse the negative ones.
---
I am not prejudice against Brazilians. I am prejudice against Brazilian gamers. I’m sure there are lovely BR gamers out there that make wonderful teammates, but my personal experience means that I will never give myself the chance to care or agree.
---
That doesn’t mean Americans are any better, but comparatively, I’ve had far fewer negative experiences with Americans and my positive experiences with Americans far eclipse the negative ones.

That’s because you only experienced the game post wotlk. You haven’t see blizzard destroy a game you love over the years. There’s a reason the number of people playing was much higher back then.

Why bother though, its completely outdated.

You're right you won't have to grind for a unlock but you'll grind for cosmetic, which the allied races essentially are. They're different, but it's all in the same power level.

I jumped on the hype train as soon as Classic WoW was teased, but I've been out of the loop for the past couple of months. What's the run down on U.S. servers so far? I'm seeing a ton of memes saying some are "streamer" servers, other for hard core people or even "boomer communities".

I've played BFA profusely from release to 8.1 religiously, I stopped without experiencing 8.1 and coming back to 8.2 last week, so I admit, I may have missed some things along the way.
---
But I still think you're seeing it the wrong way, I don't believe it justifies the way that it was done. I believe you are justifying the way it was implemented with the story, where in reality there was probably a million different ways to do it, and they chose one, which conveniently fits their recent 'drip-model'.
---
But anyways, I couldn't care less for the new faction skins, so I'm not interested in debating about them, I was only criticizing the way they chose to design it, and the apparent convenient unlock pattern they decided to implement.

If at launch, Shazzrah is filled with trolls and edgy kids, it makes other new players who are edgy trolls feel more at home, while driving away other people. Meanwhile Golemagg could be pretty tame spirited at launch, which makes edgy trolls feel too noticeable and vulnerable, without a sea of “for teh lulz” people.
---
Wrath of the lich king is really where the schism startted with LFR and LFD and it was downhill from there, many people played and stopped before Wrath
---
I think you really underestimate his angle and most people do too. He's a dick/asshole on purpose because it stirs the pot, it get's people talking about him, even this post is only giving him more attention, and at the end of the day, that's what he's after.
---
He does his shtick and even the haters just fall for his ploy, it's almost genius and why I believe he tends to pull the most views. Even look at how much this sub hates streamers in general, that hate is just another thing that keeps him relevant.
---
I have Devil 😈
---
You
---
And, the realm as a whole sets the standard for acceptable behavior. If people think that some players are assholes, they will find that getting groups etc. becomes hard.
---
I need Dr. Phil!
---
he wasn't???!?!?
---
Probably better to just respec for hemo when you can. The early sub talents does 0 for your leveling speed, so you'd be gimping yourself pretty hard if you went that route.
---
Lol at the guy trying fo snipe people. Im herod us horde side
---
You aren't allowed to know til you send me a KT kill screenshot.
---
yes i do. next?
---
&gt; I spent $90 ordering energy drinks.
---
The shit dude - that's stuff unhealthy!
---
*continues sipping the 6th beer this evening*
---
There literally won't be dead servers. Just toxically overpopulated ones like Herod.
---
The whole model is garbage and doesn't work with an MMO. WoW is now an ARPG with a shared lobby.
---
I want to subscribe and play, but I want an MMORPG, not this daily loot box ARPG button smasher game.
---
Thankfully Classic is coming out, and hopefully it can reshine some light on how MMOs are supposed to be done.
---
Pservers have the real models.
---
I just got one of my friends first names as my name. He's well pissed now. So definitely worth it
---
Like whats on it or?
---
They needed a better way to do this.  Its lame that only a small select few players were able to log in and claim multiple names before anyone else.
---
Regardless of how bad it'll be how long we gonna bitch about this?
---
I’m going Mulgore as a warrior and I anticipate not being able to tag a single thing with the number of earth shocks and moon fires going on.
---
why would they make ally red and horde blue lmao
---
Even worse, you get to heaven to be told "That name is unavailable".
---
Do hunters still need Eng. to make ammo?
---
They would reeeee at that shit
---
Payo &lt;3
---
I can't wait!   Happy cake day btw!!
---
Guild officer can confirm he’s in guild
---
ah ok, thanks!
---
What’s confusing to me is that the Latin American and Brazilian players chose an east coast server. I figured they would pick a west coast server as it is geographically closer.
---
Not sure how many people here do bjj, but I got the name Kimura for my mage.
---
I get it. Like I said in another thread, I’ve had bad experiences with Russian and Chinese players in other games.
---
I think your reservation of judgement and giving everyone a fair chance to demonstrate their not assholes is all anyone can ask for.
---
Asmon is a manchild, but hes my manchild. 
---
Never seen this other guy, but looks like an unfunny tool
---
“Gold sellers hate him”
---
Fucking search it.
---
You know it's 30/21 hotw spec
---
It can do everything but is mediocre at it all and it's posted/requested multiple times every day.
---
I may be missremembering but weren't they aiming for OG realm numbers?
---
No such thing as bad publicity man, thank you.
---
I would argue that a lot of classes have had some pretty dramatic changes.
---
This video is created purely for the fun of it, im new to editing, pls no hate, i know it's mostly BFA.   
---
But it's Horde VS Alliance!   
---
27TH AUGUST GUYS!
---
Checkmate, atheists.  
---
Thanks, Obama.  
---
Please clap.

 Baby **Boomers**: Baby **boomers** were born between 1944 and 1964. They're current between 55-75 years old (76 million in U.S.) Gen X: Gen X was born between 1965 - 1979 and are currently between 40-54 years old (82 million people in U.S.) Gen Y: Gen Y, or Millennials, were born between 1980 and 1994.
---
Lmao health issues are so funny dude! Diabetes and cancer ahahahahah glaucoma ahahahah
---
Found the Boomer lol
---
So I guess I'll just ask here instead of making another thread or anything.
---
Are the servers down to reserve names by now? Or are they just going to be up until launch and you can decide to pay the sub to get names whenever you want?
---
What’s with the GTA shit?
---
Have Manatomb Herod
---
I ain't a boomer but I am definitely down with the sickness.
---
if you want to be realistic about it, there's no way to get an "authentic" experience. the world is irrevocably not the same anymore, so you might as well go with the flow.
---
If anything,  i hope they make an optional transfer/copy to a tbc server.
---
Wait how are they floating?
---
Its funnier if you do bgs and get a premade and the other side will be saying in voice coms, " KILL ME KILL ME"
---
Sadly I can't use my vanilla name.. I suck at naming things so I use the name of my current GF haha.. Well 15 years was a longggg time ago.
---
&gt; competing for kills with you
---
Small correction on this point, this isn't actually true in retail any more. As of Legion all enemies can be tapped by up to 5 people regardless of group. There are a few exceptions like world bosses, rares/elites, and such that have higher (possibly unlimited) tap counts.
---
Not to say you're wrong to complain, just wanting to clarify that.
---
Thanks. I edited my post
---
What do you have on Herod?
---
This low mod week will be the death of us
---
The only name post I care about
---
&gt; Can't RP with those names
---
Not with that attitude. I'd imagine, as a Rogue, one could disappear before peoples' eyes. That seems close enough to RP for me. :-P
---
i think itll be 3-4 months longer than in vanilla because they recognize the loss of motivation for people to raid naxx. although if theyre ging to be releasing naxx again in classic wotlk maybe they dont mind that
---
Actually excited to see Ninja and Dr. Disrespect playing classic WoW. They have a younger audience and could bring new players to the game
---
If they made a mankrik server it would break the game. You can't have 100% of the player base on one server.
---
It would be an honor to come across you in-game
---
It took me a minute to realise this wasn't someone making a STONKS meme.
---
I have a spreadsheet from reddit i found that i can give you. Its a bit over the top for me and not all the info is 100% correct.
---
I hope but I doubt it.
---
I think I have TBC one as well still, I also have my wow classic atlas.
---
My buddy uses the character name Dishes everywhere we go and ever since I can remember he never has been able to lock it and always has to go with Disheslol or some alternative.
---
Obviously he didn't get it so if anyone is just holding it on Herod I'd love to grab it for him otherwise no worries I'm sure some other people also use that tag
---
Wait until the super toxic Spanish coalition arrives. It is (not) going to be fun!
---
Because its "Iolcow" not "Lolcow"
---
lmao if this somehow manages to offend you, i sure hope you never, ever leave your house, goddamn
---
Goose?
---
We wait..
---
Yes.  Do this.
---
Yeah for each layer size not for total server size
---
Right on that cusp.
---
After running around the world and feeling its scale, noticing your character progress every single level, having to think and learn while leveling, and not seeing flashy gear/mounts/abilities everywhere constantly, you will probably get it.
---
Retail WoW is fun, but it's all flash and no substance for a lot of us.
---
Selling names? Really. Get a job hippie.
---
Really? I played a paladin named Darnassus for almost 2 years, and still have it
---
Dude, quiet, I’m tryna get that streamer money. Stop ruining my plan.
---
I've been wondering about whitemane, I hope it will have a sizable player base though
---
Pally pally buffs... I can live with this
---
My poor Orc Warrior was born at the wrong time. He will be forever stuck in retail.
---
Buying cool OG names on SHAZZRAH or GOLEMAGG ..   
---
Add me on DISCORD Sweezy#0420 and let's see what you can offer me :)
---
Everyone had connecting to game server untill they were thrown into queue, some were at 700 others at 15k some at 3k. There is no need to speculate on numbers based on an anecdote.
---
Ftfy: Ex-Gf
---
You turn into Pablo Escobar when you're waiting?
---
I've entered in both Shazzrah's and Golemagg's Discord server and what a difference... While Golemagg was chill and cool, and you could have a matture conversation with people, Shazzrah was completelly filled with memes and a lot of kids just talking like if it was Asmongold's twitch chat, completely rubbish. (and btw, most of them are complaining about spaniards but they seem to be a lot worse)
---
​
---
I'm still thinking about going Shazzrah because all my friends are going there, but this turned me off. I just want to know how much do you think this will affect my gameplay. I guess I will focus on joining a non-toxic guild ASAP.
---
I wouldn't like having to change to another realm days after the release because I'd feel like I've lost time and I've lost the launch experience.
---
Yeah but  you cant move in shadow meld so you just gotta creep until someone shows up
---
Grob gamer here
---
Any advice? I am very interested in doing that. I assume you will control the pally mainly? and just have frost bolt spam on mage?
---
Roll Zandalar. I really would encourage people to not be put off by the RP bit. It's going to be by far the most enjoyable server, a decent size without much layering and nowhere near as many idiots.
---
Kralnor?
---
Can’t wait till the “servers are down; not sure when they’ll be up” happens, for that authentic feel.
---
It was actually lower in classic but still growing. Classic pop peaked around 1.1m or something, I forget. It really started picking up steam end half of TBC when everything was mostly fixed. Then it went bananas in Wrath.
---
It is, which is 11BST (UK) on the 26th.
---
my solution is removing layering
---
Just want to give you a little heads up, but 30 pts in survival and 21 in marks is actually a great dps &amp; pvp spec with some stuff shuffled around. 
---
It pulls more dps in raids but your guild will likely want you to bring Trueshot aura to the table. If you get lucky and have 2 hunters in the same group within a raid, then you'll want one of them to be survival for the self-agi bonuses.
---
Even if it happens (long shot) its at LEAST two years away
---
I managed to reserve Healer and Damage. Going to go put on a lottery ticket now brb
---
This is no ordinary streamer server. It has literally all the big streamers. For one the que times will most likely be the longest, a lot of the chats will have twitch spam. 
---
Just the fact that big part of the server is a bunch of fanboys is no fun ether.
---
*Joins group* 
---
First question: "so who do you watch?"
---
If you really like the thought of streamer events sure go for it but if you're not planning to participate in them then you might want to rethink.
---
Hey everyone, we got the spokesperson for the Asmon's followers. Apparently they're super smart and see through Asmon's "fake" persona. Big brain people.
---
What server are you on because holy crap that paladin is IDENTICAL to my own. I realize there are not many customization options in Classic WoW so you will have characters that look similar, but what I'm trying to say is IDENTIFY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE, JIM, MILLIONS OF FAMILIES SUFFER EVERY YEAR. (I'm HealingPants on Pagle, btw. lol)
---
Oh it will forsure
---
Haha i appreciate the offers, but not really interested in any of those.
---
What's the next cool number?
---
I guess 300
---
Yoy just massively contradicted yourself dude. "had nothing to do with herods players claiming sever/asking streamers not to come" "the streamers didn't go there to not piss them off"
---
So the fact so many people were vocal against streamers on herod is the exact reason they didn't land there.
---
I personally think the whole thing is retarded and you herod players are lucky the streamers didn't say "fuck you"
---
I believe they said they'd put warnings up for people who try to create characters on servers with inordinately high pops.
---
Betray the alliance. Join us on the Horde.
---
At least we will get that classic experience
---
In addition to this, lots of lore characters are also blacklisted. Typically, you can't create "Thrall" or "Jaina" or "Anduin" etc. as new characters.
---

Good sir. I have corrected some  of the spelling mistakes in your  post that shows of great intelligence by not cursing. Also the threatening with violence shows great class.
---
Hats of to you for this post, it is a revelation to us all.
---
I sincerely apologise if I missed some spelling fixes because they were too much, but I understand a enlightened mind like yours wil forgive my insulence.
---
imo one vanilla did the best was sense of gear quality. You excited about your first green, blue and purple item. 
---
In retail Legendaries can be bought on the auction house.. its just not the same. Theres many thing retail has improved on but the sense of gear quality and character progress is not one of them.
---
"Thatonemage, knock it off!" Ya, that'll do.
---
And keep in mind this isn’t a problem on retail. 
---
In fact, you can do exactly what your describing here without even switching servers. 
---
Wonder why people aren’t freaking out there? 🤔🤔
---
I got Cheesus the Priest. Happy as fuck!
---
There’s a profanity name list and a reserved name list, both of which have some wildcard strings.

Here’s the list for anyone interested. Found it on this sub (I think) some time ago. Not sure how up to date it is; my guess would be that it’s old. 
---

---
A week to settle before Classic launches is really going to be nice.
---
&gt; Okay throw on a tabard and go do some dungeons.
---
That was actually a Wrath system. In BC the tabards were a reward for reaching exalted, not a tool for helping get there. It was a damn good system too, don't know why they'd toss it out. World quests are a lot less fun for rep than being able to run dungeons.
---
I'm more used to that 96 life
---
I honestely liked Daily Quests when they were introduced in TBC, they weren't that long, took like 2 hours max to do, and you had different type of quests, which were like little mini-games sometimes. You did these and the rest of your time was free, if you were in a somewhay casual guild, these quests gave you enough gold to get pots, flasks and food for 3 days of progress raiding, at least on my server, so they just made up for grinding.
---
you already said that, i'm asking what's your solution to the problem layering is trying to solve.
---
Nope. Login servers don’t have Layers, so of course they’re going to be bogged down. Once we’re in game, everything should be fine. Most people didn’t have connection issues with name reservation, they just didn’t like waiting.
---
May these servers be free of the harsh reigns of captain planet and all of his CP wrath.
---
You can’t block my shtoyle
---
i completely support this. it's baffling that in 2019 we still can't just choose the language we want to use.
---
Herod is the best and only server worth playing on.
---
The single thing Retail does better than Classic is the fact that it has Blood Elves lol
---
But that's not hypocrisy............
---
Thats just your choice in what would you rather do
---
This is not correct. You can play with cheap Russian subscription on English servers. If you would buy Russian VPN and fake your country in your account, you can pay 50% less right now. Nothing restricts you from that (other than fear of being banned, I guess).

Good things take time. It took my friend 13 hours on BFA release to reach 120 from 110. It doesn't feel like progress, it's just a point off the check list and you move right along.
---
i have to say i’m a little surprised Blozzard didn’t put the streamers names on a banned list of names to avoid griefing them.  If you name yourself Asmongold it’s only to grief him.
---
They never release that info. 
---
You can look st the stickies reddit survey to get an idea. Or 3rd party sites once game releases
---
The brain is the only tool you need
---
Better set the layering to hyperdrive!
---
Cheers mate :)
---
RiP Don Vito
---
No.
---
World of Dragon Quest
---
So are there only 4 NA PvP servers? 2 eastern 2 pacific right
---
My guess is they kept vodka safe cause of the guild?
---
And I just told you Blizzard confirmed they are correct, pservers had it wrong
---
Yes, and the playlist is called "Treadmaul" because it was my workout / PVP go to

How
---
Adds to reroll the other faction to camp you list.
---
Like Hulk, smash.. it rolls off the tongue!
---
I got it :)
---
Just give me one million dollars.
---
Yeah I get it.
---
I don't even disagree they're annoying. Just hoping it won't be so bad.
---
LF It on Shazzrah.
---
So are we just going to be in a constant circle jerk over streamers? Cool.
---
I tried to get Oi on Herod, since I'm Aussie - but I was too slow. Tried at a few other random two letter names as well though no luck, I figured people would be swarming them.
---
I wanted to log into Hydraxian Waterlords but I forgot my password
---
So did I. Then I hurt my ankle, it's been 2 months and it hasn't fully healed. This is life now.
---
Yeah whitemane has been meme'd and sexualized, yet it's still just medium pop. My theory is that classic WoW players are mostly adults, and not teens, so that stuff doesn't matter as much anymore.
---
Spellstone &gt; Firestone, come on.
---
Also Soda already said he's going to zerg to like 10 and then level all the way to 60 in dungeons to help avoid the spergs and fighting for tags
---
But once they start hitting like level 20+ the spergs who are only there to try and get the attention of streamers will be left in the dust anyways so.
---
The reason you feel validations need for validation though?
---
I have Jr, was my name on lightbringer 🤪
---
If you actually look around you'll notice every server is pretty quiet except all the spergs on Herod. That's where all the idiots assembled. 
---
For reference of potential problems
---
 Faerlina: Streamers, fucktons of them. 
---
Herod: Loud annoying spergs crying about streamers, fucktons of them. 
---
Thalnos: LA/BR players, fucktons of them.
---
Whitemane: several 4chan guilds, beware
---
Fairbanks: Shh go away, you didn't see us.
---
GoleChad is the server you wanna roll on ;)
---
Whitemane is supposedly 4chan whatever that means.

you just can’t get the staff these days!
---
The Sons of Hodir rep grinds were a lot of fun. At least Wrath dailies had some creativity to them.
---
Yes. Rip.
---
It's not hard to compete the first play session. Especially since they'll get swarmed, and need to go create a guild, etc.
---
What's the point for making a post like this?
---
I think everyone from the opposing faction should be just generic named like orc warrior, orc rogue, undead mage. Until they gain enough honor to be known by the opposite faction.
---
One more thing to wait for.  star wars episode 9, Rick and Morty,  Birth of my child, Winds of Winter. You know the big life events.
---
Am i the only one that thinks there is gonna be some major glitch and we didnt actually get shit?
---
the internet has sped up the changing of words - literally. or figuratively. who knows anymore ... but I'm not gonna die on the 'boomer' hill
---
not at all, blizzard will open new servers when they realize how badly they screwed up only having 3est pvp servers.    and anyone who doesnt wanna sit in queue will reroll.
---
Curious, what's with the island stuff? I have no clue about what they're for and what good they bring
---
This is exactly what I thought to myself yesterday after I got my three characters created.
---
Titles aren't allowed in names, such as King, Queen, Duke, Lord, etc.
---
Hex, Grief, Fatality.
---
On ~~Herod~~Myzrael.  Whoops.
---
Good luck with the Dementors
---
Ok..You win this one.
---
The people's server!
---
Doubt nerds like you could land punches
---
The launch day is two weeks ahead,  why ppl are so worried i dont get it..
---
Kiz_the_shiz can you not. 
---
Yeah that’s pretty cringe there.
---
But yesterday was a success(?)
---
amen brother.
---
I've actually abandoned my main on retail in favor of leveling a druid just to go back and do old content farms. I'm basically going to use that to fund my token to cover my classic sub :D
---
How'd you like Once Upon A Time in Hollywood?
---
There is no way that Brazilian playerbase goes under 4k players. And no+ way that the 7 big Latin American countries combined dont go over 4k either. And the Latin American community doesnt participate in the kinda "official" pools like the one in this sub reddit.
---
I took two names for me, then the last one for my arch nemesis on Nost.
---
You'll never have the name martock, NEVER! Atleast not on herod.
---
I believe Broken Tooth is the only pet to have a 1.0 attack speed until the ZG bats are added later on
---
It seems to have been smooth sailing for some, and for others, not-so-much.  It took my husband 51 mins to log in, he kept getting disconnected.  I got in twice (two different accounts) before he got in.  But you're right, I'm a little worried.  I might just skip launch day, or the first few days.
---
Yeah it doesn't really make sense lol
---
Yet we don't know for sure, do we? Seems to be speculations based on Discord numbers and various communities announcing Shazzrah as their realm choice?
---
Not sure if it's an indication of anything, but when name reservation opened yesterday Golemagg was the first server to reach "high" population. Also, at launch it may have an advantage of being the first PvP realm on the realm list due to it's name - the people who did not decide realm before launch will see it before Shazzrah.
---
Is this the reason why the server has High pop
---
Yeah, Boomer has become a rotating age group instead of a definitive one. It's the 26-31 age range where you stop acting like a young 20-something, and start acting more like your parents and/or a responsible adult and doing stereotypical dad/mom shit
---
[Here is an example of him being himself.](https://youtu.be/SfRzayuhiow?t=37)
---
Concurrent players reached as high as 8 million when BC was launched.
---
From my understanding they will be up till before launch.
---
I don't actually. This is the first time I've been able to get Jelly in any game. I normally go with Jellysquid or Squidbert, but during TBC I somehow managed to get Jellyfish for my draenei shammy
---
All the more reason why you don't want to be on the streamer server. It's basically WoW meets the Kardashians meets Jersey Shore
---
Alright, horde or alliance is basically up to what group of races you fancy. Have a look at the character creation screen. 
---
The difference between PvE and PvP is that you can attack/be attacked by players of the other faction in most locations (aside from the starting zones and your factions cities). I favor PvP since it gives a whole 'nother edge to the gameplay where you will need to be awake when roaming the "contested" zones. 
---
PvE realms generally (and if the recent polls are anything to go by) have problems with faction balance. Of course, this could also be a problem for PvP realms and is hard to see before the realm has had a few months under its belt.
---
The PvP/PvE thing has been better explained by others but the gist of it is basically that you need to figure out whether you are a carebear or if you like some danger.
---
My crystal ball says every pvp server will be horde sided because they always are in vanilla
---
This is the first MMO launch I've been actually hyped about in forever, first game I followed for two years (!) in development, played in early access, waited up to reserve names, the whole thing. I feel like I'm luck never having played vanilla because I get to experience it all as a truly new game and discover everything for the first time as it was back in the beginning.
---
At first when the 2017 announcement happened I was just like, wow, this is a great move, of course I'll try it when it's out. Then I got sucked into it, especially at the end when I finally got to play it a bit in the stress tests, since I never started until very late in the retail game and missed out on vanilla and all the great expansions back in the day.
---
Now for the first time in years and years I have a game that I think about playing all the time even when I'm not playing it. And based on the number of people who were around for the last test, and how the live realms were beaten into the ground by the name res crowds, it seems like it's going to be one of the biggest launches I've been able to personally take part in, even being a re-release and not a brand new game.
---
Good time to be alive and an MMO fan for sure.
---
You've got it backwards dude.  In classic raiding is required for end game, there is no solo/casual path to get end game gear.  In retail there are many different casual solo ways to gear up and participate in end game content.
---
If you don't raid in classic you'll have half the HP pool and do a fraction of the damage of those that do...so you're essentially a punching bag for raiders.
---
Kapi, the priest. Or bandicoot the druid
---
I think it's too far gone and we will end up with two versions of wow going their own ways
---
Wow you seem really jaded and biased.
---
this is some weird ass wholesome shit, I'm not sure that belongs on reddit.
---
Anyone with a 2 letter name on shazzrah pm me
---
Also pvp gear is have more stam while pve had more other stats iirc? Fact check me please
---
Kiting*

Haha there was a happy ending!

Oh. I don't think you are aware of what a model is. This item is not a model changer [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18660/world-enlarger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18660/world-enlarger)

Cant say I mind any of it too much. Though Im not a huge fan of people, especially our parents generation, calling us millennial's with an obvious hint of venom. As though we are ruining the world. (They raised us, afterall)

Then, as a total Boomer--Im reminded of The Who - My Generation "Poeple try to put us down | Just because we get around | Things they do look awful cold | I hope I die before I get old"
---
Look, rmt is still bad; you need specify “for gold”.
---
Ah, surely we must be brethren then, for I am of the same ilk.
---
I just feel like English is a lot more expressive as a language.
---
Very true. I'm just paranoid. I was in the server within 10 minutes and my entire list of 20 names were taken. I wasn't taking any more chances.
---
Yea, this felt very reminiscent of my experience with the deadmines.
---
Other things I remember:
---
* clearing my way down through the elites to get to the entrance
---
* getting lost
---
* one guy was late, and when he appeared, the elites respawned- we can to go back and get him
---
* one of the pirates running at low health and agro-ing two more
---
* getting a parrot as a pet
---
Or for the alliance a horror movie

Disc is a highly unique ball of wax. It essentially gets a new identity every single expansion. I do agree, though, that it was some of the most satisfying gameplay that WoW has offered in a while. I really don't think most DPS classes have better rotations than in early WoW. When nearly *every* single DPS class relies on builders and spenders, it cheapens them all.
---
I saw towelliee is going pagle
---
Were you Arcana or Arcanah on original Nostalrius?
---
On Herod I have Envy, Lethal, Xp
---
All name reservation posts should be deleted.
---
I feel you hoping someone in the guild imma be joining wants some company if not its gonna be a lonely grind.
---
&gt; Also, I would like to dps&gt;heal primarily. I wouldn't mind healing here and there but thats not what I enjoy.
---
Go Mage.
---
Shaman will be healing 99% of the time in PvE. Enhance is fun in PvP, but if you're primarily looking to DPS in raids don't go Shaman.
---
I don't get off work until pretty late so I think I might be kind of screwed at 60 because it's hard to make raid times.  My endgame may just be getting pre-bis and pvp gear, but I'm ok with that.
---
They had the gnome models wrong, that's a fact. You don't even care to look into it. Good luck mate.
---
And here I thought he was just blessing the Catholic church's kiddie porn backups.
---
If you think that is an issue that will be unique to Thalnos.... you are in for a real treat my friend.
---
Yeah I'd also not enjoy running into Danes, that's a good point!
---
Joking aside, I did the same thing, I'll probably just keep doing the same thing.
---
There are kids in college who legitimately do not understand the concept of shutting down a laptop normally, they either close the lid all the time (30+ days of uptime, anyone?) or hard-shutdown by holding the power button once in a blue moon.

RDP into your home pc and begin the queue prior to commuting home.
---
caffeine makes you crash rookie. "healthy" energy packed foods like eggs, nuts, fish, avacado etc water will keep you up for days.  caffeine is for the final push only.
---
They're still in the minority on thalnos lol they'd prob get a server if they could even populate one. stop spreading lies.
---
Not to be a dumbass, but how do you create an accented letter without the numpad? I mean, other than copy/pasting from a list or something, nothing comes to mind for me... I had laptops in the past that couldn't create special characters and it drove me bonkers as a writer; I had to force autocorrection in Word so that words like café came out right (without it interrupting my typing flow by having to manually find it and enter it). Was there a better way all this time?
---
its a 15 year old "Solved" game. Dont ruin it for yourself. Just go experience it. There will be plenty of time to research the nitty gritty later
---
I played during vanilla -I've always known why.  I am reminded of exactly how it felt while I played the stress test.
---
If you plan on raiding on shaman it's healer 99% of the time, finding a spot with other specs is going to take a lot of investment or just won't be viable for early phases.
---
Ele and Enh start seeing some play in pvp and can be good, but raiding wise they're are pretty inexistant, you might have one, but it'll be more for the buffs than what you can do, enhancement can be used as an offtank on some small mechanics when needed with the spec but it won't go much further, on the otherhand, with a big 2h or sulfuras, eventually in pvp you'll be able to instagib people, bit it's really hit or miss.
---
The only proven viable longterm spec is resto.
---
Mage is okay at first with not much option other than frost for MC, during which you'll be able to easily AoE farm gold in blizzard spec, but once AQ passes casters are going to get better scaling and will be able to heavily compete.
---
Not in the near future.
---
alright :D
---
Right, yeah. There are some good PVE servers that are completely free of the server mess.
---
I agree. The reason I hate wow today is because there’s no challenge. When you grind like in classic, you actually learn your class, you learn the value of a dollar (or gold) and you appreciate the time invested. Me and my entire group of people I started wow with in vanilla are all creating our old guild again and trying to get in touch with our old guildies. I believe this relaunch will have old players coming from the woodwork in a heartbeat without question.
---
This is somehow worse, thanks
---
Okay, but do you keep WoW running in the background for the music, and check in every now and again to see the hours in the hover tooltip go down?
---
I really just want to punch his teeth out. And I’ve  no idea about any of the streamer drama either.  His voice and face... just need my foot deeply imbedded.
---
vQueue to the rescue
---
Negative.  My first pick was going to be Archon but that was gone within seconds apparently.  Arcana was just choice number 2.
---
Spend ten minutes on this sub and you'll realize why you don't want to play with one
---
Yeah, I was also thinking it is "just when you think you are safe and near your buddies"
---
The ratio according to the data has gotten better.
---
For previous opening binges, I have gone for Rockstar Hydration Lemonades, as well as Monster Zeros. And I don't think I can do either of those ever again. The initial day is ok, but the following day, regardless of how much water I drink along with it, I have a massive headache and I just feel like garbage. I feel ok after a couple cups of coffee and going outside a little.        
---
       
---
I am either going black coffee or just caffeine pills. And a multivitamin.
---
Thats a great name!
---
&gt; Post or pre- WF nerf?
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; Because WF used to be able to stack on WF and hypothetically speaking if all the stars aligned, you can WF off of WF and WF off of that WF. So that is 9 hits in one hit.
---
&gt; Post WF nerf- you are kinda forced to go ele, and ele does a lot of damage burst. Moreso than pally and druid.
---
post WF nerf, by the way when I say enh I mean 20/30/0.
---
Obv a crit parsing ranged ele destroys everything in sight but thats a different topic.
---
You clearly made a mistake.  That asshat is holding his phone horizontally, like god intended.  A real asshat would be holding the phone vertically.
---
95% of the WoW playerbase doesn't participate in these polls... or even visit Reddit or the WoW Forums.  We are the tryhards here and we all know how quickly Reddit likes to start circlejerking... this whole Thalnos is a lost cause thing is just the most recent.
---
Everything. Even NPCs...I'm a warrior.
---
What do you mean quieter than herod?
---
Install a buff addon &gt; hit 1 button all raid = profit
---
That's true
---
Like that idea tbh just go with it thanks for responding
---
Can we expect The Return of That Which Has No Life?
---
Yeah, I prefer PvE and I'm sure I'm gonna have a relatively stable server experience.
---
Ahh okay, makes sense
---
I've enjoyed Punkrat recently and as someone else said Nobbel is 100% legit imo.

It's just entertainment relating to games people like. You don't need to get it or watch them.
---
So lemme get this right. You’d rather not be able to play than play with layering?
---
Guess what, you have that option.
---
Thanks, I was teetering between the two but I think I'll just main a mage and if I find more time to level an alt I'll roll a shaman later on.
---
It is worse, cause it feels like you have to play a minigame while playing the game instead of focusing on whats happening in the raid/dungeon.
---
Low-moderation-week is currently in effect.
---
Ok, with 4-8hrs per week it'll only take OP 50 years to grind exalted, and he's never getting rank14 with that playtime.  Also that content doesn't drop until Phase3, which may be convenient because that'll be around the time OP will be hitting 60 with his 4-8hr/wk playtime lol.
---
You can't do dungeons and be geared...you can do dungeons and maybe have 1 or 2 pieces of loot depending on class and the rest blues and greens.
---
You're the only person spitting shit in here kiddo, and its pretty obvious you have no idea what you're talking about.  Its well known that classic is not a game for casuals, and never was, unless you're an RPer or don't give a fuck about being a punching bag for raiders.
---
Honestly if they did it this way i feel like everyone gets to have their cake and eat it too
---
Their may be server transfers at some point (was in Vanilla) but there will definitely not be race and faction changes my dude.
---
I thought we weren’t allowed to talk about Alex on this sub? Isn’t it a bannable offense?
---
It seems really tough to keep an MMO progressing forever without making the progression feel meaningless.

Perhaps cow is a bad example because it's a Tauren meme, it may an exception as I mentioned. How about 'red' vs 'redeyes'?

---
Is everyone dodging Faerlina because of the streamers? 4000 on Herod surprised me with that amount.
---
Yeah sorry man I really don’t find her attractive
---
Yup, I think PVE servers will be a great launch experience.
---
Yeah, there's a difference between accents being used correctly and not.
---
Correct: it's an original spelling/correct spelling of a word that by default has an accent in it.
---
Not Wrong: the sound is correct in IPA
---
Wrong: Random accents just to get the letter beneath the accent.
---
Is this the next baseless panic attack this sub is gonna have?
---
Streamers all mostly went to Faerlina.
---
Goddamn your dense.
---
My blizzard ID has been Moisty Flaps for years. Blizzard doesnt care
---
Just use the Wowhead dressing room.
---
I always thought it was on purpose, they clearly did this with blizzard together and even the character said he was a hunter when humans  at the time couldnt even be hunters xD.
---
I believe so.
---
So you like everything about Alliance and the only thing you like from Horde is WotF.. And you're willing to leave friends behind?
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com
---
Retail tells you when, what and for how long you can do something. It's a theme park.
---
It's this artificial content availability aka gatekeeping that people hate so much about retail.
---
I thought that playing on Alliance, as an alt, might be fun. Then I saw that Towellie is there.   
---
***NOPE***.
---
Me and my 6 friends are rolling ally, so we should be good.
---
Pretty sure you copy over your wdb/wtf and addon folders, renaming the account/character name to the new ones. But it's been a while...
---
You should grab "Himself" as a name.  So you can see such things as "Kaizenno defeated Himself!"
---
We cannot allow real-money transactions to be discussed on this subreddit. It's low-mod-week, but, we don't want to be held responsible for y'all getting rooked. Also might be against Blizzard's TOS as a note. Point being, take real-money offers elsewhere / don't do it here.
---
I like names that are based on the thing that person does the most..
---
I actually have a dog named claw and a parrot named noob (because he is clumsy).
---
Actually the parrot also calls everyone else noob as well, which I love.
---
What's the appeal in having a name of two random letters? Just wondering
---
Short names with single word guild names are also much more aesthetically pleasing than some nonsense name. 
---
But again, its all my opinion. Thats the great thing about names, they are totally in the eye of the beholder.
---
I’ll PM ya!
---
If you actually do it from lvl one getting to max level in retail isn't super duper fast. Those awful TBC areas alone take awhile to get through.
---
Posts about streamers in general or an important event hosted or caused by streamers is okay. “This streamer said this about other streamer” is not.
---
I resubbed a few days ago and tried WoW for the first time since cata. I was honestly shocked by a lot of changes, such as that most of my spells didn’t even require mana etc. I also got my first level (86) in about 5 quests and one bg, it was utterly ludicrous.
---
I did enjoy some things though. I rolled a demon hunter, and the starting quest chain thing was really fun and well made (and playing as a demon hunter was tons of fun too). The problem is that although being fun it’s not even slightly challenging, so the initial enjoyment soon wears off. 
---
I also used the free character boost that Blizzard gave me to upgrade a character to 100, and I did the opening quest chain thing for Legion (the one for every class except demon hunters) and that was also pretty fun. I liked all the cutscenes and story etc. 
---
Anyway I thought I might end up playing it for a couple of weeks until Classic but I got bored super fast. Plus, I thought it would be nice to see the zones but the xp gains were so fast that i only saw one part of a MoP zone and I was 90 already (I did a few dungeons and some BGs). I’m not really sure how people are still invested in this game but I guess it’s enjoyable for a lot of people. 
---
Sorry I ended up writing tons and I doubt anyone will even read it. Haha.
---
What do you gain by responding to this post like that?
---
He definitely alluded to being the best warrior dueler or 1v1 or something asinine like that .
---
Anyone with an active sub will play be able to play. The BR Facebook group comprised of 4K going to Thalnos alone. This doesn’t include the ones not part of the FB group nor the SA players originating from Ragnaros and elsewhere.
---
Yeah no thanks. Thalnos is the unofficial BR/SA server as far as I can see. I’d rather not take the risk because we all know what happened to Warsong. And if you don’t, then just look to Azralon, Ragnaros and Quel’thalas.
---
LF Edelgard on Whitemane. Hubert needs his Empress.
---
so say you. I like it a lot.
---
Yeah you’re pretty much a sperg if you play and have a stream in the background LOL. That would be like me playing chess and then having a chess stream in the background.... yeah no.

Of course launch day will be a fucking mess but in hoping it will settle by 1 in the morning when people start logging off. I legit have my sisters wedding sunday and classic launches Monday at 6. I plan on staying up untill 6 in the morning than getting up at 3, take a shower, go get food/dominoes pizza and drinks. Going to be so much fun no matter what.
---
"Passion project" lmao. Do you even know how bussinesses work? What Activision does to make money? If Classic becomes popular enough, they will make it their cash machine, and this sub will be the first place to defend it. Also, your "evidence" are words that game developers said to, guess what: Sell their product better. It wouldn't be the first time companies lied about monetization in their games. It isn't just Activision- Bethesda did it too with Fallout 76
---
Live streaming changes the environment of the game, ESPECIALLY when it comes to world bosses and PVP servers. Get into a fight with someone you dont realize is a streamer? Youre going to be hunted down and harassed by dozens of petty troll followers who have nothing better to do just because they can. 
---
The one streamer people are particularly trying to avoid has even admitted that he will start arguments with people until they say something bad just to have a reason to report them. 
---
Like yeah I dont care about them personally nor do I watch them but when you have 20 some streamers all going to the same server and each of them have hundreds or thousands of viewers who will be following them, it changes server balance dramatically. Thats why it mattered to people.
---
As a vanilla player, I was definitely focused on hitting high 50's ASAP, then it was possible to work on gearing up through dungeons from like 55-60. I was definitely not worried about exploring the world or anything before leveling/gearing. I think they may be some nostalgia goggle effect going on.
---
Idk porkbutt always makes me laugh when I say my name
---
do the alt key code names still work with classic?
---
Some of us stopped playing WoW before that guy was a thing. Haven't watched anything related to WoW for 9 or 10 years because I had no reason to follow a game I didn't enjoy anymore. A few months ago his face shows up on my suggested section and I clicked on it. I guess you know the rest of the story.
---
Don't care much about him but I understand why people don't want to play on the same server as him or any of the big streamers.
---
Wanted Reaper, Death, or Nightmare on Herod. Didn't get a single one, or my following 4 choices.
---
I was going to say it nice but.  Most of the names posted so far are the suck.
---
I have nothing against streamers, watch them every now and then. Still, I don't think you can roll on Faerlina and "don't care about streamers". You roll there and you simply have to care about them, end of story.  I recommend to change server.
---
Of course in case you join the guild Blacklisted and go there to gank them forever after, then sure Faerlina is the server for you.
---
I hear ya. It did allow me on some low level characters I've done since Legion to see the whole story of a zone that I'd never seen before.
---
and i care why
---
I don't think you know how tea works my dude
---
THANK YOU

I was excited for my first grey cloak, don’t get me started on the shoulders! Totally agree with you mate
---
Well in TBC just _running_ the dungeon got you rep. I liked the tabard system a lot though.
---
Eye contact is key
---
Of course you would... everyone would... but, again, having a shitter in your group who you have to kick and replace... even after explaining to them what to fix... will not be a problem unique to any 1 server.
---
I'm gonna play, not watch someone else play. And as for the smart ass mentioning monitor 2 - first not everybody has one, second I work while I play. I'm watching conferences and thinking of my draft for the associated report.

You said “the launch won’t be smooth if I miss out on social interactions because I’m on a different layer”
---
I asked “what does social interactions have to do with a smooth launch”
---
Either answer the question or stop responding

Ty!!

Still calling it that the streamers are gonna bait and switch to end up on Herod.

Was thrilled to get that name

inb5 name pics 'funny' 'original' and 'special'

layering shapes the game experience of all players and the community as a whole. It won't be the same.

I made 4, but deleted the 4th. I made a 3rd name I wanted, it said there was an error and the name was taken. So then I made a 4th that was a clone of the third but with a different name. Turns out it made both so I just deleted the clone
---
Love it.  Would be even better as a rogue.

Names are blocked based on a database table called NamesProfanity. Each entry is an ID, a regular expression (a word pattern) and an associated language.

"Urmom" is probably written as-is which blocks all names with it inside, like Urmom, Fukurmom and Urmomsuks.

Sure, but when I made the comment (and I've just checked and it's the same right now also), Shazzrah has High pop and Golemagg has Medium pop, with all other English realms having Low pop.

Did you just unironically call someone a snowflake?
---
How about you go to the release schedule on the main site? Explains all of this with pretty animations and images so people like you can even understand.

Which is crazy when the game gets most fun 40-60 with talents

incorrect it launches at the same time everywhere

---
&gt; Sure, you might say "Well there were people reserving names that won't actually play right away." True. And there's also people that will play right away that didn't care about reserving names last night.
---
I would even think that the later group will be the larger group, especially considering a large part of that group haven't even subbed yet and will only do so on the day of or before.
---
I think Prowler falls into the exception category, like you said it has meaning and specifically with your class. Words like ‘Cord’ and ‘paper’ don’t have a lot of meaning.
---
Our pungent Grandfather wears many faces
---
Not only do you need to level a new character, you cannot create a character on the opposite faction on that server. So you would have to delete your level 60 or buy a new subscription for a 2nd account to make a different faction on the same server
---
Yeah not gonna lie but worried about if they end up fucking it all up somehow with some magical way to make more money off it or some other bullshit, let’s hope not eh.
---
This is exactly my problem with retail.  
---
I played a lot on 8.0, logged back in these days and discovered anyone could get past my ilvl with a couple of hours of mindless world quests. So I looked back at the trend and saw it was the way blizzard intended. One patch immediately renders the previous one obsolete and provides catch up so you can bypass it completely.  
---
I was left with the feeling of "What's the point?". Classic does have some catch up mechanics here and there, but nowhere near the absurd levels of retail.
---
Why wouldn't he feel he earned it? I think that actually working is harder than grinding in WoW in your free time

Wait...  you are so stubborn that you chose to create on Herod with everyone else instead of choosing a different server...  so why do YOU want more servers if YOU are insistent on playing on Herod?
---
I'm not sure a heal 100 yards away from the mob causes threat
---
A casual player can at least see the raid in LFR.  There's no way someone who plays 6hrs a week on average can raid...

I made a char on Whitemane and live East Coast. Are you doing the same? I'm also curious which servers may favor alliance...

I raided as ret at 60. I also finished raiding at 60 with around -200 dkp but was one of the best gear players in my guild. Perks of everyone in the raid liking you (minus the raid leader)

Roll need on bow items. 5 levels of someone getting 3% more dmg is not worth letting go of a free mount.

Yes you will. You just won't get geared. No point in giving a ret gear over the warriors.

Same here. If there's one streamer that's worse than all the other streamers combined it's Alexensual.
---
Full out Naxx gear and pvp awh yeah
---
There are two types of people here lol
---
Because in retail OP is out of content once he dings 60 and does his dungeons, while in retail he has a plethora of options?  Are you dense?
---
hell nah I'll probably quit after clearing it unless if they announce something follow up.
---
It's a great raid but it's not worth farming the consumes for it, and pvp blows with naxx gear.
---
Good one, that'll show em!
---
I suspect layering will ruin any fun world pvp that would otherwise go down on Herod, at least without lots of “inv to asmon layer”
---
Of course it is.
---
No one cares
---
People seem to always equate retail with classic, failing to realize that they just aren’t the same game. Even when TBC launched, it wasn’t the same game. And it’s been progressing into different iterations with the same root.
---
It’s akin to the progression of Mario games. Vanilla is like SMB1, retail is like Mario Odyssey. One can still have fun with Odyssey, but can’t expect it to be the SMB1 of yesteryear.

The more popular a game is, the longer your name has to be to find a pronounceable combination of letters that isn't taken. I made an OSRS account the other day and ended up with "Elialasuli," which isn't ideal. Anyone who wants a two or three syllable name should probably be reserving it.
---
Have ya tried the [Shazz discord](https://discord.gg/Jn4F68Q)? Beware of the edgelords there (or so I have been told).
---
Stoked y'all got rosen man.
---
I think Bflo is gonna work wonders for y'all.
---
Thanks in advance to the Ooga gang on Farelina
---
Physically being able to play the game is the #1 thing.
---
Beyond that, no lag, no crashes etc.
---
Without layering you resort to massive server ques and server instability which means people can’t play which means it’s not a smooth launch, 
---
Idc how many servers you launch Herod will be full on launch without layering.
---
Wild guess, RP server?
---
I got Si, it's what people call me irl. I like it
---
Caffeine is for the weak minded.
---
Its Portuguese, not Spanish, and will realistically be about 10% of the server. I think the Spanish LATAM communities are going to Faerlina.
---
Snag-it ftw
---
Only if they release balance patchs.
---
I have a friend that can definitely don't 60 in a week. He loves this game on a level I never will.
---
quiet, dont let on about us.
---
Horde actually, never played alliance that high so no comparison. It's not even really the zone design that I have a problem with so much as the mechanics
---
Hello there, I am looking to swap names.
---
on Golemagg I have:
---
Defence
---
Wink
---
On Shazzrath I have: 
---
Ying
---
Pm me for any offers.
---
Everquest 1 is still up and running. They had an expansion launch in December. I've only played EQ2, though, so I couldn't tell you how good or bad the game is compared to its first iteration. EQ2 certainly went the path of retail WoW, though, that's for sure.
---
Cool, well, while you go sit in the corner and shake your first at the man and panic about what may or may not happen in the future, I'm just gonna go enjoy the game.
---
Server?
---
Also, this game is peanuts to run, memory-wise.
---
I'm in the minority of people who aren't concerned about layering. I'm just happy to play vanilla WoW again. I don't normally PVP at all, so any amount of world PVP will be more than I've ever experienced in WoW previously.
---
Polaroids though
---
I got "Dawn" which will be my main character, a paladin. I too find some of the one word names kinda shit from an rp perspective but I'm very happy with mine.
---
Baker's dozens!
---
Lot sense of guilds have late night raids.
---
Honestly I'm hoping for classic post-naxx content keeping in the spirit of classic. Follow a totally different path than retail. Even on the world map in classic there are unused land masses and a ton of concepts that never made it to the original release. That's what I'm hoping for. I think the servers would die 1-2 years after Naxx with nothing new
---
I’m super excited because I typically powerlevel toons through expansions within a few hours. 110-120 just takes a solid weekend, I cleared WoD in 25hrs, etc.
---
I took off Tues-Friday for the launch, and I’m HOPING to hit 40 as a solo rogue (RIP - no friends). 
---
I’m excited to mindlessly farm Basilisks in the Shimmering Flats again, to explore Shadowfang Keep as if it’s the first time again, to explore as a class I’ve quite literally never played (Rogue).
---
I think many of us from the old times will stick around, but I also think that’s in part gated by guild architecture. There’s going to be a bunch of hardcore raiders railing for world first with weekday raid requirements, and many of us just don’t have that time anymore.
---
But we’ll see! Not knowing is half the excitement.
---
Yeah it's like the last lap before endgame, at 50 you start moving into the endgame zones and dungeons, Burning steppes, BRD and the plaguelands for instance. Something that seems weird compared to retail where 'endgame' is *exclusively* max level, everything before is just for getting there
---
You should edit it out so your post doesnt get removed.
---
didn't think so
---
its not xD
---
landline phone
---
I totally agree. Classic takes longer, but it's more linear.
---
Fact is, people complained enough that it's turned into what it is now. There were always people complaining about how something took too long to do, there wasn't enough to do, etc.
---
And now we have a dozen short things to do that provide progression results. The players got what they wanted. Hopefully classic will be the start of something new. A study of what we ACTUALLY enjoyed.
---
LF "Celerity" or "Brando" on whitemane. I will make it worth your time! Hmu.
---
Anybody got Nyx on Shazzrah EU? Im asking for a friend who also got placed onto the wrong server
---
Are you joking? WoW's launch was a complete shitshow with tons of issues preventing people from playing and the release of Classic is going to be even bigger.
---
Somebody's salty his name was unavailable on Herod.
---
I was thinking of stuff that goes with Private since I will try to get that rank again.
---
Private Parts
---
Private Time
---
hahaha!  I've been too busy moving to worry about this stuff!  Not even worried about my name, I'll just make a better one! HAHA!
---
No he was constantly posting shit about Mexicans and black people.  I can't really remember specifics because it was about 5 years ago now that he popped back up out of nowhere.
---
Basically for getting Azerite, do enough per week and you get a nice chunk of it, and a epic mission for your table which can reward some nice stuff like more gold or AP (boring really) 
---
And then there’s the pets and mounts you can get too. I think most people literally just do the 4 heroic ones to get the weekly cap and leave it at that!
---
Lirik is going to play there last I checked
---
The great thing about Classic is that you can max a char and then roll another char that's a completely different experience. It's also nice to park your main in STV for the lvl 50 alliance rogue that's camping your lvl 30 alt.
---
It's just funny that you're so bent out of shape over a post that you perceive as a threat to a *potential* recruit.
---
your phone is excited for Classic
---
Beef is a scientific term for the meat of a cow, doesn't mean you can't "have beef" with someone.
---
But vanilla is about the journey, there is no way he has 8 level 60’s.
---
Vanilla is much more rewarding for a causal player
---
Nasty, give me some norrlands guld!
---
Cool then layering provides larger hosting capability but as layers are reduced should not cause the same impacts to the economy that server mergers resulted in.
---
Here's the vast difference.
---
Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the game right? I can go throw a ball to my buddy in the park, but there's no way I'm going to be able to emulate the intensity of watching Brady come back from being down 25 points on the biggest stage. Professional sports are much more complicated than some dude who has mastered when to hit certain keyboard keys. 
---
Literally, anyone can do what these dudes do, not everyone can even make it onto a varsity high school football team, thus making the difference in wanting to watch one vs play it.
---
For me, earning gold ingame is part of the experience. It's the same with people who buy Powerlevelling 1-60 service. 1-60 is a huge part of the game and it feels like you are skipping parts of the game.
---
🤣😂🤢🤮🇺🇸
---
flat earth?
---
Sounds like you care more than the people you're complaining about.
---
Yeah, which was also good and made sense. Both are pretty logical systems (both in gameplay and lore) to be honest. BC was "this group is interested in seeing this place cleared" and Wrath was "I'm clearing this place out on behalf of this group". I can't remember if Wrath dungeons default to specific groups or not. Either way, I think I liked the tabard system better due to being able to choose my faction and have variety in dungeons.
---
This should really have white glowing eyes from the helmet, otherwise great work!
---
Sounds like it would make progression prior to max level pretty meaningless.
---
That’s cool then, I’m more trying to address all the people showing off their rare names and people who want to pay $50 for ‘neck’ or stuff like that.
---
Oh god, it's been too long since I last watched a ROFLbear video.
---
Herod is going to be a dumpster fire for at least a week. At least I know what to expect now, after last night's debacle.
---
I'd still rather wait an hour in queue than play with Asmongoloid or the huehueshues.
---
Can I ask, without you all shitting on me, what kind of names did you need to reserve? I get that some streamers want their names but all of you average players, what name was so good you had to reserve it?
---
frankly, Im not sure how the violence of said video game helps you in expressing yourself, but English does benefit from having a vocabulary full of words borrowed from other languages.
---
Yeah US east players got hosed, Herod got huge because folks wanted to avoid both streamers and non English speakers
---
On Herod we know that unrational isn't even a word so you made the right choice.

---
I'm asking myself the same questions honestly..
---
Nobody gonna yell at you for taking time off to play classic around here lol
---
45-55 imo.
---
A priceless experience
---
I'll quit for sure if they go with the same expansion pack route again. Don't know how long it would take to get bored without anything new added but I know it's longer than if they bring out TBC and so on.
---
Do you really think the queues will be that bad after the first day of release though? I feel like playing on the most populated server is a better option than some possible semi dead one
---
So tired of you virtue signaling sycophants. Nobody got in legal trouble. All video games are a waste of time and money. Private servers were fun. Get over yourself.
---
yep connection problems in 2004. That's why the game died. RIP WoW oh what could have been
---
I care
---
Edited now.
---
The private server scene has sustained itself for like a decade with just fresh starts. The best part of vanilla is the first 12 months. It kinda turns to shit after Naxx comes out.
---
Enjoy it mate 😀 that’s a good plan!
---
Oh I remember that. But even afterwards his content was good. It's not that it's bad NOW so much as the negativity gets draining to watch. I mean I get it. Layering sucks. And not having enough servers is dumb. And all the other stuff, he's right on. But it's about delivery more than anything for me
---
Not that creative, but very Solid.
---
Ok so we're up to 5%
---
I suck Balls ALL DAY just because I like it so much
---
Push to talk is going to be mandatory if I end up in any form of leadership role again. 
---
**No one wants to hear your cheech coughing, coke sniffling, beer burping, fan whirring, tv blabbing, or children crying.**

should probably learn how it functions before you throw around your whiny layering argument
---
[Yes](https://www.twitchmetrics.net/c/20694610-towelliee)
---
I mean a friend of mine reserved a character name BigGae so idk
---
No joke, no sarcasm, my favorite part of this is how far I had to scroll down to see the name because the picture was so large. What a REVEAL!
---
Whoa there OP, people care about what names they got, just not people worth paying attention to.
---
I hope that's the case. Im currently leaning that way as I don't expect the spanish+portuguese group to be as large as people expect.  I think id rather deal with some spanish+portuguese in chat and actually be in the game verse sitting in a login queue.
---
Survival specialized hunters are not guaranteed to survive.
---
I will check it out when I get home. Thanks!
---
I'm good with it.
---
All the people saying "X or Y spec is bad" are referring to people pushing progression or otherwise are "hardcore".
---
You'll be fine, Druids are very good, and Brez is extremely valuable to have. You just need to learn your timing with the different ranks
---
Really, in the end ping between EST (Chicago) vs PST (LA) really isn't going to be that big of a difference?  At least it's not like when we were playing with 100+ on private servers.
---
h
---
The people that intend on tanking in vanillia havent actually either tried to do it in the stress tests or even looked up what they are getting themselves into. Most of these people will drop off and reroll the dedicated few will keep trying and actually learn and get raid spots. Tank in classic is a different beast and its gonna be interesting to see how badly it turns out for some groups.
---
 Threat alone Is gonna be interesting dps in retail are so use to being able to start right after the tank pulls u literally can not do that in classic buffs like fort and blessings have a decent amount of aggro. And warrior tanks generally use demo and battle shout to start a group pull so they have aggro. 
---
What I'm saying is give it a be one of those few u can learn it if u have the will just look it up practice and dont quit until YOU feel like your not doing a well enough job. And take advice from your groups a dont be afraid to tell them to quit doing stupid shit or to whisper the healer and ask them to stop healing said individuals. 
---
Be you and enjoy the game and I hope to see u in it.
---
It's just a question.
---
Nice, Shh is awesome!
---
The discord server for Harold has a 179/109 ratio of horde vs alliance right now.
---
You're thinking of Faerlina.
---
Glad someone knew where that originated.
---
[deleted]
---
Right? Some days I might be down for a 6 hour grind, others I might not want to touch the rep for weeks. 
---
I get to make that decision, not some timegating forcing me to do it on a daily basis.
---
Good way for me to not invite you to a group
---
Why tf is a gnome Dwalin was a Dwarf 😭
---
The thing is, you can go a druid and have Tank or Healing specs.
---
Tank classes are still lower and you're always needed for 5 man dungeons.  For raids, it's a little bit different but you might be asked to raid as a healer and then you can 5 man or 20 man as a Bear and tank.
---
Ah yes, I'm definitely a Blizzard shill for suggesting someone not play Blizzard games if they don't like Blizzard. That certainly sounds like something a shill would do.
---
EverQuest is a great example of where I’d *like* them to go with the project. EQ Live now starts a new progression server off with various rule sets.
---
So maybe an “Arthas” server +XP gains progression ending at Lich King.
---
Six months later we get “Blade’s Edge” normal XP gains characters start at 58 progression ends at TBC.
---
Then, hey everybody nostalgia time, 1-60 DM/AQ/ZG/all dungeons open let’s slog to Naxx one... more... time.
---
After resubscribing for the first time since early Cataclysm to reserve some names I decided to download retail to dick around for two weeks to kill time but it all just seemed so foreign.  I had seen some stories about it here on this sub but it was weird actually seeing it, made me feel like old Brooks.  Decides to just uninstall and will see everyone in the game I remember in a few weeks.
---
They should try and make new content for Classic. If that doesn't work they can go towards BC. Once they go towards BC the path for more classic content is forever closed.
---
Sounds like one of the auto generated names
---
&gt; Levelling is THE game in vanilla.
---
Nah. Leveling's the shit you gotta slog through to get to the fun parts.
---
streamers vs streamers will be here till the last day of servers, name reservations will be forgotten about and not posted again, unless they open more servers,

Because your "opinion" isn't even remotely based on facts.

Agreed.  It might have been fun to play with people whose videos I watch (MadSeason and Skarm come to mind), I basically just wanted to avoid Soda/Asmon's cancerous following

Dread it. Run from it. `Döt` still arrives.
---
You can send multiple attachments, each costs 30c
---
I appreciate the offer! Alas, I’m Horde/Grobbulus.
---
It’s good to see the community in the reddit comments is similar to the community I recall from BC/super late vanilla.
---
The benches in Deeprun Tram are benches, not chairs, so I didn't have to worry about that.
---
if you cannot figure out how to invite someone to a group you are retarded.
---
If you wanted dual gathering you'd probably go skinning in place of one or the other.
---
That destroys the purpose of having a unique name.
---
Can you post a higher res picture of the quartz with gold?
---
Go with a Druid if you’re more of a solo player. You can always tank 5 mans in your way to 60 and then go Resto. 
---
Warriors can be a pain to lvl, especially solo and as your first character. I’d give Druid a shot, and then if you decide to roll warrior, you at least have some funds for it.
---
Also highly interested! 26 year old returning player with a big group on Fairbanks with the exact same interests and expectations.
---
That was always something that blew my mind
---
name?
---
Exactly, you still have to go through the Raids before jumping into the current one. Old raids are still used throughout the expansion as opposed to BFA where Uldir and BoD are abandoned completely. It is sad in a way because Blizzard still puts out fantastic raids and it is what has kept me around, but their audience only get to see it for a few months before it is pointless.
---
Ghostbusters
---
Yep, I was a super Final Fantasy fanboy, up until 8, where the monsters leveled with you.  I put that shit down.
---
Dang, is this on Herod? I was wondering who snagged it first. I like to think I was close, but probably not

# [A] [EU] &lt;Epoch&gt; | Wed/Sun/Mon 19/20 - 23 CET | Progressive PvE | Recruiting |
---
**Introduction:**
---
The classic Alliance guild &lt;Epoch&gt; is a progressive PvE raiding guild. With classic coming closer and closer, we are trying to further expand our already existing raid cadre, to start progressing through Phase 1 as soon as possible. If you are looking for a friendly and relaxing environment, while also staying competitive in terms of endgame PvE progression, this guild is definitely for you. Check out our [website](https://epoch.wowalliances.com/pages/info) for more detailed information!
---
**Raid times:**
---
Estimated start of raid progression: Within the first 6 weeks.
---
* Wednesday 20:00 – 23:00 CET
---
* Sunday 19:00 – 23:00 CET
---
* Monday 20:00 – 23:00 CET
---
**Requirements:**
---
* Social and mature behavior in guild chat, aswell as in a raiding environment. That includes being able to communicate in English!
---
* Being interested in honing your skills (for instance: class spec compositions with other guild mates) and being open to criticism.
---
* A minimum of 75% attendance to our guild intern events and raids, to be considered for the raider rank.
---
**What we can offer:**
---
* Transparent Leadership with PvE/PvP experience throughout multiple legacy projects on recent popular servers.
---
* EPGP as our fair loot distribution method, with slight adjustments.
---
* Experienced officers and guild mates that are always willing to help out.
---
* Guild Discord (info about raid encounters, news and much more)
---
* Website with mobile accessibility for raid signups and news.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are currently open to all classes and specs for our main raid roster.
---
If you are interested, join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/V77Q73Q) to contact any of the officers or alternatively apply on our [website](https://epoch.wowalliances.com/pages/info). Additionally we are also looking for Class-leaders and a Heal-lead.
---
If you have further questions feel free to ask them on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/V77Q73Q)!
---
Gnome is the worst race
---
that was before streamer announcements were made, should be interesting what a new poll shows now that people have decided where theyre finally going
---
ITT: People that don't understand time zones
---
It's anecdotal information but about half the people I know who are going to play are waiting till closer to launch to resub
---
Names?
---
Because they've stated that each layer can/will be the size of a Vanilla server, but obviously we'll have multiple layers per server, and there will be 150k+ *easily* even after the launch hype dies down, and with only only 11 NA servers, you're looking at over 12-15k+ on every server.
---
Unless Blizzard decides to open new servers, of course.  If they want to keep it to a "Real Vanilla Feel", they'll have to offer migrations off some servers.  Herod alone I waited in a 15k a just to make my characters, it's going to be a madhouse on launch, way more than old servers ever had.
---
Yeah I'm torn between the two as well. Got a name reserved on both.
---
I'd rather whitemane, I usually end up on a W realm somehow. But hearing that 4chan is making it their home is my only worry.  But honestly that probably just means ignoring some people in general chat.
---
I should look at guilds that are recruiting on both maybe.  Decisions decisions
---
I'm basing it on the stickied survey results. Take that for what it's worth.
---
Do elemental shaman have a non pvp place in classic? Or are they memes like survival hunters?
---
My friend rolled Grob Horde so I may end up having a lone toon there to mess around with.
---
I’m pretty sure he will be playing wow. His name was on someone’s streamer list yesterday.
---
Worm?
---
Eh, it's fun and it's content and it helps pass the time while we all wait for release. There's not much to get excited about now for these last 2 weeks, so let people enjoy their names bro.
---
annnnnnnnnnd thats the day classic dies.
---
Welcome to classic wow.
---
But usually you arent as good as them just like football
---
Is there some kind of ingame keyboard or would you have to look up the codes/use the windows onscreen thing?
---
lf names on Shazzrah, can be 3, 4 or 5 letters as long as they're cool!
---
pm me, we can make a deal :)
---
How exactly is that name "funny"?
---
Metrics from Latinamerican and Brazilian posts, I can link when I get home
---
I just flat out don't agree with catch-up mechanics. A good MMO should just retain an incentive to keep guilds raiding old content
---
jesus, Jesus.
---
#**C IS EVERYTHING**
---
Might do beds next, we'll see
---
My friend got orgasm back in the day. He got to keep it for a few months
---
I lost my name because i got hit by queue pretty hard and then got it because they fucked up and people got logged on the wrong server lol
---
i don't see any realm being dead with so few of them.
---
After hearing about the folks who unknowingly made their characters on the wrong server I had to go back and check I did mine right.
---
There's no point in listing both capital and lowercase versions.
---
"A" tier murloc name
---
Shh don't tell them
---
I'd say the same for all the snowflake posts like this
---
I actually like wrath and cata lvling areas. TBC I just dislike for some reason. Even first char to 70 when BC was live it felt sooo long. MoP and everything past it is pretty shit
---
Join the megathread:
---
"I chose a name"
---
Yeah I'd like this the best too.
---
(Hello again SmokeCocks 8) small world :P)
---
Use Questie and EZquest as apposed to AAP. AAP is not functioning correctly
---
RIP Nostrils.
---
For the turn in or the whole quest guide
---
I have a different take, part of the reason I enjoy this one is Edwin Vancleef was a GREAT villain. He isn't some all powerful knight from a prominent noble bloodline, he was just an everyday stonemason. He was a loyal member of the alliance before Stormwind wronged his men. He and the stonemasons rebuilt stormwind, but then stormwind refused to pay them. Due to Edwins importance he was offered an important government position for the work he had done if he would be silent, but he was not okay with his employees going unpaid for their work, so he turned it down. They rioted, and were expelled from Stormwind. Edwin rallied them and formed the Defias gang.
---
I'd wager that Edwin Vancleef is one of the best villains in the game.

Ok thanks!

Why repost so fast
---
You can’t stand them, so you dedicated an enormous part of your Classic WoW existence to interacting with them. What a pointless waste of your own time and resources.
---
I plan on being 60 in 2 weeks. 
---
Back in vanilla it took me 10 days playtime usally to hit 60. But this time inhave a laptop at work so easy leveling
---
Never heard of any of those people, but thanks for sharing your thoughts today with us.
---
The viva la bam shirt and the skateboard, oof. I felt that.
---
Yeah, but they will need to remove layering at some point.
---
I forgot my post would be graded. I will do better.
---
shoulders out, let's go
---
My guild was still using vent a year or two ago until blizzard put in the in-game voice chat.
---
We have a cranky old pally that refuses to download anything but Vent for some reason.
---
&gt;Warlords of Draenor could introduce a proper housing system, like in FF XIV
---
As someone who actively plays FFXIV you have no clue what your talking about there.
---
Scaling is for snakes and people with dry skin - not wow!
---
They can expect to get banned then. Collusion is a bannable offense.
---
I am in same boat.  I want to avoid the "High" population/popular server and avoid streamer server.  Which leaves me Thalnos (EST), but prefer to avoid language issues (I know it's mostly English). 
---
So Herod it is I guess.
---
Got GankSinatra on my rogue 👌

Buffs the raid damage of 3 of the most underperforming specs, 0 impact in pvp and solo balance. Too bad most people on this forum are not able to think critically and just fall back on "omg you'll break pvp." I'm really hoping that Blizz revisits their no-changes stance down the line with minor tweaks like this, but we'll see.
---
There really are a bunch of class and talent fixes that would be amazing. Make roots, travel form, and ghost wolf work indoors, there's no reason for a class's kit to get shut down because of location. Gives more of a mobility identity to shaman and druid, gives druids more group utility. We had roots in ZF and it was awesome. Merge axe spec and polearm spec into poleaxe spec. Go back to the old pally prot tree that had HS at 21 point talents so paladins can actually start instance tanking earlier. Basically just iterate under the exact same vein they were 1.1-1.12.
---
Would be happy with a megathread. Too bad the mods are on vacation.

"I keep up nightfall so the warriors don't have to"
---
blocked. blocked. blocked. youre all blocked.  
---
none of you are free of sin.
---
How ignorant can you be to say something like this
---
The current numbers are not indicative of reality.  I saved 15 names yesterday across my five accounts.  All of them were made without any customization.
---
The funny thing is that people care more about changing the name than either the religious institutions or that attitude toward and interactions with them.
---
Derived from the word "Necrosis" and a pretty amazing gaming moment!
---
There rolling alliance.
---
Roll Horde you little liberal and find out what guild they are in. Camp then.
---
You run away like a coward from a fight to join a bunch of hive minded people on herod?
---
Have fun sir. I'm mess up some incels
---
After phase 1 it gets removed so we good.
---
U shared, I shared, it’s kinda the purpose of this place...
---
Social gathering? Like at Xroads?
---
I know, good thing they don't buff frost or arcane damage either. That would totally mess up warlock lore /s
---
Literally none of that disproves what I said.
---
Your pov
---
Still there might be upsides to some people, even those who arent part of the fanbase. Streamers could influence events and start big raids easier than on servers without them. And if streamer is on a zone  you can just ignore chat and dodge if they come close.
---
blizz removed collusion from their tos, there will be collusion 100%
---
Hit up Youk if you want a group of weird ass guildies :)
---
Buttstallion, It wasn't taken on retail surprisingly
---
As I read FB WoW groups, apparently the brunt of BR/LA ppl are going to play in Faerlina with a bunch of community pages and streamers
---
* 20 EUR for a brown linen bag
---
* 40 EUR for a level 2 boost
---
* 60 EUR for lesser magic wand boost
---
* 80 EUR for a postcard from Bobby Kottick
---
* 100 EUR for a postcard to Asmongold (bestseller)
---
Skyrim, d'oh!
---
By fire, be purged!
---
Noob. I got rid of my virginity to purify the mind and enable full focus on wow. There is no life now as I have completed the challenges of irl, my body now becomes a vessel to drive my real self in azeroth.
---
Same. If I am going to even wear a graphic tee to begin with it has to be a bit more creative while also being understated.
---
I know what must be done. FUS RO DAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Gave me an interesting thought... any word or sound *could* be a name if you respond to it right? So I guess they are all real fake real names??
---
Epic convo bro!!!!!
---
GET ME OUTTA HERE MEISTA
---
Stop with this nostalgia, please.   
---
What do you mean it takes away choice? You didn't really had to do any dailies stuff unless you wanted to minmax and tryhard the game or get some vanity items.   
---
What is the difference betwen classic tryharding aka farming non stop resources for gold and pots or 24/7 spamming battlegrounds that you don't even enjoy anymore just to get r13 items?   
---
Also there is no mental activation in classic. Just because you can die from mob when questing doesn't mean it is by any means challenging, just adds downtime.   
---
Let me tell you the optimal rotations for some classes in classic:   
---
mage: frostbolt spam, later 5x scorch into fireball spam, no procs, nothing.   
---
hunter: auto attack + aimed shot and multishot off cooldown   
---
rogue: keep slide and dice up, sinister strike spam into evi finisher   
---
warlock: curse + shadowbalt spam.   
---
Leveling past level 30 in retail offer you more variety compared to classic endgame in terms of spell usage.   
---
Like, I really don't mind people liking classic, but at least give relevant reasons like community, enjoying old content, enjoying no transmog, enjoying the mindless grind or whatever. But don't ever put complexity next to a classic in one sentence.
---
Oh no what’d you do
---
If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 0hrs 0min... you're gonna see some serious shit!
---
What on earth is a cornhole board?  Do you stick your dick in it?
---
I preordered the remake of WC:3 after they announced it because i thought it was going to be released that December. Nope.. I preordered a game a year in advanced. I was so tilted. Im waiting for that release to play through WC3 for the first time.
---
What if you aren’t the party leader, but need to relay their name to the party leader?
---
Blizzard didn't want to make classic.
---
Yes. It isn't necessarily the population level at launch, but I think it is a fairly good indicator.
---
I prefer the snipping tool myself.
---
remember that meista meista lady? Yah I think I just killed her
---
Yeah but then you’re on a pve server so who gives a fuck. 
---
Y’all are furniture at best.
---
That 4chan is rolling on Whitemane.
---
All while being level 2. 
---
Dudes a legend.
---
For clarification op did say 6-8 hours per play period, not necessarily per day. This makes it fairly straight forward tbh, assuming some competence and not too much dead time spent instancing or mucking about, hitting 60 in 11sh days /played should be a safe assumption. 11*24/7=~37.7. So there ya go, it would take OP somewhere in the ballpark of 37 play sessions to hit 60.
---
I saw his stream for the first time yesterday, Idk how someone so small and skinny and fragile act like such a dick.. like he legit looks like a damn dork and he acts hard.
---
even tsm akaadian gonna play here :p
---
Wish they would have class coffee mugs!
---
You're a moron, and OP already stated he's probably not raiding because he's not a moron like you and is filled with retarded expectations about classic.
---
Whiske works as well... i had the same issue.
---
There should be a Spanish realm in both NA and EU tbh, at least one.
---
As long as we get less gear bloat, don't make existing content irrelevant, and no flying.
---
You may be unhappy with it, but as another active FF XIV player I think its housing system is the best out there. Not the best it could be, but better than most. In fact, the only gripe I have with FF XIV is the loading screens at every map border.
---
Only reference I saw was when they brought on Latin and Spanish realms that is when they introduced it.  It was still early on in the game's life.  The majority of it not being allowed was on RP realms which required RPers to report them on the RP realm.
---
Why!?
---
WHY!?
---
I was just saying this the other day. He's not even a villain really. The Stormwind nobility screwed him and his men over royally. I don't know the whole story (or even if there is one), but with Anduin being a kid and not knowing what the hell is going on 90% of the time most likely, I bet the administrators there thought they could pull a fast one on Edwin and his men and abuse their power / use the stormwind army to bully him into submission. 
---
If this was a single player RPG, you would have been able to talk to Edwin and get the whole story, then uncover who screwed him over and why, then deal with the corrupt administration and get justice for Edwin and his men. Alas, this is an MMO, so not much choice available. 
---
Similar thing happened in SWTOR in the base game. Darth Malgus revolts against the emperor (and rightly so, the guy literally consumes worlds to feed his immortality / force power), and the players aren't given a choice - we just have to put him down. Feelsbad.
---
The spike of the axe is too close the screen, it's making me nervous.
---
Lol at all the downvotes
---
Smooth brain redditors so predictable
---
Most of pandaria was pretty well designed actually! wish they had done more with the jade forest!
---
Lol I remember running Deadmines for the first time with my group of friends from church. I remember trying to loot Mr. Smith's treasure chest and accidently aggroing him instead causing an impromptu boss fight lol. Good times.
---
True but unsure how dedicated my friend is hes pretty casual
---
I don't know who the majority of these people are.
---
It's not an insult. I know a kid with Asperger's. Incredibly smart for his age. 4.0 in school.
---
I play as cy, and i like it.
---
The hero we need.
---
He is doing this for free. Stop telling him to work more etc. when he is spending his free time on his you are not his boss. I think they are doing a good job
---
I'm still astounded that classic can draw so many viewer since this game is quite boring to watch... tho i enjoyed to pvp tourney...
---
Hey, weird isn’t always bad! I, Taserface will be online likely the first 24hr run, then on/off through Labor Day.
---
Don’t worry about the name (nickname), I’ll have a developed RP story by launch.
---
I’ll likely hit you up a day or two in as things go! Day 1 is all about getting ahead of the pack.
---
All these layers, are ours
---
&gt; Consumable usage in Classic is a lot higher than retail. What's more, there are just a lot more consumables to use. It's not just a flask. It's a flask, and some elixirs, and potions every pull, and food, and more. For 40 people.
---
This is true for the min max mentality that we see a lot on private servers, but you can clear Ony-MC-BWL without using any consumables as long as you do the mechanics efficiently.
---
I'd rather them work around Classic, after all the phases are over to use the Hyjal space, reintroduce Karazhan as a level 60 instance (use Atiesh), the Stormwind instance, etc.
---
&gt; new realms and character transfers   
---
&gt; \[wouldn't be desirable\]
---
Don't know what you're talking about. More servers to spread population would be a good thing, 'Cause means that Classic is growing. And in Vanilla they added servers as well. And transferring worked just fine if you've got a working brain that knows when it is wise to transfer.
---
Question: Is herod strictly for East coasters or will the bulk of raiding guilds be located there as well?
---
I'm on the west coast and the difference in having 20-80 ping isn't noticable in WoW really, so I don't mind playing on a further server but I'm curious... are realms like Whitemane going to be dead on arrival?
---
He probably meant paid transfers. Which I have no doubt will come, but no idea when they'll add it.
---
Ah yes , eu pvp realms will be a melting pot of racism
---
Damnit we're gonna be inundated with warlocks this time around.
---
\[The Black Stalk\]
---
14 for me
---
guy made a post asking about names. a handful of people said they would pick his name. there was nothing going on in this sub at the time, so they tried super hard to make it a meme spammed it nonstop for a couple days
---
Everyone's always talking shit about ret paladins until they need a nightfall wielder and no warrior wants to sacrifice their dps for the good of the raid.
---
Keep up that attitude and we will bring back the poorly photoshopped dogs in Warcraft scenery.
---
6/7 with rice.
---
BIG TRUE
---
Every spec can find raid spots, some are slightly harder to "sell" to raid group but Resto druid isn't even bad. The only time your spec will ever truly prohibit you from joining a group is if you're a Ret Paladin trying to join the world 1st speedrun group or something, and even then who knows lmao
---
NSFW

I really wanted to reserve No as a name but failed

Joana’s speed leveling best time was 4 days 20 hours and 49 minutes of /played.

He has an online guide and some videos if you’re interested.  https://www.furiouspaul.com/wow/

Ashenvale too
---
That was a good one haha
---
U even browse before u post? Low effort repost
---
Fuckkkkk I thought they were all going Herold
---
My buddy couldn't get his on some bs. I'd love to surprise him though so if you've got Sauce on Whitemane lmk and we can make a deal!
---
From: dude who is so attached to "Lev" he adds an underscore *and* a hyphen to claim it 🤔
---
This sounds like your own opinion worded to sound like fact. Unless you are suggesting all religious institutions support child abuse?  
---
I’m just pointing out how little thought went into the name. Would you tell a rape victim a rape joke? Would you tell a recent widow a joke about a dead spouse? Would this guy walk into a room of “normal” people and yell, “Hey everyone, I play a priest in a video game and this is his name!” 
---
Of course he won’t. It’s only not a big deal to him because he can remain anonymous and do it. If it’s really not something that’s a huge deal, I would be interested for him to tell his coworkers, parents, or those he respects that he thinks the name is funny and he gets a kick out of making people uncomfortable with it.
---
And thats why im so excited for classic.  Ive always been an altoholic largely because i *love* leveling.  I love seeing the zones, gathering stuff for quests, keeping up on professions, etc.  I want that part of the game to be a major reason i play it again.
---
Leveling feels *so* hollow on retail now.  Ive actually had some luck the last few months with forcing myself to slow down, read every quest, turn off quest tracking, use no assists (BoAs, gold from other toons, etc).
---
I was definitely having fun with it, but it still just doesnt quite feel the same :/
---
I think i was at 4.5 days played at 80ish, but i just kind of lost interest at 82 or 83.  Maybe its the Cata zones.
---
blizzard has the population numbers, they know how many MORE players played TBC than played Classic
---
why on earth would they change anything about TBC?
---
they wrote the book on multi-expansion success...I expect them to follow that book to the letter
---
Looking for Wawa NA Herod, Classic NA Herod
---
Competitive people, and m+ is tailored towards these people.
---
He would just laugh lol
---
The graphics should not be a problem. They can just make lower-poly models and lower resolution textures. This shouldn't be an issue for any professional in that field.
---
&gt; I don't know how good they would be to recreate the same type of content.
---
It probably would fail but I think it's still worth to give it a shot. Because once BC is out all doors for new content for both BC and Classic will be closed as Blizzard cannot make new content for both.
---
Handle it!
---
Personally, how I look on the DPS meter matters more than how my face looks.  I’d advocate Human all day as the DPS gain is pretty noticeable...
---
Brotha Stubbs? Is that you Brotha stubbs?
---
No! You are the epic one!
---
I'm assuming you haven't been on this sub much this week? Layering isn't working as intended.. at all. It is literally just sharding right now, with phasing between different layers walking through city / zone boundaries etc. 
---
There was a thread about a big pvp fight at the end of the beta, and almost all the comments were about how they had to beg for invites to get onto the pvp layer, and how entire raid groups were getting phased off in the middle of pvp.
---
Hahahahaha, stay mad.
---
\*Tears up\* Beautiful, just beautiful.  /Clap
---
&gt;Over the Thanksgiving weekend (nov 25), players continued to buy World of Warcraft in record numbers, with a total of over 350,000(a) copies of the game selling through
---
pls inv to redridge pvp layer pls
---
I can confirm this as well
---
PTT or GTFO
---
It's a meme
---
Best bet is to try and find a source where someone tested it in the beta. Grenades are a bit ambiguous on their effect.
---
The base spell mechanic is a stun but the stun effect is set as a knockout?
---
https://imgur.com/a/xApysDd
---
Those guilds aren’t going to be big enough relative to the population to do that easily.
---
Not to mention they aren’t getting free handouts from the GMs on Classic, like they were on Pservers.
---
Indeed. 8 is one of my least favorites because of this.
---
That's actually a good name! Gratz!
---
The problem with brand merchandise is that it’s always crap quality...  Those are $1 shirts from Vietnam sold for $15 just because it has a logo.
---
This is where I’m at too with all of my work. Doesn’t bother me one bit :)

Tried for Merlin on my gnome. Got Merlino instead. Seems more gnomey

Because before he was a big streamers Staysafe used to drop N bombs all the time in discord chat...

Alexensual is a racist too, but he is definitely right about Staysafe lol.
---
Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
---
But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
---
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.

you mock but we did this for nost and we'll be doing it again. also pizzas.

so you were mentioning elsewhere your plans to roll on RPPVP while not planning on RPing, and some RPer spanked you for it, so you came here for the vague callout
---
kewl

Ay!

At first I was disappointed I couldn't get into Herod, and when I did all of the names I wanted were taken. Got my name on Grobbulus out of pure luck.
---
Cya in game :)
---
True, all the real NEET losers who dedicate their life to this game  do happen to be European
---
Then do it. This sub has been crying about the most superfluous shit. No wonder the sub has barely grown recently, people get scared away by this shit.
---
It should say like 700 hours for Herod players.
---
That was such a good episode
---
I was running the game at max settings + 200% 3D Rendering

make friends
---
The housing is fine its the getting a plot. If you think thats fine idk what drugs you are on but give me some.
---
Rolling alliance rogue here , never played vanilla and not currently playing retail . Excited anyway
---
Agreed.
---
24 hour 1-60 never happened in vanilla, sorry lol
---
It’s not
---
Well you clearly have a different point of view on retail. And this may come as a surprise but there are a lot of people on this sub that disagree with you. I didn't say that pve rotations are hard or difficult. I mentioned health and mana mattering as a good thing, making you have to think about what you are doing and spells you are casting.
---
"Rawr classic is easy nobody should ever say it has any level of depth or complexity." I've heard it before by the retail fan boys.
---
The point is that classic is much more enjoyable for a myriad of reasons not even brought up in this post, that's just two I listed. Dailies don't feel fun or rewarding and unlimited mana takes any decision making out if the game, outside of the top 100 guilds raiding mythic end game.
---
Why is the retail fan base so threatened by the success of classic? Every single one goes out of their way to point out that it's just rose colored glasses and it won't last blah blah blah.
---
It was BIS for a long time, it was a cloth pink chest, that gave 2% crit, I think it was BIS until after AQ40.
---
No it hasnt. It's just a joke that millenials are maturing, and evolved into boomers
---
Yeah the pop will drop because of the toxic private server guilds LOL
---
LF Bob on fairbanks
---
No. Changes.
---
Maybe. Don't care. It's not me who wants the invite.
---
Still not valid. Stop making shit up.
---
I was in a pretty serious business guild for vanilla that only took Holy Paladins into progression raids. I ended up switching to a Warlock main for TBC since if I wanted to be locked into the healer role I would've rolled a Priest.
---
I agree, this is a low(effort) blow.
---
Yes, for a first timer with a questing addon 2-3 months is a reasonable expectation to hit 60.
---
Tmugsy and his TBI is right up there
---
Im saving those 2 weeks of sub and hope that my names arent taken in 2 weeks
---
I don't like his content. I don't like how he throws around his streamer privilege. I don't think he's done anything to positively effect the world of warcraft playing audience since early Cataclysm.  
---
I'm probably petty and shallow because my reasons for not liking him aren't because he's shown some kind of evil in the past or scandal. I just don't like him.
---
Just go PVE and be a man with your flag on 100% of the time
---
Yes it's a joke about millennials getting old and maturing
---
Once again you aren’t raiding, so I wouldn’t really worry about what people think. You can totally beat people in 1v1’s PvPing and dungeons people are just looking for 5.
---
If you want heavy armor and rare, Ret Paladin is the only real choice.
---
It literally happened to my friends account who got hacked...

When he got it back somehow they made a bunch of Blizzard variation named alts to try and scam people

Some people here don't get sarcasm
---
You should see Stormscale EU. One person writes in swedish and for the next 2-3 hours the public channels are gonna be in swedish. I imagine it's worse on servers like Outland but goddamn, I hate my fellow svenskar
---
I'm in the same boat. I don't RP much at all, but it *does* liven up the world a bit. Just don't ruin people's roleplay by being off topic in the normal chat speak channels. But beyond that, it's just the same as any regular PVP server. Zone channels, general chat, etc is just.. The normal shithousery. As for PVP, regular PVP rules apply. Red is dead, ganking, etc, is all fair game.
---
I'm half expecting some shrazz/golemagg players to move to zandalar if the queues are real bad in the first week. Hell, whilst I enjoy the change of pace that RP provides, the main reason I'm rolling ZT, is because the PVP servers will be so overcrowded that it might ruin the experience.
---
No, I mean I remember well the system you’re describing, but I’m pretty certain that was Cata already (or maybe was it launched during Cata prepatch when it was still WotLK ?). I farmed Kirin Tor, Sons of Hodir, Argent crusade, Oracles rep by doing dailies during LK ( in the case of Kirin Tor, killing mobs in the Violet Hold dungeon directly gave rep iirc), and I remember there was no option to get a tabard to make it faster at the time. 
---
In fact I was very pissed when these tabards were introduced because I had just finished farming the sons of Hodir rep days before Cata’s launch to buy the mammoth, and realized soon after that I could have just waited for Cata and bought myself a tabard and farmed heroics to do everything way faster.
---
True!! Originally I took the name because of a funny bit my buddy and I came up with, but the game we were playing already had Stubs, thus Stubbs became my thing! It’s always strange to see that name in public too, like the Stubbs bbq sauce always makes me do a double take
---
Pretty cheap from where I'm from! Only a few silver ○.●
---
they all are LGBT friendly
---
if somebody harasses somebody else based on their orientation
---
well, that person gets reported and banned
---
I think the first idea you have is the most genuine, the question imo would be technical resources. 
---
I'm not an expert on this matter, but would the technical resources of saving characters, copying characters and possible migration of characters while maintaing 1, 2, 3 different servers at the same time be worth the cost?
---
I want to say its worth whatever the player wants it to be worth, but will enough people stay to play on those Vanilla / BC dedicated servers after all the time passes? or will Blizzard be doing server uptime and maintenance just to please 100-1000 players total?
---
Horde naturally just has a combative ethos. Rolling a big punk rock orc to smash gnomes/elves or a goth ud to gank things.   
---
If you're the type of person that doesn't like PvP or confrontation, you'll probably prefer alliance. And alliance is OP as shit in vanilla PvE.

Just so you know, WoW gold used to sell for £25.00 for 100, so its probably worth doing some homework before piping up
---
That's fair. I'm PST myself, but I only noticed about a 20ms difference when logging into the EST servers fwiw. It's pretty minor but totally understand why you'd prefer to stick on EST.
---
ret paladin
---
Not even a little bit. Once I'm full t3 and there isn't much to progress towards, I'm not going to spend hours farming pets or obscure recipies that I'll never make anyways. I'll stick around to see how BC fairs if they chose to go that route and I'd probably stay for horizontal content (even if I still think that's a bad idea) but I won't just hang out after I've done what I came to do.
---
Of course he's not the first president to be made fun of but times are different. I used to watch the show "That's my Bush!" on comedy central. Then I'd go and log onto wow and nobody is talking politics or racism in chat. People were racist before Trump, but now with him in office, those rasists are letting out their opinions publicly because it is less frowned upon.  Just like gay people. There was the same amount of gay people back in the 90s as there are now. Since gay marriage is now legal and its becoming more of a normal social way of life, people more openly express their gayness. Just like people more openly express their racism. I have nothing against anyone that's gay but I felt the analogy-to-time-line seemed accurate.
---
If you give a population a mostly arbitrary binary choice, you'll always end up with a fairly even split.
---
&gt;If that is the case, how does the average BR player know that Thalnos is where the top end PVE raid guilds of BR are playing? I think you backed yourself in a corner there bub.
---
&gt;If they don't know enough to use reddit one of the top visited sites in the Americas
---
The fuck are you on about? Brazilians have their own communities and sites. Why would they visit an English speaking site if they might not even speak English. Do you think the Brazilian community announced their chosen server here on reddit?
---
I'm happy to take my time getting my dungeon set gear. While in retail I feel like I'm behind and will never catch up because I missed weeks, months, worth of free loot chests
---
Questing was fine due to layering. 
---
Funny enough, layering was the worst thing about the stress tests and Beta, when it glitched out or acted wonky anyway. Hopefully it's further tweaked before the 27th.
---
Eh, if your group has good comms for Magmadar then you really only need a fpp for Rag and I’ve been in some guilds that have the reaction times of slugs.
---
Vael definitely needs consumables though.
---
Come to Faerlina. So far everyone I know that’s coming to this server is super chill. Plus then you’ll have the option to go to random server wide events, or completely ignore them like I probably will. 
---
Also, you won’t have to deal with as many login queues unless a streamer just started. My guess is that most of the streamers with gigantic followings will have moved on within a couple of weeks... and if not, their fan base will at least start playing the game for their own enjoyment by that point.
---
Right!! Its just dragging now :(
---
As much as I want to say yes, I think I’m gonna have to say no. Though I can be if you’d like ;)
---
In retail you don’t have to do the things you feel you have to do.  That’s what you chose to do.  On retail you could make a level one and just level and take your time.  Just food for thought - it’s the same mentality, you chose something to do.
---
Definitely not but at least I'll have more chances of having someone that understand the request if I'm not on Thalnos.
---
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?!
---
You'll have more fun with shaman - retribution you have to try so hard for such low dps - enhancement you drop totems, shock your enemies and pray for wind fury to proc.
---
Imagine your classic progress unlocking stuff in retail
---
Blizz please don't do this
---
Well, prepare to empty your wallet.
---
Or just pick something else.
---
Large scale pvp battles are what I'm looking forward to the most. Dueling tournaments seem fun too.
---
That equation only takes into account people logged in currently, not characters created.
---
I don’t know how cloud based WoW, but auto-scaling is super common place and pretty easy
---
Yes, but the thing is, post WotLK, more people were not happy than people that were indeed happy with some changes. That's a very large part of the reason WoW lost so much subs from that point on.
---
damn that was lit
---
How would I not notice that? It's a big difference. On top of that the number can fluctuate based on what's happening and if people are on my internet bogging it down. Why would I want to start at a higher minimum?
---
That's the feeling i'm getting too, and I'm joining Classic primarily for the PVP. Nothing gave me more joy than a really competitive 3v3 arena or an all out blood bath in AV.
---
I don't think he means it in a "I can't figure it out." way but a "If you're using alt characters to get a name you couldn't nab you're a dick and I won't invite you." way.
---
I recommend rolling a rogue.  Great class for PVE/PVP alike.  Rogues do great dps and are an easy class to learn but a difficult class to master.  PVP you will be pretty much second to none with the exception of warriors (overpower hurts).  However, being able to stealth helps with that, just avoid warriors and head for the cloth wearers.  The exception to that is if you happen to ever get Thunderfury on your rogue, which means you will also melt warriors in PVP (been there done that, good times).  
---
The fact that they use energy which constantly regenerates makes them a fun class that you can continue to mash buttons and string different abilities together.  
---
I think one of the great things about rogues is the amount of CC's they have, especially in vanilla/classic.  You can literally keep a player incapacitated for 10-15 seconds or more, all the while beating on them.  Anyone who played vanilla feared the dreaded stunlock rogue, especially in open world PVP where there was no escape.  
---
Rogues are not rare, but good rogues are.  Good luck.
---
you'll want to grind the rep for those dorky high elves in that dire maul library
---
throw diamonds and librams and dead abom flesh at them
---
just do it
---
Lots of fun.
---
Goon Squad is on Herod, so really you're in for the authentic Mal'Ganis-US experience, which might not be what you were hoping for.
---
Like, ok? I really couldn't care less if its still around. I just don't want dead servers.
---
Hunters and Warlocks who got the jump on you usually win every time.
---
Is it possible to have the same account name ? Not sure
---
Then they should just pick a normal name :)
---
Nice! And Cy is a real name, like Cy Young. I hadn't thought of it before but that's got to be one of the five or six which aren't total gibberish.
---
Bo
---
Cy
---
He
---
Hi
---
Oh
---
Ow
---
Maybe there's more like ten or twelve.
---
Whitemane is the official straight people server then.
---
Imagine that
---
no its literally the exact same moment in time
---
no one gets it early 
---
time zones dude
---
It's honestly kind of sad how you think any of this proves the launch didn't have a lot of problems.
---
That's the spirit! :)
---
Agree with the add-ons thing (not necessary till (much) later). I used Thottbot back in the day, to help find some quest objectives, but Classic Wowhead should be able to sort you out with that.
---
Enjoy it!! :)
---
&gt; and on the side a new one
---
Ohh yeah thats a given for me. The original classic needs to be either serviced by Blizzard or released to the public as open source.
---
&gt; but I have very low hope for anything new related to classic at all
---
I think what they could do safely is add content that was supposed to be in classic from later expansions (tweaking it for level 60). Like Kharazan, Uldum, Mt. Hyjal, Grim Batol, Gilneas and many more.
---
You underestimate the laziness of streamers. You have to understand that blizzard designed certain zones to have horde vs alliance clashing and so it's just inevitable that 2 streamers on opposite factions run into each other with their hoard of snipers.
---
The good thing is everyone is starting from scratch. Start the grind early my friend!
---
That’s cool
---
Yea that is so obviously satire that snopes had to make a satire badge this week just to deal with it
---
&gt; TBC was about flying...it's where we first flew
---
&gt; keeping players grounded for all of TBC...we have no way of knowing if that would make it feel more rewarding
---
So this is all just theoretical talk, but they could do beta test runs for a month, one with flying and one without. collect player data and asses if that is truly what made BC a core draw to the expac.
---
I know it was for me during the time of release, but later I viewed the expac differently because it was arenas and raids that made me love BC.
---
I used to main on Outland, I know the horrors of a Swedish mob. 
---
And to some degree it is going to be worse now.
---
This so called Nordic alliance has declared themselves to be some kind of authority that has already decided on some rules. Yikes.
---
... so it will have more than two genders to choose from?
---
RIP to your Cousin.
---
My Cousin got me into WoW and can’t imagine what it would be like if we couldn’t play together anymore.
---
Just wait until August 26th, aka Extremely Low Mod Week
---
Looking for "Tool" on Shazzrah! Please PM!
---
Yeah, I can't wait to go PVP the one other person that flagged themselves..where ever they may be
---
Cringe and memes
---
Apex Legends solo comes out today and No Mans Sky VR tomorrow. Hopefully these will keep my occupied.
---
So, you're saying I can spend my time sitting in the Darnassus chair making fun of the fact that the lowly standers have no where to sit?
---
Affects*
---
Im really disappointed blizzard didnt make a dedicated latin server :/
---
I wouldn't know, as long as I get at least few weeks of fun out of it with some friends I'm more than content already. Everything on top of it is just a plus.
---
not as much as you do i guess?
---
Glad to know fairbanks is the old person server. I'm stoked to get this thing going on the 26th. I got my SOAD, deftones, and outkast all queued up on my mp3 player. 
---
...Our lawn is gonna be friggin' immaculate
---
Blizzard said it would show a representative number of how many people have committed to the server by reserving names.
---
How do people not understand this?
---
Do you think 30k people are sitting at character select screen??????????
---
I'm 100% with you. I'm EST, but playing on Whitemane (PST). Raiding until midnight with pugs doesn't seem that bad until you realize it means 3am your time.
---
Nice goin. 
---
You're supposed to be a Hunter. Level 2. 
---
R'tard.
---
We will come for you. and you will do nothing. Because you can do nothing.
---
Get ready Blizzard, we're back.
---
Can anyone briefly explain the pros/cons of choosing Atiesh vs Pagle? As far as I can tell, they’re both PvE Pacific realms, but Pagle seems to have like twice as many players.
---
Pservers are unfortunately widely different on aoe farming than vanilla/classic is. It's a lot harder on classic due to melee leeway, batching and all that shite.
---
Absolutely true.  Devastated when my mains name since I started had name unavailable on Herod. Went to reserve the name on another server and a few minutes later the character was created on Herod.
---
You got it. Happy grinding :).
---
 [https://trade.vanillafriends.com/](https://trade.vanillafriends.com/)
---
Yeah I'm basically considering launch to be Sept 1. I'm not even gonna try till then.
---
Mankrik
---
Because its the supreme name.
---
I'm 25 and got back into skating and my back was wrecked the first day at the park.
---
Mmm no, it wasn’t that he didn’t need to, but he didn’t feel like the community deserved it. All the community does is shit on him. Go to the forums, go to Reddit- people stating they’re going to be stream sniping, camping him, making it their personal goal to ruin the experience as much as possible for him. People bashing him left and right. He was in the absolute right, the community acted like a bunch of spoiled brats. Why would he tell anyone where he would be going when that’s how the community treated him? Streamer or not, he’s a human being that can do what he want. He doesn’t have to abide by anything and it’s absurd that everyone thinks he has to play by their rules when all they do is shit on him.
---
I agree. Nothing against them or anything but they should have gotten their own.
---
Warcrafttavern did a decent breakdown. It doesn't factor in rested up, but a decent guestimate. 
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/
---
... I will allow it on one condition: Free Waffles and Chocolate for a launch (as we likely won’t be able to play anyway with due to the massive queue)
---
I think they're definitely going to be a lot more popular than they were in vanilla.
---
Yeah, didn't last long. Did you get one?
---
Can’t do much better than Whitemane. That is, as long as you’re into the savage destruction of the Horde by our glorious scarlet crusade.
---
Wasn't this posted the other day 
---
?
---
125 days
---
It won’t be nearly as bad as you make it out to be. I haven’t had an issue playing any wow expansions at launch. I did skip WoD (which I hear was a mess) but every other one was ez pz play time the week of launch with very little downtime or issues.
---
There may be some hiccups but you should be able to play 24/7 most of launch week.
---
WTLK was the last expansion whose Dungeons I really enjoyed. Each one of them was super. Now its just groups of mobs that add nothing to the dungeon. Was running a dungeon recently in BFA - the admiral one in Tiragarde I guess and they were just trash mobs everywhere.
---
SCHLLAAAANNDDD
---
If you've never played then I'd say just jump in. Discovering everything in this game was what made it amazing. Don't spoil yourself with guides.
---
People who use chocolate milk are shit warriors.
---
Np!
---
Jesus fuck dude, I've stopped playing WoW once Cata hit. I am by no means a retail fanboy coz I don't play this game anymore. It just tilts me when people are creating some sort of myths regarding old expansions.   
---
Noticing that you are at 50% hp after killing a mob and sitting down to eat is not a mental challenge, besides more downtime there is ZERO difference betwen this and just killing mobs on the go. Same goes for mana conservation in classic - if you are dps you simply need various consumables as there is nothing you can do about starwing mana. You simply run out of mana sometimes and have to wand. For healers you simply use 4 buttons instead of 3, the 4th being a downranked version of a same skill. And again there are no mental gymnastics there - you use downranked version of the spell to heal trash damage, and max rank to heal damage spikes. And that's it, same shit you did in any expansion of WoW except that past vanila you have different spells for different situations so again more variety.   
---
Now what are dailies? You go to npc, he gives you tasks and pay you will rep or some currency. How is that any different fun wise than farming same kind of mob just to drop a shit you can turn for rep? Both sucks, both are meant to gate content and make game last longer.   
---
'Unlimited mana takes any decision making out of the game' - how come then there are differences betwen players in dps/hps they do during certain encounters having similar gear? Oh yeah, boss fight mechanics, the thing that except for Naxx is non existant in classic, and even Naxx mechanics are comparable to random 5 man dungeon past TBC.   
---
Again, you can like classic, but when trying to make a point use examples that actually make sense.   
---
Like I will play the fuck out of classic. Because I'd like to replay the old content, with which I have really good memories. Because I want to experience how well or poorly the end game content aged, to find out what impact 20fps and 200ping had back then on finishing this content.   
---
But again I am aware that I will most likely steamroll the content and I won't pretend that shit is complicated. I am aware that 99% of my gameplay will revolve around spamming 1 button, and I won't pretend that back then rotations were intresting. I am aware that leveling sucks because of downtime, and I won't pretend that having to drink and eat after every 2 mobs is a fun mechanic.
---
That's not pope francis.
---
Those are not blizzard servers.
---
And you are not a real woman!
---
Yes it's a pvp server with RP minded people
---
This was a lot faster than previous months. I guess Classic is more popular than they thought!
---
Anyone named Trade and World yet? :o
---
LOL I am Falcorn on my server :D
---
That's roughly enough time to level one character to 60 and another character to ~30-40 if you played nonstop!
---
For some reason I really doubt thalnos will be almost all Brazilian...and why would it even matter?
---
Share!
---
I actually might check out the RP-PVP server too.  The thing about EST is mostly for scheduling if I end up doing PVE stuff with people.  I go to bed pretty early, which is very early for PST.
---
Yeah it works
---
I got Bj. Happens to be my name irl so I'm pretty thrilled.
---
I did play a 2 letter named character back in diablo 2, which was extremely hard to get back in d2.   and i ended up with that instead.   so its not all bad.     just gonna be weird for awhile  i think
---
Only if you define your life as 'i must progression raid'. 
---
There's people that specialized in 45 min baron runs. there's people that became crafters and ran it as a business. people would twink l19s for battlegrounds. 
---
content wasn't invalidated every 3 months thanks to the latest catchup patch. you want to raid naxx? you need to at least get some BWL / ZG / AQ20&amp;40 gear. that kept farm raids relevant.
---
people turned farming dungeons into an art form. 
---
the thing with classic, was that rep grinds existed. but you had a zillion other ways to find your fun, and honestly raiding was not tuned so hard that BiS was absolutely necessary. 
---
Yes things took forever to do in classic. Argent Dawn rep. Timbermaw rep. Thorium Brotherhood rep. Collecting mats for epic class mounts. Hunter quest. etc.  But you could start a lot of that on day 1, and it would still be relevant content on day 365 or 450 or 550. 
---
In retail, i have no fond memories of Nazjatar or Robognomes because their quests are repetitive and full of gimmicks, the gear is shortly replaced and cosmetics rain down from the sky so who cares about another mount when i have 250 in my collection?
---
You could always switch to pacific server....it's a 3 hour time difference. Could just find an eastern guild on it.
---
No thank you

please no
---
Kinda weird
---
Vertical progression isn’t the only kind of progression there is.
---
No to 1&amp;2 especially
---
Does that mean multi-core support is now in?
---
It's the only content we have until release. And I actually like seeing what names people picked.
---
Maybe, but they will be few and far between.
---
Swifty is alright
---
No its not broski
---
I mean he did it because he doesn't like the other streamers so he chose Herod, not because he's not a "real streamer"
---
How come these server names don't match the servers I was given to chose from?
---
i just read about sharding and no caps?  so i guess im good.  i just want to actually play on the same server as friends.
---
Yeah alliance doesnt give a fuck about the horde generally
---
&gt;help
---
this implies they're not needed. Yes helpful but not necessary.
---
My face reading this thread.
---
I barely remember anything past the entrance to be honest
---
Preference is a preference, not liking someone does not make you petty or shallow. The reason I know very little of him is that I've heard that he's a big wow streamer, I tried him out couple of times but he came out as EXTREMELY boring, every sentence ending with "bro" type of guy, so I never came back. But I also never heard anything bad about him.
---
What a god
---
Why is Bl a shaman?
---
Selling 13 Trout!
---
Is the official release time at the normal reset time for Tuesdays (like 10 am or whatever it is)? Or midnight?
---
I hope to meet the person who took my name and gank them
---
Here is the most important question:  Which one would you like to see without a shirt?  To me, it isn't Asmongold.
---
The point is to clear the current content? There is a lot of psychological gymnastics when it comes to classic gear on this forum, at least when it comes to endgame. No one will be impressed with your MC gear when Naxx is out either.
---
This is definitely true, but you’ll likely be part of a very rare number of players taking their time, and you probably stand much less chance of having cool interactions with others like you may in Classic. Of course this is only guesswork as I haven’t tried!
---
Dude, nothing else is happening for the next two weeks. Let people make their memes and be excited. It's the offseason.

ElvUI is suuuuper customizable / Can move adjust action bar sizes along with literally everything else. This is what my UI looks like for classic basically.
---
[https://imgur.com/2Oxi6Mb](https://imgur.com/2Oxi6Mb)
---
it'll be one of the lower populated servers
---
part of what will contribute to its intimate community charm
---
1. People usually have only one mount in classic. If that mount type matters to you, you should quest in the zone that corresponds. If you want the default for your race, (or are a Warlock/Palladin) don't worry about it.
---
E.g. If you are an elf, but want to ride a mechanical chicken (gnome mount), you need to quest in dun morogh, and follow the dwarves/gnomes storyline.
---
2. I don't know what "BiS" is.
---
3. Be a human. That racial bonus pays off long term if you plan on playing one character for years. Otherwise it just takes time and boredom to grind and grind mobs.
---
4. Why are you worried about farming reputations? No one has hit level 10 yet. Lol.
---
Haha I hadn't heard that story, that's a funny anecdote !
---
Though Wrath was actually enjoyable for a while, even if it brought some systems which eventually became the fuel of a crack epidemic for WoW like Dungeon Finder, which was a nice little tool to have, but it was still new, people mostly were still like they were before, it should probably have been a lobby system instead of an Automatic queue and all.
---
If people upvoted me because they thought I was calling him out on his "personality" then my point completely flew above their head because it's quite the opposite :
---
I'm using this 5 year old video as an evidence that he always had this satirical persona, it's not new at all, only it's not in the same form on a 13min video and on a 5h stream.
---
But I guess that people who take him seriously nowadays also took this video literally, and thought I was calling him out ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
How can you think someone telling you to go to LFR to be #1 on damage meters is serious? Jesus Christ the circle jerk is real here.
---
Maybe my wording got them confused, I'm not the best at english but damn.
---
Discord is much better.
---
But I feel the nostalgia, but its just dumb.
---
With Disc we can communicate via text, send images, videos, files, links, use in the phone, in PC, etc.
---
Thanks, I’m curious to get as many stats regarding server populations as I can.
---
Harambe was just a gorilla.
---
Like you said, if everything is always the same difficulty, then nothing is actually difficult.  Difficulty is relative.  Something is harder than something else.  You need a baseline.
---
RPGs have progression through changes in difficulty.  It's extremely important that players CAN'T do something, then can go out and put in some work, to come back and then they CAN do that thing.  
---
You have the initial wonder and mystery about something new.  Then, you have the realization that this new thing isn't for you.  So you're motivated to work harder to do that exclusive thing.  Finally you come back and complete it.
---
It is 54% horde 46% alliance right now on the Herod discord faction poll.
---
I have a slight problem. I have my name (DeathSwitch) saved on two PvE servers but I'm concerned whether or not they'll be either Alliance or Horde dominated. I got Mikhail as a human paladin on Mankrik too, but it's not on Pagle which I think will be Alliance favored. I wish there was a way to check the stats on faction balance right now.

Do it. Everyone is wayyy overestimating the negative impact streamers will have on the server. Faerlina is going to be comfy.
---
Yes but the time you take getting there you could out level the dungeon
---
It totally does. A menu pops up and you have to select a character before anything goes in the chat.
---
Hallowed be his name
---
I dont play warrior and lets be honest, swifty and i have the same skill, and i am nobody
---
Let's not forget he managed to do it as human hunter as well.
---
Epic.
---
Reason being is that Classic requires the Metal API that Blizzard implemented in BfA. And since Classic is build on the foundation of BfA you’re sadly out of luck.
---
All the realms except the RP PVP realm look horde heavy. Going to be tough finding world pvp as you wait for the slow queues to pop.
---
Yeah, #3 can be fixed with an addon
---
You're both delusional
---
I've played on massively Brazilian servers. They are impossible to play with.
---
Normally I would play and see but I have heared the leveling time is in the span of months, I want to make the "right" decision from the get-go.
---
I a little sad that I know what they were actually saying. :)
---
Decided to recreate my char with the correct looks.
---
Lost the name in that minute..
---
The queue to get in was at 12k at one point lmao.

The server is going to be an absolute madhouse.

Correct, this is Patrick

This had me laughing hard loool

Windows Key. Shift. S.

Croppable screenshots folks. Without paint. You're welcome.
---
That's one thing I'm worried about aswell. Specially since servers come up at 12.00 on eu time. 
---
I remember the hour long queues in vanilla/tbc.
---
I just hope I won't sit in the queue for hours until the middle of the night.
---
Shadow - Grobbulus

I figured the odds were astronomical, but I was still hopeful.

I did get Shadowblade, Zant, and Hylia though. :)

You are in the wrong discord: https://i.imgur.com/JUFyvqZ.png
---
I think so too.. Ppl are really overreacting this
---
Well you're right that there will also be one in the EU to compete with it. The thing is the person who claimed Herod as the PvP server on the wow forums is some ilvl 402 scrub that doesn't even PvP. None of the real PvPers have even seen that post. 
---
Where CDew goes is where all his friends will likely go which will organically make it the NA pvp server.
---
Honestly the thing that I hate the most about going to thalnos is the fact that I might not feel included with most of the player base because I dont know spanish, hell I dont have a firm grasp on the English language either but I cant wait to see how everone interacts.
---
Vintage memes for vintage games.
---
retail is just so butchered, every class feels kinda the same and i don't know how this is even possible in the first place... nothing is really unique anymore, no roleplay aspect basically, we have no talents, no skills, no nothing. 
---
whats left is the great world design from a once glorious game. BUT HOLD ON! WE CAN PLAY IT SOON! OUR SUFFER WILL BE OVER!
---
What video card is it? Boot camp may work for you. I had this problem on a 2011 iMac.

If that happens they will throw up realm queues and open up free transfers.

What name were you trying for?

I believe Redridge Mountains were the lowest level flagged for PvP starting zone in that area of the map.  Elwynn Forest and Westfall were safe zones.
---
welp, there goes my excitement for classic
---
too bad he turned into a nutter

If you think the outlaw nerfs are going to be enough to stop them from still being the best M+ class, I've got bad news for you.
---
Google "wow Classic global release"
---
Move Mankrik's wife.
---
usually first 2 weeks 
---
Just going by the more popular EQ TLP releases .... they are usually about 1-1.5 weeks of que timer
---
with wow being a bit more popular, id say 2-2.5
---
Just watched it again last night, I feel like its necessary before going into classic again.
---
Same but at least with decent names that aren't that hard to get you can use the same names everywhere
---
Fucking spot on LOL

It is very unlikely.

Server choice checks out
---
Ranking is objective. Faster queues does not mean faster ranking. You get the upper ranks relative to others in that rank in your faction. So even if queues are slower, you can hypothetically still get hwl doing half the bgs alliance does if all other horde are earning honor just as slow or slower than you.

Holy Priest blessing the Blizzard servers ...
---
Surprised you're not a balance druid
---
I do hope that all the people that have strong feelings about SA and BR players being on the server have already made plans to jump ship and take their toxicity with them.
---
They were able to burn through it cause character creation takes all of two minutes. When people log in and stay in for hours, that 10k queue is going take a lot more than a few minutes.
---
Sooooo... it is a stun (can be resisted with Hardiness) but it functions like an incapacitate in that it can be broken by damage?
---
to get to max level, yes, but you should have a good feel for how your class plays by 10 or 20.
---
&gt;right decision
---
There is no "wrong" decision, they are just different. Can you play the game as a gnome warrior tank? Of course. Could you choose a different race to get an extra 1% effective hit points (dodge) by choosing an elf instead? Yea, but that doesn't make the gnome a wrong choice.
---
Just pick things that appeal to you. The bigger questions you should be asking yourself are:
---
* when I hit /dance, what do I want my character to do?
---
* Do I like the default mount that comes with this race?
---
* Do I want to be doing spell damage, ranged damage, have energy mechanics/rage mechanics/Mana, wear heavy armor, Heal groups, Tank damage and direct the course of the fight, etc
---
Still not decided between shaman, paladin and druid. Which would fit most?
---
I want the most useless dps spec that is also the least played.
---
lmfao

Bloodsail represent. Got the names I wanted, so I'm hyped to see how the community is. Lower populations are more my taste anyway, so I'm looking forwards to it.
---
This is basically what Blizzard said was the core of their reasoning, wasn't it? They didn't want to have to merge servers after the "tourists" were gone, so it's doubtful they'd create new servers based on initial demand. 
---
Basically, what you're saying: If the pop persists longer than they thought, they'll revisit the idea.
---
But do we REEEEEALLY get joy from a post by someone that got the names “blade”, “hairy”, and “stick”? So many of the posts about what names they got are pretty boring with uninteresting names.
---
Does sarcastically pretending like you don't know what he's talking about make you feel clever?  Cause no one thinks you're clever.
---
He doesn’t have to. This community does nothing but shit on streamers constantly, so why does he have to do anything when the community is just going to keep shitting on him anyways? You can’t have your cake and eat it.
---
I got Nightmare, Logic, and Joker. Pretty happy 😁
---
“But Reddit said I could play whatever I wanted”
---
Based on what I know, you can do it, you just need to be careful.
---
This was the real reason why they gave Horde bloodelves in TBC. They needed to fix this gross faction imbalance.
---
Rise up sons of the Horde blood and glory await us! 
---
Cut down the Alliance dogs where they stand, their wealth belongs to the Horde.

I`m not naive, thank you. Not wanting to change Classic. In fact, I never mentioned it.

I don't use push to talk. My mic doesn't pick up sound unless I talk. And I mute it if I'm about to sneeze or cough or something.
---
I also live alone without pets so there's no noise.
---
So vanilla you didn't play Warcraft 3? xD
---
Guild vault or summoning stones that work.
---
To your point on vanilla farming vs dailys. There isn't much difference in the time to outcome, but I think there is a key psychological difference. Being able to farm exactly how much or what you want gives freedom, while doing set quests on a timer feels like you are locked into something.
---
I try to avoid any game that has those daily incentives because it's there to just keep you logging in every day. Maybe I still fall behind if I don't farm in vanilla wow but at least I can do it on my time and pace.
---
Similarly to your point on mob killing. Killing mobs in classic is not difficult and like you say it takes more time,  but the difference I notice is how much my gear changes impact that experience. Getting pieces of loot feels better and more rewarding due to their scarcity.
---
A lot of what makes vanilla enjoyable has nothing to do with mechanics or complexity, almost strictly rpg elements, character individuality, and sense of community. It's a feel good wow.
---
The times when you get camped into a long respawn timer will be few and far between.  expect it when you are fresh into a zone but once you are a few levels in you will start to tip the scales in your favor and the bullies will have moved on to the next zone
---
I wasn't sure that I would resub. To be fair I was bored yeaterday out of my mind and pulled the trigger. Im not planning on racing to 60 and the addons I will use are few. Bartender, a quest tracker, and a castbar. Dont really need anything else. Oh well thanks for the help.
---
why would you EVER want to be a Retribution Paladin?
---
Why would you choose a server with a blatantly racist name? Edgelord much?
---
implying NA has any competition
---
But how would your guildies know other than speculation?
---
‘terrorist’ was considered mature language, but ‘terrorists’ wasn’t
---
I feel bad for the downvotes you got. This went over a lot of people's heads.
---
The only problem I found is that every time you click 'Create Character' the settings are randomized, so you'll have to memorize what faces/characteristics come after the one you want rather than how many clicks over it is.
---
Jesus, years of playing retail has your fried your brain into actually believing this...
---
Thank. Do you have a link by chance?
---
I'm worried for the first week but meh after that.
---
Better guilds won't let you raid as elemental or enhancement, but there are plenty of other guilds that will.
---
Just be prepared to do kinda shit damage (as in, roughly 40% of what a warrior or rogue would be doing) and not really contributing anything that a resto shaman wouldn't.
---
Hmm... Most of the Brazillians will go to Thalnos and a few will go to Mankrik. Also, streamers did move to Faerlina, didn't they? I don't get this "Hold the line" thing.
---
Troll
---
Let's say you're wandering the world and you find another factions player
---
+ They're easily '1-shotable' by you
---
+ It'd be a trivial button press, you probably wouldn't even need to stop moving/do whatever you were doing (a single global cooldown)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Would you kill them?
---
I (without hesitation) would say yes, and that's probably the reason why your friends are concerned about a PvP server. Would you offer a stay of execution in the same circumstances?
---
Me too, edgelord names != immature names
---
There are like 100 name trade threads because people keep making their own
---
That's honestly not a bad imbalance for a pvp server. There have been servers with a much bigger divide.
---
Is this true?
---
Sooooo I didn't read information about name reservation beyond the date and time so I didn't know I could reserve 3 names and I actually was able to reserve 4? Here is [proof](https://imgur.com/a/KMC582U) of my character select screen, i left the last letter of names uncovered so you can see they are different names and not clever editing.
---
Ha, you fool. He has SIX ^honorary degrees and a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering. You dare question his qualifications?
---
Horde or Alliance Johnny?
---
I'm going 31/5/15 on my alt warrior.
---
Its great for leveling and will sufficient for all 5mans
---
The Spanish community announced Shazz as it's main server, have fun xddd
---
Thanks for reminding me that class quests used to exist. I'm so excited :D
---
Oh hell, Son, I was high that day. That doesn't make any sense at all, you can be second, third, fourth... hell you can even be fifth.
---
You cannot access certain areas/dungeons without flying.  No Kara attunement.  People seem to forget that Outlands was designed with flying in mind.  Same with WotLK.  It wasn't until cata and being able to fly everywhere that made it dumb.
---
Dungeons are a lot more fun to run for a group of 5 than leveling would be (leveling as a 5-man is pretty slow). Since you guys can play outside of the time slot set a level goal each week so you can all be ready for the next one. If you're playing casual try to run as many of the different dungeons as you can, they're all fun and even running to the far away ones and experiencing the world together will be fun. On weeks where not everyone is ready, or if there is a big level gap between dungeons, grinding separately on discord will be fun, and will build anticipation for the run next week.
---
If some of you have more time than others you can focus on crafting and accessing optional content for the party (like obtaining the ZF mallet) without getting too high level.
---
Idk what this has to do with the retarded RP Hydraxian Waterlords server :D  
---
btw BANISH THE SPANISH ofc!
---
That and they completely skipped over the existence of Horde, which I suspect was to help keep the episode plot focused and not overwhelm non-WoW fans.
---
For the horde players wanting to run Deadmines... take the Zep to Grom’Gol in STV, then swim north along then west coast. It’s really not a long run(swim) to get there. And if the place is swarming with alliance it’ll take four corpse runs tops to get the full party inside.
---
I actually hate how in modern wow all loot comes from just 1 corpse. Idk why but I enjoy looting items from multiple mobs. Makes it feel like I get more loot or a higher chance at a rare item dropping.
---
As Esfand says, the most important stat for a ret paladin is Charisma.
---
1.5 weeks for stv. Bunch of baddies over here
---
I’m not, I’m only looking at PvE Pacific servers. Either Atiesh or Myzrael. I couldn’t figure out why Pagle had so many more people; I thought maybe it was the name or something. I mean, I’m guessing that’s why Herod is way more popular than Thalnos.
---
Remindme! 15 days
---
From everything I've read on it, the game is solely about end game now. So current players creating new toons want to be level cap yesterday.
---
Do you know if server population hardcap has been released by blizz yet ?
---
I'm sure the guy can do that himself. He's actively athletic and by no means slow. Having taken a recent review of his channel it looks more like the game and the platforms have changed than his ability to play world of warcraft at a high level. Little reason to make content for people who won't watch it because edited sections of your livestream bring in better viewership.

i lost my name on herod too that i made on lightnings blade in 2005! Coinstar is the name. guess we have to rebrand in wow classic now too lol
---
Yeah. We all got the names we wanted. Me and the spouse got our very first character names. Guess that’s also a benefit of being lower pop.
---
Bloodsail represent!
---
/r/BloodsailBuccaneers
---
Do you need a hug?
---
Everyone seems to be against the use of special characters. Does that mean a name like Torbjörn would be unacceptable even though it's more accurate than Torbjorn?
---
We all know that, but I respectfully disagree with big numbers are not important. I tank and heal most of the time and the easiest times were always with competent dps that melted the boss.
---
Battle of the Atlantic do you need to re watch the vods???
---
Are they really all rolling on one server? Oh boy.
---
I mean, he has to cope with the fact that not every issue can be settled like a meeting.
---
[Crossroads on 7](https://i.imgur.com/Rxh5Pj0.png)
---
Leave him behind, he's not worthy.
---
Lol dude....you're  fuck. Don't comment on shit.
---
That is quite unique, i have yet to come across such experience
---
Horde in AV is like layering in Classic:  it's only bad if you want it to be bad.
---
I love him, he seems like good people.
---
Had to wait hour and a half...
---
How so they know his name
---
yeah ONLY ALLIANCE grind for AV rep, dont even bother wasting your time trying as horde. sad really
---
Oprahwindfury was too long unfortunately. Also I bet you're fun at parties
---
Are you kidding me... I chose this server because I assumed it would be a quiet east coast PvP server. Especially with all those streamers living out west. Damnit, well already got my name so looks like I'm in on the fun.
---
 I dunno if I wanna pretend there's some nobility to one side or the other, but there were definitely a few times questing trogs in Loch Modan where either I or a groupmate forgot to check levels before a pull, and these times presented great opportunity for both teachable moments and comedy.
---
Youre right about that. Ive mostly played horde, but am playing ally in classic. I like both factions, but prefer ally. Male night elf master race. The die-hard horde players I know hate alliance and would never consider them.
---
The facts are like the reddit version of trump on fox news
---
You'll stumble across plenty of quests just as you progress the content. There are specific 'group' quests (with 'Elite' mobs) that generally weren't designed with solo play in mind (as level appropriate content).
---
'Hogger' is a good one in a human zone, but that's more 'bounty hunting' than a dungeon type challenge.
---
If your group members are the types who'd be interested in 'RPG' games they shouldn't get bored. As an organised group of 5 especially you can even challenge content that is 'beyond' your level, and the need to coordinate and handle situations where you're weaker than your opponents will keep the team interested.
---
If you're afraid of failure (or making mistakes in general) Classic WoW isn't really for you, even if you have the time. You need to be able to sit back and have a laugh with your mates when someone does something stupid, or something goes horribly wrong. Part of the thrill is being successful, or at least surviving/escaping.
---
Well the queue was to reserve names so... people got in. Made their names. Logged out.
---
In launch people won't be logging out so that queue will take much longer.... Not even talking aboutt the Big portion of people Who don't caree about names and will resub on launch

The only feature I would be okay with them adding is the barbershop.

Hm.. I specifically tested this on Horde as an Orc.  I ran to Tirisfal Glades at Level 1, and I was not able to access the level 1 quest with the letter sending you to the trainer (even though I completed the pre-req level 1 quest in Deathknell).  At level 10, I was not able to get the quest from the woman in the inn in Brill sending me to Mennet Carkad in UC, and when I went to speak to him he did not have a quest for me either.  Not sure if I missed something?  When I went back to Razor Hill I was able to get the level 10 quest  leading to the Blade of Cunning there with no issues.
---
Can't you double check by downloading an addon, going to character selection screen and clicking on the addon button down on the lower left corner of the screen to see if its there?
---
Gonna guess alliance
---
Honestly, you could have fear of missing out on any server; if you hear about a cool event happening on another, it can kinda suck. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the time and friends that you spend and make on your own little corner of the World of Warcraft. :)
---
he won't get it
---
Lol love that I’m not the only one crossing over
---
Do you also think that Borat is a real person? Genuinely curious.
---
Because there is a higher demand? And interesting how you know how good Germans speak english or other languages, since its taught in fourth grade. Didnt had the feeling french people are that fluently speaking english e.g.. kinda got the feeling you dont like Germans.
---
POM Pyro Mage wants to know your location.

Wow that is sick!!

Ret pally.
---
Ok this one made me laugh.
---
This reminds me... when my stress character approached Orgrimmar for the first the awesome music didn't kick in like it's supposed to. It just went quiet until I got inside then it played some chill stuff like you'd hear in the cleft of shadow.
---
I mean, yeah we need the chair count right, but that music is a big part of a city's impact.
---
Again, once you’re lvl 20 you’ll be 5/5 in both until 60. Unless you want to try and argue not going spirit tap at all. 
---
But let me hear these facts where going wand spec without a wand is better than spirit tap.
---
shhhhhhhh.....
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers!
---
Fucking ***YARR!***
---
i got her an account aswell the best way to make your woman happy with wow is to include them
---
Asmon actually runs a guild too, some of the other streamers are either just officers or do not run guilds at all.  As some others have said, all he has to do is flex and he has 100s of other players backing him up.  If you were in the stress test while him or Esfand were organizing raids, the chat can get super obnoxious.  Plus the fact that while they were running raids or counter raids, the layering made it so if you weren't in their group, you didn't literally see any action.

A game mixing tower defense and strategy. If you were a warcraft 3 fan this games mechanics are very similar. Its mission based so just play what you want. the story line is under whelming.

I mostly just like it because it's different from an RPG and I'm hoping it will keep.ke fresh until the 26th
---
he probably makes over 30k a month
---
An index of all API/Macro options/conditions/functions/stuff that also provides detailed descriptions on implementation/usage.
---
Haven’t been playing that many games, but recently picked back up an old flash game called Realm of the Mad God. Besides that it’s mainly CSGO.
---
But since you get rep from killing the bosses won’t the winning side gain the most rep?
---
I haven't been on Mannoroth in years I don't know how I got by without my regular chair assessments.  Good to see you're still passionate about your work.
---
Very nice. Love the drawings
---
&gt; competent dps
---
This discussion is not about competent dps, it's about incompetent fools that value big numbers over the group.
---
This is amazing! But not to brag, but I too made myself a leveling sheet... on a notepad... in chicken scratch.
---
You said that and I just remembered the hallway gauntlet in Shattered Halls (I think? Hellfire Pen lev 70 dungeon in TBC). That was actually pretty cool.
---
That's pretty awesome
---
I hope this comes to the EU store. That motley crue t-shirt is sick!
---
You got me
---
in contested zones a lot of players attack on sight and it makes the game so much more fun in my opinion. Yeah you get ganked sometimes, but theres so many options. The local defense is gonna say "blah blah is under attack!" And the bored high levels will come by to clear it out or start a war. I never felt like it made it impossible to level, just adds a whole level of gameplay that I wouldn't play classic wow without
---
*applies soulstone*
---
Raid finder.
---
Nah layering gonna prevent that unless people make an effort to form up raids. Just big organic wpvp will not happen while layering is active.
---
And we should all have free college right?
---
Thank you kind stranger! Z-perl and Dominos work makes my day.
---
Tbh I think you are really hurting yourself by going pve only, might be some cases where ittl get annoying but I think a massive part of the game is missing without it.
---
For me it was being a total noob and running Diremaul with friends. It was super late night, like 3am and I was so tired 
---
We wiped and got lost so I told them just find me and rez me
---
I fell asleep as they ran back and they kept calling my phone until I woke up lmao

Either they do, or they don’t.
---
It will happen to you a couple of times, but before long you will make it a habit to check your ammo when re-upping on other things like food and water
---
It's not a lot of time to play but good on you for not neglecting your child like I imagine a lot of fathers would do when getting deep into an mmo.  I've got 2 hours a day to play but I couldn't imagine I'd have any time to play or sleep if I had a kid.
---
You mean DM?
---
then what is your solution to the problem layering is fixing?
---
Never played wow hardcore, I just dabbled a bit in PvP.
---
But I used to play CS at a higher level and I didn't use PTT there either. If you set it up properly you shouldn't have any issues.
---
Retail!
---
Naw I kid. I just finished playing Return of the Obra Dinn. Damn good about 10 hrs.
---
PSA: People can post any content they want to and you can upvote or downvote freely. 
---
People obviously do care about name reservations since they get upvoted.
---
I will dispense no food, no water, and no portals until there is a raid spot for every good boy and girl!
---
I remember pet food being a much bigger concern.
---
I like that you had to add Earth. As if the the Troll don't smoke some good shit...
---
You will 10000% forget to buy ammo at times and it is super annoying. Especially if it's your first time playing hunter. My tip, buy wayyy to much ammo and delete it as your bags fill. You can buy ammo for super cheap so your not wasting too much gold.
---
the locusts will die out quick outside of major cities and easy to get to zones because they won't be leveling anyways.
---
Yeah once it happens bad you'll never forgot. Also, quivers give flat bonus to attack speed....
---
It's still common nowadays too, just not *as* common
---
Am 30 and race downhill mountainbiking. It is nevee to late to follow your dreams!

Fucking idiots.
---
I'm on mobile, but on YouTube jokerdtv (leveled to 60 in 2 days 17 hours /played by aoe grinding) has a video explaining 20+ things that are different with aoe grinding on classic compared to pservers
---
For a while I would forget and just melee, once I took up Engineer I started to make it a habit of refill my ammo bags with ammo, and making sure I go back once I had 1 or 2 stacks.
---
You sound like a douche. Thank you.
---
Yeah I think it's not longer possible with no heavy server load lol
---
Scaling is necessary in retail as it is now. 1-110s are basically a giant tutorial. The world needs a revamp. I don't like the lack of progression myself, but just removing scaling without a massive overhaul of levelling experience won't really change anything to the better.
---
Oh, they will be ganked alright.
---
Cuz your post about wpvp was a response that didnt talk about bathing in blue blood and scream zugzug or lok'tar ogar.
---
lol dude I wana see where this is going down and what names/how much people are paying, do you know?
---
Personally, I've had my fill of the types that flock to twitch/twitch chat (not just WoW-related, either) to want to avoid any bleed over from their followers online. That said, I never dealt with queue times when I was playing back in the day, so that might get irritating if I roll Herod, too, idk.
---
This is just name creation chill.
---
Oops! Someone forgot to switch accounts!
---
according to Snutz ooga will not be rolling Faerlina =( sad dayz bois.
---
Wow you got a whole server to yourself
---
WTB Saint on Shazzrah EU

let me know what you want

Try? There isn’t much trying to get that. It just happens.
---
Instructions unclear, phone was very difficult to cut with scissors. Phone stopped working
---
No you get used too it almost immediately. It's more of a problem at smaller quiver sizes were you might have to purposefully go buy ammo. When you get a decent-sized quiver you usually just top it off whenever you're in town. You can mail arrows to yourself as well i belive for more convenience.

Great to hear. Really quite broken that an epic 2 hander is so easily available as soon as you hit 60. Makes you wonder why people talk of Vanilla like Dark Souls or something

since it's singular I would say it's more prevalent to the geometric shape/number not the muscle groups (well which are named after the geometric shape)

Some of us already re-experienced vanilla WoW thorough PS and know quite well what we are getting ourselves into
---
You'll learn very quickly from experience, if not you can still let your pet do the hard work (just make so you don't let your pet do all of it).
---
I was pretty excited for scaling at the time because it meant leveling alts was more enjoyable due to experiencing zones I hadn't really done much before (plus heirlooms make you go so fast you outlevel non-scaled content too quickly to enjoy).
---
But now I really do miss the sense of actual progression and getting stronger, which has been made worse by things like stat squishes, ability pruning, and talent changes
---
/r/PenmanshipPorn/

yes, that's what I'm saying.

me and my 2 friends used to mess around with the vent text-to-speech.  there were certain things you could type in to make weird sounds.  'bu' for some reason came out as "bushels"

---
right?
---
Yes I agree. The most memorable time for me in WoW was during TBC. It improved Vanilla and introduced Heroics which were a blast. Introduced 10 man and 25 man raids, which were amazing. How can anyone forget their Kara runs? By the time we were done with that place, I knew the raid inside out. 
---
I had most fun in TBC. Not Vanilla. Not WoTLK. 
---
But I don’t think Classic should take that path. They should create new content at 60 post naxx. Because if they make TBC and then WoTLK, we’ll end up with the same game people are avoiding today.
---
Im guessing you didnt try out pservers
---
Can a fellow druid get an electronic copy of this so I can use it also?
---
A box with magic in it
---
the same that was implemented 14 years ago
---
Nobody can have a perfect answer on how often you will get ganked.  But the way I looked at it was every time I got ganked I would pay the other faction back 10x.
---
I'm gonna play a little every night and have more fun then you lol.
---
Gratz man!

The problem is getting past the logging in part, which is a slog

Well shit!  I actually didn't consider how it would be more fitting for a DK, never played one, fortunately they aren't in Classic,  but now you made me realize it might have suited the lock more...  :(

Lol your a fool. I had a blast back in the day leveling in barrens. The main memory that sticks out is 4 high levels allies attacking xroads, after about an hour of them harassing us all the lowbies finally just started attacking the allies regardless of the level difference. We fought with them for a solid 30 minutes and managed to kill 2 before high level horde finally rolled in to help. 
---
Assuming you rolled a PvE server, so enjoying being a carebear.
---
 https://imgur.com/fNweXNz  just thought of a bunch of dota boys
---
So putting 2-3 points into spirit tap, and then putting 1-2 points into wand spec before you even get a wand is somehow noticeably worse than going straight into 5/5 wand. 
---
I hope your strategy saves you all of 10 minutes.

I totally made a subreddit https://old.reddit.com/r/DadBodHerod/

I like that scaling gives you the freedom to decide for yourself where you want to go in the world.  Leveling up in Vanilla/Classic is a linear path.  You just follow the zone levels and that's about it, you don't have a choice unless you want to go through the trouble of traveling to the other continent to follow the level path there.  It can get tedious when you're on your second or third day questing in Desolace and you don't really have a choice but to keep slogging through it.  Scaling might not be the best solution, but I do think the experience of leveling is a lot better in Retail than it will be in Classic.
---
i dont use them sometimes when i type :0  or :) it turns into a face

He wasn’t the only grim back in the day.
---
Just because he made some pvp videos doesn’t mean he’s the real Grim.
---
4 letter words are hard to get so
---
Are you high? No WPVP on PVE servers? H’wat?
---
I don't care about the name thing, but I briefly played the stress test and MAN, I've not anticipated a game release this much since Diablo II, or Age of Mythology.
---
That....is dumb and upsets me way more than it should. I was looking forward to the day long battles.
---
Where did they say this?
---
Bucky eh? Nan of culture there.
---
Looking for that priest dad build...
---
Ehhhh, arrr, I dunno about that. Sure they can reset but a great duellist they are not.
---
First question for you
---
Has he tried classic?
---
If your answer is yes then follow step 1
---
If your answer is no steps 2-3
---
Step 1. Your friend is a lost cause, find a new friend
---
Step 2. Recommend some you tube video's of people leveling as well as a class guide to his preferred class
---
Step 3. convince him to try out a pserver
---
If steps 2 and 3 dont work I refer you to  step 1.
---
That night elf on the cover looks exactly like my aunt and it has always annoyed me for some reason
---
I stared at this for 10 seconds straight and I already started to see hidden images. That's enough Reddit for me today.
---
Depends what guild you are in. Some people just casually raid. If you are too looking to be a casual raider play what you enjoy and find a guild that also play what they enjoy.
---
Yeah I guess. It just seems dumb that most specs aren't viable, I just wish that certain classes had more freedom.
---
Imagine having a brain as smooth as this guy’s
---
There is no real 'Grim'. That name is so common that it can't be claimed.
---
I have a really shiddy red-blue deck that uses Guttrsnipe as a staple with a barrage of flying creatures, defenders, and cypher spells. It's offensively annoying.

Classic raiding can't even hold a candle to retail raiding, but aside from that and quality of life stuff like transmog yeah I can agree Classic is a superior role-playing game ezperience.
---
Behind the diminished social and leveling experiences, this is a huge reason why retail can’t keep my interest. As soon as a game becomes an obvious chore just for the sake of being a chore, I lose interest.

That might've existed back in the day, but I think this might be more prevalent now that classic has essentially been "solved".
---
Yea. A 29 mage would’ve never taken down the 39 lock lol. I see what you’re saying.
---
That's actually not true at all. They used to say it's "97%" settled science but the true number is more than 99%. There's just no evidence to back an alternate hypothesis that the climate isn't changing more rapidly today than it has in billions of years.
---
It's not about Bill Nye per se, it's about changing our lifestyle quickly enough that we don't destroy most life on Earth. (But Bill Nye isn't paid by the oil companies the "dissenters" are paid by he's simply paid by Netflix and the likes for his programming.)
---
If you disagree on the "settled science" bit you are stating you don't happen to think carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases, which would be to day you don't understand the very basics of the conversation.

That's a really long name - surprised it got accepted.

Why did you switch to Fairbanks from Herod? Just curious.

Happy to see old time players like us coming back :~)
---
Well they’ve talked about it in an interview already. They said there is a possibility they will make content at 60 post-Naxx. They did say it’s up to the playerbase. 
---
I mean that’s exactly what happened to OSRS. People wanted the classic gameplay with new content. If Jagex is capable of doing it and being successful at it, I don’t see why Blizzard cannot.
---
So I’d say it’s a possibility but it’s still too early to talk about what’s next.
---
Yeah but he said this guy was the REAL ONE in caps so it sounds legit
---
Hopefully on Herod, I'd love to come across you on my paladin named "Manwich"

Heheh
---
There are only two decent excuses constantly regurgitated for why not to balance out the specs:              
---
         
---
1.) It will change the raid dynamic, in other words, some classes/specs might get invited more than others and to the Classes that expect raid spots like mages, warriors, and priests. So they think thats not fair, the irony is completely lost on them.             
---
           
---
2.) Blizzard will fuck it up, and while I'm super hoping for TBC being announced and released in 2 years because of how amazing Class balance in TBC was, I have to agree. Almost 100% Blizzard especially today's Blizzard in particular cant be trusted to balance anything and they would 100% completely fuck it up way worse.                   
---
               
---
I would rather play Classic as is and hope for TBC later than have the wondertards at Blizzard who made WOD, Legion and BFA try to do anything outside of just giving us a replica of Vanilla.
---
LMAO WHY DID PEOPLE EVER DO THAT? till this day I don't get it. That and sniffle into the mic. WHYYY

Thalnos is still an English official language server. Some Brazilian and South American folks have said they are going to play on it, but server rules are still that public channels are required to be in English.

It's possible that people in Central and Western Canada are going somewhere else, I primarily know people in Eastern Canada.

Difference between the servers will be only few thousands. They will be packed... if not already compared to NA servers.

Follow your temptation. Slay Alliance with Daddy
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/DadBodHerod/
---
No, and, and by the way.. you don't want that to do that either. You think you do, but you don't.
---
Remember when you had to like spam cities and say "need a tank need a tank need a tank" during the burning crusade days? You don't remember that because now you just push a button that says go to the dungeon. You don't want to do that.
---
Remember that one bug that really pissed you off that we fixed two years ago? Still there in the past.
---
Due to the race mechanics, Allys are favored because they have 1 really good choke they can hold, while Hordes defense is a lot better overall but staggered.
---
Since 1.12 is a race though, most of your defences get run by, so the fact that alliance have 1 good spot to hold while Horde have many decent ones give Allys the advantage.
---
Pre 1.11 id say Horde had the advantage since the midfield strongly favors Horde and tempo was really big in AV since a lot of people gave up pretty easily.
---
Because once you begin making class changes in the name of balance you end up in a never ending cycle to try and make everything "fairer" just like on retail and it's ultimately a goal that you'll never achieve. 
---
Even a seemingly small change that seems quite minor on the outside could potentially have a big impact on the meta and it's just not worth opening that can of worms when class "balance" while not exactly the most fair in Vanilla isn't seen as an issue or something that effects the enjoyment of the game.
---
"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Not according to Blizzard tho
---
4 warlocks at most, especially in phase 1
---
I’ve not once ever been in a loot council guild that didn’t quickly devolve into (officers first, core raiders second). Dkp is a fair system, you want it? You put the work into it. What system do you suggest
---
Accept him into your heart and you will know his jungly peace.

I hope so. Because from what I hear, Discord has replaced it. I also hear that Fortnite children scream on it, and Pokémon kids invite me, because they see me sitting on my phone.
---
Will never download it, will never try it.
---
Ventrilo or nothing for me.
---
I didn’t get my all my names... I barely got 1
---
&gt; Ok, but what's your point? Classic is going to have far more than 350k players during the first week or so
---
source? I thought we were dealing in facts?
---
&gt;Your entire response to layering has been "but it launched just fine without it" even though the launch had a ton of issues. How is that not claiming that the launch didn't have problems?
---
fine =/= perfect. I have never said that it had no issues during launch. But here's a fact: the game did fine without layering
---
I think a lot of people are ignoring your point, the flood is seriously going to be a problem with speed leveling. Even assuming the servers are perfect.
---
It fills you up and prevents you from eating less healthy snacks, the study was more about the behavioral aspect in kids. Obviously the skim milk is less calories and such, but 2% or whole milk is healthier than sugary snacks you would likely be tempted to eat since the skim milk doesn't satisfy your hunger.
---
That’s awesome, gratz!
---
Got both.  Alfougin - dwarf paladin.
---
As a casual player i distinctly remember doing MC in one evening with a raid full of people still using at least 50% blues without any consumables of note.
---
People are vastly overestimating MC's difficulty with a group of 40 people who are somewhat familiar with the mechanics. Min-maxing that raid was absolutely unnecessary.
---
BWL only really had Vaelastrasz and Nefarian which required any real gearing/consumable effort. If you could clear Vael you could clear every single boss up to Nefarian, and the only real reason the last one was difficult in that regard was because of the required onyxia cloaks.
---
The *real* difficulty in classic raids was not in gearing or consumables, as others have already mentioned (at least up to twin emps in aq4), but in getting 40 people to work together.
---
its possible that the login queue is separate from the actual capacity of the "server".  ex: its there to throttle connections to the authentication database
---
That's not surprising. As horde you most likely don't do DM, Stockades just like Alliance usually skip Wailing Caverns and Shadowfang Keep.
---
Well it is near empty isn't it? Ever since layering has been announced, most critiscsm about the system or posts asking for clarification over it's removal before phase 1 has been mostly locked or removed on the wow forums, Blizzard also hasn't made any comments or taken action on the many concerns posted about the system as well. I think that's a pretty good justification to be sceptical over their claims of planning to eventually disable it.
---
Yeah dawg I can bring my 4 cd's to school tomorrow so he can install the game
---
Classic is about reliving the experience and meta
---
If you balance classes then it changes the meta and will lead to the devs to need to tweak boss fights to balance the new meta.
---
In vanilla wow you couldn’t interact with NPCs while in Druid shapeshift forms
---
Age Of Wonders: Planetfall is the game my dudes. It's like AoW 3, but polished and with a cool sci fi theme :)

Ok let's take another example from retail unforunately. Mythic + has been "solved" but unless you are aiming for firsts/times or super high stuff people really don't care as much.

Not everyone is going to be playing min-max.

Refusing versus not wanting to.

Didn't even subscribe so you had to draw it? Guess there is a step below taking a picture of your screen with a phone.

---
It actually reached 1.1 million within a year and spiked during the first summer. By the time BC was out, it was more like 8 million. The fastest growth was during Vanilla. The peak was reached by mid WotLK, at 12 million, but it had gotten to 11 million at least in BC. The more they altered the original design, they more they cause people to leave.
---
If anyone knows who took the name "Jet" on Whitemane PvP PLEASE LET ME KNOW! Im willing to do some negotiating for the name. Thank you.

I'm confused at what you are saying here.

idk he just said that ooga gang will not be on faerlina.... I was sad when I heard it cause ooga and the alliance version was pretty hilarious lmao they at least made the ganks entertaining.
---
He is a snowflake
---
I used to take adderall sometimes before doing competitive cs tournaments back in the day. I could see cocaine having similar effects. Not sure how that would be fun or worth doing when playing wow though lol
---
Just look at this Reddit, the Forum or the Discord servers, all full of people being mean to each other, racists, etc.  
---
It's amazing how this is taking the worst out of a lot of people.
---
The craziest thing is that most modern wow fans actually *asked for it*. Imagine asking for a way to making leveling even worse than it already is.
---
This is art. Amazing aesthetic.
---
Did your gloves fit?
---
Hah, game hasn’t launched and we know which server is the most toxic... crazy times we live in.
---
I usually just drink water or Gatorade. Soda isn’t good for you.
---
I made horde on Herod and alliance on faerlina
---
So the whole community sucks because of one guy?
---
That's a pretty narrow minded view. You would think you'd be more progressive, but I guess not.
---
I mean the word casual seems kind of antithetical to what you are doing here.

Technically it still works it's just a 0.1% dps increase instead of the 6% increase in pve.

It's not surprising. Reddit polls are only good for determining where people on Reddit are gonna go. Shitloads of people were reserving names last night. The polls might be useful for really basic ideas, like for example, we know Grobbulus won't be DoA, but it's not good for exacting numbers at all.
---
I've heard this argument umpteen times. If that's all you're seeing, and other people are saying different, have you considered that YOU are the problem?
---
You don't earn gear from DKP. You show up, and be a warm body and get points, then use those points to take gear from the people carrying your useless ass. 
---
Pfft, earned. I've seen more teams go under because some scrublord saved every bit of DKP and bought a rare BIS item, then the others flipped shit and bailed. 
---
Every system has flaws, but goddammit, anyone flying the flag of DKP being superior is either looking to game the system and fuck their own guildies over, or completely rose tinted goggles level of retarded.
---
I need an est server
---
why "in this community" and not "in this guild" ?

And nobody cares about your shitty guild drama

Don't be ridiculous. These are bolts to hold Kalimdor in place.

yes dude, i remember every time Tiberium showed up in Org he would say something like "I just flew in from Thunder Bluff and boy are my arms tired", which always pissed someone off for some reason
---
That one is red, I think they are talking about the pink robe from kuranaxx in aq20
---
BRO, im down. ive rolled on mirage raceway.
---
Sure it’s viable but it’s significantly weaker than all the other races who all have useful racials. Perception is useless because you can never anticipate when to use it. 
---
Even Dwarf Warriors are really strong because you can break out of blind and poison. 
---
Night Elf Warriors get shadowmeld which opens up a ton of opportunities in pvp. You can ambush people, you can guard flags, you can eat while shadowmelded etc.
---
I’m looking for “Gee” on Herod. Please DM me if you have it or know the person who does
---
This is definitely not the right realm. He/she wants population balance and Herod is far from it. Horde dominated.
---
Grobbulus is the right decision. Near perfect balance Alliance to Horde ratio. Plus it's RP-PVP, you get the best of both worlds.
---
Mark my words, it'll be one of the best communities to be apart of.
---
It's not time yet.
---
I like it because i have done way too much leveling in wow since about WOTLK when i started making alts, that it just lets me do what i want to do. Lets me follow storylines i want to follow instead of being forced into the next zone just because im losing alot of time and exp by doing it. 
---
Retail made it so that nothing in leveling is hard, I never really found problems with being under the proper level in retail, I honestly dont remember a time i ever died since like BC that was because of me being low level, and not just pulling too much shit.
---
I drink whiskey, neat. Now get the hell off of my lawn.

Sent you a PM if you are looking for a new guild

Really!?  Which setting do I choose to avoid hearing everyone's kids?
---
its a classic
---
Its such a massive advantage, in fact. That in real vanilla, the entirety of the alliance rerolled to Horde. Thats why on live today, you see horde guilds dominating the world first race.
---
Its just math, man.
---
Unless this was a common question and reaction, I believe we have been on the same realm at the same time when the bow question popped up :-)

Nothing more rage inducing than to listen to someone crunch ice right into their mic. haha

It’s an RPPVP server for one. All 3 of those names will be flagged to be changed

I have bad news for you, almost every "competitive" private server guild is EU.

Maybe it’s cause we had shaman but we had like 9-10. We did use 3 druids but 1 was feral.

I know what you mean, but things only scale up, not down. So that Duskwood wolf would still one shot you.
---
Like that will have an impact at all lmao
---
Gnome rogues LOLOL
---
It's too bad that not only do alliance look better for pve and horde look better for a typical pvp player, but they play better for their respective roles as well.  What if you kept the design of each faction but swapped all the racials around.  I think things would be a lot more balanced.
---
Im so ready to play this game i cant wait...
---
But I see no reason to sub early for a name, i can make a name on launch day
---
Faerlina and Grobbulus are the two most balanced servers according to the census. Going Horde or Alliance on either one are both good choices.
---
Herod is horde dominated. If that's your thing go there.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/FR83sNq.png) is my list of what I was testing with during the stress test. I feel it's pretty much good to go. Maybe a few extra things such as a chat addon and stuff for BGs and raiding. I've used bartender on retail, but I couldn't get it to behave, so I may swap out Dominos later.
---
What does that have to do with the joke?
---
I just named my Tauren Warrior Heresthebeef lol
---
anything before max level has been meaningless since like WOTLK anyway. Just the way wow has gone. There has been some early quest chains but nothing matters before you hit the expansion cap.

Aside from lack of taunts, a lot of specializations could be more viable simply by having gear that is tailored for them. If they ever go Classic+ I think that is the main way to go and if they don't want to change or add additional skills/abilities, they could even make a trinket that has active taunt.
---
Speaking as a Dane - it's neat to play with one or two other Danes in an English Guild, but in my experience - All-Danish Guilds are the worst you can get. I will never join a Danish Guild again in my life if I can avoid it at all.
---
Got a link? Last I heard, Ooga gang was never public about anything.
---
See you on the 26th!
---
 &gt;They wish him the worst
---
They literally just want him, like every streamer, to not play on herod. Asmon takes it personally and then acts like a dumbass, and that results in people treating him like a dumbass because he's being a dumbass, and the cycle continues. 
---
I say this as a frequent viewer of him and fan. He literally cannot let it go or see the bigger picture beyond "people are saying mean things about me right now in this moment, and i'm doing nothing wrong in this singular moment, so they must be assholes, so i'm going to go out and actively try to ruin their servers"
---
After reading through the comments on here, it sounds like a better solution to the broad scaling as it is now would be to have each zone include a gradual scale of mobs.  Some easy, some the same level as the player, and some a bit higher level appropriate to the quest progression in the zone.  It would at least give the player the opportunity to be challenged and add a sense of danger to the different areas of the zones.  It still wouldn't fully solve the problem without an overhaul of the whole world, but it might make it a bit more interesting.
---
It's the same thing with transmog. The only person who cares what you look like is you. At the most some guy passes by and thinks you look cool for 3/4th of a second.
---
You aren't going to miss out on social interactions. 90% of the time, you'd just walk past the guy you're claiming you'd interact with, plus it's not like you're in a layer alone, so stop whining and just live with it for the short term.
---
There was a detailed explanation in another thread about why this is going to be incredibly hard and time intensive to fix.
---
I don't know if it's true, but then I could understand why it's not fixed yet.
---
Eh I got my name Firetotem. I’m happy.
---
I was 14 when it came out. I told my mom it was just a one time fee. Luckily she didn't check her bank account to closely so it worked out.

Incidentally my proudest accomplishment from wotlk was killing a lvl 80 lock that tried to gank my lvl 72 DK.

Oh! Right damn, I'm dumb! Ok I thought it was a typo and He/She meant she "came on to him" and I was like WTF that's so strange, ok that makes a lot more sense!           
---
Uh that's rough, I myself have a gay daughter and I don't want her to feel she needs to go through life hiding who she is, it's nothing to be ashamed about but as I tell her and her girlfriend it's also something personal and unless it comes up naturally I wouldn't announce it just because there are closed-minded people out there.                   
---
Again we don't have hardly any of the facts and details to this story, maybe the guild leader is a homophobe bigot or maybe he wasn't asking her sexual orientation and decided they were too full of drama for his guild, I've kicked several guildies in the past not because of who they are but because I could tell they were just trying to stir up drama.          
---
          
---
I guess good luck finding a guild who accepts you for who you are and keep the conversation game related.
---
I'm lost here. She didn't actually help you with your PVE vs PVP dilemma. She only helped to optimize your time spent playing.
---
Competitive as the US telco market.
---
&gt; That's not scaling.
---
Aight, I'll bite: What then, is scaling? Because "scaling" means that the mobs always *scale* to your level: Sure, you can also call it "wherever you go, there they are", but however you call it: It takes the feeling of progression out of the game, because it removes a dependable framework upon which the world operates away, and instead makes everything scale around the player: The world is no longer the scale the players moves through, the player *becomes* the scale that everything else revolves around.
---
I was on holiday in USA and one guy was mean to me. American people sucks!
---
It’s not a legitimate vanilla experience if people can switch layers to avoid world PvP. It’s not. It’s game breaking. This is turning into the Diet Coke of WoW and only fatty diabetics who can’t drink real Coke are trying to convince others Diet Coke is basically the same thing. It most certainly isn’t.

Only if he gets reported a couple times, then they'll look and be like "o ya nope nope"
---
yes but in BC and Wrath you weren't specifically capped daily on earning rep for factions if you wanted to put in the extra grind you could. Retail now, there is NOTHING you can do to earn more rep outside of quests, world quests and maybe some other obscure activity.
---
He might say your name on stream too!
---
Sounds like your guild just found its new main tank 👍
---
I hope they all stream snipe one another and blacklist themselves.
---
This is peer pressure, who cares how a screen shot is taken.
---
Both should be kicked then
---
To kill pretty people like you.
---
Never played WoW after WOTLK so obviously I won't criticize retail since I don't know what's up.
---
But I played many other modern-day MMORPGs and they all incur in the same errors: none creates a society like classic WoW does, mostly because classes are so weak by their own but strong when grouped (Because other classes cover your weaknesses and boost your strengths) plus how massive elite quests / dungeon runs are, you're just prone to team up and add and legitimately talk to people you enjoyed playing with.
---
It's crazy. I played modern day MMORPG's, in few months I made like a handful of mates. I played WoW stress test and you're just talking to people for whichever reason and many of them stick out and you befriend them: 
---
"Group to kill this quest mob?" 
---
"These mobs are a bit higher level than me, group up with someone so it's less punishing?"
---
"Oh man, I am a warrior and I would WRECK those guys if I could just have that sheep and frost nova dispelled right away..."

So where is the lone chair in Darn? Is it Tyrande's throne or something?

Oh no no no

Did you guild clear Naxx?

Nice, my shaman is DianneYeast.
---
I'm not actually pushing for this change as much as I want to just hear other people's ideas. This subreddit just loves to get upset at nothing lol
---
Bottoms up... and the Devil laughs
---
I feel like after streamer announcements and such the results would be more than marginally different.
---
Wow.
---
You’d think there would have been some system in place for that.
---
I see the merit in it but also your story is complete shenanigans. How can you do that to your MT? It’s clearly not for everyone’s benefit either.
---
Thanks for explaining.
---
Way moreso than expected tbh. Lol
---
World First Ragefire Chasm coming.
---
So you get to 120 poor as fuck.
---
Can you really switch layers manually?
---
Very yes case closed
---
What custom changes to gameplay are we getting?
---
Without getting into specifics of peoples personal setup. Open mic is fine among close friends. Doing anything with random people, push to talk is generally best.

I have kids and am in Grad school, so I feel compelled to maximize my questing time.

yikes. Stop replying to him, folks. he doesn't have sex
---
We never stopped using Mumble. Lowest latency VOIP master race.
---
I remember the days you could search my name from 2004 to about Cata and I'd be the only hit. Then I did arenas with a growing streamer and we were queuing rank 1 3v3 games. Tldr: there's like a hundred people with my name now. 
---
It's pretty cool, but also pretty lame at the same time.
---
Anyone who played in Tich and wasn't an e-celeb fanboy re-rolled on to another server once it became twitch central. Killed real server culture.
---
Made me lol have an upvote! I managed to snag hamburglar for my Tauren shammy
---
yeah, as just kinda playing with ya. apart from that no, nothing. was kind of one of those 'why is he even asking this' things.  
---
essentially... if you don't care about racials, then race really doesn't matter
---
&gt;Why did they add another server? they could have made an educated guess about how many servers they needed. 
---
You don't see how an oversight like that would happen? Calculate how many servers are needed based on the number of players without taking into account that there should be at least one each of pvp and pve servers because every other region has enough players that that's automatically taken care of?
---
&gt;Or maybe they just lack intellect like me.
---
Your words, not mine. I wholeheartedly agree about that view of you though.
---
Oh yikes. That explains so much. I had no idea this subreddit was full of Alex’s alt right incel fans. Thought you guys hated classic now?
---
If we ever meet I’ll have you on your knees staring at my pink stick.
---
Thats a good point. Id sub a day before though. to be able to make your main and alts. so you can log in the second it goes live and also mess around with the creation process without any chance of disconnects etc.
---
Didn't say I didn't want classic, ya bish...l2read ya weeny.
---
Thank you, seven year old me
---

You are for-gotten.
---
Looks like a dwarf.
---
honestly needs a beard but i'll let it pass.
---
Prat, EKminimap (w/o quest log change), TitanBar, CTMailMod or Postal... still debating an actionbar or unit frames mod. I actually rather like the stock gryphons and stuff.
---
Don't forget a quick dismount mod.
---
Definitely ran the pre raid dungeons with paladin tanks. Not everyone cares about raids
---
You can do your examples in retail though
---
The batch priority is lessened compared to what it is in retail currently. Because of this there are more likely scenarios of 2mages polymorphing each other at the same time. However, if your ping was a lot shittier than someone else's it's possible for you to have put in your spell at the fraction of time slower than they had which means you may or may not be in the same batch window. If this happened it could cause you to feel robbed, for instance as a rogue interrupting a cast. So to me it only makes sense to mitigate this possibility as much as possible, hence why the 15ms ping is more advantageous opposed to 80 as a minimum. Ping is mostly stable but you never know, your bandwidth and activity on your internet can cause it to fluctuate and I would hate to start at 80 and have it spike higher and shit the bed.

Confirmed very yes
---
Yeah we're happy that we got kicked now not like after months of playing. Still hurts and is really disapointing.
---
I don't think there will be a queue.
---
SOOO FUNNY! HAHA
---
I miss that god awful static beep when you pressed your mic button.
---
Yes! The early game is very straight forward. Just follow the quests and grind mobs in between. Asking around to other players or doing a bit of googling if you get lost can be a big help as well.
---
Doubtful, but I appreciate the attempt. Fairbanks?

&gt;Aight, I'll bite:

---
I mean, yeah, you're the one endlessly ranting about how much you hate layering while refusing to acknowledge basic facts. Again, please, go play on private servers. People like that are plentiful in those communities, you'll fit right in.
---
Ive played on several vanilla realms for that real experience and I now want something new to experience.
---
It had a very strong EQ base, I think they even called Tink's avatar a ranger at one point.  Felicity day's costume is much more Firiona Vie than anything in WoW.
---
In the music video they refer to tank and spank, which was more widely used in EQ (mainly because wow has HORRIBLE cc options) to refer to a fight that didnt require CC to be done.
---
Also the warrior spamming in the music video sounds like someone in commons.
---
Maybe i just lean more heavily to EQ and so I read that into the show.
---
To state they lean towards WOW is easy, the indian guy plays a warlock and eq had necro's not warlocks.  So who knows..
---
Rouge for all the epic whisper rants you'll get.
---
&gt; No, because at a drop of a hat he can have thousands of people report you for nothing or cc you.
---
Why would he do that?  Who has he done this to on retail WoW?
---
Any proof about what I am asking?  Are you just assuming with no information or source to go on?
---
Being a sexist asshole is different from not getting laid
---
I really don't want to bum you out but Enhancement's damage is just really weak. You might get a guild as a Nightfall bot. (Nightfall is an axe with a really good chance on hit which boosts caster dps). 
---
Technically possible? Yes. 
---
Your leverage is that guilds always need shamans.
---
Will you be asked to heal even though you got accepted as Enhancement? Yes.
---
As Resto you could get into good guilds with shit gear.
---
You sound like a guy who got their name
---
Didn't read it. Formed my opinion by the title
---
The CD on escape artist is 1 min so it's essentially a 1 time use depending on the fight. So after you use it, are you essentially in the same situation as a Human would be?
---
Pretty meh over all, except that Dalaran university t-shirt.
---
I need me one of those. But I'm EU so I have to wait I guess...
---
I haven't played retail in years, I wouldn't even know if people still do this. 
---
What I do know is that idleing in cities was never bigger than in Vanilla in other expansions (atleast up til Cata which is where I quit).
---
In phase 1 most will still be leveling and gearing, in phase 2 the server will be at its most lively point and in phase 3 people start idleing because they're either waiting for their bg to pop or are waiting 5-7 days for mc/bwl/ony to reset. 
---
If you really believe idleing isn't a thing then you clearly weren't around back in Vanilla and you're in for a rude awakening. Or perhaps you just enjoy running brd for the 200th time to get that Ironfoe to drop...
---
Almost seems like Blizzard would be better off just restricting the name off the bat instead of letting some angry hunter that lost a roll on something report him out of anger. He is also playing a Rogue on a PvP server so there is no way he doesn't piss off a couple people. LOL
---
Where are you sourcing this information from?  Right now I play on a central time server that is located in LA.
---
Similar to my warrior's name. Dwarf named Axcellent

Were you a female human priest? That name does sound familiar.

In protest of classic wow being streamable and having sharding im 5 boxing. Classic is not classic so why would i lie to myself that it is classic.
---
its 15 years of people playing vanilla wow tho, both legitimately and on pservers ...
---
Check the imgur link, there's a photo of it there, next to some Argent Dawn emissaries
---
Yes, feeling very obsessive... checked on them about 20 times since I made them just to staaaaaaare, imagine playing them, stare at their names and imagine how cool they’ll look on top of my characters, stare at the ugly gnome placeholders I have right now, and practice speed creating my characters in the creation menu... kicked from the menu for inactivity, then repeat.
---
Well I’m thinking day one or fresh character. Lvl 14 is when you get the first quest for a wand I think. Before then, you’d have to spend time crafting, disenchanting and then making your wand. A fresh character likely won’t have the resources to trade/buy for a low lvl wand until they’ve almost out lvld it.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
Yeah honestly it really is hard for me to find the line between positive spec balancing and negative spec balancing. But it's something I always am battling myself over. No changes is definitely the way to go but in the future I could see them trying to do a changes version of vanilla.
---
&gt; As a casual player i distinctly remember doing MC in one evening with a raid full of people still using at least 50% blues without any consumables of note.
---
No consumables of note is not the same thing as no consumables. This is what I'm talking about when I say "invisible work." As a healer class lead during Vanilla, it was part of my job to make sure that we had enough things like mana potions to bring to every raid. We'd usually try to budget for about 100 to 120 every raid. More as things got harder.
---
Again, some guilds will decide that they don't want to provide those consumables. But that just pushes the need to get those consumables onto the specs which have the hardest time farming them up by themselves. 
---
A lot of players didn't realize that this stuff happened every week. Many still don't. But that's the reality of trying to organize big raids. 
---
Like I said at the start: there's always some section of people who find the game turning into a job. Everyone who's part of a guild should by trying to shoulder some of that load. And that means you're going to wind up spending some time every week farming.
---

---
The only real risk is if one account gets banned your other account could get banned as well.
---
I know a dude who got banned because his Dad got caught botting on a different account.
---
Impossible to say beforehand. Could be a few minutes, could be hours. In theory, the layers should keep the queues down. On the other hand, my record is a 12.5h queue at launch of an expansion. Queues like that are unlikely with the layering, but you never know what Blizzard is up to!
---
I'll play devil's advocate just for the sake of conversation. I would argue that Classic not only was not a perfect class balance but in itself was CONSTANTLY every changing throughout its inception, 1.12 wasn't the best they could do, it just happened to be the furthest they got to class balancing when Vanilla ended. Class balance from 1.0-1.12 was always in constant change so to claim it wasn't already a never-ending cycle is a bit disingenuous.            
---
             
---
Now onto your other point which is what I see get brought up the most, it doesnt affect the enjoyment of the game, I say it does. The reason everyone loves Vanilla was the social aspect of the game and sure even with the Classes being so unbalanced people still see Vanilla as the peak in WoW.               
---
I dont think Class Balance changed that, I think antisocial mechanics changed that. Dungeon Finder and teleporting to dungeons. LFR and toned down free easy loot. Cross server BGs and playing with randoms. Those are why people normally hate Retail because those mechanics ruined the social aspect of WoW.                  
---
I dont think Blizzard saying "Hey were gonna give Boomkin form +35 Mana per sec and Prot Palidans a taunt" automatically equals "Oh and because we did this small class change, here's LFD, LFR, Cash Shop and Flying mounts, sorry we absolutely had to do that as well."
---
I think it's fine, especially since the accent is further back in the name (so a /who torbj would pull you up). Of course, if you're whispering people for invites, they can just right click/shift click ya and it's no big deal.
---
The fact that you sexualizing this game and flipping out that people dont care about your sexuality is pathetic. If the substance of your character (as on you, the person) is so centralized on your sexuality it says a lot about your character in general.
---
Inb4banned because I dont want you to sexualize my community
---
To know how many chairs there are, clearly.
---
Yup xD
---
We need the entertainment until release.
---
what's the deal with that cat?
---
yeah nothings really 'game-breaking'  
---
some racials can definitely be fight winning though  
---
maybe you break out of that nova, get ur charge off and win the wpvp fight. vs the alternative worst case. They win that 1 battle... but now they are camping you on full health as you try and res @ half.  
---
in most cases you just lose the fight and move on with your life. but sometimes it could lead to you being pushed out of your farming spot.  
---
not saying go gnome, im going human myself, just making sure ya worked thru it all as your focus seems to be pvp. dwarves stoneform will essentially guarantee you a free win vs rogues, but doesnt help you against a bunch of classes. so again not 'game-breaking' so to say. humans at least get our don julio's av ring faster ... heh.
---
My friends all decided to go Herod at 8 post last night, not looking forward to that servers launch.
---
The only viewers a new streamer on Herod will have would be gankers looking to kill them

it doesn't ilvl stuff really didn't start until late wrath with the gearscore addon and metric that everyone started using for pugs

I think even TSM Akaadian will play there.

From a quick profile search it appears your MtF. I don’t want to sound insensitive, but I’m certain you must’ve faced more scrutiny in your life than being kicked out of a WoW guild. 
---
Buck up, Bart.
---
Orc racial and Execute! What could be better? Axcellent is amazing.
---
no offence but holy shit ur dumb
---
Whew... that's a good question. Right now, I don't have a main per se because I don't raid. In Vanilla, I mained a gnome mage.  
---
I'm probably going to main a human rogue because I *really* miss combat spec.
---
Waaaaaaah you're not posting a picture how I want. Waaaaaaah.
---
not a fact. Blizzard has said they're listening and there's a chance they listen to us. 
---
It's so weird that people like you want to exclude those who think different. Not just ignore us or insult us but you want us to go away. Like, if I'm wrong then what are you worried about? Just enjoy your layered game
---
Yes but then you could also be a healpaladin and equip that axe, couldn't you?

This is why I visit /new

Can we take a moment to appreciate they didn't just import the cancer name filter from retail that considers just about everything offensive?
---
I figured this was going to be the truth of it.  All of the classic realms would have their data centers in LA.  I guess we don't know if all of them are, but so far the three you looked at are there.  
---
It probably makes only the smallest difference with the server batching at 400 ms.  It is like everyone has 400ms ping server side anyway.  Just a few players on the west coast might hit the batch priority before your east coast spell gets there from your living room.

I see goblins as gnomes for horde and worgens are equal belves (best race in the game after pandarens)

I get your grabbing feline swiftness Asap, I just cant help but feel its a mistake not to get natural weapons first and omen. Your gonna be level 38 before you have them. Although having feline swift at level 21 is very tempting. I might go that path, but 10% dps plus free heal is something I'd miss for 14 levels.

Ret probably has a better chance of getting into a raid than a prot paladin. :(

Literal truth: Long ago before WoW was public, an item was made by a programmer to help debug things.  It was a *plate* shirt with an activate ability that kills everyone around you. It had an ID of 17 in the db.  Sometime during Wrath of the Lich King, A GM had to manually restore an item with the id 170.  Except the person typing it in fat fingered the 0 and thus sent the ID 17 item instead.   Giving that player the ability to kill gods.  
---
[No really, it happened, and the player was banned for cheating behavior after his guild clearned several raid instances using it.](https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/25/wow-archivist-the-martin-fury-incident-friday/)  
---
[And the item was nerfed so that it couldn't happen again if it was accidentally fat fingered away again, or if someone had it as a trophy and didn't abuse it](https://www.wowhead.com/item=17/martin-fury)
---
Sounds like a lack of communication between bottom and top of those guilds. If you don't know exactly what you're signing up for then there is a problem somewhere in the line of communication. Either someone didn't know how casual or they were just dense joining a guild they knew you were "better" than.
---
Lot's of casual guilds are not like oh inviting x will make it harder, they are inviting x will make the guild more fun. That's all they care about is the fun and get it how they want. Not everyone cares about killing a boss fast and they will be together having a good time anyway.

NO. I've seen some unironic talk about people redownloading vent. It would go hand in hand because they are both 15 years old with zero updates, but hell no. Vent is so bad.

Let's not even joke about it.

Read the text. I brought it up because of our voices, and because it might stir some drama because of this. I wanted to bring it up to the guild leader proactively, just in case something like that might happen.
---
And I too thought that is has nothing to with the game, but both my gf and I got banned for it, so apparently it does matter to some guilds unfortunately.
---
There are now 2 separate posts about this in an hour. You seem like you have A LOT of drama that I would want to avoid at all costs.  This coming from someone who is also searching for an LGB guild.
---
Where are you seeing that info?
---
Didn't really get the names I wanted
---
Main mage character: Acary

Yeah, you're definitely not a boomer. I'm 35 and I'm a millennial, my parents are boomers.
---
Anyone know how to save your interface options?  I did the WTF folder trick but I noticed none of the interface options carried over.
---
Oh shut the fuck up.
---
Peon is straight fire for a bank alt. I'm very impressed.
---
As someone who hasn't ever played horde and is stuck playing alliance again because my all my friends want to - horde just seems more interesting
---
2019...
---
&gt; I was spitting on people on the stress test outside Org as a human mage to provoke PvP
---
That's all good in the hood for PvP because how else are we going to communicate cross faction? Spitting on your own guys because they bought a mount Asmondgold didn't have? C'mon. He litterally says in his streams he's going to ruin the game. It's whatever if you wanna whiteknight for him go for it.
---
So -7.5k dps?
---
No, if you open your resource monitor that shows all of your network connections that are currently active, you can find the server address for any of wow's servers/realms. Just look for the IP address that is connected to port 3724, and you can even do this while you are in the game, not just sitting at the character selection screen. You can also see from the data center list for Chicago and Irvine that there are a lot of current live retail realms that are east coast time zones but actually physically located in Irvine, CA. So just because Blizzard says a realm is a certain timezone does not mean the server is located anywhere near that timezone. It is a sad truth unfortunately. Blizzard lies worse than a cheap rug.
---
You too mate have a great classic experience. The hype is real!
---
No I'm not :(

Last 2 weeks I’ve been running MC/BWL, and levelling professions, just to get a feel for how much time I’m going to have to devote to mining/bs 300.
---
This shit is on fire
---
At this point levels are totally pointless.
---
Okay wtf.. each his own i guess but i really dont agree. Orcs, Undeads, Humans, dwarfs are all better racers by far imo.
---
or the fact you dont need 40 people to clear the raids. You can do it with 35-36.

---
Addons are a fun way to individualize your experience a bit more but never absolutely needed.
---
Why not go on Fairbanks or whitemane
---
Buy a few cases of MRE's.  They will fill you up, and plug you up.  Less pooping is good!
---
LOL, imagine playing Horde in classic. No elves, no paladins, no chairs. 
---
&lt;Laughs in Alliance&gt;
---
This isn't retail.
---
Dumbass.
---
Classic is not even close to the same requirements as 2004 WoW.
---
I was getting locked  60fps max settings on vanilla private servers in orgrimmar (on my work laptop)
---
Classic stress test when I tried turning settings to max I was literally getting 9FPS in an empty area.
---
It only takes into account people logged on at the time.  It will show low the day or two before launch for EVERY server if everyone has their names reserved and doesn’t log in just to sit around.
---
/r/fakehistoryporn
---
Main NI guild is on swolemagg, not RPing Irish Independence on fucking Zandalar
---
Faerlina and Harod will be bonkers (10k+) and every other server will have no queue, probably
---
I almost always pick the 2nd or 3rd largest of the PvP servers when new realms roll out. Whitemane seems like the logical choice for me. That's what I did and also coincidentally everyone I use to play Vanilla WoW with I just reconnected with had the same thought process.
---
I think it's going to be a solid server.
---
Yesterday was an unmitigated shitshow.
---
I'll never forget when I was like, level 18 or so on my Human Paladin, just exploring. I had been questing in Darkshore and decided "Wow, Azshara sounds like a cool zone, I wonder how to get there!"
---
So I went north, as far north as I could and ended up jumping off into the water in northern Darkshore, and spent about 30 minutes or so swimming east, then south, and eventually finding my way to land in Azshara. I was repeatedly buttfucked by the ?? Level mobs that would aggro from days away. It was incredible. 
---
I asked for help in /1 and people were like "Wtf are you doing here?" and eventually escorted me to the west towards Ashenvale. It was awesome. I created an Escort Quest starring myself, the stupid paladin who had no idea what he was doing.
---
When it happens at launch layers will be slowly kicking in and help speed up the process.
---
Herod is gonna be booming cause streamers are going Faerlina and Brazilians are going Thalnos. So it's viewed as the only option for EST PvP players that want to avoid those two groups.
---
I made 3 characters. All named Buttholio.
---
To be fair, level scaling wasn’t added to create artificial difficulty.
---
1) Prior to the intro of scaling, blizz revamped the Xp requirements several times. Generally once per xpac.
---
2) All of the old world content in retail was built for Cata. So the xp given by quests and per zone was set then. 
---
3) In addition, Cata revamped all of the questing process. Each zone basically had a long linear quest chain and storyline. You could not skip sections in most cases outside of option side quests. 
---
4) After the xp revamps of MoP and WoD, leveling in EK/Kalimdor became very odd, even without heirlooms you’d out level a zone maybe 30% of the way through the zones quest line. 
---
I should note that heirlooms exacerbated the above, as did any XP you got from dungeons while mid-questline. It was pretty normal to start the quest chain of a zone, do maybe 10 quests, have a queue pop, and then, bam, by the time you’re out of the dungeon, you’ve outleveled that zone. 
---
So, it wasn’t added for artificial difficulty. It was added so players would have motivation and reasoning outside of lore, to finish the quest chains and story lines in entire zones, while leveling. 
---
To be fair, since it’s introduction I have new appreciation for the TBC quest content. When they added scaling to Outland I finally had a reason to do the Netherstorm quest line for the first time since TBC, for example. It’s good content. It’s nice that it’s a viable way to level from 67-75 or so.  
---
So, with all due respect, it wasn’t added to create artificial difficulty, it was really added to make abandoned quest content relevant again. Which I can’t really argue with since for me it’s factually improved the experience of leveling new toons in retail. 
---
Now. I don’t agree the changes that mandated it. Blizz should have been less clumsy with xp changes. But that’s another argument.
---
exCUSE me but Myzzie is not 'some random mob'. She is an Earth Elemental Princess that only got a little bit corrupted and is part of one of the most memorable quest chains in Classic!
---
Yeah, Atiesh is pretty cool too :)
---
Atleast it's better than the dogshit discord servers
---
not true. Your opinions are not facts
---
You're gonna wear armor and it literally won't matter?
---
Ignore energy drinks from today until launch, lower your tolerance to caffeine.
---
Drink energy drinks wisely during launch.
---
Prepare food in groups according to length of time it takes to prepare/eat. Instant snacks near you, you can grab like nutrigrain bars, muffins or cookies. Quick food that is already prepared in the fridge like sandwiches or hard boiled eggs. Slow foods still prepared but need to be heated up or steps to get ready like chili, spaghetti sauce, or cereal.
---
Another over the top tip. Blanket up all windows and close out all sunlight. Only use artificial light to trick the brain. And also never look at the clock.
---
Why the hell would you make a list like this in paint?
---
Hey everyone, do we have a list of server specific subreddits yet?
---
Retard
---
Good guilds fill raids. Its the mediocre ones
---
Also, even if you fill a raid, it doesn't make sense to give gear to the Ret Paladin until your Warriors are fully geared.
---
It shouldn't be either since the beta is over, it should just be classic. Pretty weird that your account isn't eligible for it since everyone with a subscription is. Hope blizzard can help you
---
Doethn’t matter...
---
I mean, it's easy to say that it's "just that easy", but it again comes down to trust. If you can trust your players to know their BiS and all that, then go for it.  
---
What happens when someone says it BiS and another person says that it's not for them? Do you step in an disallow them? Same situation as the example I gave. Someone is going to get butthurt, or some people won't know BiS, or wrongfully assume.  
---
If your WoW experience is more about dolling out points and policing your raiders to know if they are "bidding properly", then I'd say you're the one making it hard. Much much harder and more stressful.  
---
Honestly, it's not hard. People say and do dumb stuff and make it hard.
---
Dude I agree with this 100%. The fact that OP is trans shouldn’t be brought up unless OP brings it up.
---
You’re obviously welcome to share your life with whoever you choose but maybe in the game be less forthcoming with people. It’s clearly not a perfect world, but people can’t discriminate you if they don’t know things about you. I don’t share any personal shit with anyone on WoW. It’s irrelevant what I do with my pieces of meat and who I do them with. Judge people on which faction they choose, like those dirty alliance bastards.
---
And deleted in 3 minutes get rekted
---
Super cool PM sent ;)
---
PvP him!
---
Oh no! A tragedy
---
Yeh, how I feel as well. It's evident how a rot has set in modern games, when Vanilla really brings back colors again. Who would've thought that it wasn't me getting tired of games, it was modern games getting tired of gamers.
---
Sucks to be European lol
---
Honestly they'll prolly run better after being splashed with water
---
Should've made him black.
---
That’s the difference between streamers. Who’s chasing content, and who’s chasing passionate gameplay.
---
Looking for a server home. This just chose it for me. You wont have my sword or axe, but will have my bow and piggy.
---
Its simple. Ret paladins are lowest priority for gear. 
---
Other classes will use it much more effectively.
---
That's just you getting used more to English than your mother tongue. English isn't more expressive than any other language.
---
lol.. A server is never "full" you can keep creating chars all you want on there, there is just a good chance you will sit in que to log in. Ive played on a "full" server most of my time playing wow.
---
Any time before launch afaik
---
I remember in Burning Crusade you took my friend and I on a tour of Orgrimmar to show us all of the chairs, only to reveal that the final chair was you all along. Still a very fond memory of my time in WoW.
---
Leveling lost all meaning for me the moment you could just pay for a boost. It makes it feel just meaningless to me. If they removed boosts, that alone would make leveling feel more rewarding imo. 60$ or whatever is nothing to me so why would I ever level manually, even if they experience was amazing? 
---
As a player that min maxes, you would realize that working an hour or two of overtime at your job would be the most efficient way to level. It's so fucking stupid and I hate it! =/
---
Scaling is crap. Scaling is what makes any potentially decent MMO absolute crap. What incentive is there to travel the world when you can just level wherever?
---
I grind to max level in ESO in about 6 hours with boosts because I can do 100% of my leveling in the same spot. Apply enough XP boosts that you can buy with real money or in-game gold and BAM you've got a speed leveling session going.
---
Honestly, I hate that.
---
I can have a max level character in ESO in no-time flat and when I look at my world map I have like 2 locations scouted out because I don't actually travel the globe.
---
Classic WoW forces you to set your hearthstone to many a different inn along the way. The journey is so much part of the fun and the adventure. You walk through a zone and think to yourself "ah the adventures I had in this place". You look at a tree and think "I remember seeing an opposite faction rogue 1 level higher than me over there and the ensuing back and forth battle that lasted 45 minutes and it was great"
---
Yes it takes longer, but that's the point.
---
Can't wait for classic

He is showing the rocks/minerals on his desk to imply that he actually is a geologist.

---
I got Legendaîry cuz the arrow shows power.
---
&gt; Why they change it, to me, sounds like hypothesizing on the thought processes and or feelings of other people, something I've always viewed as a waste of mental energy.
---
I wouldn't agree with you because the reason for their actions can make or break the entire meaning or purpose behind a change.
---
If you play League of legends you would know that there is a fine line between balancing for pro (competitive scene) play and ranked solo queue play. That one change that nerfs a champion who has a sub par win / play rate in general is aimed at the professional play and therefore is an acceptable change because a small playerbase (the pros) are abusing parts of his kit you can't do in solo queue play.
---
ie.) Tahm Kench.
---
I'm the opposite! I got a great name on Herod, but now I'm getting FOMO about if I should choose a low-key server instead, because I'm more low-key myself.
---
I deleted a character and made another earlier today. Not sure if the window will ever close.

Yup! And we all do it here on the forums! It really sucks that people will blow everything out of proportion or get mad at people opinions on here when in reality we’re all just sharing speculation and opinions.

Someone in the Herod discord has "Ally" if you want to check that out.
---
Well I managed to get the name of a cool stone, an obscure fantasy character, and the evil AI from Code Lyoko, so score I guess?
---
Cheers!  I have Nine in Thalnos.
---
Now that's fucking cool art &lt;3
---
When I signed in for the first time since MoP on my Death Knight, she didn't have a helmet. I suspect they removed some of the gear, and didn't replace it with anything.
---
And mal'ganis turned into a pretty horde heavy server iirc?  
---
That's exactly what I'm hoping doesn't happen, especially with only a few servers.
---
"Authentic" lol
---
Herod is unfortunately probably gonna be the least authentic PvP server.
---
Whitemane and Fairbanks should be great though.
---
The other PVP servers are overpopulated and contain all the toxic pserver guilds. Like you said RP-PVP is just PVP anyway so why wouldn't you pick it?
---
I hope no servers are spewing that shit honestly. I went Fairbanks but rolled specifically because I'm from Alaska.
---
The winner for least shit storming so far appears to be Whitemane. God bless their little hearts.
---
That name is unavailable.
---
there aint no such thing as a casual server. every server will have thousands of people as casual as you
---
Good question.  What does the theory crafting look like?
---
Too bad he enjoys money more than he enjoys leveling.
---
I am thinking about switching from Herod to Whitemane. Herod seems like it's going to be super packed and a lot of fun but a lot of over-serious hardcore gamers who have a lot of time and dedication
---
I got TB after editing a comment asking for it in Herod!
---
I think wrath peaked because most of the lore players wanted to see Arthas.

You will hear my burps and you will enjoy it

This settles it Alliance&gt;Horde
---
The Dad server, if you will.
---
How long does this take roughly?
---
I def don't want to wreck someone and then have them Google me and bash me on Reddit lmao
---
The post title does take me back to barrens chat.
---
&gt; but i don't wanna roll a warrior just because it's the best at everything but healing! 
---
Thats an exaggeration. Mages, Rogues, Warlocks and Hunters all bring decent damage. Even shadow priests are worth a slot or two. Even if Warriors do better theoretical damage, a 30 warrior raid is going to be starving on gear.
---
Its really just Paladins, Druids and Shamans who do bad damage.
---
No. Layers have a limit. They specifically said they would use queues if necessary.
---
Thunderbluff wouldn't have normal sized chairs though, so having benches makes sense.   
---
This is a racist assumption on taruens.
---
10x better if you had chair counts from original vanilla
---
I would recommend as fallback, looking for those guilds with 'older' people in them (I'm married with children, in my 40s). These guilds advertise they have some free time to play but can't be too serious and want to be around mature players when they can. The "Dad Guilds" may be your best bet. These are less likely to have immature poop-socking under 30 kids.
---
If you're into hardcore raiding and investing a lot of time, there likely are some semi-hardcore guilds with older, more mature crowd as well. I recall seeing these advertised in the flood of recruitment channels =)
---
Now try doing that in Hc/mythic raids. The difficulty in retail isn't in leveling...
---
Layers have a limit. They specifically said they would use queues if necessary.
---
Okay I'll meet you in the cafeteria after 3rd period
---
It seems like a pretty good server. The discord is a little meme-ee. Seems to be more populated and well balanced than the other west coast server.
---
Can't tell if troll post or genuine ass eating queen
---
&gt; content wasn't invalidated every 3 months thanks to the latest catchup patch.  
---
To me this is one of the main reasons I am excited about vanilla, nothing will feel pointless because the next patch won't just invalidate everything I just did. It will just be one big journey from level 1 to clearing Naxx.
---
Why not make an extra bank/AH character then?

---
solid choice then with human  
---
sadly, for ally warrs at least, they dont have 1 class with top end pvp and top end pve racial. so have to choose 1 racial type to go after.  
---
wanted to go horde for the pvp racials myself. friends didnt. after messing around on pservers and getting to rank 9 on a human i realized i hardly ever got feared. really didnt feel like i missed wotf all too much, pvp trinket was up most the time(even at vanilla 5 min cd). All that, fwiw, helped solidfy my choice of orc if i end up having to go horde for w/e reason.
---
Non-scaling generally works for vanilla, but with EXP changes in later expansions it didn't.  The level cap kept getting raised and they kept having to increase the leveling speed, so without scaling questing in Desolace might get you to 35-45 in vanilla but on retail half the quests would get you to 35-45.  It annoyed players who felt like they had to move to the next zone to keep gaining exp but wanted to finish their quests.
---
It's not a 1 to 1 comparison where scaling is just flat out bad, the ecosystem and context matters.  Personally I like the that item rewards and quest exp scale with your level.
---
Grab your dick and double click

Yep. He isn't contradicting himself. Looks like he just added on to his comment through a second comment instead of an edit

Looks like me and my buddy are going Warrior(arms) and rogue. Sounds fun!
---
Hear me out on this one bro....  there are 32 special characters available for naming in WoW (that I could find).  Combine that with 26 regular letters and you get 58 “letters” per slot in a name. Last I checked names could be 12 characters long. So to figure out how many 12 character names are possible with 58 letters you do
---
58!/12!  Which is 4.9x10^69. Or 49 followed by 68 zeros. 
---
And I think that just counts names that are 12 characters long, you would need to add the names that are 11, 10, 9...  all the way down to two characters. You would also need to take out the names that Blizz doesn’t allow.  I am reaching decades back to college for this math, so if someone knows better than me, definitely chime in. 
---
Lastly think about this, if they open a single new server, it adds that many possibilities all over again....
---
I can’t wait for classic, it will be a much better use of my time!
---
what? doesn't layering fix that?
---
Well,
---
There are almost 1 x 10^17 (that is 100 Quadrillion or 100 Billiard depending on where you are from) names available if you take into account names must be between 2 and 12 characters long and only use regular letter from the alphabet.
---
If you allow the use of the 32 allowed accented letter (like è and ñ for instance) that number skyrockets tp 1,5 x 10^21 (Sextillion or Trilliard)
---
Im not taking out the names that ar unavailable (admin, player, spiderman etc), that use 3 or more of the same letter in a row (Illidannn, Rrrageboi etc), and some of the accented letter are capitals and can only be at the start, nevertheless, it's a lot of possible names.
---
I got Ansume on the PVPRP server. I'm still working out the character backstory but the last thing I remember is being whispered to by Aluneth about the end of the world. Suddenly here I am in coldridge valley, and have no idea how I got here or who my family is. I just keep hearing his voice telling me to harness the arcane...

 " Players cannot create a character on a Full realm unless they already have characters on that realm. Full realms are deemed 'full' by Blizzard and as such, their 'full' status does not fluctuate like a 'high' population realm's might.

Your ping will be through the roof... Wow can play on 56k modem... You will be fine... Enjoy most likely 2k latency....
---
Im kinda out of the loop why is herod so popular compared to other servers?
---
You obviously have zero grasp of software development.
---
Herod - hardcore east coast 
---
Whitemane - hardcore west coast
---
Faerlina - streamer server
---
Fairbanks - casual semi hardcore 
---
Thalnos - casual semi hardcore (unofficial foreign)
---
Obviously every server will have their share of hardcore casual and semi hardcore guilds. But this is what I believe just based of the name and what I’ve seen on discord / reddit
---
Times have changed aka MONEY PLEASEEE
---
Hence why they are in reverse....

I’m in the process of setting up the internet this week so I’m not sure yet.

That black gryphon though
---
Do you like being ganked by players 10lvls higher? Play PvP otherwise PvE.
---
Do it anyway
---
That is a good point, I hadn't really thought of the post release guilds.
---
To add, one flaw of DKP is that people can collude to underbid on items.
---
Like, maybe the warlocks all agree to take turns on their tier sets, then they use their DKP to outbid the mages on competing gear.
---
Grob &gt;
---
&gt; he really is like alpha male
---
He is a good example of peak sigma male. He just DGAF which people mistake being an asshole nowadays. His streamer act is near perfect, he is over playing his persona and the haters are eating it up his very high quality baits. 
---
People watch him because most of us doesn't have the courage to be ourselves, most people are so afraid being themselves they just shut off and project a completely different personality in their lives because they fear consequences and getting outcast socially. 
---
It's like watching Fight Club or Wolf of Wall street. You wish to be a better man and him speaking his mind and not giving a fuck provides just that.
---
precisely the people that do follow him that will make it to 60 are likely to not be completely problematic as players.
---
also having to manually switch to caster form to cast a heal.
---
Grobuulos needs Clorox.
---
Goosebumps on my arms man. Well fuckin done!
---
Some people get stoned, some get drunk, some do coke and then some do all of the above in some order.
---
Will you be leveling with your friend or is he going to be solo? If he's solo I'd recommend a hunter or warlock, having a pet to tank damage makes life wayyy easier.
---
Priest certainly wouldn't be a bad pick either! I don't know as much about priest, but they definitely fill the same general role. They have less situational utility, but stronger defensive utility. They have more powerful healing and lots of shield/armor increasing spells, versus the shamans totems which can do everything from restoring mana, to slowing enemies, to giving your allies a chance to multistrike.
---
They also both have a caster dps mode akin to playing a mage, and different but really good flavor for each. I'd say if priest seems more like what you want flavor/playstyle wise, do it!
---
You really can't go wrong either way, I was just giving a shoutout to shamans because they are often overlooked.
---
Before there was even a proper term!
---
More like **sitpost** amirite?

English server that is.
---
Except ret destroys shadow in dps, shadow is literally the worst hybrid you go holy weaving or no raid spot for you.
---
Well yea. Ragnaros, Onyxia, Nefarion, the lich king -- all issued caused or facilitated by the alliance through either greed or political corruption. Living in an overall more down to Azeroth lifestyle instead of in polished marble cities certainly wouldn't make a faction "the bad guys."
---
Uh, the removal of CC abilities is straight up for players who don't know how to PvP and their minimal understand of Diminishing returns.
---
I played wow on a 56k back in the day.  Sattelite wasn't much better.  You'll noticeably lag, but its manageable.
---
It's 3 by server not for the whole account ...
---
There was a thread yesterday about a server being nominated for an unofficial LBQT server. I can't find it but I'm sure there would be guilds in that thread/server that aren't intolerable asshats. Good luck!
---
Most landlords don’t want to be locked with a bad tenant.

Just when you want  to argue that no, video games aren't addictive, there's a rogue on voice activation proving the game is a Skinner box.

Grats on getting your name!
---
If you have a useless raider, it is far smarter to kick them than to carry them then starve them of gear.
---
Elemental is definitely better for PvP, enhancement is only good for cool montages of one shots that happen once in a blue moon. Going resto/elemetal is actually optimal btw, you want to put 30 point in elemental and 21 in resto in order to get Nature's Swiftness.
---
As for leveling, elemental becomes good once you get 5/5 Lightning Mastery.
---
grobuluus will be more world pvp guild focused, with rivlarys, then hardcore pvpers on regular realms. im pretty sure
---
surely you roll 0/21/30 unless you're on a PvE server, the difference is miniscule in dps.
---
Easy leveling? Throw him an affliction warlock, bind drain life to every key and life tap to one, and call it a day.
---
&gt;Either the population stays big and we have queues with no layering or it stays big and we need layering forever, not just "a couple of weeks"
---
You missed the best solution, one that Blizzard has even utilized before. If the permanent population is significantly bigger than expected then Blizzard can open new servers and offer free transfers from the overpopulated servers to a new one.
---
I mean if you are struggling on normal then what is the point of doing daily's? You dont need the minimal power growth that they give. The follower stuff (past the first week or two) is purely cosmetic. I am a healer and I had to get exhalted on 2 characters for nazjatar and mechagon just for the rank 3s but im done (and did not start one till one was already finished). I completely agree with you in principle but I feel like a lot of people (myself included) could just not do the vast majority of it and be fine. One of our better players did not do islands or world quests until he needed to unlock essences and no one can tell the difference. I can think of any reason I will be "exploring" in vanilla once I am 60 either tbh. Not sure its better, just different.
---
And only two using exactly "blizzard"!!! Wow!
---
I certainly could tell the difference when I played the private servers vs retail in terms of responsiveness and missing out openers/boxes at the same time as people. So I am afraid the 80ms could bump up if I have people on my internet and cause it to jump to a point where it is more noticeable. Mentally yes I am a min maxer, I have my fps high, on a 144hz monitor, I like fast and responsive ping :P. Sure that has a part to play here, but I think I have a legitimate case to reason why its still a better option.
---
it also has a stupid amount of sugar. its just as bad as soda for you.
---
The 26th\* and probably pretty high unless you're one of the lucky few who manage to sneak in just as they go up, assuming you don't get DC'd first.
---
I know it did. That's why I'm mentioning it.
---
can they be made to work in a raid? yea somewhat ish, though it is not worth the investment for you and you will not beat the top dps classes so its not worth it for a serious group either. If you can heal you probably should heal in vanilla
---
Windows+shift+s is the superior screen shot technology
---
I can’t imagine sitting still and doing it
---
I'm east coast but normally can't raid till late, so I've always played on western servers. Easier to snag groups at 10-11pm EST on western servers.
---
If you are worried to be alone I would like to invite you to our guild (if you don't mind playing horde).
---
I only knew one person in the guild before I joined and so far everyone has turned out great and there is a lot of activity. Just this evening there was a wow lore quiz on discord chat. And even on odd nights there is generally someone to chat to.
---
We intend to raid and take it somewhat seriously. Not min maxing harcore but still aiming to succeed. There are people who want to RP and are willing to help you take your first steps. If RPing isn't your thing that's fine to.

You are more than welcome to come discover our community for yourself at https://discord.gg/7H8rqg

Good to know I was not the only one who thought that.
---
Why so salty?  I’m pretty sure the dps who is pulling 99% parses and is top of the meters with perfect attendance isn’t the problem, it’s the gm and his buddies who pass gear around like a drunk broad. I’m sorry I don’t have four hours after raid every night to sit in discord and listen about how much your job sucks and waste time befriending you because you don’t have any friends in real life

Fairly happy with my names.

Hence his fanbase being pro Trump
---
wow, i can hear this in my fucking brain
---
I'll be charging a Ret tax to any of them that wish to join my groups. 5s at level 20, scaling up to 5g at level 60
---
&gt;You then starts to talk about other changes that I didn't bring up.
---
That was not what I said. I said it's ridiculous to say that there aren't any changes. When there's a whole host of things that are changed. 
---
&gt;You brought up NOCHANGES and you brought up other unrelated changes, not me, and then you started refuting your own arguments I never made. So right now we are arguing over your straw man argument.
---
I brought up stuff that was changed. That's not a strawman argument. 
---
&gt;I say, no, this is bad. I don't want any custom changes added to the game and especially not customs spells added to gameplay.
---
The point of my original comment was to tell him why people don't want changes. It wasn't to support a bunch of new skills added to the game. That being said, in a way, the new macro system has created the potential for skills to be used in ways that weren't possible originally. An example of that would be targeted AOE.
---
But for every snowflake that leaves in the first 1-3 months, there will join someone who wants to play the fuck out of this game. New PvP servers are needed.
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
I love you Alexensual, but you can be unstable, intense, and border-line maniacal. Your authenticity is your best trait, and can lead you to long-term success. In all sincerity, please see a therapist and stop fucking around. (former mod here).
---
Seems better tbh.  Though that game obviously needs a leveling overhaul.  120 max lvl is a little bit ridiculous.
---
I’m at an absolute loss for real. Thanks for taking time to try and help, I appreciate it.
---
There is currently no confirmation on the end time, so presumably until soon before launch.
---
Ya know just kickin it waiting for launch...
---
Easiest, smoothest, overall leveling experience is probably Hunter.
---
Hunter has a struggle from level 6-10, but if you can quest with him and get him past that hump, it's literally impossible to fail once the level 10 pet quest is done.
---
Paladin/Shaman is great, because they have self-healing and they're mostly auto attack based. The downside is they're auto attacked based and he might get bored.
---
Definitely do not recommend warrior, it is the harshest leveling experience in the game. Rogue is second worst.
---
If only Borderlands 3 came out two or three weeks after its current release I'm sure it would attract quite a few viewers. Now it's in the middle of the initial Classic hype wave.
---
I think it's a combination factor of being forced to rely on your teammates not being shit and being stuck with them for an entire game. One bad player can make a huge difference when it comes to team fights and cost the game and the penalties for abandoning the game are far higher than say, leaving a dungeon that's wiping
---
Quin69 on the Alliance? Well that seals my decision...FOR THE HORDE!
---
I got Mineva, and Buttblaster, sry for your loss.
---
Amazing. I got Zharvakko, the Witch Doctor. Couldn't decide between Moose and that.
---
Whole of norn iron is it?
---
That's why they're outside the Herod walls..
---
What exactly do you bring to the table in a melee group with a shaman as Survival?
---
Probably unpopular copypasta
---
Will consider it if we don't find anything else, still a bit scared that there might be some conservative folks in there, and to be honest I don't think I can stand another devastating guild kick again without breaking apart inside...
---
But I'll keep it in mind in case I feel a little more adventurous.
---
But why do you have to say that you’re a girl? 
---
I don’t think any guild has ever questioned my gender and only bothered telling online friends when it seemed appropriate.
---
well played sir/madam
---
(undead Rogue)was hoping for Psycho but nope :(
---
Since I'm rolling on Rppvp I figured I'd just snag a unique, cool 'sounding' name that had some meaning. 
---
Settled for Sicarius.
---
In Latin, Sicarii is the plural form of Sicarius "dagger-man", "dagger-wielder". ... In later Latin usage, "sicarius" was also the standard term for a murderer
---
It's a minor boost, but not substantial enough to justify playing gnome if aesthetics are more important to you. I'm not saying gnomes don't have the edge in a pure dps race; it's just a relatively tiny edge compared to, for example, non-human warriors vs human warriors.
---
r/woosh
---
&gt; The problem is, our voices (especially mine) are quite revealing (as in, a bit too masculine to pass as a girl)
---
I understand that actually being recgonized as a girl is a big part of your personality, but I have to say that people will only notice your voices if you already told them that you are girls. I cant say that I know what it's like as im not trans and never had any wrong feelings about being a man, but would it be that hard for you to just not tell people you are girls and just let them think whatever they think about your voices? If someone do happen to notice something about your voice you can just say that you are a girl with a masculine voice?
---
You are a girl, just tell people you are a girl if they ask, it is just an online game you dont have to tell them you are trans.
---
I wasnt a part of the situation so I cant know what happened, but if I were a guild leader and anyone asked me "Hey do you have my back if this or that happens?" no matter what the subject were, it would raise some red flags for me, because it tells me that these people expects some drama and it is easier to just kick these people before any of that stuff happens. 
---
Honestly I dont think it has much to do with you being trans, but more the way you approached it. Again let me use a stupid example, but if someone told me if i were a GM "Hey i absolutly love pineapple on pizza, will you have my back and protect me if it causes some drama?" It would just tell me that these people care too much about what others thinks and would rather cause drama and keep defending themselves instead of just thinking "Well I dont care if you think people who love pineapple on pizza are distusting, thats your opinion and Ill let you have that, and live my own life in peace"
---
I hope you get my point, that any kind of drama is bad for a guild and anyone who cant just mind their own business and needs absolute acceptance from anyone in the guild is bad for the guild.
---
Ive been in guilds with plenty of people that I think are absolute shit people and probably people who thought so of me aswell, but as long as we just ignore eachothers bullshit and mind our own business, the rest of the guild dosent care. But if we have to argue everytime we get the chance, either we gets kicked or people will leave the guild slowly and the guild will be ruined.
---
I can’t believe being anti-LGBT is actually a thing, yikes! Wish ya best of luck. Fuck those people

---
I wanted to try Requiem so bad, but half way through the modding tutorial I fucked up and maybe the game file unplayable. Didn't care too much since I'm alway abandoning saves anyway, but was upset I couldnt try what seemed like the mod that fixed all my gripes about Skyrim.
---
I rolled with a core of about 30 irl friends and we're allowing meme specs so we have an enh confirmed. If you can roll with friends or get into a raid core early on and make a rep for yourself as being helpful and cool you'll get a slot.
---
I’m playing “dream about wow classic” and watching old and new guides
---
Right but there is no way to confirm that it was the MS that cost you those things. It could be a packet loss issue with PServers, it could be other players reacting faster. Just random stuff. In the end, I can't blame you for wanting to be on the best server for your region. Especially if you have no other reason to pick otherwise.
---
I would love to say that I will be, but I can guarantee he is not as committed as I am to the first week grind and so I will likely not be. Seems people are recommending hunter/warlock for the pet aspect which I think is a good idea.
---
Oh this is fucking golden
---
Makes me want to plan things out, but I am kind of lazy. Just following my guild and going back to the past blind!
---
What is this, round 3 of the democratic debates with shity instigatory moderators?
---
I created a character about a couple of hours ago and it said "high". I could still log into the character selection screen on Shazzrah when it said "full". I also doubt that there would be a higher peak 24 hours later. If anyone else knows this better than me, feel free to correct me.
---
Google doc of the results not working anymore?
---
The endless blizzard fellating posts are much more original clearly
---
Why would having hardcore players on your server matter?
---
Because it doesn't release until the 26th.
---
Salt is amazing though...
---
Because it’s not August 26th, the release day
---
i was not exited about classic since i used to play classic wow like a maniac with my rogue .
---
Most of my guild  started with bc  /wotlk  and are super  hyped about classic  , i was like " meh ill play it so you can see how shit the balance was " 
---
but since i played the stress test it was like a old hit if crack.. and now i can't wait to play classic and am bored as fuck on bfa :/
---
Honestly in Dungeons Ret is fine, sure they don't dps like a rogue or warrior but they bring great buff and defensive utility spells.
---
Shadow DPS do acceptable damage as long as they have mana. They have to constantly chug potions to keep up. Besides, they can help the raid in ways other than shadow weaving with Vampiric Embrace (put them in the warlock party and they can freely life-tap without costing the healers' mana)
---
Why would so many people be logged in RIGHT NOW, after midnight EU time? Name reservations have been open for 24h now. There's no point being logged in...
---
You can probably mod your Games and replace the Loca.
---
&gt; What I do know is that idleing in cities was never bigger than in Vanilla in other expansions (atleast up til Cata which is where I quit).
---
post proof or stfu, oh wait you have none because you are talking out of your ass, fuck off m8 not even reading the rest of your trash post
---
You should look over the search results here for "hunter macro" because most of these have already been answered.
---
Yooooooo dudde, not sure how you fell through without me replying. Daerlan, Odinmage/Nidoe and I and friends are starting a guild and playing in Herod, Alli, come join us if you want!
---
Seriously answering, the stress test was for a reason, they are making last-minute Corrections
---
I thought the streamers did everyone a solid with leaving Herod alone. I don't mind them at all and even watch some of their YouTube content but I'm super happy their community won't be on Herod, especially one golden turd.
---
Except 4chan gonna be there with a bunch of guilds with the intent of disruption of the server so there is that.
---
why this look photoshopped
---
If the chairs aren't right people won't stand for it.
---
Can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen.
---
Thank God we got all those other servers that are just taking up space
---
I straight up am going to use Vent. #nochanges
---
Yes, and? That's a very different scenario than starting off with those extra servers. Releasing with more servers that it turns out aren't needed leads to low population servers that need to be merged which causes vastly more community and economic damage than layering for a few weeks does. Needing to release more servers later and offering to let people voluntarily transfer to them for free is much cleaner.
---
It's going to suck the social aspect out of Classic, but if it wasn't going to be discord it would be some other social media advent.
---
A trolling eurotrash player.  Go back to retail.
---
Subjective or subjective? Subjective.

[bow down nerds](https://i.imgur.com/dcHFQEb.jpg)

Man, those buffs can make or change those 30 minutes of leveling.
---
I was happy with "Tusknorris" before I realized I was on the streamer server... And then decided to roll alliance anyway, so meh. I let it go, it might still be free on faer, who knows.
---
Not so fast. Heard that was the 4chan /vg/ server. Which is enough for some people.
---
Probably cuz I’m using a different font than the default one
---
Yeah, but that's regarding retail, atm we don't know how it's going to work in classic, blizzard would be shoting themselves in head if they'd only allow to play on pvp servers who pre-registered.
---
Heya, we are playing on Herod- Alli  a few guildies from Elysiun are getting together to make a guild, feel free to join us!
---
i have been on a pvp server since release. just know ganking will happen to you. If you get camped, then you create an alt to mess around on.
---
as far as 3 to 7 hours a day? should be fine, just depends what you want to accomplish ingame though.
---
No idea, but you sound like a prick so here's a downvote.
---
Addons you only really need an auto-attack timer.
---
Macros you just need: one for starting your rotation, one for feign trinket swap, one for feign death scatter shot. 
---
Anything more then that is just personal preference.
---
“We need the horde” 
---
*uses a human for advertisement*
---
Good luck
---
Sucks to suck I got my name LOL
---
Meki on Fairbanks.
---
No idea why this one was taken on every server as I've used it since long ago and never come across anyone else with it.
---
How do you know Pagle needs Horde?
---
You need to PVP a TON to get exhaulted PVP gear, and with it the highest rank PVP gear you can get and stay sane. Between that, crafted cloth pieces, and Tier 0 / 5 man Dungeon gear, you will be good to go to hang in PVP. Now when your guilds raid has Rag on farm, then for sure you will get to go to MC, even maybe with peoples alt raid. Once you have a solid raid that has a place on farm, all the try hard min/maxing really doesn't matter, people are just there gearing off specs or alts, and just having fun.
---
So you want a safespace in every guild where you can call yourself zim and zer to feel included? Sounds like you are enforcing self segregation not inclusion.
---
Nothing like that for the Horde?
---
Level scaling removes any reason to leveling up. I hate it. It exists in Elder Scrolls Online, and the fucked up thing there, is that if you don't upgrade gear, you actually become weaker as you level up. How messed up is that? Level scaling has completely ruined modern MMO"RPG"s for me.
---
so? You just do it a little bit before youre going to run out..
---
#current year
---
So that means that it’s very likely there are many more people than what their “full” designation requires signed up on this server.
---
Yeah, they are only going PST because they think it will be "easier" to be a dominant guild basically. I think the rationale is retarded. Who wants to be the big fish in a small pond? Why not challenge yourselves and go into the big boi server and battle it out with a high pop. That's just my stance against theirs though in the end. Need to find a guild on Herod :P.
---
Because I hated seen anyone talking about playing on whitemane? Ive only seen people talk about Thalnos, Herod and Faerlina. Whitemane is always left of out the discussion which leads me to believe the data is incorrect or misleading
---
Been in a server with good squad..zero issues?
---
Am I missing something? Mal'Ganis is awesome because it's full
---
They only nail ya if two users are on the same account, not if the same user is paying for two different accounts.
---
I think it’s good design and a good game.  But I may be bias.
---
I love a lot of older games, and I’ve enjoyed older games that I never played when they were modern.  So in my opinion older game doesn’t equal bad.
---
People weren't playing the game lol..
---
I used to loveeeeee it. . . then I learned to hate it.
---
sorry, I misunderstood your post
---
&gt;You obviously have zero grasp of software development.
---
what did you mean by that?
---
Yoo, we are playing on Herod, Alli if you want to join us! You and your friends are welcome
---
Loot aint that complicated in classic unlike retail so doubt it.
---
Yay Soilwork
---
Imagine having a nice RP session and your partner/group suddenly disappears mid-sentence and other people appear around you... how does your character explain that?
---
Yeah, I assume "full" means it is literally filled with max number of accounts.
---
It's not about whether you have sex or not. It's about buying into all the incel bullshit about blaming it on women. It says everything anyone would need to know about your mindset.
---
[All full but one](https://i.imgur.com/6FyNTyc.png)

That's because the twitch fans weren't in the beta

To be fair, all tanks do is just stand there and take damage.

Pagle is neutral and open to anglers of all races!
---
It has a red:ish glow. It might make you better against beasts but that's a mystery.
---
Thank you for contributing to this discussion
---
I agree with the poster above. If someone asks just say its my voice. Its really that simple. Nobody needs to know why your voice is higher or deeper or w.e
---
To me, it did come across that you wanted to let your GM know what your situation is. I've been in guilds for years and sometimes don't reveal IRL stuff because games are an escape for most of us and its where we leave IRL behind, and its kinda the secret rule most people follow IMO. Everyone kinda just lets the outside world stay on the outside.
---
If I was the GM I just wouldn't wanna deal with that drama either tbh. If you are only in the guild 3 days and bringing up stuff that nobody really cares about (lets be honest 98% of the people don't give a shit what your status is IRL in a video game, and 99% will not know unless you tell them) its kinda telling to me that this person might make a mountain of a molehill. Plus based on the text you gave you kinda seemed to ramble on and on towards the end when a simple few lines would have done just fine. I don't know how to put it into words but in my experience people that just ramble on with useless stuff are headaches to deal with when leading.  
---
Would I have done it in a ghost like manner like he did? No, i'd have told you straight up what the deal was if I was to boot you.
---
Also im not calling you a liar but how do we know this post isn't fabricated? Couldn't you have left and screen shotted it? I personally don't allow messages to be shown to me unless im connected via discord/friends.
---
Me? No. I'm stating the fact that that does not exist in every Guild.
---
Go instigation hunting elsewhere, LOL.
---
Change the sub background to Ragnaros  and let the fire cleanse all!
---
We let Blizzard enjoy 2 weeks of free money.
---
A normal server instead of pvp?
---
No thanks, casual.
---
Time too dude. After launch week/holiday weekend, I’ll have &lt;10 hrs a week to play. Id really hate to lose hours at a time being camped or whatever. Just a matter of available time.
---
Unless stated otherwise I'd assume Blizz are using the same filters for names and profanity as they are in retail.
---
You think Kneegrow is getting reported?
---
Yeah I wouldn't want to run around Azeroth with your name either.
---
Those script conditional macros will not work on the modern API. I've tried many of the ones you listed. Particularly disappointed that the aspect swap macro is dead, but it is what it is.
---
So many goose bumps man. Brilliant video
---
Is there a hotspot alternative that might work?
---
I do :)
---
Yes - to deter people from creating there.
---
No server is going to be "full" unless they hard cap the number of layers.
---
Don't worry, just play what you want to.  The raids In vanilla werent as hard as they're made out to be.  You can get Into raids as almost any class.
---
My guild on a ps had 3 boomkins in our core raid group and we killed rag many times.
---
I think you might be right unfortunately.
---
Right-o thanks! Does that mean higher chance to resist with each cast or reduces duration?
---
Hey don't worry. Based off of my account having a ton of renames after not playing for a while it seems a GM will force inactive players to get name changes so current subs can pay to use them!
---
Fairbanks. It's the least popular with a high pop. Won't get as much reddit/4chan/streamer shills
---
I like it.
---
did an ip lookup to find location from IP, but the info must be faulty. maybe because the servers are so new? Those locations make much more sense.
---
lf any short words like scar foul etc on shazzrah
---
you mean when you lay head to ass and fart on the back of each others heads?
---
Not unlikely if they intend to remove layering pre phase 2. The requisite to remove layering is to have a certain number of active players playing. Do we know what that number is?
---
I'm so excited to watch streamers cry.
---
Riiiiight. Because you would know what fascism looks like. (Says the likely Antifa goon)
---
I hope so, launch is already going to be a clusterfuck.
---
It's not possible for me, but I'm sure the highest tiers of trained neckbeards will find a way.
---
And again, that's fine. It's the accepted forum your guild runs with, then hey, do what works for you.  
---
I just pointed out that DKP has faults, and any points that have any traction FOR DKP, involve altering it with some form of Loot Council or intervention. Additionally you're now having to do a great deal more work FOR your raiders in order to make sure you DKP system is abused.  
---
My point was two-fold. Trust in your team is necessary, which by your system more or less makes that irrelevant, since you won't trust your raiders to know and learn enough about their class to know what's good or BiS for them.My second point was that when DKP requires moving away from the original concept of "get points, buy stuff", and you're subbing in Loot Council to make sure that only the "right" people get to bid, it may as well be Loot Council at that point. Nor will any of your propositions stop people from feeling like they got excluded for one reason or another.  Even if it's wrong or frivolous, you now either have to allow it, or risk issues. Who knows, then you become that guild the removes people because they didn't listen to the allmighty DKP master with his LOOT COUNCIL list of items and who can use points on them.  
---
I know you'll disagree, and that's fine. But you're creating a ton more work and far more avenues for angry people and issues further down the way. But if you want to do more, with less payoff, and far more drama and hassle, then go nuts. But at least don't tout DKP as some saviour.

Am I the only one that is legit super amused by the fact that Darnassus has a singular chair?  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
I mean, realtalk. Over a hundred in Ironforge. Over three-hundred in Stormwind. Makes perfect sense to me. Darnassus? A singular chair. Not 0. It's not that the Elves don't do chairs. They absolutely get the concept. But more than one would be overkill.  
---
And then you look at the picture, and it turns out the one chair in Darnassus isn't even elf-related. The Argent Dawn brought it along. Imagine how they must've felt coming into the city! I like to think it went a little like this:  
---
 "*Oof, long journey, I really need to rest my legs!*"  
---
-"*Well, guess what, son, us Night Elves don't do that goddamn pussy ass 'sitting' shit you're used to in the Eastern Kingdoms. You wanna rest, you do it *our* way, standing.*"  
---
"*No chairs? What the shit is that? I'm going to write Tirion RIGHT now and tell him to get at least one of them bad boys up in here*"  
---
-"*Okay, we can respect that, but NO MORE THAN ONE. And you better keep that stuff inside the building we allocated you*"
---
In vanilla I rolled east due to the fact that you can raid earlier so it's up to you if you wanna start at like at 6pm pst (so 9pm for east).  Raids were pretty slow back then so having an earlier raid time helped out a lot on my sleeping schedule.
---
Thanks I'll give it a look
---
I'll go have a look on the official forums, thanks!

***NOBODY*** cares who or any of us are on WoW. It's one of the nice things.
---
But most classes are good in 1.12. Hunters, not so much.
---
Nightfall with seal of the crusader is objectively the best proc uptime though.
---
I have tried to look at every single post on hunter macros. I tried to make sure I only copy and pasted the ones I found that people said that would work on classic and no private servers. There isn't many that I found that are confirmed to be working on the new macro system for real classic. Thats why I'm posting the ones I found that are suppose to be working in classic for someone to confirm or modify them to work. 99% of links when you type in just hunter macros are made for vanilla private servers not classic which is what I'm trying to figure out how to tell what works for classic or what is made for just private servers.
---
Do you have a character there? If not, are you able to create one?
---
After I made my characters last night the screen said I could adjust them for the next 335 hours aka 2 weeks aka launch day.

Why on earth do you think they reflect the WoW classic community? How would you feel if someone judged the whole LGBTQ community because of one bad egg?

Personally I've been switching to clear drinks because dark drinks are staining my teeth. So avoiding coke and pepsi. Admittedly though I do still drink sprite. Also I'm not sure where people stand on if carbonated water drinks are soda or not. So I guess you could say I like it but am avoiding it. However when Im strapping in for a long grind on OSRS I do line up a few cold ones
---
Why are you shaming the whole community because of your one isolated experience?
---
dead? this shit is going to explode. (for at least a couple of months)
---
Honestly just play the game because nobody is going to turn you away from a raid. In all honesty worry about buying a mount. The road too 60 is long.
---
just did it right now
---
So people can still create characters there if they didn't in the naming?

Hello! I and few gay friends are gonna be playing on Herod (Horde). Come join us!!

You can level as ret and respec to holy for a pittance.  You don't tend to need a mic for 5mans it is expected for raiding though.
---
Not as far as I know. STR gives 2 AP (only when in cat/bear form) and AGI gives 1 AP and a whole bunch of other stuff.
---
WTB more east PVP servers.

Then you should respect my opinion that while he can be a bit of blubbering loudmouth, the media does more to divide this country than he does. They spun everything Obama did in a positive light and do the exact opposite to Trump. Obama is now viewed as a good President when he was mediocre at best because of it. Most people are too busy with work and family to do more than read a few headlines of news a day and when 90% of them are complete BS like Trump saying Baltimore is invested with rats and crime is somehow racist, that’s what some people take away from the incident. That is in no way racist and is 100% true. Source: I live in Northern Virginia, Baltimore is an hour away and I’ve been there many times and it is invested with rats and crime. Other officials have said the same thing. Trump putting kids in cages? Then they use Obama era photos of kids in cages (they took down their photo and then posted ANOTHER Obama ere photo) and fail to mention Obama deported more people than any other President 😂. Not sending their best? Let me know how many Scientists, Engineers etc aren’t crossing the border through legal entry points. That doesn’t mean there aren’t good people coming through illegally, I’ve worked with 20 or so that were great people but that’s not what he said. This is America, you shouldn’t have to fear for your life for wearing a MAGA hat it’s absurd. 
---
Yeah he can be an idiot but he’s not the one dividing this country. Already forgotten about no collusion, a complete hoax that was pushed for two years primarily by a fake dossier that they all knew was fake but rubber stamped it through the FISA court? You can’t obstruct a crime that never happened. You don’t have to like him, heck I don’t even like him that much but we are at insane levels of propaganda here. People that preach tolerance and understanding and then want to beat someone in the streets for wearing a hat.
---
Streamers.

But those mad fake internet points I could get for securing my fake internet name for my fake internet character. *Muh pointz*

Remember that for those if us in the US the servers will have been up for 12-16 hours by the time we'll get on Tuesday morning.  It's not like were talking the first two hours here

Clashmt on all 3 EST pvp servers. Male orc rogue with white/silver hair. Pretty fucking pumped.
---
This is the tricky balancing act for Blizzard.  They don't want too many servers so that they die when the mass migration in 2 months happens.  But if the servers are too full, they can't turn off layering without causing its own chaos.  Probably one of the harder launches of a game to manage.  I can't think of another example where there's a ton of hype but everyone also knows that a ton of people will quit soon.
---
Eh I disagree with that. The leveling experience in the expansions where it was first implemented (Before applying it to all zones) have been very well received. It hasn't been since BC that you didn't already have plenty of choice about the direction you go in a new expansion. The scaling within an expansion of 5-10 levels isn't what feels bad. It's over a spread of 20-30 levels and the relative time of those levels. 
---
Which also is eased by the zones in a new expansion not being just dead to you at cap with world quests re-using most everywhere in the zone. Feelings about WQ's themselves aside, a core part of this problem that lead to scaling was there was no tangible reason to revisit those zones. So if you didn't get the story, well. I hope you like grinding quests for meaningless amounts of gold to see it.
---
You can drop the bit rate of discord channels... that’s what we did.
---
Man I want one for my warrior and warlock. They look so nice I'd consider hanging them up when I was done. Or just framing them and keeping them on my desk
---
Most of them got added into the pool of locked out names over time. But since those entries have to be made by hand updates on that added up over the years.
---
I couldn't tell you whether or not Darnassus would cause an issue (seeing as it is a location and not a major lore character)
---
When in doubt you could always contact the customer support (or play it cool and hope for the best like we all do in such a case :D )
---
Yeah.
---
I haven't picked my server or names yet but when it launches hmu if you go horde.
---
I got adversary, zedversary and skinnable I am pretty stoked.

This is equally as shitposty as the name claim posts

Thank you very much so anything that is /script isn't working on the new API that is good to know.  I hear the ones that have the ! are a little buggy too? I looked everywhere to find one that starts my auto shot and doesn't cancel it or restart it if click again so like a spammable auto shot button I couldn't find on any threads.
---
You dont need pre raid blues to kill Rag. The biggest problem, and what you didn't even mention, is getting hydro reputation to douse the fire.
---
For now, yes.
---
confirmed. it works.
---
Things usually die when they explode.
---
Reduced duration.
---
I honestly doubt you were kicked for *only* that.
---
But really, why did they never put it in the game?
---
Given your post history in a certain subreddit, I'd say fascism looks pretty quarantined right now, so go spread your garbage in your safe space.
---
Agreed on finding the right guild. They are out there. My vanilla guild used DKP but any gear that was for tanks went to our MT first, than OT, no questions asked. They never "used" dkp and couldn't bid on non-mainspec. They were basically exempt from the system (I think our MT missed one night and was late another for the entirety of vanilla; love you Raze if you're still out there). 
---
Everyone understood and we raided together, quite happily, from MC through Naxx, with minimal loot disputes (and one rather server-famous ninja loot). I'm in an LC guild now, but I do know the guild leader and he setup and ran a guild still in existence and still cutting-edge of raiding, so I trust that he'll set something up right.
---
Font?
---
This may come off a bit harsh, but devastating guild kick when you had been in the guild three days?  That’d be a bit of a yikes for me as a guild leader, there is such a thing as people that get too attached and clingy to a guild too quick. 
---
Not saying the circumstances of the kick were right or fair or handled correctly, because it wasn’t. But just offering some insight...if I’m a guild leader and someone 3 days in is already blowing up my DM’s with some potential long term issues that will likely come up over and over again, and I’m already dealing with that from 2 people with 38+ other people in the guild who will also have issues at times...all for a game that isn’t even out yet? That to me is probably more why you got kicked rather than it being a result of your specific circumstances.
---
Goelocating IPs is not an accurate method to determine location.  Many times that information just points to the hq of the company owning those IPs.  Unless Blizzard chooses to publically say what IP is in whatever datacenter location, the geolocation tools are just using the registered address for Blizzard.

Hunters are fine.  They've always been fine.  They will always be fine.  They have raid spots, they can PVP, they can farm.
---
If you find that addon let me know
---
I'd level a paladin just for this
---
I actually find "The Online Age" option to have the highest as far as "Social Fun" goes.
---
Yeah, but that won’t take us to August 27.
---
 Excellent choices sir!
---
How did they allow that profanity?!?
---
Instead of a upvote I'd give a wardrum roll if it was possible.
---
Not true, the level floors remain the same after scaling as they were before scaling was implemented. You can't start burning steppes at level 10, you can't start shadowmoon valley at level 60.
---
Postal is built into the game. You don’t need an addon
---
Alright, thanks for the info guys I'm removing this thread
---
So you don't fall under this category! 😁
---
Oh really ? Ofc i know that. But if they release a new server and i first have to log on and delete a character and then switch server i risk getting stuck in a queue and i don't need a third name on any of the current servers.
---
If that's how you want to interact with people then sure. In a hardcore raid environment, I can understand that as well. However, none of this is relevant in the discussion of DKP vs literally anything else because DKP is shit.  
---
How you divy out loot is irrelevant if you're going to cut people loose the second they show they can't keep up.
---
You can drop bit rates in discord channels... we made one just for fun.
---
We don't care about this....we are trying to play a video game...can't you just keep this to yourself?????? Why is it always about your cause.....where the F are the mods? We are not supposed to bring sexual orientation/religion/ politics
---
I am still shocked I got all my names, ones I have had since the original closed beta, and on the server I wanted when I just logged into it now.
---
I hope my server crashes while I'm on a flight path and I end up in the middle of some high level zone!
---
It was pretty hilarious when that happened in Vanilla.  Hearth was CD too so I had a long journey of deaths.
---
Don‘t forget that most people back in the day just stuck with whatever random server they got assigned (which was always a PvE server).
---
Basically what I expected. Couldn't stop laughing, I must be getting old.
---
This has been stuck in my head for years
---
Ok, I guess the 10% Thalnos Brazilian pop is 'insignificant'. If 10% of your server sucks, your server sucks. Sorry.
---
And? It's not a big deal.
---
The ones with actually good names have.
---
LGBT-friendly, not LGBT-only
---
I don't care about what the other people in the guild are. I don't care about their sexuality, their religion, whatever. I just want to play this game.
---
The only reason why I'm looking for an LGBT-friendly space is because I don't want to get into any drama because "hurr durr your voice sounds like a dude, you probably got a dick and get fucked by other men you gay dude"...
---
Can we get a full picture? I'd like to use this little cheat sheet.

I played a lot of AOE II the art was not worse in AOM and the gameplay was faster paced and more fun to me. It was hard going back to AOE II after playing AOM.

I will say the trying to run it as a group of lvl 15s during the stress test was challenging. Mainly because of all the pats that show up out of nowhere while you're in the middle of a trash pull. I got to do some pet tanking though, so that was fun.
---
I'm taking time off work starting on the 28. So I will get out of work the 27th by 15:00, go home, have lunch, and play all the way through next Monday.

toxic private server guilds going Herod
---
Right? I feel like I'm just back here sippin tea with a monocle, laughing at all these folks thinking the "classic grind" is a serious thing. Like, boy, in the amount of time my casual ass got from 1 - 60 in classic I got a SINGLE hell level in EQ. Bring on that "classic grind".
---
On many private servers there have been massive efforts to make them as realistic as they could get it. Unfortunately the data they had to use was incomplete, so there’s discrepancies vs classic. However for the most part private servers that tried to be true to Vanilla are actually incredibly accurate considering what they had to work with.
---
 Wikipedia lists it as racist term https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs
---
Sure, but I want to tank and I'm pretty social, so I can't "just not talk".
---
Mainly how many people are in the servers discord servers and subreddits etc I know it's not accurate
---
From number 1 on reddit to this

People who clearly dislike him watch his every move religiously... just move on and quit getting yourself all wind up over someone doing their job and being entertainer. His persona is not for everyone. But I don’t see his “cult” doing damage, i see the haters spaming asmon posts all the time tho.... who’s worse?
---
Maybe it's because they are full?
---
You bring up a good point. I do put in some work socially but I simply don’t have enough time to befriend everyone. I try to make my time with people count but it still rubs me the wrong way that the worst dps often gets the loot. I’m sittin here #1 or 2 on dps meters and an upgrade drops, most loot councils I’ve dealt with say “give it to x, he’s below the other mages and needs it!” Completely ignoring the fact that I came with full consumables and pre raid bis, I demonstrated more value to the guild by giving them my time and dedication and they give the loot to lazy people who “need” it to stay competitive.
---
Well, the T\_D trolls brigaded the post about language. Those people are scum. You shouldn't worry, and should have fun. Blizz won't enforce language rules, because those people who don't speak English would effectively be silenced.
---
Why would you be forced to change it?

Good thing you didn't need to count them, then.

That's exactly how things play out - It happens at the start of expansions and every major patch when guilds form a Mythic Core and they get stuck on the first few bosses for a night while their friends guilds are progressing.

---
You should try to get an nvme ssd (over sata) and 3200mhz ram (over the 2600). IPS monitors are better than TN for WoW, I'd recommend the Nixeus 27" for $399. An i5 and 2060 are fine, although AMD is better bang for the buck right now.

Yup.  It's a great server with a good community.

**&lt;Circumflex Accent&gt;**
---
Horde | Whitemane | NA (Pacific) | Semi-Casual PvE/PvP
---
**About Us**
---
Circumflex Accent is a gaming community nearing a decade in age made up of close friends who have stuck together across a variety of games over the years. We pride ourselves on community and building lasting connections throughout games. We plan to play semi-casually, enjoying re-experiencing Classic WoW and seeing how far we can go. Our experience as a guild ranges from playing very casually to world top 20 raiding in Wildstar, and we’re coming into Classic with a range of people from those who have never played WoW before to those who cleared the original Naxxramas.
---
We’re looking to level, run dungeons, PvP, explore the world, mind control Alliance players off of ledges, play portal roulette, and, if we get the interest and players, re-experience some of the good old Vanilla raids.
---
**Where You Come In**
---
Do you want to play WoW in a laid back environment? Can you joke around but still focus up when it’s time to be serious? Can you prove to us that you’re not an axe murderer (in ten words or less)? Then this might just be the place for you! We’re looking to bring some more people into the fold to experience what really made Vanilla WoW great--the community.
---
DM me (RallinaTricolor#8388) on Discord for more information!
---
I haven't played since cata. Hearing about things like scaling and layering breaks my heart. I'll never play retail because of this. I hope that one day the entire game gets revamped or we get like a WoW 2 and all the horrible aspects are erased. Yea I know it'll never happen. :/
---
For me, if a Paladin plays as a utility class and **uses his/her skills** then I have no problem.  I have a problem when there are *hybrid* classes that intentionally pidgin-hole themselves into one, distinct spec and don't even try to help out the group with the rest of their utility.
---
Would love to, but we're living in the EU :/ Have fun though, keep the rainbow sparkling over there :)
---
Found my new fetish
---
Whatever you say boss. Hope you have a great time playing classic despite our disagreement.
---
Actually yeah, I just went back and looked at the Allen Brack interviews from after the Nost shutdown and he said that the devs at Blizz were sort of spurred into action because of Nostalrius, so I was wrong.

I really should get on making some Whitemane memes. They seem to be lacking.

I don't think there will be a drop off from the major pvp realms. I  think they will increase in popularity. Especially if other realms starts dying.

The curses in MC would make it impossible I think.

What about server changes i know All servers will basically be like Full and have que times lol but if one dies out. Will there be a fee if we swap servers? or is that still undecided?

¿Qué?

You sound like a really nice person. I agree with all the folks telling you that it's not as big of a deal as you think it is. You and your girlfriend just need to be yourselves, and have fun with the game and your guildies. Sure there are jerks out there (humans can't even get over skin color and religion), but I like to think the vast majority really just don't care about your gender or sexual preferences. We're all just looking for nice people to enjoy the game with.

PSA: you can eat and drink at the same time.

RetPaly vs a bad hunter?  I'd take any decently played class over a bad player, I would expect just as much from anyone else.
---
Fair enough, I just can’t see the hype from my community (OCE) anywhere. But that’s a totally valid point thanks.
---
I'm going to roll my main on a ps and see how fast I can level. What skills I need. 
---
For instance, Warlock. I want a wand ASAP. So I'll hit level 5 and get enchanting and tailoring. 
---
The Brown Robe is the first green item I can make. Need Tailoring lvl 30
---
ClassicDB shows the Bolt of linen cloth turns yellow at 25, green at 37. 
---
2 linen per bolt, need at least 50 linen to reach Tailoring 25. Might get lucky and get Tailoring 30 with 5 more bolts, needing at least 10 more. So at least 60 linen cloth just to get to Tailoring 30. (probably more)
---
Then I can make Brown Robes with all those bolts. Robe takes 3 bolts of linen, so if I made 30 bolts I can make 10 robes. 
---
Disenchanting those 10 Robes should get you to Enchanting 10 at least, netting you 1-2 Strange Dust, SD,  (80%) and 1-2 Lesser Magic Essence, LME, (20%). Need at least 2 LME
---
Lesser Magic Wand is Enchanting 10. Needs 1 wood, 1 LME. Plus you need the Runed Copper Rod (1 SD, 1 LME) Again, should be good from the Robes. If not make more and DE them. 
---
Then you have your wand early on. Should be faster on a Warlock with the Imp helping with the linen farming.
---
I agree with that Barrens/WC feeling. They do feel very connected.

---
I'll be 100% honest with you: both your post and most of the comments by others on your post are cringey.
---
That said, the only thing that I think is worth talking about is you, because you and your gf are the ones who are hurting right now, and I have zero hope of changing the minds of ignorant people here on Reddit.
---
But I still have to try, I guess, so...
---
To those who think sexuality has nothing to do with anything...you're wrong. It matters. If it didn't matter, trans people wouldn't be getting killed for being trans. If it didn't matter, ace people wouldn't be getting raped in attempts to 'fix' their sexuality. If it didn't matter, women would be respected as people no matter what they looked like. If you've never had to deal with coming out as \[trans/ace/bi/gay/demi/whatever\], this might be hard to understand. If you've never dealt with being a woman (and yes, trans women ARE women), then you have to also accept that you don't understand *and make the effort to*. The OP just wants to find a group of people to chill with that they can feel safe with, and be themselves around. They haven't found that. They're struggling with it. They want their guildmates to also be their friends, but how can they be friends when people react to them with disgust? That sort of rejection hurts. Someday the OP will be able to pop into a voice chat and everyone will hear 'girl' and not question it, but until that day comes they want to try and ensure that they'll be okay. 
---
Now, OP. I'm not going to pretend that I understand fully what you're feeling, or what you're going through. I don't. I'm not trans. But I know it's hard sometimes, and people are shitty, and it's difficult to find the right kind of people to play with in this game. Nobody's surprised. This game is full of racist, misogynistic pigs (among other things). It's super difficult to weed out the hateful bigots to find the Good Ones. So I'm here for some suggestions to make things easier.
---
1. Posts like this are not only tl;dr, but they're oversharing. I'm not talking about the trans thing, either; you can't change who you are, and it's central to the issue you want to discuss. I'm talking about the really long post. You probably should have cut out a lot of the fluff.
---
2. Related to the above, you incriminated yourself in this post quite a bit. The screenshots of you 'coming out to the guild leader' are mainly what I'm referring to. It wasn't the best way to go about it. For starters, he said he didn't have time to talk, so...you should have considered, or at least asked, that he might not have time to chat. (A lot of times when someone says 'no time to talk' they mean in general, "no time to have a discussion.") So not only did you assume you knew what he meant by 'I don't have time to talk', you steamrolled him with a textwall. He pretty much showed his true colors right away, anyway. Like, not to be That Person but "I have to remain somewhat neutral" means...he wasn't the kind of GM you wanted.
---
3. You sound clingy and over-friendly in this chat. You promise drama after saying you hope there won't be any. (Your wording spoke the drama into being, seriously: "when shit really really goes nuclear." You TOLD this guy you were gonna bring a truckload of drama into the guild.)
---
4. You say you have a tough skin and rant-moan after getting blocked. I get that you were hurting A LOT when you typed that, and that it didn't even send, but I would not have shared it here. 
---
5. I don't know WHAT prompted "As long as you're on my side, I feel incredibly safe" but oof. Weird. Awkward? Cringey.
---
I'll be real with ya, OP: this dude smelled the drama a mile away and eliminated it immediately. I can't say I blame him. I'm sure you and your gf are awesome people 99% of the time, but this is not your shining moment. 
---
I think you're making a better effort here on Reddit by just being open from the start about what you're looking for. Saying, "Hey my gf and I are both trans and we're looking for a safe and fun home and new friends!" is gonna get you a lot further than three days of fun with a random guild and then, "Hey btw we're trans and there will be nuclear levels of drama over this but it'll be okay cause I feel safe as long as you're by my side!"
---
I'm not sure if you could have said anything else to the GM to make things go smoother, but what you did do wasn't the right approach for sure. I think if you had stopped and asked when he'd be free to discuss something important (and waited until he wasn't distracted to message him with the information), it might have started off a little less rocky. I'm sure you were nervous as HECK (I would be, sharing personal information is never easy), but boy were you over-talkative. Take a step back, look at how much you said vs. how much he said. This is really important consideration when learning how to read people. He was busy, he wasn't invested in this conversation, and he made it clear right away; that you kept dumping large paragraphs on him probably just made it worse. Also, rambling is totally normal while nervous, but it just comes off as needy/clingy/a potential problem in this context. The guy's obviously not the greatest person in the world (and DEFINITELY not what you need in a GM, he's too spineless), but I think you were trying too hard to convey information and reassure him, and what it ended up doing was having the opposite effect.
---
If this kind of thing ever happens again, make sure you have someone's nearly undivided attention and stick to basics to start. For example: "What is the guild's policy on hate speech/harassment?" (I personally wouldn't join a guild if I didn't already know the answer to that, but...)
---
Protip: keep 'drama' out of your wording. Don't mention it, don't bring it up unless they do first, don't make it an issue.  Drama isn't a part of being LBGTQA+. Does it come with it? Sometimes, 'cause some people are vile. But always make someone else use the word first; don't even plant the idea in their head that you're the one initiating the drama (which is what happens when you bring it up).
---
Anyway, enough criticism! I want to offer you both some support. I know this happening hurt the two of you a lot. I'm not placing all the blame on you guys, either; I know you were nervous about coming out to your GM. If it's any consolation at all, I'm sure this guild wouldn't have been a good long-term fit for you no matter how you'd approached the subject. He just didn't seem like the type to go up to bat for others.
---
It's hard to find a group of good players to play with, especially when you're looking for a guild of people who aren't bigoted gamer bros. Been there, done that. (I've found LGBT+ guilds that hated aces, or that were racists, or were constantly spamming chat with R rated discussion; it's NEVER easy to find what you're looking for, even when you think you've found something good.) 
---
I'm sorry that you thought you'd found a good potential home and it turned out it wasn't a place that would accept you for you. Honestly, truly—you have my deepest sympathies.
---
I hope you find a good place to call your home, with people who will love you for you, and that you'll go on to create a lot of amazing WoW memories together!
---
Some small tips: RP and RP-PVP servers tend to have more LBGT+ guilds on them, if that is at all helpful! Look for a guild that openly doesn't tolerate hate speech or bigotry. Don't settle for less than what you want in a guild, especially when it comes to the social aspect of it. The point of a guild is to be at least a little social! 
---
Best of luck, OP. I'll be wishing you and your gf the best!
---
I like both but the true top dog was Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds!
---
that's what I'm hoping...
---
I don't want anyone else to hear my burps and farts.
---
&gt;will he be able to join this server?
---
might be as simple as removing the "-master" in the name.
---
You can /laugh, why send a smiley face instead.  Chat should emulate speech, emotes cover your emojis.  I don't know why they would be good at all. /shrug
---
I agree.  It goes with the whole thinking of "just because you can doesn't mean you should."  Sure it's cool tech but overall, it's bad for the game.
---
PM me if your  issue isn't already solved.
---
Do you feel less hype now?
---
Player created events
---
That is a complete misrepresentation of everything everyone said about this topic. I've played on pservers with players from other countries and gotten along just fine with people from all over. My issue is with the few known groups that will try to take stuff over. If there isn't a rule you can bet it will happen. English on US servers in general chat is a very light but appropriate rule.
---
But I must say, you being upset about me wanting to "deny" groups from "playing the game" and then gloating about a group of people on Reddit being censored for political/cultural opinions is peak irony.
---
True, but I don't think talking privately to the guild leader was coming out to everyone or starting drama. It seemed like it was done respectfully and with discretion.  It wasn't like "hey everyone..." I think she was just wanting to find out if they would be accepted in guild. Turns out they weren't, so they probably dodged a bullet. And the guild lost a holy priest/prot warrior.
---
And when ever I log into shazzrah now all I'm going to think is 
---
I'm forever blowing bubbles
---
pretty bubbles in the air
---
they fly so high
---
nearly reach the sky
---
then like my dreams
---
they fade and die.
---
Fortunes always hiding,
---
I've looked everywhere,
---
pretty bubbles in the air!
---
no I feel more than ever
---
It takes 30 seconds. Just remember where everything is you want, you can practice before you even delete
---
&gt; You made a mountain out of a molehill. By preparing for things going 'nuclear' you made it clear that if something came up you were going to cause all sorts of drama if you had to deal with the fact that not everyone accepts your view of the world.
---
Yeah, I see that now, I'll keep it in mind.
---
&gt; You want to avoid this kind of stuff, stay out of voice chat, use gender neutral screen names, and never talk about your sex/gender/whatever.
---
I'd love to just play a role that can stay in the background, but as a tank it's kinda obligatory to be in voice and be central. But I see your point, it might be time to give up on my hopes and ambitions...
---
just stay off of WHITEMANe
---
bullshit don't listen to that shit. I enjoy playing on my own, nothing to worry about apart from my own egotistical needs. I can lvl and do shit on my own pace and when I hit max I can join a guild appropriate to my own play style and pace. For me it's the best way. Playing toghetter is not inherently more fun or even faster. It can be quite liberating to enjoy things for yourself and it doesn't have to lack meaning either. Just learn to enjoy your own company.
---
I don't feel like disclosing my reason, I'm just posting some generic information that I received.
---
I’d like for Grobbulus’ mouth tube to attach to my ass
---
You right , the Americans should go-to EU
---
Considering 4chan has 8.2 million unique users, and from looking at Whitemane's discord, yeah. Lol.
---
Edit: Oops that number is 9 years old, it's 22 million users now.
---
What's the situation with Fairbank? Every server seems to have its own thing. There's a Brazilian one, a Spanish one, a streamer one, and an anti-streaner one. What's Fairbanks?
---
Why does there constantly have to be something? ADHD generation always needs stimuli? I’d rather eat nothing than eat dogshit
---
One of the reasons I'm iffy about coming back is I know nothing about modern raiding voice chat and I would just rather use vent and was worried it wasnt a thing anymore
---
I got Wound on Shazzrah for my rogue!
---
It boggles my mind that there are the same amount of PvE as PvP servers. Who wants to play PvE? Doesn't make sense to me, World of Warcraft is a PvPvE game, PvP is the core of the excitement.
---
Tekken 7
---
Lol right!
---
This.  
---
Don't underestimate the neckbeards.
---
 I heard that even Brazilians didn't want to play with Brazilians, because they're so bad.   idk what that means though.
---
No its not.
---
I'm running a laptop with a 960m, i7 4720hq and 16gb of ram(no 4k screen).  On the stress test I was getting 90-110fps max settings.  I'm sure the frame rate will dip around alot of people.  But so far it was running really smooth.
---
I raided when I was 14. Guild didn't care. Most people do not care.
---
I was over 11 thousandth in queue to reserve names on herod. It's going to be a shit show for sure but the people will get pissed and move in most cases and I would not be surprised if 50% of people never make it to 60 and even if the server has 15k people on it, that's a very healthy 7.5k playerbase.
---
At least two dozen people are trying to pay real world money to get the name "Fox" on Herod right now...
---
Youthought, youdid, But, youdidnt
---
Quadbox shamans.
---
Best advice I have is to do the side quests before the main quest when you reach that level. One of my major complaints of the game is that the main questline is where 80% of your XP is gained, presumably so side quests don't ever feel mandatory. I made that mistake on my first play through because I got sucked into the story and started ignoring the side quests in Novigrad and Skellige. Had to go back and do them all, and it takes all the fun out of it when the monster you're hunting dies in one quick attack.
---
Honestly, without mods to make the game actually hard, the game feels as difficult as a modern pokemon game. 
---
Dungeon traps? Pff, just activate it an warm up in the flames, or eat a few darts to see ur hp bar tick for a couple seconds.
---
Quests? Just follow this map dot, no need to use ur brain. Just fast travel an skip all this amazing world. 
---
Mods made skyrim the game it is.
---
It might also be some type of dynamically calculated value based upon the available resources.  I haven't been able to find a hard-cap on total realm pop with the layering, nor a hard-cap on the number of layers that can be spun up.
---
Finally, a real post. Probably going to be booted to a mega thread. Warlock is the superior leveler, but not by much. Shadow priest leveling is good. End game PVP is entirely situational. Warlocks tend to smoke low health targets like mages, hunters, and druids. Warlocks in turn get completely owned by rogues who get a start on them.
---
Priests do really good at locking down an opponent with blackout. Essentially it's a survivability race between whether the priest kills a target or runs out of mana.
---
Very similar play styles. If ally, watch out for undead with will of the forsaken
---
There is always L4D 1/2.
---
I got:
---
Nattytwenty (resto or resto/ele shaman)
---
Farty (undead holy priest)
---
Stinkleberry (doodad)
---
Yup same for dps druids/shamans/priest. Almost all Their issues lie with raids.
---
In Oz its 300+ a gram and an enthusiast can bang out a gram in an hour or two. At that point I mayaswell be snorting gold!
---
Tarantula and a bearded dragon. Both will be well fed before i go into battle.
---
They're both dank at all of that
---
I don't know how big his actual stream following is since he is so new to Twitch, but I and most people know him from his youtube channel SkarmTank and he's generally very well respected when he pops up as a guest in someone else's streams.
---
It's slow going really.
---
Not well so get a dps best friend. They will love you for lack of down time.
---
*slides in*, tell me more about this clover club
---
Then gets camped by a guy in a toaster.
---
If they bring Sanctity Aura, judge SotC, and don't pull threat, they can DPS when I tank dungeons as a Prot Pally
---
I know we'll probably never find out but I'd love to know how many characters have been created so far.
---
And more specifically how many constitutes "Full"
---
Do you want to have a lot of raid options at 4-5pm or 8-9pm?
---
I guess so, if you want to always play with  a helmet. Even then, most of the time the ugly pale face will be visable.
---
You don't care that I got the name that I played with back in the day before I did my gender/faction/race/name change though deep down it's still the same one I started with!?
---
They conducted the stress test to test their layering technology and server stability, with the added bonus of collecting more bug reports.
---
So they are using these two weeks to adjust the layering system and fix all those bugs.
---
That's part of the classic experience. The reason a lot of people are playing this is to see what it was really like, and for nostalgia.  Waiting for respawns was a good way to meet and chat with new people or get into pvp battles for them. The reason so many of us are against layering is that it isn't authentic to the original classic experience which made people that you ran into enemies, friends, celebrities, etc.  that you see from day one and recognize for better or for worse. You literally had to network to get good dungeon groups and guilds , unlike the current retail.
---
Same question here, as someone who is thinking about rolling a priest! :D I started in WotLK, so I've been used to dual spec.
---
What solo content?
---
Just wait patiently.
---
Wow dude I cannot imagine interpreting this post like you.
---
\*stares at L4D 2\* not a bad idea my good man
---
Slowly, with a friend or you respect a lot.
---
Here ya go! There's quite a lot of people there, I think Arugal in particular will do very well. https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H
---
You dare speak ill of the greatest content this subreddit has ever had?
---
too much of a commitment to play a game like that, I want something for 2 weeks not for 2 years!
---
Thanks a lot, I'll keep it in mind and I'll definitely not disclose that I'm trans if we're actually looking for another guild! :)
---
"This is why I avoid anything a dwarf brews."
---
Most of the "good" ret paly's I've come across don't sacrifice their entire mana pool on damage.  They don't mind using seals to help out the group.  They are quick with BoP's on healer/dps if they draw ammo.  They are quick to throw salvation on a tank if things are getting heavy.
---
They aren't actually full. They're just trying to distribute people evenly.
---
Winner!
---
I feel bad for the warriors getting their gear stolen by lolrets.
---
Let's not compare par for the course vile behavior typical of gamer bros with the struggles of the LGBT+ community in these specific spaces.
---
Get anything done IRL that you need to do as once it ends the game will have a hold on you that is inescapable until you hit level 60 on 2 characters.
---
I'm a smash bros guy if I ever do play fighting games.. thanks though my bruhhhther
---
You landlubbers are tougher than I thought!
---
On retail servers that capped at 3k players, maybe.
---
On Classic servers that are capping somewhere around 10k after layering, not so much.
---
BGs are giving exp?
---
i mean, they didn't in vanilla
---
Personally I’m just farming a WoW token now with the 2 weeks I have, and I did sub with mainly for the name save.
---
Nothing. 4 melee dps + shaman agi is better than 3 melee dps + shaman agi + mm hunter with TSA. I am better off in a different group maximizing personal dps.
---
Cool, but then why did you say traded? Wouldn't it be more accurate to say the name was given to him?
---
slowly
---
Yes, it looks like it allows 4-5 characters usually.
---
There’s no XP from BGs at all
---
I am taking a break from all games and spending time with my family. 
---
Come Aug 26th they are on their own.
---
You will suffer just like the rest of us.
---
Any decent spec can get into the raid. They probably won't melee much, but no one will really be able to tell the difference between a 31/0/20 or 20/0/31 paladin healer. Holy shock is not used in raids, and it's not like paladins will go oom or lack in raw healing output just because they don't take the 5% spell crit talents.
---
This way, in PvP at least, you can choose when to attack and when to play support and really play like a hybrid.
---
Should be plenty of room in a raid for 20/31/0 too, for Blessing of Kings, Sanctuary, and, yes, off-tanking.
---
Plus, healing when not needed as a tank is arguably more engaging than a warrior DPSing when not needed as a tank.
---
Chin up, mate. I hope you find a guild who let you off-tank.
---
I guess if you were gonna be up all night that’s one way to do it.
---
Totally disagree. Until BFA, on launch, the devs were still organizing level progression.. they just did such a neat job you didn’t notice it.
---
Realistically it would only take a couple of weeks of paid labor from a single dude to make leveling a new expac (lmao ten hours of gameplay) feel linear. So nah, that’s not why scaling was implemented at all.
---
A long time ago, before Esfand made videos or streamed. His buddy Drakova was raiding with us and he wanted to join our raids as ret paladin and I was the CL at that time. Wanna guess what I told him?
---
 Long story short he opted for PvP then. And I would tell him the same things again today.
---
no, because they are only "full" with respect to a single, layer-free server
---
It's obviously good game design.  There's a reason it got super popular at the time and it wasn't for lack of competing games.  Anyone saying it's just nostalgia is just misremembering why it was so popular.
---
Someone hasn't heard the news...
---
Not Mage's Blade
---
Just go to Zandalar then.
---
2 german servers are full, lets even it out and go on the oth...there are only 2 :)
---
4,000 member discord, 50+ guilds organised, 1400 people from a small survey say they're going arugal...   
---
yup completely dead.
---
Teamspeak.
---
Path of exiles is fun and free
---
WE’LL NEVER BE BORED!
---
This is depressing af.
---
&gt;  Imagine befriending people, having a fun time, loving playing with these guys and gals, and after a year or so they find out your trans and you get shunned/kicked from the guild.
---
My thoughts behind this is just that if you wait just a bit with the personal info and talk to a few people around the guild before you share, it should be very possible for OP to judge for herself if these people are idiots or not. I mean people who hate LGBT people, usually dont really hold back with dropping hints of this. So a few weeks talking to a few people should be enough for anyone to judge the personal character of these "guildmates".
---
Then yes once in a blue moon, someone may seem like a decent person, who will go absolute apeshit about finding out that someone is trans, but imho that is pretty rare.
---
I absolutly understand that you want to protect yourself, everyone wants to do that, myself included even tho im as standard as they come and have more confidence than necessary. But I dont share personal information until ive gotten to know people just a bit and judged them enough to know if these are people that I want to share personal info with or even people i wanna do dungeons with or just people that i think are rather shit people but just ignore as much as possible and let them be in the raids.
---
Imo the best way to protect yourself is just to spend a bit of time talking to people and judge their peronal character as best as you can and then decide what kind of role these people are gonna have in your life/gaming life.
---
Exactly me last night
---
I remember back when I first played leveling to 70 at the time with holy. Haha this time i have a friend to level with!
---
most who say that are from the private server community, drunk off some fresh-hype-dead trash
---
Completely understand, I’ve been grinding reps out and I’m almost done unlocking the last two allied races, about 8k left from both proudmoore and 7th legion, genuinely started asking myself if it would be worth it to keep going when I’m probably gonna be playing nothing but classic for a while.
---
Nope no xp in classic from it.
---
So what?  You played slightly longer without BGs at all than you did playing with BGs in Vanilla.  Should they just never put BGs in?
---
There are a few smaller streamers I like that chose to go on Herod. I just hope that purists won't specifically target them to try and bully them off the server
---
That sound is the proper pronunciation.
---
A week is possible but that takes a lot of no lifers knowing what they are doing and a lot of guild coordination i think days 9-11 is a lot more likely. Just to many things can go wrong in 7 days.
---
Lots of angry mobs. Everywhere.
---
Picked them up from the trusty site... Amazon :(
---
Do you ever think about if you’d die and your family went through your computer?
---
&gt; This is all bullshit and you know it. 
---
I absolutly dont know that no, and I wouldnt be saying what I am if I thought it was bullshit. You are welcome to read my post history if you want, ive made a lot of comments on this subject now and everyone except you seems to agree with what im saying.
---
First of all, OP has a masculine voice, so people will just assume the she is a male and ask no questions, unless OP activly tell them she is a girl. My point here is they are not gonna say "Hey you are a male!" they will hear a voive and make absolutly no comment, so what is the big deal in that? Unless they straight up ask about her gender, which wont happen. Let them be in the unknown for a few days, get to talk to people and once you made your own judgement if they are good people or not, tell them about being trans if you feel like it and if they seem like shit people find another guild with non retards and you didnt waste more than a few days. A hell of a lot people waste way more than a few days to find the right guild no matter how standard their lifestyle is.

Hunter

Welp. Thanks for letting me know. Disgusting. I'm depressed I have to share a realm with these people. I thought 4chan shitheads were rolling on Whitemane. -\_-

No one may care, but "Thworctin" is original, damnit.

Thanks to your help testing WoW Classic, we’ve fixed many additional reported bugs since the Beta ended last month. To really ensure that these fixes are all functioning as expected and prepare the smoothest possible launch in two weeks, we’ve just re-opened our closed beta realms for additional testing of WoW Classic.
---
All testers who previously had access to the closed beta are now able to log into those realms. Characters that were previously created on the beta test realms were removed, and level 40-character templates are now available. The level cap has been increased to 45. Characters in this range will find level-appropriate quests to explore in zones such as Stranglethorn Vale, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh, and Desolace.
---
As before, please use the in-game Bug Report button to submit issues encountered while testing. If you need more text space to explain an issue you encountered, please take it to our WoW Classic Support and Bug Report forum 2, which is now open for new threads.
---
This final closed beta test will end on Friday, August 16.
---
Thanks in advance to everyone who jumps in to test WoW Classic and help us prepare for its worldwide release on August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT!
---
[]( )
---
You are absolutely right. Giving small tweaks to make every deep tree at least respectable would result in a more fun and diverse game.
---
But that's not Classic, so it's not going to change.
---
Interesting. But about 30% of the LH pop is chinese players who never go to reddit.
---
Armour - warrior 
---
Swordart - pally
---
Sneak- rogue
---
Holy unexpected
---
I just thought it might not be a good idea to take enchanting cause its not a gather and everyone is saying get gathering skills basically. Wyt?
---
By being a druid.
---
Or keeping a set of dps gear around for cases like this
---
No news on anything being traded but I think the mods gave him a custom flair.
---
It's not just Hunters.  All the 'hybrid' classes make a choice to be a distinct class with no cross-spec utility.  My resto Shaman can't even drop a searing totem...
---
warrior - Taserface 
---
Rogue - Scissors
---
Well maybe it’s because you prefer your dildo to putting out!
---
Yeah, you get no XP in BGs bud. Sorry.
---
Low probably means 2 or 3 layers instead of 5 or 6 you'll be fine. Idk what OCE is though
---
A lot of people seem to forget that this was considered "EQ lite" back at release. 
---
The level grind was nothing compared to EQ or FFXI.
---
I'm a business owner that can produce results ahead of schedule, so I'm clearing out nearly 2 weeks of workload to go HAM.
---
It's funny how you're *so* sure of yourself and also *so* wrong.
---
The Zombie generation
---
My issue isn't mobs feeling like a threat but feeling like I am progressed past them. We need WoW 2, to wipe the slate clean and start new.
---
Hunter is pretty easy to learn. Also funny is affliction lock or rogue, but rogue is more complicated and needs the right Talents.
---
Nope not even on herod.
---
Tailoring/Enchanting is normal, tailoring basically feeds enchanting if you don't want to do enchanting I would do skinning as that's something you don't have to fight people over but it's not super lucrative. Tailoring, Black Smithing, Engineering, and Leather Working are all money sinks. If you are trying to just make cash go with 2 gathering professions if you want to focus on PVP go Engineer/Mining and if you absolutely love the idea of using stuff you make and are deadset on Tailoring I would still suggest Enchanting to Disenchant and AH all the mats, it costs nothing to put them up and they sell fairly decent.
---
Mages can do pretty well at a low skill level and have relatively few binds. They do have a high skill ceiling but probably one of the easier classes to get into.
---
Looks like the Classic ~~Publicity Hype Stunt~~ Beta Servers are opening up to ~~hype and promote~~ "test" the ~~already ready to go~~ game.
---
All I can think about is how dead that server will be once the excitement and hype peters out and the streamers move on to the new thing.
---
Scaling short for level scaling. Levels in game scale to each individual player. Not sure what personal, gatekeeping, "ackttually", definition you have, but it's wrong and the person you replied to represented it accurately.
---
It's August 26th.  That should help by one day.

Ok, I didn't narrow it down to NA. That's a fair point. You can play there if you want. Sorry I upset you by insulting your precious whitemane server.

That's what I call a fucking show!

BG XP was added 5 years after Vanilla came out.

---
Awesome! I was able to get my original toon's name on whitemane too! I can't wait
---
If you knew how to pleasure your partner I wouldn't have a need for any of these dildos.
---
You are not raiding as ret!
---
IMO scaling is dumb what’s the point of lvling then if everything just scales might as well make every mob the same level lol
---
Pretty sure the rule that all names need to be RP-friendly or you're subjected to being reported and forcibly name changed is still in effect on RP-PvP as it is with RP servers?
---
Streamers complained they had nothing to do for 2 weeks
---
"how do you kill that which has no life"
---
Sure if the lottery wanted to go out of business. I can’t believe you guys are trying to guilt me in getting a refund. Fucking sad go grind out some world quest or level your 10th alt or something. I have better things to do than play live. Live has been stale since cata and finally got a reprieve in legion. Bfa just slipped back between the cracks.
---
Can confirm seal twisting is alive and well in classic.
---
I tested this mechanic on a human paladin. It greatly increased my levelling speed during the stress test, in a packed elwynn forest and westfall.
---
Total time to 1-15 was 6:54 which included significant time wasted running to IF-Loch Modan and back again (I really wanted the +4 mail chest to PvP against horde).
---
Purely twisting in human zones only would have resulted in a 1-15 closer to, or far below, 6 hours, as I died a couple times in the damn kobold cave in loch Modan (dynamic respawns).
---
Priests are easy mode with 5 points in wand spec. Your sustain is silly good and as long as you keep your wand current you will blow through most mobs pretty simply. And you can heal as shadow you are just less efficient so it can be done that way too.
---
Imagine in Vanilla WoW if you only had to do like 1/3 of the quests in each zone to outlevel it. If you were at all interested in the story, wouldn't you feel pretty shitty if if you wanted to finish the zone's story, you had to halt your progression? 
---
And don't even say that they should slow down leveling then because there are 120 levels and if they slowed down to vanilla or even WotLK leveling speeds, no one would level 120 levels of that. People barely level 60 levels of that in Vanilla.
---
reddit, we did it!
---
All we can do is report them when we see them. They've already been banned from one Discord, so I doubt they'll be able to behave long on live.
---
Hey 3 of the 198 posts were actually hilarious!
---
Spam Consecrate and your only-on-undead spells.  I've seen ret paly's dump their extremely limited mana pool 15 seconds into a fight leaving nothing for that *oh shit* moment because they wanted a spike in DPS (but really only becomes a moderate improvement overall).
---
There will be a significant chunk of players who just enjoy leveling the occasional random battlegrounds and pugging molten core. I would say on most servers this will be biggest bulk of the server. Private servers were the more hardcore players i am willing to bet now that we have classic there will be more casuals on the servers.
---
Arugal (AU PVP):
---
- Osconty (Gnome Mage), farming alt for some time in the future
---
- Ausmon (Nelf Rogue), main
---
I was surprised I actually got either of those, since I couldn't log in for about 1.5-2 hours.
---
When somebody doesn't have the guts to tell people this personally.
---
Is the list out yet? I live in Japan and I really need to know if there will be an Asian server
---
And if you knew how to pleasure yourself neither would you!
---
LF Ava on Herod. DM me :D
---
The simple solution, would be for Blizzard to open/launch a BR/SA dedicated server and then let other NA players naturally flow to Thalnos without the fear of language/population barriers.
---
THEX! I'm so glad you got your name! I was really worried that you weren't going to get a happy ending on name day after hearing your appearance on CTC with Josh!

honestly if you are that worreid about world pvp just level up in dungeons for the few zones that will be camped hard. basically the only place to avoid would probably be stv and if you are horde there are quite a few decent alternatives.
---
Last bit of streamer advertisement before launch.

What on earth is a corn hole board.

Why are you putting corn in this board for? 🤔

CLOSED beta. God what a let down
---
/w [raid-leader] Kick Hunter pls
---
I like the name posts.
---
That's why I upvote them sometimes.
---
That's why other people upvote them sometimes.
---
That's why you see them.
---
That's why you're mad.
---
Because people like the name posts.
---
Herod Alliance
---
Ie - Human Rogue
---
Isd - Night Elf Druid
---
Drawf- Dwarf Priest
---
Still undecided which to level first and with what proffessions
---
Would love to see a Horde version.
---
I disagree, Hunter is easy to pick up and level but there is a lot of skill required to not get ass pounded at higher levels in PvP .
---
Yes it is :) I wanted deku but I'll take what I can get
---
You don't see the harm because you're probably not trans then. It's a big deal for us. Not to mention the odds of everyone in your guild being cool enough to come out too is very low, since you can't just ask some people to use one set of pronouns and leave the others confused, that causes even more issues. If someone can endure the misgendering, that's good for them, but for a lot of trans people that isn't the case
---
Hunter and druid are the hardest pvp classes. you need to use a lot of abilities. Holy paladin is quite low on abilities you can probably do well using only about 10 skills. Mage is also good, since they have so much control you can dumb down their kit and just use a fraction of it and still be successful
---
What solo content? You can grind mobs or gather nodes just fine as healer spec if that is what you are asking.
---
The is a good thing. Instead of saying “fuck it, ship it”, Blizzard wants Classic to be as solid as possible.
---
lol uh... hopefully not. Most of us were uni students or just out of school. Usually they would be polite and let us know: AFK, gotta take care of the girl.
---
Gotta get that streamer advertising before launch
---
You forgot the T, friend.
---
Lookin for Kupo or Mental on Shazzrah EU
---
I've never heard of the Class Trainer Plus before. I'll pick that up on release!
---
Yes I wanted deku but I'll settle
---
I didn't think I've have to start a blacklist this early, but I wrote 'em down. If I see 'em live I'll do my duty. o/ Will you be playing Grob, too?
---
We are getting a bunch of hardcore players who have been playing vanilla for the last 14 years. While we were playing other games and maybe even retail, they were busy theorycrafting. 
---
It seems like these are the same people who rushed rushed to form Discord groups as soon as server names were announced, to have some sort of control over the communities. It's about power. And from reading the chats in the Discord groups, it's obvious a lot of these people (not all) have the min/max holier than thou attitude because of their experience.
---
Hopefully they don't ruin the community aspect of the game that I loved back in the day. I am personally going to find people that want to take their time and enjoy the game for what it is instead of rushing to 60 and through raids because they've done it 200 times on illegal servers.
---
Classic is all I can think about and I still dont have beta access?
---
Finally they're showing some ads for it.  They've been so hush hush lately.
---
Hear!  Hear!
---
F the Horde
---
Why? it makes total sense they will start pushing advertisement for classic now, considering there has been very little before now.
---
Lol the doomsaying on this sub is fucking unreal.
---
That's what i thought about hunter, looked into hunter already because they're often recommended as a beginner class but they just look easy to level and farm, pvp with deadzone and endless kiting looks pretty hard. But they might be easy for big open world fights, just spam your shots from the back, but i guess any ranged class would be good in that situation...
---
Like someone else here said, it’s not really the streamer it’s the giant crowd of players. And small streamers don’t have to deal with that
---
I’m playing a ret paladin. If I don’t get groups that’s fine. I’ll just soc horde in world pvp and run dungeons where we are really sought after. The amount of utility we provide in 5 mans is more than enough to outweigh our lower dps. 
---
Also at the end of he day, dps isn’t the be all end all of classic raiding.
---
Working as much field overtime out of town as possible to accommodate the 3 weeks off I’m taking for launch
---
From my understanding it's not a horde heavy server, it's only like 5% off that 50/50 split. Herod is so big I would not doubt if there's a late night guild that fits your hours. 
---
The biggest problem for Herod rn is the population being too large and we'll see if that holds up but maybe you can talk your friends into playing Whitemane or something.
---

---
Somehow got my name..
---
woosh
---
That‘s cool. Means I can focus on my level 60 main
---
I knew someone back on vanilla that had a name that that started with N and ended in "ith" instead of the hard "er" if you catch my drift, until after level 40. So ya never know. I'm surprised that got through their screening during the name creation tbh
---
Yep, I need to confirm this info for myself
---
Pack it up, boys. Classic is dead.
---
They are probably just paying streamers to play and create some pre launch hype

Most of the pserver incorrections were *more* difficult than what we see in classic...
---
Whenever you decided to post it here probably
---
And I’m assuming you need an invite, correct?
---
Lootlag or too much has changed.
---
drool...
---
yeah sure ok
---
Already done that all but for A. But I can't do that since the tendie and fruitpunch supplies would be cut off. And my dad might say the J word.
---
Hunter wing clip spamming is NOT higher uptime than warriors spamming hamstring; both situations are a 3.5 swing speed with 1.5 GCD instant damage abilities.
---
&gt;we aren't even sure if Prot/Fury builds are going to be a thing yet.
---
Why not? Outside of enrage sit-critting, everything else about Warriors should be 99% accurate to Classic.
---
It makes sense in the context of the game now.
---
If you haven't played retail in 10 years then you wouldn't understand.
---
Are you never happy?
---
Their expansion betas for retail usually stay open until launch (sometimes even a little past launch, basically whenever they get around to closing it), there's no real reason to not keep it open as much as possible.
---
Jesus Christ what an edgy informed post.
---
No, you're the one being arbitrary. If it's the same content and the only difference is damage, health, and additional mobs then someone can perfectly exclaim the content is scaled to be harder. It won't be what people mean when they say "level scaling", but that's not the only instance the word scaling is allowed to be used. Imagine being this anal and gatekeeping the word scaling. I've missed the personalities on wow lol.
---
Warlock demon quests. Actually having to beat a demon into submission. Feels good man.
---
Where does she come up with all the money to buy everyone's garbage?
---
Hey u/EsfandTV  how bout that beta invite you promised me?
---
If you're into the shadow stuff and not into healing or holy at all, warlock, hands down. Shadow Priest feels like a dumbed down warlock with the ability to give up and heal eventually. (I played warlock main, priest alt back in vanilla).
---
&gt; WoW had its issues at launch and it did fine. So there's no reason to change it
---
we just have totally different standards it seems. if there is an issue, then let's fix it.
---
I don't know much about spain. Do they speak english in group chat?
---
Stoutbarrel, Dwarf Hunter.  I think it's a good Warcraftian/dnd pun name.  I'm proud of it.  
---
I got my usual usernames from other games too, but those aren't anything to brag about.
---
I got Ashley, Vb, Xp and Tv. Pretty happy with my haul.
---
You're welcome.  
---
The best way to do it is to set up interact with target on both windows and turn on click to move on your slave.  To do this go into the key bindings and then targeting menu and then scroll down until you find the interact with target option and set it to something like 'G' on both characters.
---
Then only on the slave go into the Interface menu and then the mouse menu.  Turn on the click-to-move option.
---
Now if there is a corpse you need to loot a quest giver you want to talk to target it on your main character and then hit your assist macro so your slave is also targeting it.  Then hit the G key (or whatever you set the interact with target keybind to) and both your characters should now interact with that item being it looting a corpse, talking to an NPC or even autoattacking a enemy.
---
The video was aimed to get my friend started on this and he is also asking me similar questions.  Before classic releases I will most likely do an advanced tutorial video including things like this :)
---
To be honest, all I've got are vague recollections from a decade ago at least.
---
I was the one responsible for most of the web / VoIP hosting back in the day and remember mumble's server being a nightmare to get running with anything but the default settings, mostly thanks to them wanting that single master server browser instead of just sharing ip/port like TS and Vent.
---
Speex really wasn't up to par with the proprietary codecs at the time and always sounded like it belonged on a 16-bit computer.
---
And the client ui was just a disaster from what I remember. Granted, that could be said for almost any open source project from the 00's.
---
Granted, Vent had it's share of problems. I always liked TS personally. I still miss a lot of the configurability that TS3 had.
---
People upvoting you here doesn't mean shit. How many in the community have you actually engaged with? You said yourself you're as white bread as it gets, so of course you've never run into any issues engaging in the online gaming community.  
---
If your voice doesn't sound 'standard' for the whitebread gamer boy, people will always question your voice so there is no hiding from that bullshit.   
---
OP doesn't want people to misgender her, so there should be zero issue telling people "Hey, I'm a woman so please use she/her pronouns for me." She 100% has a right to having people refer to her properly. She shouldn't have to put up with being misgendered just to scout the Guild out.  
---
It's really simple, when someone tells you they are trans all you gotta do is ask what pronouns they'd like used for them. That's all. No, "Eww gross!" No, insta-block for daring to be honest with you.   
---
Why the fuck do you people think it's okay that others have to hide what they are? We're not all generic white boys, thanks.
---
The only one upset here is you, I think. I'm not even rolling on Whitemane lol
---
I wonder what the honest number of people are who:              
---
A) Are unaware of Classic but watch WoW Classic Streamers.                   
---
                 
---
B) Know about Classic but were uninterested until they saw a Streamer playing.              
---
C) Just escaped their crazy parent's nuclear fallout shelter where they've been living for the past 20 years after a freak plane crash convinced them they had been attacked and upon seeing the internet the first thing they see is a streamer playing WoW CLassic and go "Oh gee Willikers that looks Neat-O, I wana do that!"                   
---
I honestly can't imagine the numbers are exactly staggering.
---
The biggest issues are server stability and leveling fast enough. That's literally it. All this other stuff people bring up is trivial. A few hours of dedicated grinding planned ahead of time.
---
Stop correcting someone for spewing bullshit?
---
I only reserved two names. Don’t know if you need one reserved but I can do it once I get off work.
---
something something streamer privileges
---
My wife and I rolled here earlier. Only 311 hours left!!
---
For the Layman how does one perform seal twisting?

Can you check the australia ones please?

interested to see if they are in melb or syd

---
I dont feel so good mr stark...
---
Also Paladin, I get it's alliance only but in classic (and I've already seen some mention online) ALL the blood elf fan boys (which make up a majority of wow) played human paladin. There's no way paladin will be one of the most uncommon classes come release.
---
Owyn- Gnome Warrior
---
Goldvein-Dwarf Priest
---
Atiesh
---
Laktos-Tauren Hunter

Grobbulus

It means the few Brazilian guilds on thalnos aren't gonna be fuckers like every other Brazilian and are going to blacklist the Brazilian fuckers

&gt; 4\. How does IP-based geolocation work?
---
ARIN Whois database provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration information for IP resources registered with ARIN. The IP whois information is available for free, and determining the country from this database is relatively easy. When an organization requires a block of IP addresses, a request is submitted and allocated IP addresses are assigned to a requested ISP.
---
IP addresses are assigned in a block to an organization/ISP.
---
whois query shows the 24.xx.xx.xx addresses registered in Irvine and the 137.xx.xx.xx addresses registered in the Netherlands.  That doesn't mean that's where the servers are physically located, of course.
---
If you played retail you would know that not every mob is killable at level 15 tho? Mobs only scale up, not down. Try going to the burning steppes as a level 15 in retail.
---
You said "nipped it in the butt".
---
Which sucks because I genuinely enjoy the art work for that ability. If it were useable in defensive stance I could see it being viable.
---
Actually slayer of the lifeless was the new name for wotlk Naxx and a reference to the episode, the classic naxx version had some other name I can’t remember, hungering cold I believe?

Depends when you try and log in.  First 5 minutes? May be u get lucky with low queue / no queue.  After that imo 1-3 or more hours of queueing is totally possible.
