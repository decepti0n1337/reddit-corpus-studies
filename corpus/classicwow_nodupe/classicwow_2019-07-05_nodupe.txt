You are presenting it like this is a new idea.

Or do you acknowledge this is almost an exact repost of dozens of other people?

---
&gt; They can switch servers at any time. 
---
THEY CANT SWITCH SERVERS IF THEIR FRIENDS ARE PLAYING. Sometimes i feel like this sub is dominated by solo players, seeing all these "which faction should i choose"-threads.  
---
Were talking about WoW Classic, THE game with the most forced socialization i can imagine nowadays. People are going to play with their friends/family/guildies/retailbuddies. If they cant login they wont start solo on a different server oO, what are you guys thinking? :O
---
I kinda hop it doesn't do "great". I just want to play Vanilla. Can't we just play Vanilla?
---
True-dat. (Though Ashkandi totally is, if you're a non-PvP guild. There's no reason for a warrior to have it for PvE reasons.)
---
A lot of people will pick a class strictly because they are strong in 1v1
---
Polying and eating/drinking was not allowed in vanilla wow. At least on my server it wasnt. Shadowmoon US PvP. I know this because I was a lvl 60 mage. Same with pots and engineering items.
---
Xfire
---
I'm not a fan of having every class be capable of everything - that's not the Classic way. But I'll be honest I'm not exactly the biggest fan of there only being 1 real capable talent build for most classes when it comes to raiding.
---
If there's a future where Blizzard continues with BC before deciding to keep evolving the game apart from WotLK I'd wish that they keep flying to the Outlands.
---
That way they could keep expanding Azeroth with ground mounts and if Blizz ever wants to go back there or another Planet they could design that expansion with flying in mind from the start, giving them space for creativity while keeping Azeroth the way it was.
---
Warcraft 3 was a standout because its graphics were much more strong, voice acting and imrpoved upon the previous system. Now, while the story was more intricate and involved than before, they've expanded upon the past lore in the last 15 years to where you can definitely have a heavy story prior to arthas. It just wouldn't be anything people remember because they didn't play it.
---
But, they're not trying to attract just warcraft fans, they're trying to get anyone that they can
---
I like Wrath, so I'll stick it out until cata
---
id have to say hunter because they are more dominant pvp-wise during leveling and also with less gear at 60. warlock is more of a main class because it is weak until it gets gear.
---
how are paladins like end game both pve and pvp? i am a casual now so i dont think i will hc raid. i am torn between paladin or warrior, love tanking. i used to have a 60 warrior in vanilla and played a paladin in wotlk.

Only on Reddit can I read how Nelf ilare the absolute worst, and then read the exact opposite in another post.  Haven't watched the video yet, will when I get home.  Hopefully it's not just trolling.
---
WoD, but I'd probably just stay on WotLK until MoP came out rather than move to Cata if I had the choice.
---
Have you tried /castsequence with reset timers?
---
I'm not sure what timing we'd want exactly for rotations, would need to play around with it, but something like;
---
/castsequence reset=6 Aimed Shot, Multi-Shot
---
There isn't much value to be gained from dredging up old reddit threads and talking on those, that isn't in line with the meta of reddit. 
---
The more these conversations are in the forefront of our communities, the better...or do you disagree?
---
&gt; No, you were pretending like you had an actual argument, got blown the fuck out, and now you're backpedaling.
---
He showed how you are wrong about leeway and you ignored it.
---
1.  This exact code was in Vanilla and that's reason enough to keep it as it is.
---
2.  Leeway was originally intended to improve the experience for people with poor ping, and plenty of people still have poor ping, even if you personally have better ping now.
---
3.  You're asking the devs to change what was actually in Vanilla because it would improve the experience for you personally even if it is detrimental to those people who have poor ping now.  You should realize how dumb an idea that is.
---
If you don't have the ability to understand the above, then that's your problem.  But the devs do understand it, which is why they've said leeway is working as intended.
---
Blizz doesn't have GMs for specific games.  All retail GMs are also Classic GMs.
---
&gt; What's your idea around random layer hops like we've seen some examples of? 
---
Hard to tell, blizz experimented A LOT on beta
---
&gt; It might sound alittle trivial, but it would kindoff suck. 
---
Randomly vanishing players/monsters in a world is a NIGHTMARE and HOPE i doesnt occur often.  
---
I have no answers to how layers exactly work. What happens when a new layer gets opened?  
---
Layer 1: 3000 Players  
---
Layer 2: 200 Players?  
---
That would feel weird to the Layer2 people, but you just cant pull 1400 Layer1 players out of their layer (so you got 1,6/1,6), that would break immersion. :(  
---
Again, i dont have an answer to that, i dont even have beta access. 
---
**We just gotta hope blizzard comes up with a working, TEMPORARY solution with very limited exploitability which gets removed ASAP.**
---
It's obviously not working or playing the same as it did in Vanilla.
---
I want it to play like Vanilla. It doesn't currently.
---
Yes it should be changed. Shocking.
---
You're such an unpleasant person, god I hope you don't end up on the same server as me.
---
Ping doesn't entirely depend on the distance. Will the distance affect ping? Sure but what also matters is how many hops (different routers) it needs to go through on the way to your destination. You can still live several hundred (or even thousands) of miles further than someone else from the server and still can have better ping based on the routing.
---
Back when I was student I lived on student dorms, we had internet that was basically just one hop away from the national backbone so my pings were much lower than they are right now. I live like 2 miles away from the dorms I used to live in and have much worse pings because I have regular consumer ISP and it takes me several more hops to reach the backbone.
---
I remember discussing CC and kill orders with dungeon groups, good times. Tol barad was also fun. I didn't raid during that expansion.
---
Blizz shouldnt go their traditional expansion route or this entire classic experience will be wasted. Players want to level capped. I know the experience and the possible fifteen+ /played days worth getting to cap in lvl , gear, and professions is what most hype but level cap is the reward. I want to be 60 for a long time. longer than i have been level capped in any iteration of the game. The move i predict blizzard is going to pull off is a type of system that imports your characters to a BC server and so on and so forth. This will allow for blizzard to have people paying for retail, classic, or the expansion 2.0 servers. Whatever the customer wants.
---
Then they wait. Their friends are obviously experiencing the same issues. Sometimes I feel this sub is dominated by people with a high time preference who have no respect for good game/world design.
---
&gt;The only factor now is your distance to where you're sending and receiving information.
---
No it isn't. The routing is a factor which can be more convoluted over a longer distance but that isn't always the case. 
---
Geography isn't always a direct factor either as some places can be geographically closer but further away from an "internet highway"
---
On another note, satellite internet is apparently a popular (or necessary) thing in parts of the US.
---
I've never been able to do that, lol. I can't focus on both.
---
Interesting. I honestly didn’t know this was against TOS
---
I never said anything about the timeline. But it WILL happen.

Jokes on you, there won’t be any hunters.

Omg I miss xfire, I wish it was still around, so much nostalgia there.
---
Yes we need layering.  Some of us who played back in the day have since moved out of our parenta basement and actually have a life.  We don't wanna spend hours in queue or fighting to tag mobs.
---
Then I guess downvote and move on.
---
Not a fan of pservers but I still appreciate the meme.

Gotta say, at least some pservers have their heart in the right place.

Probably this is the real answer.
---
Okay just to clarify I’m actually talking about vanilla ‘rules’ I’m not talking about whatever they are doing on the beta right now.
---
Exactly. I'd love to see the debuff limit removed personally, but the problem becomes 'who decides what gets removed?' and then you start a massive shitfight about what is and isn't worthy of being part of the Vanilla(tm) Experience.
---
Right. I recall Joana mentioning it also, but that’s from a speed-running perspective. I’m not sure if it’ll stay on Classic, but if Screech crazy aoe three stays, I’ll probably grab an owl again, train max armor, and get 2-3 mobs at a time, using multi shot. Saves some time grinding.
---
priests are A tier levelers and are not much more 'boring' than playing a warlock actually, both will dot and wand spam and priests will never have to eat/drink just like a warlock. just make sure you keep your wand current and you'll be sweet.
---
Sometimes while questing I'll find a spot, put down a campfire, turn the ambience up and then crack open a beer IRL and in game.
---
That’s something I have never noticed, but now that’s it’s pointed out I will always be looking at it
---
I also hate how "new content" always just means raids. Give us also other ways to get loot, catering to the 1% would suck. I loved crafting Thunder in TBC. It took a long time but I got a decent epic weapon without raiding.
---
Scatter did DR with Scatter in 1.12, but did not earlier. There are actual vanilla videos proving this (and also explains why there are other videos showing it not - because it was pre 1.12). Also, here is a forum post I found about hunter bugs on the official forums in 2006:  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060527102237/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-bugs&amp;t=53523&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post53523](https://web.archive.org/web/20060527102237/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-bugs&amp;t=53523&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post53523)

Under "*Not Bugs (****But sometimes thought to be****)*": "**Scattershot appears to be on the same diminishing returns as freeze trap in PvP."**
---
Is you opinion that a poll with 22000 voters is not reliable information? Did I understand that correct?
---
ya, hence me waiting for pantheon. I think everything everyone ever "wished" for is literally being designed in that game while also looking amazing and having decent progress in its creation. classic wow is gonna be great to play then its gonna have competition around when people want something added to improve the game
---
Its going to happen for the hardcore guilds that gather all world buffs and go with optimal setups (mostly warriors and rogues).
---
But for the other 95% it wont.
---
&gt; Every single reason I gave was in regards to THIS particular question. They are all specifically pertinent.....about THIS.
---
I guess I will repeat myself until either you stop ignoring the key issue, or you melt down entirely from denial and cognitive dissonance.
---
People have decompiled the 1.12 client and proved that what Blizzard said was true. How does that fit into your deranged conspiracy theory?
---
Yep, your last point there, It's hard to tell how it'll end up to be. I think that's why we've seen alot of this idea that OP posted because it effectively puts the control into the player's hands, as bad as that might end up to be. I think it's reasonable to be abit sceptic around this subject.
---
An idea could be to let players, by themselves, hop between layer's (on command) giving a cooldown, rather than having an automatic system. Though that comes with problems of its own.
---
However, it's probably a good idea to reserve some judgement untill Blizz lays out all the cards on how layering works, currently it's alot of guess work because of the experimentation phase. The next stress test should be a good indicator, I think.
---
With a conclusion like that one wonders why there is ever any form of delay at all.
---
Depends on what you mean by "correctly", if you mean "optimally for fastest boss kills" then sure.
---
For me "playing correctly" means "playing in a way that you enjoy". And for that playing oomkin is perfect!

Paladins are very strong, but the play style is kind of dull.  The fun part is aoe farming with block.

I usually go with a couple of tin cans connected with a string. (Green bean cans carry sound the best in case you're wondering)

Smoke signals can be another option, although can be distracting a bit during raids.

It's part of your identity, and a great deal of people (myself included) *want* that sense of consistent identity and community. If there's 20 Tauren's named Beefcake, and one Beefcake happens to be a complete asshole and ruins a pug run, how am I supposed to tell other people that? 
---
Should I just put out an APB saying 'Be on the lookout for Tauren Warrior, answers to Beefcake: one horn broken, black and white fur, no nose ring wearing red plate and dual wielding axes'? Just avoid everyone named Beefcake? Because I'm far too gay for that.

Summer of '05
---
u/attreu
---
I got my first real PC
---
World of Warcraft had arrived
---
Played it 'til my fingers bled
---
Was the summer of 2005
---
​
---
My and some guys from school
---
We had a guild and we tried real hard
---
Jimmy quit, Jody got burnt out
---
I should've known we'd never get far
---
Oh, when I look back now
---
That summer seemed to last forever
---
Grinding mobs in Stranglethorn Vale
---
Yeah, we were on a great endeavour
---
Those were the best days of my life
---
Ain't no use in complainin'
---
When you've got professions to do
---
Spent my evenings down at the Blacksmith
---
And that's when I met you, yeah
---
Standin' in the Burning Steppes
---
You told me that you'd play forever
---
And when you /flirt with me
---
I knew that it was now or never
---
Oh, yeah
---
Back in the summer of 2005, oh
---
Man, we were killin' time, we were young and restless
---
We needed to unwind
---
I guess nothing can last forever, forever, no
---
Yeah
---
And now the times are changin'
---
Look at everything that's come and gone
---
Sometimes when I play the current retail
---
I think about WoW, wonder what went wrong
---
Standing at the Lumbermill
---
Hoping to MC some noobs
---
Oh yeah,
---
It was the summer of 2005, oh, yeah
---
Me and my guildies in 2005, oh
---
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of 2005, yeah
---
Of all the issues right now I think the big delay on spell batching is what worries me the most. Someone was saying everything was somewhat delayed and laggy feeling, using skills, the UI, pets, etc.
---
Reckoning though.
---
Who?
---
That poll yes. Its not the number of voters that makes it in unreliable, it's the pool of voters. It's also not an opinion it's a factual statement. If you wanted to say that shaman would be a popular pick among classic redditors then that's a reasonable conclusion. The OPs assertion just isn't a viable conclusion from the data.
---
I hope it gets fixed. Good catch.
---
Yes, i recently played my first D&amp;D campaign &lt;3.  
---
I see your point but i dont think its accurate to compare an online MMORPG with an offline tabletop RPG.
---
  
---
The thing is, while youre sitting in queue for endless hours/days: **Youre missing out.** People are already progressing on your server, your friends are leveling and you cant catchup. This makes the game feel UNFAIR to them. What youre comparing to is servers being offline for hours/days, which happened quite often back then. Yes, it was frustrating but not that bad cause nobody got to play.  
---
I agree:  In 2004 World of Warcraft had an ABSOLUTELY INSANE world/game design. The graphics/design of this game were YEARS ahead of any game out there back then. But this is why i compared it to Wildstar. Wildstar had an insane design aswell containing a huge world, beatiful graphics, amazing profession systems and interesting class flavor and mechanical depth. But it wasnt catered to casuals. It even advertised with that mentality because there was a lot of "wow got too casual"-talk going around back then. Wildstar shut down its servers last year and its a damn shame.
---
* No error message when trying to teach pet more than 4 spells.

* Macros for Aspects must be altered slightly.

* When your pet dings, it's not the correct blue color.
---
* And so on...
---
Doomed? Give me a break... The only reason that list is so long is that even the most mundane shit is put on there.
---
Make a list with only the TRULY gamebreaking bugs. The stuff that would TRULY ruin your Classic experience. Not that your pet ding visual is the wrong blue colour.
---
Such a hilarious and fun event. It obviously had it's problems, but most of them were out of their hands and just trolls ruining the fun.

---
I've been a resto shaman main for years I'm worried about the upcoming Shaman hypetrain.
---
Good one? lol
---
Has anyone considered that the existence of the spell queue window could exacerbate this further? In 2005 if you wanted to shave off latency, you had to manually cast within that window, and doing it too early would cancel the cast entirely. With the spell queue window, the last ability pressed within the set threshold (default 400ms IIRC) will be considered to have been pressed as soon as the last ability fired. Wouldn't this make it even more of a sure thing that a skilled player could squeeze into the batch they wanted to?
---
I agree, although there are plenty of things discovered on private servers that were possible back then.
---
&gt;every asshole streamer
---
Whoa there.
---
This is a legit bug that is also easy to fix.  I'm glad someone is bringing it up.
---
Are you sure the cap is removed in Classic though?
---
Can you all keep your hands off so the prices stay down and I can actually afford. Ty
---
People are stupid enough to claim ret paladins are good because of Esfand, so I don’t think ele shamans will be a problem.
---
The list there isn't really the point of the image. The point of the image is hunter's current state in pvp. With leeway and trap/scatter/sleep DR, even maybe rocket helm DR with them, and able to completely avoid traps either with leeway or due to the movement updates, feign death not working at all in bgs/being unreliable in open world, and maybe more show how different it will be. Sure, the scatter+trap DR thing is big, but proven to be vanilla. But sleep also DR with it? rocket helm? what else DRs with it? And blind doesn't DR with its own self? Like c'mon.  
---
The list was made and been maintained for me personally to track the progress of everything related to hunter that seems off, like I said before. I honestly didn't intend anyone else to use it really but it's become much bigger than I expected.  
---
The fact that there are so many little things not only takes away from the look and feel of hunter, but also just shows how many things are wrong. There isn't any other class that is nearly as bugged. Sure, some stuff can go unnoticed. Most hunters won't even notice half the bugs listed unless you were coming straight from vanilla.  
---
It's not just the list though. I mean it's a precedent for the overall beta. Some of the things I've helped create the report on are stuff like ranged attacks not being blocked at all, or the instant attack normalization using legion values. Like how do things like that slip through the cracks? It's clear to me that their reference client wasn't exactly used as a reference until after the fact. There could be an insane amount of little stuff that we might not ever notice due to the way they ported it.
---
clearing a normal mode raid on retail is 100 times harder than doing naxx 40 and I doubt only 5% clears the raids on normal in retail, even when you take into consideration that retail has more types of content people can engage in outside of raids. In vanilla it's literally only raidlogging and pvping if you account share I guess.
---
You keep saying exploit. It's not an exploit.
---
Wait so the polls got debunked so now your saying pirate servers = classic wow? Getting desperate
---
Neat!
---
try lvl 60s with different gear to understand class abilities .it really doesnt matter with this min maxing 1v1 duels with rules at those levels. if anyone choosing because of that , its a potato reason and most likely they gonna get disappointed .  ( also he got the casters , which shaman can delete hem due to low health and purge   )
---
[deleted]
---
Hilarious
---
I just wish they'd think this through long term. What's the point of following the same schedule? Like will we have BFA classic in like 10 years? Imo rereleasing expension while not repeating the same mistakes would be great. I mean the controversial points of each expansions are pretty obvious (like flying mounts in TBC) so imo they should do what you described, but do community polls on what to do about the most controversial aspects of each expansion.
---
The vast majority of Mages, probably like 95%, wont level faster than Hunters, but sure, that one Mage that levels faster due to literally not going to sleep completely invalidates everything the you replied to said.
---
So what? The server will be maxed out instantly and with Mages being such a popular class the aoe spots will be instantly taken. Mages are in no way shape or form better at questing than Hunters.
---
Why wouldn't they be? Every layer will essentially be maxed out, so why would you just be able to hop layer and find an empty spot? Doesn't take more than one Mage for a spot to be taken.
---
Show us on the doll where to Moonkin touched you...
---
Honestly, it probably helped that I was a big wow fan but didn't really follow the lore in wow or even Warcraft 1-3. It just felt amazing to nerd out watching orcs and humans go at it in such a big way. Storyline was secondary but still vaguely familiar and cool enough to suspend disbelief and just enjoy. I'll be hyped if they ever announce a sequel.
---
One notable difference for mages between +Frost Damage and +Spell Damage is that +Frost actually also increases the amount of damage your Ice Barrier can absorb.
---
The more you know
---
Haha.  Oh geez
---
Weapon skills is an integral part of my unique build, the Muscle Priest. Verily I will smite thee and I don't mean with the spell.

&gt;i dont think u got any ability which favors attack speed yet.

Nah only the main ability you know Sinister Strike? LOL
---
I’m in my 30s. Hoping to play it my kids
---
those tiny dragon pictures everywhere is both adorable and hilarious
---
It's not in the Beta.
---
What polls have got debunked? They all show similar results. In fact, p-servers are the one that show Shamans lower you buffoon.
---
Yeah, gl with that. You clearly have no idea how layering works. One layer will have around the population of a vanilla server, so gl randomly finding an empty layer (hint: they won't exist).
---
I won't be playing with any, they aren't allowed in any guild I have ever been a part of as far as vanilla goes, so I don't really care.  I'm trying to save new players from making a mistake when they open up this sub and think playing moonkin is a good idea.
---
Gnomes have better beards than Dwarfs IDGAF what anyone says!
---
No. You are arguing that using the buffs in raid is akin to jumping the fence that was clearly not meant to be jumped.  I am arguing that it is not exploitative in any way to drop some buffs and use them. I am providing similar examples of "shady" things that blizzard has outright stated are not exploits to prove that point. 
---
The goblin rocket boots are being used to access portions of the map you were not meant to. This is clearly an exploit. Getting buffs before raid?? Not even close.
---
No, I'm not.
---
Layering means you can jump between these realms, these would be locked until they merge once the populations spread out a little bit.
---
Whatever they do, i don't really care though.
---
All I want to do is push to lvl60 as fast as I can and see how I compare to others on a fresh release. Then I'll probably quit, too many other good games releasing this year.
---
We both have the same info on layering, they may or they may not. More people will be in live than in beta and we already saw 10+ layers at a time for arena trinket, so hint: they already exist.
---
literally unplayable
---
Yes, one or two or a few mages, but for anyone that hasn't practiced a fucking aoe route and manages to get ahead of everyone (99% of the Mages) it won't be faster than Hunters. At the extreme Mages are faster, but 99% of the players won't be able to level faster than Hunters since there simply isn't enough aoe spots.
---
Chill dude.

---
More like it's just a reference to the battlefield itself... Not sure how the song enters into it
---
Oh fair enough, I was mistakenly thinking that you meant the duel tourney.  
---
    
---
As for regular duels it's still anything goes imo, if someone doesn't like potion use then he can just not duel. It's not anyone but his problem if he doesn't have the funds or doesn't want to spend money or time on consumables - the "no pots" thing is just an arbitrarily imposed rule that means nothing.
---
It’s just a game... breath... and let people play how they want. Min/maxing and end game raiding isn’t the only reason people play classic.
---
Have you been on a full server before? There are alot of strain that happen at peak hours that have a range of problem caused by it.
---
IIRC Rockard was destroyed and then rebuilt as Dreadmaul Hold.
---
This seems to be a common rebuttal to anyone criticizing any fantasy movie. Not every fantasy movie should be a “turn off brain and insert popcorn” type of movie, and not every is trying to be.
---
Warcraft had action, but it mostly tried to focus on the story between the Orcs infighting and fighting the humans, and the humans trying to figure out what to do, and a shoe-horner romance plot point. The problem is that when youre trying to focus on story and have shittt writers and actors then it just doesnt work. 
---
If Warcraft was trying to just be yet another fantasy action-flik, we wouldve just seen Guldan invading The EK and the fight against him, not all the other subplots and attempted emotional resonence. 
---
Handwaving shitty writing by saying “oh it was just an fantasy flick so it doesnt have to make sense” is as much of a copout as when someone says something stupid and says “i was just joking” when called out for being stupid. 
---
Just because its fantasy doesnt mean it gets a pass on being bad, just look at r/freefolk

you'll go through a couple stacks of 20 [insert food item] that it desires in order to raise it's loyalty to a safe enough level that it doesn't jet on you right away

Hint: the beta was them testing layering. But I get it, this sub loves to take everything at face value and not actually account for the fact that it says "beta". Layering changed over the course of the beta but let's just ignore that so the narrative stays intact. If you think layers like those in the beta will exist in release you're in for a nasty surprise if that's how you're planning stuff.
---
I treat people the way I want to be treated, playing on a PvP server I never gank, but I like that it can happen to me even if I wouldn't do it to someone else. It adds another layer to the game.
---
Go back to when I completely debunked the poll and that's when you went to pirate servers as if they are the same population as classic wow will be.
---
If you want to only level through questing you can't do it, not enough experience. But if you are fine with grinding the missing XP it's entirely possible, there are zones and quests covering every level range, just not a lot of quests.
---
TBC was great, but flying sucked, and I can't return to the no-lifer mode that it requires. 
---
Classic+ would be legit if they didn't repeat the mistakes of the past (looking at you flying mounts).
---
naxx 40 is basically raid finder difficulty, half the raid can have the tank on /follow and you'll do just fine...
---
I’d hop off with wrath. I played all of that one, I’m missing cthun, naxx and sunwell. Did all the other content on current heroic/hardmode up to WoD.
---
Again, me and you have literally the same info unless you're a Blizz dev. We don't know, co you coming in there like "you clearly have no idea..." neither do you, its all speculative. We've seen it work with a lot of layers, we've yet to see it be only a few layers. Maybe it will be maybe it wont be.
---
If you are not a troll you are a very pathetic person...
---
How required are hunters for raids? To remove boss enrage and stuff?   
---
Will hunters become the new in-demand class because less people will play them now?
---
It’s insane.
---
Definitely, Discord is so easy to use.
---
Its assuming 1.7 speed for sinister striking with daggers.
---
Naturally slower weapons have a higher base damage than faster weapons though, which is what makes them better.
---
So if I'm rolling undead but want to ride a raptor, should I just run to Durotar at level 1 and start questing there?

---
Assuming that TBC and WotLK servers will simply be a transfer system is pretty baseless.
---
More likely is that ALL servers get pushed to TBC and they open up one Vanilla-only server for those diehards to transfer to and be forgotten.
---
That will be true at first. But there will be enchanting power levelers eventually. So the value of the mats will increase over time.
---
I would definitely pick the least populated server and hoard resources until the servers merge, and inflate the prices like damn crazy.
---
IT'S MA'M
---
Yeah, if they release TBC servers, then the entire playerbase will be converted. They *might* open up one legacy server per continent and allow the diehards to transfer to and be forgotten.
---
True, if you're a lock/paladin i can see this being a good option, otherwise you'll struggle for mount at 40.
---
Focus on the environment, not the UI. Add-ons such as quest helper are strictly forbidden. Wowhead should only be used for quests in rare circumstances.
---
Also, make sure to have looping music enabled in game.
---
Tauren F Spriest is better
---
This is hilarious. Nice catch dude
---
Yeah. The outsourcing of white collar work to third world countries has been a perennial threat for about three decades now. It goes in cycles. They send a chunk to India. The Indians do not do it correctly and they find it administratively more difficult to do it there rather than here. So then they bring it back. Then four years later there is new managers who didnt learn the lesson yet of how ineffective it is.
---
Now automation is a real threat. But by the time they can fully automate professions where judgment calls can be made, literally no job in the world will be safe and we will all be expendable. Which will cause different issues.
---
I would still say that accounting at the manager level and above will be safe for the next Ten years. Which is enough time that people entering the field now should be safe. The stuff at the bottom continues to be outsourced or automated but simultaneously the stuff that is being performed, especially by the financial services companies is becoming more and more complicated, and faster and faster. So the need for people to be working with to the machines in control functions to check the more complicated things being created by people using more and more complicated machines might increase the need for labor
---
Cb prep and improved sprint all in one build?
---
Many people in this thread are full of shit, yourself included. "Shameful"? "Meaningless"? You really need to come back down to earth if you want to be taken seriously. 
---
To the final point: the history of discourse only names people who added value for a reason. That last sentence in particular is the pathetic standard defense of the common troll. Furthermore, if you cared to read what I actually posted I didn't even say "do it better", I said "add value". That means literally anything besides an unfounded brainfart such as "this is meaningless", because it is self-evident that is not. 
---
I hope you understand that people like you are the reason this could never become a discourse to begin with. You didn't criticize, you simply enjoyed taking someone down. Your entire fucking point boils down to "his baseline value was too high". Big deal, faced with shitty data that can happen. So plug in a lower value of your liking, run the numbers, and present the results. No? Right, too much effort to calculate three formulas. Better exercise your right to keep shouting. 
---
You seriously can't be surprised about the response this kind of behavior incites.
---
&gt;People have decompiled the 1.12 client and proved that what Blizzard said was true. 
---
No they haven't.  Stop spreading lies.

Oh shit, you're right. My colorblindness tricked me on this one. Sorry about that.

TCG mounts have been added in the TBC-Prepatch, so it doesn't really belong there.
---
Nothing, they're BoU meaning you can have someone buy them on discount for you and trade them, as long as both can trust each other with that much gold at least.

Dunno why you bothered. It's on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3McPVq1RT8F2ERSiajR3WS) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQFOLOur1jM) and can be pirated. Blizzard gave the soundtrack away with all Collector's Edition purchases back in 2004.
---
Servers won’t be able to be hosted in France (like most of the big ones haven been/are) anymore though so...
---
After Classic, honestly. I went through all of them and stopped at the beginning of Cata. I was missing Vanilla during TBC's heyday and only went through Wrath because of my guild, how popular WoW was, and to see a conclusion to the Arthas story. I've no interest in going through all of the expansions again.
---
No kidding. Seems like the barrens alone is larger than some modern AAA game’s entire maps.
---
I hated it in ICC, having to run that entire place on normal and then again on heroic back to back to maximize gear upgrades wasn't great, especially after Ulduar. It was still a great raid overall but it just felt weird.
---
The only one here demonstrating cognitive dissonance here is you.

I don't know about you guys, but the main reason I want BC is because they fix gameplay, class balance, itemisation, and stuff like that. Outland itself I'm not a huge fan of, but I'm really excited to be able to play a "fixed" version of vanilla WoW. Back in the day I quit early in BC (moved away from my parents, so lost computer access).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9a1na/ill_be_rolling_a_horde_rogue_at_launch_and_would/). 
---
This could be the dumbest post yet
---
&gt;Their stated intention is to use the original whenever possible.
---
Ok but again they're including things like updated graphics just because, why not? But then they're going to include a completely unnecessary dial-up era ping compensation method even though basically no one's using the type of internet that needs it now? And it's not going to save people with terrible internet anyway?
---
And yeah the satellite internet is the unusable variety I was referencing. It's not viable. Cellular data, if it's in a decent reception area can actually get pings generally underneath what base server ping will be so it's actually quite usable, definitely better than dial up at least. If you're in a bad reception area and resigned to use it, I would imagine it'd be nigh-unusable like the satellite internet is. But yeah, I've actually played League of Legends with cellular internet before, it's actually not that bad. I'm sure there's less to process with League than there is in WoW, but still, accurately pinging player locations shouldn't be an issue outside of mass PvP.
---
&gt;We cant have a perfect recreation of Vanilla, but we also shouldnt change things that we could potentially keep the same... 
---
But that's the main point of people being against it, it could only be the same with leeway if we were on the same shitty internet types of yesteryear. With the vast majority of people actually interested, it's going to be clearly absurd. Leeway is going to make it less like the real deal rather than more because of outside factors.
---
&gt;especially when changing it would hurt the experience for some players.
---
I'm still unconvinced we're talking about more than single digit, perhaps even sub 1% of the player base (at least as far as NA is concerned). Another thing is that straight ping numbers (like how you mentioned broadband doesn't necessarily equate to great ping) aren't the only relevant factor. The thing about dial up wasn't just that the ping sucked. In fact, the ping was probably the least-bad thing about dial up, though ofc it wasn't particularly good. It was the volume of data that could be moved at a time.
---
Playing with dial up was basically like playing on a server that was getting some moderate ddos attacks, packets took a while to go through because the connection didn't have a good data load. This matters a lot more that raw ping in terms of the server updating positions. It was basically the opposite of satellite internet, where with satellite the problem is pretty much just the ping because the ping is just that egregious (like 1,500-3,000 in my experience), whereas downloading stuff wasn't as much the problem.
---
The fact that this is almost certainly a thing makes me sad for humanity.
---
Hot
---
I did not know this, my Classic hype has intensified
---
you could do it on retail as well, it was just a much smaller window so you couldn't do it as consistently as on private servers. But with classic using the legion or bfa client, it's not gonna be possible.
---
There's no such thing as a streamer server, just a server that none of the toxic streamers are allowed.
---
Many shaman babies were made yesterday during that tournament.
---
&gt; Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to. 
---
Oops, I asked a question you can't answer.
---
On the beta it's currently less so if only 1 person is moving but still adds leeway none the less.
---
Or moonbrook
---
Weren't the AV mounts bought with battleground marks of honor at some point in vanilla? I had the mount and I remember grinding the rep but I doubt I could have afforded 800g.
---
What does this mean? Why wouldn’t you be able to join the server?
---
So he'll literally get everything!
---
that weapon is fine up to lvl 10, even the second dagger you get from your starting area quests are good enough. Just get to lvl 10 fast and get your [Blade of Cunning](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7298)
---
&gt;/cast [@pet,dead] Revive Pet; 
---
Conditional macros weren't added until 2.0.3
---
Yet, you don't have an argument as to why it's not an exploit.
---
You could just as easily without any changes take the already existing tools to make the best of these specs. Elemental shamans are low key incredible even in pve. They take very specific gearing and have large power spikes. In top end naxx they are more than capable of sustaining max rank LB for an entire fight and doing good dps. Nothing like a fire mage, but still very capable.
---
Instead of complaining about specs use your brain and push what a spec is capable of with their existing toolkit.
---
Remind me! 20 years
---
Not in the version we are playing in. It got added at one point though, I think it was TBC Prepatch?
---
You know what never gets old?
---
Pirate server babies thinking that their no-lifing on fake warcraft servers was a public service or something.
---
Remind me again what's an exploit?
---
Because as far as I know using something the Devs put in the game to be used to do something else doesn't fall under that category.
---
Sure they make the content easier, guess what? So do buffs, consumables, better gear, class stacking, where do you draw the line? 
---
Plus, when they stopped people from using world buffs they did so only for people 64+. Just because they didn't want people to farm or raids in order to do new expansion content. They never had any problem with people using vanilla buffs for vanilla content.
---
&gt;!***SHOW IT***!&lt;
---
Private server mob attribute scaling was too high at low levels but supposedly converges to the real Classic values as you get closer to 60, so the facerollness should hopefully gradually disappear by then.
---
Yes, and what about those areas required flying beyond accessing the area in the first place? Was flying really integral to the gameplay experience of Ogri'la, or was it just an arbitrary thing to gate access to the zone?
---
I don't know how to respond to that when it has nothing in it?
---
You’re still missing the point, not everyone wants the most sought after, optimal, viable spec or even wants to join a guild... like it or not, Moonkins are one of 27 specs. People will play it, some will love it and some will hate it. You last statement is categorically false, they are helpful to a multitude of people but you are so damn dense, you’ll still come back with a pointless retort.
---
I quit playing hunter in vanilla because of the amount of bugs/problems that kept happening with my pet
---
Furious in the background shirtless with the traindriver hat had me in fucking stitches when i was 13
---
the /world chat was up and running during the stress test. was talking to people on the other continent with it.
---
Dishonorable kills killed world pvp.
---
Both players have their own lag so you'd be adding them all together even 2 players with 100ms would have atleast 200ms between them
---
Yet, you don't have an argument as to why it's not an exploit. Getting 50% raid dps and 30% raid health is obviously not meant to happen either. Breaking pve content isn't meant to happen either.
---
I've seen Skarem get pushed through his phases so fast the clones bug out and disappear. They were in AQ gear.
---
Then you have the DW tanking bullshit. Clearly not meant to be that way.
---
Splitting 40 man raid in half to get 2 clears, because your raid dmg is insane.
---
Healing regen doesn't matter anymore, because the boss dies so fast that healers and casters cant run oom.
---
The game is totally broken with all the buffs.
---
Have they fixed leeway yet?
---
Sweeping Strikes
---
You can think of Consecrate like a dot applied to a circle on the ground. It ticks away like a normal dot and anyone who enters the area is "afflicted" by the dot, i.e. eligible for the damage it is ticking, but those damage ticks are still at static intervals. Blizzard's the same but obviously channeled instead of over time. Think of it like a Mind Flay that has infinite casting range but 40 yard damage range. Someone could start the cast on you, but you could juke in and out of range ("afflicted") and dodge the actual ticks.
---
For Horde, I'd say orc too. Rogue trinket doesn't include stun and you've got a whole extra class with a long-duration stun to worry about while the stun resistance has some anti-rogue power just like improved stealth does.
---
This seems to work, yes. Also works with shorter reset times
---
For warrior it's awful for PvP, but you can do a perfectly fine job tanking in a spec like that. Might actually be better for dungeon tanking than the cookie cutter tank spec.
---
You're doing yourself a disservice when you keep mentioning stuff that has been proven to be vanilla, in debates about bugs.
---
A feign death+trap macro will easily fix your second point. All of your other points I remember were a part of vanilla. If something was changed with a later patch in vanilla then it more than likely will be in classic. Every class has their own issues to deal with, it’s just part of it. There is not one class that is perfect with no issues or quirks to work around. If your wanting things changed from what they used to be then classic may not be for you.
---
I'll buy her wares. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You realize that there is a stat budget based on ilvl, right?  You can't just "double the stamina" and keep it the same ilvl, that isn't how the formula works.
---
&gt; Players being able to run over freezing traps if moving fast enough, due to how movement ticks work
---
I could be wrong, but based on my knowledge of tbc arena this seems incorrect to me, i recall traps being almost impossible to avoid even if you were lagging super bad and "teleporting" over them.
---
i suspect the issue is from them batching everything together when there should probably be different priority ques for things like feign death or traps (same thing applies to mage blizzard).
---
Why not?
---
Yet somehow people have managed to play Vanilla private servers with zero new content additions.
---
A real rogue dont need MoD
---
People say nelves are terrible just as rogues, or all the classes? Because if people can't figure out how useful shadowmeld is as the classes that don't have stealth, all I can say is git gud.
---
Probably correct, but since this is the legion engine, this macro works
---
Seems like a pretty viable trade off since you'd have all the handicaps of an underpopulated server until the (perhaps not necessarily 100% inevitable) server merge. 
---
What if the merge never *needed* to happen perse.
---
Bro, you’re my hero. I have this saved. 
---
I’ve been playing boomkin since right before TBC came out. Can’t wait to give it the old college try in classic!
---
Although I appreciate the effort they put in to organize it, it REALLY did not go well.   First off they said it was going to start at 11am PST.  The first duel didn’t happen until 2 hours later!  The down time between the duels was excessive too.  No way this should have taken over 8 hours.  I wanted to watch the whole thing but lost interest halfway.  The location they chose had terrible lighting and terrain and It was constantly griefed. So much so that they had to change locations ....to a spot with so many trees and foliage it was hard to see what was going on.  And do I even need to mention the hilariously bad “cardboard box with a sharpie” method of following the bracket.  Could anyone even read that?   Like I said I appreciated the effort , but I really hope they learned some things from it because IMO there is HUGE room for improvement.
---
How are battlegrounds and leveling a competing interest? 
---
If you want to do Spriest +something. A soul link warlock would benefit greatly from shadow vuln stacks, pve and pvp. More than one priest suffers from:
---
Can’t stack shields, can’t stack renews, blackout, silence, scream DR will be intense.
---
The dream
---
I love these maps on my phone so I can look over the world while I wait for August.
---
Looking at the map, it might be a bit misleading to say Thousand Needles and Badlands are Horde territory considering there are a number of quests in both those areas for Alliance.
---
I see the justification of calling them a horde, but not entirely accurate.
---
Neat picture of r/classicwowplus
---
Traps have an arming time, without scatter people can just walk away from it before it triggers.
---
You mean that picture of TBCs sweet ass features like flying badge vendor catch up gear and 25 man raids?
---
&gt;with minimal hurdles for everyone involved
---
Just you know... the hurdle of finding a name not taken not only on your own realm, but all same-type realms by the millions of characters that never get logged into after a month.
---
If you think Hunter DPS is good boy are you in for a rude awakening come Classic.
---
&gt; Also why the fuck would you scatter then feign death? You can just feign death and trap, you know.
---
If you actually played hunter, you'd know that feign-&gt;trap is extremely inconsistent.
---
Scatter'ing beforehand makes it so the enemy cannot damage you to put you back in combat before you trap.
---
&gt; Ok but again they're including things like updated graphics just because, why not?
---
I believe that's less of a change and more of an artifact of the modern architecture that they're using.  And as I understand it, you can use the original Vanilla graphics (the water, for example) if you want.
---
&gt; But that's the main point of people being against it, it could only be the same with leeway if we were on the same shitty internet types of yesteryear.
---
For people who had low ping in Vanilla, it should be the same.  For people who have high ping now, it should be the same.  I showed that a significant number of potential players will have high ping.  And the point of leeway is so that you don't have to tell potential customers that their internet is too shitty to play the game, so it moves the window of viable internet further toward the low end.
---
But it comes down to this:  I'm not going to selfishly say "I have better ping, so we should change the game from what it was to make the game better for me personally, even though it hurts other players".  Maybe changing it would hurt a lot of players, or maybe it would hurt few players, or something in between.  As a philosophical stance though, the exact number doesn't matter.  After all, changing the game to add guild banks would hurt zero players and be good for every player, but we still aren't doing that either.  So making a change that *would* hurt some players and wouldn't benefit everyone doesn't make sense either.

I've raided on private servers and I agree with you but please don't use private servers as examples for things. Find Blizzard owned examples.
---
STACK ON THE FUCKING SURGER!
---
Just because it worked that way in 1.12 doesn't necessarily mean it was correct. Vanilla is infamous for having shitloads of bugs and glitches.
---
Go Browns!
---
Youre bad
---
Again, those are entirely your opinion and entirely subjective. The "original WoW feel" means different things to different people. If the things you listed were the only things that made WoW Classic, then why are so many people arguing about such minuscule details of the game like Spell Batching and Leeway? Why do so many people care about things like the original shadows, and there being too much foliage on the ground by default?
---
Who are you to tell someone that WoW Classic is still the same when you want to change one of the biggest parts of it?
---
Those aren't merges, they're realm clusters of low pop realms that are interconnected, my characters are still on Scilla, but I also see people from Ursin, Zuluhed and some other server I can't remember.
---
They did not, until 1.12 where they were bugged to do so briefly. It was fixed in the tbc pre-patch.
---
BC all day.  I'd quit real life to play BC again.
---
I think it's worth adding a note about keeping a set of healing gear. Moonglow and Nature's Grace are very good for healing. You also need 13 points in the Resto tree to take Reflection for max DPS, so you might as well pick up Improved Healing Touch along the way.
---
I plan on recruiting a Moonkin in Classic under the condition that he keeps a set of healing gear on him and is ready to heal if asked. The plan is to only ever have 1 healing Druid at any given time and any other Druids are either Feral or Balance. Some of the Feral/Balance Druids would swap to healing on fights where we benefit from multiple sets of HoTs.
---
I wouldn't do it while raiding but just grinding furbolgs for a couple hours with a movie on is cool
---
I mean, ironforge is the best alliance city anyway, so no reason not to play a dwarf or gnome tbh.
---
Steam chat
---
Fur dur Hurd!
---
Still good for a middle-schooler though.
---
I mostly agree with you. BC was my favorite iteration of WoW and its not even close. I guess I was just trying to shoehorn my personal desires into the spirit of classic.
---
Do you want people that can push high rank (arena or bgs, we are in hypothetical mode rn) get an edge on you in pve ?
---
Yes, and when they don't have an enemy they will scapegoat a new one, or jump servers to harass streamers on *their* native servers. 
---
I hope this is a gag and not some extra chromosome legion, for everyone's sake.
---
In Coalition this is how I was utilized towards the end of Nost's life span. I would heal on trash and dps on bosses for our speed runs. In hindsight, to better optimize the raid you wouldn't do this, but we had to work with what resources we had.
---
But they are in the beta, making kiting mobs more aids since they attack from way further away
---
I ran Baron so damn much and finally gave up on ever seeing it. My farm group did another run without me after calling it quits and it fucking dropped. Everyone had crap rolls except the PuG guy who replaced me that was on one of his first runs and got it.

Hunter dps is shit

You said between 20 and 200 ms depending on geographical location. To even get 200 ms to European servers, you need to be like, living in Singapore or something, in which case I question why you'd even play on European servers instead of Oceanic.
---
Duno what auto squelch is but I fully expect to get revenge reported
---
BC. I want to see stuff added past Naxx in Azeroth, lvl cap still 60.
---
Definitely easier, but the way the expansions were built basically ruin past expansion content. TBC made being in Azeroth mostly pointless and screwed up world PVP with flying. It would be nice if they could expand on Azeroth and keep old content still meaningful to complete alongside the new. 
---
I would still be happy with TBC classic, but if they do that I hope they have them be separate servers. I also like the idea of them making TBC servers start you at level 60 and just focus completely on you being in Outlands, and if you want to be playing in Azeroth you jump on vanilla servers.
---
It should definitely be changed for classic. It barely existed in vanilla period, may have actually just been a bug, and was rectified at the beginning of BC. I don't know why you're so certain it isn't actually a bug. It wasn't documented in the same way as their other DR changes. Hunter is an absolute mess in classic regardless and it has soured me entirely on playing one. 
---
On an unrelated note, it seems like people are bitter about their dumb change ideas being rejected and are now "NO CHANGES" as long as it makes the game worse.
---
Yep it was a TBC thing. A few AV wins and you got an epic mount, really kinda dwindled the hard work it took buy one.
---
Idk how many players can be in a server and what not
---
Lizard person uses affluenza excuse. It’s super  effective!
---
These are not hard to implement, Blizzard is no longer operating out of grandmother's garage.
---
Five people right-click report you for "harassment" or "spamming". Suddenly you're disconnected and when you log back in, you're silenced and can't communicate with anyone. On retail people have been squelched for months since it doubles each time with no limit.
---
They will never calm the conerns. People and mobs will always teleport in and out with this type of server tech. It is essentially a copy of the ESO megaservers. 
---
It is honestly nothing like old classic servers and will greatly take away from the experience. Oh well we knew they would mess it up.
---
The system originated from EverQuest created by Thott from the guild afterlife. Same guy who created ThottBot. First two raid bosses in the game were dragons, so the name was fairly straight forward. I remember using the system in my EQ raiding guild back in ~2002, so it's been around for awhile. At least in WoW you cant de-level from dying during a raid and miss out on earning some DKP!
---
Phase 1 BIS Balance Druid buffed is 5344 mana as Alliance.  
---
That is \~55 seconds of casting assuming \~20% crit, without Mana Spring, Mana Tide, Judgement of Wisdom, or Blessing of Wisdom. Mana Potion, Rune, and Innervate extends this duration to 120 seconds before the need to downrank to R1 Starfire. Keep in mind the duration will be extended simply by utilizing Mana Spring and/or Blessing of Wisdom.  
---
I'm not sure what to say about your attempt at playing Balance Druid, but it doesn't seem like you gave it a good indepth try. Sorry.
---
 I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
---
I remembered something like that too, but it's not listed on Wowpedia. If it exists, it's probably exactly that.
---
Right, of course. I mean, it seemed to be the main community maintained hunter bug thread, so I wouldn't say it's the same as a random post, but I hear you. However, there's also multiple videos of later vanilla pvp showing they also DRed, so there's that as well.
---
Yup. We ran it a LOT hoping RNG would be kind to us. It was. Just the next run with a rando who won it. I’m still bitter about it.
---
I'm not going to say that there isn't a lot of nuance to it. Another problem people might have with it is that you actually do have to conscientiously place it, you can't just press the buttons and expect it to work. Trap places in front of you, not where you're standing after all. So I could see slowing them not working if you shoot it off to the side to give them less necessary distance to cross before they're safe.
---
&gt;But if you're just going to "HURR DID YOU EVEN PLAY LOL XDD UR MOTOR SKILLS BAD" I'll go ahead and block you now.
---
Don't be a little bitch, you basically implied that my experience was bad too by saying "If you actually played hunter". Like god damn some self awareness goes a long way.
---
Was it a streamer? Because there are reports that Blizzard plans to make big streamers immune to auto-squelch when Classic goes live.
---
He can't even bro. Let him have his space.
---
You just gave me a great idea for my next 30 minute YouTube rant on the differences between classic and retail!
---
The difference is that the higher ilvl items help and make you better everywhere. These people are arguing about raids not giving better items but instead dropping gimmick items that are needed in that raid so you can't just stomp it through with your existing gear. If you are only rewarded with a gimmick gear that isn't useful anywhere else people won't do it. Or do you really think people would be so much into raiding if they didn't drop any gear? People have said even here that they feel entitled on getting best pvp gear from raids instead of from pvp.

Yay let’s get our whole guild to auto report our rival guilds main tank during their progression night. 
---
What could go wrong? 🙃
---
&gt; Uh, ya us Alliance folk are more accepting of others..
---
Tell that to the Blood Elves. The treatment they received as part of The Alliance forced them to switch sides. We could have had Goblins four years early, but noooo, you guys are too racist.
---
Damn, that's really insane to go for. Really too bad you guys didn't get it, but well that's RNG for you :/
---
I bet there were people that already got it on their first ever run :D
---
If I'm an enchanter and I see another enchanter advertising their services in trade, there's nothing stopping me and four friends from reporting and silencing them to cut down the competition.
---
No, it was not a streamer.
---
I wouldn’t say a few but yeah, the vast majority of people who play any game don’t watch a stream or visit a forum about the game.
---
I contemplated to roll a Tauran Shaman... but then because of exactly that hype and huge numbers in any surveys etc I decided not to roll one.
---
Only helps with making the new op gear mandatory. Not with making everything else before it obsolete or the new gear being super op in pvp against everyone not fully kitted in it.
---
I’d love to play a couple months of TBC, but not the whole thing I don’t think.
---
I bought my first house (tiniest cheapest one I could find that wasn't a dump) when I was around your age. Cost me 200+k which was a huge amount back then. Very glad I did it though because houses now cost like 800k here. If I'd waited, I'd never be able to afford anything. It was tough in the beginning but all these years of living rent free made up for it.
---
Well then we simply don't know, but chances are it was inadvertently disabled and not working as Blizzard said. Since Blizzard hasn't indicated otherwise and it's clear they want a skeleton crew running Classic, we can assume auto-squelch will be in Classic.

The beauty of opinions is that im not obligated to.

They probably would have said it wasn't working when they confirmed it was accidentally removed. It's just as likely that enough right-click reports just flags the account for investigation. The threshold is probably pretty high.

I dropped out during BC (because all I wanted to do at 17 was play fucking WoW), but I also had a plan for what I was going to do rather than finish school.  Got my GED and now I'm an electrician and not hurting financially from my decision.

Same issue if the corpse is not in res range: "You do not have a pet"
---
I'm assuming you're referring to DR? Otherwise I have no idea what you mean. If that is what you're referring to, I'm only mentioning it as an issue, not that it wasn't in vanilla. I've already marked it as not a bug on my sheet, even though it was a bug from vanilla. I say that it was a bug as it's been proven that in 2.0.1 it was fixed but never mentioned in any patch notes, and we know that it DR'd in 1.12.
---
Lemme ask you this: If your favorite class was broken in vanilla, would you want it to be also broken in classic? Say priest in 1.12 couldn't heal like it was just fundamentally broken. Extreme example, but it sets a precedent. Do you fix that to where priest can heal properly? Or do you do #nochanges and leave it broken? If polymorph for some reason could only be used on critters in 1.12 and blizz never fixed it, do you leave it as only working on critters in classic? There has to be a precedent for what is fixed and what is left alone, even if its an obvious bug.  
---
I know it's gonna be left in, end of story. It's still game changing though and to pretend it isn't is being naive.
---
Hunter is a bit more fun IMO since you have the whole pet management and training. I would definitely advise AGAINST an Alliance warlock on a PVP server. Biggest pain in the ass to level.
---
playing alli this time around and I lol'd hard at that one lol
---
I’ve had this thought for a while now. I went mage back in Og vanilla and felt pretty masterful with the class. I was set on picking one again until I thought, why not give something else a go? I already DID the mage! Warlock, priest.. hunter... Druid...
---
Thoughts ?
---
I’ll be streaming, but more or less to capture the fun times we (friends/guildies and I) will be having.
---
Name a class that can farm gold faster than hunter solo trib runs.
---
I meant [her spirit](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/2/24/DadangaG.jpg) but forgot the event only lasted 3 days.
---
Yeah, I have one of those guilds too. Lots of guildies coming back and playing, as well as players from our server.
---
I wasn't arguing against a toggle to turn on modern graphics, I was arguing against your belief that "WoW Classic with a fresh coat of paint would still be WoW Classic".
---
That is your opinion and to suggest otherwise is wrong.
---
Feral druids have fairie fire so you won't be able to vanish at all.
---
Again, you don't represent a majority.
---
You're the same type of person to say facebook and google are "private companies" who get to decide what shows up on their platforms. Fuck that. Give the people the power to curate their experience, and leave the rest up to the cesspool that is humanity.
---
Are you.... what?
---
Unsubscribed
---
I personally don't care if a bunch of poopsockers want to kill rag in a week, I'm not going to be one of them because rushing everything is kinda boring.
---
I was under the impression you can weave melle hits between wand hits as they are on a different internal cool down and of GCD.
---
Who are these mysterious "people"?  
---
Is this a question you can answer?
---
Doesn't matter how good a hunter is, they'll always be bottom tier in PVE and mid-tier PVP.
---
A lot of us got sick of the retards asmon attracts and left to join other guilds.
---
I will be a bit harsh here. First time player going mage ...... she might not have much fun since it is one of the harder classes to play especially if you do decide to roll on PVP server. 
---
Warrior is very gear dependent. Any decent guild would want a couple of MTs and OTs for just in case so they will expect a higher level of commitment from their warriors.
---
Getting into a 5 man dungeon as a tank is easy and does not require the spec as long as you have Tanking gear. 
---
Rogue is definitely less commitment as a DPS,  show up, do your thing, have fun. 
---
Don't take it the wrong way but from my experience new female players end up playing either Priest or a Resto druid, pretty models and easier task. 
---
I would go Warrior + Priest or Rogue + Druid.
---
You still can't tank though
---
People play warrior because they want to grind endlessly. They want to always have a next thing to push to. While also seeing the strong impact the earned items reward them.
---
It's the most neck beard class and I am jealous. I want to be the biggest dick on my server.
---
Feign into trap was not inconsistent in vanilla
---
Feign immediately removed you from combat and it was reliable to place a trap after
---
Why not tank as a holy Pally?
---
That's a lie. You don't know how many people it requires. This system is fine as is and you'll have to go out of your own way to abuse it.
---
Also if you are afraid of being silenced - don't be a dick. Or be a dick and take punishment like an adult.
---
Ah my bad I didnt know about the thorium grenade ban
---
I mean, there is a difference between advocating something and just creating a viable playable guide for something everyone knows is bottom tier. He even prefaced he fact that no matter what you do, Warriors will still do x2 the dps of a Balance. You seem to have took his response as a personal attack and makes you come off as the childish one. I'd also like to point out your passive aggressiveness referring to him as "Mr. Boomkin Main" prior to him giving his explanation, which anyone can see was an indication you didn't really care about anything he said as you were already dismissive of his opinion from the get go.
---
" Pet command is sometimes unresponsive, often delayed "  
---
I freaking knew it !!  
---
I played warlock during the stress tests, and this was driving me crazy ! My imp would not obey me half the time, just chilling while I was fighting mobs, even though I spammed his "attack ennemy" key.  
---
They better fix these before the full release.
---
As opposed to just not being able to get the name in the first place? Or getting stuck on an unplayable realm? Really, it's just a name
---
Damn that's good, I'm proud i was able to figure out it was to summer of '69 by the first line.
---
Bravo.
---
Oh noes, sitting in a queue - the horrors.
---
Lol just because its allowed doesn't make it any less scummy. You honestly dont see anything wrong with me paying ~$75/mo to run around with 5 hunters destroying any solo player that I want *because money*?
---
And $75/mo isnt even a lot of money. For a game I intend to spend a socially unacceptable amount of time in, I can afford $2.50 a day.
---
those addons are for classic, not 1.12
---
Is hunter really a class where a good player is completely replaceable with a bad player? I feel like that could be an argument for pve mages who can mousewheel frostbolt, but I've seen plenty of hunters that, through a combination of traps/pet management/autoattack management are way, way more effective than the average hunter in every situation of the game.
---
The point I'm specifically wondering is whether like the most skilled dps/offtank warrior in a raid / rbg / openworld pvp can really stand out to the degree that a hunter can, and, if so, if it's actually worth it for that warrior when he has to compete with the most populated &amp; dedicated class fanbase, while the hunter enjoys ez farming, ez world pvp, ez duels, etc. It just seems like neckbearding as hunter would be way more productive because there are already enough neckbeard warriors
---
That 53 damage though!
---
Well that's odd...
---
Saving new people time.  Don't expect to play this crap and have a spot.  Most guilds don't want you, most pugs won't want you.
---
Classic PvP. Currently on uldum PvE
---
No. They are the CAUSE of fewer accidents. This is not the same as BEING in fewer accidents. Because regardless of how a self driving car operates, the overall rate of accidents isn't going to drop in a statistically significant way until most cars are self driving, because that's the only scenario where their strengths are of significant effect. Whether or not the self driving car is the cause or not, they are still going to be in accidents. Insurance will be much more expensive however, because it's signficantly more difficult to prove who is at fault.
---
&gt; Is hunter really a class where a good player is completely replaceable with a bad player?
---
Yes. The only reason to ever bring a hunter is for one spell: Tranq Shot
---
The problem is, it's a kind of death spiral. Even a 55-45 imbalance can definitely be felt on a server, and over time the 45% faction starts to get sick of being ganked every time they go to farm, so they reroll or transfer off. 45% becomes 40%, 40% becomes 30%, etc.
---
This will be particularly exacerbated in classic which is going to be persistent for at least the next couple of years.
---
Level 60 in Redridge running around camping you and your groups for the tenth time while trying to do a quest in the keep. And you won't feel angry enough to click twice and hit that report button to get some payback? You can take your sanctimonious my-shit-don't-stink attitude somewhere else.
---
If interest (not principal) payable exceeds rent payable of comparable dwelling it is likely not vastly superior (Yes, it has happened).
---
In combat.
---
If that wasn't already obvious.
---
It felt really trolly tbqh
---
that’s the one. they took it out of the game very early on, but if you bought one early, you could keep it
---
Nice alt account.
---
How many new players do you think are actively browsing this sub? I’d bet most people on here are familiar with the oomkin meme based on how frequently it’s brought up here.
---
In a 5v5 fight, the multi-boxer loses. So it's fair.
---
And I'll be buying gold, I have no interest in multi-boxing.
---
Yeah, it's one of the unarmored mounts, they're mentioned in the "Unobtainable Mounts" tab
---
If you're in a guild that kills luci in 15 seconds, you're probably not too stressed about a few meme specs.
---
Feign into trap is *always* from in combat. Otherwise you wouldn’t need to feign
---
Hunters in top tier guilds literally just wing clip for nightfall
---
You sound like such a bitch. Why would your first instinct be to report someone for getting ganked on a pvp server? Just play the game and enjoy it. Or just don't play on a pvp server.
---
How is it bugged and is it confirmed by players ? Any reports on this issue ?
---
gotcha. thanks!
---
This is by far the optimal solution.
---
They can have linked auction houses between the 3 versions so the economy wouldn't be impacted as much when the merge happens.
---
I mean there are pretty much two months left before launch. 
---
Just gotta have faith boys 🤞🏻
---
Then why are retarded guides like this being posted and upvoted?  Literally the worst spec in vanilla WOW.
---
I truly hope they get these fixes together in time.
---
Per responsiveness is just too core to the class, among other issues
---
New AV is better than the afk 2 day queue fest. If you think r14 is a solo job lmao. It takes tons of effort from a guild to get one person to R14. It takes coordinated effort, dodging bad matchups and planned comps.
---
That's such a weak argument. Of course a coordinated group of 5 will beat a multi boxer. But how often do you travel with 4 other people? 
---
What's more likely is someone will be farming and suddenly 5 pets, and 5 arcane shots come out of no where and they're dead. Theres literally nothing that a solo player can do against 5 hunters. 
---
Or are we supposed to call our guild for "epic wPvp" everytime we see a multiboxer?
---
It takes five reports to immediately disconnect and squelch someone, confirmed by many. Don't call someone a liar when you don't know the facts. To the contrary, there are going to be many dicks abusing others by falsely reporting and squelching them.
---
Mozambique here.
---
Nr 1 is and will always be Ulduar, whereas a close 2nd is Throne of Thunder. That raid was atmospheric as hell, except for the penultimate boss memorable all throughout and had fun as fuck class design during its existance.
---
&gt; No. They are the CAUSE of fewer accidents.
---
&gt; Insurance will be much more expensive however, because it's signficantly more difficult to prove who is at fault.
---
These are contradictory statements. My insurance already went down for having lane assist and auto-braking. And the level 3 Audi or a Tesla would have dropped my insurance even more.
---
I miss nostalrius :(
---
I'm not naive, just not a child. If i'm getting camped, I'll just go level in a different zone, or form a group for a dungeon.
---
Again, why play on a pvp server if that is your mentality. It's fine if you kill someone, but if someone kills you its not cool? Its a video game. Play to have fun. If you "rage" over a video game, maybe you should take up another hobby or some therapy.
---
Also, level 60 camping lower levels isn't far too common, considering they have a dishonorable kill system.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dishonorable_Kill
---
Actually pretty good tbh
---
I logged into BFA out of boredom a few weeks ago and there were 2 in the Human starting area alone. Personal anecdotes dont detract from the situation.
---
For one, that depends on if they caused the accident. Autonomous driving doesn't mean ZERO accidents. It means less. It's like saying you have a computer that can never malfunction. Doesn't happen. And the cost of assessing that is going to be much higher, because we can't hold a computer responsible the way we hold a person. 
---
The law applies to people. As a person you're expected to know the rules of the road, and are responsible for observing them. "I forgot" isn't an excuse. But it is for a computer. "The system maulfunctioned" is a real defense that will happen the moment these become commonplace. Who is at fault then? There is no easy answer to that. 
---
Furthermore, insurance companies will want heavy investigations into accidents between people and self driving cars because, as insurance companies do, they don't want to pay out. They'll want records from the car, proof that it was or was not operating within spec, so on and so forth. That will take time, and money. So it becomes several orders of magnitude more difficult to insure a self driving car, and will for a long time.
---
Not only was it like that in vanilla, there's no reason to believe that wasn't intentional. I can easily see it being an attempt at a pseudo-3-dimensional take on a speech bubble.
---
If you look closely you can even see shadows on the borders of the main bubble where the tail is.
---
I would imagine if they ever got rid of the sub, they would have to ban it.
---
Again, there are places that exist outside of Europe. In Vanilla the "Oceanic" servers were still located in America, anyone from Asia/Australia would not have gotten less than 200ms. Also there were much shittier internet connections back then. I levelled to 60 on dial-up, 800 - 1200ms, 0/10 would not recommend
---
tl:dr,
---
you don't have the merit to prove you're a skilled player (top 0.01%), yet in your mind you are one. 
---
luls.
---
Against melee, you don't need to scatter to trap unless you suck. I would regularly trap people all the time without having to use scatter. It just makes it easier.
---
Against casters and hunters is where it is more useful and needed. Prevents you from eating damage on the way too them, and they can't just avoid it. Especially in group pvp, if some hunter runs his ass up to me I assume he is going to trap me, so I'll actively avoid it. Can't do that while scattershot
---
&gt; I logged into BFA out of boredom a few weeks ago and there were 2 in the Human starting area alone.
---
&gt; Personal anecdotes dont detract from the situation.

You only get to pick one.
---
That should not be in 1.12. Blizzard fixed those items at some point.
---
Absolutely, stuns are a Rogue's biggest weakness. Fears can be trinketed if they matter.
---
actually I want to raid with the vegana
---
I think you're misunderstanding, I don't think it should be removed. I think it should be adjusted to suit modern internet connections so that the end result is in line with what it was back then
---
Give up lad.  There's no coming back.  That last post sunk you like a ton of bricks.  All the whataboutery in the world isn't going to change that.
---
Just looking at activision’s track record with other games that have “no micro transactions”
---
It also seemed like you wanted opinions on the matter.  If you didn’t, then ignore my comment, it is mostly subjective
---
Like you ever played vanilla, you dipshit.
---
use the exploration strat. 
---
skip the initial starting zone and run and explore til lvl 3~5.
---

To be fair, Paladins don't have magic cleanse at 40 which is huge

Why would somebody else's willingness to pay money make it so another guy deserves to die... You gotta come up with something better than that

Are the unobtainable mounts unobtainable just because blizzard doesn’t want people rushing to 60 / grinding for them?
---
I was showing you how pointless your personal story was by giving you my own pointless personal story...

The fact is that it exists and can be used in a manner that is unfair to a person who is not doing it. It's p2w and its scummy. That's all I'm saying.
---
@pet references your pet (or pet's corpse) but if you're out of range, the pet is dismissed, or the corpse has despawned, there will be no pet to target, therefor: "You do not have a pet"
---
Traps don't have an arming time in vanilla
---
Honestly, I don't the total amount of time they spent talking was bad, but they should do it after a matchup, not after each duel. Esfand was trying to do that with his interviews but he said his headset kept dying. The in-between duel talk should be short and sweet and quickly hype up the next duel. After the matchup they can take 5/10 minutes to do an interview, talk, and even pull highlight clips from chat. Maybe don't hard on that until the later rounds, but either way it would help the flow of the tournament overall. Both Rich and Asmon were at their best in the middle of the duels, not during their post-game analysis. It's not like the very start of duels is super hype or anything, but they missed the first 30 seconds or so of a number of duels yesterday because they weren't really paying attention lol.
---
It's not my mentality, it's called giving an example. I'm showing one of the many possible ways this system will be abused because it's giving GM powers to players.
---
#NoChanges
---
Spells redirected to it deal 1 damage.  Attacks only do full damage to it if you’re specifically targeting it.
---
respawn rates are different versus classic.

i've done pservers and beta.

also, my speed times were always faster on beta (when empty).

---
&gt; Autonomous driving doesn't mean ZERO accidents. It means less.
---
Which is enough to always lower the cost of insurance.
---
You really haven't done much research on this and you definitely don't know the industry.
---
All these people saying it moved due to the Cataclysm, I'm pretty sure that is not stated anywhere. They likely moved it purely due to gameplay reasons, Kul Tiras would never fit in Baradin Bay and be half of the expansions new land. It's sad they went with the retcon route, but at least Boralus is epic
---
Yes it should be allowed.  Its fun as hell!  
---
I five boxed Vanilla starting about a year after launch and did it for around four years on Magtheridon.  
---
I got bored of WOW and started five boxing in Eve.    
---
In WOW I did it mostly as a challenge to see if I could do it with hardware only and I managed to make it work.  I don't think I ever had a negative effect on other players.  In Eve, it was a whole different story.  The mechanics in Eve were such that my main followed by 4 suicide bombers could wreak havoc.  
---
I think people are going to be very surprised by the number of people that will dual box in WOW as it is so much easier to set up and do now.
---
    /cast Freezing Trap
---
    /script PetPassiveMode();
---
    /script if UnitAffectingCombat("player") then CastSpellByName("Feign Death") end
---
What's so shitty about that?
---
&gt; unfair 
---
&gt; scummy
---
Opinions is all you're saying.
---
60 shaman is essentially the exact same as what you saw.
---
welcome to gank city.
---
So if there is a problem with a particular part of RCR it should be addressed. For example the minimum level requirement, address false reporting, faster appeal process by accounts with higher level characters.
---
Agreed

---
gnome rogue, orb of deception -&gt; turn into a tauren, now enjoy the extra melee range as a Tauren rogue. OP as fkkkkk
---
It was like that. It is now going to be who can sit in AV the longest, doesn't really matter how well you perform individually at all.
---
I have, it's a great stream.
---
They knew some things but were missing many implications of their design decisions.  That's part of why Vanilla has so much lasting power.  It has been up to the players to discover much of the game.  
---
For an extreme example, look at early caster class gear with agility on it.  There is no way devs at Blizzard now or then would intentionally put a stat on items that is useless for the intended class.
---
They should treat each expansion as a separate game. Later developments shouldn't replace Classic.
---
Are you going to try and tell me how I'm wrong about anything I've said so far? Shouldn't be that hard if I'm just some unskilled shitter, right?
---
The only thing more bandwidth ( that 1.5 vs 450 ) does is let you send more data it makes the tube wider if you will. It doesn't make the data travel to the server faster (ping). Now infrastructure has gotten better and depending on how bad your route (highway of computers your data went through to reach the game server) to the server before you may in some cases have lower latency ( I have 10 less than I did on vanilla to the same server).  
---
It won't be too drastically different even with an increase to bandwidth. For example I recently went from a 50 mb/s down 5 mb/s up package. It's now 500 mb/s down and 50 mb/s up. My ping to games however hasn't changed at all.
---
Dude he’s a rogue
---
&gt; yep its the race ! a gnome is the ~~biggest~~shortest mistake XDD
---
As of 2015, all but 3 European countries had the majority of their population in urban areas.
---
To give people want to enjoy the game and give others the opportunity to maximize their output, even if being a top tier boomkin makes you a middle of the pack caster.
---
I'll play it all, every time I stopped playing there was something I wasn't happy I missed. I quit during the first patch of cata and came back end of mop, I missed what a lot of people consider the best patch of wow with Isle of thunder. And just mop in general, i was one of those pandas? Now you've lost me.
---
I prefer classic wow in many ways but I still enjoy what the game has become. Very different games imo
---
&gt; the fact that you cant muster even a weak defense in favor of multiboxing shows that you know its scummy and unfair.
---
No it doesn't.
---
You're such a faux intellectual dude. You know exactly what the fuck i'm talking about without all your fancy word salad. You've yet to give an argument on why blizzard should censor their platform based on whatever moral outline they like. Pitiful attempt at being condescending when it just looks like you got the thesaurus bot to translate all your shit.
---
Yeah. Sorry kiddo. You've not a clue what you're talking about ;)
---
But hey. If I'm wrong, then feel free to come back and show me in ten years. Until then, doesn't look so good for this weird thing you decided to make a point out of without actually knowing the first thing about.
---
The problem with hunters currently is that their attack range is being calculated as if it were a melee attack, as a post 2.3 system.  
---
Some of the consequences of this is that a Tauren vs Caster (any, even tauren) is a gongshow advantage in the tauren favor.
---
A Tauren Hunter attacking a Human Mage, has a 40.5 yard max range, center to center, before talents!.  The mage can only get 41 yard range with talented fire spells.  If the hunter takes some range talents, they can attack the make from 46.5 yards away, 1/4 a full distance blink.
---
Damn dood. Regardless of if you are right or wrong. You are the most toxic person I've seen in a while. Like you are on cocaine and wont shut the fuck up.
---
"top tier boomkin" the memes are growing stronger...
---
Windfury is just fine for leveling, you'll just want a weapon around 3.0 speed. It synergizes super well with Flurry.
---
Everything will be so nothing will be.
---
&gt; Against melee, you don't need to scatter to trap unless you suck.
---
Holy shit my man tell that to these other people I've been getting into arguments with in this thread. I need some god damn backup, we're outnumbered.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the problem they have with it is that they don't know how to actually aim it because it places some distance in front of you. I pointed that out somewhere along the line, but it didn't seem to get through to anyone.
---
&gt;Especially in group pvp, if some hunter runs his ass up to me I assume he is going to trap me, so I'll actively avoid it. Can't do that while scattershot
---
That makes more sense but I'm of the opinion that it's a better defensive tool, at least in a BG. Like you should be enough of a damage threat to pull aggro from people and have them approach you instead of, as a ranged class, walking over to others in order to CC them. Especially because if you maintain range you can just walk away from them to exit their range as well, if needed. Idk, it's a good tactic for helping others though, I guess.
---
No Pandas as far as the eye can see.
---
is this beta or a private server?
---
40 dps VS bring an actual non-shit DPS that can do way more than +40 dps
---
I'm a lobbyist for the industry, a part owner and founder in an automated technology insurance company, and spend 90% of my working time listening to industry experts.
---
It's you that has no clue. But thankfully, I won't be seeing any more of your messages.
---
They will have to start selling in game pets, mounts and transmogs to pay for all the extra staff they are hiring.... /s
---
&gt;"everyone who disagrees with me is ELITIST!"
---
but when classic is released, won't classic also be retail?
---
Still nothing? I was genuinely expecting you to peice together some kind of actual argument. Too bad.
---
Majority doesn't mean everyone. Just more than 50%
---
That is some weird ass logic.
---
I want to be axe man though
---
I believe you’d get your ass kicked saying something like that.
---
I would guess start of WoD. I started in mid cata and enjoyed that and early mop, so those two are in, and I've heard good things about bc. Wrath and vanilla are expansions I'd always wished I had played because of how amazing the zones and story were when I levelled through them, plus in the case of vanilla all the class quest stuff that I missed out on. WoD however I've only heard bad things about, other than the start of the expansion.
---
But... But that would be mean! Nobody would do that!
---
&gt; I'm a lobbyist for the industry, a part owner and founder in an automated technology insurance company, and spend 90% of my working time listening to industry experts.

&gt; It's you that has no clue. But thankfully, I won't be seeing any more of your messages.
---
Uh huh. 
---
"I just made up a fake story about what I do and am going to block your messages so I can tell myself I was right even though I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about"
---
Well, who am I to keep you from getting your feelings hurt ;)
---
I don't need an argument to change your personal opinion about multiboxers. Most people don't care and don't notice. Get over it. I won't be seeing any more of your messages.
---
Haha. Had to block me? Nice.
---
Seems like they’re removing people’s choices. If I wanna rush then I’ll rush. If I wanna grind then I’m gonna grind. Maybe I’m wrong
---
the argument is whether it SHOULD be allowed not whether it is or isnt. something being allowed/disallowed doesn't determine whether it's right or wrong. your descriptive  "that's just the way it is" doesn't add anything of value to a normative discussion
---
I actually enjoyed the spergs taking screentime. Having that mage with the blue cap taking up all the screen was hilarious.
---
You should be using a range of 4s, not  +-4 making a range of 8. You’re well over 99.99999% of the population.
---
&gt; I also hated that horde and alliance players saw each other much more because of the city, so it destroyed the mistery of even seeing the enemy.
---
...neutral towns were everywhere in vanilla, m8
---
Fuckin A
---
Unfortunately if something can be abused, it usually is...
---
It's not pay to win, ganking doesn't win you anything.
---
That was the eve online mentality
---
Multi boxing perfectly allowed, including use with tools like keyclone and the screen splitter
---
It got to the point people would have 30+ alts all flying in synchronicity and 1shotting shit off the field.  Even more so for people doing it with capital ships.
---
It is literally pay to win, an advantage based off your IRL income 
---
This go out of hand (as it did when multiboxing was free reign in wow)  and CCP then made the good decision of banning the 3rd party key clone software.  Each client must have manual key / mouse input if you wanna multibox.
---
Same should apply to wow.  If they wanna multibox 10 but have to manually controll them all and they have the multitasking skills to do it?  good on them.
---
However multiboxing should not be used as a pay to win system.
---
Wasn't that because some items had random stats...
---
So attacks don't break it from 1st hit, thats nasty.
---
Naturally it should be bannable offense. It is not intended for anyone to wield the power of more than one character at the same time. It also breaks world immersion and it is literally pay to win.
---
&gt;  I forgot to mention I do agree that horde getting paladins and alliance getting shamans I was not a fan of. I liked the exclusivity to it and it made the factions truly seem different.
---
The problem with that is game balance.
---
Blizz kept balancing the two classes to have equal buffs/debuffs and such, and at some point they're just going to be equal, so instead of homogenizing both classes, they just gave both classes to both factions.
---
I'll never understand why people actually got upset over this.
---
I hope so, windfury for every group in raids!
---
Hey, you wanna come over?
---
Nah man, I don’t want you fuckin up my life too...
---
25ish-50ish Shaman is a beast. Really fun class to level with on a PvP server
---
You're never going to convince the people with the authority to make that decision change their minds. Get over it.
---
!/2 way through cata. The first raids were good.
---
&gt; Only complete retard
---
so her target audience then
---
Ouch, you guys get a bit screwed with on low level swords from what I can tell.
---
Orc/trolls have a quest that in North Durotar that gives a sword, I usually do it then go to UC and train swords ASAP
---
you cannot ban 3rd party software since it doesnt latch itself to the game. 
---
  makes no sense
---
and you cannot prove that you're even using it on client side, though I mean it's pretty obvious but no concrete proof since you can technically do all those movements by yourself. Highly unlikely but it proves a point
---
So literally all hunter issues. Why do I feel bad again? Lol please let me get away.
---
A tank ditched my LBRS group once and I 4 man tanked it for a few bosses. Some of my gear was cloth and I doubt I had any stamina so it was more of a healing feat than anything.
---
Our multi glad premade hunter is irreplaceable.
---
&gt;derogatory terms such as "bitch" and making light of a serious medical issue such as AIDS
---
HE'S RIGHT HERE OFFICER THIS IS THE MAN WHO SAID THE UNCIVIL NO NO WORDS OH THE HUMANITY OH MY EARSSSS
---
A toaster
---
honestly that's the funnest shit ever to see such a sight. I'd be thankful for the opportunity to try and derail a multiboxer because it hurts to fear one or sap one
---
I think you’re looking at that backwards tbh, the guilds that are doing 15 second Lucifron kills are the ones min-maxing and barring meme specs from entry. Sure they could totally afford to slot some in, but I’d assume they’re already going pretty hard and want farm content down as fast as possible.
---
This is also assuming the hunter even wants to pvp. Leeway doesn't matter with mobs.
---
No, I'm talking about pre-1.5 tier sets:
---
"The following item sets have had their statistics, effects, and set bonuses updated:
---
Arcanist, Netherwind, Prophecy, Transcendence, Felheart, Nemesis, Cenarion, Stormrage Raiment, Nightslayer, Bloodfang, Giantstalker, Dragonstalker, Earthfury, Ten Storms, Might, Wrath, Lawbringer, and Judgement."
---
I can't find a snapshot of the gear before this patch but I'm pretty sure agility was on some of the Arcanist Ragalia.
---
Learning the basics for cooking then I think mastering your favorite meals
---
Lok’Tar Ogar Brother!!
---
Is there anywhere we can see the final brackets and how it turned out?
---
As undead: is the wolf riding only needed for purchasing the wolf or also for using/binding it?
---
At the sunwell patch in TBC, that isle of quel’whatever was the earliest “gear catch up” patch I can remember. 
---
Before that up until black temple you actually needed to do previous raid content, so you would need to “play the game” not “play the patch” like it is today.
---
its allowed what more do you want. 
---
I'm not here to discuss your opinions or feelings, I personally like multiboxing and I'm glad its allowed. That's all you gotta know
---
I mean, for any MMORPG the answer is immediate and hard NO since multiboxing and even alts in general absolutely destroy any sort of overall economy, socialization and immersion.
---
But WoW is a themepark so it doesn't really have any of these to begin with. So it's like... who cares
---
This is what I get for thinking you can reason with a Tom Brady fan 4Head
---
There is nothing stopping me multiboxing and auto squelching everyone I see. Pretty lame imo.
---
It's still a big dps gain
---
Blood Elves kinda dug their own grave, to be fair. They pretty much left everyone in Lordaeron to die, then went full Pikachu face when Arthas decided to dick them and nobody wanted to help.
---
Snorting magic dust and demon cocaine doesn't help much either.
---
What's stopping people from writing /report in chat as revenge?
---
How is retail still operational if it has the system in place?
---
Would it be worth it to include /cast !autoshot in your timed sequence macro?
---
Ya, I can see your point on that.  It certainly would break immersion for people trying to enjoy themselves in an RP setting.  I would never box on an RP server, its kind of pointless.
---
1660 would be overkill for sure. 1050 might do it, 105ti if you want to be safe, 1660 if you want to jack up the settings a bit and have 120+ fps easy or play other games.
---
I think rogue is more of your type.
---
I miss Bawls
---
37 here, not sure if I qualify as old fart, but I sure as shit won't be raiding 3 nights a week and going through a 4 pack of red bull per night anymore
---
They’re boxes of 12
---
Dont listen to these dweebs. Hunters are great in PvP.
---
I'm thinking i5-8400 or 7500.
---
I could use advice on RAM as well.
---
I will be running WoW on SSD.
---
Here is a classic beta benchmark of several computers.
---
[https://youtu.be/5uA1Hi9AKZo](https://youtu.be/5uA1Hi9AKZo)
---
This was my exact experience too. I loved Firelands but going into Dragon Soul everything just started going to shit. Probably didn't help that my guild started falling apart due to our RL and 2 officers quitting for real life reasons.
---
Ally were pissed because it was supposed to be an ally only tournament that got changed into a streamer only tournament last second and had like 80% horde.
---
I have an original i5 750 with a 1060 and get 100fps + in the beta so yeah, any desktop i5 will be completely fine.
---
Autoshot without toggle? I.e can spam it and autoshot will stay on
---
Daze is there to make you still afraid of the world even when nothing can catch you, as if you ride through that pack, what if they daze you? Well now you have to actually care about how you are getting from a to b instead of brainlessly autorunning because you coukd easily get dazed and killed.
---
Outside of raids: it's always tank. Playing Warrior, Druid or Paladin means you can get your pre-raid dungeon gear on your schedule, whenever you want.
---
In raids: it's generally geared DPS Warriors and Mages. These are competitive slots though and you will need to farm a lot of shit before anyone wants you at all. If you want to get into raids without breaking your neck first, then Shaman (Horde) and Warlocks (Alliance) are always in demand.
---
Note that if you roll a tank for the easy pre-raid gear but you don't want to start your own guild, then you might want to plan on being DPS or a healer when you get into raids. Main tanks are the least-recruited role.

Except op is dead cause he kept missing. In most other cases, the offhand will be more beneficial, but clearly not here, right?
---
Even in 40 man Raids &amp; AV?
---
Might as well try to push for 60
---
I have never seen a hunter do that...  Most guilds wouldn't even ask a hunter to do that.
---
After clearing heroic Firelands in Cataclysm. Ulduar and Firelands are my favorite raids, and I would love to experience Ragnaros on heroic mode. I think the death knell sounded for WoW when DS's quality was sacrificed for LFR.
---
Never did 40 man raids
---
RIP
---
Yes! Please everyone get more hysterical about hunters being broken and switch classes.
---
What are the warlock and druid for?
---
Remember the world buff stacking exploit will be fixed for classic.  Hunter dps falls behind largely because they don't benefit from those buffs anywhere near as much as others.
---

&gt; Remember the world buff stacking exploit will be fixed for classic.

No it won't. Because it's not an exploit.
---
I'm in Asia where I can't buy a lot of the food I used to enjoy back when I was a teenager, so I've literally got imported boxes of Mac and Cheese saved up for the week classic launches for maximum immersion
---
Well well well what do we have here. An ad hominem.
---
That's all client rendering. Has nothing to do with the server.
---
Activision should have updated the old client instead of trying to shoe horn old data into the new one.
---
To me, my name is incredibly important. I would lose the will to continue playing if I suddenly lose my name. I know that sounds overdramatic, but you seem to underestimate how much some of us love our characters.
---
The pirated realm shitters are in for a rude awakening.
---
Ogar!
---
You're talking about the ones with cooldowns, that doesn't prevent them from being stacked, it just needs more planning and patient.
---
Go with Honor!
---
Well if ganking doesn't win you anything what does then? The purpose of pay to win is to be stronger than others using real world currency. That's literally pay to win.
---
I like how /r/classicwow complained leeway wasn’t a thing and now they complain it is.
---
They're going to make it so they don't stack.
---
If WOTLK just hadn't bitched out and created a NEW entry level raid instead of reusing Naxx and the original Naxx had been left alone, it would have been fine.
---
WOTLK was the end because it's when they started removing shit.
---
No, pay to win means substituting real money for effort in-game. WoW is still pay-to-win because you can buy gold, but multi-boxing isn't really pay-to-win.
---
Yeah I was thinking of some over specific circumstances when I said that. So yeah I'll just agree it depends.
---
No they aren't. Otherwise you'd have a source.
---
Nice 👍🏾 guide. Tbh if I get that Swift Zul’ian Tiger all of Azeroth will know because I’ll personally wake everyone up.
---
46 or 47?
---
I don't think that players who got in were bad but in the end, rather than skill, it came down to either their popularity and how good they looked in eyes of Esfand and Asmon.
---
If this was supposed to be the great duel tournament that ends the beta then I would like to see those 16 players make into those spot by winning qualifiers that would be happening for a few days period to the main event.
---
"Getting 50% raid dps and 30% raid health is obviously not meant to happen either. "
---
What do you mean "meant to happen"? The buffs exist in Vanilla. We wanted Vanilla. The devs put those buffs in. It isn't going to be as easy to stack all of these buffs in Classic at least. What do you expect to happen when people release a 15 year old game that people have figured out already? Also, those are like hardcore speedruns you are talking about and AQ gear is fcking amazing. Killing Skeram super fast when you have Cthun gear isn't even dependent on world buffs. You can still easily fuck up and die and lose the buffs if your raid is not competent. The average guild isn't just going to faceroll cause they have buffs.
---
Is this Tanner from high school again?
---
I'm in the same boat, though I know it's probably a minority opinion.  My name is my character's identity; to have that stripped from them feels like a murder of sorts.
---
who fucking cares? it is literal hundreds of thousands to millions of people that will be paying a sub to blizz.
---
yeah, and then when you throw in "blizzard" it really becomes dubious lol
---
You think this is a joke but people legit do this in RBGs.
---
This is less about weapon choice and more about risk management, as with pretty much all solo pve deaths.
---
this guy downvotes
---
&gt;What's the incentive for a Rogue to go run this tier? What sort of gear would you need to put into the raid to make it worth running for them?
---
The same incentive as everyone else.  Gear that buffs skills and abilities that are underpowered and not viable.
---
Rogues also have the daggers vs swords debate which gear can affect.
---
But you can't form a group in classic if you are muted, you can in retail.
---
Great video, all you need now is the deep voice movie guy at the end saying “This film is not yet rated”.
---
Um, you do realize there is a lot of people who don't care about streamers at all? Streamers don't matter at all, they are small time twitch streamers and that's it, they don't matter at all in the grand scheme. You people and your streamers, I swear to god, I'm getting tired of hearing about them.........

This is what i am worried about, and it seems the answer is yes.
---
It could be easily corrected by a professional. Give it some new life man
---
it's not like streamers have their own private invite only servers, find out what server they are on and make a character.
---
I’d like to see you come to countries like Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and so on. The population is majority rural (like 45/55, but still)

---
if you are comparing anything to a private server then you invalidate the point.
---
I did, seems like you didnt based on how triggered you get hearing how vanilla actually worked ;)
---
No, because all range attacks activate it anyway
---
    #showtooltip  
---
    /use [mod:shift] Multi-Shot;Arcane Shot
---
Correct. While some of the code may be the same, it's clearly interacting differently with the client or w/e somehow.
---
I don't see how people can dispute that it's different, when there's literal empirical proof in video form of it not working that way in vanilla lol
---
There's nothing wrong with it. People are passionate about the game and its community, and Horde has a very distinct culture. If this guy comes across another Hordie, you bet your ass they'll shake hands. That's pretty cool. At least the tattoo looks nice even without context.
---
All that said, Alliance for life.
---
A more optimized engine. There are are less flashy animations and effects in Classic than legion
---
Yeah. Alliance tends to have a solid market for the BOE greens you get in redridge (redridge machete) and the deadmines (defias rapier), simply because it's not really practical to get a pair of swords from quests: if you go to darkshore at level 12 for briarsteel shortsword, you are too low level to pick up daryl's shortsword on loch modan on the way. And to come back the other way makes no sense, as if you are level 14 in darkshore, the best thing to do is stay in darkshore. 
---
On the bright side, Alliance has way better access to BOE swords at low levels, because of course, ragefire chasm doesn't really have 1+% drop chance green swords, nor does wailing caverns. Whereas, the mobs that drop goblin screwdriver, redridge machete, and defias rapier are all 1%+ drop chance non unique mobs, and one of them isn't even an elite or in an instance.
---
I was expecting more horde attention andys but I guess not many soda subs got beta access. Asmonds community was sure to supply plenty.
---
Honestly the shit pvp balance and lack of arenas is why i can never enjoy vanilla over TBC. I'm still gonna enjoy it for what it is, and have fun doing raids and some wpvp, but I'm gonna enjoy TBC more when it comes.
---
They removed the concept of downranking in wotlk. This was one of coolest tool for healers imo.
---
This is one of the least cringey warcraft tattoos I've seen. It looks good even without knowing what it means.
---
A grave oversight.
---
There is a website listing streamer servers just so people can avoid them a huge number want to stay the hell away from streamers.
---
They could simply not have it in the game. We don't need policing and censorship in Classic. It wasn't in Vanilla, idiot snowflakes who are weak and cry when someone says a bad word in chat, are too lazy to use language filter or ignore and are selfish and want to ruin the game for everyone are not welcome anyway. They ruined retail already and will probably be hated in classic by the vast majority of players.
---
True, but at this point with a 1660 for a game like vanilla, even in the new engine, the game doesnt have the modern spell effects etc, so even a card Will help plow through the data. 
---
Unless OP hasnt changed processor the past 15 years, OP Will be fine. 
---
Id worrry about changing that 60hz monitor.

can't unsee

100% agree with you. Patch 4.1 is when it all went to shit !
---
Michael Bolton?

This legitimately happened to me while testing warrior leveling on a private server.

And then i see a hunter 5 levels below me right next to me, killing monsters left and right with zero downtimes.

for sure!

“Most people don’t live in big cities” I have faith you can see the flaw in this.
---
If youre going for peak optimization, hunters have the best nightfall uptime in the game, if they just spam wingclip. Hunters fall off hard at the end of AQ and into naxx, if you want to keep playing hunter and not be forced to reroll for naxx farm in a hardcore guild better get your wingclip button ready
---
It would probably be a while before I jump ship, but I would become much more casual in cata and onwards, maybe a bit more casual even in wrath. TBC is my shit though, gonna live that.
---
(although I'll say, I doubt they will go beyond Wrath)
---
Okay, I put my discs in. All four I assume at the same time is fine. Also put in the game manual, to kind of jog the toaster's memory. Idk - not a tech whiz.  I pulled the thingamajig down and it seems like it's working. Can't find the mouse plug in. When does the smoke stop and how do I get it to project the game on to a wall or device or whatever. Thanks.
---
I guess if you are only eating hot pockets and monster your gonna need 26 nappies a day.
---
I'm going warrior and leveling with a friend who will also be my pocket healer, going to be awesome.
---
Romania has insanely good 4g coverage at least, from personal experience. Better than any other country I’ve ever visited.
---
This is good advice if you need to pickup a cpu.
---
Well, the players won't be able to, but the host of servers is able to see who comes in under which IP address. Of course people could even overcome that by firing up a VPN before logging onto the secondary accounts, leaving Blizzard biting the dust. 
---
A second angle would be matching on billing details.
---
While this is all hypothetical, I believe there will always be way to cheat the system. In the end rightclick-to-report is a function that enables us to regulate cheaters in more cases than that it enables cheaters to beat the system, especially with employee from Blizzard on a budget, don't you agree?
---
In its prime  :)
---
Patch 4.1 is my "Fly, you fools" signal. It nerfed everything and is the turning point that actually ruined the game imo (even though there were signs of the decline before, and some patches were cool later).
---
&gt; The state of classic WoW will go stale after 3 months and people will become so highly geared in t2, t3, 
---
Not even available in 3 months.
---
MMOs have a near 100% disappointment rate, if you're counting on one to be good you're in for a bad time
---
he kicked at them at one point, it was so funny.
---
It take it you want nerfs on warrior or buffs to other specs?
---
It really does though. You think you do but you don't
---
 Something in between could be nice but #nochanges
---
Could have an IV so you don't have to drink as well. Then get ultimate efficiency by connecting the two.
---
Faire Fire is about an additional 100 dps per melee.
---
Sigh \*unzips\*
---
You’re not wrong at all!
---
I think telling a rogue to not dual wield is silly advice, but op is also presenting a pretty silly situation in their snapshot of the combat log. It’s silliness all around! :)
---
Not in single core single thread performance, which is all that matters for Classic WoW.
---
My thoughts??...mmm see you on August 27th
---
Welcome to the brotherhood but of course there a good and bad people drawn to both factions so it's really silly to stereotype factions. Regardless, being a Horde during the classic timeframe is basically the best time to be a Hotde. So what  class are you thinking?
---
If you abandon the alliance you abandon all of humanity. You will do nothing but forsake yourself by joining those heathen.

May you live forever Chinesefireball

Yet again, obvious troll is obvious.
---
There are already writing automation programs. They're not great, but they'll get better. Fiction writers may be safe forever unless we get true AI (which I doubt). Artists also are safer, probably just because a lot of people will disagree with art made by machines (defeats the point of art). Illustrators though, are in trouble.
---
Therapists, nurses, etc. could lose all the physical parts of their job to automation, which will be nice for them as individuals, but certainly lead to fewer jobs available. (Better service instead? Hah!)
---
The only reason human monitors are superior to machine ones for some tasks is because the patient's experience is subjective, and many patients don't know how to communicate it properly. So that also would require true AI.
---
I've heard late-stage capitalism in so many places lol

I sent a mod mail with the following:
---
&gt;Its insane that one of your new mods felt the need to censor a user over this. Read the censored comment in this chain. It was directed at no one; it was describing a hypothetical UI/Server issue. He wasnt attacking anyone in the remotest sense. Yes, he used the word bitch. Yes he described that frustrating hypothetical scenario as "aids" which is an incredibly common figure of speech. We call things in video game culutre "cancer" ALL THE TIME. Its the same concept. Please explain to that mod that mod powers arent for power tripping. Thanks
---
Theres already a solution; its called TBC.
---
The 3600 is beating the 9900k in single thread on passmark right now. Not to mention ingles i5s aren't threaded anyway and the 3600 is.
---
How does Boomkin compare for damage-per-threat? Early in raiding, at least, it seems many dps classes are threat capped. My running theory is that damage-per-threat may be more relevant to early/undergeared raid groups versus the pserver speedrunning meta.
---
You should be good to go really, the only time it really shits out is when like a bunch of stuff suddenly appears.  Like if you roll up on 20 mages spamming blizzard at a choke point, it'll be like what the fuck do I do, for a second or two.
---
A lot of the bullshit is on Blizzards end, but that's on retail, classic should be smoother because everything is simpler.
---
Hahahahaha!!! This is pure gold right here
---
Not trolling mate. They should have announced it last year let’s be real.
---
The hype train only chugs forth for so long until it completely runs out of steam.
---
I’ve moved onto bigger and better things
---
T3 Helmet is terrible thank god hide helmet is a option
---
The changes are happening much faster now than ever before. Even the industrial revolution didn't happen overnight, and that caused massive social problems which took generations to iron out. (Not to mention widescale social movements like unionism)
---
You're probably on the wrong sub if you're looking for 1.12 addons. This sub is for Classic WoW.
---
Yet here you are, complaining on the subreddit for Classic.
---
Big true.
---
what
---
We would like to play to have fun, but when you'll have to write appeals every second day because some troll decided to mute you for no reason, or your MT got banned because a rival guild thought it's funny to waste 40 peoples time by banning your MT or even all tanks or raid night.
---
Trying to have fun in a BG and you take the flag? Whoops the opponent team is 10 people so they can get you disconnected by mass reporting you.
---
People thought you can't easily exploit layering...surprise, it's trivially easy to exploit it. Now some people say right click report and auto-banning is fine, people won't exploit it. They will. 
---
So exited for the report war and layer jumping meta, OG vanilla experience.
---
Thanks I appreciate the support, I hope that they understand.
---
Yeah, and a lot of experts think those benchmarks are fake. We won't know until the 7th,
---
Yeah.  Any gear past Naxx would have to be like 1ilvl higher at most per tier.
---
No, most people's reactions aren't to lash out impotently like you. Most people would probably just hearth and quest somewhere else, or call in their guild friends, or log onto an alt and game  the AH for 20 minutes while waiting for the aggressors to lose interest, or log out and walk their dog, or any number of other diversions in a massive game like WoW. Most players over age 12, especially ones who are used to PVP servers, would not knowingly abuse a system.
---
Then why do you disagree with these points? Wouldn't this be a closer experience to the original? It wouldn't require much work either.
---
More important than the RP-PvP issue KeK
---
There is nothing silly in unequipping your offhand to get better hit chance, especially in case of leveling, when you may have a good level 40 slow sword in MH and crappy level 20 dagger in OH. Getting a miss on that heavy hitting sword would be crucial if you are about to die in 3 hits but still stick in the fight for some reason.
---
Holy shit reading comprehension. The point is that it CAN be abused and therefore it WILL be, even if the majority don't.
---
Or they could start selling stuff AND kick support staff to make more money...oh wait that happened already.
---
Gunna need some proof of that claim bud
---
What did you move on to?
---
Play naked in one of those plastic swimming pools and just piss whenever.
---
"experts"
---
Those are rookie numbers! You gotta pump up those numbers!
---
Priest, warlock, or possibly warrior.
---
Gnome int racial translates to about +0.4% crit and +300-400 hundred mana w/ T2 gear. The theorycrafting and math has been done before, and the difference is a couple dps points higher on the gnome compared to the human mage. So pretty much negligible. Escape Artist (gnome racial) is good if you're super serious about pvp. But again not game-changing. You won't win many fights JUST because you had this racial, and you won't beat a more skillful opponent JUST because of it either. Also, it's worse than in later expansions because it has a cast time in vanilla.
---
Humans do have Perception (significantly boosts stealth detection) which is very situational, but useful in BGs.
---
summary: go human because that's what you like
---
Yes I know. Double the stamina means less other stats which means less power creep. You get it now?
---
Yeah, as n811 you can run faster when you are dead, you have a better stealth, i asume and you have nature res.
---
But If you are going to play pve/pvp just human, slightly less rep grind, because of +weapon you need less hit for raids, and perception helps a lot with stealth enemys. Even the increased spirit will lessen your downtimes a tiny little bit.
---
But main reason is +weapons, i did a n811 warrior and that extra hit i did need for some parts of the raidcycle where sometimes painfull because i need extragear or just could not use better gear with less hit on it.
---
n811 is more if you want to sneak around, more for a farmchar aka hunter or if you wish to use shadowmeld on you char to hide/ambush as every n811 class combo on a pvp server or for some breaks on pve.
---
I know he's an idiot, but what?
---
What he said was "were world buff meant to be used all at once? Yes though we layer discovered that was a mistake".
---
ALL AT ONCE. YES.
---
TipsOut defrauded several California governments by taking contracts, doing no work, and sending invoices for hundreds of thousands of dollars anyway. When he tried to take almost $1 million from LA county, they called him out on it and banned the company. So TipsOut called them all racists and threatened to sue the board members personally. Then a judge told him to shut the fuck up and the company went bankrupt, sending TipsOut into millions of personal debt.
---
Add Tauren extendo-arms and make it even more absurd! they're at like 10-11 yards with leeway
---
Y'all be rerollin, I'll keep rolling on this Hunter gear.
---
How good are pepperoni hot pockets? I’ve always wanted to try them but I’m not allowed to eat pepperoni
---
Yaay
---
Google "TipsOut FTR International" and find the LA County court documents. The only reason I'm not linking them is because they have his real name all over them and that's a bannable offense on Reddit.
---
yeah warrior w/ healer leveling is pretty damn nice, absolutely night and day from solo leveling
---
You say that again, but what is your definition for "urban areas" ?  
---
Most of the urban areas are small cities with literally nothing in them that would attract any internet cable company.  
---
As I said to someone else, in France, barely over 10% of the population lives in cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants. I imagine it's probably even less than that for Bulgaria. A city with 100 000 inhabitants is already small enough to not have proper high-speed internet coverage.
---
But we're levelling as BM, so no aimed shot
---
well duh, humans are on the alliance
---
Nothing.
---
I love PlatinumWoWs videos the most of any classic youtubers/streamers.
---
Bye. No one cares.
---
Yeah, that is for the low settings, the minimum speccs.
---
AMD has been know  to run exploitive benchmarks in the past. Happened with the Vega56/64. 
---
That being said, no reason to break bank for 1 game. You will easily be able to achieve the frame rate you want on most modern CPUs from the past 3 years. Also remember that an MMO (especially older ones) are more CPU(single thread) bound than GPU. Of course a GPU matters, but just not that much.
---
You’re right and adhd sperg crybabies are overreacting with “hurrdurr literally unplayable”. The beta build is behind what blizzard has internally. Even if the issues don’t get fixed on launch, they will be fixed by the time you reach 60 and have almost no effect on your 1-59 time, unless you’re in the 1% first to 60 speedrunners.
---
The mute will be over before your ticket is looked at.
---
I’m similar I don’t gank people when they are low health or anything but you can sometimes get a sense people want to fight. Or I’ll jump into a group fight. But I still plan on playing an alliance on a pve server(I’m horde) but I want to see the other side and that’s going to be my relaxing slow leveler. Probably won’t really even do anything I just wanna slowly level and level all my professions in a calm setting. I’ve never leveled in the wetlands or anywhere alliance side. Still trying to decide class race combo for that. 
---
Maybe dwarf hunter but that might just be because of the cinematic lol
---
*Latvian potato with copper electrons run from it
---
Which healer for getting into raids easy (horde)?
---
In tbc and wotlk, I raised a LOT with a resto shaman main and loved it. I'm now mainly deciding between rolling a holy priest or a resto druid for a new challenge, but I'd also consider rolling a resto shaman if that's the easiest way to get into raids.
---
I'm going to be semi-casual because of work and other responsibilities, but I want to down every single raid. I don't care how long it takes, but I want to get to the end. That's my main priority.
---
Which horde healer should I roll?
---
60fps. How quaint. You want to be playing at 120fps+.
---
You know nothing Jon Snow. Season 8 Jon Snow at that.
---
gross. meat tastes sweaty. best ones contain no meat
---
Bet OP is the "fun" guy at parties.
---
It was only that way after the TBC prepatch, sure it was frustrating, but it was a very small window of time that my guild personally just saw as a teaser of what was to come.
---
TFW You sacrifice your disobedient minion and make the problem disappear
---
#LockFeels
---
This was so good
---
I’m not your buddy, friend
---
Should’ve capped hit rating
---
Wew lad are you angry over comments made about a game that’s over a decade old?!?!
---
You're replying to someone whos mad Classic won't be fully Nostlike. Don't waste your time.
---
I would do TBC, Wrath, Legion, and MoP (in that order of priority). I would unsub during Cata, WoD, and BFA.
---
I liked MoP just because the zones were nice, and I enjoyed the classes. Legion was fun. WoLTK, good times were had. TBC was the best.
---
Those horror stories may be true but they are stories. I’ve been ganked a lot but not corpse camped that much. 
---
But if you do get pretty much insta killed on Rez just take a ten minute break they aren’t gonna hang around that long realistically
---
We get the game a year earlier then most qualified guessers thought and you think it is to long, with 1,5 month left to release. "Ok"
---
Naxx isn't even close to the greatest. Naxx40 is only remembered for nostalgia and most people didn't even do it at all. Wrath naxx was basically a rehash filler raid until 3.1 came out. There's so many better raids than it.
---
No one above 15 years old will roll on a streamer realm if they know it. Those realms will be horrible
---
Socrates was ostracized from Athens and was a pederast. Who cares what that guy said.
---
Not possible
---
We aren’t your friends home dog
---
Hmm. I thought that was after the first arrival of the orc but I may be way off. Thanks for flagging
---
The gentrification in retail wow is worrying
---
Then the hunter gets to MC and realizes you do triple his DPS.
---
Shadow priests can probably offtank for split aggro fairly confidently, given the threat generation of Vamp Embrace and Mind Blast.
---
You can read the Med'an comics, though Blizzard doesn't really consider him canon.
---
Tbh. I hope not. They would kill the hype 😅
---
resistance totems are not THAT effective, and IIRC he didn't drop resistance totems at all that I saw.(wasnt paying 100% attention I admit)
---
I don’t think that means what you think it means.
---
Everything near modern 4 GHz and a decent IPC bundled with good ramspeed (3000 CL16-16-16-36) will be sufficient to have almost everytime 60+ fps with a good and smooth frametimes on ultra settings maxed out, even in raids or highly populated places. Any specc above that should have some diminishing return aka to high cost for just minimal improvements.
---
But warr can't drop threat.
---
I dunno man, before tweaking layering, stress test servers seemed pretty fucking laggy to me.
---
When the sub hype for 8.2 ends they will release open beta for subs
---
Nah not going to happen. There is almost 0 benefit to an open beta at this point and an awful lot of negatives.
---
Potions
---
No way brother you need to stay with the light
---
Nice one, i was thinking about checking out the comics. Does she appear in any others?
---
Yea it has 5 hp so it’s a pain.  It’ll absorb a frost bolt/fire blast and have 3 hp left over for the next totem pulse
---
It's a reference to Dodongo from Legend of Zelda there's a repeatable quest from her to feed her these green plant orbs. In the game you put a bomb in Dodongo's mouth to kill him. A lot of the NPCs at Marshal's refuge are Nintendo references. Linken: Link from Zelda - He gives you a ling chain of Zelda themed quests and your rewards at the end are Linken's Sword of Mastery (Master Sword) Linken's Boomerang. Larion and Muigin are Mario and Luigi.
---
For me, it’s Ventrilo or nothing.
---
Nothing it is.
---
I don’t think.
---
 Shitting yourself, drinking Monster energy drink and eating junk food. Hardcore gamers amirite xD
---
You literally said you moved onto shit.
---
You can't be this stupid. You said you're all for banning people who talk about things that make you uncomfortable. The responsibility should fall on the people instead of the company to curate what they read. You have a mute button. I made that argument and you've yet to give any counter.
---
Mid/Late TBC is the stopping point for me.
---
No mistakes, just happy ~~accidents~~ Gnomes.
---
I thought it was funny.
---
By the way,  melees up to level 10 on pservers are bugged, on retail mobs at low level have much less Dodge and party chances , but obviously it wasn't known to private servers who used the same value for everything. It's gonna be easier
---
Similar situation for me in Aus
---
A man of culture
---
Whatever your thoughts on it, Blizz have said Leeway is working as intended :/
---
She's in a couple of the novels concerning Medivh and the First War, but I think that's it. Most of her in-game lore comes from Legion with the Rogue artifacts. There's a book you an interact with to read all about her.
---
It's for the 60fps-value! Frametime-per-money!
---
I never trust pre launch benchmarks. Sure they can show some direction but usually real life things end up to be different. I am really looking forward release (and real tests after that) as I am upgrading my CPU from i5 4670k.
---
Not a chance, they have allthe data they need and only doing a final stress test to make sure they have the amount of players per layer set for how they think is best for launch
---
Can't Trinket a fear if a Nelf priest Mind Controls you first.
---
Hm, I have two ways on how to answer to your post, cause I don't know if you understand the first one.
---
1. Well, he has a point. It really takes too long. Even for me. I was hyped, I looked at all the content that was posted by streamers and now I'm just not hyped anymore. That's how it is. It has nothing to do with "modern gamer" or "child having a tantrum". I already played Vanilla WoW the last 5 years.
---
2. You sound like a Vanilla WoW fanboy that just wants to defend it no mattter what. (Or) you're a child being oversensitive and unable to do a decent conversations. "I'm right and you're wrong" mentality will give you many problems and a lonely life.
---
I already see the downvotes for just giving my opinion on internet people :D
---
There are so many items not listed here that involve raid consumables and potions. I'm glad it isn't common knowledge lol
---
This is simply not true
---
Leeway fixed yet?
---
I played vanilla wow on a toaster. You will be fine!!
---
You can play it, but you'll have to scale some things down.
---
As if letting an horrible people roam free for a few minutes until a GM take a look is a big deal. That horrible people is gonna lose his account anyway.
---
A warrior in pre raid bis shits on a hunter in MC gear
---
Why do you need two of them? What I’m trying to say is.... can I has one?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkoHAzjnUs
---
You're such an angry young man. 
---
If you look around and everywhere see idiots perhaps the problem is you? No doubt you're very sure you're right, so sure in fact that everyone that disagrees with you must be some sort moron who probably cries if a single cornflake in their bowl is shaped like remotely offensive. "If only they could see" you tell yourself, "it's up to me, the one reasonable mind left on the internet, to help them".
---
Except it doesn't work does it? People just disagree with you and you're left with your impotent histrionics tilting at windmills.
---
But no fear, once again you journey back to the thread. "this time I'll call them stupid and I'll be sure to get through to them" keep at it jerkoffjackson you're an inspiration to the hopeless everywhere!
---
Two random videos about abusing the report system. It will completely ruin classic if the meta becomes silencing competition and banning opponents in BGs.

Ice block has a cd and the mage can't do anything while in it, he is out of the fight at that point, the opponents jsut have to remember to readjust, when the mage leaves the block. You wouldn't dispel a mass frost nova of course. dispelling is for single frost nova hits on your melees or sheep of course.
---
biggest waste of money i've wver seen lmao 
---
aka when casuals go hard for a week and lose a year of lifespan
---
after bc s3
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
I've got one last question. If I main a prot warrior could my goal be just tank the endgame dungeons? For raids, if I have the time, I plan to mostly offtank or dps because I really don't wanna commit enough to MT, but will people require post-raid gear to do the large dungeons in the long run? That's the way I've found to have my share of fun tanking while not commiting to a hardcore raiding guild
---
The speed of light does not change. The latency of cable internet has not drastically gone down since 2004.
---
Counterpoint: You're wrong
---
It will help you find locations in zones that aren’t listed on the normal maps. It also includes hand rendered maps of smaller locations that no maps exist for otherwise, and helps in locating quest givers, vendors, trainers, and mailboxes if I remember correctly.
---
Then there is useful information in the appendices as well, like what resources are in which zones, stuff on rare mobs etc.
---
The art isn’t what I would buy it for, the best looking Atlas Brady did was for Cataclysm. The other three are pretty similar in look and style.
---
Play a caster heavy meta, and those paladins wont do shit.
---
Also, a drop in average damage may be worth it for increased reliability. Easier to plan around.
---
Stop commenting like you know what you're talking about. How old *are* you? Using the speed of light (lol) as some kind of argument about the general Internet speed caps available to the average household in 2004 is *dumb.* 
---
You're reaching. You're clawing for anything just to win an argument you can't win. The fact is: Average Internet speeds from provider to home were slower than today. Learn to take an L.
---
Yep the wording is certainly ambiguous. Just another little quirk of vanilla.
---
I believe the tooltip will show the increased barrier strength, or maybe it requires an addon like TheoryCraft
---
I do that, but place the campfire on the head of the corpse of the player I just ganked.
---
Add bigger bleed dmg for rogues? Increase poison dmg... to allow rogues to play some kind of dot spec. There are ways for sure. Or at leaste make the new tiers similar in power but different in aesthetics.
---
I don't care even if they have no communty managers just take their fucking policing and censorship back to retail where it belongs.
---
Tooltips never show increase in numbers so idk 
---
And add-ons are not always accurate 
---
Sounds like it needs good ole testing
---
m8ty we've all bought those private lapdances from a female nightelves in ironforge, dont feel ashamed sharing this picture
---
I’m taking a full month off of work for this game. If there’s too many people, I’ll just play from 1AM-8AM in the crowded zones.
---
Rework the outland so that flying could be cut out and it could be great. But I still do dream about vanilla+ in 2 years time...
---
Drink water noob
---
What site is that? unknown website it says
---
Rewards are nice, good nature resistance gear for aq
---
May your blades never dull
---
You have the best of luck then, enjoy your raids. :)
---
I'm sure that most people are aware that Moonkins have (to not pick sides in the "meme-spec vs 30 warriors-and-magi-no-rogues-or-hunters-or-warlocks-or-druids-allowed" discussion) issues. 
---
Just let people play what they want, and why even care? If you're the kind of person who's hardcore enough about raiding, then odds are that you'd never raid with a spec that is, undeniably, doing less DPS than a mage anyway. So why are you so far up people's asses about it?
---
Is it for sure going to be subscribers? I feel like for the last test they will want as many people as possible to simulate actual launch.
---
Wtf...
---
There are two items with that stat: [Lightforged Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20504/lightforged-blade) from the lvl 50 paladin quest. Very rarely seen, because msot palas pick the ring or the trinket and the quest was added in 1.8, so most people were already levelled by then and couldn'T use the item anyways.
---
And [Nature's Embrace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17741/natures-embrace) a robe from a rare boss in Maraudon.
---
Apart from that, there are green "of holy wrath" items.
---
So I'm a relatively new WoW player. I missed out in vanilla unfortunately.
---
I always wondered about the class trainers, they have no purpose at all. I looked it up and learned that they DID have purpose back in the day. The talent system looks so much more fun than it is right now. I'm very eager to play classic and experience the old system and visit the trainers!
---
At the same time I learned that crafting skills did have use other than crafting bags in order to sell them.
---
Yes, there are multiboxers who do this. First squelch period is two days then doubles each time without limit. It can also lead to auto-suspensions but the specifics are a bit unclear.
---

---
I don’t know if you’ve seen the updates I’ve made to the Tool, but you can now compare spells with each other which will show you how they perform in respect to different metrics. Maybe this will prove helpful in selecting spells during leveling too!
---
If the only thing in WoW which you value is raiding, then I don't think vanilla necessarily "beats" BC.. But the whole thing is that classic is a "game" while everything that came to wow later were "expansions".
---
 There is just so much to do..
---
Unless the only thing which you value are complex/ very engaging raid mechanics, you will enjoy classic
---
Wrong. Seal of Command scales with 20% spelldmg and 29% holy spell dmg. Judgement of command scales with 43% spelldmg or 86% if the target is incapacitated.
---
Warrior or lock for classic? Help
---
Not even half way through a fight you'll realize you're going to lose - it's just a matter of time.
---
Now I'm curious, what are your preferred classes?
---
A hunter will never do top dps..if he's super geared and topping the dps metre in mc then he's wasting his time there.
---
&gt; I already played Vanilla WoW the last 5 years.
---
You played PServers. Not Vanilla WoW, not Classic WoW.
---
Yes, there are going to be factors in classic that differs from what people have dug up on private servers but generally Warriors are about 20% as effective as a druid in equal gear. Druid has some upsides to the warrior but they're very marginal or situational. 1 big argument is that druids prebis is better then warriors so they're in a pretty good position during ph1, but will start to lose after the warrior starts collecting MC gear etc.  
---
Most people wont bother with having a Druid MT, probably alot will settle with a druid as offtank but even in that position you kinda want a warrior with annihilator.  
---
So Warriors are "The" tank, they are superior in almost every encounter and environment. Druids are just an "acceptable" substitute that can work well.
---
You think you do but you don't was right after all?!
---
Well dude pserver isnt classic/vanilla. Using private servers as any example is useless because they are not correct alot of the times. Not a credible source.
---
Wow, thanks Buttgoast!
---
I seem to recall that there was a private server bug where school-specific damage applied 1:1 to all spells, so 20 fire damage would add 20 damage to Fire Blast and things like that while regular spell power would have coefficients and thus do very little for instant spells. As far as I remember, it was a confirmed bug.
---
i hope so as that would make api's display things more evenly rather than having to use hardcoded addons that tie into the key press and not the game and wouldnt be able to keep track :)
---
i am hyped for classic ^^
---
The horde had a horde only duel tournament, it would make sense to also have an ally only tournament to find the best ally duelist. That’s irrelevant to what I was saying though anyway I was talking about why the ally players were pissed off.
---
Honestly, as a Prot Warrior, your sheer existence guarantees you dungeon spots. Tanks are by far the most sought after archetype, if you manage to eventually farm a decent blue tanking set, you'll be taken into every non-raid there is.
---
? if you at least could learn how to spell it would be a massive improvement to your lack of communication skills.
---
I did this quest with two other paladins. More paladins help massively.
---
True, but in the spirit of the thread I presumed he meant classic.
---
Can someone loop me in on this? I haven't played in a while. WTF is OP talking about?
---
Lol imagine thinking that last guy is handsome. Poor you
---
great post. Almost convinces me to level one, but I have a feeling it would be 100x harder than feral and w/ a lot more drinking.
---
Somewhat of an over exaggeration. They literally just released a brand new dungeon which was very popular.
---
You couldn't even spell believe.
---
No one is advocating for min/maxed raids of 30 warriors and mages.  Every class has a place in raids.  Druids do it as healers.
---
Can I has ur stuffs?
---
You can play a warrior fine as a casual with below average gear. Sure, ppl that are geared to the teeth will faceroll you but that goes for every class, unless the matchup is downright paper vs scissors.
---
Except in not
---
EU here so no horse in the race but thanks for doing a giveaway! :)
---
people make game i dont like
---
people deserve no job and livelihood 
---
me am smart for playing classic
---
Unfortunately no. They'll go with the old riding skills, meaning the mounts cost 1000g and the riding skill nearly nothing. If you go for the class mount, you'll delay your epic mount until phase 2 and if you want to use another mount, you have to pay full price for it. All in all, also considering the class mount costs mana to use, you're probably better off to just pay the extra 300-400g for a regular mount.
---
But, if you level slowly, i.e. you haven'T reached 60 by phase 2, then I'd still go with the class mount.
---
Then you see the hunter on his shiny T1 while you still look like a ragdoll and the warr tanks get all the phat lewtz
---
This, but also, classic is only a month and a half away so not a lot of revenue to be lost here.
---
The movie is cool in a sense it brings the world alive, but as others have stated, the lore is definitely off and doesn’t follow the books or games. 
---
I’d really recommend getting stuck into the books, one of the best is the first one, ‘The Rise of The Horde’. It’s available as an audiobook too. Although, I don’t think Garona makes an appearance in that book.
---
you can believe that, there are still people out there that also believe in god, so you do you!
---
&gt; but it's actually using the most recent code now.
---
No it isn't. It has never gone to 8.1.x which is the first time WoW supported multithreading and DX12. Every time the beta client version number *does* update (has only happened a few times), I check to see if it has any multithreading support at all and it doesn't at all. There are plenty of other people on this subreddit confirming the same.
---
Post name so i can camp you
---
I wont even raid AQ LOL
---
pvp till p5 and wait for fresh Yihooo
---
Eve, thats where you completely wrong and it shows your lack of knowledge on the whole point of RP-PvP/PvP-RP.
---
The point is to provide an atmosphere, that atmosphere is driven by the fact it combines both in its title. Without, RP-PvP being present that brings the issue that PvP players will find a contingent of Roleplayers on their servers and some of them will find that rather disturbing.
---
As such it is only wise to give people the option for the best integration of communities within servers. Within the current guild leaderships, this something actively discussed in addition to us speaking with website contacts regarding if we don't get a RP-PvP server how we can work together to drive another server as psuedo RP-PvP.
---
Hes rolling horde. He used to play alliance.
---
&gt; The whole point of using the modern client was to share the code.
---
They wanted the exploit fixes which occured since Vanilla.
---
&gt; PoM Mages can actually delete players every 3 minutes.
---
LOL the "three minute mage." I totally forgot about those.
---
Well bfa subs at an all time low because people dont like it. Blizzard has lost a lot money from loss of subs. If you're responsible for losing the company money, you won't be there for long
---
yes, exactly.
---
They are getting 12 boxes of 12 and a box is $10
---
Its is? Ah okay thanks (:
---
There was so much stuff scrapped because of TBC that could have been finished... Comes into mind:
---
-Stormwind portal and prison on channel district
---
-Emerald Dream portals
---
-Kharazan basement
---
-Gilneas
---
-Azshara BG
---
-Hyjal 
---
-Portals in Stratholme
---
-Furbolg Strongholds in Felwood/Azshara
---
-Taurens plainsrunning
---
-....
---
Hunters are still good up until AQ. Then they start to fall off cause they dont scale as well with  better gear than the other classes. 
---
The high skill ceiling for pvp and the fact that you can still 1 shot people makes them super fun too. Defenitely gonna be my main for awhile, even if those issues do impact the class in a pretty significant way.
---
Yes, but that atmosphere is no longer acknowledged or protected by Blizzard (beyond naming rules). It's a free-for-all for anyone to say whatever they want, whether it's in-character or not.
---
Thats exactly the point, because thats how it is now on the beta and how its going to be when live. The system might not have changed or been reproduced more or less exactly to what it was in 2005, but the players using those system have changed drastically.
---
As I said in the tldr, a "bad" system only really becomes bad when/if people start exploiting it, when that happens it needs to be looked into and changed. Same as rightclick-report, that system itself isnt bad, but if players start abusing it for personal gains it has to go.
---
So it's justified to behave like a child and try to spoil other peoples fun because.. that? OK
---
What is the difference between RP-PvP and PvP-RP?
---
Where are the Zebra Cakes? Redbull and Zebra Cakes for launch.
---
Fucking amateurs. You build a toilet into your chair and use a microwave as a monitor stand.
---
WotLK introduced choreographed dance raids where people needed to spam their max damage/threat/heal rotation in between following the warnings of addons.    
---
That's where they lost me.  Reactive mechanics are cool when they're unpredictable.  When they're predictable and you just add more and more of them to the point where I"m running all over the fucking place during a boss fight, it just annoys me. Pattern recognition is awesome when you're playing Tekken, but pretty much shit when you're playing an MMO.
---
Jesus christ.
---
GTA V (:
---
OP judges alliance population (roughly a little more than half of everyone who plays WoW) for the actions of Asmongold fans.
---
Horde biased readers on the subreddit slam upnoodles
---
I mean if that’s how they have fun I’m not gonna put them down for that, it’s a pvp server of course people are going to grief it when they have the chance. But that’s completely irrelevant as well I’m just saying why alliance players were mad not commenting on if it was right or wrong.
---
Melee leeway seems a solution to a problem that no longer exists, or is at least greatly reduced. Perhaps it would be better to remove or reduce it. (Saying this as a non-Hunter)
---
One used to exist, the other never has.
---
Which is why I said having a community form at the start is important. Remember rules in WoW are generally propagated by the community, if it is stifled then your not gonna see jack.
---
Stifling would be basically meaning the RP-PvP communities rolling PvP etc and integrating there and then not being able to move over without damaging the other server's community.
---
Your entire guild could get banned, because it would not be hard to have a system in place to flag people for doing exactly that, and I'm sure no one has considered trying to mass-report Method during their World First runs before.
---
$500 bucks to be a slob and destroy your body.
---
Drakova is not a streamer
---
Allseeingeye is not a streamer
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, this is a pretty unique a cool icon
---
That's not it's intention. Blizzard already said more people will feel like it's overtuned than not because more people have faster internet today than in 2004.
---
That's not how people remember playing it.
---
Oi, the Lampblacks are still folk heroes to the common people of Duskwall.
---
why would you let the enemy take your resources? are you just going to stand there "go ahead ill look further ciao" or are you going to claim it for yourself?
---
your logic eludes me tbh
---
I would appreciate it. I don't want to play, but to have an opportunity to set up all the add-ons and tweak the UI before launch would be great.
---
Easy, when you are a refugee from a merged server, you get a sur name slapped on you of that old server's name.

There the same thing its a reference name for RP-PvP by some members of the more PvP heavy side. I saw its mention so i decided to include it's phrasing.

---
With all due respect its a sub phrasing used by more heavy PvPers on RP-PvP by refering it to PvP-RP. They cover their heavier preference for PvP beforehand.
---
Not that hard to understand.
---
SOME people will. You think the playerbase is equalized to a max point of skill/playtime. Lets talk again once naxx been out for 3 months and see how many clear it like lfr.
---
Itll be fine...it'd be a lot better if it wasn't using integrated video though. I'm amazed there's an i7 and no dedicated gpu
---
You'll have to turn some stuff down.
---
Poopsock and piss into the used monster cans ftw.
---
And Humans wouldn't exist at all if it weren't for all the other races that came to their aid, which many of your leaders still think should be exterminated.
---
Humans are the Nazis of WoW.
---
There are way too many people without anything to do in their lives posting on this sub
---
Additionally on warrior which really has it rough they seem to generate less rage from the attacks that do hit as well as having less health regen. Like melee leveling is pretty rough on classic but pservers are ridiculous
---
This is so true. And will be my approach. I’m only using the guide to optimise my talent points a bit as I don’t want to end up with a crippled talent tree
---
I'd probably play TBC because the expansion as a whole was very fun and they fixed some (all?) classes. I hated wotlk besides the story and I only played Cata for a month or so and also didn't like it. I would then come back for MoP and after that I'd stop until they released Classic again.
---
Though I hope that we get Classic+ at somr point.
---
Because its loads of fun dying from something out of your control.
---
It's ok buddy. You and 70% of the server population are gonna have so much fun as mages.
---
For the non-retail players, could someone have a shot at an unbiased explanation how the current system in retail/in the beta works? Because it seems a lot of aspects get convoluted.
---
I imagined right-click reporting to be mostly about chat messages - you click the actual message, and ignore&amp;report, while simple ignore is also an option. If enough people choose to report, there is an auto-mute for public channels only, possibly whispers too. Guild chat and party chat should be unaffected. Obviously, this would be same-faction only.
---
For actual cheaters using speed hacks, or botters, a separate report function would be used, which would not (only) mute but also trigger GM review.
---
Is the current system used for both purposes? Because neither muting a bot nor temp-banning some idiot for an offensive joke seem like good solutions.
---
Well I wish you the best of luck and hope you find the enjoyment you're after.
---
I'm thinking about making a guild and may allow a few people to try out non-viable specs, but they have to accept that even if they have higher EPGP than everyone they may still be blocked from taking an item from a viable spec if they're clearly inferior.
---
I think you're missing the point...
---
People that look up these guides, get enjoyment either from the endgame, or the fast leveling experience. 
---
A lot of people enjoy leveling quickly. They get a kick out of typing /played and seeing that they've gotten to Level XX in XX amount of time. 
---
If people wanna race to 60, let them. If they get burned out and quit, well that's just one less uncommitted person for us to worry about.
---
Thats the reason you dont play on the same server as Asmon. There are 3 factions in wow nowadays: horde, alliance, spergs.
---
Why would something that wasn't available until Vanilla was completely gone and isn't available in Retail today come back for Classic?
---
I recently bought F1 2019 and CTR Nitro-Fueled (I love racing), and I still play RDR2 every now and then. So that'll keep me busy for a while.
---
It was supposed to all be getting rolled into the new one. Still waiting...
---
You'll also get stuck cause your little legs cant jump high enough to get back up/out lol
---
Repeatedly disturbed the duels (attacking/healing one opponent)
---
Cataclysm. BC and WotLK are peak WoW.
---
Same situation here. Town has 50-60k inhabitants. Municipality is up to 85k. I live in the dead center of the town, not far from fiber access in every direction. But my area specifically is relatively nice, so it's mostly older people living here, ans they don't want to pay for fiber access.
---
Drakova is Esfand's best friend. Allseeingeye is a streamer. twitch.tv/trigzboss

25 year old undies
---
plz stay away with your arguments, this sub hates the truth.
---
Afaik it's 10 hours after the first person on the server ringing the gong, then you can't complete the last step any longer.
---
Even if a hardcore guild is doing weekly double MC they could still easily take the better part of a year to see a tfury.
---
Ever since classic has been announced playing retail feels like I'm playing a off brand version or like playing on a private server knowing it will not matter in two months.
---
At the moment I play Stardew Valley and Borderlands 1.
---
Those 1.2k upvotes on the osrs version insipre you to farm some karma?
---
Yes.
---
and palas have none
---
Failing to plan is planning for failure
---
That makes sense. I was just wondering as I got the impression by OP that Discord would replace in-game guild chat.
---
N811? Night eleven? Why not just type NE.
---
Hearthstone
---
Sure, it's viable, even if you had to pay for the mount. You can always make money disenchanting cheap greens and selling the dust and essences as well as making and selling bags. It won't be as profitable as gathering professions though.
---
Dropping tailoring, I don't know about, Im no expert on clothies, but I hear the bloodvine set from zul'gurub is really good, so you maybe want to keep it until phase 5 at least.
---
Regarding enchanting, you need to make you are one the guild enchanters. Most lategame enchants are raid drops, so only a few people will learn those. 
---
However, I don't know, how you plan to help your lower level characters with enchanting. You can't enchant items of your other characters, as you can't login simultanously on both.
---
Nice post Keftenk. as someone who lurks daily a bit on the classic druid discord i really apreciate this.
---
Jeah wasn't that the ice mage burst in tbc? Frostbolt-&gt;ice Lance on a frozen target for both to count?
---
Warlocks don't really need Tailoring until ZG.
---
Why would people want to play with streamers and youtubers? Just curious. If anything I’d want not to play with them? What’s this effect they have? I don’t understand!
---
What a stupid question
---
My exact spot...
---
Let him have his karma
---
Yeah, I know how it goes! Nice one, Owlman.
---
Life's hard when all your allies are... Well, allies.
---
I’d go up to and including WOTLK, started to enjoy wow less and less from that point onwards.
---
I’d be happy with just vanilla though.
---
I think ,this too overblown. There are so many raids, who is going to design all of those? In your 1.21 - 1.24 section, you have 8 raids in the span of 4 patches. Assumnig all of those raids, which I do, because the chart only shows raids.
---
Also, I feel, many of those raids are pointless. Who is going Grim batol, a raid with loot equivalent to BWL roughly 3 years after bwl release?
---
Meanwhile, a vendor white dagger at lvl19 (the level at which you can equip the cruel barb) has 11 dps. I know what you mean, but it's extremely unlikely for that to happen.
---
If somebody really had 20 ping consistently in 2004, then yes. But they didn't. So you couldn't react to somebody casting a spell, and then cast that same exact spell after they start casting it. I love that Blizzard recreated spell batching, but it's functionality is entirely different when played on 2019 internet. The window just needs to be smaller to compensate.
---
This still makes no sense. All poles show that RpPvP is more popular with Classic players than regular Rp, yet Blizzard somehow still believes that RpPvP is too niche and gives us Rp instead
---
Not having them at launch will disincentivize players to actually play on a RpPvP server later on. This is pretty much what made RpPvP less popular than Rp back in Vanilla.
---
I just hope they give us a clear yes or no on RpPvP servers at launch and if there are none hopefully they can at least give us an approximate date when we can expect a RpPvP server. It should be close after launch or not at all really.
---
No changes
---
The interview with omar and another dev which was more recrnt changed it to being considered
---
1 big flaw in your theory, why this wont be implemented  
---
Big Streamer1 goes Alliance on Thrall 1  
---
Big Streamer2 goes Horde on Thrall 2  
---
And with them a lot of people follow , becuase they want to be on streamer servers  
---
Thrall 3 is dead, and because the huge pop. on T1 and T2, its full.  
---
Now Thrall 3 is dead, and cant be merged with 1 and 2, because they are already full, voila you are on a dead shard/realm
---
could you try this? IIRC the corpse would despawn if you tried interacting with a dead pet that. so it should tricker the [nopet] on the second press. I could be wrong tho.
---
/cast [@pet,dead]Revive Pet; [nopet]Call Pet; Dismiss Pet  
---
/cast [nopet]Revive Pet
---
Melee down warriors, lol.
---
have fun with my ice reflector then.
---
Developers don't make decisions like that.

it isnt high rez, but perhaps you could turn it into a collage that needs to be observed from up close.

You can suck mine, and i can give you a 50 / 50 chance to get in the beta.
---
Of course, that's the old argument, but for the sake of discussion we assume everything else than gear to be the same.
---
Equally skilled Hunter and warrior.
---
In the sob sorry written above though the warrior was competent while the Hunter was the rail guild master son.
---
Now that is an interesting question.
---
I loved TBC, however I was in a very good guild and quite focused on raiding. With my limited time these days, I'm not sure how that would work out with a more casual approach.
---
WotLK had good and bad points. The landscape was great, although the leveling itself started to be pretty faceroll IIRC and the phases of the zones started dividing players and turned it more into a game focused around the player. As for raiding, I liked Sartharion and Ulduar with the difficulty modes. Really didn't like the tournament stuff. And blizzard really started to implement systems during that expansion that turned wow into a different game.
---
So unless TBC is just horrible as a more casual player, I'd guess somewhere during WotLK I'd quit. Kinda like I did in the first time, WotLK was the expansion where I started to take longer breaks after pretty much playing constantly before.
---
The issue is that if you RP on a PvP server, random people are going to walk up to you and be like "Ew, Rpers, look at them, lets ruin their day". They would wonder why we don't play on a RP realm.
---
Even if there is no RP chat rule enforced, the simple fact that it's called an RP realm changes everything. Go on Retail right now and compare the RP realm and any other server. On the RP realm you won't see people running around as "XxXAlliancewrecker69XxX" which might very well happen on a PvP server. Theres also random people RPing all around the world, which just doesn't happen on other servers, and if it does, theyll be mocked for it. 
---
And lets be honest: You can't really compare making an unofficial Rp-pvp realm to a regular one. New players or outside players not in the community have no Idea where the RP-PvP realm would be if it's unofficial. People who would play on that server because it's a PvP server suddenly find themself in a realm with lots of Rpers which isn't what they were looking for, creating a similar situation to the language realm debacle we just had.
---
We just need our home. Is that too much to ask?
---
Not really. The thing is that just the title RpPvP will attract a different player crowd. That is the issue. Yes RpPvPers can start a RpPvP community on a PvP server.... along with all the PvPers who have absolutely no interest in RpPvP and no respect for those who actually spent time rping.
---
On a RpPvP server a RpPvP community will form naturally. On a PvP server there will be many obstacles which might prevent a working RpPvP community.
---
Additional nonblizzlike bugs are always nice to have, I agree.
---
Sorry, but this seems like bull.
---
Because language based and a different server arcetype with special rule sets are the same thing lol. 
---
You are comparing cars and bikes with that argument
---
Just started The Witcher 3 hopefully can finish it before classic launch. Still at white orchard but what a stunningly beautiful looking game.

I thought this was a meme at first

\&gt;   Level 10: 3/3 Improved Rend, 2/5 Deflection. Class Quest for 1H. Spellbook, Macros, and UI on your first SW flight.
---
No, 2-3 hunters per raid are enough and they can be brain dead to perform their task. One semigood hunter for pulls is nice tho.
---
&gt; and ‘swap’ enchants with another enchanter in my guild.
---
Makes no sense. You can DE with a lvl 5 alt, so apart from nexus crystals and to a lesser extent shards, you don't need enchanting on oyur main to get mats to get gear for your alts enchanted.
---
When a player selects an RP-PvP server, they make a conscious decision to play on a server with an 'RP' tag. Regardless of Blizzard's policies, this makes them monumentally more likely to either contribute positively to roleplay, or to not negatively infringe on the experiences of others around them.
---
The power of a naming convention for PCs is far stronger than you credit it to be. A lot of people will interact positively, and at least somewhat in character, if they are approached. An RPer is not going to approach 'yourmomslayerx'. When you put yourself in the position of creating a name, you're on the first step to caring about your character identity. A few more interactions, and you might find yourself enjoying the casual aspects of roleplay in an RPG. Regardless of your own personal stance, a lot of RPers enjoy the naming convention simply because it helps them immerse themselves in the worlds.
---
Finally, the nay-sayers of RP, yourself included, are not providing any legitimate counter arguments. There is clearly a large body of players who *want* RP-PVP. If a large number of players want a server type that has been around since vanilla, why on earth should we suddenly have to play on a different server type?
---
Language is far more important.
---
Going mage, but can’t decide troll or UD. I aim to balance raids and battlegrounds with guildies when phase 2 comes out. 
---
Is Wotf really as strong as ppl say in pvp?
---
Is troll beserking really as strong in raids? 
---
I know it’s clearly a pvp/pve choice between them, if I’m going 50/50 is one “less bad” in both situations?
---
After that much of a monster drinking you won't probably tell the difference if you drink from the wrong can.
---
Wrong. Hunters are near top of the meters in MC
---
 Thanks for the reply. How much for 300 riding skill? Was it 100g? ( -10g rep discount because of 10% cheaper vendor prices I assume?)
---
 
---
 Tried to google it but finding some conflicting info. Can't remember myself what I payed.
---
Its old news from last month.
---
It is all unconfirmed so far. Kind of have to wait to see how much of it its actual specifics turn out to be true.
---
Yeah, a game Dev wouldn't have that intense insider knowledge into management imo
---
So, you are talking about absolute high end reading by top guilds? Which means, it doesn't matter at all. Besides, I'd still like to see a general classic setup of a top raid with 8 shamans.
---
So I can DE up to a reasonable level of mats with my lvl 5? Thanks for letting me know. I’ll have a think about it and decide what I’m going to do.
---
Why do you Le redditers put a fuckin smiley on the end of negative sentences for? I don’t get it legit question

I played WoD on my late 2011 mob without any issues.

Private Server and Rocket League
---
But following a leveling guide like that and getting to cap quickly IS fun for me. This sub has a weird fucking fixation on "just play to have fun!" while ignoring that a lot of people **have fun by going fast**.
---
&gt; "Ew, Rpers, look at them, lets ruin their day".
---
That happens on Retail RP servers.
---
The name thing is the only difference.

&gt; We just need our home. Is that too much to ask?

Yes. Your numbers are needed elsewhere. Splitting the playerbase has consequences.

You keep compairing retail RP realms to what will become RP realms on classic, with the reason that they stopped enforing RP-rules. We both know retail is a whole other beast. The major thing that people, including you and me, are waiting for with classic is going back to a community driven game.  
---
Ergo: Having an official RP-PvP realm means most of the people being there want to be there. Just because there's no enforcing of RP rules by mods doesn't mean it's going to be a shitfest: Trolling RP'ers on an RP realm mainly occupied by RP'ers? Probably gonna give you a bad time. Sure you won't get banned, but you will get blacklisted.   
---
Also, you're reasoning works just as well on ANY RP realm PvP or PvE, trollers will troll. So according to your logic we can't have any because people are shit. Then why play the game at all, people are shit anyway, right?
---
So your logic is:
---
Put a monkey on meta spec and put a good player on a meme spec, therefore it is viable. Enh is a mathematically bad spec, and good players absolutely realize that trying to "put more effort into" is like trying to turn grandpa's rusty truck into a racing car. A good tank player will outdps enh from phase 2 and so on.
---
You can go full nerd mode with pummelers as feral, tryhard as hell and make some use of spriest but not enh. It is a waste of slot which takes loot but does not contribute accordingly to the raid. I could understand people who played these specs during original vanilla since the game was live and the tables might have turned any patch (which basically happened in TBC), but it is 1.12 and we know exactly what we are getting.
---
drine
---
So you are writing this post every day now?
---
Im just gonna comment on the language realm part of your post, I agree with the rest.
---
First of all: it’s German, not Germain. :)
---
French and German are the two most spoken native languages in Europe (not counting Russian) and make up a decent chunk of the wow population. It somewhere between 15 and 20 % German and 10 to 15 % French. So the question is: how many people will the be in Europe that play classic in the long run? Personally 100k seems like a very low estimate, but let’s roll with it. Now using the above mentioned rates, we‘ll have at least 15k German and 10k French players. This is enough for at least two servers each.
---
You might argue 100k is too much, and you might be correct. We won’t know until the time has come. My personal opinion is that we will have way more than 100k players in Europe, who will play for a few years.
---
they can but it's normally considered a waste of a CR
---
Yeah and your point was that most people had such latency back then, when that is just talking out of your ass with no data. The latency is not equal to bandwidth. I played whole vanilla with 56k dial-up and my ping was 50-100ms whole time since I live in country that is 1000-1500km away from Germany where servers were located.
---
So your request to change spell batching is based on you having lower latency. But what about all of us who already had lower latency back then? It will feel different for us if you change this.
---
Dear Justsomespecial, I meant to write you sooner but I’ve just been busy
---
And here's an invite for you and your brother too
---
I wrote it to you through whisper 
---
I'm sorry I didn't see your application, 
---
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to not include you
---
But what’s that shit you said about leaving your life and sub fee as well as your soul at the bottom? 
---
That sorta shit makes me not wanna send an invite to you.
---
Guides weren't written for anybody. They were written to promote the creator, or advertise the site its placed on.
---
It might hurt hype but they really should. There are tooooons of bugs in closed beta unaddressed. What are they gonna do when their fixes for those things have edge cases causing other bugs?
---
Yepp Struth oath.
---
That's a side effect that only works if the guide is any good.
---
Then why will there be Rp servers which are not as popular with the Classic WoW community than RpPvP servers?
---
So, you have absolutly missed the Point completely. 
---
Pvp realms in General are a shit storm of "meme kids" and douches. And said players don't bother with rp realms sinces its eightet "bellow" them or their childish behavior won't fly there. 
---
That is a very strong reason why we need just 1 rp-pvp realm (realisticly having more will lead to ghost towns)
---
Turns out facing genocide from religious fanatics makes people desperate.
---
You keep telling yourself that, but fact is:
---
Humans have been invaded and systematically slaughtered by alien invaders. Did not kill those invaders after defeating them, but allowed them to live.
---
Those invaders then escaped imprisonment and attacked *another* indigenous people while colonising another continent. Humans did not punish them. After a free years of truce, those invaders attacked not only the indigenous people of Kalimdor *again* in a brutal war of extinction due to a belief of racial superiority, but also ordered their allies to attack human cities in Northern EK. All of those were completely wiped off the face of the earth, including all civilians. Those who have not been killed outright were tortured and killed in horrific experiments later.
---
Those invaders later detonated the equivalent of a nuclear warhead on the city of the one human leader that killed her own father in order to secure the invaders' freedom.
---
After this war, the warmongers' capital has been sacked, but a complete amnesia has been given to their former allies. Conquered lands have not been demanded back.
---
After another short truce, these former allies have convinced the bloodthirsty aliens that they need to finish their work and completely extinct the indigenous people of Kalimdor, to which the Orcs happily agreed.
---
So, who is the Nazi again?
---
Man dude, you're so negative, lighten up jfc haha.  I'll give you a pass though, Eve Classic sounds like a great idea
---
The plate tectonics of azeroth is pretty crazy woth all those mountain chains
---
It doesn't matter for hunters, if you go for Aimshot+Autoshot out of the blue in early game.. the enemy is probably dead with Aim+Auto. He can't even get to you and if he is surviving the first shots, the pet is cming for ya. A big red boar will charge you and you will get gored. :D
---
It absolutely does NOT happen to the same extend as it does on regular PvP servers. People who roll on a RP server know what theyre in for and act accordingly, for the most part. Usually RPers are left to do their thing. That does not apply to normal servers.
---
For the numbers thing... really? And Pve and RP/Pve servers are fine and dandy or what?
---
In one of the last blue posts they said they are still considering which server types to have for EU. They have never given us a clear no on RpPvP since the WoW summit.
---
The polls aren't really as valuable as the actual player numbers. There have been far more RP players than RP-PVP players at every moment in WoW's history.
---
And that is why we need em back in classic since retail won't provid it anymore
---
&gt; Don't call someone a liar when you don't know the facts.  
---
Hahahaha, how can you know if it is a fact when the game isn't released yet.  
---
It was not even available in the beta.   
---
And adding "confirmed by many" to a guessing doesn't make it a fact ;)
---
&gt; For an extreme example, look at early caster class gear with agility on it. There is no way devs at Blizzard now or then would intentionally put a stat on items that is useless for the intended class.

That's negligible compared to sword/mace expertise, though.

Can you link a post of a blue who said this?

I know youre memeing but in just in case, chat bubbles is client side so private server client is more real vanilla than classic is in terms of graphical stuff

---
You won’t be seeing the same people at the beginning anyways. There will be so many people who’ll just try it out. Quite a few will leave the game rather quickly, thus you won’t see them again. But, with layering you will have a decent levelling experience, while ensuring that the server population does not decrease to low levels.
---
Layering still has its flaws, but if the major ones get fixed I think it’s worth it.
---
TL:DR;
---
If you don't have fun leveling as fast and efficient as possible, then do not do that.
---
Lok'tar brother! Welcome to the correct side.
---
I thought it was bs last month and I still do now
---
&gt; They have never given us a clear no on RpPvP since the WoW summit.
---
Blizzard isn't fond of repeating themselves. They've said no once already.
---
That's absolutely retarded. So it's basically the worst of both worlds. Inauthentic and they have to maintain two separate code bases (yikes).

Ping is entirely dependant on the connection speed, the quality of someone's Internet service provider, the protocols used, and their firewall configurations.

All these things were distinct than in 2019 and caused worse overall ping-rates **fifteen years ago.**
---
&gt; The average person playing games like 1.6 and quake did not have 200 ping
---
Another claim with no source. Please stop pulling these “facts” out of your own ass.
---
the good old days of ventrillo :D
---
We don't know what the 3600's performance is yet.
---
Not necessarily. I myself work IT in a very large organization that utilizes alot of shared document storage spaces on file server areas. Perhaps this blizzard employee had access to alot of these networked storages, maybe with notes from different team meetings etc.
---
We dont even know for sure its a dev, might be someone higher up.

It's called "passive aggressive"

This has been posted before, and 4chan isnt a credible site.

They have given 10.000 so called leaks and 2 of them have proven to be right.

Also repost
---
Eve Classic is a good idea though. The only way to fix a sandbox like this is by resetting it (well, and change alpha clones because the botting problem is way too big). There's so much time and money invested in that game by players though, people would rather go down with the ship than seeing their progress removed
---
Everyone has been known to run exploitative benchmarks starting from Nvidia and certainly not ending at AMD or Intel.
---
If we assume it is a legit leak, blizzard may change their plans depending on the public reactions to the leaks aswell.
---
You guys honestly think private servers are more correct than blizzard servers?
---
Let me help you:

Utter bullshit. Classic is so easy you can clear MC with only shaman melee dps if you have more than 2 brain cells atleast.  
---
Unfortunately 80% of WoW community has only 1.
---
that is amazing
---
\^ this
---
I really hope this sub ends up like the OSRS one. Minus all the drama. But it's Blizzard, and with Blizzard there must always be a fuck up.

A blue post confirmed that it was disabled for beta but it's going to be in Classic, straight from retail.

Five people right-click report you for "harassment" or "spamming". Suddenly you're disconnected and when you log back in, you're silenced and can't communicate with anyone. On retail people have been squelched for months since it doubles each time with no limit. It will also be used to silence anyone that others disagree with in general chat for example. It's a big weapon.
---
Survival hunter was 1.12 the best pve spec by far.
---
&gt; most people are saying after BC
---
&gt; that's when the game's sub numbers started dropping
---
mfw wotlk had way more subs than tbc
---
&gt; until you unlock your hit % talents
---
Just an FYI, rogues are the only melee class that gets hit % talents.
---
The biggest problem here is that there is no official information how the system will actually work in Classic.
---
This is just spreading rumors and misinformation.
---
I think I still haven't seen the biggest argument for RP-PvP realms in any of these discussions: "Why not?"  
---
Because for language-specific servers the "why not?" is obvious: An Italian community would be too small for the realm to stay alive, and no other players would join an Italian server.  
---
But sticking an RP-PvP tag on the server doesn't mean 'non-RPers' wouldn't join. After all it's still a PvP server and everyone is speaking the same language. The server isn't going to die quickly because the community is too small.  
---
Since RP rules aren't enforced by Blizzard anymore, there's literally no reason (I can think of anyway) to not retag a planned PvP realm to an RP-PvP realm. It doesn't require any effort on their part and the server is still going to get its fair share of people joining regardless of the tag. And the simple fact that the server will have a large RP-Community will mean RP-rules will get 'enforced' anyway, because a lot of people adhere to it and those that don't will not get a pretty shitty reputation.
---
&gt; Innervate is yours in this day of age 
---
not my experience at all last year when i was raiding... our guild wasn't tryhard but we weren't idiots by stretch either.  had to give away innervate and battle res PLENTY
---
10/10 title
---
Minutes? It could be days until a GM can look in to it since they don't have many people on staff.
---
Same, I joined one through the recruitment thread a few weeks back.
---
It increased my hype through the roof and now I'm burning up waiting :(
---
Yeah it won’t be funny for at least another 15.3 years
---
&gt; We don't know about the server side.
---
&gt; If it is a client side check, then pservers should behave exactly like the beta because private servers do use the official 1.12 client. However, they don't behave like beta.
---
🤔
---
You can DE everything with 1 skill. The skill requirements for disenchanting came with 2.0
---
NICE
---
Tailoring/Skinning is always a solid choice. Especially in the early days of the server for bags. Robe of the Void later on isn't half bad either.
---
And like you said, it only depends on mobs not nodes.
---
I want a Kodo on my undead but on the other hand no way I am willing to skip Tirisfal and Silverpine. Pretty hard decision what to do, not sure if I want to do green quests. I still might lol.
---
Dude, you're the one that's bad. Hunters wrekt face in PvP. Only hard classes were Warlock/Shadow Priest... and paladins too tanky but they coulnd't kill you. In raids all the healers from my guild loved hunters... youre right next to them all and I'd always pull angry mobs off them. Utlity? Hunters can freeze trap mobs other players can't, and if you have half a brain or more you can trap 2-3 at once.
---
Thank you for recommending
---
cant wait to play my dwarf mage
---
Yeh, that's where I am at now. We'll see if anyone else has anything. Cheers for the reply
---
Very well put. We're literally only asking for **one** server per region. It's not even a commitment from Blizzard at that point, so why can't they just give us the server type we want to play on?
---
You definitely want tailoring for Robe of the Void and later on ZG set bonus
---
Part of learning rogue is learning when to disengage to drop bleeds with some LOS kiting etc.
---
You can make things easier with luffa and stoneskin but you will still be learning disengages since they have cooldowns.
---
The stoneform just gives you ways to drop when you otherwise wouldn't be able to.
---
Drakova is really close to Esfand, and all seeing eye is a streamer, just a smaller one.
---
Sure there are a few people in retail who haven't been stopped by it but those people are now banned so it doesn't matter all that much to me. 
---
A group of people from my previous guild tried to get me banned by mass reporting me during the early days of the system, I got in contact with a GM and I haven't seen those people online since so they're probably all banned. Serves them right, toxic pricks.
---
Apology not accepted, back on your boat alliance scum!
---
Thanks for telling me how I'm allowed to have fun
---
the paladins got gutted for like most of their offensive spells. they completely changed their toolkit and many people hated them for that, because until the change, the paladin was more like diablo-paladin than a autoattacking noodle
---
Cheers for the guide!
---
For off-race mounts, does it make sense to grind green quests or should I just stack up on silk cloth for the rep?
---
Working on my backlog! Right now it's GTA IV and God of War. After those I'll start with Bioshock and Spiderman.
---
Bless you.
---
I've been waiting 10+ years, another month won't hurt.
---
Like others have said, people find enjoyment out of different things.
---
 Regarding leveling guides, for those that like myself don't plan to level super fast they can still be useful I would imagine. I'm going to play Alliance which I haven't done since back in original classic. Tried it a little bit on a private server but basically just the first couple of zones. Could be just because I know all horde quests so well but found Alliance to have a crazy amount of running back and forth between zones the first 20 or so levels. Didn't experience that as much playing horde. Stuff like getting all the quests for Deadmines, buying 4 drinks from inkeepers etc. 
---
 Because of that I'm going to check up some leveling guide or just do the groundwork myself and type down how I should order the quests and zones for the first 20 levels. And as I wrote I don't plan to try and level fast at all it's just annoying if you are spending to much time traveling back and forth in the beginning of the game.
---
I play really casually so I can‘t tell you that much about it but I really enjoyed leveling a Hunter it‘s fun. And the Troll Hunter Animations are cooler than the org ones in my opinion.
---
They're a fun class to play. Great in pvp, soloing, 5 mans. There will be stiff competition in end game. There are way more hunters than raid positions, so the most skilled will get those slots in serious business guilds. In most guilds though , you'll do just fine if you are pleasant and helpful. Pick the race you enjoy the most.
---
It would be interesting, but don't be fooled, they will NEVER create additional content (aka NEW, never designed before) for Classic. More than the fact it would be awkward for Blizzard to develop two WoW parallel games, it would also kill retail.
---
Only probable thing (but I personally doubt they will do it) would be to roll out older expansion like TBC, WOTLK etc.
---
&gt;  the people most likely to play PC games over the internet had already upgraded by then.
---
The DSL connections at the time still swung heavily between 90-140+ ping rates on a good day. Oftentimes spiking above that.
---
Your entire premise is simply untrue. The fact remains: **Average ping rates and stability are higher in 2019 than they were in 2004.**
---
How many more comments are you going to make refusing to take the L on this, kid.
---
Literally the only reason to play alliance is if you wanna have a character look like you irl. Humans. Aside from that, its clearly the inferior faction. For the wild, for the honorable, FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Old Av was a popular part of vanilla, what are you talking about?
---
Shhhhhhh..... don’t let the secret out.
---
You and I are on the EXACT same page. I mained warrior in Vanilla, was going to in Classic. Decided on Hunter because of exactly this. 
---
Are you reading my brain? Stop it.

No wonder people are quiting beta

it's sound hilarious :D
---
Lol? Alrighty then, not really sure this was worthy of a reddit post but hey I've seen worse.
---
Check any poll or private server data. Youll see its top 3
---
I'm going to be really sad if we don't get one RP-PvP realm. I simply don't understand either; it's very evident from the polls that RP-PvP is 3 to 4x more popular than RP, so why do they get something and we don't...
---
Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/
---
Tailoring for a Warlock is not optional when ZG hits. You need Bloodvine.
---
Engineering is an obvious 2nd pick if you plan on doing any pvp.
---
Literally just one server would suffice. We desperately need this. Just change one of the RP or PVP servers to be a PVP-RP and it's job done.
---
/who only shows your faction so if you are horse it won't show alliance and vice versa
---
But everything else being the same class matters.
---
Neat
---
If the chat bubble is the worst of your bug issues then your going to have a smooth ride in classic.
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
All we ask is for you to add the RP-tag to one of your prepared PvP servers - it tends to scare most toxic players away.
---
Ehhh if they are someone else is shacking hard.
---
Seriously read the talent you recommended, there is a question to ask, Frenzy remove 2 points, will it be better to add to Endurance?
---
Thanks for the guide. I thought riding skill was like 100 g for lvl 60 mount, apparently I remembered it wrong. Interesting that it only costed 20 g.
---
Well that's cool, they do exist :o
---
There are scenarios where it is better to only use one weapon as a rogue.
---
it got changed in a later patch but we are using the system before that
---
it's not the batching, infact if you look at old videos from vanilla you will see that once the trap is placed and armed it is almost impossible for someone to "dodge" it.
---
You can see this by warriors getting frozen by traps mid charge and if it was a possible to dodge it via a 400ms window it would have happened quite a bit but in reality the only way it would fail is if it resisted.
---
Just that obviously you want a different game than classic wow. You want radical and unpopular changes when the prevailing opinion is to #nochanges. If you like changes you'll love retail wow.
---
Yeah im going with the light food and water approach this is not a race its a marathon
---
Melee leveling is only hard up until lvl 20-ish when you can get your hands on the first blue weapons. After that just upgrading your weapons through dungeons will make it smooth as butter.
---
By contrast, I still think hawk is more important than Spirit Bond.
---
Levelling a hunter is really easy and fun (at least in my oppinion). You simply breeze through the content, can solo a lot of elite quests and in general hunters are not frowned upon in 5 man content. Being a ranged class and having CC abilities.
---
I would not worry too much about raid spots. If you take your time levelling you will probably do quiet a few dungeons and will meet the same like minded people repeatedly during your levelling journey. You will most likely join a guild and make friends. Most casual guilds will be more than happy to take anyone on raid night if they are somewhat knowledgeable and can be counted upon to show up prepared.
---
If you want to PvP Orc might be better due to the stun resist racial but if you prefer the Troll animations just roll Troll. In the grand scheme of things it won't make too much of a difference for casual play. Play what you enjoy the most!
---
I appreciate ur patience in having to repeat the same message 5 times to people who just aren't reading what ur saying
---
I agree this needed to be said for all the try hard gamers that never played vanilla. Leveling is the best part of the game. 
---
There needs to be a fast but not too fast leveling guide.
---
Nope. Only things left to test are 40-60 zones and raids.
---
All of those are confirmed being tested internally. Open beta is unneeded. Last layering test at the end of July is the only data they apparently still need for EU + NA and then it's bug fixing and minor changes until August.
---
If you were intending to spirit res at the westfall graveyard I believe you will be teleported back to the graveyard closest to where you originally died. Fairly sure this was implemented to stop people doing this.
---
Paladin also. Precision is in the Prot tree, each point gives 1% chance to hit up to max of 3%.
---
This is going to be my personal plan:
---
Skinning and enchanting while leveling. 
---
Skins while leveling is simply extra vendor trash. Enchanting will only be used for disenchanting saving all materials on bank alt for later.
---
At 60 i will keep skinning until i have enough gold for my epic mount (might even try to focus on farming devilsaur, depends on how messy it will be)
---
By the time i have my epic mount and raiding progress is starting (we are still far away from BWL being released) i will drop skinning for tailoring. and hopefully i will have good enchants that will be my main income source.
---
 but im never gonna spend time or effort on Robe of the void. compare robe of the void with robe of winter night? and also in ZG you will upgrade to bloodvine set that you are going to use forever.
---
By the time ZG is released i will most likely have an alt with herbing
---
1 hunter should be used in bg premades.
---
Hunter is needed in raid for Tranquilizing Shot, I think 2 hunters is needed for it, maybe 3.
---
For pvp I would go orc hunter.
---
based and bogpilled
---
They were not hubs though. Literally every 70 was in shattrath.
---
Thanks bro! Appreciate your reply
---
Can confirm
---
Every survey here says otherwise. 
---
Private server =\= classic
---
&gt; Drakova is really close to Esfand 
---
So? The point still stands. Even worse, you conveniently forgot about that to fit your narrative of streamer only tourney.
---
If you can make sure that you have access to the crafted wands early, then tailoring/skinning is a solid choice. If not (due to it being a fresh server), you could start off with tailoring and enchanting to get to lesser magic wand asap and then drop enchanting to pickup skinning.
---
Personally I would go tailoring/enchanting and keep it this way, you have your mount at 40 secured and don't really need any gold until 60.
---
I'm looking at druid as well. The heart of the wild + natures swiftness lets you play heals or tank in the one spec and is also strong for pvp. You just need to carry the gear and remember to switch it for whatever content your doing.
---
Jones dude...jones
---
Really wish this was in real life.
---
I'd love to see their confirmation of auto squelch. So far they confirmed that a report function still exists for classic.
---
Wholeheartedly agree with this. We need just one RP-PVP server. Not having the option is a big disappointment and will effect my/our community :(
---
Feign is not on gcd.
---
Might wanna add the source.
---
Ypu'd be better served eating the cardboard sleeve. Don't eat hotpockets
---
Part of me does think it's a tactic to boost hype last moment for Classic. If so......it will work.
---
The general rule is to just farm stuff and sell on AH instead of going for the actual materials yourself.  Find something to farm that you actually enjoy and just keep doing it a lot whenever waiting for ppl or just in-between activities, once good at farming something and learning herbs/veins spawn behaviour you might be able to reach up to 100g per hour depending on material demand (content phase) on the server.
---
nah, on hope new server
---
Gear is useless if your class is shit though.
---
Both talents are RNG dependent and premed is a clearly superior talent to ruthlessness. Relentless IS nice but a luxury, not a mandatory ability.
---
true, I guess for people who **really** care about the race to 60 the other faction matters as well ... 
---
on PvE servers you could gather data by switching to a char of the other faction every once in a while, but I actually wrote some code earlier to prevent this from accidently happening xD  
---
I'll think a bit about it ... but I guess the only workable option would require a player from each faction to export their data and exchange it through some out-side-of-game way ... :S
---
If the values are off, they're not off my much. Private mobs may be a bit more punishing because they tend to refresh the shield as soon as it expires, which - if my memory doesn't betray me - wasn't necessarily the case in retail Vanilla, where you often were allowed a breather before they recast. Also, I think in Vanilla, the shield has an internal CD of two seconds ore so before it can damage again, and I think that this also is something that not every private server adheres to.
---
Those trolls on the Echo Isles are *brutal*, wherever you play, though.
---
Yes. Iron Counterweight will work in Classic.
---
How stupid are you, honestly..?
---
really enjoying Platinums content, even tough he is a filthy Alliance
---
The problem is that the things which ruin the class the most are considered to not be bugs and Blizzard has no intention of changing them.
---
lol!
---
Oh wait. You were serious? 
---
LOL !!!!!
---
Private server and XCOM2:LW.
---
&gt;It's still game changing though and to pretend it isn't is being naive.
---
That statement is so ironic... It's literally not game changing. Because that's how the game was. It's game changing compared to private servers.
---
&gt;Say priest in 1.12 couldn't heal like it was just fundamentally broken. Extreme example, but it sets a precedent. 
---
No, hypothetical extreme examples with no base in reality do not set a precedent.
---
Your class performed better on private servers in PvP. You want to have that private server behaviour in Classic too. The original behaviour is not gamebreaking. Essentially you are asking for your class to be buffed in PvP in Classic. If anything, THAT would set a precedent.
---
If you had REAL examples of other class mechanics that have a post-1.12 behaviour, your argument would make a lot more sense for hunters to recieve post-1.12 behaviour too. 
---
--- a bit offtopic ---
---
You're shooting yourself in the foot repeatedly. You're constantly exaggerating. You aren't choosing your battles. You become the boy that cried wolf.
---
You (and a lot of other hunters) also spend A LOT of time debating a private server behaviour that would buff your class in Classic. Even when you admit that private server behaviour will never make it into Classic.
---
If I were you I would look at my list. Put a red/orange background on the issues that are crucial. Keep the grey background for the issues I could learn to live with. Completely remove the issues that I know aren't bugs, eg remove the "wishlist" items.
---
&gt;A feign death+trap macro will easily fix your second point.
---
The issue is there's a delay with dropping combat, you can have your macro and spam it but it will not remove the current ~0.5s-1s delay that you have to wait to place the trap. In Vanilla, combat would be dropped immedietly, so this needs to be adjusted/fixed.
---
&gt;All of your other points I remember were a part of vanilla. If something was changed with a later patch in vanilla then it more than likely will be in classic. Every class has their own issues to deal with, it’s just part of it. There is not one class that is perfect with no issues or quirks to work around.
---
Yeah, there's just an ever growing list of grievances that hunters have that is just chipping away at the viability of the class, I understand the frustration and that's why a lot of players are moving away to play other classes where the issues are a lot more minor. 
---
&gt;If your wanting things changed from what they used to be then classic may not be for you.
---
I don't even play the class, nor do I intend to. I was just answering someones question, not asking for changes.
---
Dude eat healthy and drink water if your going to play long wow hours... you'll perform much better
---
Crit helps them keep up Improved Shadow Bolt from their destruction tree.  Which increases shadow damage from NON Periodic shadow damage by 20%. And with beta testing, we learned Shadow Oil doesn't consume stacks of ISB.
---
So not only does crit increase the warlocks DPS, it also buffs raid wide dps for anyone using the shadow oil.
---
Lol you have never leveled a rogue if you think bandages during gouges are enough to sustain.
---
Yup. There are a lot of REALLY good pvpers on alliance in the beta. Hearing we're gonna have an alliance duel tourney we all looked forward to it.
---
Then it ended up being the same fucking streamers as the last one, and a totally mismanaged shitshow. 
---
To be fair we DID wait until afterwards to start killing everything in sight.
---
There absolutely is a delay between feigning and being able to get up and place a trap, the trap has a trigger time too. It was super inconsistent in classic and good hunters just scattered it if they had scatter because why risk losing everything over a 30 second cooldown after you just trapped them anyway.
---
Whenever I'm running from a mob I spam /yell just like I'd do IRL.
---
If a priest mind controls an enemy player, can a player of the priests faction heal said enemy? Eg can you try to save a member of the opposite faction from being ganked?
---
I haven’t played wow for about a decade
---
Tauren warrior boogie man :(
---
This applies up to level 30, not level 10 :)
---
Dota, City Skylines
---
8.2 and HS
---
bold of you to think that any form of pvp has caused forced homogenization when blizzard has never given a shit about pvp
---
If you think this will be the case you think classic will fail. If we only get the hardcore base playing for years and getting easily though BWL + AQ40 this game is to small. Don't forget how casual vanilla was and is. I guess 50% neven even killed a single boss in MC. BWL clear was max 20% if not lower. No way the majority clears Naxx unless this game fails miserably.
---
I believe there was a post on here of a guy who invested in various setups to see what the required specs would be to play the game and his worst setup ran the game relatively fine without any real issues depending on the settings you have. His builds were pretty freaking awful IE: mobos from 8 years ago with 2GB RAM etc. So you'll be fine.
---
Well it's not like there's an application process for the beta.
---
I don't think rppvp servers will be popular at all. What is even the point of RP servers. Please explain.
---
this, I love watching streamers but it was funny that there were like two or three "new" faces and the casters were like "omfg we dont know this guy, he is good" ... ofc you don't know him and guess what, there are tons of people that are good but you decided invite the same people as the last time    
---
   
---
oh and btw, you can run tourny and people can donate to the prize pool. if you would actually want to do that, lwt me know. I'd help you with organization and tip some $$$ too
---
It's already been updated, among other things from the beta, on the most recent server(s) to provide a better training ground.
---
Grim Dawn and path of exiles with some buddies. Also some Scum. Once classic comes out, all other games will probably never be touched again.
---
Does a free action potion make you immune to grenades?
---
ye, there wasn't an armory in classic and there hasn't been any official word on it as far I as can find ...
---
afaik the armory nowadays is pretty fast, but the previous version of armory wasn't at all and it may or may not be dependant on changes made to during legion/BfA...  
---
regardless, armory data, at best, only updates when you logout and ofc you can't have access to it ingame, so the addon will always be useful \^\_\~
---
This actually works? You just run around and explore?
---
The difference between the players in maga and alpha beta fish is dramatic. Our guild has 930 on beta, and I've never had to admonish anyone or gkick as an officer. 
---
Maga is full of constant fights in /g and drama. Despite our sizes being very close our members behave very different. We've assembled to help out random people a lot, and everyone is just super chill. They even put up with my talkative ass
---
&gt; RP-PvP/PvP-RP is the glue that brings together players from both PvE, PvP and RP allowing for players to experience the whole game
---
How? I mean, as a PvE player with an interest in RP, what do RP-PvP realms do to bring me together with PvPers? Is there some sort of add-on that lets me tag "not interested in PvP" (but why then would I roll on a PvP server?), or "please don't gank".
---
I mean, I am all for RP-PvP servers being a thing - simply because there are PvPers out there that also like roleplaying, and because there are roleplayers that want the added immersive thrill. But maybe I'm just stupid, but I don't see how RP-PvP servers bring PvE players together with PvPers - other than as easy prey.
---
Uhm... I see these questions pop up quite regularly. But isn't sharding supposed to take care of this?
---
*"Your Sinister Strike hits..."*
---
Then I didn't miss the point at all.
---
I said that people should play the way they wanna play, and if that means speedleveling then thats not a problem at all.
---
What I'm trying to convey, is that pretty much all the leveling guides are speedleveling guides, with optimized pathing and everything. And I don't want people to think that speedleveling is the only way to play the game, or that you're somehow doing something wrong by not following these guides.
---
I for example am not interrested in speedleveling, and I watch plenty of these guides. There's lots of valuable information even for those not racing to 60. They just rarely mention that its perfectly fine to want to play the game at a slower pace.
---
Its just a very good item for tanking feral druid and since i dunno how much i will be raiding im just planning ahead :)
---
Oh you meant the actual font. Right.
---
Oh I thought you meant mobs with the same nane and varying levels. 
---
Conceivably an addon could generate a uuid for each mob in sight, but it'd be very limited. There's likely a unique id serverside but afaik it's not accessible in the api.
---
I dont think WoWs subscriber numbers at its peak were ever sustainable regardless if every expansion was an improvement.
---
I suicide when I get into Stormwind territory, then run from there, but what you mention are all perfectly plausible.
---
do you need to have played the other witchers to understand the storyline and characters? i want to play it but this puts me off
---
I'm eu, nothing will stop me to play for 24h... already promised to stream for my friends so they have shit to watch whole they are at work
---
But it was a mistake. They would have patched it out if vanilla would not have ended. At least dragon buff is on a timer. It was intended to stack but not the whole raid every time all stacks. This I borderline abusing. It's not amoraly or anything, just not good for the game and error. It should be fixed. That's all.
---
The new one really irks me, it's so out of place. Literally unplayable. I really hope they fix this for launch.
---
That makes sense. I forgot the armory only updates after you log. Super cool addon though!
---
So many reasons to pick sham, none of them are winning lvl 40 duels.
---
Thats exactly what i Said and thus posted a Screenshot from Vanilla to further prove OPs Point.
---
\&gt; But keep your illusion that Vanilla was the only good thing in all WoW history. Whatever. 
---
I don't know why you've decided that this is my opinion ;) Though I agree that TBC was a logical improvement in terms of class mechanics.   
---
By the way, why people hate arena so much?
---
There is no epic riding skill in the version we're playing in. Only faction specific riding skills such as Horse Riding, Wolf Riding, Kodo Riding, etc exist.
---
Which talent spec would you use for this with your current knowledge of the Beta?
---
I have a priest leveling guide a bit like this. Its more about optimal specs for different leveling play styles. Not strictly about the fastest every leveler if you never join a group or log off. 
---
It is about optimization, but also about what specs are useful while leveling and why. Where there are good quest rewards, and how the priest generally works as a class. 
---
Defcamp (sp?) i think and another dude do great work on this with shamans as well. (And while i maintain that resto shamans are the worst healing spec levelers in the entire game, one of them encourages people to do it anyway.)
---
Here is my reposted guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bfvml0/a_good_classic_priest_leveling_guide/

The double firelord pack in MC is pretty much a raid boss.

Honestly, to all the downvoters, what is your motivation for downvoting this thread? Give me one valid reason. It's like you want a sandwich with cheese for lunch and your collegue tells you: *I don't want you to have cheese, eat a sandwich with ham*. Damnit let us have the sandwich of our choice and mind your own business!
---
LOVE that game. Finally a mainstream video game that has the guts to be difficult, and not provide any easier option to complete it. Can't get further than 42% but it's still my favourite game of 2017.

wait wait so you bought 180 can of monster? how many days of vacation were you able to get you bastard !!!!

---
All the time? No clue if Germans behave that much differently, but there's no change from current times to the past. People say whatever they want.
---
Jesus, I hope you're having a good day, man. It is absolutely valid to criticize his calculations for their faulty foundation. You don't have to look for excuses for this either. "Faced with shitty data"? Not only is there enough data that disproves his assumption, if there wasn't any data that was useful enough to work with guess what, you just don't do it.
---
Honestly, I can't wrap my head around what's so hard to understand about this. If the foundation of your work is simply not right the rest crumbles.
---
It wouldn't change anything for me to do the maths with different numbers either because I'm doubting the conclusion regardless of the outcome. Even with his overblown latency data he still came to a result that is literally "so what?". It doesn't add anything meaningful to the spellbatching debate as it doesn't introduce new insights. His results aren't even radical enough to make an impact.
---
Add to this that, as I said before, people are misunderstanding the issue anyway.
---
Spellbatching needs finetuning. This is where the discussion has ended since day one but still we're here, huh?
---
Finally, you don't think I can take what you're saying seriously when you've been putting people down in this thread from the start. Really, all I can say is that your reaction to the criticism this guy received is what invites responses like mine, not the other way around.
---
It's 2019, chinese gold farmers are cheaper than making bots. If you are worried about RMT/economic impact those groups will do much more harm than bots.
---
Lol I have a "Horde pillow" I made in third grade. Also a custom made casing made of wood for world of warcraft with my characters name on it (which wasn't sized probably so nothing fit).
---
MEXICANS!
---
There was gold farming in vanilla, and it surely will happen in classic.
---
bots....yeah, maybe. in diablo 2-3 its very common.
---
its all on blizzard to instaban them, before the botting revenue is higher than the subscription costs
---
Anyone know where this guy gets his crystal balls?
---
Not only RMT but gameplay impact, especially in PvP. Bots can detect the best time to use specific abilities, breaking CC, cleansing, interrupting etc.
---
I think he's Dutch. Then it makes sense.. nachtelf. Still weird though
---
&gt; Old Av was a popular part of vanilla, what are you talking about?
---
No it wasn't. That is the explicit reason on why they kept changing it back in the day. That is why they remove so much of the side objectives and streamlined it. Blizzard has the data that shows that 1.12 version was more popular than they 1.5 version. The vast majority didn't want those days long games when they wanted rep and honor. It made getting AV games hard and they were normally limited to only a couple which were the exceeding long ones. 
---
I have fond memories of old AV but to say that it was popular is not correct.
---
Probably at cataclysm. And if not then, then definitely at mop.
---
You are arguing with yourself, at no point have i said that you should be able to walk over traps without triggering, quite the opposite actually.
---
I was making a note that historically, traps were one of the most aggressively "batched" spells in the game, outside of the "arming delay"/"animation delay" they should be pretty much impossible to dodge without resisting them.
---
to summarize my position:
---
1. traps and other sensitive spells like blizzard aoe should be put on a seperate and more aggressive spell que batch and/or moving forward should be more aggressively updated to the server similarly to how it is when you turn or strafe.
---
2. scatter/trap dr should be removed since its basically a result of a cherry picked patch where both prior to and post 1.12 it was working as most people expect and remember (being that they do not share DR with eachother).
---
Melee mages unite! Unfortunately you won't get any hit on your melee attacks - probably the least of your worries at this stage.
---
Here we have another person who has never seen WoW RP in their life
---
I will admit sometimes thaaat can be true but with the growth of rp on twitch and roll20 etc i do hope we see more rpers like myself that would prefer open rp to closed rp though i understand the need for both.
---
thank you fpr your comment, we can talk more about it after i get off work

For some of us in the rp-pvp community its the idea of fluidity to choose to attack, assist or leave a player of the other faction to their own devices.
---
That option is king to us and lets us more deeply rp aa character and if we do aid someone we must take mind what we use
---
Awesome. If I’m with a party and I spot low levels or solo members of the opposite faction I hope my party members will help me buff the shit out of him, then /wave and let him get on with his questing.
---
You should do one where a level 28 warrior gets crit for 275 damage.
---
I'm planning on making a more advanced UI with some more info, class filters would be a nice touch for sure, I'll keep that in mind once I get around to building that.  
---
Coloring class names I'm gonna put at the top of my list, that sounds like a nice touch and easy enough to do :D
---
I assume the +10 comes from the skinning dagger from finkle.
---
I'll see what prices will be for it on AH but if its this rare to drop i would not have any issues it goes to the skinner with the required 310 skill.
---
I did it for years in elite dangerous and that didnt have rp addons. I would rp in combat against non rpers all the time made for some fun memories because arguably in elite they can always be  character.
---
ye, I hope most people will enjoy their leveling time (not planning to "race" myself), but it's always fun / amazing to see how quick the people who do like to race to 60 are going :D

Anxiety: The Addon
---
No? Arena forced PvP into a confined space, highlighting every aspect of it. Classes who could CC too much had to change as they dominated. Burst damage now required a defensive CD as you can't run away. Everyone now has to have a spell lock or they can't beat healers. Everyone needs a snare, an instant cast, etc. 
---
Bg PvP became ridiculous as classes now balanced for sandpit fighting became massively OP in larger less co-ordinated fights. During WoD as a Destro Lock I could easily fight multiple opponents due the insane healing and damage because it was 'balanced', around teams who would interupt me. I have short video online of me one shoting 5 people in a single fight. 2 with one spell! (Gross overuse of CDs ofc).
---
If they never balanced around PvP they wouldn't have split the two trees
---
38 and looking forward to coming back. I have to say though I would have loved a WoW Classic HD version with updated textures, lighting and models.

Probably after they installed windows on it.
---
i vaguely remember it being a couple hundred gold. I don't remember if the skinner took it or if there was a roll -- I never saw one drop, I don't think.
---
Not at all. Levelled rogues to 60 twice and had about the same play time as the mid tier classes. You prob didn’t use the right spec/good enough weapons.

It was all APES, no asmon spergs were ganking
---
I didn't get that impression from the post -- they were talking about finishing up with internal testing? But his guess is better than mine.
---
You can't just nerf the item levels of stuff in AQ and Naxx.
---
Better for the newer raids to add new Spells or spell ranks, new Mounts, access to Silvermoon / Blood Elves, permanent stat upgrades, perks like mount equipment or other non-power related stuff.
---
At the end of the day, people raid for the gear though. So you'll always have to put better gear in harder raids no matter how many alternative progression paths you try to come up with
---
Where/how would you start that quest again?
---
Hmm I'm playing tbc at the minute and i just dunno if vanilla will be good for me then.
---
that's the point, yes. it becomes something you can control with levels and gear. it also allows leveling to be a "i can do this quest i just need to RNG the shit out of it" and that can make mediocre quests a lot more exciting and allow for choices to be made in combat beyond a standard dps rotation, 'i need to kite out maybe gouge and get a couple bandage ticks off.
---
Not going to play on RP-PvP but signed since it can't hurt to do that. Hope all the best for you RP-PvP people.

Levels 1-3 demotes faster but at loyalty level 6 it takes a bit longer for it to demote.

But yes you can still demote at lvl 6.

In short there is a armor/fire resistance mini set that may be partially used by feral bear as well as crit/dodge set for feral/rogue until devilsaur. Plus an-almost 60 healing set. With DM few purples but nothing groud breaking. Elemental has it value early on in the lifespan of a realm but then looses value, more so than tribal.
---
It often is enough if you’re following a good route and fighting mobs 2 levels lower than you. Obviously also spam potions and eat when you need to, but shouldn’t be that often. 
---
And yes I’ve played a lot of rogue
---
&gt;everyone will wanna roll on a streamer realm
---
lol nope.
---
Hey, I know nothing about RP realms but this sounds good. Are there any specific rules concerning the gameplay itself (ie : no running in town) or even about the character you play ? Who sets the rules ? Do you have any example of what a good RP-PvP would look like ?
---
&gt; "not that far from mage actually."
---
I respect the fact that you like leveling rogues as we both love rogues, but this comment really shows your lack of awareness of how big a difference leveling a Rogue vs some other classes are if you think they're in the same league as a Mage. How have you not seen mages AOE grind?
---
My 1-10 record is like 2 hours on rogue
---
You sure told him.
---
Can you give me one single explanation on why you genuinely believe that there won't be griefers on RP-PVP servers? As blizzard is not enforcing anything they used to on these servers, there won't be any guarantee that kids who you are so afraid of won't roll on your realm, nor that the so called super mature (right, playing video games at 30+ just as a second job) RP players won't be trolling you. Not trying to go into that debate, but i think we all have a child inside us, if this is our hobby. Sometimes mature ppl act just as childish as any kid. Don't you have anyone in your family that you don't like to play any board/cardgame with coz they just can't lose, even though they are father of 3 kids who all got their university degree already and has a very high responsibility job, it still doesn't mean they can't act like morons.
---
As any other smaller language based communities you can get together with your group and choose a server unofficially and RP there. Trust me, there won't be any difference. If someone plays WoW and their friend joins the game, they'll obviously play on the same realm as their friend, even though they might not even have a clue on what RP-PVP means when they launch the game. Also there's a possibility, they won't even give a single flying fuck about RPing, but still they'll want to play on the same server as their friend. With no rules enforced that RP-PVP server is going to be very similar to any other PVP server.  
---
Don't take me wrong, i'm not against your wish, i just think it's delusional to believe that RP-PVP servers are going to be so drastically different in present's WoW.  
---
Reality hurts, so i'm prepared to the mad downvotes. Lets get to it.

The quest starts with the Eye of Divinity, a epic drop from Domo's chest in MC.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18646/the-eye-of-divinity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18646/the-eye-of-divinity) 
---
You also need an Eye of Shadow (Drop from Kazzak and the elite demons south of Wintersrping)
---
and then you need to do the quest in strat's entrance.
---
I didn’t say rogue was as good as mage. Just not as far as you’re making it sound. Mage aoe grind only works on underpopulated servers and in certain areas. 
---
I mean there’s a reason why speedrunners use hunter and not mage.
---
also known as PW:F, as he wrote
---
Dishonourable kills are a double edged sword and im pretty glad they wont exist for the first month or two as it kills any type of group/zerg pvp as they give you a really big knockback on your ranking which makes it hard for anyone taking ranking seriously to group to take town or cities. 
---
Your guild is raiding org for the shits and gigs? Oh sorry i cant go because ill lose my ranking for the week. People calling for help at southshore to take tarren mill? Nah cant mate gotta stay in my premade and 5 cap AB for 14 hours a day.
---
Yeah that's tough. It takes the complexity of the add-on to another level. I, personally, think that just showing your faction's top people is fine.
---
Yeah there are downsides but I think the positive outweighs it. Great example of how nice it is for my playstyle. In Rfk yesterday I would swap over to bear if the tank pulled too much and have the rage necessary to charge a cast or hit something hard. I could then swap out and heal when the healer was oom, and swap back into cat and get an attack off instantly. I saved us from multiple wipes. Healer kept thanking me. That's what druids about baby!!
---
naxx in the new version would be 80
---
Technically you can, but it's much easier as holy or disc and even more easy with a custom hybrid build.
---
Alliance is cool but I had 2 60 alliance in classic and 2 60 alliance again on a pserver, time to go horde!
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who does this.
---
Yup, [if you look at the mount](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18247/black-war-kodo), it says "Requires Kodo Riding (1)"
---
Red is dead scum!
---
I subbed for one month and got in a week later.
---
Pretty sure both hunter and lock are faster.
---
Warlocks are extremely threat sensitive and Horde have no Blessing of Salvation. They only have Tranquil Air totem which gives less threat reduction and is only group based, so one shaman can only buff 4 people with it. Melee really wants windfury and will most likely get prio on the shamans so you have to have like 5-6 shamans to reliably get Tranquil Air, and even then the actual threat reduction is less than Blessing of Salvation.
---
So, starting a priest, on launch day, you gotta need that Wand.
---
The first wand you can obtain is 
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11287/lesser-magic-wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11287/lesser-magic-wand) 
---
The second wand you can obtain is his big brother
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288/greater-magic-wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288/greater-magic-wand) 
---
What is your approach to getting that level 5 and level 13 crafting wands?
---
My approach is simple. Get to level 6 in tirisfal glades (Undead Priest) and farm the scarlet south of brill until you get 60 linen cloth. 
---
Craft as many greens as you can with those 60 linen cloth, dissenchant them, craft your wand.
---
What do you guys think? Any other ideas?
---
Go for it, bugs get fixed (they already fixed several really bad ones).
---
People just panic, understandably , but really unreasonably.
---
Just means you will be even rarer and get *even* more gear. Which considering how fast hunters gear anyway is insane lol
---
Lol. No they won't.
---
But you need to get hit in order for 2% dodge to have a chance.. and doesnt lightning shield do about the same damage per mana point as a lightning bolt? If your earthbind kiting the cooldown is irrelevant because it'll proc everytime you run in to switch directions?
---
If you added a class tab I would 200% more interested. A warrior is not going to beat a hunter, but I'd love to see where I stand amongst others of my class.
---
What makes you the king of deciding what is "fun" for other people? Some people enjoy speed running Super Mario 3 as well.
---
 I can't see how it would destroy any "community" that some people want to rush it.
---
Wait.. things seem to be getting really political now lol
---
Yeah I guess it’ll depend on how layering will work. I don’t think dynamic respawn will be a thing, right?
---
Welcome to classic - where spergs of any variety are free to interrupt organised stuff.
---
I would like to recommend syncing with other addon users before running a /who to reduce load on the server's database.  Though you've restricted it to once per minute, with thousands of players running /who queries per minute during the launch day when servers are already taxed, we might see some bizarre load issues.
---
Though private servers are different core games, their /who databases can be fragile when overtaxed.
---
The bugs aren't that bad now in beta. The warlock pet bugs are....far worse. My hunter is 38 in beta, and I haven't noticed much in the way of bugs
---
Detection works different now than in the early days of WoW, it is much harder to bot undetected. Even if one went by undetected from those counter-measures, people are also more aware of them than back in tve days, and reporting is as easy as right click report. I’d expect retail level of detection, though initially Blizzard might monitor bots to see if anything new is on horizon and queue up ban waves when confident they know their for. If bots really screw up the player experience I’d guess they go with a more aggressive stance.
---
It takes time to level, even longer as a bot, scammed accounts or hand farming will be how the goldsellers get their stuff this time around.
---
The downsides of hunters ae the bugs the class has been facing since the start.
---
I quit the game during cata, before 4.2 went out because the class was so broken in PvP I was always angry. Pet dying when you invoke them, pet being stuck in arena, disengage bugs, traps bugs, unable to cast CC reliably (since spell pen doesn't work with traps) lag issues, pet behavior...
---
But the class is sooooo good to play in PvP when you master it.
---
I wouldn't recommend to play it from the start, though. I was a good hunter back then because I played rogue, feral, warrior and paladin  during vanilla-BC before finally turning to hunter at LK after leveling a DK to try, and it made me able to counter very easily any melee class.
---
How much of a difference at 60?
---
I’m definitely rolling a mage so this will make BB trips very fun..
---
This is the quirky shit that makes me love classic
---
That does not change the fact that cheating would imply that definend rules are broken, that is not happening, maybe goid sportmenschip and fairness rules are broken, like if a football player would add some extra legs to run fast and kick beter, he would have an edge on the rest but aslong as the football rules dont state u van only have 2 legs maximum, it would be allowed. So im not morally defending multiboxing but as i told many other ingame and out, report me if u think its cheating en nothing has happend.

Literal corpse camping
---
Vanilla hunters are bad for raids or end game content, the itemization is really bad and they suck, even in naxx and aq level gear.
---
They are good to level and do 5 man dungeons and PvP, other then that don't bother.
---
I miss Nost too, to rub it in I was one of the ones to get mistakenly banned a couple of weeks before the server shut down! They revoked the ban 2 days before!
---
Vanish removes hunters mark
---
No, but the other 2 will.
---
Shadow. You can still heal leveling dungeons, just drop the form.
---
Really hope they fix this before launch.
---
It would be nice, but I doubt it. Probably alot of people would moan if they did
---
Exactly this. Hunters (especially nelfs due to shadowmeld) are godlike in BG's and duels if played/geared properly. They're doing a pretty good job in early raids too but I decided to reroll around the AQ40 period since pve rotations became boring and I wanted a more challenging class (in both pve and pvp).
---
Should this one rppvp realm be in North or south America, English, Spanish or Portuguese, Oceanic, Europe, German, French, Russian or Asian?
---
Alright I thought you meant that you were gonna fear him after mc or something haha.
---
but this time he says its his "Final" one........ yeah.... I don't believe him either.
---
exactly
---
I've read that the popular warlock build is SM/Ruin (30/0/21).   
---
But what about going DM/Ruin (0/30/21) with imp for 20% threat reduction?
---
ye, somebody else suggested this as well and it kinda makes sense considering the huge differences between classes.  
---
it would 10 fold the amount of data that needs to be synced though if I want to collect a top 50 per class...  
---
hmm, maybe a good start could be to have the general leaderboard and a "your class" leaderboard, at least then it's only 2x and not 10x :P
---
Grats?
---
Its a joke tho
---
It really sucks, the old font was so much more impactful.
---
Dear mister I’m-too-good-to-send-an-invite-to-my-fans,
---
This will be the last package i’ll ever send your ass
---
It’s been two months since the release
---
I don’t deserve it?
---
I know you got my last two applications, i wrote the email adresses on them perfect
---
As an undead, the healing return on damage done is very high
---
Theyre safe but dont, you'll just feel like shit. If you want efficient healthier energy drink black coffee. Energy drinks just make you crash hard after a few hours, as well as being really bad for you.
---
Asmongold is going to abuse the sht out of this system... hes gonns have his chat ban ppl left and right, mock my words..
---
Your guild master will take solice in the fact that he knows he has at least one man that he can truly.... depend upon.
---
This. Look into Shadow PC. It’s a subscription to a dedicated VPS with its own desktop and stuff. You get 1000 up/down and almost no latency if your net is good. You might notice the colours be a little bit washed which is expected but shouldn’t mess your experience at all. Especially with Classic.
---
Isn't RP for people with disorders though? I've seen all kinds if things but we are ALREADY pretending to be heroes. RP servers alund like something over the top. Like, people would actually speak to me as if they are dwarves for example? It just sounds like a lot of crazies in one place. I get it weird fetishes and all, but the people playing classic will most likely be late 20s AT LEAST. Doesn't it seem concerning when people take make believe so seriously at that age? It sounds like a mental asylum almost.
---
Trade linen for a wand with whoever's making them or just play to 13-15 without, it's really not quite that important before that.
---
I’d jump at WoD again.
---
Escape from Tarkov - peng peng peng
---
Because during Classic RpPvP have been released only 1 year into the game, so of course they have lower player numbers and after Vanilla Open world mattered less and less so it doesn't matter if you're choosing Rp or RpPvP.
---
Retail numbers can't be applied to Classic WoW. The closest thing we have to gauge interest in Classic is different polls and every single one of them shows that RpPvP is more popular than regular Rp. In general PvP is way more popular than PvE, that goes for both regular servers and Rp servers.
---
Come on Blizzard. Pull your finger out and don't be stubborn. As a company you have been outstanding with regards to addressing Classic concerns and giving the community what they want - why is this any different? Please reconsider!
---
I played on RP-PVP servers back in the day and the only rule enforcing by blizz I ever noticed was forced name changes. Not once did I see blizz interfere with people trolling in /s, but to add to that I can count on 1 hand the number of times I witnessed people doing that anyway, It really wasn't a big deal.
---
That's all I want/expect from RP-PVP servers this time around also. The name policy is more than enough, the community can and will take care of the rest. 
---
The RP-PVP realm tag is important as it attracts a mostly different crowd than a standard PVP realm, which is what makes it so great. Picking a PVP server and making it the unofficial RP-PVP server, while better than nothing, just wont cut it.
---
Even nasa couldn't run the tarrenmill vs southshore battles.
---
Tailoring is underwhelming for Warlocks except for Bloodvine. Mages have Archmage, and Priests have Truefaith, but Robes of the Void is absolute **garbage** considering the cost.
---
[Robe of Winter Night](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14136) and [Felcloth Gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18407) are BOE.
---
IMO it's ridiculous killing your entire economy with a useless profession just to get a pre-tier set bonus in a later patch.
---
Going Herbalism/Alchemy while levelling to make gold, saving mats, and switching at 60 to another crafting profession is my advice. That way you can powerlevel Tailoring to 300 in a day when ZG releases, and make gold in the meantime - and you'll have Mooncloth, Arcanite and the option to buy herbs and make potions to make gold when you're finished.
---
Otherwise, Engineering is must-have if you're going to PVP, and Enchanting is a real money maker if you're in a good raiding guild and can acquire recipes early on. And Enchanting (unlike Tailoring) only becomes better in later phases when AQ recipes are added.
---
MD/Ruin is primarily used for the Felhunter resistance buff when tanking Twin Emperors, that's how I first tried the build and it quickly became my favourite spec because of how much you can tailor your playstyle with the demons. As you say, using imps for the threat reduction means you can usually unload and be relatively safe. Unfortunately you miss out on the 15% shadow damage buff from DSing a succubus, so your damage is much lower (15% extra damage compounds very well with improved shadowbolt, curse of shadows and ruin). What I used to do is DS the succubus on safe fights where generally the tank threat is very good or threat is just not an issue at all. On fights where threat is a bit fiddly I would start with the imp until the tank has a good lead, then  use the Fel Domination cooldown to instantly swap to a succubus. Some fights like Broodlord Lashlayer I would just use the imp throughout the entire fight. 
---
MD/Ruin also works pretty well in PvP. 
---
The obvious disadvantage is that you miss out on Improved Lifetap which causes you to waste more global cooldowns on mana recovery, but this affects relatively few bosses since usually you can either dps down the boss before you run out of mana with a pot or rune, or there are windows where you can't dps like when hiding on Firemaw so you just tap away anyways. Improved Corruption is nice to have, but usually corruption slots are given to SM/Ruin locks so it's mostly a PvP talent. If you want to use it in raids it only actually means your corruptions take 0,5 seconds longer to cast since the global cooldown is 1,5 seconds. You just have to stay still so multidotting while being on the move is hard.
---
So basically spell batching without the server latency is kind of (totally) broken.
---
Cool, I think those ideas would help a lot to make the addon less data hungry and even faster.
---
If you did your syncing via a hidden channel you could build something to verify results over several updates via consensus.  It depends on how worried you are about people messing with the rankings (which would be a byproduct of the addon popularity).
---
Pretty fun idea though, and the framework could be re-used for a Dungeon Race, Tier 0 Race, etc.
---
I remember waking up very early on at EU Release and walking to my local Store to buy it. I remember how fucking tired I was and then I remember having like 20.000ping and everything being nearly unplayable.
---
Some of us like to bug hunt, to help make sure that the Classic experience is fantastic for everyone else.  I know I reported dozens of bugs that hopefully others don't have to deal with.
---
They said they are considering RpPvP on the Warcraft summit in Mai.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_4YwvfEls4&amp;t=708s
---
@6:49
---
That  was about two months after they first said that there won't be RpPvP servers, basically making that statement obsolete for now.
---
Get your Red Bulls and shitter buckets ready people.
---
98
---
Yeah okay, maybe 3-4 tournies in a year vs. all the time they spend in a premade on the way to R14. You're not wrong but the stomping is still 99.9% of the PvP they will be doing simply because of how much PvP it takes to rank.
---
Starting a big tournament could be a good way to rank up a bit faster if you can get all the other PvPers to waste time in the tournament while you're stomping away in the BGs raking in the honor.
---
Now it's too late, I'm on a private server now, it's shit
---
And all I wanted was a lousy e-mail or a call
---
I hope you know I ripped all of my posters off the wall
---
I love you Blizz, we coulda played together, think about it
---
You ruined it now, I hope you can't test and you dream about it
---
And when you find bugs I hope you can't fix and you scream about it
---
I hope your ignorance eats at you and you can't release without me
---
The only good I see with an open beta that runs for over a month, is to let the people that will quit after two weeks quit in beta, and not being the live game.
---
I'm sure there's a few programs, but nothing like HonorBuddy or WoWGlider. Those were huge back in the day.
---
Professions can be tricky for a lock who wants to raid.  Every raider should have engineering. Warlocks need tailoring after zg is released for the bloodline set bonus.  This is why I always had an alt for herbing raid consumes.
---
I'm not counting the people who play 2 hours a week and will be level 45 when naxx comes out. But if you're 60 and in a guild, you will 100% clear naxx.
---
Eh I would give it time theyvgenerally announce a higher cap close to test date. If they don’t in the announcement prior to it sure. Just cause they didn’t in this last announcement means nothing.
---
Hunters do extremely well in world pvp, bgs and have quite a few favourable duel matchups. Pve early game is also very strong through ony,mc,bwl. People are correct when saying hunters start falling off around aq40/naxx but still bring usually 2 per raid for tranqs, pulling, and kiting certain bosses. 
---
When people say hunters fall off remember that’s only pve dps. Hunters are very strong in any form of pvp till the end. 
---
Hunters are also very skill reliant, it’s easy to be a okay hunter while sending your pet in and hitting buttons for damage. Very skilled hunters never clip their autos while kiting, weaving instant casts between shot timers, stance dancing between aspects, becoming a trap master, and micro managing your pet in all situations.
---
Tailoring has a four day cloth cd. Og wow I had a skinner/tailor. Swapped out skinning for engineering in aq to tank the twins (double shadow reflector).
---
PoE,osrs,r6siege,mordhau
---
everyone is over-reacting here, hunters are so much fun
---
People cleared naxx back in the day on 10fps while keyboard turning and clicking spells. I think the average normal mode raider will clear naxx the first reset.
---
Private server to get some raid experience before classic launches. I picked a high rate xp since I didn't want to waste time leveling, just to do it all over again.
---
If any of y'all are interested, you can hit 60 in 8-10 hours played, and my guild is starting Naxx progression now (2/15, AQ on farm) and need a few restos and holy priests, but will take just about anything if you're good and show up. We raid at 5:30pst, Wed/Fri/Sun.
---
Sugar is salty and water is dry.
---
I do the same plus all my ui is set to hide when not in combat, so I see the word as if I was in it
---
ye, syncing over chat channels is much lighter than /who querying
---
tbh I think if someone feels like going out of his way to write code to mess with the data on the chat channel then it's very hard to combat that, I added an config option to disable the syncing from the chat channel just in case though :P
---
Maybe you just need to stop being a pussy
---
Yes you can
---
oh dang did I miss a blue post? could you link it pls?
---
I plan to drink a ton of energy drinks, but i'm not going to skimp on what i eat, that will make me feel shitty as fuck, just meal prep and freeze a weeks worth of food.
---
Yeah, the game looks incredible. The world is really a treat. I couldn't stick it out with the way the combat feels though.
---
They are for min maxers and people who want to rush to endgame for whatever reason. Maybe it's they're 5th alt and they're done with the story. Maybe they need to level a priest for their raid.
---
But I agree, if it's for first couple of times and you use any leveling guide, (the ones that tell you to go here then here then here...a la Joanna's)  then you're depriving yourself of the magic of Classic.  But that's me though-- I think the best part of classic IS the leveling. So why would I try to hurry up?
---
Which private server?
---
I'd rather live in a country that has such laws - mandatory annual leave, statutory sick pay etc - than one that doesn't.
---
I fully expect like... 5 DPS more.
---
Wow
---
There was nothing stopping that in vanilla either. It constantly happened. Did you play vanilla?
---
If you run your wisp all the way down the coast to Westfall, you can actually fatigue kill your wisp in the deeper offshore waters there. Your wisp will still return to the previous spirit healer, but if you don’t rez, you can then run your wisp back again to your fatigued corpse and rez in those waters outside Westfall. It requires two trips, so it may or may not be the best option, but it does work.
---
Since you're saying you can just layer hop and you seem to expect to find Broken Tooth there as if there won't be any Hunters looking for him on those layers I think you're the one that doesn't have any idea how layering works.
---
Got Endless Legend on summer sale. Really good if you're into that sorta thing.
---
Yeah crip kiting worked in Vanilla but it won't work in Classic. You pro changers are really lucky.
---
https://youtu.be/5fZBwwC-ZaA is this it?

Dude doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  Complex bots are relatively easy to program once you get around being able to call protected functions.  You don’t need a trained neural network to evaluate your screen to react to situations.

Mechagon is neat. The other one... not so much.

Ah cool, don't remember it that well - just remember me cursing some dwarf the fuck out.  "GO AWAY!!!!!" Ah good ol' benediction, you served me well.
---
Preparing for Eternal Palace in BfA. Guild is looking a bit fragile, but our core raiders are pretty tight so we'll figure something out regardless of what happens.
---
Shifting cloak is really good, so elemental has it's place quite a few tanks will want to get the cloak because it is pretty good for feral, as well as for tanking against ony.
---
It's pretty evident that you are utterly clueless so there's no point in my farming you in duels.
---
Enjoying the summer, grilling, and relaxing in the pool
---
Any options just to add those you are friends with? :)
---
@snoxthefox Could you add a vector quality please?
---
Why would they care for a small font change to something worse?
---
yep, I'm talking about the bis lists. That's part of a build in my eyes.
---
For example, the prebis list completely ignores spelldmg and int, for weapons your choices are two super rare epic drops and the character has a libram, which is phase 5.
---
In the phase 6 build, we have healing boots for no reason and no 5/5 t2.5, which is simply better than going for grand crusader. Grand crusader items are a bit better individually, but the 5 set bonus from t2.5 is massive. Spelldmg is ignored again. Ring of the godslayer is just a wtf and blackhands breadth in an endgame build is also pretty weird.
---
Getting lost up shit creek without a paddle isn’t something that adults can normally afford to do. There are no built in indicators to hold you hand while leveling so progressing requires one of two things, time or experience. Time is something adults tend to not have, while experience can be outsourced from people who have played the game religiously for years. Learning the basics and familiarizing yourself with something you’re about to commit to is something any self respecting adult that understands the value of time does. Telling people to be irresponsible with this is borderline malicious because running out quests after zerging to level 20 via orange content might take someone a week to fix via pure grinding so you might as well start all over again with some directions. No surprise that this is where a huge portion of players quit.
---
It’s going to take experienced players 5-6 days of constant playing to reach max level. Are we really talking about a guide if you watch a 10min 1s long video where some mong who’s barely played the game regurgitates the same trash everyone else does? You know level 47 is around the halfway point right? What difference does saving minutes while you’re sub20 really going to make? What difference does killing 5 more monsters per hour (mathematically) really make by wearing spirit gear? Absolutely fucking nothing.
---
If you’re blindly following what someone else tells you to do even though you don’t want to and it takes a third party on reddit for you to realize that there’s an alternative then it’s time to close the browser and find psychological help. There’s plenty of time to get a few sessions of help before launch.
---
Weak heart bruh
---
&gt;The current client can use multiple cores.
---
Yeah, but most of the game is still running on one core, that's a big reason why performance in modern WoW is so shit.

The forsaken and some select orcs are warmongers. Trolls saved the world. Tauren are chill af. The orcs have a culture based around honor, but were corrupted as some important humans were. The forsaken were, well forsaken by the alliance. The alliance are boring, weak and weebish little fiends.
---
Heart attack waiting to happen. :D
---
Leeway only comes into effect when both players are RUNNING.
---
Hey I live in a country with similar laws, I'm not in a shithole where you can't take leave :D
---
But still, I'd be curious to see if that's ever enforced. Especially given job descriptions are nearly always generic and never reflect actual roles.
---
Same here! Will roll a gnome lock on a pvp server. I am totally new to WoW and will be playing casually (10-15h a week)
---
What profession would be best for my situation? At first I thought herbalism + alch for self-suffiency because I will play PvP and will get wrecked often due to lack of experience.
---
But I have seen 'robe of the void' and the bloodvine set been mentioned often in other threads and here as well. Am I better off picking tailoring with herbalism for money/later switch to alch or is it not worth it in my situation? ( Maybe the BV set / RotV takes too long to obtain for my playtime)
---
Btw, sorry for dumping my question here. Hope that it is fine with OP :)
---
The DR and leeway isn't huge I think, might even get fixed so don't worry about it.
---
Hunter is a fun, nuanced class with few limitations, both in PvP and PvE. Try to settle early in a guild and become one of the "main" 3-4 hunters and you'll never sit out a raid.
---
Played hunter up until my guild had BWL on farm on nostalrius and I still miss it.
---
To be fair though you guys do have the Dwarf race so that alone pretty much evens it out.
---
[Maybe you're talking about this?](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit#riding)
---
&gt; The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.
---
And that name tag alone would make sure the majority on the server are RP PvP players. They still enforce RP rules on RP servers for classic.
---
played a bit of pvp back in vanilla on my priest and yes you are correct in the fact that priests are pretty helpless when theyre on their own. 
---
An arms warrior will make you his bitch, a good geared rogue will too.
---
You just cant do much against those two classes so finding a group of ppl to pvp with is essential.
---
Against hunters it gets bit more even as you can mana drain them out (before they drain you) and their dmg drops significally.
---
Most other classes you start getting the benefit of dispelling their buffs spells etc.
---
I ran the most defensive disc build (imp inner fire, inspiration) and then it was tough to survive against some classes cuz you simply have no way of escaping their attacks like a druid has.
---
For shits and giggles i even used this: https://classicdb.ch/?item=19345
---
To make me as armored as possible but still just tough to survive as youre wearing cloth.
---
This is my pvp video from back then and in the beginning of the video you can see how close i am to dying to warrior+rogue gank but barely survive only thanks to my teammates healing me:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmgFNSrjfFQ
---
That said, its a fun class to play and you always are wanted because of your great heals,shields, buffs and dmg boost (power infusion)
---
Hope it helps
---
As Holy/Disc they're underpowered. In shadow they're very tanky with decent burst and are top tier in wpvp and duels. Less useful in BGs though and premades will insist you respec.
---
Jeah Frostmage rotation Bot would be a huge problem.
---
Also dont forget difficult wl rota!
---
Well, by definition, most people will go an average speed (average person is average) or even purposefully follow their friends, so number 1 generally won’t. 
---
We also don’t know how much layering there’ll be and if I’m not mistaken, it’s only gonna be there for phase 1.
---
Bro, do you have a vector quality of this image maybe?
---
Blood pact never gave him health. It gave him stamina that raises his cap but not his actual health. So it was just a container for more health, and if he somehow healed to full it would have made an impact. But he didn’t.
---
I've been slowly breaking her down for the last 6 months, she likes the idea of a druid because she gets to be a cat. The cat thing basically sealed the deal
---
I can somewhat agree with that. It's a good idea to do the analysis after the matchup, but it was still too long imo. In every streamer chat (even asmongold's) people were spamming to get to the duels already, and the participants themselves were complaining too. Doesn't this say enough? It's a level 40 tournament, there's only so much to talk about. Asmongold fanboys need to learn how to take constructive criticism. It was very predictable that my comment got downvotes. Not calling you one btw.
---
I understand your reason, and even agree that some stuff looks bad. But the point is that your great is a status symbol, a symbol of your charter's power, which can affect battle tactics in PvP, among other things. E.g. I avoided T3 warriors as a rogue, because there was no way I was doing anything to them before they killed me in what felt like 3 hits.
---
Thanks, I think the same. There’s actually been quite a few posts and discussion about it and some of the more informed redditors/players seem to prefer the second edition. It‘s the number of posts featuring the first edition that confused me a bit.
---
Depends on the spell. You would be best off looking up a downranking guide for priests.
---
Based on your spell power it also fluctuates.
---
Don't use a spell rank that you learn sub 20 is a decent general rule, they have penalties.
---
Yeah it felt a little clunky to me at first especially in pvp but it’s not like wow ya know? Don’t just spam spells. Gotta do light attack’s with buffs on, roll, stealth switch weps, stun with your arrows, switch back, cast ambush (like a shadow step) execute. Do some heavy attacks to get stam back up. Idk it’s different for sure. I think I like gw2s combat better. Best of both. But still it’s fun :)
---
I'd played mainly horde but had an alliance alt on an RP server.  I will probably do the same this time around.
---
There's only one viable chair and it's the [Raiding Chair](http://thenoobcomic.com/comic/408/).
---
I've said it before: Warriors are ridiculously overrated in Vanilla. Despite what PVP movies tell you, they're not some powerhouse - on the contrary they're easy to kite and vulnerable to CC.
---
In PVE they're top tier but not by a wide margin, and unless you like tanking, you're facing stiff competition for gear, and all your tier sets are tank-oriented. They're very fun to play though, that deserves mention.
---
Hunters on the other hand, are *underrated*. Best levelling class, best grinding class, guaranteed epics at 60, it's not until very late in the game you fall behind in damage, and in PVP they're strong and you can use PVE gear. On top of that it's a fun class with a high skill ceiling. Hunters dominate Warriors and Rogues, and are on par with Mages - and these are the three most common classes.
---
I can't speak for how bad the bugs are, but knowing this subreddit I doubt it'll be gamebreaking.
---
It's worth playing the opposite faction if you haven't if you enjoy lore. Myself, I played both so will most likely be playing alliance
---
this is the 200IQ plan  (that I was planning to do as well)
---
execpt I wont take tailoring, I will grab another gathering profession  and DE the  leatherworking  greens.  Since ill be doing a troll, leathers is easier to get in durotar compare to cloth in the undead zone.  play until level 8-9, mail everything to my alt. level my alt to 5 and craft. mail it back.  Trust me you dont want enchanting on your main on a fresh server.
---
Tailoring engineering
---
Dragons Dogma was a lot of fun but I put it down for reasons I can’t remember. Might get back into it soon, lots of fun.
---
But add it as part of a send pet and hunter's mark macro and it's totally a good idea.

I feel that sugar accelerates the caffeine absorption rate. Energy drinks contain so much sugar that I think the caffeine is rushed into your system pretty much instantly, giving you a huge boost but sudden drop off. Coffee seems to give of the caffeine at a slower rate, giving you a longer lasting buzz.
---
I vastly prefer coffee (or tea) to energy drinks. I like the taste of a decent espresso or lungi and it's much healthier than chugging down cans of liquid sugar.
---
Generally, I like certain rules: don't eat at the computer. If you have to eat, move your arse to a dining table and take your time. If you don't want to get up, don't eat. Don't eat junk food. Don't eat fatty snacks. Stay away from soft drinks and energy drinks, such with water and coffee/tea. Get up and stretch/walk a bit every couple of hours.
---
It’s out of print but that doesn’t mean you can’t find it - even if we exclude the pirate option mentioned above that I hadn’t been aware of. There’s like 10 posts on this very subreddit that include pictures of it and most importantly - you can borrow it from [Archive.org](https://Archive.org) for 14 days (when it’s your turn ofc).
---
You expect the 6 Tiers of "The Fate of the Kingdoms" to be packed inside a 3 ilvl delta?
---
Only one priest should have improved renew since casting a new one overwrite the old one and only that priest should be casting it.
---
Some fights require aoe healing and thus you spread the priest among the group taking damage (generally melee).
---
Main tank generally have a dedicated priest that will only heal him
---
Wotlk beginning of the end
---
Eh... you don't actually expect servers with INFINITE size, are you??? Because layers don't change anything with regard. If you decide to play on overpopulated server, your friend will have to wait in queue anyway.

Neuro plays classic? Another reason to love him

Truly a magical spec.
---
I like how they were very careful not to just say "this is the way leeway functioned in Vanilla". The only reason to word it this way is if they knew they changed how the mechanic worked.
---
Well, horde is superior. We're just reminding everyone.
---
Thing is they fall off in PvE but become nuclear weapons in PvP with the fucking insane HP and auto-damage in Naxx gear. 6500 HP and hitting like absolute railguns in melee too.
---
Yeah because horde were really honorable during tipsout’s tournament amirite
---
/cringe
---
That's why you take the boat to Theramore for a bit and then jump off
---
I've played only Horde except for the boosted Alliance I made to play with some friends but they didn't stick around in WoW so I went back to Horde due to simply having too much invested in it.  Now I'm just more familiar with the faction and wouldn't understand a thing about what to do on Alliance.
---
They are pretty worthless and the majority of people just threw them in the trash, so $2 is pretty fair.
---
Whats with the hostility?
---
Didn't realize the sentiment "Make sure you have fun", was so outrageous...
---
Read my post again, you'll notice it doesnt actually say "guides are bad" or "speedleveling is bad". 
---
All I wanted to communicate was for people to make sure not to get caught up in the race to 60 if they werent going to enjoy it.
---
That was due to the achievement system being implemented and part of the functionality was broadcasting to chat channels (like party) when people earned achievements.

So you believe that the name tag will be enough to have 100% rp players who never do anything wrong to anyone else. Okay my friend, time to end the debate i think.
---
i don't like this. nope. not at all. classic is going to be ruined in no time.
---
Im just hoping the server doesn't take a huge hit due to classic as id rather stay on there. 
---
Plus the whole layering business in classic and the monthly subscription is putting me off
---
Playing BFA, Destiny 2 &amp; working on my PS4 exclusives I just got.

Finished TLOU &amp; Uncharted 4. Still gotta finish Horizon Zero Dawn &amp; Spider-Man.
---
yes
---
I won't. I cant imagine there will be many more people than the last stress test.
---
&gt;They are pretty much top dps in terms of pre raid BiS.
---
They are not. They aren't irrelevant but they are still behind.
---
There’s not really any room to complain about the tournament...the hosts were wearing their boxers.
---
Also we dont know the real numbers yet. We just know, that the privat severs use wrong numbers. (Armor etc.)... They also let you stack armor pen abilities... thats not the right way, too.
---
I am sure, Hunters do not scale good and warris do way more damage, but how much more, we do not know until we have "real" logs.
---
If I recall correctly, agility used to increase wand damage on casters. This information is based on memory from 15 years ago, so I might very well be wrong.
---
I do, going for Warbear harness first but if i dont get to raid this breastplate would just be a long term goal i would work towards.

Shaman or druid
---
same.  pvp server are for 12yo kids like this guy.
---
I'm not arguing with them, I'm simply stating the weakness of an elemental shaman, and how to kill a shaman with a rogue, nothing more
---
For Twink lvl 40 it argues shaman wins. 
---
For end game it argues absolutely nothing.
---
That's it, I'm not going.
---
It was mostly Alliance messing with the fights. If they are in a horde zone Alliance cannot attack either faction that way.
---
Of course it helps my argument.  
---
My argument is "It's not an exploit".   
---
And I'd say that when a lead vanilla developer states in no uncertain terms that world buffs were meant to be used all at once then it's not an exploit, it's working as intended.  
---
Now, if your point is that they should be removed that's an entirely different matter.  
---
But it's not an exploit, under any definition of exploit.
---
Ok cool
---
WoW players negative?? Unpossible!

Just started Prison Architect. Game is pretty good. Before that I played Graveyard Keeper

holy shit what an absolute no life you gotta be !!!

Random stuns like mace spec have diminishing duration with other random stuns but not with direct stuns like intercept.

Purely because chain heal makes KT much easier.

Every other Naxx world first was Ally side, as well as basically all of AQ40. Horde got world first c'thun, but it doesn't really count because a boatload of guilds killed c'thun within a few hours of the nerf.
---
Man, I am all for Rp-Pvp, but me and my teen friend (we are both under 18) gonna role on Rp-PvP. We played alot on Rp-PvP, on the german "moonguard server" and man so many trolls, good fun and rages. In my expierince just a chaotic expierince but I could be wrong. Man german Rp-Pvp at launch brother!!
---
Would a dedicated renew healer prioritize stats different, as in the value of +healing might not be as beneficial for renew. Especially as overhealing with renew is probably far more common.
---
You have to go to Dire Maul in the quest chain, which is not at launch.
---

Honestly, now that classic is not hidden away on private servers and banned from twitch and is  very much in the public sphere 'Tipsout' has got  to be starting to regret his absurdly immature name. I doubt blizzard would engage with him at all or make reference to him soley because of it, unlike venruki, Ziqo etc who have been employed by blizzard in various roles (not that tips is comparable to those two icons)
---
So My husband is going to be going skinning and enchanting if I go alchemy. He will be making an alt for lw and skinning 😀 so I might not get the nice bop items but I’ll def get the devilsaur pieces eventually.  
---
I figure alchemy will be quicker gold with selling herbs too that I don’t need. So ty! I think I’m sold on alchemy ❤️
---
Yes you put it amazingly, it allows the extra stage of feeling your character much like some druids not fighting other druids etc.
---
World of Warcraft in Classic is a great era while it is a cold war era its not open war.
---
All i can say is if they are there give them a try if you want to. I help head a community called Pertento, so you could consider looking at our community or the other communities that make up the RP-PvP coalition.
---
Ganking will always be an issue sadly but that is mitigated by players of the same faction working together.
---
There's a difference between "only playing optimally" and "not taking a garbage spec".
---
&gt;ill play whatever the fuck I want
---
Have fun wiping in BWL for 2 months :)
---
&gt;More precisely it was really uncommon.
---
Everybody did it at one point or another. Nobody went through the pain of collecting world buffs for farm content. But hit a brick wall on a certain boss? Lack that little oomph? Stack world buffs and try. We did it on Nefarian, we did it with some Naxx bosses (we got there severely undergeared), it wasn't an habit, but I remember coordinating for Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer with other raiding guilds on the server.  
---
\&gt;  I would not mind if they addressed this in a 1.14 patch which might also include new vanilla style content (dungeon, zone, raid are all fine for me).   
---
I think this is a pipedream, the best thing for them, once people get tired of Classic is releasing Classic: TBC, and let the nostalgia roll.
---
Cata
---
I didn’t play them all but I did play a ton of beta.
---
I have most definitely ran a Vanilla WoW server on my chrome book just fine. The lap tops are shit though and eventually crap out on you. Maybe for a refurbished laptop in the $400 - $500 range.
---
Well hey, they turned that around in Cataclysm. Horde storylines in the revamped world were awesome and all of Alliance’s ones half finished. Westfall is burning in retail to this day.
---
Also, goblins got a second zone worth of quests in Azshara, where the worgen starting experience was half finished, and abruptly cut off and shipped them off to Darkshore.
---
;)
---
You have been playing with some God awful warriors if they are taking leather items in raids.
---
I put it down primarily to the return on holy fire being so efficient (and smite actually is better as far as DMG per mana at like 50% of levels) and just being able to take the extra DMG talents in holy.
---
The build I'm thinking kind of looks like the fresh 60 healing build in the sense of how many points in each tree, but with spirit tap, and damage focused choices not healing in holy tree.
---
I thought it might have been legit, but guess I'm going shadow wand. I've planned my wand prog anyway!
---
&gt;b-b-b-but class and other totems!
---
That a resto shaman can bring, without bogging down the raid with awful DPS.
---
There was Also that time that butler trolled asmon. Perfect.
---
Looool NE
---
None of those classes heal so they don't compete for the same gear.
---
No idea how much druids will compete for healing cloth. Probably a lot.
---
Wait, how many guilds do you think will be hard progressing? Do you think classic will be that small?
---
Ohh shit it's still Alive? Last Time i played Classic EQ was like 18 Years ago...
---
Group up with an enchanter in your guild. Will probably go faster. Or with others in your guild striving for the same.
---
Every class uses some of the same gear that other classes do. Shaman are the only class that use +int mail (except hunters in rare cases) and druids are the only ones that can really use +int leather. Besides those I would say prot warrior.
---
&gt;Working as intended*
---
The wording of that talent would very much imply it isn't working as intended. Test all you want. It's clearly an unintentional bug.
---
/shrug
---
It worked fine for me when I leveled a Shaman.
---
I love how your example has the rogue using literally every cooldown available to win the fight. If a rogue does this pretty much anyone is going to be dead. (Yes, I know rogues are very cooldown reliant)
---
Also, every class is going to have at least one class they are extremely vulnerable to. That’s how classic pvp works. 
---
It’s almost unanimously acknowledged that elemental shaman is extremely strong in pvp.
---
Here is a crazy idea. Don't do shit you could get reported for.
---
Omar*
---
Definitely ! Alliance is def the best faction ma dude by far OP
---
im actually asian
---
He seems pretty chill about it tho
---
Beta ends in a week anyway.
---
Cant wait to have loads of noobs thinking they will be awesome melee shamans stuck healing me at 60 &lt;3
---
Why is that?
---
Offcourse 1 to 60 is fun, it has alot of content and stuff isn't bad. But also alot of classes and stuff are weird/buggy/not overtought or underpowerd. I really like the class paladin, but I don't know if I should play paladin on Vanilla cause I don't like being a raid buffer+spam flash of light. 
---
Not only the paladin class was weird, druids, priest, hunter endgame were not that great though.
---
I think TBC is just a better Classic version of WoW, beside dailies and flying, I think the overal experience for people was amazing. Most classes got their stuff together, almost all classes and specs were viable to attent raids and pve stuff. Paladins weren't stuck in healing, druids could be balance, priest didn't became insta healers. 
---
Gear was alot better ( like statswise) 
---
PVP was not bad, Arena came out.
---
And TBH , maybe my experience, but I have raided classic on private servers with 40 man naxx, it was a fucking hell to get to 40 players.(and have 40 players attent a whole raid without people have to leave etc)  I think 25 man raids with some 10 man raids (kara), ( Zul Aman) +dungeons were very good. 
---
You Actually needed to perform some quest + doing reputation stuff in each zone to unlock heriocs.
---
Where exactly do they admit that?
---
My raid leader was yelling this on TeamSpeak. Where you playing on crushridge?
---
He didn't say that though.   He just said they were meant to stack, and it was a fuckup, because people began to abuse it.   EXPLOIT IT!
---
It's literally the same the thing except different zones. How would you not know what to do?
---
God of war. Going balls deep into it this time
---
Hunter damage is not at the level of Warrior or mage during tier 2.5/3 sure. However, the bridge between is not enormous as some individuals are insinuating. During Molten Core and Blackwing Lair you will be near the top for damage. Most classes have a mix match of gear in order to reach their respective statistical requirements.  Hunter will always be striving for a full 8/8 tier collection. Unlike a warrior who is gunning for one piece, like Band of Accuria. Hunters get geared very quickly and absolute crush damage for 65% of the expansion. Moreover, they are not relying (as much) on those niche single boss drop items. 
---
The Tier 2 final set bonus is also very significant and having a few hunters providing it can be extremely punishing for boss targets. Hunters do not have aggro issues (from damage) like mages or warriors. So, we also have near 100% uptime on damage unlike Mages where you need to stand still consistently for 7 second intervals and whenever you get a large critical strike. Parts of AQ and Naxx are impossible without hunters using Tranquilizing Shot and Nature Resistance.  Having 3-4 hunters in AQ-40 makes things like Princess Huhuran a lot easier. 
---
PvP should not need to be mentioned, Hunters are always strong in PvP for the duration of Classic World of Warcraft. Not to mention PvP in classic is mind numbingly easy. Oh! Thereis a mage, I wonder what the odds are that I will see a Frost Nova, Blink and FrostBolt?
---
I could literally hear the backing music as it read that out loud lol, the feels.
---
I wouldn’t worry about it. There’s a solid chance blizz works out the kinks before launch, and if they don’t there’s a high chance they continue to patch bugs in the months following launch. 1.12 is just the last version of classic produced. There’s no reason to believe blizzard wouldn’t continue to fix bugs and address balance issues.
---
Just about everything in vanilla wow was shit.
---
Depends what profs you're talking.  Gathering professions? Definitely.  
---
With the exception of First Aid, anything that uses resources that you could sell instead, is a bad move. Especially on a fresh server, every gold doesn't count... every *silver* counts. 
---
You need to be able to afford to learn skills. Buy the occasional vendor weapons/armor, increasing your dps, grinding speed, and survivability.  And that's why FA is an exception. Dying a lot means losing TONS of time. So you're better off using cloth to train, level, and use bandages. You can even use pretty high level bandages as a low level character. So a 4 second stun of a mob and /use Mageweave Bandage can fill your health completely before you take that next bash to the face.
---
Getting ahead of the curve, as much as possible, is way more important than being 300 blacksmithing when you ding 60.

Graphics are client side.

Wholesome content
---
If thats whst you think, dont play it.
---
Prot warriors based on the fact that there's only a couple of them per raid.
---
Shaman if played correctly is one of the best PvP classes at 60, especially in battlegrounds.
---
with a hybrid spec into elem/resto it deals insane damage and can also be extremly good as a healer. 
---
Every class and spec has their OP stuff

Do spriests have a hard time finding a spot in  premades?

because you said that as proof shamans are a great choice? i feel like im being baited here, how cant you understand this simple reply.

for dueling it's essential. Dispel Magic and Mana Burn are your two winners in pvp.

From [Wowhead's Interview with Brian Birmingham and Patrick Dawson](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit):
---
&gt;The modern riding system was introduced in one of the later 1.12 patches, and as we were discussing it, we felt this system was added to prepare the game for Burning Crusade, which had the ability to ride flying mounts.
---
&gt;For most of the history of WoW Classic, throughout 2004 and 2005, we had the older mount system. It just felt more authentic to that game, to use the older one instead of one that just laid the groundwork for another expansion.
---
That all depends on the quality of the bug lol
---
I recall seeing a steak icon for the food but I might be mistaken maybe it didn't restore mana... I'll have to check it out again 👍
---
Launch is launch...
---
If you respectively waited until it was over then you have plenty of honor. It's like the difference between ganking someone fighting 2 mobs and waiting for them to eat and drink before engaging.
---
Don't presume to know what others are thinking if they don't put it in words.
---
People who actually like, prog on normal raids likely won't clear naxx in the first reset simply because they won't be driven to do it. Sure the average normal mode raider COULD clear naxx in the first reset, but anyone who just raids normal and doesn't really push past it won't really have much drive or time to do naxx in the first reset. The likely reason they only raid normal is because they'd rather be playing new alts, levelling etc, doing pvp, collecting stuff, etc, or maybe they only raid one or two nights a week casually, family guild type stuff. These are the people we'll see playing rets and enhances and spriests, doing what they just think is the most fun for them at the time.
---
It can come from Finkles or the Zulian Slicer (but this is a ZG drop, so it won’t be in for many phases)
---
If the stuff that happened in the old Fax monkey stupid mage tricks isn’t replicable in PVE when kiting mobs then isn’t that not vanilla like? Right now we have mobs hitting from super far away In PVE
---
I don’t think any posts here have been made by beta players that have experienced playing with the leeway mechanic or shared dr on trap and scatter. If you have any interest in pvp or rolling a pvp server, these two points need to be considered as they are 2 potentially significant nerfs.
---
I’m 100% memeing. I want an authentic experience but this post is nitpicking
---
Memory sucks, you had real bad internet or both. There was a noticable delay on most slows from when they "landed" to when they took effect. Something we now refer to as spell batching. 
---
I don't think I even want it personally. Your just fucking wrong if you think it didn't work like this in vanilla.
---
explore and do quests that don't require competition.
---
In Coldridge Valley for example... Scalding Mornbrew Delivery and the followup Bring Back the Mug grant about 700 experience - in about 1 minute's worth of work, and its a quest chain that requires no kills, no competition, etc. Can be done with 0 people on the server, or 10,000.
---
Same with The Fargodeep Mine and The Jasperlode Mine in Elwynn. 1,320xp between the two of them for literally walking into a mine (that'll likely be empty come launch, with people killing all the mobs) - EZ PZ.
---
my Raid only cleared BWL before BC hit - so were werent even close to the theorycrafting min-maxer playstyle. Our raid had it all man, Offtank Druid, fury warrior, moonkin, all kind of shamans, TWO shadow priests. Those were the innocent times of raiding. Hitting 70 and starting the T5 raids changed a lot.

Oh wow it just downed on me that realm-wide Discord servers will probably ruin everything.

&gt; you do realize this would be more of an issue at 16:9 than 16:10?

You do realise they develop for a 16:9 aspect ratio? And everything else is an afterthought? So instead of coding in other aspect ratios they just zoom in.

Typing those words doesn't make them true.
---
&gt;Charge hopping works because the server only ever considers you in two places when jumping when determining if a spell is triggered on you.
---
&gt;for example, if you jump from position A to position B the server and a warrior charged you mid jump prior to the MOVE_FALL_LAND packet arriving and updating your absolute position then they will charge to position A even if you were 90% of the way through the jump.
---
Sure that's the nuance of it, but I'm talking more to your point from your other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c96duz/were_doomed_bois/eswo9w2/?context=3):
---
&gt;You can see this by warriors getting frozen by traps mid charge and if it was a possible to dodge it via a 400ms window it would have happened quite a bit but in reality the only way it would fail is if it resisted.
---
I was saying, the path the warrior takes is deteremened on cast, and if there's a trap on said path, it's triggered. This is why frost trap still effects warriors after they've left the area of effect until the next batch tick, after charging through it, or why freezing trap almost always seems to land when charged through (except for resists). It's not the same check made as a player freely running through said trap. I was just using charge hopping to reiterate the point that the path is determened before going off and not updated in real time is all. Nothing more.
---
&gt;here is an example from tbc with charge hopping:
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/iqqrO0iX11c?t=53
---
he doesn't charge to where the mage is, he charges to where the mage started the jump from.
---
Yeah, that's what I expect to happen as well. This isn't something we disagree on, but part of a finer point is all.
---
&gt;As for the batching, i was referring to your comment here:
---
&gt; &gt;Yes, it's to do with batching. Essentially (from what I understand of it) if you're able to clear the trigger range of Freezing trap within the batching period (400ms) the game will never acknowledge (server side) that you were in the radius of the trap for some reason, and thus will not trigger.
---
&gt; &gt;I've no idea if this is correct &amp; expected behaviour, or some weird quirk with how they've re-implemented spell batching back into the game.
---
&gt;My point was that vanilla wow had a 400ms tick rate and traps were still notoriously (impossible?) to dodge so clearly there was more going on here than just the 400ms batching rate. different priority batch ques? different frequency batch ques? i have no idea why or how its broken on beta but this is not what i was trying to say.
---
Sure, and if we all had internet connections from the era and server had the terrible server infrustructure from the era, I imagine this wouldn't be anywhere near as much a problem as it is nor incredibly easy to abuse as it is. But with the same thing as melee leeway, it's only a way more apparent issue because player pings are significantly lower and the overall performance of server hardware is monumentally higher than what we had 13 years ago and as an end result, it's made significantly more noticeable.
---
Eitherway, I'm interested to see if Blizzard will say anything on the matter and if they're going to fix it or not (I hope they do, I don't wanna play Hunter but it's one of their few *reliable* methods of control rather than getting deadzoned to death). I can imagine this becoming an incredibly vitriolic issue later down the line if it turns out its intended and there's a consistantly easy way to do it.
---
Good talk though, I got to go to work for now. Enjoy the rest of your day bud!
---
Boo you, whore.
---
Not really. A melee who can hit you because of leeway is already in your deadzone and there's nothing you can do to stop them from closing. This isn't something that is making or breaking the hunter pvp experience.
---
#NOCHANGES
---
That's cool.  I wonder if there's any kind of build that would use those items.
---
well, ive never counted on a mmo being good before, but i know this one will be just by looking at it
---
Ur mom
---
It is cheating... 50% raid dps and 30% health is cheating.
---
&gt; thriving on private servers 
---
It's not thriving.... There's a handful of servers still going, and a lot of those people won't play classic.   Much of the new traffic is because of classic too.   That's what will be left too if these cheats are allowed.  A handful of servers.
---
Did you know most people don't even go to AQ40 or naxx on these pirated servers?  They jump shit to another fresh server usually.
---
The fury warrior BIS pre-raid is largely leather. Stage 3/4 BIS I think uses a lot of leather too.
---
Not from personal experience but what I keep hearing is that in high level premade and stuff it will be difficult to get in as a spriest. The main problem that I hear over and over is that in coordinated pvp the enemy team will be dispelling and cleansing constantly which shuts down a shadow priest pretty hard.
---
Some people have made arguments for a spriest on defense but even that doesnt seem like a good plan cause they cant stop somebody if they can out run them like most flag runners will do. 
---
Unfortunately I think spriest is too niche at 1v1 fights to be useful in organized pvp. A warlock can do equal dmg and has a more reliable cc kit
---
if you wanna feel bad about yourself, that is
---
Italian has more native speakers in Europe than Spanish. Both definitely have more than Portuguese.
---
Will check it out. Looks like a lot of work went into it so good job and thanks.
---
Seems I was in very conservative guilds. We only had warrior tanks (me being one of them). No moonkins and no shadow priests because we always needed healers.
---
I would imagine important things people are recording on note paper would be, time when or since the player reached that level, their zone, and if they are offline the time offline.
---
Of course they will fix bugs that are clearly not like it used to be in Vanilla.. That you think otherwise is retarded
---
Lot of streamers got burnt out just trying to get to 30
---
The only two reasons I could imagine would be to discourage real players from interfering with your gold farming operations (not sure of cost/reward to this admittedly) or an honor buddy like program on steroids.
---
*gnomish blood
---
&gt; address balance issues
---
They've said they want everything just like in vanilla, so balance is out of the question lol.
---
But I do know one thing though,
---
Betas they come they go.

People are forgetting that the bloodvine set is BoE. 
---
If you want then just drop tailoring after getting Robe of the Void, and have a guild buddy craft it for you.
---
&gt; Of course they will fix bugs that are clearly not like it used to be in Vanilla
---
oh you can see the future! please id like the next lottery numbers.
---
Yeah eso is one of the best mmos with ... some how... the worst combat. I can’t
---
This is either a troll post or you have negative IQ, pick one.
---
You dont get a charge off vs a priest with 36y. Also they can spec stun resi.
---
One thing I learned back in highschool looking through my d2 manuals is they are completely useless because every value has changed at least 5 times since the book was written.
---
Why do rogue players always love coming up with these theoretical fights where they "own" everyone. 
---
That shaman in the tournament messed everybody up. Did he even lose a fight? People tried resetting the duels over and over and over. They kept coming back and getting womped. 
---
What should you take away from it? Shaman own at lvl 40 people. A bracket that doesn't exist in vanilla. It was artificially created on the beta.
---
/1 someone trade me bananas, my gorilla is pissed
---
Doesn't this petition kinda prove there is not enough players for rppvp in Classic?
---
And when people ask for only one rppvp realm I suppose they mean one NA server and screw the rest.
---
Cave Story+, Hollow Knight, Deponia, Hyper Light Drifter, Odd World: New 'n' Tasty.
---
Picked up Grim Dawn expansion on summer sale
---
I was getting 100fps+ on an i7 6700k and gtx 1080 with it at 4K windowed. I just purchased a 4-5 year old machine with an i5 3.5ghz and rx380 8gb card.its for my son I expect it to easily pull 1080p 100+FPS.
---
Hah thanks dude :)
---
So this is kind of a big ask, unless something like this is already out there. Is there a general "consensus" on how each class measures up against one another? Like we all know that mages beat warriors, so I'm looking for something similar where you can visualize the good and bad matchups. I ask this with the understanding that there is a lot of room for opinion, gear, spec, etc at play, especially in the late game. I am mostly just looking at "world pvp while leveling" to keep it simple.
---
I tried this out in mid-to-late TBC on my druid. I picked up the tanking mace from cenarion expedition, got a few more pieces with defense rating on it, and stacked some spell power. You could hold aggro reasonably well with moonfire spam, with melee swings to regen mana. It wasn't for anything more than running heroics with people that didn't severely outgear them (and thereby pulling aggro), but it sure as hell was fun.
---
No Oomkins allowed in my raids.
---
Shamans are powerful, I remember how I died to one around my level in Theramore, all he did was once chain and one bolt and it was exactly around level 40, however, as far as I know, they go OOM very very fast, that's why you don't see any in PvE. Chain costs like half of the mana bar.
---
Irk, one guy that bought it was hospitalized after he drank it.
---
The questlines are different so it is a completely different experience.  Not to mention I know more people who are Horde then Alliance personally.
---
Yes, completely possible back in the day...but you are fighting level 1 wolves...this happens for the first minute or 2 of the game? Not exactly something to even care about.
---
Dont try that with the bandits who are lvl 3. 2 is doable if you have max health at the start...if you get 3 of em, and you likely will, you are toast.
---
Once you leave the starting area, 2 mobs is your max (basically) until you are a geared 60.
---
I'm not strongly for or against RP-PvP realms, but the answer to your question is likely that you can still PvP on a PvE realm, but you can't avoid PvP on a PvP realm. If they are worried about RP population, then it's the smart choice. The only question is if they should be worried about the population or not.
---
By doing half the dmg of a mage.
---
Great that solves a lot of my questions actually. Thanks
---
www.vanillafriends.com
---
I don't really remember leveling.  I only know that dying was a possibility and I was thankful that you could leash mobs, run outside of their area and have them stop attacking, unlike in EQ where you had to zone.
---
The problem that a lot of people are having is that they recall leveling in a much earlier patch.  Leveling in 1.12 was a joke.  Leveling in BC was a joke.  Classic leveling will feel like a joke because of 1.12 numbers and because the entire community is experiencing an MMO with hindsight.  They know what to keep, what to craft, what quests to skip.  The discovery portion is absent so that makes the ease more apparent.  
---
I doubt they deliberately changed the values of last patch Vanilla to appease the people.  But they most certainly should have changed the numbers to make leveling, dungeons, and raids mathematically harder than they were by 1.12, even if they mechanically had never been difficult.
---
Druid solo, paladin in a group. Priest will get Viper Sting spammed and polymorphed into oblivion plus are squishy and easily focused down. Paladin can dispel everything a priest can plus poison and can endlessly spam flash of light heals, Freedom on warrior, BoP on locks and mages, Sac if you’re fast to avoid poly and if all else fails at least you have plate and a shield against melee trying to train you and invincibility for 12 seconds.
---
My little miff about this point is inconsistancy on the part of the team leaders of the game.  For example, they give scatter and freezing trap the state of the game in 1.12.1 final build.  BUT!!! They give mount riding and riding skill training the state of the game prior to 1.12.1 final build.  
---
TO me, this feels like they pick and chose what version of the game they want to go with.  They could pick any version of the game based on the fact they have a change tracker with all the changes to the code base since 1999.  So they know what changed, but they may not have the comments on why it changed (comment your code with details programmers.)  But, they decide to cherry pick different versions of the game to mix match systems, at least in the specific example between mount skill training and hunter CC duration reduction.
---
Out of curiosity, when you rerolled around AQ40 period, what class did you end up choosing?
---
No bugs only features
---
 I would advice to choose the faction you have played the least. Going to be a bit confusing with quests and npc locations etc but it's a completely new experience which should be a lot of fun.
---
 I have killed gnomes and elves in tbc, wotlk and a couple of private servers, know the quests on horde side like the back of my hand. Would be a waste to not take the chance and play Alliance this time so red haired gnome it is! Always liked their death animation at least lol.
---
Almost broke my controller on the first DS 1. Now days that game is rather relaxing to me. Then again, I think I have that game's layout memorized.
---
"Yeah"
---
Hardly butt hurt. Imagine being this butt hurt about someone seemingly not butt hurt but assuming they're butt hurt.
---
Warrior, mainly for pvp excitement but also for pve where I could either play for dps meters or offtank
---
this is me being og ally vs my friends who are set on horde
---
I came to the big city. Spent like 15 hours there watching boring conversations. Is it worth finishing? Got kind of tired just walking from place to place and pressing X to talk.
---
It might not be a critical issue (no pun intended), but I'm totally with you OP. The Vanilla font and number feeling just feels a lot better.
---
Does someone know if an existing addon can replicate Vanilla font?
---
I believe he was trying to say that its the only place you can experience all three aspects of the game together, RP/PvP/Pve
---
Why didnt you just google this?
---
I'll play both because why not.
---
This is only for the race to server first, not for speed levellers, right? I mean, someone could be fastest in hours /played but way behind the first to hit 60 because they choose to sleep, work etc.
---
You need peels, so solo is shit. At least group with a mage so you get peels, water, and a pretty nice buff.  You want to dispel buffs and hots offensively , drain mana, and heal and dispel defensively
---
You don’t need to swim all the way to Westfall though. If you hop up on land every time you have a chance you will find that at a point, while you are still along the Dun Morogh coast, the music will change to the Westfall theme. A short time later, still along the coast of Dun Morogh, you will see a dilapidated shack with a dock in the middle of nowhere along the Dun Morogh coast. If you fatigue/drown there you will rez at the Sentinel Hill graveyard.
---
The x-faction duel tourney started out inside of Caverns of Time. Alliance rogues were griefing horde contestants mid-fight by ambushing/cheap shotting them. Some of the alliance contestants received heals mid-fight as well. To remedy this, they moved the tourney to Echo Isles in Durotar, a horde friendly zone so the alliance couldn't attack the horde contestants unless the horde were flagged. 
---
That is essentially it.
---
Ok so you've just completely discredited yourself. I'm done as I've realized I'm debating with an idiot. Goodbye
---
Early lvl mobs on pservers are harder than they should be yes.
---
That doesnt answer my question. Why do you care if you arent affected by the meme specs, since they arent in your raid anyway.
---
As a spriest what are your best options for farming and gold generation?
---
It's a good job you are hear to tell other people how thay should play the game they are paying for..... /s
---
That will probably struggle a bit at anything higher than low settings. The newer one will run it perfectly at High/Ultra (outside of raids). 
---
I wouldn't buy a new MBP just for Classic. You are better off spending 1/4 the price and getting something 1/4 the price that will run it significantly better.
---
I believe its #1.
---
But how did you end up getting #2 result? 
---
110x4.6 = 460x1.1 = 506. 
---
#2 = #3
---
How on earth are you even old enough to be allowed on reddit? You fit the criteria for a pre-teen so disgustingly well
---
Blizzard kind of already confirmed that the beta will be over after the last stress test coming later in the month.
---
Its purely subjective. 
---
it may not be fun for you, but could be the greatest thing ever for someone else.
---
my bad was thinking PW:S for some reason
---
Owning is generally better than buying but it’s all situational. In a lot of cities across the USA the housing mkt is currently in the tank. It’s a great time to buy but a bad time to sell. I’ve heard of ppl selling their houses for half what they paid for. 
---
Renting gives you flexibility which can sometimes be very valuable. In a high growth mkt like Colorado yeah there’s opportunity there but it comes with major risks. Such is real estate. Also, some people want to pay off other forms of debt first, I.e. student loans, which is why so many millennial are renting. 
---
Don’t own unless you can afford it. We don’t need to get into another sub prime mortgage crisis.
---
If you make it to aq/naxx, you've probably got a pretty secure raid spot in your guild, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.
---
It's because the new mount system was made in preparation for TBC, it was easier to introduce flying mounts this way.
---
Found the elitist
---
It is true. Every guild, even casual guilds want to progress, many willa ccept meme specs at first but when the guild is stuck on a boss for weeks or months drama will happen. Its guaranteed. Even if they dont blame the meme specs, the players that play the meme specs, how will they feel? They know they are the main reason why progress is stagnant. I still say play what you want and i hope you gind a guild who wont ever care but thats not gonna happen ib 99% of guilds.
---
Torn between shaman and hunter. With hunter I feel I would enjoy pvp more but I’m looking to do lots of pve content such as dungeons and raids and feel shaman would be better / easier to find groups with (also melee groups with WF totem sounds so fun). I’d be going the 30/0/21 spec for shaman if I ran it so I could do decent damage in pvp. Decisions decisions
---
Curse of Recklessness
---
CLASSIC IS DEAD.
---
the power spike leveling is so insane for the lesser wand, only 10 skill needed and you get to level 2 from making the rod you need.  
---
You only really need to get to tailoring 30, which you can get there by crafting bolts, and if needed crafting the 1 bolt recipe in tailoring.  Then you craft the 5-8 green vests for 15-24 bolts, because you should get 3 or so skill disenchanting your greens or weapons for an essence.  
---
Getting to 70 isn't bad as enchanter, just make sure you have bracers on your character to recast that, and you will need 3 lesser essences per caster in your leveling group for the wand.
---
I care, because I too know the pain of losing my guild due to playing meme specs.  I just don't want others to go through the same pain as i did.  This was even in TBC, when enhancement shaman was more than viable.  Hell, one fight I was 2nd on damage and healing.  It was never good enough though.  Everyone expected the shaman class lead, and Officer tasked with coordinating the healers to keep healing.
---
OT paladin up to AQ40 here.  We had all the meme specs.

---
Well, hunters won't be TOO far behind in MC but yeah they're at best going to be middle of the pack and fall off pretty quickly. 
---
Dps isn't everything, though, but you should know that guilds tend to bring a limited number of hunters because their main utility is tranq shot and you only need 3-4 at most. Most stacked class will be warrior by a long shot, expect at least 10 per raid.
---
Ya this. We don't need threads. We have a database.

The guild I raided with in Vanilla.

Sadly #nochanges is dead.  As Classic has gained popularity, people with no real understanding of the ramifications of changes or care about game quality have flooded in.  Just look at how many people think layering is OK.  A year ago, even people who were pro-changes on this sub would have scoffed at such an idea, for the most part, but now it seems a large group of people actually support it because it's a QUALITY OF LIFE "improvement", which people forget or don't care thst is how retail got so awful- QoL "improvements".
---
It's like people forget this is the same Blizzard that screwed up WoW to begin with and thought people wanting Classic were idiots.  They assume the game is going to fail (adding layering because they figure population will drop significantly) but its a self-fulfilling prophecy, because stuff like layering makes the game shittier, so the game *is* more likely to fail.
---
Even with these issues (and arguably at least 2 of the main ones are clearly bugs that will be fixed) hunters are still op as fuck &lt;60 in classic.
---
"And now my disc priest is tied up in the trunk"
---
That’s pretty smart, but way too much effort. 
---
I just wanna help people 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
 Yup, let people play whatever they want. It's not the early days of vanilla, the info about hybrids from a min max viability perspective is impossible to not run into if you do some googling. If someone decides they want to only play as a moonkin spec for example, they think it's awesome, of course they should go for it. If they get into a raiding guild and get geared I'm sure it will be a cool experience. 
---
 Yes most probably a lot of players in serious guilds will not accept it but I would imagine that a moonkin wouldn't be invited to such a guild anyways so it's not an issue. 
---
If you are unhappy with "meme specs" in your guild, then just quit the guild and look for a guild that is better suited for you.
---
Okay this is specism.
---
I’m creating an accepting guild free of these specist h9ters.

---
Proper and complete playtrough of Divinity Original Sin 1&amp;2 should take about 2 months (assuming you have a job and some social life). Just enough time to finish it and start to play classic when it comes out.
---
yeah, i think its the stroke.
---
Which would be even worse for them and for Blizz because if they ever wanted to come back, those characters are gone forever from the beta being wiped
---
All the fortnite players on alliance.
---
How is it better for pvp? Shoreter queue times? Generally better organization and higher win rate? Certainly not in combat itself as horde racials are superior.
---
Casual players exist, and they do form guilds. We don't all have the goals you do. Stop projecting your minmax mindset upon the entire playerbase.
---
The chat bubbles also seem to go away faster in the retail client. Or is this a setting you can turn on/off?
---
in a way that's a downside for me!  last year i played a druid and got lucky on my first few dungeon runs and got most of my pre-BiS in like 3 days.  then in raids i naturally got my upgrades very quickly as 1 of 2 druids... so i ended up having no real reason to be there and it ended up being a bit of a raidlogging situation!

Again, to quote Kevin Johnson " "**were world buff meant to be used all at once? Yes** though we layer discovered that was a mistake"

They were meant to be used so. They later discovered that was a huge mistake, but hindsight is 20/20
---
Your profile pic is a Furry get your life together your into bestiality and animal sex you sick fuck.
---
Yeah, vanilla had pixelated font. The issue is that it's a different font altogether, not the size of it.
---
For bgs, Hpala is hands down the best defensive healer in the game, anyone that tells you otherwise has no clue what they're on about.
---
Pallies thrives in extended fights due to being the most mana efficient healers and they wear plate + shield so they're super hard to kill , plus you can't focus down a pally cause of bubble.
---
For solo play or the most survivability when solo, I'd say druids then pallies then priests.
---
Druids are usually better when they're allowed to run, dire bear form is turning into a prot warrior with a shield and being able to avoid most CCs and snares by running away makes them very slippery.
---
Paladins are usually preferred when you have to stand your ground and heal though, i've already explained in the first part why they're good.
---
Priests take more of an offensive role for alliance pvp, since you don't have shammies priests usually end up having to offensive dispel and stuff. Of all the alliance healers they're the squishiest when focused, priest is most susceptible to viper stings , they have the biggest mana issues out of all hybrids in the game and they suffer most from getting chain stunned.
---
I believe it's level 10 enchanting, not character level. Therefore you can in theory make the wand at character level 5 as long as you got the mats ready.
---
Then he said it was a mistake, and that it wasn't intended to be abused the way that it was. 
---
Checkmate again

Nah man, i did crack and played factorio. I succeed to stop doing crack. Still playing factorio.
---
Premade vs premade it will come down to stamina. If ally can survive the burst they will win most often.  I am really only talking about the super hardcore versions of the game. Pug vs Pug I take horde all day.
---
Not really, whats the difference between a PvE realm and an RP-PvE realm? There isn't one. You can go ahead and RP with people on a PvE realm and the other faction cant mess with you.
---
If your own faction is messing with you, then you probably rolled the wrong faction ;)
---
Every Man For Himself is pretty op
---
Is that minimum range calculated off of your melee attack range or the character position?
---
True, I was originally going to tank and that aspect did bother me a bit, but not that much since warriors have to tryhard in so many ways when tanking haha.
---
There will be trinkets rings etc to compete on, and probably a few more hunters than druids. Who knows maybe the meta will be absolutely random and you'll have more competition!
---
I'll be an ally holy priest so loads of competition lol

Uh, we had voice chat. Most guilds used ventrilo.

You need a good raid leader and a few competent sub-leaders (dkp, loot council, etc). It will take a lot longer to gear up than today’s game (I last played in pandas). There are people you will like doing stuff with and idiots you hate. Honestly a bit like a job.

It's less about time to OOM and more about a shorter cast getting interrupted or pushed back less.  It's very valuable.

another thing for me is that playing a hunter would mean random pvping and farming gold etc during downtime was more enjoyable.  trying to farm gold on a resto druid was just... i dont want to talk about it.  that was a large part of why i ended up raidlogging
---
Hahahahahaha yesss
---
It required more organization for sure. It was basically understood that if you aren’t one of the raid leaders, you don’t talk in voice unless addressed or outside of down time.
---
With 40 people you also have a number of people who just prefer to be quiet. Private whispers are used most of the time, or class/role chat channels.
---
Regarding the community aspect, I always had 6-10 folks in the raid who I was closest to and did stuff with outside of raids. Usually your class folks and a handful of others. Don’t get me wrong, I got along with most of the people in the raid and would’ve helped any of them, but with that many people some will be good friends and some will basically be strangers.
---
I mean that's how leeway works. It increases your melee range while moving. It has nothing to do with the minimum range of shots. The "proof" is the mechanic itself. 
---
That being said it only works while moving (!). That means your deadzone stays the same when e.g. a mage novas you, but it gets smaller when people try to walk inside the deadzone to kite you.
---
You can MC them and get an instant cast off yourself (like fort, shield, renew).
---
Any melee class is in a good spot. I think we all knew that Blizzards hard-on for melee classes would carry over to Classic.
---
Aye, they have a reputation as a great QoL main.
---
I didn't raid much back in vanilla as a healer , any thoughts on how holy priest will be for that?
---
I know pre Lasher's I won't have much in the way of options. Just hoping lasher nova farm is still OK! Or jump runs.
---
Its the conveyor belts. Like the trains in transport tycoon; you can sit down with a pencil and a piece of paper and work on layouts for hours on end and still not come up with something efficient ;)
---
[No True Alliance?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)
---
Pallies are the pillars of alliance premade healing , no idea what you're on about saying they're the least effective.
---
Priests are only brought in alliance premades for offensive dispels and shielding /mana burns, they have the biggest mana issues out of all healers and have the hardest time getting out of CC.
---
**No true Scotsman**
---
No true Scotsman or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule ("no true Scotsman would do such a thing"; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group).

Well then OP just managed to use the worst image ever to explain his point. 
---
The second screenshot is from vanilla but with an altered font. 
---
The first screenshot is from the beta with the original font and the new damage text renderer. 
---
So either you got the point wrong or OP is just dense as fuck.
---
I doubt you will have to resort to exploration leveling. It's more of a thing for private server launches were a million people are in the starting zones. Layering will prevent that being the case when classic launches.
---
I mean it's a bad parallel to draw on a 40 duel and a 60 anything. But then again, still pretty correct imo.
---

This is good advice if you plan on raiding current content, not many raid leaders are gonna want to bring people who contribute almost nothing and roll on loot against the people doubling their dps.
---
If meme spec is what you wanna do, you should be prepared to get denied raid spots frequently.
---
DS2 (not scholar) is just chalk full of group fights don't blame you.
---
this is current but that is vs same level mob/players. vs boss (lv 63) you'd need ~83% reduction to reach the 75% vs them.
---
It doesn't get buffed by bear form.
---
Did I say to leave out RP-PvE and put RP-PvP instead? RP-PvE should have it's own place next to RP-PvP.   
---
The sole thing Blizzard has to do is add an 'RP' tag to a PvP server. It has been proven that this attracts players open to RP and the general respect towards RP is far more greater than on a regular PvP server. There will always be griefers and trolls, but far less on an RP-PvP.
---
Actual factual
---
I have a [Human Route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) well fleshed out, and tested several times on beta / stress tests.
---
My full route was done personally on the last stress test. I've anticipated the route being a 3:30 - 4:00 experience, and it was pretty spot on. I dinged 10 @ "[Find The Lost Guards](https://i.imgur.com/aYje23t.jpg)" at 3:45. 
---
Fifteen minutes later, at the 4 hour mark, the route from the sheet was done (Hogger killed and turned in,) I was 65% of the way through level 10, and could have finished up the run to Sentinel Hill, and dinged 11 in another 10 mintues. 4:10 to 11 ain't bad when it's crowded.
---
Other Noteables: 
---
- [Flight points](https://i.imgur.com/VDHhz6a.png) - Stormwind, Sentinel Hill, Lakeshire, Thelsamar, Menethil Harbor, Auberdine, Darnassus
---
- All skills trained (aside from Seal of the Crusader, it's useless)
---
- Four 6 slot bags purchased from bag vendor (40 bag slots total)
---
- 7 Silver 53 Copper left over. Plenty to grab a stack of water and start some traditional leveling or grinding.
---
- Mail quest rewards in almost all equipment slots (no belt, accidentally sold gloves, and  I got a sweet 2 int 1 stam dress, so I decided to wear that)
---
- 15.5 Character Sheet DPS.

Things that could be improved:
---
- I picked up Herbalism and Alchemy. I was testing out if I could do "Elixirs for the Bladeleafs" while in Teldrassil. It's a load of XP and I plan on getting Herb / Alch while leveling, so mostly moot. But it's near impossible to get level 15 herbalism to start picking Earthroot, then find enough, to craft the elixirs before leaving the zone. 5-10 minutes improve if you don't take the professions.
---
- Lady Sathrah took 10-15 mintues longer than it should. I was hanging out at her location for about 15 minutes before someone else came along to help (duo'd at 7 and 9) - on a crowded launch, should be a lot faster. Vagash and Hogger were 1 minute. 10-15 min could be shaved off.
---
- I was dumb in Westfall and died on my way trying to get back to Elwynn to die there and rez to run to SW. I died again. 5+ minutes could be saved.
---
- I killed like 10 spiders for "Recipe of the Kaldorei" cooking quest. Might not be possible in a crowd.
---
All in all, this could be a 3:15 run if done better?
---
Though... the #1 takeaway I have from this?
---
#This was the most chill and relaxing 1-10 leveling experience I've ever had.
---
No stress, just go out and do all the things that nobody can stop you from doing.
---

---
Checkout the video, this was explained very well here.
---
It looks like a font that would be on a Game Gear game.
---
&gt; You are probably more accurate than I am which is why I guess Blizzard agreed to the language-specific servers.
---
I could also be completely wrong and overly optimistic. But since there is absolutely no metric to make any good estimate, it's all guess work.
---
Too bad the comments are mostly a pile of kids complaining about the interference during the tournaments, then saying how great PvP servers are and how PvE servers are trash. Apparently not thought through very well.
---
Idk. Rogue would be my second choice but seeing that front stabbing has been “fixed”, it’s going to be harder to level.
---
\^ This is the most accurate comment.
---
Lately I've been doing the 1-12 route over and over, preparing to get ahead of the launch day zerg. I'm down to three hours fifteen minutes with all five professions above 50, and 5 flight paths obtained. Trying to get that below three hours. Probably I'll have to scrap fishing.
---
Yeah well at 60 with gear, warriors pull ahead over hunters
---
Personally I love BElfs as a race/lore wise but they really did attract some of the worst players (like 15 year old me)
---
Is your minimum range based off your position or your melee attack range? I've seen people suggest that tauren have their minimum attack range pushed out, because the calculation starts at the outer edge of their hit box. 
---
I honestly don't know how it works. I've never had to check it.
---
We got da voodoo
---
Finally, some rationality. &lt;3
---
For the sake of 4 quid I want my name's, but it absolutely a dickbag move from.blizzard and they have lost further goodwill from me.
---
I was gonna buy a friend a gift from plushie store and decided on something else instead.
---
So they lost money from me overall by a large margin.
---
Could have went and got a nice adderall script for 0$ if your in the US amd have insurance.
---
Im planning on going my first 16 or so hours sober just water and light snacks (nuts/raising berrys) one 16 hours hits we bust out the adderall and shoot for approx 36 hours. Hoping to be around 30ish by the first day.
---
Your route looks well thought out indeed, but I haven't seen anything like it for any other race so it's hard to argue it's a valid leveling method for anything else than humans.
---
Besides, 4 hours to 10 is a bit long. Although I understand the value of "no competition" quests for a fresh start I never had that much trouble even on super stacked private server releases so it all seems a bit overkill and silly to me. :D
---
No, leeway has been confirmed to be correct. It works by adding 2.6 yards to your melee range if the attacker and attacked targets are walking. This also works for hunters, lowering the deadzone compared to what people believed it to be. At the same time though the shot minimum range is 3 yards further away than expected, so in the end it's the same as always (unless you're standing still).
---
Well I know what me and my buddies will do, which, if necessary, will extend to raid groups/class groups that need intensive comms. Join discord channel in the app and turn on PTT, then use desktop discord to join another private channel (it will only allow open mic on desktop, but you can use V.a. ) so that you can casually chat without ruining the raid comms, and still listen/contribute when necessary
---
There was just a big blank space separating Stormwind and Dun Morogh. In Cata it got turned into a huge chasm that ended in the one that separated Loch Modan from the Badlands IIRC
---
I feel like I remember reading that Stoneclaw totem actually breaks stealth as well. Seems kind of unlikely that a Rogue could get a good opener on a Shaman with that and Magma totem down.
---
Aww, the little manlet is angry :)
---
How do i speak less like a 14 year old?

Do i need to call you an imbecile to get on your level of maturity?

In Vanilla I played Alliance. When Burning Crusade hit, I went Horde (Blood Elf Paladin, shoot me - still my main to this day). Come Classic? I kinda wanna go back to Alliance, as I want to re-create my old characters. That said, if all of my current guild mates I'm going into Classic with wanna play Horde? I'll join 'em. But luckily for me the majority vote is for Alliance at the moment.

MY DWARF HUNTER'S COMIN' HOME!
---
It's an mmoRPG, that focuses on faction v faction warfare and exploration. 
---
To not have an Rp-pvp server is absolutely absurd, especially when they will provide rp servers, even though the rp-pvp players more than double the desire for a pve-rp.
---
When that t2 bonus proc you just want to shout “hunters unite! Full dps, rapid fire and dps trinket on!”
---
Hunters are awesome!
---
The guild dream
---
My only question is...
---
Why 156 pairs of adult diapers.
---
What are the easiest classes to gear up with crafting/BOE/gold? I’m in a situation where I have TONS of 20-60 min chunks of down time for fishing, AH manipulation, cloth farming, etc but cannot commit to blocking off 4+ hours for a raid. I’m able to play several hours per day, so it doesn’t matter how much gold/effort these items take.
---
Is there a class that can be strong in PVP and viable randomly as a bench raider without tons of BOP raid gear?
---
Aka a guild that isn't going to bring and gear a moonkin
---
That video doesn't say anything about leeway mechanics and how it impacts deadzones.
---
Not really, you can see in this beta clip https://clips.twitch.tv/BlitheOptimisticLatteAllenHuhu that leeway was increasing the range of the jumping Gnome while his target was standing still.
---
For a start, you can stop mindlessly regurgitating memes like a typical twitch kiddie.
---
Think it's going to be just a case of keep them at a "really" long arms length.
---
 I'm planning on rushing a hunter to 60 just to make it a dungeon farmer. So hopefully I will be a bit ahead of gankers and will only run into the odd skirmish and other levelers, so fingers crossed the leeway won't be to much of a hindrance in terms of wpvp. My alt will be ready for action which will be melee which is where I plan to do most PvP on.
---
I agree, but there are clearly issues with Blizzard moving things onto a new engine and then re-creating all the mechanics as they used to be. 
---
Many of us don't remember nor can we find solid, conclusive evidence of leeway. Yet, it's such a massively impacting thing. I'm not convinced Blizz is right on this one. They've made mistakes before
---
The number we're looking at here isn't part of the scrolling text.
---
Yes, I was trying to describe the non drowning method.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
Most shamans are orc...
---
As long as they keep the original servers untouched with no progression, I honestly couldn't give a shit.
---
Let people play what they want man. It's not like you're only allowed 1 char per account
---
So if you add distance for the inside reach (the melee range) it would extend the minimum range for ranged attacks?
---
I know there is a p\*ssy joke in there somewhere...
---
Except for that would likely end up being the largest pvp server by a wide margin if the rp-pvp community all decides on that particular server.  Then what happens when/if blizzard does finally make an rp-pvp server and allows transfers?  All the rest of the people on that server that only wanted pvp would be left with a nice big pop of about 1k people....yeah that's not good for anyone.
---
plot twist he's playing osrs
---
Damn life must be rough for you if this is the type of shit you’re upset about.
---
I think it's worth it if you were already planning to level tailor and enchanting anyway.  You can make some money on the side selling wands on the AH.  Otherwise just buy one.
---
I run retail right now on about graphic level 3,  flawless. 9 doesn’t work smoothly
---
For priest professions what I’m personally going to be doing is start with Skinning + Herb, drop skinning somewhere in the 40’s-50’s and pickup tailering until I get the robe recipe from strat. Then go to the final of Alchemy+Herb, at least I like proffs lol.
---
"casual raiding guild"
---
"be ready to work twice as hard"
---
Sooo, casual or nah?
---
If you really want to prioritize it get the UBRS key ASAP and reserve the skinning knife and the hide. People will probably be willing to let that slide for a brief time at the start.
---
Also get your BRD key and a rogue buddy and kill plugger for the chestpiece a couple times. Eventually you can solo that fight, but it's an easy enough farm and maybe they could use a barman shanker, incendious bracers, etc. You can also do some tricks in lbrs, sunken temple, etc.
---
We had a Warlock in our guild who would wand in MC on half the encounters and even after we brought it up, continued to do so. 
---
They would hand out healthstones like candy, banished properly on Garr, and always had a soulstone up on the healers.
---
We had no problem clearing each week, sure the extra dps could have helped, but if we survived just find with a lock doing practically 0 damage, a meme spec here and there isn't going to hurt anyone.
---
Its pretty common for young people online to insult others by calling them "kids".
---
Go back to retail.
---
This post gave me heartburn
---
Alright this one actually needs fixing.
---
You can change fonts but you can't change the way this text _behaves_. The size is too small, crits don't pop out, and the numbers go away faster.
---
&gt; now that voice chat is so abundant compared to the Vanilla days?
---
Voice chat was common during Vanilla as well. My guild used TS2, English speaking guilds more often went for Ventrilo. General rule was: Everybody keeps quiet unless they're either raid leader, one of his assists, or a tank (during boss fights that needed instant tank communication). Fore the rest, chat channels were used: Whispers, class channels, officer channels, party, etc.
---
Apart from that, it was just discipline and organization; We had calendars to coordinate who gets in which raid, and we had class leaders to ensure that every standing raid member of their class got fair treatment (not sitting out too often, disciplining no-shows, etc.). 
---
Of course, you weren't friends with everyone; A standard raid had about 60 active raiders, and depending on how active your were outside those raids, you were maybe friends with ten to 15 of those, knew 20 more, and the rest were acquaintances. You usually also knew a fair few people outside of raids, and not everyone you raided with, you liked. 
---
For example, we had a warlock I had had a bad run in while leveling - so bad, in fact, that he was the only entry on my ignore list when I hit 60). I notified guild lead about this, they took it under consideration, decided to keep him because he was one of only three WLs anyhow, and I just did my best to heal him just like everyone else - the raid comes before your personal gripes, as I saw it. For a month or two, everything went okay, even though he bitched and moaned his way into a good bit more than his fair share of loot (exacerbated by us only having those three locks, he completed his T1 before some of us even got their first piece), and promptly left us for a guild a bit further progressed than us, when he had gotten everything he could from us, and sported a dark red DKP score.
---
hunter new highest skill cap class 🧐
---
Agree. Except for some fresh servers e.g every six months or something.
---
Fair enough!
---
I remember it the other way around. In reality, I think they probably came out or at least became mainstream around the same time.
---
Shamans get some +hit also, ironically not in the enhancement tree, but still...
---
If you enjoy PvP then definitely go orc for that stun resist.  It's just a tier above every other racial.
---
Yeah! Remember, to be casual you need to play 2 hours a week, never raid, and your ass better not be in any class discord, or checking reddit! /s
---
r/gatekeeping
---
"Best"? That's an odd way to spell "worst"
---
Its not just the font, the numbers fall off faster, crits especially. And they seem a lot smaller as well.
---
I looked him up. I guess he mostly does Stacraft II which isn't my thing, but man is it refreshing to find a calm, cool streamer.
---
Very intressting never met people who called it the vanilla in vanilla.
---
If you have not seen Platinum's other content, do your self a favor.  The guy is genuinely funny and put an insane amount of effort into his content.
---
Remember when Blizz was like... "yeah Taurens are going to have the Plainsrunning talent"? 
---
Ha! 
---
Pshhhhhh, now we have thicc leather long bois. 
---
Much better.
---
Well imo the ability to increase the range for the nameplates is already a huge thing. I wish it wasn't possible
---
I made a large post discussing this question, [found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/?)
---
In it, there's a link to Cinebench R15 and Unigine benchmarks. I think those both work on Mac (the Unigine one does for sure). You can run those on your MacBook and compare your scores to give you an approximation of how your system would perform.
---
Don't forget: per region. It could potentially dilute the playerbase even more (see blizzard initially trying to keep EU relams together for this reason). I would love to play on rppvp myself, but I think it's important to note this.
---
It's just cheap nostalgia humor bud. If it bothers you, maybe reddit (and the internet as a whole) isn't a place you should visit.
---
Best. Thread. Ever.
---
This is so fucking cool!! great idea!!
---
End game progression literally didn't exist before though.
---
All throughout Vanilla, I've only ever met one player, a druid - he was in our raid - who argued from MC to Naxxramas that he wanted to play feral, because it was just so viable. Everyone else knew that their meme spec was shit and they didn't even bother, they knew their place and re-specced for every raid to their proper heal specs.
---
Yes it does.
---
I honestly expect nothing else from Platinum.  Has amazing effort in his content.
---
This sub is filled with the speed-leveling / min-maxing crowd.
---
You seem lovely
---
25th of july is conventiently just over 30 days after patch 8.2's release date. I can bet you that is the sole reason that they moved the date. Having more people subbed for longer looks better in the quarterly results.
---
Am I the only one think reforged would have sold better if they released it before classic
---
Just play the class you want. Stuff gets fixed
---
This is so true. I’d rather raid with some cool and fun people than to actually down onyxia or what that dragon’s called. So casuals really do exist and I’m gonna be playing and derping whatever I feel like. And yes, we are okay with not being able to do nax.
---
I don't think that would work.
---
Early cata was my favourite expansion and late cata was when I left wow, and this was because the community wanted to change PvE because it was too hard, didn't like reforging because "it is just another cookie cutter build" (I disagree), and a lot of minor things. 
---
Just because the majority of people have to agree  doesn't mean that they understand what a change will produce.
---
With the skill ceiling being high (my opinion) for druids, thats what Id take. The three specs are good for both pvp and pve!
---
Yes, and it was factually not present in vanilla. You can find MANY videos of mages Circle kiting with Cone of Cold and mobs not being able to melee at 6 yards away. Currently in the beta, mobs are able to hit you from outside untalented Frost Nova range when you're both moving.
---
It's completely borked.
---
Shadow is one of the top 1v1 specs in the game
---
That's nice and all but it just reads like you don't actually understand the difference between layering and Retail's sharding. Hint: You (are supposed to) stay in the same layer as people you know, your guildies, friends, etc - and only ever change if you join a group with someone, which already removes your first 5 or whatever points.
---
The only downside to it, assuming they fix it so you can't hop layers, is that you will eventually be met with people you've not seen before once they disable it, either at phase 2 or whenever servers can handle the population before that.
---
Because casual players are known for working twice as hard.......
---
That could be the reason as well, you're absolutely right.
---
How is spirit of redemption for pvp in a non PI build. You can still pick up imp mana burn and mental agility in disc or dip for min flay but IDK what kind of return on investment I'd be getting if i plan to get improved healing for 18 points as is. I plan to mainly dual with a physical buddy so PI is less enticing and silence could be an option.
---
Not being able to dispel seams a bit crappy but still topping every one off or renewing every one at full in a black smith fight sounds good when you inevitably get lasered down. Unsure how the quality goes up as gear comes out, you get more stam with pvp gear progression but you get lasered down by warlocks, mages, warriors and shaman when aq gear comes out. I do worry about missing grave yard rezes even if you quickly right click SOR or use a macro for that extra split second of delay.
---
For it's pve uses i could see for progression being useful on really close fights but more niche there unless you have a few druids. Likely makes dungeons and world pvp better as you always do something even if you get focused down first.
---
i remember there being sweaty forum posts about this on the original forums. "you wouldnt be able to get it without the group vs you wouldnt be able to get the hide without a skinner" ad nauseum 
---
that plus rogues vs hunters for rends
---
i never saw one drop either
---
Any fellow Kerbals out there?
---
I'm probably gonna get couple footlongs or cater some subways and alot of water. Maybe 2 energy drinks but thats about it.
---
There will be no pvp camping with layering.  You can simply spam general for invites until you shift layers, then keep going.  Fun.
---
Do you know if there is a mail cap in game? I know in pservers you can only send so much mail before it says you’ve sent too much.
---
[Every few hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search/?q=layering&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new). I would be surprised if there was anything new to be said.
---
and why is he getting energy drinks ... introverts is obviously the way to go!   
---
and dont forget the feeding tube down the nose !
---
I would say I was friends with everyone in the guild. I was often a raid leader when we would be split up for things like ZG or AQ20. I pretty much got everyone and their alts Warlord's commands done. We had some garbage loot system that people would get very dramatic about, but I generally didn't have to pay attention to it as I was playing a druid. We used ventrillo, and I think that generally it was just the raid lead, MT, or guild leader talking when things were serious, but we were raiding or pvping many hours a night and it was pretty relaxed.
---
Also to support a 40 man guild you will probably have more than 40 players, and that too leads to drama. I will say it is a lot harder to wrangle that many people. Somehow our guild lead would pick up prospects from other servers pretty frequently. Depending on your server you may have lots of applicants or you may find your players that get geared are getting poached, and as there's just so many people you kind of need to know who you "trust" especially with regards to big resource sinks like thunderfury.
---
Oh I thought they just changed front not how combat text behaves... That's is a big deal tbh... Will ruin satisfaction from big crits....
---
Not 100% sure on that
---
Yup :(
---
Mage kiting is dead and all the desperate Warrior mains want to keep it that way because it benefits them.
---
I've been hyped for Classic since the day it was announced, but this shit isn't vanilla. It's Legion wearing Vanilla's skin...
---
Yes private servers have it wrong. This is common knowledge
---
More nostalgia than anything and the bottles were cool, this was early 200s well before vault came out
---
Lmao no. That’s not true.
---
Right, how many casual feral druids are going to be willing to spend a couple hours before every raid farming crowd pummelers just to keep up on dps?
---
Why do you want nothing to happen for an eternity? Now they finally have a chance to do WoW right. Expanding gameplay but keeping core values
---
Do you know if it would be able to highlight player  nameplates with an addon?
---
Not really. Switch over to your primary/bank alt and keep a Lvl 1 of the opposite faction in a major city and /who 'camper' every couple minutes -- when you see he's gone, go back to your main. 
---
I'm probably going to activate a 2nd account to roll Horde and Alliance on the same server (not specifically for this purpose -- but it's a nice perk).
---
&gt;You (are supposed to) stay in the same layer as people you know, your guildies, friends, etc - and only ever change if you join a group with someone, which already removes your first 5 or whatever points.
---
The implication of your comment is you are joining the game with a guild/ friends, and anyways it doesn't ruin my points in any way, shape, or form.
---
Guilds are so big in vanilla it was always groups of groups of friends.    Me and my friends would be 5-10 of the members of the guild.    And everyone else is just someone you might group with for something using /guild while lfm for stuff.
---
It's multiplicative so it doesn't matter in which order you apply them.  The result is 5.06 \* base armor.  1.1 \* 4.6 = 4.6 \* 1.1 = 5.06
---
I've always wondered, does the floaty yellow part bounce around? Can they take it off and put it back on? What if you hit something with the back side of the sword? 🤔
---
it's about how combat text behaves not the font change... it should be thicker when you crit
---
Zhevra hooves...  I killed so many of them they basically endangered now.  I should have gotten 4 by now.
---
Posts like this check off a few points in the "unnecessary" box.
---
-No one's complaining about Shamans. What posts are you referring to? Why did it prompt this unneeded PSA?
---
-Mages are beat by a helluva lot more than just Ele shamans. Warlocks and Spriests say "Hi".
---
-Elemental Shamans **are OP** in PvP. But you know what? Who gives a fuck. We are getting 1.12, with (as of yet) no indications of class balance changes, so why is this even a topic? This isn't Retail where you need to proactively/reactively post on forums to hopefully head off some kind of balance nerf. There is likely never going to be any kind of buff/nerfs. *For good or for bad*. Ele shamans will remain OP in pvp, warriors will be kings of both tanking and Dps in raids, and absolute Gods in PvP with a heal-buddy. Its just how it is.
---
Just another unnecessary post tackling a non-issue that almost nobody is complaining about, to potentially prevent a nerf/buff outcry that will amount to nothing anyways, because #nochanges.
---
Just a quick note: your perspective on the difficulty on vanilla doesn't take into account, that this kind of gameplay was new to 95% of the players. If you compare retail and vanilla encounters, you have to take the environment and the time into account. Vanilla was hard for the noobs, retail might be hard for veterans, I don't know.
---
Sure, if the retail veterans now switch to classic, the mechanics might hardly challenge them. But that doesn't mean that the mechanics were a joke back in the day when people were new to this genre.
---
This is so sick! If your doing others consider perditions blade!
---
Most people won't do it, I don't want to do it, but there will be many people who will abuse the system just because they can. The system doesn't make the game better in any way. Toxic chat? Just ignore people or simply don't be so weak that you get hurt by a random person on the internet saying a bad word, turn on mature language filter. Easy fix. No system to abuse. If someone is cheating, people will take the effort to write a report and they will get banned regardless.
---
Anyway, probably all chat will just move to discord where we can speak freely without fear of getting banned I guess.
---
Classic wow does not take advantage of multiple cores.
---
This is confirmed by the directX version in BFA and classic.
---
so yea, the new amd is good value , but that doesn't necessarily translate into better performance for WoW versus current intel CPUs. 
---
It would not surprise me at all to see the i5-9600k beat the new AMDs in singlecore performance.
---
Pretty sure it is number 1.  With the way armor is multiplied from gear it is easy to think Thick Hide might get the same treatment.  Sadly I think it is just 10% on top of 360%, so 370%.  Definitely good if you are raid tanking, but while leveling up you can pick more useful talents on your way down the tree.
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, they were wearing suit jackets, too.  They looked like they wanted to be taken seriously.   Are you implying that the shit quality was all meant to be a joke? Because I did not get that impression.
---
rp-pve has rp, pve doesn't, you could use that daft logic with a rp-pvp too.
---
Yes, you are supposed to be placed in the same layer, again with your friends and guildies - That is supposed to be how it works. It is not meant to be a random layer whenever you relog. At least, that's how it was initially described. If they got that to work on the beta or not, I don't know.
---
I'm just trying to summarize everything to show ALL of the negative aspects of layering.  I'm hoping that people will see the combined effect this will have on multiple aspects of the game and it will change their opinion.
---
Dishonorable kill system.  Town raids went from a daily event to something that happened once a month at most.
---
That's why I'd quit if they release TBC. I don't like how they make all previous content useless. How the old cities get emptied out. I realize that originally they did it because they wanted to bring in casuals by saying, look, it doesn't matter if you never raided a day, you can go get better loot then BWL by level 62! And it worked but everytime I replaced an epic that I worked for and had a story behind it with some random green quest reward I was sad. I would like to see them go horizontal so as not to break up the community, not to waste Azeroth and Durotar, and to avoid walking down the same path that lead them to retails current state. The original decision to start making big expansions that invalidated all previous content was a short term winner but I think that concept will destroy the game every time. Grow what you have, don't throw it away every couple years chasing new subscribers at the expense of your old subscribers.
---
That's fine. I got lots of anime to catch up on.
---
Skinning/ tailoring til 40+. After that grind to 60.
---
When I’m done with my pre-BIS I’m gonna play more chill, dropping skinning for something else and start making BANK maxing profs while grinding.
---
Mages have 1 class they’re bad against 1v1? What about hunters, warlocks, druids?
---
Fuck them, they are weak and useless and will quit vanilla before level 20 anyways.
---
Yeah i know blizzard prefer to generate money for their shareholder at the expense of the players. If it become a shitshow i will leave anyway, might as well stay on private server if they offer a better experience.
---
TLDR - another bad post on layering
---
A 5 ilvl increase between tiers is not enough for progression.  Problem would be two-fold.  Upgrades won't be impactful and guilds could skip tiers.  For instance, your MC geared players could probably step straight into Naxx.
---
Common opinion is that a talent that relies on you dying is not a very good talent.  I would tend to agree.  If there's *really* nothing else to spend that point in, then sure... but priests have so many good nodes that I don't think you should be getting it.
---
One RPPvP server on central time zone. Would work for both east and west coasters.
---
K.
---
Yeah it is almost as if that term didint exist for wow back then , unbelievable right ? Let him live in his fantasy.
---
The optimization includes giving everyone primary targets with little to no overlap.
---
Uncontrolled cross-healing leads to a lot of overhealing and thus wasted mana.  
---
The idea is that everyone first cares about their assigned targets and only when there's nothing left to do there, they heal someone else.  
---
The better coordinated the healers are, the fewer of them a raid actually needs.
---
Anno 1800.  I had never played any from that series before and this game blew my mind.  The last "city builder" I played was Sim City 20 years ago, no kidding.  You can put tons of hours into this game.  I found myself looking at the clock and realizing it was 2 AM and I had lost all track of time.  It has been a long time since a game did that to me.
---
Hurricane was the 31 point talent when I started at launch, if I'm remembering correctly. Innervate was the resto 31 point, so that's where you went to PVP or else you'd OOM.
---
Getting camped by higher levels.
---
It's cancer for sure and it pisses the hell out of me but i'd never want it gone.
---
Because that's just some inconvenience that makes the whole world fleshed out.
---
Retail started taking those things away and locking people away from danger and look where that got us.
---
It's a zone I've never been to. At least I don't think I've been there pre-cataclysm. Desolace and Ferelas too. Spent most of my time in Eastern Kingdoms. I want to explore Kalimdor for the first time.
---
Running a wow server req. Almost nothing
---
That puts you 5 lvls behind on spirit tap.  At least get one point before you max wand spec.
---
You should increase the cons list of server clusters and include all the cons involved with merges.
---
Fractured communities and economies are just as bad if not worse with merges than layering.
---
Reading it sounds like you have an issue with layering and aren’t being genuine.
---
Leveling is great, but the end-game raid scene is toxic as f@ck.  Not kidding.  Up until this it is everything you remember and love about EQ though.
---
here before every neck beard browsing fresh shoots this post down because they don’t like the L word
---
Now the pvp almost doesnt exist outside ouf instanced battlegrounds , arenas other than few high levels ganking lowbies. You are right. I remember town raids and ambushes in the wilderness.
---
What is yelp?
---
Yeah it looks like vanilla was 11 yards, which lines up with the beta at 11 yards
---
People can play whatever they want, but if they play a meme spec they have no right to complain that they are not accepted to some groups. Easy. 
---
If you have a realistic expectation and don't complain about things that you knew about when you chose your spec, you can do whatever you like.
---
That doesn't even make logical sense man even if that was true, which I have hard zero evidence of.  You change layers when you're invited to a group.  So your guildies and friends will be in all different layers from joining groups all the time.
---
Even if you were somehow always in layers with friends/guildies, it doesn't change any of my points; if you don't have friends/guildies you'll end up in random layers.  And if you do have friends/guildies, you'll still have people around you jumping layers and never have a cohesive player body.
---
I would think classic would run closer to how BFA currently runs. I would just plan to run low to mid settings, some settings specifically can be turned down to gain a decent amount of FPS to the point where it should at least be playable 
---
Now trying to do raids might be a whole different story as far as FPS
---
Sure it did. It's pretty heavily implied, when I refer to players being better on average today, and even go so far as to give 2 examples of why that might be the case - playing retail or pservers. I didn't get into an exhaustive list of other reasons we might be better players now, but it should be obvious.
---
And even if you don't see the correlation, or if we assume I didn't include that perspective, then it doesn't really matter does it? The end-point is the same and nothing is refuted for it's omission.
---
The biggest difficulty will be logistical, not mechanical.
---
The best weapons for tps and best weapon for defensives. I for myself don't care about dps as tank.
---
omnomnom sweet gnome
---
Never as many people as in sw, if or org. And not even close to comparable to Outland.
---
I remember seeing them on G4 (later G4TV) at E3 and all of the LAN parties and tournaments. I always wanted them, but never tried one until a few years ago.
---
I'm not sure mate but again, blizzard are very against addons that give a competitive advantages and have broken addons in the past that do.
---
Id sya this probably falls into that catagory but I could be wrong. I'm just another player like you =)
---
it's not about skill caps, poly resets are just way too strong
---
edge posting on the interwebs. who's autistic? xD
---
This is a fair criticism and I'll edit the post to do this.
---
HOW ABOUT THOSE XREALM BG’S!!!
---
League of legends as I have for the past 7 years and I seriously can’t wait to never play this game.
---
We gave ours to the nicest old lady that wasn't even a raider. She made flasks for everyone with all her free time.
---
Unless you were doing AV, in which case it was probably the opposite which was being yelled.
---
haha great video, I knew I recognised that video style from GTA 5
---
It's all the same as a PvP server but can only be attacked if you toggle PvP on. Obviously dont go walking into other factions towns and cities. Keep away from patrolling guards as if they hit you it will toggle you on (tarren mill patrol springs to mind).
---
Khara was supposed to be in vanilla. Hellfire was supposed to just be a zone. Hyjal, ulda were planned for vanilla. Really their greedy decision to sell a full priced game as the expansion meant they took a bunch of planned content for vanilla and moved it into TBC so that everyone would be forced to buy it. I think a 10 man khara with loot on par with ZG would be great.
---
The interesting thing is that it might be cheaper to take existing content and retune it for classic then to release a whole second and third version of the game that has to run in tandem especially since multiple versions would just fracture your player base and not necessarily grow it.
---
Really fun game, playing around with it now.  Once you get your kingdom in Act 2 and you have to manage it with the interface, meh.  Just starting on this part, maybe it will grow on me, but I just want to adventure and kill stuff.
---
It does.
---
Dungeons and raids, anything that involved 2-4 hours of repetition with little fun where you were entirely at the mercy of other people not screwing up. Other than one run through BFD I won't be touching them in Classic.
---
Faps don't make you immune to damage
---
Takes more effort then a pizza itself, it is a balancing act of is it going to melt my mouth off or be an ice cold brick.
---
&gt; If they know each other prior they add each other
---
Again, this is making the assumption that you are joining the game with a guild and friends, and that your friends will be in your guild.
---
&gt;After that, the people they meet in-game will be from that same layer, because how else will you see anyone else? You won't.
---
This is so untrue.
---
Chat is server-wide, not limited to layers, so anyone who joins up via chat will hop layers.  People will be hopping layers *all the time*.   Your guildmates will be changing layers.  Your friends will be changing layers.
---
There is ZERO "From that point they will be in the same layer"
---
I'm still going to play hunter as my first due to the fact they are great at farming. It's a good set up if you plan to gear a alt out. Which will be rogue for me :)
---
You could also just read the billion of other layering posts that talk about all the points you mentioned. I'm 99% sure there won't be a single layering post until release that shows new pros or cons. This stuff has been talked about a lot, and you clearly haven't read any of them, or you wouldn't make some of these points.
---
&gt; leaks of 3600

Nope, you won't.

hey im planning on playing cookie cutter 0/5/46 resto shaman but i was wondering if it was ok for my friend to play a meme spec in solo content and 5 mans or if that's not ok with you
---
I've provided the how-to on discovering the source many times in this thread.
---
Thanks! I was mainly thinking of upgrading as I see some prices may drop. The processor runs fine for WOW/private servers and I can push 120+ frames on high settings in non cities. Would you have any recommendations for motherboards.  I mainly need to upgrade mine as it was pulled from a prebuilt and does not support as many inputs as I need for fans etc
---
That was about right-click report, not auto-squelch. Try again.
---
The main issue with the crit aura is that warlocks and fire mages are usualy already threat caped even without the crit aura so it will only make it worse
---
Imbalance in classes.
---
The only viable tank practically being Warrior to be taken serious in a raid.
---
Didn’t really truly get to choose what you want, unless you don’t mind not being taken seriously, or knowing you would be holding back the team, or knowing you could be doing better as a different class.
---
The knowing you could be doing better as a different class, or stuff may not seem bad to most people but I used to take PvE incredibly seriously, so as a spec / class that wasn’t good for DPS or anything I always felt bad that I could have been something like Mage and done better nearly in every way during late raids (I was a hunter back then)
---
Onyxia's lair drops tier 2 loot.
---
most items are ilvl 71-76 outside of the trash greens and blues she drops.
---
Not sure if you're referring to me or OP.
---
But are you immune to the stun effect?
---
Does TSM not do this?
---
No its not. And how exactly do you quantify "breaking the game"? You can do enough dps to skip the sons on rag without consumes or buffs in prebis gear.  Are you breaking the game by never even seeing that mechanic, in prebis gear?
---
Prebis gear is cheating then?
---
I can dual wield tank zg, MC, some BWL without world buffs in gear from that raid tier. Also cheating?
---
Healer regen is very often completely irrelevant regardless of world buffs.
---
Skeram illusions bugging out sounds like just a p server bug.
---
I preordered vanilla.
---
I've been playing Warcraft since DOS
---
I remember the class channels.  In our guild druids were really unpopular, but I (priest) and my other friend (mage) were friends with this druid, so we hung out in his class channel to shoot the shit and vent about our guild, it was pretty awesome.
---
I think the old numbers being pixelated bugged me way more tbh. but I can see why people would want the old stuff back.
---
"Haha I'm just trollin' bro calm down xD"
---
Raided as a warlock and you definitely want tailoring, more for bloodvine than robe of the void as the set is irreplaceable for PVE content up until naxx.
---
The points are not wrong.  Either you legitimately don't understand layering or you have no counter so you're just avoiding the topic while spamming hate.
---
This is awesome
---
Feral is viable though.
---
It was a point of pride to be accepted into a channel of a different class, that’s great.
---
Back in closed beta, you didn't even have the option to use specs. So few of us yet such a great memory!

Can you go into more depth about snspshotting clearcasting?
---
I didn't see any posts that list pros / cons that captured the totality of negative effects layering has.
---
And you'd lose your money.
---
Exactly. They decided to wrap everyone up in cotton wool incase the wrath babies unsubbed.
---
In Vanilla, it was the [Wife Agro]. I had to leave our MC raid and go pick her up from the train. Not a big deal - just pop out and hurry back, right? 
---
However, as soon as I got back the raid had just looted the second Bindings of the Windseeker. The very one I needed to complete the Thunderfury. We had been farming for months and now our guild had two warriors, each with the opposite bindings.
---
Like the chair from Idocracy lol
---
This is actually a huge thing, albeit looking so insignificant and small (no pun intended). It just adds so much more authenticity to the combat and the feeling of landing a crushing blow.
---
Hopefully this will raise awareness. If not, I really wish some awesome friendo pal would make an addon that brings back that precise font.
---
Change that to Resists and you're now leveling a caster.
---
They are in fact wrong, or completely absurd.
---
I mean seriously. One of your points was it ruins immersion because thinking about what layer you are in is distracting from the world. Is that a joke?
---
You’re welcome mate ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) , I hope you will always have good moments in this game.
---
Obtaining a lesser magic wand should be the top priority for every spell casting class. It significantly out-DPS's all low level spells and it costs no mana to use, so it drastically reduces downtime as well.
---
Might work, although the horde is a skull so can probably see the stealth fairly easily
---
Agreed 100%. When leveling the OP classes, like warlock and hunter, they're best off leveling via mobs/quests of equal or 2-3 levels higher than them. 
---
While melee on the other hand should focus on leveling via quests/mobs that are 1-2 levels UNDER them. The speed of kills on slightly underleveled mobs significantly outweighs the exp difference for each kill.
---
Off topic: I'm surprised you aren't shilling for "server that rhymes with tronos" over Classic WoW.
---
What's the major differences between lvling in 1.12 and previously? I also started just after BC so I'm unfamiliar with the changes made before that :)
---
ok i will txt u when it happens what's ur phone number
---
This. I preordered it as well, was even in the closed beta...I was older than 4, though.
---
Those winds do blow ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
What do you guys think the best way to get tailoring 300 the fastest is for Truefaith vestments? Should I be leveling tailoring as I go or wait until 40/60 to start?
---
While 7 skinners lag behind the rest of the raid, all trying to get the click and skin them haha
---
Can someone let me know when bullshit posts like this stop popping up. K thx appreciate ya
---
I remember alot of pretty young people playing in vanilla. Like they'd be on their parents account. One girl in my guild had 2 kids who played on her account. They were like 10 and 12. So I don't think its unreasonable that alot of people did "play" vanilla. I see alot of posts that admit to "playing vanilla but not reaching 60" or the like. The actual accounting of raiders in vanilla is probably fairly low, but with PS players some people who talk about raiding are probably referencing PS raiding rather than true vanilla.
---
In the end it doesn't matter. We're all about to take the ride again together.
---
&gt; I have zero evidence. 
---
FTFY
---
I’m one of the few who’s right on the fringe I’d say. I started playing at the end of vanilla but didn’t really know what I was doing or do any raids (hell, didn’t even hit 60 until BC). I’m looking forward to having those small hits of nostalgia but also experiencing something new in a game I never fully played.
---
You can have progression through items. Blizzard has been doing that in the diablo universe for over a decade. Maybe not rune word level power or anything, but with set bonuses and unique affixes on weapons, you could in theory have a game that offers the upgrades and customization players want and still have a product that you can play "forever".
---
Add resistances or something to the sets that make them necessary to progress into the next tier of content, but dont inflate the numbers. Just give the item some new modifier that now gives whatever class is using it a new thing to utilize.
---
Sockets could be another possibility, gemming gear in a certain way for example could make the armor function in a different way depending on the class and play style, not just add stam or int etc, but actually add ranks of spells or an aura or some other passively useful mechanic.
---
My point is, we dont need bigger numbers to have a lengthier more customizable experience as time goes on. Blizzard needs to look inward and use what they know works. I feel like they could really have a winning formula with some creative additions to the loot table down the road.
---
Everyone who wants to play an enhance shammy, and not just be a totem buff, shadow priest for pve, or ret paladin most definitely didn't play vanilla.
---
you havnt played enough pservers to see why that is a bad idea

Nice name, horrifying and creepy movie.
---
Bad post.
---
Oh, must've changed recently. If that is the case then I don't really care about the font, personally.
---
When the economy and immersion is better on a private server, I'd say it's less than awesome.
---
What I found on a Pserver is that leveling with the purpose of filling your first aid and cooking skill in an RPish sort of way REALLY makes playing warrior fun and enjoyable a lot more.
---
Goalposts: moved
---
Sorry, you're right, let's stick to memes and 'what class will you play' threads.
---
We get a raid of 40 hunters and we wont need healers
---
Really valid point and I like the way you responded. Some of the other responses (ie adding to rogue poison/bleed) is what I was thinking. Ultimately it will probably be whatever Bliz sees will increase/maintain the player base, which in the past has been stat scaling.

i love old orgrimmar
---
CringeKing op is actually retarded if this is not a joke
---
No, grey items can be masterlooted too.
---
This was the explanation I was looking for. I want to try a p serve r but don't know which ones would be reliable this late in the game with classic rolling out soon.
---
TSM imports at the beginning of your play session. The helper program simply keeps the file updated minute to minute so when you do log in the correct information is shown.
---
Not kill them, make use of them "like the locals"
---
Only raid leader and class leaders spoke in our raids. Raid leader organized the set up of the raid and led the raid while class leaders kept everyone in line and made sure we were doing what we needed to do in raids.
---
Ninja invites for the "core" raiders were sent out first, then the leader would post in guild chat something like, "rogues pst for raid invite, no invite means full". Then you pray for a spot.
---
Most people never knew everyone in the raid, we kind of split into our little social groups. I had maybe 7 or 8 people in the raid I actually spoke with and did things on a daily basis but it was still fun.
---
Hunters rolling on everything! Rage!
---
No trouble with the current proessor, but with new ones coming out, I see prices may fall of the current gen. Mainly I need a new motherboard to support my new peripherals, so I was wondering if a good combo existed or if I should even bother replacing my CPU.
---
I wasn’t frustrated til mid cata. I could deal with BC and LK although I did miss vanilla. I enjoyed early cata a lot but it wasn’t until mid cata that I realized what not being able to go to old Azeroth meant.
---
sup noun this is syletarius if u remember me from ely/light
---
easy to get pre raid gear
---
head - either the head for ubrs - but if u are looking for something before ubrs keys are up u might get a craftable - dreamweave circlet (if the rec is in game) or spellpower goggles if u are engi , otherwise  casandra's grace/papal fez both boe and if not just a stat stick from maradon princess  eye of theradas and if not just any int/spirit stastick
---
neck - a simple stat stick from maraudon is almost as good as ubrs neck - tooth is better but those are just stat sticks - nothing special until phase 2 out there
---
back - there isn't much out there - archivist is the only choice for aly otherwise any statsticks while horde can get raincaster drape
---
shoulders - u just cant go wrong with living shoulders - fairly cheap super strong craftable
---
chest - nothing can compare with robes of the exalted - its a bitch to farm but your bis until bwl/aq (arguable since t2 chest is meh +healing wise) - before that u might get robes of royal crown or living breastplate (to expensive imo for the +healing it provides) - if torva pathfinder questchains (the class quests for sunken temple) are in the game forest's embrace is super strong choice as well
---
wrist - any statstick will be fine - the boe magister bracers would be superstrong and bis are the ones u mentioned from lbrs bleak howlers

hands - hands down brd princess gloves
---
waist - hands down the boe belt (still i wouldnt bother spending money on it and just get magister , replace it with boe mc set  and craft corehound once bwl comes out , maybe get dm belt whipvine cord - but again thats the cheap alternatives)
---
legs - living leggings are super strong and easy to craft (only expensive part would be cured rugged and u only need 1) can use them without issues until t2 from rag
---
boots - best boots are from strat ud rare spawn Stonespine - verdant footpads - otherwise u can get ubrs boots or the 3 or 4 different healing boots from brd
---
rings - hands down 2 best rings are going to be fordring's seal and rosewine circle form lbrs summonable - eye of argimmar/songstone of ironforge instead of rosewine is fine as well
---
trinket - 2 trinkets from brd second wind and burst of knowledge (or briar either way there will be caster tears) aftrrer that we just grab dm trinket lol
---
wpns - 1 h mace from 7dwars in brd has no equal - u could use scarlet cathedral mace lol - for oh thaurissan's royal scepter from brd is bis - u can use spirit of aquamentas as well its not bad until u can farm up the brd oh
---
anyway cool to see you back

---
Uh, no he means bot that can do things like immediately target and dot a rogue if it gets close or counterspell at the last second of a spell cast.
---
It isn't possible. It was for a couple of weeks early in the closed beta, but it was fixed before the level cap was increased to 40. 
---
Nameplate distance is now as it was in vanilla.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
You seem to have missed the point. You could still do the same motion but from further away.
---
There is a distance at which you can hit the mob and the mob can hit you and a yard further you cannot hit the mob and the mob cannot hit you.
---
When you build a group for a dungeon and there’s “that guy/girl/person” who would prefer to continue questing and request the warlock summon them. 
---
It gets more annoying when everyone else is making their way there, but the one player who wants the summon.
---
Ah. Either way though, both were before classic,so they were both available at classic release. Guilds and groups just had their preferences it seems.
---
Even if there was an internal cooldown on auto-attack WF procs in vanilla, it's basically irrelevant. Anyone running enhance spec was already using a 3.0 or slower weapon. I know for a fact that any theoretical ICD had no effect on other WF proc triggers like HoJ. Even in late patches, it wasn't uncommon to WF on 1st auto and trigger HoJ which triggered WF again. Four autos in an instant. 
---
The infinitely stacking WF procs of the pre-1.4 days were long gone, but those quad WF hits were still commonplace.
---
This is the core of several problems that Classic is going to have IMO. If you want absolutely "No Changes" you get stuff like this that makes the experience worse.
---
Besides the melee leeway problem stemming from "this is how it was, lol", you also have the difficulty of the dungeons and raids, which are going to feel much (much) easier to everyone than they did to people back then, due to a) full knowledge beforehand, b) people are in general more skilled at wow now c) very few people will experience lag/connection issues, whereas back then a ton of people were playing with bad internet and 7-10 fps lol. All content except maybe late AQ and Naxx is going to get absolutely steamrolled by most guilds which is going to make raiding lose its luster really fast and more people will quit than would have otherwise.
---
Can you not do this in discord? Would you have to have two up at once?
---
I did my warlock class quest back in the day and there were people that would help you get it for free. Also others who would sell it to you. 
---
The level 40 one was just the riding training and the cost to learn the spell. Remember that learning spells cost gold at the trainers in vanilla. The level 60 one involved a semi long quest chain where you had to gather items and go to dire maul. From memory, it was still cheaper than paying for a lvl 60 mount the traditional way.
---
Paladins also had a class mount. I did the paladin class mount in early BC when I leveled my alt. I remember I used to farm Scholomance in BC for dark runes and I sold those along with primal fires to earn my epic flying. The dark runes fetched a nice amount due to their use in the paladin quest chain.
---
Dogs the loot?
---
If you enjoy retail then we simply want different things from Classic.  You might not have issues with many of the things I listed.  That's fine, there's nothing wrong with that, I just want the vanilla experience.
---
Also, the implication of your post is that guild=everything.  Again, that might work for you, but that's not true for many people, myself included.  For me, recurring interaction with players outside my guild on my server on *both* factions as friends and enemies.
---
Again though, it's likely we just want different things.
---
&gt;even longer as a bot
---
???
---
Yeah I remember 75% being the cap.
---
Mobs: Off
---
Players: On
---
I've never seen the need for mob nameplates. If something is close enough to read the name above the head it's close enough to identify what it is. With mobs off if you see a red name above anything, then it's a player. If not, it's a mob. If you're looking for a specific mob, that's why we scan tooltips with the mouse.
---
The OP lol I guess I was super clear.
---
I ran the stress test on a lenovo ideapad on the lowest graphics w/ very minor frame rate drops. Hung around 40-50 most of the time. That computer is ass. Yours will run it.
---
I remember this the other way around. Vent was ugly looking and a pain to set up. Then team speak came along and was the fancy good looking thing that 1 person in our guild wanted everyone to switch too but it causes too many issues with people's mics.
---
I was very much against the griefers during the tournament but reading the back story now I can kinda understand thier point I guess?
---
Imagine preparing for an event your whole (beta) life only to be told on the day that only the rich and famous can take part.
---
You mean, every hardcore progress raider should have engineering. Don't tell newbies it's mandatory cause it's not
---
you can already look at your guild character list and sort by lvl xD
---
yes, it was not in the patch notes Eversor.  They did announce during the reveal at 2017 Blizzcon that WoW Classic will be based on the 1.12 build of the game.  Every other announcement, they are telling people they are using the 1.12 version.  They did not reveal they would sprinkle in stuff from 1.11, and stuff from 1.09, and stuff from 1.04, until they decided it would "felt it was added (or necessary) for preparing."  Or that they would purposely leave in bugs that occurred in the same version of the game, only to remove the mount system that was in the version of the game until your cited interview.  Even if right before that patch, the bugs did not exist for the entirety of the game up till then.
---
One thing to note is that some of the most difficult mechanics from vanilla have almost entirely disappeared from retail wow - threat ceiling is pretty much a non issue in retail wow, along with a number of other things that may surprise even retail vets. Another thing to note is that private servers have quite a few things wrong in their raids that make things considerably easier, especially related to tanking.
---
I'm looking forward to the experience. Sure, mechanically it's not nearly as complex, but it's not going to be as trivial as most people seem to expect. But the largest problem by far is going to be the logistics. Managing 40 people is far more difficult than 25
---
My guess is a sort of magically magnetic functionality.
---
Perhaps an enchantment of returning so it always comes to the same spot in relation to the blade?
---
I’d imagine it may have some give if hitting with the back, but would probably be rigidly “magnetized” to keep alignment with the blade.  So hitting would cause it to collapse into the blade, but spring back without issue and without deviating to the left or the right.
---
Trash bags are much more economical than Depends.  And you'll probably only need one.
---
That's what flight paths are for.
---
Seriously, people treat streamers like they're fucking royalty or their opinions matter more than others.  It's ludicrous.
---
that Leeway feels a lot like what I remember of being killed in vanilla while running away constantly thinking "he's like 30 feet away wtf"
---
True that.
---
EVERY raider SHOULD have engineering.  
---
what part of this are you not understanding?
---
Or you could have a good spec work twice as hard and pull theor weight x2?
---
&gt;Save
---
Cringe.
---
Calm down
---
&gt;I can see my criticism is fair I can also see you obviously have a hate-boner with layering and aren’t going to be genuine in the pro’s and con’s here.
---
As opposed to you, who focused on one of twenty things I listed and implied it was a world-ending event?
---
I have been personally been through server merges that were not bad, so I know for a fact they aren't the end of the world.  Not to mention: not every server will need to merge without layering, and even with layering some servers might need to merge.
---
Thank you, this was really helpful. 
---
Looks like I need to watch more of these videos to figure out my path before I commit.
---
class coloring added, gonna think about class based leaderboards this weekend ;-)
---
Melee is going to be a breeze on classic compared to privates
---
Random dungeon finder was the last straw for me.
---
I used to play on a 2007 MBP back in BC. It worked fine until Blizz started increasing the spell effects everywhere. You should be fine with your 2014 MBP.
---
They are all great. Druid and Shaman possible overall most utility and or options though. Chainheal is a beast and can so heavy dps in pvp. Druid on the other hand got so much tools and tricks. Overall priest is the safest choice for a pure healer.
---
Everyone would roll on everything...There would be a ton of gquits
---
Mobility healer = druid.
---
"Best" healer = priest.
---
Most supportive healer = paladin (freedom, bop, HoJ etc).
---
Shaman idk, they are supportive and offensive (totems, purge, frost shock, earth shock).
---
I think that is how I would describe them, what is most fun depends on the player.
---
He was dead weight. Any warlock can give out healthstones/soulstones and spam shadowbolt.
---
You should have gkicked
---
wont work with a debuff slot of 16 and you got 40 warlocks
---
Zug zug!
---
You didn't invalidate anything, lmfao.  If a player is thinking about what layer they are in, that harms immersion, period.  It harms immersion just like additional superfluous UI can.  The player might not even realize it.  It's subtle.  Immersion is a collection of sometimes very subtle experiences.
---
I could defend any point I've listed, unless it's something I've said is not definite.
---
Thanks for the work you put into this! I must say Im so happy that Classic WoW is coming soon and there wont be million mounts. Only very few very rare mounts that will really turn heads if you get one of them.
---
Guess it's just you and me man.
---
Yeah.. honestly I prefer to play melee , but only with the old damage text.
---
I tried to play a melee class on retail after the switch was made and it was way less enjoyable. It's the small things that make a difference. Addons have never been able to emulate it properly.
---
PVE wise they’re all pretty boring since you’re mostly staring at health bars and cleansing. 
---
PVP wise is another ballgame though. I really enjoyed being a Resto shaman. You can be annoying with earth shocks, but if someone gets low you can always Nature’s Swiftness a chain lightning!
---
Nope, and its one of the reasons I am pro-layering. I hope to avoid needing transfers at all.
---
It is worth it. Takes an extra hour or so initially but saves you tons of time in the long run. You also end up leveling tailoring to a point where bags aren't much of a further reach. Bags + Low level wands on a fresh server are good things to be able to make.
---
Hopefully they announce when they make their characters early so we can avoid them.
---
Corpse run?
---
When I did that quest on the stress test I had about a 33% or so drop rate. Wasn't that bad. Did they change it in 1.12?
---
lol
---
I've actually decided not to use any quest addons. So I have to pay attention to the quest text, or ask someone in game if I can't find Mankriks wife. 
---
"She's at the end of wailing caverns we just need 1 more, join us!"   
---
They were some good people, liars but still good people.
---
I don't see how that has anything to do with AI yet? I see what you're saying that I can hamstring him at the same range of my auto attack range. And that extra yard is really not gonna do that much to prevent you from kiting. One problem that I see however which has somewhat to do with AI is that the mob will keep running towards you even after it has entered its added attack range from the leeway. This will absolutely make it a lot harder to react and to avoid getting hit.
---
&gt; Who hurt you?
---
Yikes sweaty lets unpack this
---
Who the hell is going to be sitting there like:
---
“Damn it, I could be leveling or exploring the world I’m in right now, but I just can’t stop thinking about what layer I’m in! Is it 2 or 3, I have to know!!!”
---
Give me a break. Every point is this type of bullshit.
---
The problems is people who think they are fun aren't always.
---
this is disheartening to hear... i absolutely loathe retail combat text, it's so lame in comparison to the way the old numbers pop
---
Well suppose i wont be seeing you at launch then :)
---
Being the rogue in the dungeon who insists on healing people with bandages is always the right choice.
---
Every guild I have ever been in that has used some form of VoIP has always had an active guild chat.  Most guilds only require it for raids and there is always a ton of people who don't want use it.
---
I think Discord is used more as a substitute for the old school guild website/forums these days, with voice chat as a secondary feature.
---
You can get refurbished laptops from Bestbuy for next to nothing that are more than powerful enough to run WoW
---
most bosses would eat through your pets faster than they could be rezzed. and 2% health back every 10 seconds isn't exactly going to replace healing. I think you'd stand a better chance against say onyxia if you heavily out geared the encounter.
---
While\*
---
Thank you. But just to understand, what do people think is the downside with leeway?
---
...and? That's one simple action. Scripting a bot which can win against players is next to impossible.
---
After my experience on the beta, Hunter is out as an option for me. This leaves me with either going Warlock or Warrior (Alliance). My question is how do Warlocks handle melee in pvp? They don't seem very mobile, do they just stand there, sacrifice void, and try to out dps whatever? I know WotF will be an inconvenience, but not enough to stop me from playing a class entirely. Also, having little loot competition in a very gear sparse raid environment is a huge plus.
---
xD
---
Wait, what? Fishing as a form of speedrun?
---
Psst, let them level first aid with their clothes.
---
Privat servers uses dynamic respawn, so essentially you can just stand on one spot and kill the quest mob over and over. That won't be the case on launch. 
---
I will first try out questing, if it's to much competition, I will switch over to exploration leveling.
---
Dwarfs/gnomes also have a great route for exploration leveling.
---
Night elfs will take slightly longer.
---
I agree with what you say apart from if we can melee then so can they, the issue with that is their Mortal Strike hits a lot fucking harder than my Raptor Strike. Yes I can wing clip but they can also hamstring. 
---
After consideration I'm not worried, I'm more concerned about FD not working when in pve.
---
Staaaaaaan!
---
That's one of the things I love about the game, a true RPG feature imo. Retail wow with auto sort/clean and gold icons on items to vendor... the game just does all the work for you.
---
well thanks for the insight of why this might not be realistic. 
---
Maybe just send in a group of 5 pets at a time and rotate them that way
---
Honest question: don't you want to slightly overlevel them anyway, because they'll hit less and you'll spend less on downtime?
---
&gt; Also, voice chat was required to be in a serious raiding guild in vanilla. Having a ventrilo was the sign of a good guild while teamspeak usually meant a more casual guild. 
---
being able to speak or just having the software ? I don't remember any guild that needed all the members to have a mic. Usualy only the raid leaders and tanks were talking, everybody else was using text chat
---
How is it now? I stopped playing pretty much right after it went free to play.
---
Question for other Priests with info of vanilla pvp servers. I’m going to be rolling a troll and doing a lot in shadow spec, is it worth moving points into blackout for the shadowguard stun or should I just stick to the typical talent set?
---
Same. I go from salivating about thinking about leveling my Warrior to shrugging and making a sad face and considering leveling a Mage instead. 
---
Back when they switched it on retail and I hadn't played the game for years and at one point a friend gave me a month of free gametime to try out a new XP. It's a huge difference, and made the game feel awkward and wrong in some kind of subtlely specific way.
---
Voice chat was common, but it was also common for people to just not have mics. Usually only 5 people would talk out of the 40.
---
The alternating thing is for mix/maxers, for regular people it's doesn't matter.
---
With good RNG you can put 2 points into spirit tap and have it up 60-80% of the time, so you can reach level 20 like... half an hour faster? Maybe an hour? I 'unno. If you prefer 5/5 wands first go for it.
---
Those 5 pets will last no more than 5 to 10 seconds and require twice that to revive.
---
Yes. The only all class in one raid I’ve ever seen work is Warrior.
---
It's still a grind, but you can sap, have more oh shit buttons, you can sneak around to objectives... I have a major case of alt-itis, but I feel like everyone should have one sneak-capable class.
---
You started with positivity, then said minus the drama, then started some Blizz drama. Interesting.
---
33 here (was 18 when the game came out)
---
I played on the Horde starting on server launch (bought collector’s ed, couldn’t get into beta test). I used to be in hardcore raiding.
---
I may come back just to remember what it was like. I miss when I was in college and I started playing AV after class, played it ALL day, went to bed at like 3am, only to que up for the same BG the next morning.
---
After seeing ashbringer I would really like to see corrupted ashbringer now
---
I gotta pick up another PS4 controller, then its DoS2 time with the fiancee on couch co-op.
---
Very good decision!  :)
---
People messing with you is part of the fun.
---
I’m not in the market for a new CPU, but if I was, I wouldn’t base my decision on one that isn’t launched yet and has no confirmed performance benchmarks.
---
I could only get 5 days :(
---
Better than nothing though!
---
"Lets make up crazy doomsday scenarios and piss and moan!"
---
Which kinda makes the fact that there was no gouge, blind, kidney shot or vanish pathetic.
---
Hope all the PvE server bashing people are ready.
---
I'll be honest with you. Unless it's for a pertinent purpose in game... people will just be using discords instead.
---
Assumed fact, and will happen no doubt.
---
...,based on what? Your assumption in this post?
---
Huntards will switch and re-roll.
---
Hunters will obtain Rhok'delar.
---
A good hunter is scary in PVP and insanely useful in PVE even with the current issues and bugs and I for one will continue to call myself a dedicated MM hunter. Shout out to the other true Hunters out there, ya'll the real MVP's!
---
/train
---
Hmm i didnt see that before. I guess they already changed their mind of multi-language servers in EU, so they could probably add the rp-pvp stuff. I just want them to focus on game play issues which affects everyone.
---
The Druid class quest chest from ZG. I think it requires revered with them plus the aegis.
---
Oh that was aimed at me in a thread earlier, haha it's nice to see people are memeing.
---
Doesn't help for community stability when you have a huge grey area due to different blizzard rep's saying different things.
---
It didn't cause inflation (this change has been used on vanilla servers for years)
---
It actually takes away more money from the economy because people use it much more often
---
There were more cliques in 40 man raids and some had their own private vent channels they used while raiding, or chat rooms, and then there was the vocal clique who basically ran the raid.  Everyone else just did what they were told.
---
I may not understand subtlety but I do understand adding superfluous shit on your list of layering cons in order to bloat the list to make your cries about how bad it is seem more legitimate. That fortunately for me is not exactly subtle, otherwise I probably wouldn't have caught it.
---
Lok'tar, friend.
---
Well, gotta go. It's almost to release now.
---
Oh shit, she's kickin me out, how am I supposed to play classic now??
---
ye I guess the level up notifications will be nice :D
---
I'll consider doing both guild and friends list
---
So, your argument for why Shaman aren't OP is that if you have a non-orc shaman a rogue can kill them over 50% of the time if everything goes perfectly and he uses every cool down?
---
Also, as we all know, mages have 1 class in classic that are really bad vs in 1v1 and that's warlocks.
---
I was lucky enough to get Finkles and then later to get the pristine hide of the beast. It's been a while but I'm fairly sure I just got it because I was the skinner and no one cared. I don't recall it being an issue at the time, but as with most things it's better to establish your rules/intentions up front.
---
Really? I thought it came under the same thing with the trigger zone being smaller than the actually melee range they need to be at to attack you?
---
This is even worse than the usual layering post.
---
38, married, two kids, employed....and on the front seat on the hype train.
---
Ill never regret rolling healer (priest) in vanilla as it meant i saw every raid back then.
---
I wasnt even 60 a long time before i was invited to a raiding guild.
---
Its a great feeling of keeping raid alive, especially the main tank to secure a successfull boss kill.
---
PVP'ed a bit aswell to get high rank, rolled with a premade and felt unbeatable. 
---
Also i remember AVs being awesome as you really could make a difference it felt as a healer in mass groups.
---
Farmed gold on alt so my priest wouldnt have a respec, otherwise as my priest got more and more geared my alt would get more time to raid aswell.
---
Life was good as a healer but being dependent on others so much though wasnt so great and why i wont be rolling a healer this time around.
---
I say let people buy into them being broken. The less the merrier for me 😁
---
&gt; Caster dps gear is wasted on them.
---
Just to jump in here, but I think this depends entirely on what or who is getting the gear. I'd rather gear up a smart Boomkin player than an awful Mage/Lock. You know the ones that constantly reposition themselves or use the wrong abilities?
---
&gt; Post all the guides you want on warriors and mages and whatever class as long as it is their best raid spec and encourage people to play shit that will be in demand so they have a better time in game. 
---
This seems to be a difficult thing for you to grasp, so I've noticed. You keep saying "shit that will be in demand". You know who is in demand 100% of the time? Reliable, friendly players. If you're looking for a hardcore progression guild with 39 other similarly-minded players, then clearly picking the optimal specs per class is important. 
---
But if you're looking to just play the goddamn game because you realize that "Molten Core progression" is verbiage uttered 15 years ago when people had no understanding of the game at the time and these days you can clear MC with a ragtag group of people provided at least 15 of them are properly specced, then play Boomkin or Arcane or Ret or whatever the hell you want, since you probably are entirely aware that these specs don't shine, but are fun to play.
---
Couples who raided together.
---
good observation
---
I'm stoked that I'll be out of town the first weekend and then am taking 10 days off for a trip on week 3. Thanks Blizz
---
Horde vs Alliance questions!
---
My main reason for wanting to play alliance is that I like their cities and settlements better. Horde gives me the impression that i'll be dealing with lots of spiky meanness and undead gore if i play on their faction. But i want to play a shaman. So I guess my question is, do horde zones get anything even close to the high fantasy "renaissance faire" vibe of alliance zones?
---
Yes, both of them, on two different servers.
---
With a priest you have all the tools. Big heal, small heal, fast heal, aoe heal, heal over time, shield , remove debuff, stam buff. 
---
Every other class are hybrids, most will only use one spell to heal.
---
I never said I wasn't
---
Of course not and this wasn’t the point I’m making but I would agree with him specifically with the points that private servers had a better implementation of batching and leeway. 
---
Perhaps it wasn’t the most blizzlike but shorter batch windows felt much better and resulted in Much healthier pvp gameplay in my opinion: you couldn’t kick someone before they start casting and have that interrupt them, you couldn’t use any sort of movement increasing effect and run through blizzard or a trap etc... and when playing on low ms the current beta leeway seems comically large. I understand the need for leeway in 2006 with many people playing on high ms, and I understand that some people want it to stay the same for authenticity’s sake, but personally I prefer the private server implementation of these 2 features.
---
Martyrdom is mandatory in pvp for both disc and shadow priests. Keep in mind you only have pushback reduction on heals, so anytime a rogue or hunter+pet is on you need the talent to cast mind blast, mind flay, mana burn etc. It also gives +20% chance to resist interrupts like kicks. You can still get imp fort. and imp pw:s.
---
Thankfully that sort of thing isn't an issue in classic since no arena and no ability to alter spec on the fly.
---
I really hope they fix this, its actually incredibly immersion breaking in a weird way. Constantly being reminded of BFA(plus the numbers just look stupid imo)
---
With meme specs its the only guilds you'll get into.
---
Choosing a server because of the streamer has got to be the lamest thing anyone could do.
---
Martyrdom is amazing don’t underestimate it.
---
I would be out after TBC.
---
I don't know I don't work at Blizzard. That's just what they said.
---
You are incorrect, it cannot be modified, stop spouting nonsense
---
the feign death and trap is the only important bug that either makes or kills hunter for pvp
---
What are you talking about, old Orgrimmar was amazing.
---
Priest was the first class I played back in Classic. I never specced into spirit tab or Imp. Wand, but made it to 60 anyways (took some time, BWL was already Out by that time). Oh and I never bought water...
---
Not really a question, just saying in 2004 WE knew nothing...
---
Same. First time I've tried it. Level 4 currently and clueless.
---
This was a time when 15 year olds could possess some manner of discipline, and could even learn to work with others without feeling the need to call people the N word.
---
I’m a holy Paladin 
---
I log in and get a few whispers from friends to do various things, usually world pvp or BGs. The first thing I do is find a mage for some water and then go off and do whatever I feel like out of my options. 
---
If I’m low on gold it’s strat live runs, or I stand on IF bridge and yell my enchanting spam. 
---
A lot of times I’ll get whispers from people running stuff I don’t need like UBRS / scholo or whatever and if I’m bored and I like the person or guild they’re in I’ll happily help out. Just last night I ran UBRS because a tank I like asked, and he’s a good tank so I knew it’d be an easy run. 
---
Pvp on a Paladin is really fun, I can do a lot and I know the other team sees me and instantly communicates that I should be prio. I look for shamans, mages, and warlocks to keep away from while making sure the squad has their BOP or freedom. 
---
I don’t rank but I’m currently rank 9 but I hate AV as a healer so I can’t really get past this spot. 
---
My favorite activity is helping lowbies so if there’s nothing going on I’ll run to the more dangerous low level areas(lvl5-20 caves, bosses like Hogger, ect) and just hang out and keep them all healed up and stuff. I’ll even do this for the horde, sometimes I roll over to that UD spot in the north west of TG with the named guys and power level random horde who wave at me. 
---
I’m also one of the main redridge defenders, so I’ll always go do a few rounds there and smash the rogues or whoever and it’s a fun game of cat and mouse.
---
Life at 60:  Everyone
---
Doing loops and jumping around in a major city, bored at noon, because the raid is 6 hours away.  While spamming "X LFG", to try and do a dungeon or two.
---
Did you go through one in vanilla? I did and they are bad. A lot more bad then you let on.
---
It only flags you automatically in cities.
---
I totally see your point. They are significantly more challenging in vanilla, and very repetitive with mob after mob. Although what’s your plan for gearing up? Farm and buy it all? PvP?
---
from pservers, shamans stack well with gear and at t2 or t3, they can delete people in ele
---
enhance is viable too for pvp
---
* Priest &amp; Shaman  
---
* Shaman was forced into resto spec for raids  
---

Thanks! I was thinking priest might be good, I could make truefaith vestments and buy a hide of the wild. If I can get pulled into a raid to grab an eye of divinity for Benediction at some point I’ll be in heaven.
---
I don't have beta so I can't test it, but top 50 people seems like a lot. Is there an option to change the amount of players it tracks? Personally, I think seeing the top 5 or 10 would be perfect. Anything above 10 is way too many for me
---
No, this seems to be another realm. Mine was "Das Syndikat".
---
I've leveled 3 priests.  2 on vanilla, 1 on private.  I've tried a lot of different specs.  I would recommend waiting on blackout until nearly level cap.  
---
To be clear Blackout is amazing, but legit nearly every talent in shadow is very strong.  It is the sort of tree that you want to put 40+pts into and then you realize lower disc helps with all of the weaknesses of shadow(mana and control resist).  
---
While blackout is strong, for purely leveling purposes, point for point anything that increases your damage or buffs your mana efficiency has to take priority.  Blackout is more of a control or damage taken reduction talent.  Something that baseline shadow has in spades, and is not really needed for leveling.  
---
That being said, as troll, blackout is likely quite fun.  I could see myself respeccing to blackout if I got caught up in the zerg and was having a lot of unavoidable same level pvp.  I would just have Plan A being, to level with the fastest leveling spec so I get to max level before there are waves of bored level 60 gankers.
---
What I find sad is your partisan obsession with layering being the bee's knees.  You are like someone on a radical political party- EVERYTHING the other side does must be wrong.  I am sure your response list will be filled with misunderstandings, exaggerations, straw men, minimalizations etc, but I'll read it anyways.
---
Haha. Blockchain levelling addon. Love it!
---
do you have to pay to play on private servers? Is there any downside?
---
I'm so hyped waiting to play Classic, but if there's a reasonable facsimile  out there right now, i'm sorta wondering why I'm here reading a forum instead of playing.
---
Thank you, finally some brained addition to this painful discussion. Plus as for the trap discussion, leeway is disabled when you stand still, which means no one is gonna hit you over a trap, you can just stand still to disable leeway and force them onto the trap or back out and slow them, so all these people jumping ship and rerolling are a big fat joke
---
Oh, I wouldn't bother to argue about this issue anymore, it's been done to death already. So I'm not arguing, I'm here to poke fun at the silliness.
---
I've been playing the Divinity: Original Sin series again. If you haven't tried it i'd highly suggest checking it out, Especially if you're dating/married to someone who's also taking a break from WoW. It has local co-op, and the games actually play better with another player by your side. If you play Divinity: OS 2, you can do 2 players local co-op, or up to 4 players online. It also has more races to choose from, more class customization, multiple storylines (so amazing replayability), and it has a game creator which if you've ever played or (especially) DM'd a D&amp;D game, you will thoroughly enjoy. I seriously can't speak more highly of this series, it's great.
---
Is it a cosmetic preference that has you considering Undead Warrior? Outside of cosmetics, they’re the worst of the four Horde races for Warrior.
---
Understandable. I didn’t mind it since as a dps on a mid pop server it helped more than hurt at first.
---
I have actually had this exact situation come up in a dream before. I'm sorry you had to live through this hell in real life.
---
Yes, Mind Flay is mediocre at best for leveling, but it is a nice utility in pvp and some pve situations. Imo Imp. SW:P is good for leveling.
---
PvP: everyone wants you.
---
PvE: everyone needs a healer
---
Gold farming: do reserve runs with a geared tank for gold, pick up a gathering profession or learn how to make gold by investing in Ah/world chat items
---
You're correct, poorly articulated on my part.
---
How many mobs do you need to be kiting to reach the breakpoint where dpm or xp/hr is better aoe kiting?
---
Fucking shimmering flats quests... 
---
Also yes, people shitting on you for running a Paladin or Druid or whatever. We don’t all play to min max. Why just read the BiS / rotation off a sheet, a lot more fun to actually think about it in my opinion.
---
The race to 60 is just an indicator of free time and following guides made over a decade ago, it's nothing to worry about "falling behind" on.
---
Of course - for me the server issue affects me and my community so of course I have to fight for clarity.
---
Hunter, Warlock, or Mage? Trying to be a good ranged turret in AV but will also be raiding.
---
Currently leaning hunter for the leveling and easier gearing in pve as well as rhok'delar. Gold farming is nice too.
---
Warlocks always look like a fun face-melting alternative hunter (a bit later on though) that also have a good time leveling.
---
And mage seems like a warlock with a better quality of life! Though harder to pvp with.
---
It doesn't continue at 60 to the same degree.  
---
Ele shamans specifically have burst, great burst.   
---
If you have the Natural Alignment Crystal and a spellpower trinket it can be disgusting, but they don't have the best mana efficiency especially with chain lightning.  
---
It's alltogether just awful practise to ever make a decision about how good a class is based on 1v1 tournaments. It's unlikely a warrior would ever win a 1v1 tournament at any level bracket, but you'd be insane to suggest warriors aren't incredibly strong in PvP, for example.
---
&gt; and you can only use instant abilities whial moving.
---
Even if you didn't misspell, you'd be way wrong here.. lul
---
Since when you can **only** use instant abilities while moving? I know that classic was very many years ago, but I remember being able to use instant abilities while not moving. I'm not convinced that my memory is failing me here..
---
They're very gear dependant in any spec outside of Resto.
---
Once you get some T2 pieces and maybe some AQ/ZG pieces you will be able to do a lot more with them in terms of Elemental/Enchancement spec in PVP.
---
Yes! There’s even a mobile version. I can’t remember exactly what it’s called but it starts with C and ends with alculator.
---
Undead is the worst race choice for a warrior so if you really want one of these two and be undead, go for priest.
---
Judging by the bags you have you were playing on a private server.  Private servers are much harder than classic is.  On the stress test I felt like things were real easy on a rogue the only problem was the shortage of mobs.
---
&gt;Seems that layering doesnt really fix any problem
---
Trolling this hard should be bannable
---
On the contrary, I was 14 and somehow I was able to put that combo together all on my own.
---
I'm late to the party, but I'm gonna mod-abuse this and [link to a resource/experiment I ran a couple weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/?)
---
Long-story short, yes, a modern i5 and a GTX 1660 6GB would handle Classic very well and should be sticking you pretty solidly in 60 FPS raid environment even at max settings.
---
Because we know from experience.
---
This idea has been used on vanilla servers so we know what the results will be.
---
I disagree man. I'm leveling a warr on a pserver (the newest one, you know which), and I'm really surprised at how easy it is. 1-10 sucked ass as a human - no 2hers available until you get training at 10... and I swear you could get 2h sword training in vanilla sub level 10. If not then wtf is the point of lvl 5 "training swords". After 10 though, it's been a breeze. Once you get that first sweet 2her, it's all downhill.
---
The thing with warriors is you have to think outside the box.  Get a very slow 2her, charge, hamstring, kite for 3-4s (however long your swing is), switch directions and hit, add rend if it's optimal to do so, kite for 3-4s, switch directions again and hit. Mob dies. Hell once I got Smite's Hammer, I could one shot green level mobs with a good HS crit. I'm at 21 now, blowing through deadmines, 2h tanking the majority of it. Between Cleave and Tclap I'm easily #1 dps. 
---
Another thing - group pulling. We don't have CC, so we really have no choice but to shoot a mob with ranged and kite until the other mobs run away. Keep shooting the mob you want to kill occasionally so it sticks on you, while the other mobs reset.
---
&gt;It was basically understood that if you aren’t one of the raid leaders, you don’t talk in voice unless addressed or outside of down time.
---
The 2 guilds I was in would only be quiet during boss fights, particularly new ones that required focus and for the raid leaders to organize. 
---
If we were doing trash though we'd crack jokes and talk about movies or current events (non-politics) and it really helped build comradery.
---
OP:   
---
&gt;Balance Druid's stereotype which has carried through to today has been the notion that they run out of mana exceedingly fast, being coined "OOMkin". This is a verifiably false statement with the capability of being able to last nearly 5-minutes in the current state of the game.  
---
Also OP:  
---
&gt;Innervate is yours in this day of age, not anyone else's.   
---
Well? Which one is it? Do balance druids have infinite mana or do they need to rob the healers of an innervate?
---
Enhance is viable for hoping you get a windfury crit before you get CC’d all over the place and ultimately die.
---
Jezz, you can't use it while in combat. Blizzard, puts you in combat; if you have a dot on it means you are in combat; the thing with being knocked out a moment later makes no sense to me.
---
I think some people had a very bad experience and some people it wasn't bad at all, and in some cases good.  I am not trying to minimize your bad experience.
---
It's hard for me to accurately talk about server merges being awful because like I said, in my experience they weren't bad.
---
What, specifically, was bad about the server merge you experienced?
---
Is there any way you can think of to merge servers that would avoid such things?
---
I wish someone could put Alicia's Poem to music:
---
*Do not stand at my grave and weep,
---
I am not there, I do not sleep.
---
I am in a thousand winds that blow,
---
across Northrend’s bright and shining snow.
---
I am the gentle showers of rain,
---
on Westfall’s fields of golden grain.
---
I am in the morning hush,
---
of Stranglethorn’s jungle, green and lush.
---
I am in the drums loud and grand,
---
the thunderous hooves across Nagrand.
---
I am the stars warmly gleaming,
---
over Darnassus softly dreaming.
---
I am in the birds that sing,
---
I am in each lovely thing.
---
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
---
I am not there. I do not die.*
---
Can you explain? Wouldn’t you have the same exact hot chance with your MH and then just added meager dps from your OH?
---
That's why they have cake knives, so you can cut the top off if it is uneven.  The real problem is if it sinks in the middle, and you have to fill it with frosting.
---
Yes strat living side is great for gold farming if you have a nice group. 
---
Pretty much you go into the back door, do unforgiven, and then head to living side from there. The point is righteous orbs which on pservers range from 25g-40g per orb and they are used for Crusader and healing power enchants. You can usually get 3-5 per run and most people do round robin on them so everyone can get one. Most the time the tank will reserve the first one because tanking sucks and their repairs also suck. Once BWL comes out if me and a warrior are geared we can 2 man the whole thing and make insane gold per hour. 
---
This farm also nets you a lot of runecloth which sells really well, and various blue items that can be disenchanted for large brilliant shards
---
Alright, let's do this. This will be a response to every layering con and cluster pro on this thread.
---
As a side note, layering sucks and I look forward to when it will be removed. But it is the best temporary solution to a temporary problem.
---
Cons of layering:
---
1. Reduces immersion by having people appear and disappear in front of you as they change layers.
---
   1. You mean like people accepting a summon? Or logging out? Or disconnecting? This happens all the time, and with the cooldown on swapping layers it will not be that frequent. Most people will get to a layer and stay there the entire time they are on.
---
2. Reduces immersion by adding a non-world aspect of the game that is distracting to players. When you are thinking about which layer you're in, you're not immersed in the world.
---
   1. Already refuted this one as it is literally the most bullshit thing I've ever read. 
---
3. Harms immersion by destroying cohesion. It's like stepping out of your office to use the restroom and when you come back in everyone has been replaced with a different person.
---
   1. This is a faulty metaphor. It assumes that you are going to know EVERY PERSON around you in the world and that EVERY PERSON is going to swap to a new layer in a matter of minutes, and that this will happen CONSTANTLY. Most people will swap layers at most one time in a session. As described above, this would happen anyway without layering as the people around you are constantly changing anyway. More on this later.
---
4. You are much less likely to run into players on a recurring basis, in some cases you will *never* run into players you normally would have had multiple interactions with.
---
   1. What do you mean normally would have had multiple interactions with? If there were no layers, there would be so many people you would be interacting with .01% of the people in any area anyway. With layers or without, this doesn't change. Anyone you will have multiple interactions with you will end up friending and, guess what, probably having more interactions with. Additionally, the layers make up one community anyway. It's all one server. Anyone you interact with you will have the chance to later.
---
5. Unknown total size of total server/ combined layers... What is Blizzards goal for server size pre-layer?
---
   1. You have an unknown listed as a con. The fact that it is unknown actually makes that impossible. It could just as likely be a positive thing.
---
6. Unknown ramifications of large AH pool on economy (You have 10k+ people sharing AH possibly). This is not guaranteed to be bad.
---
   1. You refute your own point. Larger AH pool is spread across a larger population. This becomes irrelevant.
---
7. Immersion hurt by seeing 4× the amount of rare items on AH (4 layers example). Where you might normally see 1-2 Kang the Decapitators listed, now you'll see 4-8. This makes unique items seem less rare and makes it feel gamey.
---
   1. There is no way to know if this is the result of layering or multiple people just getting lucky. There are always going to be multiple rare items on an AH, sometimes more sometimes less. Multiple items is just part of an MMO experience and should have no effect on immersion.
---
8. Possible abuse in combat.
---
   1. This is barely even a complete thought. How could it be abused in combat? There is no point to be made here.
---
9. Possible abuse for economic gain.
---
   1. Once again, how? The cooldown is going to pretty well remove any possibility of this being at thing.
---
10. This one is IMO perhaps the most important. Lack of cohesive player body makes it less likely to form relationships, both friendships and rivalries. Forming friendships and rivalries by chance encounters is one of the most memorable parts of WoW, but also quite rare. With layering it's almost impossible to do. Imagine some of your own run-ins with players that allowed you to form rivalries/friendships. Now imagine there were 3 layers so 2/3 of those chance run-ins never happened. Would you still have formed the same relationship? Not likely. With layers, everyone you meet is just another rando, since you will likely never see them again, because the odds you're on at the same time+place are slim, but same time+place+layer are nil
---
   1. Everyone is not another rando, it's all one server community. You may fail to have 2/3 chance run ins with certain people, but instead you will have them with 2/3 other people. People that will ultimately be on your server, meaning when layers are removed you have just as much of a chance of running into them again. It is still a cohesive body, just across layers temporarily.  Your point would only be valid if instead of the 2/3 chance run ins, you just saw 0 people, which will not be the case.
---
11. If Blizzard underestimates the player decline, they will still have to do server merges.with name changes.
---
   1. If they underestimate player decline they will have to do this anyway, even if layers didn't exist.
---
12. If Blizzard overestimates player decline, or allows servers to fill too much you're stuck with layering indefinitely unless they break up the server.
---
   1. Do you have evidence of this? Or is this just an assumption that you have no support for. I'm guessing the latter. If they overestimate player decline they will just add new servers and give people the opportunity to move, and I'm sure allow free transfers temporarily. This would happen with or without layers.
---
13. "Overcrowding" can force players to explore the world or do something else rather than follow a straight leveling path.
---
   1. Layering is being implemented to help avoid overcrowding...how is this a con of layering? Additionally, the con is it could "force players to explore the world or do something outside of a straight leveling path." Isn't that why most of the people are here anyway? 
---
14. Less overcrowding means less world pvp.
---
   1. So is there overcrowding, or not...can't be too sure since you say there is both. The layers will represent a normal server size, so the chance of world pvp is just as high.
---
15. Some people enjoy the chaos of "overcrowding" for a variety of reasons.
---
   1. Once again...is there overcrowding or not? Layers have been shown to still be chaotic, and it's a launch of a high-demand game. There will be chaos no matter what.
---
50g respecs by an infinite amount. Shouldn’t be punished if you want to PvP and raid.
---
It would still be the same, 12k players is 12k players. Even if they dont live on the same server.
---
Says you. Pretty easy to walk up to a yellow mob and lead with a backstab that does more damage than SS.
---
I hope this doesn’t get removed. It brought a smile to my face after a bad day.
---
Hey, any idea how we could build this 1 button leveling macro in classic?
---
1 press = Get target, Mark target if not marked, send pet, begin autoshot (but never cancel autoshot)
---
2 press = Serpent sting if not already
---
3 press = Arcane shot
---
More presses = Arcane shot when off CD and Serpent sting if it runs out.
---
/script if GetUnitName("target")==nil then TargetNearestEnemy() end
---
/run if not buffed("Hunter's Mark",'target') then cast("Hunter's Mark");end
---
/script if not IsAutoRepeatAction(62) then CastSpellByName("Auto Shot"); end
---
/script PetAttack()
---
/run if not buffed("Serpent Sting",'target') then cast("Serpent Sting");end
---
If you're only ever fighting mobs and players at your level or lower, you only need the 4%, but since that scenario is so unlikely, you want all 3 points.
---
i get that now. And really, anything that will make classic a success is a win for us all.
---
In a strictly pvp setting, priests typically default to flash of light.  Improved healing is an almost purely pve talent.  
---
I found it hard to judge the value of disc vrs holy when I played my mage in higher end pvp.  All the priests were disc or shadow.  The one or two holy priests were either really bad at pvp and were brough along becuase of numers, and/or trying to pvp in their low stam high +healing pve gear.  They were so easy to kill that the spirit of redemptions were more comical then effective.  
---
I then rerolled back to priest with a pvp focus.  I tried a lot of different specs, mostly played disc, but I did do holy focus pvp build to see it out.  Spirit of redemption sounds good, but in wpvp and WSG fights are typically far too mobile for it to be good.  AB I think it has a little bit of potential for turtling flags.  
---
In terms of a macro to cancel it as fast as possible, I made my mount macro back in the day /cancelaura spirit of redemption /use black war kodo or whatever it was so I could break it as soon as possible.  I made the macro after misclicking to remove it right as some other buff faded and accidentally clicked off a soulstone :(.  
---
Overall I disliked holy in pvp.  The 10% healing bonus from spiritual healing and the spell power from spirtiual guidance is quite nice, but you can't wear enough spirit in pvp to make it really meaningful.  The 10% mana from disc is almost as good, espiecally when you are spending more of your mana on utility then healing frequently.  Deep disc to PI is a great way to break a flag carrier or cap a base.  Disc and then shadow to silence is maybe my favorite, you still heal 90% as good as anyone else, but gain a lot of control that can swing fights for your team.  
---
In pve SoR is considered a waste of a talent point for progression fights.  Disc and holy are filled with talents that are too good and not enough points to get them all.  Standard pve spec is:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5012301305001-025051031300055
---
I would be putting points into imp renew, healing focus, or imp poh before I put one into spirit of redemption.
---
&gt; I will happily roll on a RPPvP server, though, because of the quantity of actual names is higher.
---
That is actually very appealing. Although I'm still not sure I could raid on an RP server. Seems like boss fight explanations would be pretty awful, second only to the rogue with the chaotic bitch alignment who thought running into whelps would be a nice dramatic crescendo.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, this helps a lot! As I never priested back then it’s hard for me to tell how much worth blackout has compared to other talents while leveling. Originally I was going to pick it up in the 20’s-30’s but I’ll hold off then like you suggested. I’m looking forward to playing around with blackout later for pvp though, I like having some extra defense as a caster.
---
Nope, that's why I asked.
---
Is this some new client limitation? You used to be able to modify combat text how you liked. Like the scrolling combat text was just an addon and not part of the client.
---
I planned on going horde anyway and just farming rep for Raptors, 
---
The icing on the cake would of been getting a tiger mount on horde. 
---
I would have the best of both worlds at that point! Haha
---
Enhancement shaman is so awesome when windufurry procs often. And it's completely terrible when it doesn't. Played enha on Private server few years ago. Sometimes there were no wf procs for two mobs in a while and then the dmg was really low
---
7000k would be 7 million. This isn't retail ;D
---
Best layering post of the day. Have an upvote.
---
If TPS is a issue in your raid then the raid needs to be utilizing Bear or an autist Fury Warrior.
---
I played 24 hours straight on BFA launch and didn’t see any message.
---
Lol I still think every guild needs a mascot boomkin. 
---
Also gnome druids should be added 😍
---
and we played on garbage PCs with 15 fps lol
---
You did nothing to address them.  Far small exploits have been fixed.   There's nothing in the history of wow as broken as world buff stacking.  If that isn't an exploit, then nothing is.
---
Let that douche bag Nelf get the opener on my dwarf rogue, I can stoneform his bleeds and reopen on his bitch ass. Oh if he tries to blind me, stoneform.
---
Nah, it's very easy i've done it a lot. You have to think of it on probability. Even though the undead is specifically pinned against that wall, he has 180 degrees of guesswork, and then even if he glimps you, he then has a small radius of guesswork in that area in which you have stealth and sprint and the advantage of watching him.
---
This is how you can easily escape as a druid, all classes kinda have some advantage or disadvantage. Depending on the level of course, mages are near impossible once 30. mounting doesn't share a GCD so you can blink/mount in any direction
---
&gt; they'll still use it to complain about not enough content when they speed run to 60.
---
I've speedrun since Vanilla. I've always been among the first to level cap, I've never seen this shit that people always bring up.
---
We got shit to do at 60, we'll be busy.
---
Does this mean that Tauren hunters have an advantage?
---
But we were all into the same "world"
---
The people involved in the mergers would have to be completely different.
---
Sure merging itself can be easy but it’s really about the people involved and their perceptions. Didn’t help that the people coming over had gear that my server hadn’t seen yet as no one had downed a raid boss yet. Most of it was an extreme elitist attitude that I hadn’t and haven’t experience in gaming since.
---
For me, I hate this thread because the sub feels like 90% of the players are playing PVP servers. In fact less than 50% of the players are rolling to PVP servers and probably a handful of them rolls RPPVP servers. I don't give a fuck whether they will get their RPPVP server or not, but stop fucking advertising how it's not possible to experience the whole game if you are rolling PVE.
---
Not downvoting the Thread tho. You can have your meaningless conversations in this bubble all day long.
---
I leveled a Shaman with Corpsemaker and wind fury weapon and it was not even close to shit. I routinely 1 shot mobs from level 30 to 40. Anyone who says this is full of it. Mathematically it may be better to go Rockbiter but only slightly. It is rare to fight any equal level mob and not get a WF proc.
---
Most pallies at 60 will be holy though, either way priest should win a 1v1 vs pala but considering neither class has an interrupt mana burn is a great way to shut the class down.
---
Dwarf and gnome rogues &gt;human and Nelf
---
Titan xp with titan bar
---
&gt;  xpPerHourThisSession = this.sessionXP / sessionTime * 3600;
---
The privileged good spec can respect whenever they want, because farming gold is easy for them.  Healers are the only ones that are limited by respect cost.
---
You can only modify the kind of scrolling combat text that appears on your screen in a fixed position, not the floating text that pops up at the position of the target.
---
&gt; This isn't retail ;D 
---
Thank god!
---
Also undeads just look so much better, although that one can be subjective
---
Youb can always roll troll to be original though haha
---
Not being able to down onyxia is really really bad.  You just proved everyone's point about the meme specs.
---
Your guild will not last long and all of those "cool and fun people" will leave you for other raids that are actually clearing content.  No 40 man raid will stay together if the raiding is bad.
---
1. Streamlining leveling might not be a good thing and cause players to get bored. If grinding is the path of least resistance, players that normally would have fun doing other things might stick with it and wind up hating it.
---
   1. How does layering influence this at all? Starting zones will be crazy - some opt to quest, some opt to grind. It is 100% the player's choice. If they make a choice they don't like that they aren't forced to make, how is that the system's fault? 
---
2. **Possible destruction of World PvP as we know it. Even if someone can change layers once/day, that's enough to** ***significantly*** **harm worldpvp**. If I play for 1-2 hours/day, I'm probably only going to run into 1 dangerous ganker during that time period, so with layering I'll be able to spam for invites and avoid them 100% of the time. How many battles at Tarren Mill do you think there will be when people can simply avoid it and keep leveling?
---
   1. Uh oh....destruction!? Seriously? You think you are going to be able to spam general or guild or discord for invites and people will be just waiting to invite you instantly? And this will happen 100% of the time? I call total bullshit. You'll be dead before you can even do anything, or you'll be on cooldown to swap layers from killing an enemy or looting something. Additionally, you think this will happen enough to prevent entire battles at Tarren Mill? Seriously? Entire raids of people will layer swap simultaneously? Give me a break.
---
Pros of server clusters (clusters of servers share name/guild name pools in case a merge is required):
---
1. Clusters share same name pool to make merges easier.
---
   1. What the fuck even is a server cluster. I hope you don't mean a list of "layers" for a server that people select separately and actually log in to. More on that later.
---
2. Can simply keep adding servers to clusters as pop increases.
---
   1. You mean like layers? lol.
---
3. Lowered queues, since you can funnel new players to new servers via server suggestion.
---
   1. 95% of people will ignore a new server suggestion to go where their friends are. Even if you are one of the people who would want it...how would this be different than a new server with layers? Layers are being implemented to...guess what...lower queues. 
---
4. No worry about having to estimate population decline. If it declines, you have servers ready to merge. If it doesn't, you can maintain server integrity.
---
   1. You mean like...layer merging? This is not a unique "pro." What if they over-estimate clusters and the population is so low merging can't fix it? 
---
5. Maintains vanilla gameplay integrity
---
   1. What integrity do you speak of? Should we also have hour long queues and game crashes and game breaking bugs for integrity's sake? Wouldn't clusters limit the population and reduce the chaos that was vanilla? Wouldn't it stop me from seeing people I might otherwise see? Oh, and what if a cluster fills up that a friend is on before I can make a character? Or what if I'm separated from my whole guild? Guess I'm fucked.
---
I would give anything to have a replica made that looked like this. I'm okay with glass holding the emblem thing in place.
---
When you’re starting out it should be difficult.  You’ve got no fighting experience or skills developed yet, so many low-level encounters should be close to a 50/50 chance to win.  Classic WoW is meant to be a challenge - and that’s its appeal.  I stopped playing after Wrath because Blizz’s decision to balance the game across classes and make it easier to succeed reduced the value of my playing experience.  If you want someone to hold your hand, play retail.
---
&gt;Got what I wanted. Arbitrary numbers to support your point.
---
Lmfao!  Didn't you just accuse me of using a straw man?  I literally clarified and told you I was paraphrasing.  Shall I go back over your posts and find where you paraphrased and ask if you have "facts" to back it up?  How pathetic.
---
&gt;For most people, the majority of vanilla will take place at level 60. That is an obvious fact
---
Oh?  A fact? Surely this isn't an arbitrary comment and you aren't throwing out arbitrary numbers?
---
The hilarious thing is you're dead wrong. For many people, the majority of their experience will be at 60.  But not most.  According to Blizzard's own thinking, what with preparing for tourists, they figure most people will quit before reaching 60.  That throws out your comment right there as patently false.  And for those that do reach 60, for many it will take months.  Many will have multiple alts.  So you are wrong.
---
Anyways, I think we're done here.  If you're going to be so pathetic that you nitpick phrasing on a chat discussion, even after I clarify what I was saying after acknowledging criticism of my phrasing, you are not worth anyone's time.
---
If you are tanking they jump to 2nd place.
---
The benefit of 3/3 isn’t as valuable, so for single target spec you go 2/2 right away then pick up 3/3 later on once you’ve picked up the important early talents. 
---
Look up infra’s 1.13 mage guide, there’s plenty of useful info including ideal single target levelling build and the order in which you want to select each talent.
---
Having the software to listen.
---
I like how no one actually answered your question, which is valid. Now the numbers/reasoning you used are pretty ridiculous but post layering, I can see a server having 8k+ population. 
---
Blizzard could just let the server be overpopulated, or they could open new servers and allow transfers, or they could just put a cap and add queues.
---
Or they could do something else entirely. Truth is, Blizzard is expecting heavy population drop off and doesn't think that this will be a problem, and likely doesn't have anything planned at the moment but will figure something out when push comes to shove.
---
If your going down the tailoring route you need so much cloth for the profession that you don’t “need” first aid right now.  
---
It’s efficient I know as I manage to hold a The raid in ZG alive at 0 mana by bandaging the mages on batboss when two healers was DC/D.  
---
If it works it’s. Not stupid.  But compared to leveling your tailoring it’s not worth it.
---
As I note in my response - layering sucks and I look forward to it being removed, but it’s necessary temporarily.
---
Curse of Shadow, Power Infusion, Spell Vulnerability, Traces of Silithyst, Darkmoon Faire, Soul Revival, and Moonfury, i.e. 1.1\*1.2\*1.15\*1.05\*1.1\*1.1, and Moonfury before spell damage.  
---
The damage was both emulated on spreadsheet and on PTR.
---
Yes it would be awesome but using the rates from the other guy's comment, you're statistically likely to get your tiger after about 8 years assuming you raid ZG every week.  Seeing people riding around on mounts like this was an event unto itself and thats what made them special.  You shouldn't expect to have anything except racial mounts for the foreseeable future unless you get really REALLY lucky.
---
maybe more terrible than introducing tokens :)
---
agreed, they need to release as-is first to be able to claim 'the players demanded it' as a reason, but I would think they have a list and timetable of changes they want to implement to 'fix' classic.
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com/ 
---
Is what I'll use before choosing a server.
---
No they don't.
---
And yet so many people will still do it
---
How feasible is gathering when in healing spec though, am I just gonna get rekt?
---
True.  
---
But not only does the recipient need to drop then you need a ton of cloths.  
---
Silk Cloth x 38 stacks
---
Mageweave Cloth x 26 stacks
---
Runecloth x 45 stacks
---
Rugged Leather x 12 stacks
---
And i would get 2-3 extra stacks just to be safe.
---
For leveling I'd go with 3/3.  You'll likely have plenty of encounters with orange mobs.
---
At 60, for raiding you obviously want 3/3.  if you're pvp only, it depends on what hit you get from gear.

The hardcore players or people buying Chinese gold will enjoy respecs.

Most will just stay one spec hence why this change makes the game much better.
---
Same! It's an awesome game, picking between Shadowbringers and classic WoW was difficult for me but I ended up picking classic.
---
Wrong.  Shaman get hit talents in the resto tree, Nature's Guidance.

You’ll be able to run 1280x800 and at least level 3 at 60 fps

Yes and the guy wasn't talking about a literal bot but a bot assist.

It was more aimed at people who unironically use the term "carebear" against anyone who doesn't like pvp servers, but I guess some people are too slow to get that
---
r/unexpectedfactorial
---
You get a 10% bonus to your armor based on your equipped armor amount. It does not increase the armor on the items so it does not affect bear form.
---
Do some critical thinking for a minute boss. How much play time is the people quitting going to amount to?
---
Now how much will those who hit 60 and play for the multiple year long progression of classic amount to?
---
I think we know which one will be higher.
---
Even if it takes months to level, that still leaves many more months of gameplay at cap. And by that point, layering will be gone, so any future alts have a layerless experience.
---
Pretty sure you exactly understand my argument and just chose to be a smartass anyways
---
Dwarf rogues are ballers ! Fuck yeah
---
I’d be interested in seeing screenshots where the damage number shares a digit (to do an exact comparison). It also might be easier to tell how different it is if the screenshots aren’t cropped.
---
Yes thank you for your addition to the debate.
---
I'm not sure if these have been fixed since I stopped playing it a week or so ago, but the pets felt wonky. Everything was delayed and too often they would glue themselves to your side and refuse to leave regardless of what command they are set at. (I do kinda miss the bug where pets would run away with what you were pulling, it was funny.)
---
My biggest issue though was how difficult it was to gauge the deadzone. Sometimes it felt like things had to be REALLY far away to shoot them again. I remember the deadzone being big, but not THIS big.
---
Hunter was by far my favorite class in vanilla, I really want to play it again, but it's just too frustrating for me at this point. I'm sure you and others may enjoy it, but these small things are hard for me to get over.
---
You did nothing of the sort.  Your so called argument is a joke.  The difficulty that you subjectively place on the game is irrelevant as to whether or not these things are exploits.
---
I know. Im just saying that their criteria isnt consistent. The BG addon will probably be a thing tho
---
Probably not, it has a lot of +healing and very little +spell damage.
---
Would love to play Horde but I can't give up my love for Ironforge, it's just a phenomenal city!
---
"Stop! He's already OOM :((("
---
We still have the "fuck sleep at night" strategy 🤣🤣🤣
---
Damn, a male Night Elf in Plate and wielding The Big Sword? Looks fucking great, big ups.
---
Exactly.  First person to 60 is a STRONG indicator of one of the following:
---
Streamer
---
'College' student
---
Single/No family responsibilities
---
In a job/life where PTO isnt allocated for other vacations already.  (I.e. teacher during summer)
---
Not really as almost all of the pieces have +healing and no +spell damage. If you want to play balance you will need to pick up mostly cloth caster gear. 
---
alternatively the rank 10 pvp does offer some +spell damage, about 75. So if you mix that with cloth caster gear you could get an ok amount of +spell dmg and still have survivability from the pvp gear with its stamina. 
---
One of the main downsides to playing the off specs of the hybrids is that they dont have dedicated gear so it will be difficult. Most people raid as resto and pick up side pieces once the mage and warlocks are geared up. Unless you have a nice casual guild that will let you raid as balance.
---
If you could time it perfectly so that you were sending in each pet in a perfectly timed manner to taunt a tauntable boss (maybe half? of vanilla low teir raid bosses are tauntable) and keep the boss from aggroing onto a ranged hunter you may be able to keep the boss focused on pets. If more than 1 or 2 pets are on a boss at a time too many would die. So that is alot of focus for your raid to be essentially conveyor belting the pets in. Rez. Send in at the right time. Die. Rez repeat. Lot of coordination there. Plus the lack of healing so you really couldn't fight a boss that had any widespread AOE going off regularly. This is going to push your table of doable bosses pretty low.   
---
Ony MIGHT be doable if everyone is perfect, but he has alot of aoe frontal attacks to kill off pets. And if she starts to spin because pets arent taunting her from the same spot all the time she'll aoe the raid. or tailwhip.
---
Luci? adds have cleave. and the whole mind control issue. 20 yard AOE from luci. 
---
Mag frontal cone aoe. Fire spit... which will do more than 2% hp over 10 seconds with its dot. plus the fear.
---
Gehennas just too much off main target damage for your raid
---
geddon has a nasty dot plus the aoe will ruin all the pets 
---
shazz. the aggro wipe would probably be the main issue but.... maybe if well organized enough. I'll give this one a maybe. 
---
Sulf I think has too many adds to deal with and too much to manage. The adds have alot of off main target attcks. Plus heals. 
---
Magg... the imortal puppies would need pet rotations in addition to magg. Nope, no way.
---
Domo too many adds, too many aggo wipes. 
---
And rag? I just think he'd wipe the pets too fast, plus the sons would eat pets etc. You'd never be able to maintain a pet aggro rotation well enough between phases.
---
So an all hunter raid... just doesn't seem possible without AI level coordination of the pets. 
---
Try druid. That has alot more potential.
---
Simpsons did it
---
PlatinumWoW the gift that keeps on giving
---
The spell hit reduction for equal level targets is 4%, but you can never have more than 99% spell hit chance.
---
The spell hit reduction for raid bosses is 17%, but again you can never have more than 99% spell hit chance.
---
In classic you're a huge inconvenience that can easily be removed from the fight. No spell reflect, no warbringer, no intervene. No devastate for the instant spamable damage and debuff, only 50% change to dispel on shield slam, not 100%. Prot is really really close to being good, but in vanilla it falls short.
---
Honestly one of my favorite parts of being a Resto Shaman at 60 was my guild always supplying me with consumables. I barely remember having to farm gold regularly.
---
I don't think there is.  Generally the melee classes suffer against kiters and the ranged classes suffer against people they cannot disengage from.
---
hey, were recruiting for classic wow, check us out. We love for you and anyone you know to join!  https://www.reddit.com/r/wowclassicguilds/comments/c96fre/auspvp_just_that_simple_recruiting_for_classic_wow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Thats subjective, sometimes I saw some good jokes passing by. Wouldn't say it was the majority though
---
I’m kinda annoyed how people make out how difficult leveling a warrior is. My first 60 during live vanilla when I was 9 yes old was a NE warrior. If I could do it then then it isn’t some insane task now.
---
Because damage meters alone weren't providing enough real time confirmation of my inferiority.
---
Rogues at the beginning of vanilla. That shit was insane and broken.
---
The run in was one of the hardest parts of that fight.
---
I did the 60-70 grind in the last 2 weeks I’m on patch 4.3 quest, I’m hoping to start ShB content tonight or tomorrow. I’m really really excited!
---
The floaty yellow part is actually a naaru. Or at least a piece of a naaru, which are beings of pure light in the wow lore.
---
So I'd imagine it doesn't really have a physical form beyond what you see (no weight), and just floats around like all the other naaru in wow
---
Crouching loot bug.
---
This was my experience too, I was 18 and raiding in naxx. BC was when the kids got rowdy :p
---
Raid warlocks aren't specced for dots because the debuff slots are better used for the rest of the raid rather than 1 person getting a bit of extra dps. If you do a raid of 40 locks, then there will certainly be locks specced into dots in order to use those debuff slots
---
I would argue that they do have something planned but there is no reason to tell us.
---
I was trying to feel inclusive towards those that prefer the term PvP-RP. What you say is a fair statement however.
---
Troll for R A C E A E S T H E T I C S
---
&gt;For many people, the majority of their experience will be at 60. But not most
---
&gt;How much play time is the people quitting going to amount to?
---
You said most people.  So it doesn't matter how much the person plays, only that they do.  And you aren't allowed to clarify since you have set the precedent that if you need to clarify you're wrong by default.  Isn't that annoying?
---
Seriously though, I understand what you are saying obviously.  Level 60 will be a big chunk of play for A LOT of people.  But I think you are way overestimating.  Now let me clarify so you don't lose your mind- I am going off of memory and don't have a list of Blizzard approved facts, but: From what I understand in original vanilla less than 1% of players completed high end raids. That changed drastically when TBC came out, of course.
---
There will be a MUCH higher % hitting 60 now than in vanilla, I think.  That doesn't mean 1-59 experience should suffer on account of that, since for a lot of players that will be a very important part of the game.  If you can't acknowledge that than it's obvious you didn't play vanilla and don't understand what made it great.
---
These are the default fonts for the beta and 1.12 respectively.

I think an average person of reasonable intelligence can figure out what OP meant... i.e. while moving, you can only use instant abilities

PS: before you criticize someone’s innocent spelling mistake (you shouldn’t, assuming you aren’t actively trying to be a prick) perhaps you should ensure that you are using proper grammar yourself. Your comment should read “when can you” not “when you can.” Lul...
---
Orc warrior &gt;&gt;&gt; Undead.
---
warriors already have a fear break.  orcs stun resistance is OP and +5 weapon skill to axes is huuuge
---
&gt; fury DW PVP warrior   
---
You honestly should have hid this tidbit.
---
Also worth mentioning that the range cap for numbers is far lower. 
---
You cannot view your numbers on a target which is too far away, in vanilla you could, nothing more satisfying that watching that juicy bolt finally connect to a rogue sprinting for his life
---
it makes a huge difference but by the time you grind enough cloth, you will already be close to level 10. So there is no way to min/max this one on launch.
---
You mean the fears on a predictable cooldown that can be trivialized by an ability that all Warriors get?
---
Warriors don't need Will of the Forsaken in raids.
---
Yeah, you can just put your ridiculous opinion out there with no basis in logic or reason because its the internet!
---
It's a tricky one; with no PVP gear I'm going to struggle for the first two phases but I'm hoping my slightly OP class (shadow priest) will be able to hold its own with bought gear until phase 3, at which point I'll switch to disc and gear through PVP. My friends will be raiding hardcore in their own guild so I'll be taking benediction as soon as their priests have it. If not I'll try and buy it from a raid carry.
---
I love travelling Azeroth and levelling so will enjoy doing that on a couple of alts as well.
---
Facing warriors with MS &amp; Death Wish doesn't sound very fun.
---
Let me tell you what one of my memorable classic experiences was.  I got killed over and over by a Tauren druid named Moonster levels 20-30.  He was perpetually 3 levels ahead of me and always seem to come across me.  He would sometimes camp a bit too, and he'd kill be mercilessly every time he saw me. The fights would usually be close too, as I was no slouch, but he'd always win.
---
So I didn't see him again... Until I was in Burning Steppes.  Normally I'm pretty merciful Paladin, but you'd better believe I ran straight at him swinging.  After a looooong fight I killed him.  So freaking satisfying that I never forgot it.  A true vanilla WoW experience.
---
This would NEVER happen with layering.  The odds I would be in the same layer each time with him, enough to build up a rivalry, are exponentially slim to none. I might not have even ran across him at burning steppes.
---
This is just one example off the top of my head.
---
&gt;Do people also forget that this issue is a temporary fix to the problem and will go away after the first month?
---
This is absolutely not a guarantee and I'd bet you $ it will be around longer than that.  It could be around perpetually if they let servers get too large and those servers don't see a significant decline in population (looking at you, streamer servers).
---
You sure buddy?
---
None of these classes would be top dps with a little more mana.
---
Giving priest more mana would make holy priest better too, do they need a buff?
---
How do you plan to only buff the mana regen of these specs without talent/item changes?
---
No, although Rexxar is basically a hermit and makes it a priority to be as far away from civilization as possible, so it makes sense he'd be in the middle of nowhere.
---
Awesome! Maybe I'll roll tauren now.. but then again Undead.. but shamans...but mages... hunters are cool... I've always wanted a priest...but tanking could be fun.. warlocks are well liked for summons... 
---
That how I've been feeling since I watched them announce it at blizzcon..lol
---
Hahah ya I know. It would be so awesome. Oh well, we can dream.
---
Poor OOMkins. They have to endure such fowl treatment.
---
No mention in the article of two popular categories of names:
---
Puns
---
Naming undead characters after recently deceased celebrities
---
Probably just be a ton of 31/21 builds. For a lot of builds it really comes down to whether you want the the final talent of a tree or not. 
---
A Shaman would basically just keep the same PvP build, but he'd be able to get Elemental Mastery and Nature's Swiftness instead of having an interesting choice to make.
---
Basically the game would be more boring. Those choices are fun and class defining.
---
Aye spirit of redemption is a really nice AB talent. If someone calls out the next gy res wave you can stay in SoR then cancel it for an instant res. If it were a disc talent definitely worth 1pt imo, but not worth going holy for.
---
I would still get imp healing from holy though. (Greater) heal is more mana efficient and has higher healing output than flash heal, anytime you can get away with the 2.5s cast you should use it. The GH trinket from ZG is also the best priest trinket in the game.
---
&gt; perhaps you should ensure that you are using proper grammar yourself. Your comment should read “when can you” not “when you can.” Lul...
---
There's a difference between writing something that has a *completely different meaning all together* compared to a minor mistake someone who doesn't have english as his first language (like me) would make. By a difference, I mean quite a big difference.

I play ally mainly. But man I can never find it in my heart to make a Male night elf, I just think they look so fucking derpy and I really dislike all their animations. Sorry bro just my opinion
---
People giving up/leaving the dungeon group after a couple of wipes. This happened to me a lot back in the day when I was around level 18-22 on my warlock running DM...
---
This isn't a bad idea if the playerbase is growing and getting new blood.  If it's not all you're doing is cannibalizing your older servers and killing them.  Learn from the past mistakes private servers and live servers.
---
Well EU got german/french servers from complaining a lot.
---
More complaints = more chance of a change
---
DA:I's DLC is *so much fun*. The whole underground dwarven empire thing they had going on had me hooked all the way through.
---
Classic WoW is my WoW retirement plan. I would be excited for the people who really want the benefits that future expansions had to offer, but I'd never seriously play any of them. As long as there are Classic servers, that's where I'll stay.        
---
            
---
If they ever forced progression on classic to TBC or otherwise, I'd quit right away.
---
It's the same as it used to be.  This is not a new mechanic.
---
Female night elf have the best character models

Classic addons are built on a different API than 1.12 addons

Streamer only. lol. God i really hope i don't end up on a server with any of them at all.

Rogue and warlock are a bad matchup for every other class? I don't think that's especially true, paladins and warriors often stomp rogues dont they?
---
The C'thun Eye says: -Pew-!
---
Here are my thoughts on an Open beta for classic.
---
1. Will creating an "Open Beta" ruin the game? No. 
---
2. The game is the game and those that want to play will play. 
---
3. The people that will join the open beta and see that its not for them are all the retail babies that want max level in an afternoon.
---
4. Open beta will weed out "casuals" for launch. Allowing smoother leveling in the first week.
---
5. Needing a sub to play in the beta will generate cash for Blizz, but if u /quit just trying to get to 40, doubt you stay longer and 1 month in the full game.
---
Mountain Lion Blood in Hillsbrad. 90% of Mountain Lions don't have blood apparently. FUCK THAT QUEST, and Shimmering Flats
---
I hear ya, I dont think there is a "pass or fail" type of grading system, but I think there are varying levels of general difficulty for us to take a stab at. Maybe a 1-5 implied difficulty scale for each matchup?
---
And my bow. And my sword. And my dagger. And my polearm. And my sword.

I agree, my favourite is F nightelf and M undead. Yet I've gained a fucking gnome since TBC 😂

i use shift as a modifier for every key binding. my pinky is buff yo

I remember the eternity it took to install the game from 4 different discs in 2004 versus playable in 20 mins on my current 300 mbps connection...times have changed

😂🤏🤏
---
Last month was Alliance Pride.
---
&gt; Skins while leveling is simply extra vendor trash
---
I've seen this a few times here, but I wonder... why vendor instead of sending to your bank alt for AH? Is the profit margin to slim, or just too much delay?
---
I promise i can read.  Thanks for the replies.  that would be why i didn't have it.
---
That gets me to 2256 cit with no spell power and a 3.857 multiplier for each point of spell power.
---
So 1233 spell power for a 7k crit, which is doable on a double trinket.  
---
This kind of makes me want to work out the ceiling for everyone else.  
---
Playing around with this also has me convinced that in aq40/naxx gear a doomchicken should actually out dps a T3 hunter on average on fights under 3.5 minutes.   Which is dumb, hunters really don't scale for crap.
---
Just one?
---
Shit, just replace the raid tier gear with 5 extra levels each.
---
Saw this thread this morning with no replies and hoped by the end of the day the entire song would be parodied, you did not disappoint me /r/classicwow.
---
taurens were lvl1 alliance players
---
Why did you pick priest for healing if I may ask?
---
I dont completely disagree.  I rolled NE M because I was able to create a character that looked like my D&amp;D character I used to draw in HS.  Mainly, long blue hair. (you gotta have blue hair)
---
World enlarger and noggenfogger would get you pretty close
---
Yup
---
You do realize blizz purposely made the important talents far up enough so you wont be able to do exactly this right??
---
Otherwise you'll get hunters with scatter shot and beastial wrath. Or shamans with stormstrike and 100% increased crit dms from spells, making earth shock crits insanely huge, stacking from 20% dmg increase from SS and ele talent
---
I agree, there is a difference. That’s not the point. You clearly pointed out the fact that the word “while” was misspelled... Did you forget that part?
---
It perfectly feels like an argument that you can’t prove, just to spite me.
---
I've been quiet the whole time. I actually want to be on a layer all by myself so I can reach 60 as soon as possible.
---
Waiting in queue for Garrick Padfoot / Sarkoth sure is immersive.
---
Probably not. They will join me for a beer later that night. My point is: sometimes it’s just about the fun. My raid experience is mostly being whispered  “hey we need to fill a spot for xxx raid, you in?”  And I say hell yes and that’s plenty fun.
---
None of that has to do with someone who reliably shows up every week.
---
Thanks.  I luched out bigtime getting that sword.  I saved up all my RPP when the rest of the warriors were spending theirs on Wrath Plate.

ye there's a config panel and you can change it
---
50% raid dps is an exploit.  fact.
---
Calm down.
---
Yeah, go enjoy your dirt shacks you superior beings!
---
/u/gizmuo, I love you for this.
---
Not really. People are going to be the way they are.
---
Not much to be done to change how people are.
---
Merging sooner might prevent servers from progressing more than other servers. The attitude is really just dependent on the people.
---
Yup. In this pic, half the raid was already dead.
---
On the stress test I went on server 15 I believe? It seemed perfectly fine. Maybe because everyone else was on the other server though.
---
Definitely respec costs. Pain in the ass as a healer or when you want to Raid and PvP.
---
Reading through your old posts, I now see that you really know very little about this game. You are learning from youtube videos about private servers and trying to make these arguments.
---
Your recent posts :

3 x "What class should I play?"

1 x "Why do people skip the NE starting zone?" (In this thread you ask questions about quests in starting zones, implying you don't even know much about those, never mind end game content).

You clearly are not very well informed on this game. You shouldn't be getting so worked up about it. You will be a casual player in a casual guild. Just enjoy the game.Or don't. Noone cares.
---
Hi there, I'm not totally sure I understand this spreadsheet, it's just a bunch of black boxes. How exactly do you see the gear?
---
Proud alliance member here but I pay my respects to this tribute.
---
Ya totally not vanilla like. The biggest census out there shows shaman in 2 class most picked
---
Well, I just called it the best game ever made, so yeah - I think it’s worth finishing. 93% on Metacritic also. Both expansions are also amazing.
---
i like this post Xralius. Layering is going to pretty game breaking if it is not removed after a week or two. Im back for Classic and strictly Classic. Quit after Cata. If layering is constantly breaking my Immersion, I will quit Classic, and I will be sad about that. 
---
I dont think we can talk enough about Layering ahead of the classic launch imo.
---
Good point. Didn’t think about it cannibalising older servers. Maybe have fresher servers open only for new subscribers.
---
Have you never played an computer game? Or seen a guide?
---
There's always a million people online talking about optimizing and getting everything done faster. It's implied, if not explicitly stated, that if you aren't following the meta, and min-maxing your build, then you're not playing correctly and no one wants to play with you.
---
I'm not treating anyone like children. It's fine that you might think its a given that you can play however you want, but that's not necessarily a given for people who didn't play games before the era of blazing pace, instant-gratification and low attention spans.
---
I have a general dislike for bots but part of me actually thinks it isnt so bad.
---
If you make your money from the fun non bottable content like dungeon loot then you dont have bots driving the prices of what you sell down. On the flipside, all the stuff bots farm will be cheaper. In that thinking, crafting professions will be more profitable as well because the mats will be cheaper.
---
&gt; How is your mount at 40 secured?
---
OP will be a warlock. One of the two classes (Paladin) that has a 'free' class mount at 40.
---
I think he just wanted to have some fun brainstorming those ridiculously strong but strategically shallow combinations there chief
---
Dunno if that's allowed here tho this is a pretty serious high level board
---
Yea, we are done man. Bad troll is bad.
---
How'd they do that on the PvP server?
---
I have forgotten more about this game then you know.
---
Nice red herring btw
---
It's infuriating to watch the game inevitably fail in front of my eyes before I even get to play it.  Been waiting so long and now I have to go back to fucking private servers.
---
The second screenshot is using an adding to change the font style. It's obvious that it's myriad bold or whatever the default ElvUi font. The first font is very clearly the actual original font, with simply heightened resolution (which everyone should be OK with).
---
Just because I'll have tailoring maxed before I level the priest.  Otherwise I'd be shaman which was another main for me in retail since I can be paladin (another main one xpac).  Since Classic/Vanilla was harder for alts I was thinking of limiting myself to main three first unless I can do more after.
---
My dude. It's CRICKETY in CLASSIC.
---
lol exactly, that guy is clearly pathetic and bad at the game.
---
That's true, you pretty much just die in pvp if you're solo. Rogue? Eh.. 50/50. I've nearly killed rogues while leveling at low level with one big overpower crit. Frost mage? SUPER dead. Don't even think about it unless it's a moron of a player. Hunter? Probably also dead. Warlock? depends on spec, but probably dead. Priest? Good luck getting through that bubble to actually generate any rage. List goes on.
---
However, what I find really interesting is when you throw in healer that can cleanse. Of course, any 2v1 fight, the 2 should win obviously, but even if all I got was a BoF against a mage... that mage is screwed. Personally I'm planning to level all the way to 60 with a group of friends.
---
Can you heal across the Alliance-Horde divide though? Or talk?
---
Ahh, thank you :) Makes more sense now lol
---
Rexxar hunts alone!
---
I think Asmongold was on number 15, so I think that would have been the most populated one.
---
Read the post again. Didn't write that anywhere.
---
I did however write "Do whatever you want in the game". So make of that what you want I guess
---
Oh ok, maybe it was the other one. The one I was on had people in the starting area, but it wasn't like a massive amount.
---

You can most certainly have dots on you and not be in combat. Damage over time doesn’t lock you into combat, only new aggressive actions by or against you will do that. If you’ve played rogue, you’ve probably encountered a situation where that very last tick of a dot keeps you from stealthing, and your opponents are able to reengage. Shadowmeld solves this (admittedly very specific) problem.
---
I’ll use AV as an example. You’re running into a bunker and eat a Blizzard tick, knocking you out of stealth. You duck behind the doorframe to restealth, but the mage peers over the edge and starts casting at you before your stealth is off cooldown. Most rogues are forced to burn a vanish, or remain locked in combat. Night elves are able to Shadowmeld, breaking target and buying time for their stealth cooldown to finish.
---
This next example works in any battleground. An enemy is riding by and you’re able to sap them. You stand there, waiting the 6s to get out of combat, but stealth has a 10s cooldown. You’re exposed for 4s longer than you need to be, possibly inviting enemy attention. Shadowmeld solves this problem.
---
I’m not saying NEs are the superior rogue or anything, but rumors of Shadowmeld’s uselessness are spread by people who haven’t used it to its fullest potential.
---
He always says that and yet he always has an animal with him. He literally never does what he says.
---
Heh. Fowl. Cause its a lazerchicken.
---
Ah yeah I used MSBT and forgot it was only next to you. Felt enough for me.
---
What's that guys name? Greasemonkey? Funkmonkey? The frost mage who would solo elites back in the day. 
---
So funny to watch now but people used to think that was amazing.
---
Will they, though? If everything goes according to plan, we're going to be getting WoW: Classic: Remastered around that time.
---
Layering fluctuating like crazy in a *beta* is evidence it's going to be that random? My god, this subreddit has truly lost it's mind.
---
Mainly farming group instances for the same purpose, gathering professions, playing the auction house (but that's a little more involved.)
---
lol yup! My local microcenter actually has that Prime X470-Pro so I may get that, thanks! Not sure if I want to get a new x570 when that x470-pro looks compatible with most of the new gen chips. I actually upgraded my PSU to a Corsair 750w, got it for $60 refurbished and is doing the job so far perfectly

More immersive than watching people disappear in front of you in-game and having the economy busted to fuck by the 2 month mark.
---
...I remember wiping the entire raid on Sindragosa Heroic cause I managed to pull aggro despite waiting 5 seconds on the tank...sigh...
---
About your last paragraph, that's a big reason why a lot of guilds don't work.  You get a core group of people that become very close and it feels bad for everyone else.  It's extremely difficult to be inclusive with 40 people, whether it's intentional or not.
---
Do we have proof from someone in the beta testing it? For example have two people in a duel. Both moving at max leeway range able to hit each other, then apply wingclip or hamstring. Then see if they are now unable to hit each other?
---
skip it and go grind
---
waiting in line is a trap for the normies who you'll outlevel
---
we need more traps to set us apart from them
---
I made a priest after raiding with a hunter as I was often feeling healers were slacking.     
---
I don't remember raids that well but I think it is usually stressful as you are always trying to balance healing  and saving your mana, which means canceling very often. I guess if incoming heals is well indicated nowadays, the canceling aspect might be a bit less present.    It always felt like you were pushed to the extent of your capabilities though, always flirting with oom and not having a pot to bring yourself back up.    
---
I don't remember doing much dungeons , I think I went straight to raids though I wonder what kind of gear I had if that was truly the case (my character is frozen as lvl70 sadly so I cannot check and I stopped early in tbc https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/ysondre/asmodeal ).   
---
In pve it is gathering mostly since holy is not exactly the best to farm monsters, I got tired of that which probably motivated me quitting, should have just played an alt but gathering the comps for raids was demanding.
---
which part
---
&gt;We've now found plenty of documented leeway from original WoW. There's little question that leeway is very very real and it's how it worked and that the whole internet connection thing is just a big load of bollocks.  
---
&gt;What we don't know for sure is if leeway is working exactly as it should, namely if it should work or not when one player is snared or rooted. If it works when walking instead of running. Backpeddaling for instance does cancel it out.
---
Well said. Cheers
---
Please do Benediction / Anathema, my God.
---
Completing some of these elite quests is some of the most fun I've had in an MMO in a long time.  They require so much effort and coordination usually.  Makes for great gameplay moments.
---
Within faction its much easier out of faction its all down to how your character emotes or you choose to make your character act aka hostility etc.
---
&gt;Can’t believe you dumb fucks
---
Calm down and shave your neckbeard. It’s just a game.
---
I also played priest in some PvP.
---
Rexxar does whatever he wants.
---
Stress test is available to all, assuming you're sub'd right?
---
God I'm glad I'm out of that loop. I presume it's a Twitch thing? God I'm glad I haven't got a Twitch account. Why can't thirsty neckbeards empty their sack before being all emotional and chasing silly thots. Or maybe clean their bedrooms and get a future.
---
True
---
How exactly is shadowmeld good?  Prior to the last big TBC patch it was little more than a crappy stealth that broke upon movement and nothing else.  At least with the referenced patch it made it useful for breaking aggro so rogues and druids could go back into actual stealth.  What am I missing about this racial that makes it good in vanilla?
---
Downvote me away but I’m glad this trash wasn’t upvoted to hell. Most unoriginal nonsense karma grab. Don’t care if 6 of you have downvoted me.
---
Agreed but it's a totally different conversation as these builds are poles apart - hence the new thread :)
---
Appreciated, though, I'll see what info is on that thread
---
You can have a dot and be out of combat at the same time.
---
Oh i read it.
---
You say that people will read a leveling guide and rush to max level because these guides dont have fun* baked into them.
---
These guides are for people that want to minmax and hit 60 in the shortest amount possible, they are simply not made for people that want to take it slow and have fun*
---
If you want a fun leveling guide make one, i would be glad to read it even though i wont use it
---
*fun is subjective while i find it fun to rush and be competetive you may find it fun to take it slow and enjoy the lowlevel content to its fullest.
---
I am sure they are very aware of the issues people encountered and why they are issues. We will see if they can/will do anything about it.
---
You're going to love it! The story is fantastic and all of the locations are really darn pretty. The music is on point too. Hope you enjoy it!
---
Druid healer. Loved it especially if you are a big pvper. There is so much potential with the different animal forms and spell set. Combat res, innervate, two hots, natures swiftness, root...hmm maybe I'm rolling druid again. :)
---
I loved using travel form to runaround the outskirts of a big fight dropping hots, roots, etc.
---
You say that like it’s a bad thing. We play MMOs as a *social* game. If you want to be faceless in a sea of 20k ever shifting people, and think people are wrong for wanting to be part of a Vanilla community, you might be into the wrong game.
---
You can really do this for anything, watch. 
---
The real reason you hate LFR- You know it doesn’t hurt anybody, so why do you hate it? Deep down, you just like to feel superior to people. You want to take away peoples right to play the game, and you want to be the only special snowflake to see the content. Are you a no life neck beard? You probably hate LFR because regular people with lives can do the content and still get laid, while you’re wasting your time on an artificial hard mode to inflate your ego. 
---
This kind of shit writes itself, just drop yourself down a couple mental pegs and go with it.
---
I did. My point was not about it tho.
---
The ability to ambush. It is especially useful in BGs. Also, if you just need to AFK to use the restroom.
---
I think the problem is you can't seem to wrap your head around these issues being massively applicable, cumulative, and reoccurring.  Also, the unknown, the possible ramifications, are just as important as the ramifications we know will happen.
---
1.  Yes. A bad thing happening more often is bad.
---
2.  Again just because it's a subtle negative doesn't mean it should be ignored.
---
3.  If you change layers, you would experience this.  You're welcome to argue that it's not a big deal, but you can't argue that it's not a fact, or that it's ideal.
---
4.  Since you don't understand I'll use an example:
---
Let me tell you what one of my memorable classic experiences was. I got killed over and over by a Tauren druid named Moonster levels 20-30. He was perpetually 3 levels ahead of me and always seemed to come across me. He would sometimes camp a bit too, and he'd kill me mercilessly every time he saw me. The fights would usually be close too, as I was no slouch, but he'd always win.
---
So I didn't see him again... Until I was in Burning Steppes. Normally I'm pretty merciful Paladin, but you'd better believe I ran straight at him swinging. After a looooong fight I killed him. So freaking satisfying that I never forgot it. A true vanilla WoW experience.
---
This would NEVER happen with layering. The odds I would be in the same layer each time with him, enough to build up a rivalry, are exponentially slim to none. I might not have even ran across him at burning steppes.
---
5.  Fair enough.
---
6.  I understand how economies work.  This very well could be a non-issue, but I included it because theoretically there could be issues.
---
7.  Do you hate math?  I'm talking about overarching trends here, not one specific instance.  
---
8.  I figured everyone's already seen the many cases of people abusing layering.  Also, I left it vague because people can always come up with new ways to abuse it.
---
9.  Even with a cd this can be abused.  Doubling one's rewards once/day for something valuable is still significant in the long run.
---
10.  Do you hate math or simply not understand the basic concepts of what I'm saying?  I'm not saying you won't run into people as often.  I'm saying you won't run into the same people as often.
---
11.  Correct.  My point is that layering might not fix the problem it's intending to, which is a con.
---
12.  If what you're saying is a better option than layering, why not do that instead of layering?
---
13.  What I'm saying is overcrowding is not a bad thing, necessarily, so implementing layering to avoid it might be detrimental.  I'm saying overcrowding can be good.
---
14. The less people in a "layer" the less worldpvp, period.
---
15.   Obviously you might be right, but the potential is still a con.
---
It makes no sense to not have Lightning Mastery...
---
Oh, let's all play Classic, where the journey is the goal, and it's not just about instant gratification and convenience...
---
...but please don't make me wait a second for a mob, and don't let situations arise where I would benefit from communicating with other players in my area!
---
Seeing the reaction around layering, I'm beginning to see that huge parts of the "Classic community" don't seem to want an actual Vanilal experience. All they seem to want is to tourist through the content, to gobble it all up like gluttons, and then move on, like locusts, never caring for the state their "convenience" leaves the server behind in.

---
Improved renew only applied to the base healing portion of renew in vanilla and I mostly downranked renews, so for me it wasn't mandatory. Holy spec I really like.. critical heals can turn a fight around. Divine fury is good even without improved healing imo, sometimes you need the extra healing per second from greater heal to keep someone up, plus the reduced cast time on smite helps when you need to assist dps. Spell warding is nice for duels, in BGs it's mostly melee that give me a headache.
---
Blessed recovery is a talent I'm torn on.. it's underwhelming if you get crit repeatedly because the buff gets overwritten, but against warriors you should get most of the benefit. Did you ever measure how much health you typically got back from it?
---
If they are expensive on AH, barter in general offering a stack of linen for a wand. I think a lot of people would take that as well.
---
Stoneform is relatively easy to play around if you think a few moves ahead. Open, dot, gouge as stoneform removes dot, sprint disengage, restealth. The fight is now reset with a burned stoneform, putting blind on the table and giving the elf stealth advantage once more. A good dwarf will learn to play around this pretty quickly, but it’s such a specific scenario that most won’t have counterplays practiced to automatic speed.
---
At the end of the day, this only matters in duels. Night elves and dwarves won’t ever fight each other in BGs or world PvP (gurubashi arena notwithstanding), so it’s not an important matchup by any stretch.
---
I can see where this could cause a lot of drama, but it wasn't my experience. I raided with my gf at the time without any issues.
---
What do you consider next to nothing? And should I go right to a Best buy physical store location, or look online somewhere?
---
Your build seems to be a largely inferior version to the PvP meta 30/0/21 discussed a few replies down -- by ignoring the cast time reduction on LB and CL you're giving up a 50% DPS gain (3s cast to 2s) on your damaging spells for 5% more mana and a resto talent. The pros and cons of 30/0/21 are discussed a couple of replies down
---
You forgot the "compared to where i normally play, on private servers...", because the parry % won't be any different than it used to be on *The Vanilla*.
---
Because at this point it's personal.
---
Waiting for named mobs sure is the pinnacle of the vanilla experience.
---
You seem simple
---
Size XL only? Man isnt committed enough. Embrace the 300 lb. Plus club and get XXL adult diapers.

The hoofless Zhevras. How are they walking?
---
From my (admittedly limited) experience, you won't be able to keep professions relevant to your leveling unless you devote equal time + gold to that side of the game. Maybe skinning and tailoring, but you need to check where you are leveling for beasts and humanoids. If you pick the wrong zones there may be no materials for a few levels and then those would fall behind too. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For some people, keeping your profs in the same range as you levels helps them to slow down the game and 'enjoy the journey'. I'd rather just keep up with my friends, but sometime that allows me to take a break from leveling to advance professions.
---
2 hours a day? If I were only putting in that kind of time, questing and finding a group for one dungeon a night would be my only focus.
---
But what if you were already a gnome druid in boomkin and then used those? You cool lazer chicken people as a tiny spec!
---
2 as of now
---
If you enjoyed playing druid I would consider resto especially if you are skilled and understand the different forms. A well played resto druid is a scary thing in PvP.
---
How dare you sir! How dare you use the F-word on this sub!
---
This is going to be a HUGE culture shock to any retail players that use discord. I've found in every guild, even mythic progression guilds there's so many people that talk.
---
Every item in the game will have it’s 1.12 stats, always.
---
In general, items added in 1.3 and 1.4 won’t be available until Phase 2.
---
Items added in 1.5 and 1.6 won’t be available until Phase 3.
---
Items added in 1.7 and 1.8 won’t be available until Phase 4.
---
Items added in 1.9 and 1.10 won’t be available until Phase 5.
---
Items added in 1.11 and 1.12 won’t be available until Phase 6.
---
Ion said there are a few exceptions to this ruleset, but he didn’t list them. Some big questions like the Rank 14 weapons that weren’t added until 1.11, some of the loot from Molten Core (Majordomo didn’t give anything until patch 1.4), and some other things have not been answered.
---
That’s so cool, must’ve been the happiest guy in the Raid that night. Grats!:)

I mean in practice it does indeed not matter much, since most enhancements in pve will go with Nightfall anyway, but it could be interesting to think about, if using a really fast Weapon could have an positive impact on PVE dps due to triggering WF more if there is indeed no ICD

Amazing game, top 5 for sure, replayed it many times. Too bad they fucked Inquisition up so much, and I heard the fourth one is gonna be even worse with "online as service" type gameplay.
---
I plan on roll troll for shadow guard black outs vs melee and point per value spell warding gives a better return than imp inner fire does, improved greater healing talents work with berserk to make your racial trinket heals really strong (especially when you have high stam gear and not a ton of+\_healing) . Imp mana burn, holy nova, black out and mental agility seam to be the money talents to get. Also it doesn't hurt to have some pve capability for casual raids.
---
Was considering something like this for a non PI build:     [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsVboZbAtccZV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsVboZbAtccZV) 
---
Other wise likely the 21 points in shadow for silence which is a big investment for the 28/2/21 build. 19/1/21 tri spec seams possible too but lacks mental agility which is the best mana talent as you dispel a ton and you save more mana on the discount than the max mana pool of 400-600.
---
31/20/0 or 32/19/0 seems better for undead where black out isnt as good. Either you drop holy, go 11 poitns for holy nova or just cut improved healing maybe with 31/15/5.
---
dude I do not understand why people are hating on you so much for this post lol. you are simply saying what could happen in its worst form, which is, an issue. holy moly. I for one, didnt even know this existed because i quit retail after Cata so this is news to me and concerns me on a certain level.

The law of large numbers would suggest this is random to an extent, so if you merged servers before strong community identities were entrenched it would mitigate the damage, I'd think, at least on average?

You surely understand that “difficult” is subjective...?

Thank you!

Yeah because balancing can't be done without homogenization, it's totally acceptable to leave useless specs in the game (all hybrid dps'ers) for sure!
---
They do have derpy animations but I like big warriors. Especially for tanking. Dwarfs are an exception as they're tiny but they are sturdy so I can tank as one.
---
He doesn't do any damage so him showing up every week is hurting the raid.  Instead of taking someone who is helping you are carrying him through the raid.  Every piece of loot he receives could have went to someone contributing to the raid.
---
Notice how the person stated "we managed to clear MC with him".  MC is a joke (very easy).  This guild would never be able to clear the harder content with players like this in the raid
---
Fully agree. I would be just as excited for TBC or Wrath servers as I am for Classic, but wouldn't care for anything new added.
---
#Nochanges is just as valid for the other expansions as it is for Classic.

lol w/e so i didnt know the exact copy pasta name kill me

You're a Shaman in Classic? ok STFU and heal.

Hunters are finally understanding "you think you do, but you don't".

All of these issues Classic hunters hate are from Vanilla. They need to get over it.

He looks badass.

I was so excited when I ran into Rexxar for the first time.
---
That's one of the things I loved about this game. Because it was so massive, literally just setting out to explore was a legitimate thing to do for fun that would take quite some time to complete. I did that on my hunter, exploring zones I had no business in lol.

Of course, once I got flying, the world just seemed that much smaller...
---
Yes, but most of the latency comes from distance, much smaller percentage comes from signal processing. So improvement in bandwidth really doesn't affect it all that much.
---
The vast majority of players don't consider wiping on easy raid content to be fun.  most guilds will kill ony easily their first attempt but your raid is dying for hours.  good luck keeping all 40 players when the other guilds start poaching the raiders who are carrying your dead weight
---
&gt;I saved up all my RPP when the rest of the warriors were spending theirs on Wrath Plate.
---
While you were out having sex, I studied the blade.
---
My range is multi-dimensional - I can hop layers.
---
I think it's a wise choice haha. There's been just a ton of "my thoughts on layering" and such, shouldn't the subject be blacklisted at some point? It's been discussed through and through and people have nothing constructive to bring anymore... Same goes for hunter bugs and such, it's all known, and going through posts has become awful...
---
pvp gear what?
---
No, but layering will kill this game.
---
Druids in my guild may be Boomkins once we've killed KT.
---
This is really only going to affect Warrior DPS since they have no threat dump. Rogues don't care if the boss is parrying more often.
---
I attacked him. It didn't end well.
---
I believe it's anyone with an active sub. Same as the last test.
---
I like Tauren the best but, that's because my character mentality is that of a ten year old. I need to have the largest shoulders and, the biggest most Phallic sword possible. I know the real equation for winning. Real big shoulders + Real big weapon = real big damage.
---
I'll be pretty surprised if there aren't PUG raids at some point.
---
There was a bug that allowed that to happen in Vanilla.
---
Lol love the names
---
Well, that's a good point.  I suppose I just assumed we'd all be fury for raids.  
---
Respec to Fury at 60 :)
---
I would bet not
---
weapon independence is a huge QoL for leveling, 
---
Spells usually don't miss.
---
Spamming LB is the fastest way to kill mobs, so fast that even with regular drinking it still beats out 2h rockbiter.
---
untill AQ40 hits though, then fire is the best spec.
---
This is the first real non biased answer to my question. See, this is what i was asking and 99% of you couldnt give a single explanation on why do you believe people won't be acting the same as they would anywhere else. They will act just like on any other servers, but you as a community can do something against it.  
---
Please stop with all the magical utopias, where everyone will be a kind and selfless soul, just because it says RP- next to your server's name. Every second comment here including the OP saying that, RP- tagged servers never had trolls or they've met a single one, but everyone else was a saint.   
---
Now i could go into debating that the same 'community force' was applied on my PvP server, as it was really easy to acquire bad reputation, by being a dick. But i think that's for some other post and not this one, coz most of you feel personally attacked by a single question that i asked.
---
I Would really recommend, if you want to pvp, to go undead. Devouring plague is way to OP for PVP.
---
What are the negatives?

[WOW CLASSIC “NOT A BUG” LIST](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887)
---
- “Melee leeway” is working as intended.
---
Oh wow that's a surprisingly high %.. i gotta try a full bg run with 3/3 and meters on sometime
---
&gt; These issues
---
Some of those are straight buffs, a majority are cosmetic, and some of them are just how it's going to be (artificial spell batching).
---
And yet none of them are mentioned by OP, and thus irrelevant to my comment.
---
Paladin out rolling me on Shadowblade shoulders?  Yea  that shit was stupid
---
To be honest I am biased against layering and I ran out of steam.  I wish I had a done a better job being objective tbh.
---
PVE depends on tier and raid makeup. If your guild doesn't carry a shadow priest, locks will be lower no matter what. Silly not to have 1 sp, but some guilds wont.
---
In naxx the ignite rolling is going to be broken, but outside of that lock is better(assuming the tank can keep threat cuz locks have no threat drop)
---
Early endgame locks dont get enough +hit from gear so they will be hard pressed to keep up.
---
Right around AQ time is when it is even.
---
Guilds will still usually want at least 3 locks for each rank of healthstone, so there is that...
---
In PvP, I'd always play lock over mage (at 60). You can constantly blow people up as opposed to the "3min mage". Or you can dot the whole team and laugh as their heals refuse to cleanse those they arent friends with.
---
Nice man its a great idea you have right here
---
Why do you even care about your dps? Like so what if your class does less number than the mage? It's really nothing important, you have guarenteed raid spots anyway, and you should compete against people of your own class instead of worry about how good other classes perform in the current tier.
---
Tons of ZG, Ony and AQ20 pugs on the pserver I played on, but I never really saw any BWL, AQ40 and definitely not Naxx unless it was a guild of 38 lf2m.
---
Only because you are an idiot and don't follow the instructions. Microwave for the time it says then let stand for 5 minutes _like it says on the freaking box_ and it will be perfectly cooked every time. Nobody ever lets them stand so they bite, eat cold, nuke it again and and now its too hot. If you let it stand for 5 minutes as directed it will be evenly heated throughout as it continues to cook after the microwave stops.
---
True I just also think playing with the server the whole time helps. I know people keep saying you will be on different layers constantly but the last few stress tests they got chats working right.
---
So while I am on a different server I never had an issue finding groups at will because chats are server wide not layer wide. I also like that economies and communities aren’t as damaged via layering (assuming they mitigate the layer hopping abuse). Cause everyone is there from the start.
---
Consider this, many quests you won't be able to do due to the "launch" population. So grinding is gonna be one of the things you are gonna do the most.
---
Now, if you combine grinding with Humanoids, you are going to get cloths, a lot of them, so in this case you may be looking good to level tailor as you level your character.
---
You are cool, man! Thanks for doing good work!
---
No he wasn’t
---
Thats a valid point of view, and i don't disagree.
---
However, given the limitations currently facing wow classic, if you had to make a choice between one RP-PvP server or one RP-PvE server, which would you choose?
---
I would choose the latter.
---
Naxx is still though from a numbers standpoint even though the mechanics are simple.
---
Wasn't Medivh her father in the movie? He traveled between the realms before the portal was opened.
---
Shh don’t tell people that. More people wasting their time walking around the less people questing
---
That’s alright.
---
A PvE realm can still have RP.
---
RP'ers on a PvP realm that isnt RP-PVP will just get grief from non-RP'ers.
---
look up a bit of Nazir Katbi and his company then.
---
Could you offtank with your dps talents or did you have to reset talents before raid?
---
Each layer is meant to represent one vanilla wow server so ~3000 people. Private servers launch with around 15000 people.
---
&gt; I mean, tips held a tournament for horde and the alliance behaved
---
Because they were in a horde territory. The allaince could not attack horde. What is your point.
---
Somewhat: In WC3 RPG campaign after Rexxar helped Drek'thar and Thrall around Orgrimmar Thrall asks Rexxar to settle down and help establishing horde dominance in Durotar, the Barrens, Stonetalon Mountains. However Rexxar declains saying he is a lone wanderer content with living in the wilderness with his trusted Misha.
---
People need to remember stuff like this when we talk about things like leeway.
---
Blizzards data is shakey sometimes to the point where *they even messed up the original fonts and number floating* as compared to actual vanilla.
---
It’s not a crazy stretch to think they messed up something like leeway, which many of us remember differently and which there’s zero video evidence to support their current iteration.
---
This thread is 11/10, would read again. Will continue to read. xD
---
RemindMe! 50 days
---
Everyone loves shamans in raids, and druids a good healers, people will probably say druids are a little worse but having innervate and battle rez can be super duper clutch. There aren't a lot of druids so they're basically always welcome as healers.
---

Wynncraft in Minecraft. No mods, just feels like old school mmo.

Slow as fuck 2hander, spec survival something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cZZcbiMRhz
---
As for gear it's hard to say. Agility gives you zero melee power but it does give crit, and str gives you zero ranged power. So I guess try go for just pure attack power and crit items, and agility over strength.
---
I would go with warlock because of all the hunter bugs.
---
Ever heard of EverQuest? The old game is full of these cryptic quest chains. Project 1999 actually got a license to run a private server of the old version. If you want to experience the wild west of MMOs I highly recommend it.
---
Yep. On average I can parse higher than Hunter's. Under a HR-HR play I can sustain \~1400dps on a 3min fight. It's a uncommon occurrence though due to the RNG rolls.
---
&gt; there is a lot more info out there now which makes knowing the game and how to approach encounters so much easier.
---
I never get this statement. Sure gear is a bit more optimized but raid gear was usually an upgrade. And unless you were a cutting edge guild there were guides out there for all the raids that were just as accessible then as they are now, it was just a matter of guilds actually going and reading them.
---
Wow and wowclassic have a weird fixation on the word fun to be honest. In a way you're describing motitivation. I'm not even disagreeing with you, we just use the wrong word and that's why everybody thinks everyone is wrong. At a deep level you enjoy the challenge and competition of moving fast to achieve max level and its a motivator for you.
---
can relate
---
Troll is better for PvE for the most part having berserking, WOTF is super duper helpful in PvP to counter fears and charms, and I think polymorph too. I honestly can't stand the look of trolls and like PvP more than PvE so I would definitely go undead.
---
I think it would happen with layering though because y'all are obviously on the same layer.
---
If you’re aiming for flavour I’d dual wield axes.
---
Weapons- go after a really hard hitting (normally slow speed) 2 hander.  As a melee hunter you are basically just playing around raptor strike as your main source of damage.
---
You need to go after agility and stam as much as you can even as a melee hunter in terms of gear.
---
As for talents, just do whatever you think is good, but try to stay away mongoose bite talents, it’s a terrible ability that only does static damage and doesn’t base anything off your weapon.
---
What is more casual...
---
A guild that spends 30 minutes to clear ony or a guild that dies for 3 hours?  The quick kill seems more casual to me ;)
---
You will have lots of guilds that are considered "casual" who will clear the raid content cleanly while enjoying a fun, social atmosphere.  
---
This is how I raid.
---
I cannot confirm anything since I don't have beta and I don't watch much content, but I'd recommend asking perplexity when he's live : https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya He's an absolute god among men when it comes to rogues, and has been testing every single little detail. I'm 100% confident he knows the answer and he's usually happy to reply.
---
Which made DK fun on its own scope tho :')
---
&gt; There's a gang of Horde Rogues dedicated to camping Alliance streamers and this sub loves them
---
They don't camp. I agree with you on streamers rules and shit and people should 100% grief. But the ooga gang does not camp. They kill once and move on.
---
thats not the issues its the tank that will be dishing out less threat
---
Nah. That's allaince propaganda.
---
Thanks, is there a reason why you only put 2 points in the parry talent?
---
You can casually raid everything but aq40 and naxx, and you can start to casually raid aq40 with zg gear.
---
Alot of them are minor but it adds up to alot, also certain visual bugs impacts pvp, such as aimed shot timer not being concistent and impossible to cancel trap animation. There are more major cases like; delay on pet autocast abilities, general pet ai/bugs that is not similar to how it was, entrappment not working, traps automatically puts you in combat, multishot targeting totems, being able to directly run over traps without triggering given enough speed. 
---
&gt;All of these issues Classic hunters hate are from Vanilla
---
You didn't really address issues mentioned by OP, so i was generalizing.
---
oh one more thing, you stack stamina. 
---
Everything stamina
---
:) thx
---
There was blue post that every report has  human handling them so there is no automatic things happening from reports. Too lazy to try find it right now. :P
---
Thaddius when your polarity matches the tank.  
---
That's all I can think of.
---
Playing through Neverwinter Nights 1+all expansions, then doing nwn2 and all expansions, if I have time left I'll play player made modules of those games.
---
But why?
---
Don’t forget that vanilla was designed as a casual mmorpg
---
I've been Alliance since TBC when my friend convinced me to reroll on his faction. I wanted to go Horde again in classic but that same friend convinced me otherwise. Look like Horde was never meant to be.
---
Yep, tauren melee is now 42 yards.
---
Pretty sure you don't know a thing about programming.
---
These are **very** different things.
---
Big problem with locks will be threat. One big shadowbolt crit from a well geared warlock puts them on wand duty for a bit or they'll quite literally pull boss aggro off a tank.
---
It still sounds interesting to someone who doesn't care about leveling to 60 first or with any regard to speed. Just a fun thing to have monitored while playing to see how crazy some people are.
---
Not at all, they will talk about some past things but nothing that will break the feeling of the game, it's an amazing game, one of my top 5-10 ever. I have never played 1 or 2 btw, and have played 3 through 2x.
---

Look at the code.  It does a check to see if player "ISWALKING".  This seems to apply that movement speed should affect leeway being active.
---
Your forgetting cleave and aoe damage.

The White Monster (Boomer’s Delight,) is good but the blue zero carb/calorie/sugar Rockstar tastes great and has very very little of that diet after taste.

Love that shit, but my blood pressure isn’t great so I don’t have them often.

This is objectively testable and confirmable.
---
But if you remove every circle jerk post you might as well rename the sub /r/WoWNostalgiaScreenshots
---
Exactly, whispers and "class" channels were used all the time, both in game and the voice comm used. You literally never spoke in the /all raid channel, that was mostly organizers and leaders and about very important stuff only.
---
It's Friday. Have an upvote, you dwarven bastard.
---
There's a big diff between killing lowbies you come across while riding around and camping them over and over while they're trying to do a quest.
---
The former is normal, the latter is only fun to the kind of people who like to pull the wings of flies.
---
mongoose bite doesnt have talents
---
pserver vanilla experience guilds &gt;  retail or outdated and irrelevant original vanilla experience.  Don't @ me.
---
The gladiator set was available in the game before patch 1.3, so there's no reason to suspect it won't be available at launch.
---
&gt;meant to be fun, kinda roleplayish and PvP oriented
---
And I'm here playing wotlk because my computer can't run anything before that. ;-;
---
Melee dps is off to the side. If i recall correctly.
---
This is how it worked on private servers. It has been confirmed on the classic beta to be multiplicative, so 506% total.

There's a session from a game of overwatch played this afternoon.
---
Hop 6 is an IXP (Internet Exchange Point) in Dallas, Tx. Hop 7 is the front door of blizzard's proxies somewhere in California.
---
~1/3 of the trip is spent in last mile.
---
~1/5 of the trip is spent from the end of the last mile to the IXP (Georgetown, Tx to Dallas, Tx)
---
~1/2 of the trip is spent from Dallas to California.
---
The remainder is spent hoping around Blizzards proxies. 
---
I don't have a comparison from 2004. I was a sophomore in highschool and wasn't terribly interested in it. However, here's some things that have changed since then.
---
* More of the internet's backbone has migrated from copper to fiber (electric to light, light has higher QoS).
---
* Last mile has improved for most. DSL has been (continues to be) replaced by higher bandwidth (which depending on congestion can lead to lower latency) coaxial cable or by higherband width and lower latency fiber.
---
* Blizzard's internal routing isnt as awful as it was. Throughout this post, you'll see a number of people complaining about how their FPS latency was low, but their connection to their warcraft server was 100 ms higher. That's all going to have been after the equivalent to hop 7 in the image above. Their networking is better now and I imagine its a similar situation for their Warcraft servers.
---
Thing is, we know now that they are not planning to change items stats. But that still leaves us in the dark about a whole lot. First of all, theres tons of items that changed stats several times.
---
I guess we can assume blizzard will implent the 1.12 version. But by assuming that we can basically assume that a whole lot of these items wont be in the game till the final phase.
---
And were talking about alot more items then just the items that were introduced in said patch.
---
Alot of these items were already in the game, and changed over time.
---
Which is very weird in alot of cases, such as the gladiator chain, because its part of a set.
---
So in my head they either have to remove the set just because of the chestpiece.
---
Or they would allow the drop of the other setpieces, but this would leave us with an incomplete set (which is also fucking weird)
---
Neverwinter nights 1 and 2 are some of my all-time favs, how would you compare them to Pathfinder, I've been putting off buying that, I played some of pillars of eternity but couldnt get into it very much. It just made be boot up nwn after a few hours.
---
Don't recall on thadd, but Patch and Loatheb pretty sure dps isn't infront of them.
---
Kala is testing 1-10 speedruns for levelling and forcing wand early was a huge time saver. The DPS increase is massive.
---
..For fun and to be kinda rpish like the OP stated?
---
Imo we need 4 options.. serves that stay as is forever, servers that restart, servers that progress to TBC and beyond and servers that progress into classis plus. Incredibly unlikely but it would make everyone happy. As long as the playerbase is large enough and cost is reasonable it could work.
---
Deep diving into this topic just raises more and more questions..
---
This is the correct answer and confirmed on beta. Private servers had it wrong.
---
&gt; Question for other Priests with info of vanilla pvp servers.
---
&gt; I’m going to be rolling a troll and doing a lot in shadow spec, is it worth moving points into blackout for the shadowguard stun or should I just stick to the typical talent set while leveling?
---
troll priest is very good for blackout esp. since you get the lightning shield kinda ability as a troll priest racials. it can get procced of that
---
Confirmed to be #3 on the beta.
---
"It's the same as a PvP server but all the risk vs reward is removed"
---
For fun, kinda roleplayish as OP stated?
---
I love all of you
---
&gt; private servers have quite a few things wrong in their raids that make things considerably easier, especially related to tanking.
---
Any examples?
---
People are reporting that hamstring kiting does not work because of leeway. So how do you come to the conclusion that leeway doesn't apply for slow targets?
---
Well, that makes it a pretty good talent then :D
---
I'm rolling a female Nelf Warrior if the name I want stays available. Shadowmeld charge is just too fun.
---
I think youll be quite disappointed.
---
Divinity Original Sin 2. Made an elf sub rogue, a human deathknight, dwarf warrior tank, skeleton archer.
---
 Very good game to pass the time, and you can make whatever class you want to play in Classic with near identical abilities.
---
The gold standard is the tribute ogre suit and elixir of giant growth on a AQ bug mount.
---
It is multiplicative with the Bear form bonus.
---
Do you want a medal? Cookie?
---
Meanwhile i subbed for beta, got in hours later, didnt play. Sorry people.
---
I'm having so much trouble convincing myself its ok to make a male dwarf rogue. Their combat and stealth animations are just so ugly and boring.
---
&gt;Have people even here played classic when it was around? You’re not going to make friends with everyone; just a core group of players.
---
Did you play Vanilla? Cause I did and made most of my friends while LEVELING. Perhaps i'm in a zone with another player that could have been a new friend but I never ran across him or played/quested with him because we were never on the same layer even though we were always within the same level range.
---
Vanilla was a SOCIAL game and you make friends in tons of ways but you need to be able to speak to other players. It's funny how everything is social networks nowadays but everyone is afraid to talk to each other. I played some retail recently and NOBODY talks to each other. Save some guy from dying? You won't even get some much as a "thanks" or "fuck off I clearly had that by myself".
---
&gt; will go away after the first month
---
Said no Blizzard dev ever. Ion said they MIGHT remove it early than phase 2 but this is all dependent on Classic not being that successful or not enough players. Blizzard thinks we will have a massive influx of players then a mass exodus back to retail. This is how blizzard is going to remove layering, going from multiple full layers to a single layer for what remains. If the servers stay full they will be unable to remove layering.
---
Layering is not a bad thing but when it extends into contested zones it's not good. Everyone already knows it's going to be abused in dozens of ways.
---
If they were in 1.12, should be in the game. Can't see why it wouldnt be
---
Not true. Shamans don't get really good until Aq40
---
Thanks and yeah I like this fluid game style. I am not a "melee Hunter should only melee" guy I'd like to use both, with focus on melee and want to know what's possible. It just feels right for me. And my main is going to be a priest so I want something to have fun with as a twink
---
What made them look bad? Asking as future tank
---
Carried over from what WC3?
---
That’s honestly fine for even semi-hardcore guilds. 15-30 hours a week is plenty of time to get a baseline amount of consumables. If you join a “casual” guild you’ll be better than 90% of the people there. I’d honestly aim a little higher, the fact that you’re even thinking about preparing for raid means you aren’t casual.
---
I don't really care about what someone reverse engineered, which is speculative at best. I'm telling you how it works right now.
---
MS+ deathwish ultra feelsgoodman
---
See bald guys can pull way out of their league if they got muscles.
---
Every comment/post you've made about Layering has got to be the dumbest shit i've ever heard. I'm so glad you don't work for Blizzard.
---
The Leaf quests were so much fun. Having to kite the demons for a long time until they were dead. I just miss the challenge of this game.

---
Finding a guild where everyone's friendly enough that everyone's happy with loot council is fucking gold. I would rather bankrupt myself in repair bills with friendly noobs than worldfirst with DKP drama.
---
Youve never played classic before, pretty clear to see.
---
Faction and server type. Horde PVE guilds are lacking.
---
crazyyyy
---
If enough people think this, and spread this, OP lvl 19 Hunter twinks won't dominate wsg!
---
And then you started raiding and saved the world every 2 days while having your (or a guildies) name shouted out loud in the capital city as å champion for saving the world from a dragon menace.
---
Whats up with hunters?
---
Ya your right.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw-6xn745SI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw-6xn745SI)
---
Come bring this up to the classic Druid discord and you’ll find the consensus is quite the contrary.
---
Titan Panel representing. I can't play Classic without that bar. That bar is home.
---
the biggest impact will be threat generation for tanks, which affects all raid dps. Once your raiders all get gear, the issue isn’t usually bad performance on your dps, it’s that you’re throttled by your tank’s TPS. So with a 14% parry, it’s gonna be less than the private server 8% has conditioned people to be. 
---
Until your tanks gets thunderfury. Then threat won’t be an issue
---
Depends on raid but this is not really an issue. Respecs are very common in vanilla
---
It was Blizzards fault, mostly. Nobody really knew about what everything did and hunters made use of all stats so most thought it was ok. Everyone didn't know to stack stat X. Blizzard could have put something on the items that said, recommended for class X but they did nothing and let everyone figure it out themselves. The game constantly had new players so it kept on going all throughout the game.
---
On top of that, it’s also nice that the heroes of the RTS are more or less side characters in Classic as well. We aren’t helping Thrall take down Deathwing, because he’s too busy dealing with politics in Orgrimmar. We aren’t helping Jaina deal with Kel'Thuzad, because she’s too busy dealing with issues in Theramore.
---
It’s things like that that make the world feel like *yours*. I can rummage around Nazjatar all I want, but I’m still Jaina’s glorified sidekick. But when I’m adventuring through the Barrens, or Thousand Needles, or the Hinterlands, or wherever, I’m on my own journey.
---
Things I will miss from retail:
---
The abundance of RPG elements
---
SLASH ESSSSSS
---
Itemization/Version is 1.12. But content is release progressively. 
---
That said we don't really know. They have be less than clear on quests/quest hubs.
---
I doubt they'll be in at the start. I'd expect them at AQ or Naxx phase.
---
Naxx was still awesome at lvl 80 and I consider my Immortal title to be my greatest wow achievement to this day. Fuck that last fight with KT when we were on 0 deaths for the week was TENSE.
---
There will always be that one asshat(normally a hunter or rogue) that pulls sub dps but swears he's the best in the guild.
---
I think it was hinted at, yeah.
---
In non-movie lore, they did the nasty and had a kid together that we don't talk about.
---
What was healing like compared to more modern healing? I never really played seriously until right before WoD and fell in love with healing. If I like healing a lot more than DPS in modern WoW would I probably feel the same about Classic?
---
Hmmm we are rollign Alliance PvP but there are a bunch of guilds (horde pve) recruiting on the Classic WoW Guilds Discord
---
choices make people lose interests as it dilutes the playerbase and the only thing that's hyping classic right now is the streamers
---
It has the stage at the moment
---
The only why-not I can think of is server volumes after the tourists drop out.
---
i think you misunderstood. i was healing in a feral spec, which was pretty much identical to healing in restoration after they changed Innervate to all druids. Rejuvenation didn't stack then, either, and i didn't have the gear to actually use Rejuvenation, so, i could only spam Rank 4/9 HT... which i could've done as Resto.
---
I bought the last physical copy of BFA at my local Best Buy. I'm keeping the box in case it's the last xpac sold in stores.
---
Man, getting full tiers is gonna be so easy if everyone stops playing hunter!
---
I was on that server and remember that guild name. Could’ve been in it. I switched guilds a couple times. Always loved that name. The best meeting spot in game.
---
You are correct good sir!
---
demons are fine, blood is iffy but gets censored or turned a different color then red most of the time.
---
Chinese gov specifically bans ghosts, skeletons, symbols of death, etc. The government has a ban on religion and literally reincarnation. Anything to do with death or the afterlife is censored.
---
I expect the same amount of damage as vanilla. It'll be fine.
---
Laaame. Feral tanks are required end game &amp; great at PvP, ele Shamans and hunters are imba DPS.
---
you never played vanilla it seems and it shows
---
yous a meme bro
---
tell everyone who you were on this picture
---
Blizzard started favoring melee classes in WoD and onwards. Playing a caster in BFA pvp feels like torture. And then switching back to melee feels glorious.
---
Hunters had no problem in Vanilla. More Pserver crybabies claiming their shitty Pserver was correct and blizz isn't. LOL
---
The people that are really aggressive on loot are usually the fastest to leave.  If they want the loot that bad, you think they will stick around with your guild after you give them the weapons they want?  Never trust those people.
---
What happens if you swap the order to have the Call Pet check first?
---
/cast [nopet] Call Pet; [@pet,dead] Revive Pet; [@pet,nodead] Mend Pet
---
So the big question is, for us 0/30/21 druid tanks out there, what's better: Thick Hide (mitigation) or Feral Instinct (Threat)?
---
1. Choice and consequence. 
---
2. Let’s not pretend retail doesn’t have toxicity. 
---
3. It would be cool, but kinda out of place. Plenty of other grinds to do. 
---
4. Choice and consequence. 
---
5. Choice and consequence.

6.  Choice and consequence.

---
If guild goes to raid AQ40 and Naxx, then its not casual anymore pretty much. :P
---
It sounds like it could be fun, kinda roleplayish and PvP oriented
---
I'm so happy that this sub is filled with a lot of knee-jerk reactions. This will weed out the dramatic people who think that Blizzard will never fix bugs for Classic, which in turn, for hunters specifically, will mean even less huntards to crowd the servers.
---
At this point, I'd argue it's a deliberate move by Blizzard, to make sure only people who actually want to play hunter, play the class.

I mean I use a bag addon to make my inventory one giant bag (technically more immersive than imagining a guy with 5 backpacks on) and even one to show me the vendor price of items but I still sort it/manage it myself and I love having tons of shit to move around between alts. It's not vastly different in retail the issue is more that plus all the other conveniences combined result in less of an RPG feel. 
---
I'm a big fan of the Diablo and Resident Evil style inventories as well.
---
&gt; The extra 2.66 yards is only active when BOTH targets are MOVING.
---
Not true, as evidenced by this video in which only the caster is moving (jumping, actually): https://clips.twitch.tv/BlitheOptimisticLatteAllenHuhu
---
Locks quality of life matches with healthstones, soulstones &amp; pet... Hunters are so OP they get a similar quality of life for existing.

ISWALKING isn't ISSLOWED

Walk is an actual toggle.

So not casual

You could say dwarf for duelling rogues/warriors, and gnome for duelling mages/druids - I think that's fair enough. In group pvp though roots/snares are much more of a problem then vanish/blind reset, and EA is on a 1min cd compared with 3min SF, so gnome is vastly superior in group combat (ie bgs) even if it just breaks even with dwarf in duels.
---
[That actually happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MzqS1tCh-0)

Oh it might actually be that low. For these really low droprate items the droprate are usually just bad guesses.

&gt;For foreign-made films, this sometimes means controversial footage must be cut before such films can play in Chinese cinemas. Examples include the removal of a reference to the Cold War in Casino Royale, and the omission of footage containing Chow Yun-fat that "vilifies and humiliates the Chinese" in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, the PRC administration announced that "wronged spirits and violent ghosts, monsters, demons, and other inhuman portrayals" were banned from audio visual content.

That's a weird wah to draw Ironforge.
---
Thank you for this, /r/classicwow
---
It gets really funny when everyone thinks the same thing, so you’ve got the warlock standing there waiting for someone to help summon the others and four random guys out questing waiting for a summon.
---
&gt;At 400 people though its not really a guild its more like a chat channel with people you want to mute from your own guild.
---
I had at least one time where a raid leader messaged asking me to unmute a someone who was trying to talk to me.
---
First of all you know that hamstring kiting doesn't work well because of leeway that should be the first clue, the second clue should be that that is a variable and not a function, do you really think every time a slow is applied some function is called to set some variable that indicates that you are slowed?
---
If I had to take a guess that variable differentiates between the walking and running you can toggle with a keybind.
---
Unless you were my brother and his friends who intermittently whispered "kill your parents" on Ventrilo while the raid leaders shouted, demanding to know who was interrupting during a boss fight.
---
"CLERICS CAMP"
---
It's got more integration for all sorts of pc games, it's easier to set up different chats, you can call someone directly or set up a voice chat room, sharing links and pictures is more streamlined, you can videochat/screen share, *and* it has loading screens that reference pop culture and dank memes
---
Leeway is supposed to be a pvp mechanic so I don't even why you bringing up pve.
---
Are the people who get lots of raid gear going to pvp with me.
---
There's a small chance cc breaks on damage every tic.
---
Second monitors can run the discord. I don’t do it this way, but I see my 16 year old son do it all the time.
---
You can't create Horde and Alliance characters on the same PVP server. Do you really think people deleted their Alliance beta characters just to mess with the tournament for one day?
---
Ooooooh yeah!  Shadowmeld charge is the best pvp skill / racial combo in all of wow
---
Exactly, the challenge is finding those extra 20 (sorry not 15) quality people.  And keep them also!  Keep in mind that gearing up is more challenging in Vanilla.  Just when you get a 40 man roster going, 2 people quit and take a bunch of uber rare drops with them.  Your guild is only going to get so many Thunderfuries (if any) and Neltharion's Tears.  If those 2 items were given Item Level scores they would be off the charts.  On the warlock Vanilla spreadsheet the DPS difference between Tear and the 2nd best trinket is Rrrrreeeee-diculous.  Logistical nightmare for sure.
---
Fishing and cooking are both skills I plan on gaining eventually. That fishing can offer some niche edge for 2h weapon wielders while leveling is equal parts hilarious and motivational to me.
---
Strong Fishing Pole -10s
---
2 nightcrawlers -2s
---
Beating to death level 20 troggs for the Dwarvish army with a fishing pole(45 skill) at level 13 -Priceless
---
If anyone in Beta wants to confirm this isn't as ridiculous as it seems, please let me know your findings. 50/50 chance come launch I'll be a fishing pole samurai or the idiot paladin corpse.
---
You thought you did... But you didn't...

---
Oh wow, I did not hear that.  Great news for Bear tanks for sure.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
at least there won't be as many huntards thinking Nightblade is a hunterweapon. or whatever it is. It's a boe epic dagger in Vanilla
---
Threat if MT/Mitigation if OT. 
---
As long as you are not dying.... do more threat.
---
I agree with you and OP that we need to for sure know blizzards intentions up front. 
---
That said, I don't think that having rp people play on a pvp server would lead to a smaller server. If anything I think that server would end up being more populated than the other servers due to the concentrated rp community deciding to play there.
---
&gt;the more i research about this material is that there was a golden rule of only the skinner getting it during the ubrs run
---
Ya, until it actually dropped then you'd have people not in the group messaging about how they should be able to roll on it. The sane people sided with the skinner, the assholes tried to get their way into rolling on it.
---
So basically what your saying is now tauren is new pvp meta. I knew my old bessie would shine through one day. Love my female tauren she thiccc
---
So it seems I don’t need more that 2?
---
You're looking for balance spec forgoing moonkin form.
---
&gt;Regrowth early on is a major buff to keep up on the tank, 
---
It just costs so much mana. It definitely isn't worth it just for the buff (the hot portion)
---
Going to reply in sections because holy wall of text. 
---
Locks(aff in perticular) have always ranked up in power due to their heavy reliance on secondary stats such as haste and crit. A few haste can mean the difference in 6 or 7 corruption ticks drastically increasing its dps per cast. 
---
Locks bring cookies and soul stones as utility but usually are left behind in damage because the only debuff they can apply on bosses is usually a curse, which shadowpriests can also apply a shadow debuff increasing all locks and their own dps if the raid allows. 
---
Shadow priests might require a ton of farming for raid materials but a lock will always spend more time soulshard farming then a priest will farm for consumables. 
---
I agree with you on most parts but in vanilla locks were not anywhere near as in demand as a mage. When a really good caster piece drops, most likely it’s going to a mage.
---
becomes?
---
Know any good vanilla druid pvp YouTube channels?
---
Over the time of 3 years I've been in a world top 100 and in a world top 10 guild so this comes from a purely progression orientated perspective:  
---
No females age 14-40, potential for huge drama.  
---
Strict rules for raids. You are too late? Minus dkp. You are afk while standby? 0 standby dkp. 
---
Everyone who wants to leave at raid ending time is free to leave. 
---
Everyone has to know the boss mechanics and has to have every consumable needed for his class before raids begin.  
---
Basically if you delay the raid in any way you could have avoided you get punished accordingly. This is very important if you want to keep raids as productive as possible, you will save alot of time per night, week, month. Motivation of the "strongest/best" members will stay high, less leaves for better guilds result in better atmosphere. If a raid goes too clowny, your raid underperforms, you need a raid leader to be very clear about consequences etc(like all raids canceled for the week, for players that want progression this is very bad consequence), don't just let it be. 
---
Get class leaders who know their class very well and let them handle players with their class. Listen to class leaders. Probably more but that's all I can remember right now.
---
If you wanted a pvp levelling spec I'd take blackout just fine. I'd take it over shadow reach (only 6% a point ugh) and only 3pts shadow focus (6% is plenty for all pvp and nearly every levelling pve situation). There's your 5 pts for blackout which will help immensely pvp'ing vs warr/rogue/hunter while levelling as a troll.
---
Play human and cap it at 6% ggwp. End of story ;)
---
This was back when it actually cost money to host a voice server.  So someone in the guild was actually paying out of pocket to have a large enough server to get at least 40 people in to at the very least listen to what was being said.
---
Not really a concern these days with Discord and such, but it was sort of a big deal back then.  Fun times when the guy who hosted the Vent server and/or guild website would quit and you show up to raid and have to bum onto a friendly guilds Vent for the night because yours got turned off.
---
OP did in fact ONLY mention rp pvp and discuss how that is the "best" WoW experience in his opinion. 
---
I replied to your comment because you were curious why folks were downvoting the idea and I think that singling out rp-pvp and not pvp as well is a part of it.
---
Hell yeah I'm going to be the first disc tank! I mean, they even put a trinket for us inside BWL!
---
You must have a weak memory. I played a mage not too long ago, on VANILLA, not retail. 
---
Let me educate you, in pvp you'll get rekt if you're not frost kid, KEK
---
he won't be MT with a hybrid spec.
---
It's literally a mechanic made for pvp, why would it work in pve?
---
Druids were the least popular class in Vanilla if memory serves. And if you're looking for healing, you'll probably have no trouble finding a spot as a result. You'll probably have a slightly easier time finding gear as a druid too.
---
Not that Resto Shaman will be getting turned away at the door, mind.
---
ur seeking a narrative at this point then, since you're looking past a really fun, enjoyable, popular event just to see the bad of people griefing because it was streamed
---
Warrior with guild, Rogue without.
---
So if I’m reading this right two should be enough
---
He is correctly adding the +100% base value.
---
Getting people to read them was half the problem... The player base was, as a whole, a lot worse at the game than they are now.
---
When I was raiding MC and BWL we didn't really have optimised guides, we went on rumours and trial and error.
---
Here's something you WON'T have to miss from retail:
---
People disappearing in front of you and phasing in and out.
---
I had a look at the 1.14 patch notes, it will make tauren melee range infinite, if you can target something you can hit it from anywhere by swinging in the air.
---
From all accounts it says pvp, and all the footage I've seen of leeway is in pvp and all the footage i've seen of vanilla PVE did not have leeway.
---
The guard is a little odd but OMG so beautiful
---
Can I hit people in other layers too?
---
There will be no open beta.
---
I had like 10 pals in the guild I usually hang out with.
---
During raid everything was serious and we would focus.
---
Locks, Druids, Priests, Pallies
---
Nice humblebrag
---
It's called clearing all content in 1 night
---
I think 70% slow or greater removes the leeway effect.
---
Pretty sure that is what Ayle the mage player found.
---
This is the thing. I will kill you if I find you, but I don't actually care. Just avoid me after the first time, and you are fine.
---
Well, I'm pretty sure the default settings is an open mic, so you actually have to turn PTT on.  I could be wrong, but from years of doing arenas/smaller group activities, I haven't used PTT in any voice chat in about 10-12 years.
---
I hate myself for hoping this happens with my guild. I missed out on the details of the girl who broke the heart of half my old guild
---
You are awesome, you aren’t dumb
---
cope
---
I can never not push to talk. I'm gonna start humming to myself or something stupid.
---
I heard that is coming in 1.15, you will be able to hit an entire layer damaging everyone in it, all you need to do is right click report the layer for toxic behaviour.
---
Can you do top 50 of each class? I plan to be one of the first to 60, but ill be a warrior.
---
You got him dude. You must be quite the intellectual.
---
I thought you could set the threshold as raid leader.
---
Yeah let's ignore the ranged zero CD instant cast 20% mortal strike
---
Will it proc thunderfury on all targets hit?
---
The grandiosity of wrath and onwards wow is part of what killed it for me on top of everything else. I prefer being a random adventurer developing as a journeyman.
---
Probably.  And to be clear I don't want all mythic raiders to fail.  I just have read a lot of derisive comments about the ease of Vanilla mechanics.  As someone who has been in guilds struggling through Vanilla it pisses me off (I've been in highly successful guilds also).  The challenges of Vanilla are more logistical (40 people with a chance to wipe the raid vs 20), but that gets swept under the rug as if it doesn't matter.
---
C'thun's chain lightning is a relatively easy mechanic.  But 40 people running into his room as opposed 20 people running into the same room is night and day.  On paper the mechanic looks easy.  Dealing with it with double the normal raid force is quite different.  That is why I used running into his room as the example.
---
If not having fade causes a wipe I'd take that as a bonus for letting me know there's no point continuing with that group.
---
Live to win!
---
This is what happens when you put auto attack on 1
---
Do you have any evidence? Not only did you reply to a blue post that it is working as intended
---
But here's evidence of a guy referencing the actual source code https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8eg81/to_all_of_those_who_claim_melee_leeway_wasnt_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Without evidence you sound as stubborn as a flat-eather
---
One of the great aspects to Rexar was I still remember after all these years the long hunt to find him for the Onyxia attument quest. While it was frustrating at the time, those moments where something requires more effort make them memorable, if he had been pinpointed on the map I doubt I'd even remember having to go to him as part of the chain.

You'll just die in the graveyard where his friends are camping.

I used the same specs for PvE and PvP the entire time I played Vanilla.  The trade offs made things interesting.

Point he tried to make is that people will kite enhancer to the moon and back, because the average skill level is much higher.

 Cool thanks
---
Good sold GM with an officer core who supports him to the hilt.
---
Took me weeks to kill them, especially the ungoro one. 
---
Actually it was especially all of them, had my best friend on his warlock help me with the silithus one (imp fire shield), guildie hunter helped me with ungoro (thanks again, Extilor) and my CL showed me how to do burning steppes (Velociraptor you were a real MVP). Winterspring demon was just an exercise in patience, managed it finally with a random who ran ahead of me and kited anything I might aggro after weeks of dying to it.
---
I still xmog it today, but since wotlk hunter hasn't felt the same so I never mained it again. 120 days played in 2005 and 2006.
---
Required Feral tanks? For who? We cleared BWL and never had a feral tank. We had 2 druids or so, but they were healing/utility.
---
I’m all for “play what you want”, but telling someone that feral is required in raids is blatantly false, and I wouldn’t want to give someone that idea. It’s not fair to them
---
I never PvPd as a Gnome Mage but Escape Artist doesn't get enough credit, IMO.
---
Here's the deal as far as I understand it.
---
1) The only information available about this is whatever we can in the freaking *comment section* on Reddit from people who clearly hold a grudge against TipsOut.
---
2) That, and from some sketchy news sites. 
---
We basically don't know the circumstances on this. *Certainly* not enough to judge a persons character on this.
---
**Secondly:** Why should anyone care about this? It doesn't matter. If he owes a huge debt to society why in the hell should you prevent him from paying back? That's like kicking a person while he's down. What the fuck, mate.
---
If I cant bring myself to go to the gym I imagine a tauren warrior with his massive physique and then I go anyways!
---
I... was... pure... once.
---
This discussion was primarily getting an answer to the grey area that blizzard has left.
---
Also I mean you acting like your are now is roleplaying as we all roleplay in real life as im sure you change how you act to different people like parent's, mentors, bosses etc.
---
That’s what I tell people as well. I have so much fun just doing story stuff since I’m a huge fan of the franchise.
---
Druids are Top healers in RBGS.. Priests are great but Druids always topping charts. 
---
Priests just havent been that good since 8.1
---
It was WoD that really was the final straw for me.
---
Vanilla - I was an adventurer.
---
TBC - I am part of the assault force upon Outland; I mean sure. I've done enough to warrant that.
---
WotLK - Survived Outland so of course they'd send me to Northrend.
---
Cataclysm - No rest for the wicked; Deathwing is up to no good.
---
MoP - I suppose I've earned enough acclaims to be part of the initial strike force on Pandaria. 
---
WoD - Alright, listen: I never raided in vanilla or TBC, I never got past the plagueworks in Icecrown citadel and I quit before Deathwing. I came back to deal with Garrosh. Why the fuck are you making me commander? I have not in any way earned this. I'm sure there are players who have: but I have not.
---
They have already said RP type servers will be present and RP/PvE appears to be confirmed as per classic beta/stress test stuff if i remember correctly.
---
I cant say much about recent expansions as i switched from healing to dps after wrath but as a priest healing in vanilla was very simple tbh, you mostly only used flash heals, renews and prayer of healing.
---
In TBC you started getting more defined talent trees and disc became more about stopping dmg, holy about healing dmg up.
---
In wrath disc priests got penance which was awesome but also power word shield was very strong. The class really started becoming fun to play i think from wrath and beyond.
---
I can only say that in vanilla the priest was a strong pick if not the strongest for healer role but it suffered like many other classes limitations from the poor talent trees (Lightwell 31 holy talent was awful) so as such there wasnt really much flexability.
---
Our rogue is Special, but we treat him like everyone else
---
I'd argue that roleplayers are less likely to be weeb's because i mean warcraft is heavily based on western culture thus the PvPer's are actually more likely to be weeb's as their void isn't filled with warcraft culture. :P
---
1. Not sure how many of these you expect to have.
---
2. Named mob respawns are really fast. Yeah, it's a social game, so some people will be assholes. That's part of socializing.
---
3. WoW is already a fossil
---
4. You don't have to be a cutting edge tryhard if you don't want to, the game is old enough to drive
---
5. Everything has its niche
---
6. Versatility tax; character choices need to be sticky and impactful
---
Oh in a larger channel/group sure, but if its like sub 10 people, its staying open.  I can just slap the mute button on the side of my headset or just push my mic up and it automutes if my kids start going wild in the background or something.
---
In reality its more than 50%, because you just get countered a lot more.   
---
So much can happen in a 3second cast, it's unreal.
---
Fuck collections and all the stupid vanity mounts they out in retail so much. Especially heirlooms.
---
Move up the shadow tree, to get imp swp and reduced shadow resistance, by the time you hit 40 just get shadow form
---
Maturity, honestly.
---
I used to play a bunch with Sol, I forget his priest name but he was a Female Priest, Disc, then later in Raiding Shadow.
---
We started playing other games before WoW.
---
Always wondered how he's doing.
---
Sorry, not interested in the rat race. I play games to get away from that shit
---
From the super mages I know from pservers they value gnome higher than undead. Though how much of it is simply due to ally vs horde and how much is racials I dunno.
---
&gt; The second one is made of older people, who probably have jobs, kids, wifes or girlfriends, don't have as much time to dedicate to games anymore, or simply people who don't enjoy the hardcore playstile and rather just enjoy themselves.  
---
Because I can't want to raid 3 nights a week and also have a wife that I spend time with.
---
&gt;Perhaps i'm in a zone with another player that could have been a new friend but I never ran across him or played/quested with him because we were never on the same layer even though we were always within the same level range.
---
This is an empty argument and the same thing can be said about multiple non-layered servers:
---
"Hei maybe that one person from another server that is in the same level range and zone as me could have been my friend but we will never know cause he is in a different server and I never got to meet him."
---
Infact with layering you will have more oportunities to meet new people simply because the pool of players on one layered server is potentially bigger than a non-layered server.
---
&gt;Vanilla was a SOCIAL game and you make friends in tons of ways but you need to be able to speak to other players. 
---
It's not like the game will be empty with layering. You will still meet people and you will still have plety of opportunities to talk to them.
---
&gt;If the servers stay full they will be unable to remove layering.
---
That's a big IF right there. But IF the servers stay full they can always go back to plan B and slap a queue on that server and offer free transfers. Just like they did so many times in the past including Vanilla. Layering doesn't have to stay in any way.
---
&gt;Layering is not a bad thing but when it extends into contested zones it's not good. Everyone already knows it's going to be abused in dozens of ways.
---
I actually agree with you here. This is the only facet of layering I really dislike. And I really hope they fix it come launch.
---
I love it
---

I did mention my personal feelings correct - but primarily this thread is to promote blizzard answering the grey area that is currently RP-PvP can you just give us the final clarification.
---
Your loss I guess
---
I don't know the amount but there was a portion of time when you could farm honor in a druid group doing this over and over that was on the old blizzhackers site.
---
Yea all I had to go off of was wowhead at the time and that's what they were listing. It's a good point
---
it is not fixable via addons.
---
There is not a single boss.
---
Thinking about it more, I'm wondering if part of the reason could also be they don't have to deal with bless of freedom from pallies?
---
But then again, gotta deal with grounding totems from shaman then right?  But, BoF on a warrior could be a real PITA.
---
My casual raiding guild 2 raid nights a week: MC and Ony.  3 hour max. No required attendance.  Other raids like ZG were done as pickup groups scheduled everyone once in a while within the guild.  Once we entered BWL, we had 3 raids a week, but once we started rolling BWL, MC got put on pickup group status.  Similar thing when we started AQ40.
---
We didn't make it to through AQ40 before BC hit, so maybe it wasn't a viable model, but we had a good time doing it.
---
And the gorillas in the Chasing Am-E cave drop barrels, like Donkey Kong.
---
You know you could've played on any of the tens of private servers that happened between 2010 and now, like the rest of us, and you would've had your answer.
---
This is false.
---
I think we have all known a man like that... lol
---
Because after he was finally caught and his company shut down for good he came on to this subreddit to promote his own personal Patreon and would probably do it again the next time he needs some money. So him warning people that TipsOut is a scam artist so they can avoid being scammed in the future is completely reasonable.
---
Welp it won't be me.  I debated for a while, but I took off Friday and Monday after Classic releases, so I'll only get to play for a couple hours each night until Friday, when all bets are off and I hit delirium from lack of sleep.
---
Dear god I hope so.
---
Sometimes even 1 Monstet can make me feel weird and noticably  lose coordination of my thoughts. I can't imagine drinking 3-6 monsters a day, Jesus

Private server =/= custom client. Private servers use Blizzard's own client. It's the server software that is custom built.

Tauren warrior is literally a ranged dps.
---
This is how I feel, racing doesn't seem fun to me
---
Combabulator?
---
Yeah, definitely. I add it to all the "activate damage macros" :)
---
Laughable.
---
ally mages on pservers have been spoiled, it's been the easiest class in the game due to grounding totem barely working and WF undoubtely looking weaker. Beta has shown shamans WHOOPS mages.
---
I played Priest as my main in vanilla. Barely used that bloody wand. I really don't know what all the rage about it is.
---
The respec thing is huge for me. Healers wear alot of +heal gear, which is worthless solo farming, which everyone is going to have to do unless you buy gold.
---
 Respeccing should be much cheaper imo. Healers should be able to switch to dps on offnights to farm.
---
Mana definitely comes into play in pvp so that’s another pro to gnomes. Do you have random bgs or premade more in mind?
---
Lucifron with a full t1 group can take less than 15 seconds to kill.
---
Many guilds used it in Naxx, as bosses like Patchwerk destroyed prot warriors.
---
AQ was also a good time to be feral.
---
While you may have cleared BWL, there was much harder content than that.
---
2 weeks to down him seems pretty low unless you were in a top 100 guild or something :)
---
To copy from BFA, copy config-cache.wtf and bindings-cache.wtf from
---
    \World of Warcraft\_retail\_\WTF\Account\[account#]\
---
to
---
    \World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\[account#]\ 
---
Then copy Config.wtf from and to the respective \WTF\ folders in the same fashion.
---
FREE EPIX
---
Yes, this works :)
---
Thanks man!
---
Your character actually changes to a walking animation if slowed enough. It checks for that animation. Not just the toggle.
---
Vanilla WoW is a casual game. Raided casually in vanilla and cleared everything up to AQ40 doing the minimum amount of work. Basically just had all my enchantments done and maybe a few consumables like fire resistance pots for Ragnaros in MC (I don't even think you need these for that fight but it was w/e). The raids aren't hard at all, it's mostly just about getting everyone online and into the raid. 
---
I think you might be over-analyzing raiding in vanilla and perhaps giving the "experts" who spout that you *have* to do this or that or the other thing just to raid. Their mentality comes from them playing the same game for years on end; they've figured out everything, so all that was left was to push it to the limit basically (i.e. speed running), which involves the massive amount of grind time for every consumable possible and taking even more time to pick up every single world buff available before stepping foot into the raid. Not saying this playstyle is wrong, if people wanna do that, that's fine, but when they go about telling everyone who asks about raiding that they *have* to do all this it's just false.
---
I'm like you in terms of I like the challenge and I like becoming more skilled, but I'm not hardcore at all. I do the best I can when I'm playing, but I refuse to do the boring shit just to eek out like 5% more DPS, healing, or survivability because it's just not worth it to me, especially because it's not needed to down content in vanilla. I'd rather get in there with my buds and actually do something and fuck around in chat rather than go grind some shit in a remote corner of the world for hours on end, travel everywhere to get world buffs, etc.
---
If you're a decent human being with a decent understanding of the game and the raid's mechanics you will get a raid spot. That simple really.
---
You rate them by quality?
---
Please delete this. This is my plan. I have a spread sheet set up already for what is bis at the twink brackets.
---
Starting with one that didn’t require as much is smart to get feedback on non-content related areas like pacing, etc. I’m about to drive but I’m gonna watch it later
---
Glad to help!
---
It doesn't even keep retail at 120+ on Max so I wasn't sure
---
I didn't know that was possible. Maybe then
---
I've been playing WoW since open beta, save your speech for people who might actually buy the bullshit that vanilla WoW is a hardcore game, when in reality it's the opposite.
---
He's not a freaking scam artist. He is making actual content. You can think some of that content is shit, I do, but it's not a scam.
---
The game mechanics are different from Bfa so logically it should be ground zero. Shaman is the most keybind instensive class in Vanilla btw, so have fun.
---
That's true. I was just having a fun dig though tbh heh. :p
---
As a 60 shadow priest you can take the back door into Uldaman, pop an invisibility potion and down the first boss I seem to recall. All in a few mins. Then just cycle that. Best if you've an enchanted and disenchant the drops.
---
You sound like the type of player that my guild is looking for. Shoot me a pm if you'd like some details.
---
I agree with you, clarification via a hard "yes" or hard "no" would be helpful! Also as another commenter pointed out, it would suck if pvp rp'ers all rolled on the same server and afterwards migrated to a pvp-rp server if one opened down the road.
---
I said nothing about removing layering posts. I said, this *joke* post probably should be removed because it's off-topic/a joke, but I left it, and noni await other joke posts to be removed and then people being upset.
---
Seconded, I played on Ravenholdt-EU during classic and whilst I transferred off at the launch of TBC, my best memories are still on that server. I’ve always found the community to be a lot nicer on RP servers and classic is best played on a PvP server so I would be pretty disappointed if there wasn’t a server that would give me the best of both worlds.
---
It may move that slow but it doesn't toggle run off.
---
Lvl40 is hardly enough to show what mage vs shaman looks like and from the looks of it grounding totem is scuffed as hell on the beta aswell as elemental mastery.
---
Or just /w them. Works on classic and on pservers. Don't need to go so far out of your way to have another character.
---
&gt; Beta has shown shamans WHOOPS mages.
---
Yea, no doubt about that.  But won't most of them be resto?  I guess not in PvP.  I imagine a lot of them would have a hard time getting gear for an offspec.  Isn't that how vanilla kind of works? Enh and Ele are like meme specs for raiding from what I understand?
---
yeah you literally type
---
Into a macro, then drag that macro icon to your bar like a spell. A lot of these work in retail if you want to test them
---
no you get the same 2.66 flat added, it's just added ontop. They don't get a "more" multiplier.
---
Right click reporting you for toxicity!
---
Wotf is a no brainer. That said, gnome is the best race for mage.
---
Crusader Kings, Mordhau
---
The wand stuff is so over rated. I'd just play and find a wand naturally via a drop or whatever.
---
Speaking of making me want to kill myself reading.......
---
Well, I have a 16 year old so I am obviously not too young. Second monitors are seeming to be more normal. Good monitors aren’t too expensive now a days.

---
Just because it's a sandbox doesn't mean it doesn't have progression. Granted it's not as linear as wow, but nobody is going to give a shit about a boss that drops a t65 weapon when they can breeze past it by afking for a couple of days so they can start on barrows/gwd eventually moving to endgame which is CoX/corp/ToB
---
Yes like every other talent tree in classic it's part of the BIS paradigm where you have one optimal choice and many bad choices.
---
These types of people are scum. Do what others say, just jump on an alt and do some crafting, fishing, etc.  The only time wasted is their own.
---
Yes but that is a DIFFERENT character saving the world, not the same one that did it 2 days ago.
---
I know its tempting to ostracize females b/c of the drama potential....but.....I don't know how to put this exactly....thats....not correct. You have to treat it on a case by case, like any other raider.
---
That's OK, we're on 1.12
---
Maybe improved VW talents might buy an extra second?
---
True EA would come in handy in group pvp, but so would Wotf. It's one thing to say fear is easy to be dispelled, it's another to have a dispeller around willing to spend a global on a mage.  
---
It's close for sure. WotF is more powerful (being feared is a lot worse than being slowed as a mage), but 1min CD is obviously much better than 2 min CD.
---
&gt; Agility gives you zero melee power but it does give crit
---
1 agi is 1 melee AP and 2 ranged AP.
---
I guess you are considering overall with intellect bonus? I suppose I should also consider that in my decision.
---
its for the stress test , beta ends in a week anyway
---
That's why you have alt(s)
---
Yes. You're now a certified beta player. Congrats buddy.
---
You should join us at r/wowcirclejerk
---
We're a sub that reposts quality contributions from this sub and r/wow
---
Private channels &amp; talking shit allowed me to continue raiding through most of Classic, BC &amp; WotLK. 
---
Being invited into another spec's channel was a particularly nice badge of honor -- being that one caster in the melee group / healer chat and watching them bash on the rest of your class/role was always fun.
---
Having a fake sob story about how you need money because you just got laid off to promote your Patreon when you really need the money because you helped run a fraudulent construction company that was just shut down and have millions of dollars in legal bills is a scam. 
---
Monkeynews got into the Beta because his account is from 2006 and had literally nothing to do with Tips, but even if he did so what? I'm sure OJ Simpson has helped a lot of people in his life, but if he came here posting a link to his Patreon with a sob story would you say it was a vendetta if somebody said "hey you guys probably shouldn't trust this guy".
---
The guy that recently did 2 day 17 hours was talking with staysafe and he was talking about how it won't be possible in beta and that hunter will definitely be better.
---
&gt; It's close for sure
---
agree, but perhaps if I consider the 5% int from mages, that tips the scales.
---
Ah yes, melee hunter is so much more fun:
---
Wing Clip+Raptor Strike
---
Wing Clip
---
Were card names like these the result of translations not being very fluid or did someone really think “The Hunter With 7 Weapons” was a good enough card name?
---
Except that geralt can't tumble over rocks taller than 4 inches
---
I wouldn't consider chugging mana pots/runes and innervating yourself to be a "very effective spec". It sounds like you are rushing to get as much healing out as possible to top meters. Meanwhile your downrank regrowths are overhealing like mad with their 21 second hot. 
---
It's coefficient is so bad in vanilla, but I guess mana efficiently be damned. Gotta get to the top of that meter eh?
---
LOL yooo i thouht i was on the normal wow page AHHAHAHA jesus
---
The rule is: if the armor text on the item is white colored, bear form will increase it. If it's green (armor kits, enchantments) then it won't. 
---
Warden Staff and Smoldering Heart of the Mountain have white armor, which is why these are the bis for feral tanks
---
Inconsistency / hurdles in druid kit. No roots in caves, no trinkets in forms, almost no benefits to chicken :/
---
I love the Druid still tho. Gonna main it again.
---
That is not a character state 'WALKING'.  Showing a slower animation does not mean the character is toggled over to walk.
---
You do not have to manually toggle walking to get back to run when the slow wears off.  That means you are not actually WALKING.  ISWALKING would fail there.  They're not storing a separate value to remember if you were walking and restoring that when the slow wears off.
---
Yes
---
Sure that's nice, but you can get devouring plague and just do more damage and heal yourself instead. The 20% anti healing is pvp oriented and isn't that helpful because people who heal aren't really your main threat. The hex damage reduction is the more important part and Undead gets a similar variant. So if you're going shadow and you don't get Blackout, Devouring plague stomps on the effectiveness of Hex of Weakness. Hex is in more ways useful to a healing priest and Devouring Plague is more useful to a shadow priest.
---
Macro /moo to every skill
---
"has" to be addressed is a bit much. It doesn't have to be, it's just a nice to have. I feel this is a low on the priority pole. Yeah, I'd like everything to be 100% authentic, might as well play 1.12, but running 1.12 is out of the question.
---
Love ff8. Recently put 40 hours into it. Great game to pass the time with.
---
I think fostering cliques in a 40person raid environment is the best way to keep almost everyone mostly-happy. 
---
I honestly miss those group chats.
---
I, unlike you, actually take into account that it's called an "honor" system.  Absolutely no honor in killing someone 20 levels lower than you, it really is just sad.
---
Retail is way more demanding.
---
I'd take cannibalise and 10 shadow resistance over 5% int but that's just me :]
---
You posted this 3 times in less than 30 minutes. Congratulations you’ve exceeded normal stupid and achieved what was thought to previously be impossible.
---
That's interesting. I can see that. Clothing often induces more fantasy than when you've can see it all naked on display. Plus there's a bigger crowd willing to give money, because of the legions of horny teens having Twitch accounts their parents pay for. It's practically pedophilia.
---
Well here is where it doesnt become so straight forward anymore. The damage that you get from 1% crit is directly dependent of your strength. Therefore, 20 str can never be = X DPS. I don't know the formula of the top of my head by I am sure you can figure it out with some simple math or via google. One thing that's really good about crit is how much rage you get. Generally though I'd say 15 str ~= 1 crit. But yeah, it really depends. 1 crit is aprox 1% DPS. Because: in 100 hits you're gonna crit on average once from that crit and since a crit is twice the dmg you'll have 101% DPS. Now, is X str more than 1% DPS? That's what you have to figure out.

---
&gt; Monkeynews got into the Beta because his account is from 2006 and had literally nothing to do with Tips
---
No. Tribe said on stream that Tips is the reason that so many of the private server guys got into the stream, incl. all of APES.
---
lol who cares, let him play how he wants.  If he wants to backpedal, let him backpedal.  If he turns with his keyboard, let him.  This whole elitest attitude that is coming out lately just about how people use their goddamn keyboard will be the death of bringing new players into this wonderful game.
---
My experience as a Shaman in vanilla: 1) Get hit by Cheap Shot.  2) Earthbind.  3) Remove poison.  4) Ghost wolf.  5) scram.  Late-period warriors I could see coming and avoid, so basically, getting rekt required a squad.
---
That makes no sense to be honest. C'thun was unkillable for 3 months , any guild of that calibre would have been in AQ40 from day 1, killing Twins in 3 weeks would have meant you would have been stuck with C'thun prenerf status for at least 2 months.
---
Welcome my friend. Welcome welcome!!!
---
For PvP it is
---
Some basic world pvp and flag running capability
---
I've been trying to find an answer to this and maybe you can shed some light. 
---
Where do Locks with 1.12 lie on the pvp scale in pre-raid and MC gear assuming equal gear levels? I guess basically just will they be competitive in pvp in phases 1 And 2 before BWL?
---
Wait. When was wf nerfed In vanilla?
---
Oh thank god. It’s one of the very few mods I want to use.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it sound like that at all. Poor words on my end.
---
I'll enjoy letting my pet kill you for free honor as you're not worth the arrows.
---
Lol indeed very strange. Great info tho thanks for that!
---
i have cancer now
---
It has been removed, because it is a repost/spam. Just like this post is about to be removed. However, to answer your question, unless you got an email and you can access beta servers, you are not in beta. Beta is ending July 12th anyway, so most likely they are not inviting anyone else.
---
I was under the impression that it wasn't if you're slowed or not but rather there's a specific movespeed cutoff.
---
Tauren hunter can now Wong clip from 30’. 
---
I don’t think either of these two concerns will cause much trouble for people that want to play the class and I think a lot of folks won’t notice or feel there’s an issue at all.
---
Stutter-shooting may just become more important in pvp, but hunters were doing that anyway.
---
I was pretty turned off by this initially but now that I understand a bit more about the mechanics I’m planning to roll hunt just not sure if it will be main or alt. 
---
I’m a little more concerned about traps at this point.
---
Reality check:
---
There are very few bosses where DPS ACTUALLY FUCKING MATTERS, where meme specs might not be brought.
---
Unless you are part of the 1% guilds pushing for AQ40 and Naxx, won't FUCKING MATTER. You can clear MC with 10 people (you can kill rag with around that if not less)
---
Nobody has a gun to your head and forces you to bring a "MEME" spec to your group. Don't want to group with them? Just make your own groups.
---
Don't like ferals for your 5 man? wait 3 hours for that prot warrior to show up and demands all the BOE's to cover their "TANK FEE".
---
Sounds like two taurens dueling will look odd.
---
Did you just hamstring me from 20 yards away!?

---
"best" healer in premades would absolutely be Paladins and it's not even close.  Raids, that can be argued.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05502300501
---
Threat because healers have heal buttons and threat matters more than 4% armor.
---
Even with a full on tank spec, I'm still dropping 2 points from thick hide for feline swiftness for soloing and farming and such, and I might even drop improved enrage so I can get 2/2 blood frenzy for soloing as well.
---
[11/35/5](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050321303222151-05) is looking pretty solid to me for a tanking/outdoor world soloing spec.  I'm not particularly concerned with potential kitty DPS in raids, as I don't plan on doing it and I have a group that wants me specifically to bear tank.
---
Parry = more counter attacks and every time you parry your next auto attack is faster.
---
Sounds like retail is worse than I thought.
---
Feral Tanks are not required for any endgame content. Period. You can use them, but you dont need to.
---
Early on it didn't autocast so wand was completely useless. I think lesser/greater magic wands were added later as well. With autocast in and lvl 5 lesser magic wand the *wand spec* hype makes a lot more sense, but yeah it doesn't make a huge difference once you're into lvl 40+ where a lot more of your damage comes from spells.
---
Just to be clear, full BG it will show terrible.  I am only arguing if you isolate the key fights, which I typically think of when I get dove on by 3+melee and have to survive longer then enemy priest eating same amount of shit, and look only at those engagements it can carry.
---
In cata lightwell became standard part of the toolkit. It was low mana and fire and forget. Usually it stood there for the entire boss fight.
---
Eventually one of our rogues found out that it is actually a really strong heal (got buffed a couple of times iirc). I started to get an even bigger lead in healing done over the rest. And nobody relised why until they checked the log and saw that the rogue was intentionally taking damage he didn't have to and healing himself through the lightwell.
---
After that the use of lightwell became mandatory in my guild.
---
Just a fun lightwell anecdote.
---
I always thought there should be a spec that activates when you join a raid group. That way you still have to choose what your specs are, but it isn’t punishing for classes that need to respec to raid.
---
Would 7 weeks be super intense to you?

As long as you can report non-rp names im good to be honest. It is impossible to enforce RP in Orgrimmar/Iron Forge
---
Really the one saving grace of shadow dps early on is you get a very easy +10% hit from talents. Going smite build means you've lost that one thing, so yeah you've just meme spec'd the meme spec.
---
[How viable would this spec be for leveling](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05-23505100202005-5)

I recall shadow sorta sucking up to 40 and the idea is you just spam smite and wand basically, then respec

Nope, troll is number one.

Agreed but anyone can say "we are mature". Its hard to really prove unless someone is in the discord/guild.

RP is for losers.
---
Hey guys, 
---
I'm slowly but surely inching my way toward deciding between Lock and Hunter. 
---
I will be raiding regularly but my main concern is enjoying pvp in all forms. 
---
My last question mark really is the pvp viability of Warlocks in phase 1, 2 and to a lesser extent 3. How do Locks fare at these gear levels (pre-raid and MC loot)?
---
&gt; Druids were the least popular class in Vanilla if memory serves.
---
This is correct.
---
Damn dude you just described my ideal weekend
---
couldn’t have said it better, it’s like the storyline was written from a single player perspective, but like it just doesn’t work if its not done right.  EX: even tho SWTOR makes your player character do some crazy important things it never gave me the same feeling.  maybe it was just well written enough that I didn’t care that every other player of x class has killed y big figure or maybe it was because at the end of the day the progression logically builds up to you being important, but for whatever reason it works there.
---
Skinning works on level by skill x 5. So if a mob is level 63, you need 315 skill to skin skull mobs. That means you need a finkle skinner (zulian slicer comes much later) and some gloves with +5 skinning.
---
I can't recall if all the core hounds are level 63, but if they were level 61 or 62 then just finkles is fine.
---
Citation needed more melee leeway exclusivity please.
---
Try this guide: https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
you cant with just normal quests, you need to do runecloth turnins. which are pre 60 so i guess you can but thats not what you ment.
---
if you do all quests you will be somewhere around 12/24 revered and still need about 160 stacks to turn in
---
All of those have no place in wow
---
I'd honestly surprised if it was possible to get all of them prior to 60
---
Yep right here, and slightly is understated. 2 druids vs 6 shamy in your raid? Tier gear for daaays.
---
And you KNOW rng will make druid tier drop so much more than shamans -.-
---
I remember this guild...why did I have a character on Kalecgos
---
RP servers were always and will continue to be the lowest population realms in existence.
---
Blizzard is already worried about splitting the population across to many realms (hence layering) I highly DOUBT they will entertain the idea of having an always low-pop RP server.
---
fair enough.
---

Since they don't stack you can simply use raid healing assignments.
---
Also once gear gets better you can go with a regrowth build
---
I can't ever comment on these posts without a bias considering the absolute unit of a computer you would get for the price of a 2019 mbp
---
Arguably the only good part left are the raids and dungeons. Everything else is so meaningless it just hurts.
---
I certainly don’t. Streamers are worth less than dog poop to me, and their opinions even less than that
---
Sigh.. you need to be swung at for dodge to have a chance, extra lightning shield damage is a guaranteed damage boost, dodge is an unreliable mitigation. Parry is a different story.
---
The sexism. I mostly stayed to either friend group Guilds or all women ones due to it. Joined a PvP Guild on a fresh server for fun only to constantly be harassed that I needed to show a photo to prove I wasn't a hambeast.
---
Ya already know Im stockpiling adderall already for this level 60 rush.
---
You actually did something impressive there. You didn’t just show up and everyone assumed you were the greatest, you had to take down a real threat. That’s the difference imo.
---
The wetlands run as horde.
---
That's why rockbiter is used instead of wf with a slow 2h.
---
Yeah and we'll have way fewer people on launch /s
---
This is absolute gold!!!
---
Only one way to find out...
---
That wasn't until the expansions. In vanilla you had to hold shift to auto loot.
---
Pretty much everything works in a controlled environment. No instant spells other than Shadow also means no easy way to dodge mechanics too. It's interesting to try. Give it a shot for some fun, but I think you'll find similar results. People like to pretend like everyone back in the day was an idiot, but we were smart enough to figure out which specs did and didn't work well enough to raid with haha.
---
The forum rage about ninja looters and need rollers is going to be interesting. Classic loot rules are a new experience for some people, and they've grown up with raging online as a common outlet. I bet this subreddit will be covered with posts about it at times.
---
I remember Warden Staff dropping on a Mara run when I was playing druid. I've never been more tense waiting for the hunter to roll.
---
I thought they meant us. I guess I missed the APES griefers as I didn't watch 100% of the tourney

Ranged attacks only get 2 yards if both are moving, assuming that [these cata numbers](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#135929566858) were the same in 1.12.

2.01 it looks like.

While is it true that they built a custom server, their client is new aswell. Their old 1.12.1 client and their 'new' stripped 1.13 client based on patch 8.1.5 (started on 7.3.5) do have a lot of differences like GPU Support Range, Exploitability etc
---
Rexxar does whatever he wants
---
INT also gave attack power in Vanilla.  Changed with the pre-BC patch, IIRC.
---
i never said druids couldn't tank, they just can't in a hybridspec outside of 5mans
---
It was pretty dumb.  There is a reason it's called *SANDLOL*.
---
well there is a way
---
Translations probably
---
That's your opinion.
---
Can't speak for shaman, but feral tank will be the most viable. They still have limitations tough, mainly lack of a fear breaker, I think poor AoE tanking, but they can hold their own. If you want to min/max, expect to be farming Gnomeregan for maces constantly to bring to raids to maximize threat generation.
---
Unless the two guilds have a lot of history these kinds of clashes usually only result in one group whiping the other and then going ahead and zoning in - both parties want to get into the raid.
---
Some servers do wind up with guilds that have groups of people just looking for trouble all of the time outside of raid instances but if your guild is smart and moves as a 40 person group you'll steam roll those efforts.
---
I have played Vanilla daily for over 4 years and the hype is not dead for me yet.
---
Just disengage from everything until early August. The hype may be gone but your interest should jump back up.
---
You really think aq40 and naxx are only for the 1% still?  Not anymore.
---
Yeah and let me tell you farming the BIS to be competitive at 40 is brutal. For a rogue it's this fun bit:
---
Basilisk hide pants and mark of the chosen from mara. Mara is super fucking hard at 40. 
---
Blazewind breastplate comes from tremors of the earth which involves 2 level 50 elite dragons. There's a whole raid-like strategy for this one where rogues clear whelps, and plow the way for kiting hunters.
---
Lordric's helmet from "rise, obsidion" in searing gorge. This requires like 10-15 people, and you swap which 5 man gets it each time.
---
Gryphon riders stormhammer is from saving sharpbeak which is its own special brand of hell. The other weapon can be all kinds of shit. Commonly the boe healing mace or hand of righteousness.
---
Swampwalker boots there are likely only 3-4 pairs of on the whole beta
---
Scorpashi sash comes from ZF which is no picnic at 40
---
Mason fraternity ring comes from completing stairs in ZF which is preeetty intense at 40
---
Ironspines ring takes about 50-60 sm gy runs
---
The best necks afaik are lvl 40 "trackers" of the monkey
---
Fleshhide shoulders are from RFD, and pretty easy to get. 
---
Gnomish death ray involves farming essence of undeath from 58 elites. I never got that after days of farming w a hunter.
---
Tigerstrike mantle is a super rare world drop, and the one behind it is from doing a *fucking hard* quest in STV involving killing 3 elites in 3 packed ships.
---
Sorry if that's a little long, but that's all the farming I personally did. I got very lucky to get gutripper on cath early on, but it's just not that great compared to stormhammer's topend.
---
&gt;I don't really care about what someone reverse engineered
---
So you don't care about the way it's supposed to be? The beta has something like 17k bug reports. I wouldn't test something on that beta, and then assume it's working correctly.
---
Not sure what guilds you’ve been in that run with LC, and if they’re running it purely based on who tops meters it’s one of the worst run guilds. So many more important factors into distributing loot with a LC such as attendance and attitude than just dps.
---
Having 5% more mana compared to CL/LB having a FULL 1 second shorter caster time seems really damn stupid, no matter how you try to argue it.
---
Welcome to the Classic community and hive mind, brother!
---
You can make anything work. The truth is if you're leveling, blowing gold to respec at 40, then again at 60, really sucks. It may not seem like much, but every bit of gold you spend on something is a setback for other important shit. Not getting your mount at 40, but instead 43, is a HUGE drag. 
---
I would say the biggest problems with this build is the fact that you're specing into healing stuff. Renew isn't that great. And the improved casting resistance only works for heals. Your shield protects your from interruption while it is up. The improved range is almost pointless. And Holy nova isn't that great. You're not really gonna have a lot of times where AOE farming is viable. You can AOE farm on classes like Mages cause that's what it's built around. You're much better off fighting 1-2 guys at a time.
---
You can play however you want, though!
---
They haven't fixed bugs reported from day 1, why would they want hundreds of reports of the same thing again
---
The time investment alone to get there, not many people are going to be interested in that.
---
EA shines better on other classes than it does on mages, but same applies to WoTF as well. 
---
It's mostly horde vs alliance pick without any clear winner. If you plan to do solo wpvp I would stick to horde, and if it's something organized - then Alliance since paladins are the best racial so far in this game. 
---
Regarding shamans - it is the most trendy PvP spec (elem) at the moment, but it's not something new in the game meta. They have considerable amount of weaknesses and I am fairly confident that a lot of people rolling them because of the hype are not going to be as happy in the end as they expected.
---
The same reason you play diablo 2 on repeat. Customization and an increased loot pool.
---
Is your honor gain effected by  your wins and losses?  From my understanding you are ranked against your own faction.  So I would only gain honor based on how other Alliance players do.  Is this correct?
---
Its called....Addons.... and that is super vanilla like
---
It didn't. Int only gave increased mana and spell crit to hunters during Vanilla and nothing more. Oh and faster weapon skill leveling too I guess.
---
Once you sit down and play it the hype will come rushing back.
---
I dont understand this logic. Yeah I no longer feel like "damn i wish i could be there" while watching the beta streams. But the release is going to be a whole other thing. Im still really hyped for that. Levelling up, making friends, gearing up at 60 and eventually raiding. That hasn't been in the beta. The full release will have so many players all excited to play. You'll get to do all the things seen on stream, but with your own character togheter with so many others.
---
He could anal me anytime &lt;3
---
No. Enjoy standing on your freeze trap and it not triggering while you are still getting hit.
---
Hahaha sounds a lot like my vanilla experience with my warrior. I think we’re better off learning the hard way
---
Ah ok.  I hope they do rp/pvp too
---
I mean... it could also be the class he knows the most......
---
Private servers use Blizzard's client from 2006. Classic uses a new, made-for-Classic client of course.
---
In the context of this discussion it's important to point out that it's Blizzard's own, unmodified client that gets used on PS because the chat bubbles look exactly how Blizzard designed them to look.
---
I definitely remember some e-girl shit back in the day
---
About watchmen, I don’t see the logic there. Literally every scene was straight out of the comics, except of course for the end, but other than that it was the comic
---
When the majority of fights in the game are less than a minute mana efficiency isn't always important. And if you focus on tanks and melee for regrowths with rejuv for everyone else the overhealing isn't too bad.
---
Another way of looking at it is the warriors that actually are tanks for guilds already have all the loot and probably aren't going to roll on much. I'll have most of what I need a few weeks after launch but will still do a few different dungeons for very rare drops
---
True, to an extent.  My guild was actively encouraging off tanks to not roll on Wrath gear so that our main tanks could get full tier two.  I was the newest tank in the guild so any hope of wrath gear (my original goal) was slim.  I'm not complaining about the outcome though.
---
Get some homies to funnel some cloth to you aswell as this. 
---
Honestly you can level first aid and tailoring with little extra downtime.
---
&gt; It's mostly horde vs alliance pick without any clear winner
---
I suppose I should also be concerned with Alliance being underrepresented on PvP servers?  I played PvE back in the day but will be rolling PvP this time around.  Do Alliance just have it rougher on PvP servers since most people might pick horde for their superior PvP racials overall?
---
I know vanilla realms had a big problem with some realms being an 80/20 split.
---
It changed when BC hit because that's when they made agility only give you 1 AP: 
---
* Agility will now grant 1 Ranged Attack Power.
---
INT gave it to you in Vanilla.  When BC hit you got 0 from INT.
---
I half agree with the smart enough thing. I was in Vanilla too...
---
It's not that people were stupid so much as people formed opinions about the class that never went away no matter what happened. So like Feral Druids, it took until Naxx came out before people cottoned on to the fact that they could tank raids.
---
I remember for the first half of Vanilla people refused to take Paladins as a healer in 5 mans also... for no good reason... I would join for LFG healer and then get kicked because I wasn't a priest (or have to argue that they are objectively wrong and they'd let me in). That one went away sooner than the feral tank one, but I still remember it being a thing.
---
I'm not expecting this to work 100% lol. I'm basically hoping it's a close to viable meme spec.
---
Wait till you meet Gordo defending his plantation.
---
PEoPLe OF DaLRan LOok tO tHe SkIes!!
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this leeway, spell batching 2004 tech in 2019 shit.
---
Also layering is a mess.
---
For farming, it depends.  If you get pvp gear, the tier 0/0.5 or 1 gear, that gives you a bunch of spellpower as well as mixed stats overall that make you extremely versatile in basically any role, regardless of spec. Also, you can look up videos, but balance druids are actually quite good at the lasher farm in DM:E as well.  And balance would be technically faster at princess clears, if that's something you're looking for.
---
You're probably looking for a "moonglow" spec, similar to the one here: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zjx0MxsZZixcoxq.  You can put the points in a few different places, especially the resto tree (I go furor for pvp, but if you're not doing that, a guild would appreciate the improved buff, for example).  Also, depending on your professions, if you're farming mining or herbs, this kit will have enough to defend yourself a bit.
---
If you like shitting in a hole in the ground, yeah...
---
&gt;If you are truly "casual"
---
- then go full hardcore. ;)
---
Dude shut the fuck up
---
They can probably hamstring people offline now
---
Was trying to keep this on the DL, but this is the spec I’m going to be run in my hardcore griefing guild. 
---
(http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVVGd0xoZxZ0EVVo0z)[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cVVGd0xoZxZ0EVVo0z]
---
Its goal is to have as many cc’s as possible to be as annoying as I possibly can. I plan on early on using the ZF stun staff, or maybe Silent Fang from Scholo. It’s not viable as a 1v1 spec but works as a tank hunter grief spec in order to annoy my horde enemies as much as possible while my group aoe’s them down.
---
Should clarify that it isn't just the font, it's how the numbers pop and move around when you get a crit, and how long it takes to fade away and other such details. As far as I'm aware there's no way to fix this through an addon, at least not on retail.
---
Don't play it then, we won't care.
---
&gt; Its sad blizzard and some people rate success by the money they make instead of the amount of people actually playing &amp; enjoying the game.
---
It's not sad, it's the nature of business. Which is all Blizzard is.
---
They do not give two shits about you as a human being, they care about your wallet. The only reason they ever do anything to the game is to make sure people keep playing it and buying shit within it.
---
Get that through your head and you'll lead a much more successful life and hardly ever be disappointed by anyone.
---
What if I told you that those details, while changing the game, do not change the social aspects of the game that made it a hit in the first place.  
---
Plus, there is still time to get them right and blizzard is responsive to feedback from this beta from what I've seen.
---
I hope your day is getting better :)
---
It's boring for healers, but tanks and certain DPS have to be smart about listening for ins and outs, making sure they're not too close to the mob, etc.
---
Worst class to raid as in EQ is a Shaman, hands down. You couldn't pay me to be the buff bitch.
---
But will be gone and nobody will care about layering.
---
Batching and leeway are garbage, but the title is still true, even if it's a complete shit show at launch - it just being up is enough to succeed.
---
When I want to play an mmorpg there is nothing that's worth the effort, classic changes that - not because I want to relive my past, but because there is no mmorpg like Classic that will have a playerbase throughout it's lifespan.
---
Vanilla talents only give the illusion of choice. Sure, you can decide to gimp yourself with a shitty build, that doesn't make it a good system
---
It's fine for leveling so it's not so empty but it's not actually well-designed.
---
just because you dont see any fun in it doesnt mean it cant befun for someone else.
---
yeah 2% crit is hugh, a stab wound can heal, crit is here to stay!
---
Discovery points? Pretty much 100%
---
My guild killed blockade first week too :)
---
I think it's entirely possible that you're confusing a lack of hype with a lack of will to watch others play the game. In a game where immersion is one of the top qualities, the experience you get watching a stream is absolutely nothing like playing it
---
Only thing from retail ill miss is saving $15 a month to not be subbed
---
At the start of every dungeon:
---
"Roll need if you're gonna equip it immediately, greed otherwise"
---
I *think* what’s happening is the hit chance with the pole is based on the fishing skill, and since his fishing skill will be way higher than his 2h skill, he won’t be missing while he fights with it.
---
Against all the norms, UNDEAD
---
ftfy
---
Then don’t play.
---
you....you're using too many napkins. bampkins.
---
7 weapons and no bow because it went to the warrior and rogue for reasons unknown. Yay everyone fucking over everyone is all the hunters fault.
---
