ABOUT US
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
GOALS
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec or so. Take your time, enjoy this revival of classic we've been waiting so long for but don't forget we're here to raid at some point. So be ready for that as well.
---
RAID SCHEDULE
---
We're thinking a mid week raid once ZG, AQ20 rolls out but for the main raid group Fridays and Saturdays evenings are likely. We'll adjust depending on whos recruited into the guild. 2-3 hour raid nights on the weekends with the weekday ones being 2 hours or so. 
---
LOOT
---
Right now we’re thinking a variation on DKP and Loot Council. The more you help the more gear you get but there’s going to be moments here and there where a tank should get first dibs to help the whole raid progress. Thats just an example but you get the picture. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins. 
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules etc.

They might just announce TBC release
---
I'm all for filling in the blanks on missing quests, like how Call of Air for shamans is quite clearly just cut off. There's various quests like that, as well as classes/levels that don't have a class quests or proper rewards.
---
But adding racial spells for every class... is rather dangerous territory.
---
Dude i knew it. DAOC was the best mmo of all time (hey i like wow also.) 
---
I am pretty sure the OP to this sub thread was projecting. Because at the time of vanilla i can remember the mess it was and how everyone wasn't more servers, stable servers, wanted mobs to loot because you killed darn bandits and you got stuck looting for those darn red bandanas (okay i have mentioned this a few times sorry i can remember this so well. I literately just played daoc for a while until it was more stable. It was real bad.) 
---
There is no way any of these people remember this or they just had no other games to play so they took what they could get.
---
Yeah. I get the feeling those on the discord are the ones in for the long haul. Hopefully those "tourists" we keep hearing about will fall in love with classic.
---
Lol hell yeah dude. Something about defending cows. Maybe something vegan. Like eatsnomeats
---

---
You can't *really* replace treasure finder with an addon, unless you don't mind going to physically check spawn points as the addon show them to you. Honestly, the cliche of "play what you like" is kinda true. It's hard to enjoy a character you don't like looking at for the long run.
---
Gotta say though, I know that dwarves aren't everyone's favorite... but I think they look fantastic visually. And stoneskin is pretty damn good.

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST 
---
**Loot System:**
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 1 Extremely Talented Dwarf Priest, 1-2 Warlocks, 1 Fury
---
Team 2 1 Dwarf Priest, 1 Warlock
---
Team 3 Looking for a guild or group of individuals to kick-start and lead this team!
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
That actually sounds great. 
---
Orcs could've become Blademasters and Shamans would get their own version of a Death Knight.
---
Pretty sure he meant survive in-game :)
---
Agree.

---
The population trend will not look like vanilla's did but more like WoD and if lucky cata.
---
Just so expectations are set, they have already stress tested with layering and with the time left till launch, I don't believe there are any major changes coming down. This is mostly theoretical.
---
I am curious, so you honestly believe Blizzard just didn't think about the possibility of applying layering to only the first few starting zones?
---
It goes like this:
---
Every priest is a shadow priest
---
Wars are the best tanks, but they aren't always the best tank spec and just rely on taunt.
---
Mages are the best overall dps in raids, but their gear doesn't come from raids. 
---
Shamans are for totems and the totems will always be out of range. 
---
Warlocks don't know what soul shards are. 
---
All rogues are ninjas.
---
Hunters will miss Traq shot. How? I don't know, they should be hit capped. 
---
Paladins have two health bars.
---
Druids can do everything, but you will never play with someone who does everything well.

Will check
---
I played feral in naxx and my warriors and rogues loved be
---
Gotta have that LotP buff
---
Exactly what i was thinking. Lazy ass repost will have my dislike :)
---
Escape artist does nothing for vanish.
---
Very real question. I understand you can buy some pretty good boe gear but the best is always bop. How does gold help you there other than providing consumables without farming? Also, I understand you would have mounts without effort, but I don’t see that as having a huge impact as both 40/60 mounts will be extremely commonplace. Lastly, I could see you being able to grind crafting professions straight to 300 but many of the best recipes are also found while raiding/require a lot of effort to obtain. 
---
I don’t see Classic as a game where you can buy gold and instantly be on par/ahead of someone who has spent their time grinding for themselves. It may make some things easier but it is not the key to greatness in WoW.
---
Perhaps there’s something I’m missing.
---
Definitely agreed about adding unique racials for each class heh. My  bad, didn't mean to say they ought to do that. 
---
But this thread made me think about some unfinished, unpolished things. For example, there's a whole long adventuring quest for druids to get aquatic form (it's actually pretty long and requires one to run/swim around all over the continents searching underwater for some lock boxes), there's a cool quest for bear form, and then there's just purchasing cat form/travel form from your trainer. You can tell that they just ran out of time and resources to flesh those things out.
---
Or grassfed. Or grasspowered.
---
Yeah, of course. But it's not bad is my point. Like having a shadow priest and a proper specced healer instead of a weave specced holy priest and a "proper" dps isn't that much worse. Having a ret/enhance/boomy instead of a proper dps is quite a lot worse.
---
&gt;Layering is static, that's how it works. I don't know if you are genuinely confused or just being disingenuous so that you can more easily hate the system.
---
It's literally not, which is the entire problem?  You seem pretty well-spoken, how is your head so buried in the sand? Log out and back on? Switched to a different layer.  Join a party with someone i a different layer? Switched layer.  Also, other people switching layers for the same reasons.  So both you and others are switching layers pretty often.  The point being; you will NEVER be in the same layer with a consistent group of players as you level.
---
&gt;Layering will be abused forever! its temporary, with a set maximum end
---
There is currently a projected end.  It is not set in stone by any means.
---
&gt;You will login to different people each time! literally not how it works at all, you are set to a static layer on creation
---
This is not true!!!! Why do you think this?!?  Whoever told you this is wrong!  Hell, there is video of people switching layers *while they are playing*.
---
Watch this video if you actually give a shit.
---
https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ
---
I've said this about many betas. Sometimes they get fixed and sometimes they launched plagued with known bugs. I have some faith because they are listening to the community especially with the stealth animations, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Having longer phases is a good way to make people unsub and wait for the next phase.
---
I side with Magram because I like the way their name sounds more than Gelkis. I don't remember at all if there was a point or even anything decent from getting rep in those factions but I plan on doing it.
---
Cool? They don’t realize another Warrior or Rogue would be infinitely superior. Like I said, any guild that allows cats doesn’t have high quality players.
---
I don't get how this counts as a repost.
---
Captain got to the semi in the duel tournament - he's a young lad but he's good
---

---
Are they changing it to the new version for Classic or something?
---
That’s not why people get bored. They get bored because the initial rush has worn off and we’re back to the same old boring content with none of the excitement of a fresh server rush.
---
Really enjoying these, thanks!
---
RoseArt is just as good as Crayola! Just as good! - Druids

(I was a druid)
---
As a Hordesman, I look forward to making the long trek over to Deadmines and experiencing this bad boy myself for the first time soon.
---
If people get pissed off because someone else got loot that was a better upgrade for that person than for themself then maybe they shouldn't be in the guild if they can't look towards what's best for said guild. We brought a few trials in during BoD this tier just gone and if they get the biggest upgrade from a drop, they got it, just like everyone else. If you're worried about people leaving your guild after getting loot then dipping for another guild, then clearly your guild isn't good enough to be worth staying in anyway.
---
Classic isn't no changes. If you are dead set on no changes you need to go play a pserver what updates their info from data gather from classic.
---
Classic's entire api , geometry (the surfaces of the world and how your character interacts with them), and tons more aren't vanilla at all. they are using the 7.x core, they cannot be the same. So if you are a nochanges person you have to look else where.
---
No if you just want as little changes as possible layering is less change than a dynamic re-spawn for 9k players. Now you might say queue servers at 3k. But this is also not vanilla like as they were lower at release and the population growth of vanilla was large were is classic will have a pop drop off.  
---
In short you cannot recreate the vanilla wow experience. However blizzard is attempting to at least attempting to mimic it.
---
this isn't going to occur in classic.
---
Depends on the speed of the weapon.
---
14 AP = +1 DPS
---
DPS * weapon speed = damage.
---
Or "nazi"
---
Eh, razor gore was a butch to coordinate as a guild, let alone a pug
---
When soloing, DPS is pretty much always better than longevity. Its generally better for going mob to mob and for recovery time, so Imp Aspect of the Hawk is generally better.
---
Bestial Swiftness is definitely worth it if you want to level faster, its just a passive buff, rather than Dash's on use CD.
---
Imp Mend Pet isnt worth it, theres actually very few things youll need to dispel, the only really bad ones tend to be chance to hit debuffs , but then again, your pet has Growl, so he should hold agro for the most part and your DPS is still decent, so its not like the nightmare debuff it is for Warriors and Rogues. Its also way to mana cost heavy to use on the more minor debuffs.
---
Bestial Discipline and Spirit Bond tend to be unfortunate casualties of there being better talents for your pet. Bestial Discipline is quite good when your BM, but the aforementioned talents are the way to go. 
---
One thing you NEVER want to be doing is tanking though, it pushbacks your auto-shots and Aimed shot (once you have it), your DPS will be taking a huge nose dive when you do that.
---
I'm watching the warcraft movie. I thought it was an okay movie, not great but not bad either. 
---
WIsh they would make a second one.
---
I bet you would be fine waiting a month or two to play.
---
When was that? All I've seen was the Server Link thing they've done.
---
&gt;. If you logout and log back in, you will still be on that layer
---
This is not true. Please see the video I linked of people switching layers without invites.
---
I don't know how to further hammer into your head that your preconceived notions are wrong.
---
It is not static.
---
this but unironically
---
that's probably actually what was happening in the screenshot, and whoever took it is the one getting memed on here
---
They were supposed to be but they only did the 1 and then did other things instead

[Horde][NA-PvP][Semi-Hardcore PvP/PvE]
---
About Us
---
We are a semi-hardcore guild that will be forming in Classic on a North American PvP server! We have a core group that have experience in Vanilla, Organized PvP and Raids.
---
We will be a PvP/PvE guild. Raid times listed below. Premade bgs and WPvP will be a major part of who we are. The Alliance Will Fear Us!! Join us if you are someone 
---
who wants it all! From crushing ally skulls on the daily to pushing content and getting that sick loot.
---
Goals
---
Our goals include getting everyone who is serious about being apart of our guild geared up with BiS Pre-Raid gear and pushing that raid content constantly progressing
---
getting the best gear available for us, Slaughtering Alliance on the daily including Premade BGs and WPvP events pushing that PvP ranking, and defending all guildys 
---
from PvP harassment. We are here to help each other in being the best we can be. The Horde will Revere us and the Alliance will Fear us! Play the way you want to!
---
Raid Schedule
---
Our raid times will be  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday nights. 9pm EST. Tentatively.
---
All classes will be welcome off the start as we will all have to level to 60 and its impossible to guarantee spots as people will change there class,ect.
---
Loot
---
Our loot will be loot council/dkp. DKP is gained on Raid Boss Kills/ WPvP event attendance and those willing to help with Pre-Raid prep work. Council to ensure 
---
the proper gear reaches proper class. Gear available for classes and peoples dkp will be open for all to see before the raid and posted for all to see.
---
Expectations
---
We expect that if you sign up for a event on our website/calendar that you will show up. If signed up for a raid show up prepared and ready 15 mins pre-posted time or you
---
will miss out on the next raids. PvP is a big aspect of how the Alliance sees us so we expect good attendance in WPvP events. We understand everyone has lives but if you sign
---
up show up!

If you listen to the interview he says a few major issues:
---
-	leeway
---
-	frost nova heartbeat 
---
-	and most importantly: slow and desynced respawns
---
So if you clear a pack of 10, they will start to respawn after X minutes, but not simultaneously, every 30 seconds or so. So this effectively extends the length of time between full clears. 
---
As a mage...it’s disappointing to say the least. He mentioned there could be a whole new meta of aoe spots if it’s even viable at all.
---
I agree, I don't expect any design/system changes from the current beta.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I 100% believe they thought about it, they know what they're doing. I just think that the time/resources required to make it a per zone basis like so many have suggested is not a top priority to them.
---
If they spend more resources in fixing the current layering system, they get no real benefit to their bottom line. They just have to manage the forum posts of angry people.
---
e.g: relationships
---
50% ???That's like double of 25% !!!
---
So many Shamans! Why? This class used to be an underdog, and I liked it that way!
---
But vanish removes movement impairing effects
---
There may be a little higher curve but DW'ing will be bis
---
The game at release was in such bad shape. I mainly played DAOC until they fixed the queues, server instability, and loot bug.

\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Finally, I'm writing a blog [**here**](http://goblinrocketfuelrats.wordpress.com/) about the adventures of our guild written from my perspective. It's story-driven, somewhat RP-ish, but doesn't take itself too seriously. I already have few stories from the open Stress Test, and once Classic launches the stories there will be not just mine but all guild members. If you like the idea of having a little wow-diary of your leveling (mis)adventures and enjoy looking back on them, join us now :-)
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or join us on Discord.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
Yes I think that it will and I’m ready to teach them the wonder of this game, all who are willing to learn this zen
---
No, I would lean more towards your view. You are a hero, but you are part of a group of heros. 
---
You are not suddenly a better druid than Malfurion or the best Paladin to have ever lived. You've performed heroic deads but you are not a god.
---
Ive actually been told find treasure is great for Dwarf Rogue. Lets you quickly check chest spawns in high value areas like Tyrs Hand, stealth in, solo a few mobs and grab the chest.
---
This is a good example of an appropriate downvote. Not contributing to the conversation.

Priest - LF Hardcore Raiding Guild
---
* Region: NA
---
* Server Type: PvE
---
* Faction: Horde
---
* Age: 38
---
* Class: Will be rolling Priest to start and main it. Plans to level a Mage for farming and alchemy.
---
* Professions: Priest - Tailoring &amp; Enchanting (this can be changed if the guild needs) | Mage - Herb &amp; Alch
---
* Playtime: 9PM EST and later. I work part-time as a cook off season (FL) so will be on during the day as well. Raiding I would prefer 9PM EST or later.
---
* LF in a Guild: Just laid back attitudes, but focused when raiding hits so we can get through it and move on with our lives.
---
* Rules: Any loot system is fine by me. Loot Council works as long as it's fair to those who are showing initiative to help the guild and not just "he's a friend" while they sat around and did absolutely nothing all week to help get ready for raid time... "Anyone got a spare flask?!" \*rolls eyes (yes, main tanks and healers should be priority when starting, I know).
---
* Other: Have a friend who will be playing too, he wants to play a Druid tank. So possibility of having an off-tank join in as well.
---
* Contact: PM me here.
---
Yeah, you are the ones that caused Layering to happen. Be proud of yourself Xralius.
---
I haven't been there since Cata but I thought they were off to the side. Could be wrong though as I didn't play an Alliance Druid very much
---
The clip with Cdew actually illustrates it pretty well.
---
He joins a group, everything disappears (sucks, I wont argue that layering doesn't have negatives, I just dont let perfect be the enemy of good), leaves the group and hes back on the original layer.
---
Every other clip with mobs randomly disappearing is certainly weird, but there are possibilities such as the layers themselves being manually expanded or retracted (it is beta after all, and this was done on the stress tests).
---
I will never stop blaming Travis Fimmel for that.
---
t.5 gear is a casual catchup mechanism for those with high-ish play time who cant commit to a raid group. By the time it's out, you'll have hardcore raiders looking to get into strat for holy water in preperation for naxx. There's gameplay incentive for tier 2-2.5 geared players to run strat UD. 
---
Those who care about their DPS and keeping cutting edge gear have never cared about t0.5. That's not why it was added to the game. 
---
t.05 is about at bwl level. for someone who cant commit to a raid schedule, you're basically stuck with MC pugs, 20m raids, and 5 mans. t.05 is a great way for the casual player to get quality gear without going through the PvP grind or signing on to a guild to raid on a schedule.  BWL pugs are a crapshoot and I wouldn't count on many being successful, outside of very hardcore servers.
---
Not trying to help.
---
And? The content isn't going to just disappear because more content is released. Vanilla is not retail. New content releasing does not invalidate all previous content.
---
Nobody is going to want to farm MC for 8 months.
---
Um. Didnt the gnomes cause like a plague in gnomergan?
---
Not Great, Not Terrible
---
It is. Having played both druid and priest on Alliance, getting healsniped is the way of life. The more coordination your guild has, the less painful it is, because healing assignments will mean you can ignore the targets you know a paladin is going to heal too. It seems a lot of people here are saying we're just simply bad players for having problems with healsniping but it was very ubiquitous to me in casual gameplay.
---
Yes, I use it even as a Hunter. It’s really useful at early levels to get extra food and the occasional white items/potions which can be a huge help.
---
Interesting. I wonder why the person doing the Casinos was banned on my server.
---
Wasnt there a macro to prevent the key bind from activating again on a timer?
---
I like to call that my toddler leash ability.
---
Maybe I love macros a bit too much, but this is beginner/tutorial at best and is beyond borderline click-bait. It is at best a list of lines to add to useful macros and he should have expanded on them or titled the video differently. It is click-bait without a doubt and an easy and short video that explains nothing in detail.
---
Ahh, but at least you get that sweet sweet Argent Dawn rep! Seriously useful in later phases.
---
3 pc tier 2 is bis until like black temple

Hell yes. You might want to avoid the first week or two because all the stress of massive amount of players on launch can make things more confusing than they already are. Though you should definitley log in on the launch just to see the chaos, I'm just saying after you get a bit overwhelmed then don't worry take a week or two and then try again. Game is definitely worth playing even without nostalgia
---
There is, of course, the weekly run out to Azshara to get another Aqual Quintessence!
---
They made a valid argument, if no new phase invalidates old phases, why include phases? I believe there should be longer phases because it causes phase metas in pvp. Also gives the less hardcore players more time to get gear before being blown out of the water by try hards.
---
Sure server link aka merges servers.
---
Checked some footage from the Classic duel tournaments. It definitely looks like they are going with the newer boring numbers. Really disappointing. The thing that made the original so good was how the numbers would literally pop out. Like if you slow the footage or look closely, the numbers for a big crit will basically shoot out towards you and enlarge by like 300% for a split second. That is the key component that makes combat feel so exciting.
---
It is mostly subconscious. Even though Vanilla combat is slow, it always felt fast to me. I would describe it to people as feeling faster without knowing why. Now I know exactly why and I really hope the WoW team understands as well. It is crucial for them to put this in Classic. I 100% believe that they need to bring it back for BFA too. The combat in BFA feels so dull. This would really help the game out.
---
So what is the role of druid?
---
I mean, it has its place, but I don't think that place should be at the forefront of a conversation where most people seem to be voicing their opinions alongside the reasoning behind it. For a guy like me, who's a bit on the fence and has only seen vids of the beta, it helps to hear not only what people think, but why they think it. I think that's what divides a rational discussion and mob mentality. We express differing points of view and then reinforce them with arguments/reasoning.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
My point was you absolutely don’t need anything listed to successfully raid, not how to get into a top guild.  Its not bad advice for 95% of the entire player base.  Never had a problem clearing the same exact content we are about to get back so I don’t see how my experience would suddenly be irrelevant.
---
1- No. There will be a lot of people who know how/want to speed level. There will be more who don't know/don't want to do that.
---
2- Probably not if you aren't planning on speed leveling and/or already love the game so much you know you want to hop on. Give it a week or two for some of the launch kinks to be worked out.
---
3- Vanilla WoW is different than modern WoW. If you were able to give modern WoW 50 hrs worth of your time I recommend giving classic a shot, it's just the subscription price (don't have to shell out $60 or whatever for the game as well) and if after a month you still aren't into it you're just out a drunk trip to Taco Bell.
---
Something you should understand:
---
You can almost never have enough threat. Only when I would dual wield full world buffs with AQ weapons would the warlocks say they finally could just go as hard as they wanted.  That was just not possible for every boss for our guild, and certainly not for progression. So when you ask me "Can I hold aggro?", well there will almost always be a dps that could rip if they aren't careful. 
---
A human with similar gear levels of you will have more threat or more mitigation depending on how you itemize. A human is the more natural choice for TF as he has weapon skill. If you were competing pound for pound with a human tank for MT slot, the human would probably get it. But, it sounds like, for your purposes, you will be fine with whatever race you choose. 
---
Practically, I never felt like "I just don't have the mitigation to handle this boss", as  a night elf tank. If you are the main tank through each raid tier, you will feel well geared for the next tier. 
---
There are "tricks" to offset your lack of weapon skill. A NE tank can go ACLG+daggers for instance and he will have comparable threat to a sword using human since daggers make great threat, even more perhaps. Now, you are wearing leather gloves instead of tanking ones but its really not THAT bad.  The thing is, rogues don't like you taking their daggers. If you are in a guild that forces you to wear Quel Serrar as your only weapon for a long time, you will feel the impact on your threat.
---
It matters the most early on, when you are struggling to even be hit cap in prebis gear. You will have lower threat early on for sure. Go try to make a prebis tank list with 6 hit, and one with 9 hit to get an idea of what that looks like. 9 hit is really hard to obtain in P1. You can buy edgemasters though. 
---
Now, if you are an off tank instead, you could swing a Nightfall or Annihilator alot of the time and your human weap skill is meaningless. But if you are trying to stay second threat on the boss, you will really want that weapon skill. Off tanks honestly should do dps too sometimes and then obviously the weap skill is quite nice. 
---
Your mileage may vary in Classic. I was always world buffed for raid, ready with full consumes. If you want to play a more casual style in a more casual guild, threat will actually likely be more demanding since I believe world buffs/consumes make it easier to hold aggro overall. You get to benefit from the same dps increase that others do, but yours is 1.45x amplified threat from def stance. You also get a bunch of tankiness from world buffs that allow you to go harder on the threat gear.  If you have even 1 dps in your raid that tries hard, he will suffer alot if you aren't consumed/world buffed.  I never did get TF though :(.
---
Since everyone and their mother will have engineering you can't really do anything that none else can.. Unless if you get one of the rarer engineering patterns. The reflectors in particular can be sold for a decent fee, and go goblin to make sappers which is good AFK money maker.
---
Probably spamming or advertising in the wrong place I imagine. Some GMs will also be harder on some things than others, so he might have copped a bunch of spam reports from a sore loser then been suspended, and the GM was biased against it or just didn't know that it was technically allowed.
---
He grouped everyone he played with in a private server into one group. Re-read the context. He also said that if you're in a guild you can run it just fine. OP is referring to the fact that many people in the subreddit and just anticipating Classic WoW that it will be easy to stomp, which is not true if you consider the general population.
---
You mentioning top guilds is irrelevant because OP specifically mentioned (and implied) guilds that know each other aren't going to have issues.
---
Dagger is way way harder than swords but when mastered it's better. I'd recommend watching some perplexity to try get a better grasp of it, he is the without a doubt the best rogue period. Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Purp1exity
---
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya
---
This was the only class I managed to get to 60 pre BC
---
Yeah, but most servers just shove the populations together onto a single one and delete the listings for the older one. Blizzard's way is more of a half-assed one that allows them to point out that they've never reduced how many servers they have without lying.
---
A reasonable point.
---
I'd respond by saying that the 2 significant arguments against it are: 
---
A) those layers are still going to have a very significant number of people in them. I don't think that we should be approaching this from a perspective where each person is getting their own layer. The examples we were given when they were announced seemed to imply there would be something like 3 layers (I'd be interested to hear if there's evidence to the contrary). 
---
and
---
B) The layers are temporary which means that world PVP is likely to be less affected in even the short-to-mid term and when the walls come down after a few weeks (or however long), people's reputations or interactions are going to matter by the endgame for the majority of us.
---
Would like to hear what you think.
---
Did the stress test. Got to level 11 and tried RFC (yes underleveled priest I know). I was healer. Found 3 dps for me and friend rogue (level 11 I know is too low but we just wanted to try the instance before stress test was over). 1 Mage who knew what he was doing and how to cc/pull/dps. 1 Warlock who had VW on auto taunt, feared mobs into other mobs, bitched at the mage for pulling to much, quit halfway through. 1 warrior with a 2hander, didn't have taunt on his bars, quit after one wipe due to fears (may have been from him also it was chaos). So we replaced them with 2 hunters. (they didn't quit at the same time). First hunter was great, knew how to use pet to tank, pull, dps.... but then went afk after one boss and never came back. Second hunter came in for last boss... helped then suicided into the mobs once he died rather than run out... no real biggie. Mage and us parted on good terms thanking each other for sticking it out and had it been live I would have added to friends list. The others.... unlikely I would willingly party with again unless desperation required it. Lucky my friend and me will be priest/warrior so heals/tanking is taken care of and we just have to make friends with the "good" dps. (not how much dps they do but how well they work in a team environment, communication, cc etc).

The vanilla experience doesn't have 10 times the population trying to play the game on day one
---
What’s that? Consecrate? Oh roll paladin.
---
This is hilarious, Perplexity best rogue. Hahahahahaha
---
Well said.
---
I'd add that it's my assumption that a lot of people are blowing hot air at this point. The bottom line is, the only reason we have the layering is because of the hype. Most everyone wants to play on day 1. Most everyone wants a smooth experience. This solution seems to be a logical result of that.
---
Dagger rogue is my favorite and always the way i play. So much fun backstabbing and ambushing my way to victory.
---
Just feels like its the right way to play the class imo.
---
It's a setting you can enable.  It's not baked in.
---
I knew a hunter that was always on top of the dps meters, always, without fail. On top of that he was good and quick at pulling trash for us. There will always be room for a skilled hunter in my raids.
---
Do you have an aversion to seeing bots running all through the major farming zones farming the sort after drops?
---
Because that's the biggest source of gold farmers. No interaction, no community contribution, just a bot, on a script, taking your npcs and farming materials. 
---
How is this good, it's against the ToS. I understand it's not game breaking and ruins your life, but it has a negative impact I'd like to see gone. Not to mention the permanent spam in cities for gold. Report does nothing.
---
&gt;It destabilizes the economy as supply of resources fluctuate with the rate of the respawns.
---
&gt;
---
If anything it allows the economy to be more stable.  If prices go up to a point to where it is worth farming on your own, then you can easily go farm it.  If prices are low it might be worth your while to buy the item.  
---
Without layering in later releases majority of the upper level items will become part of a mafia that works to price set.  This means it not only are the resource you require unable to be farmed on your own, you have to farm other ways for longer periods to acquire the gold to buy the item you want in the first place.
---
In the early phases of layering there will be the same resource fluctuating that you described.
---
&gt;It discourages the incentive to group.
---
Encourages grouping to farm resources rather than individual farming a limited supply.  Supports a larger population, more people to group with. Layering let's anyone get resources without having to group.  Later on in other releases without layering there isn't an encouragement to group but rather a discouragement, as sharing would require you to split what you have, and isn't preventive of a player with a farm route on a timer (because the respawn is static).  Having to pay 100g for a stack of plague bloom is ridiculous, and will ultimately discourage players from remaining on a server or playing in general.  When layering stops there is going to be more people than resources to support.  This will ultimately crash server population to low levels, and create dead servers.
---
&gt;Creates dramatic swings in difficulty (sometimes there are 100 people and you play a game of who can tag fastest, other times you're solo and mobs repeatedly spawn on top of you so fast they kill you)
---
This is why it's called dynamic respawns, what you described is not dynamic.  This isn't to say there isn't a limit on how fast a mob can spawn either.
---
&gt;Encourages stale gameplay (standing still and killing the same spawn over and over)
---
When layering stops it's literally a game of who can tag the mob the fastest due to limited spawns.  Literally this is one of your complaints above.
---
&gt;All the above leads to far greater changes to the gameplay experience for far more people than layering. On top of that, it would be easier to leave enabled and not have the pressure to be removed that layering does.
---
Dynamic respawns using a logarithmic function can easily be tweaked and honed in, and if deemed to be too much quick have the limit changed that it would take the whole server to be in the same spot to force a respawn increase by a single node/spawn
---
Blizzard didn't even understand proper item stats for classes when wow first came out, I think the same applies for respawns.  With this re-release there is even more of a highly knowledgeable meta that  knows all the farm spots, techniques.  These will quickly weed out any casual player once layering stops.  Create dead servers and flop the game.  Players will be begging for layering to remain and if it doesn't and their server has died they will want sharding or server merges to link player bases.
---
I love hearing these stories of people enjoying my songs. Appreciate it man
---
dead region :(
---
Stone form. Dwarf ultimate race
---
Pretty much this. If you are tracking mining nodes or herbs you won't use it outside. Inside dungeons you'll come across the chests organically as you clear content with your group.  It's really only useful when trying to solo farm dungeons or when you've farmed enough profession materials for your current skill level and don't want to horde more in the bank. 
---
Stoneskin + vanish is pretty priceless for getting a one up on another rogue mid flight though.  This is more important than treasure finding in my eyes.
---
Plus Dwarf Master Race, duh!
---
You were the one originally talking shit about how "if it takes you 200 hours, you're doing something wrong".
---
Be a more obvious poser.
---
Yeah lets just mail our BoP items to a fucking bank alt
---
Man... some weird shit is happening.
---
I haven't played a blizz game in a long while. So I haven't opened up the blizz app since i heard beta dropped. I open it up just now and the download is their... So I'm thinking that maybe you can preload it now. I would check your app.

Your website had gone over data limit :[
---
I watched like 20 hunter duels this Sunday and it didn’t happen once so doesn’t appear to be that simple or broad if some bug does indeed exist.
---
Hell, classic doesn't even get its own tab in the launcher.  It's just a hidden drop down menu at the bottom =/
---
I guess I'll have to improvise
---
A ton of players will quit before hitting level 30, another large chunk of players will quit after clearing MC once or twice, after that there's nothing to do except raidlog, you could farm gold for consumes etc, but you don't really need consumables, so if your guild doesn't care you can clear the content in 1 raid night either way.
---
There's no honor system and even when it's implemented in p2 or p3 (don't remember) it's so bad it's actually embarrasing. All it does is encourage account sharing and the rewards might be cool looking, but running the same 3 bgs over and over will get tiring.
---
layering will be upped out the ass, you wont have trouble with leveling from the launch crowd
---
A lot of people assume that because it worked that way on pirate servers it will work that way in Classic.
---
We've already found one *major* error in pirate server code that made DW tanking way more effective than it should have been (5% parry on bosses instead of 15%). There could well be more.
---
I think you should assume for now that the Classic meta will be exactly the same as the real vanilla meta. People had spreadsheets back then, they knew what was what. Maybe you can DW your way through content you totally overgear, but I don't think we'll see it on progression content.
---
I think you're overestimating how successful classic will be. I wouldn't expect classic to have the player numbers it had back then 12 months in. Times have changed.
---
Lotteries and casinos were shut down around the midpoint of Vanilla and thank god.  Shit was annoying as hell and rampant with tons of fraud.
---
The Horde invaded another world on the behest of demons and countless people died. The Alliance defended their home. That's really all one needs to know, anything else is moral relativism.
---
Not enough to wear it should.make you reconsider your choice.
---
It works fine. Grenades are the beat for this.  You can use them while running.
---
I am guessing you are playing on a pirate server with bugged parry% and who knows what other bugs.
---
In real vanilla progression healers going OOM was a real issue.
---
As a holy pally in pvp, DON'T FUCKING CHASE ONE GODDAMN PERSON away from the group...looking at your warriors.
---
Because theyre 2 different games, like it or not.
---
Hey Melekith135,
---
Sorry about not saying why it is needed. Honestly, this isnt the easiest concept to understand (even with a programming background). It is even harder to explain it simply but I will do my best.
---
So a basic way to summarize that graphic is the following:
---
When we hit a button on the keyboard it causes actions to be taken. For example, hitting the 'w' key makes you initiate movement forward. These "Actions" are carried out on your client and they are also sent to the server so the server can know what you are "trying" to do. The server keeps track of these actions and updates other players of your actions so their clients can also show you in the right location doing whatever it is you are doing. So the takeaway here is that **actions you take, get sent to the server and the server sends you back information about other people or NPC's in the world so your client knows where to show them on screen.**
---
You have two players logged onto the server. Player1 (Client 1) sees the world rendered(drawn) a certain way. Player2(Client 2) also has his own rendering of what is going on in the world. The world Server (Realm) also stores all of this data in its own "view" of the world as well. So, the takeaway here is that **each client and the server have their own unique "view" of the world.** They are not necessarily the same, they differ in small ways. 
---
You see this in games when you think "Hey I was totally right on top of that player, i should have been able to hit him". The reality is, what you see on screen is not perfect and the higher your lag is, the higher your client data will be out of sync with reality.
---
So, actions take a certain amount of time to reach the server and updates from the server also take a certain amount of time to get back to you. This is called your ping (aka latency). Communications are not instant, and each player may have different pings to the server.
---
This latency or ping causes clients and servers to not "agree" with each other as to what is happening in the world. The way WoW is made is that the "server is always right". So gameplay checks are resolved there. But because the server data differs with client data, and blizard knows this cannot be avoided due to network latency, they had to built in a **leeway** into their gameplay code in order to make it behave closer to what both clients are "expecting" even with the delay in client and server communication. It is not perfect, but it allows for a 100ping player to play with a 300 ping player in what would otherwise be a totally unplayable experience.
---
As far as how much leeway should be in the game, I believe the leeway should be shortened in order to match with what vanilla was like. The pings for the players are generally lower today than they were in 2004. (This is backed up by a blue post as of 4 days ago)
---
&gt;By [**Aerythlea**](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?poster=Aerythlea) &lt;Community Manager&gt; [4 days ago](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=50941&amp;region=eu#728871) (Patch 8.2.0)[**Source**](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t//50941/6)[**#6**](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t//50941/6)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I’ve updated the original post in this thread with:  
---
&gt;“Melee leeway” is working as intended.  
---
&gt;After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.  
---
&gt;There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.
---
So blizzard has acknowledged that while there are more players with low latency now than in 2006, it seems like they are okay with the game playing a bit "longer" for those players. And by longer, i mean from Leeway. When moving it adds on yardage to combat the lag you might get from 100-200ms.
---
If you are below 100ms you will just start seeing hits registering "further" than your typical melee range because the leeway is allowing for it and you're communicating with the server fast enough that the leeway is actually giving you "too much" leeway. This isnt a big deal long term, it just means the distance will seem "longer". 
---
Well look at that. Another long winded post for something I was hoping would be a simple post.
---
It makes no difference if one rogue is human or not but if every raid member is not going for best racials it will be alot more noticeable
---
uhh... u mad?
---
You should give it a shot, you might like it.
---
I think that Classic is a little more challenging than modern WoW, and that challenge makes it more engaging and fun. It also encourages far more social behavior, which is part of what makes it worth coming back for more.
---
I agree with you fundamentally, but I think item cost being set by the raiders by bidding solves most of those problems more effectively. The dkp system outlined in that document seems very off for the values. Minimum dkp being that high for even a decent item is high. Especially when you start raiding multiple raids weekly with raiders who need different levels of gear. Some of your raiders may still need loot from MC and may get that gear quickly, while someone who doesn't have a lot of upgrades needed out of the current tier may not spend their dkp very quickly. 
---
I like dkp decay, but 20% is very very high. And the dkp decay per tier really doesn't make sense when you are already doing 20% a week.
---
Punctuation.  Kicking the goblin with a grunt, from your sword.
---
I got one on pservers as well, I got it in 3 runs which makes me think the drop rate was massively increased. Or I got insanely lucky. Using it to kill a 60 warrior at level 55 was a great moment.
---
Retail players are one thing, but something else are legacy players - people coming back, and resubscribing just for WoW Classic. 
---
There is likely a larger pool of legacy players than retail players in general, and I feel that is an audience that will unexpectedly breathe life into the game.
---
Do none of you guys realize resto druids exists? They do, and they can also cleanse, hibernate, root, battleress, while still healing a good amount. If a feral had to do all those tasks, his dps would go from bad to worse.
---
If your group needs more innervates or battleresses than what 2-3 resto druids and \~5 warlocks rotating soulstones can provide, then you've got bigger issues. Lowering raid dps by bringing a feral is not the solution to those issues. Lower dps=longer fights=more mana burned.
---
With regards to offtanking, a feral druid offtanking won't top the damage charts either??? A fury offtank can keep armor shatter or nightfall procs up AND they do far superior dps on the fights where they aren't required for offtanking, so why the hell would you rather bring a feral offtank? I struggle to see how that argument makes any sense at all.
---
As I said earlier, on paper the utility ferals bring seems great, but in actuality it's redundant.
---
Do you know what you will playing yet? What kind of server?
---
Simple Wood
---
I tried dabbling in some enhance raiding because I figured I’d see for myself what the numbers were like and if you play it properly you legit go oom so fast it’s actually hilarious. If you’re stormstriking, shocking, and totem weaving you go oom in like less than a minute. But you do actually do good damage for that brief period.
---
My suggestion 
---
Remove layering completely and lets what to come just come. We will deal with it.
---
What is the max population per server going to be?
---
Pservers have had thousands of people playing at the same time with not many problems? 4-7k players if im not mistaken. So whats the big deal with blizzard? They should be able to handle the traffic right?
---
Yea it can get crowded but who cares? You either deal with it or log off until traffic dies down.
---
I would rather wait in a que then deal with layering period. Even if that meant not being able to play . I want to see every single person on the server, not just a 1/3 of them. Fuck that.
---
The bottom line is we need specifics before we can even begin a rational discussion.
---
If you have 100% truthful specifics then what are they?

I think you'll really enjoy how immersive classic is.
---
I like it for caves and dungeons mostly.  When I'm out in the world I almost always forget I have it and use my find herbs/minerals
---
I don't care much for classic+, but I see why some would. I just think TBC is already improved vanilla, what makes them think these devs won't fuck something up in classic+ ?
---
Very.
---
I just fucking lmao because I actually did this from time to time.
---
I think they actually have the numbers and know what to expect in august.
---
I'm not just disagreeing with you, I legitimately belive we the players are overestimating classic wow interest.
---
Yes it's better than BFA, and there are no other mmorpgs out there that come close to vanilla- BUT there are hundreds of games out there that will draw people away and don't require so much time week in and week out.
---
I can't wait for classic to be my primary game for a long time, but I understand that most people don't feel the need to play a 15 year old game.
---
I feel like classic servers will all be released and then we'll see an attempt at making a WoW sequel with classic's flavor.
---
I'm sorry, I love vanilla wow and I want it to be successful but you're in for a rude awakening if you think there's a scenario where this game retains the majority of players from launch. It is not the game for many, many people. There will be a ton of tourists that just want to check out this piece of WoW history, but will be back on BFA within weeks if not less.
---
I love classic. I have been playing on and off again for almost half a decade now and i was hardcore throughout vanilla/TBC. But the thing is that even the largest private servers (which are free) have around 8-15k active players online during peak hours. That's nothing, literally less than one layered server. 
---
I can't remember or find the exact numbers but i remember it being like 30% of players that even reached lvl 60 on private servers.

The reason why I've only played "on and off again" is that classic gets pretty stale pretty fast unless you are one of those people that are willing to be in the cutting edge. Once you clear all the relevant raids for the week there isn't much else to do, yeah you can farm BGs, level alts etc but the novelty falls off pretty fast. I usually get to around BWL, then quit and rejoin once a fresh server launches.
---
And to be honest, the majority of "faithful oldschool player base" won't be coming back for classic. 15 years is a long time and most of them have jobs, kids and obligations now. The slow pace of classic won't really appeal to todays 13-25 year olds.
---
Like i said i love classic, i even took my vacation so i could play, but people are really overestimating classic. I do agree that having some ads would probably benefit classic a bunch.
---
&gt;If anything it allows the economy to be more stable. If prices go up to a point to where it is worth farming on your own, then you can easily go farm it. If prices are low it might be worth your while to buy the item.  
---
&gt;Without layering in later releases majority of the upper level items will become part of a mafia that works to price set. This means it not only are the resource you require unable to be farmed on your own, you have to farm other ways for longer periods to acquire the gold to buy the item you want in the first place.  
---
&gt;In the early phases of layering there will be the same resource fluctuating that you described.
---
That isn't how economics work as is evidence of this exact problem on private servers with dynamic respawns.
---
Mafias is a part of the vanilla experience, good or bad.
---
Layering means resource availability is relatively constant relative to population because layers will be collapsed/created depending on population levels. So no, it won't fluctuate.
---
&gt;Dynamic respawns encourages grouping to farm resources rather than an individual farming a limited supply. It supports a larger population, meaning there are more people to group with.  
---
&gt;Layering let's anyone get resources without having to group. Later on in other releases without layering there isn't an encouragement to group but rather a discouragement, as sharing would require you to split what you have, and isn't preventive of a player with a farm route on a timer (because the respawn is static). Having to pay 100g for a stack of plague bloom is ridiculous, and will ultimately discourage players from remaining on a server or playing in general. When layering stops there is going to be more people than resources to support. This will ultimately crash server population to low levels, and create dead servers.
---
Again, just look at private servers and you can already see how this isn't the case.
---
These problems all existed in vanilla regardless of layering. If you don't want to play vanilla that's fine, but Classic aims to be as close to vanilla as possible. And again, resources will be generally constant relative to population because layers will appear and disappear based off population of the realm.
---
&gt; When layering stops it's literally a game of who can tag the mob the fastest due to limited spawns. Literally this is one of your complaints above. 
---
The point I was making about tagging is the difference in difficulty that results from dynamic respawns.
---
&gt;Dynamic respawns using a logarithmic function can easily be tweaked and honed in, and if deemed to be too much they can quickly have the limit changed to the point where it would take the whole server to be in the same spot to force a respawn increase by a single node/spawn  
---
&gt;Blizzard didn't even understand proper item stats for classes when wow first came out, I think the same applies for respawns. With this re-release there is even more of a highly knowledgeable meta that knows all the farm spots, techniques. These will quickly weed out any casual player once layering stops. Create dead servers and flop the game. Players will be begging for layering to remain and if it doesn't and their server has died they will want sharding or server merges to link player bases.
---
You clearly have never played on a server with dynamic respawns. It's never going to be ideal 100% of the time. No amount of tweaking is going to get rid of the problems that are fundamental to it.
---
The fact is, dynamic respawns will alter the game far more than layering will. You're not smarter than all the devs at Blizz dedicating thousands of hours to this problem.
---
I am hoping for those versions of those expansions too but what would be really great is if we could take a copy of our classic level sixty toon for BC and then the same for WotLK. 
---
So essentially we’d have endgame for all three games at once with the same character being possible
---
Saving 1 talent point from +weapon skill and put into imp eviscerate instead
---
Psh, give me two really good pally healers over 4 mediocre ones anyday.
---
I’ve mained a Lock since Vanilla and I personally think Vanilla and TBC were the paragon of the Lock class. I’m NOT talking about spamming shadowbolt in raids (that build frankly sucks, and WoTLK had the best Lock builds IMO) I’m talking about the UTILITY.  My guild used to laughingly call me ‘Coach’ in early WoW because of how I could make mobs do laps. 
---
I could use a succy to seduce one, fear another and then juggle him back with Curse of Recklessness and at my peak I would be fear juggling two or even three mobs - allowing the mage and rogue to burn down the other mobs. Mages could only cc one mob with sheep, I could dependably be counted on to handle three mobs with cc. 
---
Vanilla Warlocks aren’t just about doing DPS, their utility is fucking phenomenal. Play a Lock well and you’ll be begged to do five mans even though you’re not doing the best DPS.
---
Not having layering is nice but queues really suck. Like if I have an hour to play before work and grind quests I can usually finish the quests for the zone and hs back netting me a good amount of a lvl if not more. With queues there’d be no reason to even log on in that scenario which would put me behind where I would’ve been.
---
For me, gonna be tailoring and skinning. I figured skinning is easy to level up since I'll be killing a bunch of stuff, and that can give me a steady stream of income. Tailoring means I can make my own bags and early 60 gear (plus a few other bits in between) and also sell bags which on a new server I think will be a great money maker.
---
The idea is, I don't want to have to deliberately go and seek out resource nodes. Both skinning and tailoring I can level up with just the stuff that drops off beast and humanoids, which has great synergy with grinding.
---
Trolls have that berserk hotness.
---
I remember the casinos!  When I first got on the game in December a few weeks after release on an RP server there were people setting up actual casino floors in Ironforge inside the taverns.  Within about 2 weeks Blizz banned it lol
---
The hunter pulled also but he just feigned.
---
hope u feel better bro
---
Why wouldn’t you reserve gear if people still join your run..
---
Naturally, two games which aren't the same means you have to be a shithead when talking about the one you don't like. Of course!
---
Well a shaman smart enough to peel off a healer in a dungeon is probably smart enough to know not to run away from the tank. If they're halfway decent they'll equip a shield and just soak up hits until the tank can get control again.
---
I liked the warcraft movie a lot. I have no idea why it got such a bad reception. It sure as shit is better than other video game movies.
---
Orc or undead
---
Orc for sure
---
&gt; They think it's going to make them more money if people don't rush to 60 
---
Has Blizzard actually stated that? And if LFR were to make them more money would the classic community be pro-LFR? That point seems to be another player vs blizzard.
---
&gt; They weren't purchasable in 1.12 is all the reason blizzard needs to not have them in 
---
Actually a waste of effort respond to considering gated content is in
---
&gt; people will start complaining that they aren't as special as they should be 
---
This is the real truth that people are trying to hide I think
---
&gt; I just gave other reasons why leaving them out makes sense because I  don't agree with there being no justifications to not just include them. 
---
I agree you can come up with reasons, they just vary in validity and persuasiveness. Like if you said "it means less dev work" well leaving out MC would mean less dev work too.
---
"Do you stand in the fire when you're not supposed to stand in the fire?" is a good yes/no checkbox.
---
The reality is that you should just practice 5 man dungeons until you can heal them in your sleep.
---
That's your baseline as a healer - if you cannot handle a 5 man dungeon, you won't be ready to raid heal. Even though raid healing can be easier than 5 man healing, everyone will expect you to react like a 5 man dungeon healer, should situations arise where the raid needs to split up.
---
The key to 5 man healing is prepping heals on the tank, all the time. If the tank doesn't need a heal, cancel, then prep the next heal. If someone else needs a heal, either finish the tank heal, or cancel and toss a hot if you can, or cast a heal if you cannot, then go back to tank healing.
---
Occasionally you'll root, mind control, slow, or stun a mob, as a form of crowd control, usually at the beginning of a pull, but sometimes in midst of combat, but that's the only thing you'll do besides healing. Heal first, crowd control second, when dangerous mob gets loose.
---
Don't dps. Don't dps. Let me say that again. Don't dps.
---
Eventually, you'll break that last rule, but you should be consistently completing 5 man dungeons with no wipes before you even think about dpsing.

---
Yeah I agree with this. I've been playing this game for over 10 years, i know it inside and out. I could make any class work and enjoy it. There is no objective way to select a class anymore. We know too much for objectivity to matter in the selection. When it comes down to it, with every class, even hybrid dps, if there's a will, there's a way. The raw numbers frankly don't matter compared to the effort you put into your character.

---
If they're willing to put our community as a guild ahead of themselves.  Classic is a team game people who are just after their own selfish interests are toxic for guilds. You need people willing to put the guild ahead of themself
---
Classic will have more players than retail
---
It's how you get to it for the stress tests, took me a little to find it.
---
That quote is from 2016. You’re enraged at someone’s POV from BEFORE THE GAME WAS ANNOUNCED. They have seen the hype. They have seen the subreddit, the beta, the YouTube videos, and the forums. The numbers won’t lie once it’s out. Many will try and leave but a huge population will stick around. This post is such garbage. I for one am stoked on the effort that’s gone into this project. They’ve fixed a lot of issues that players specifically pointed out and it continues to be that way. Your threat of saying its blizzards last chance to US, the people who fucking love this game, is beating a dead horse. Terrible post. Gtfo.
---
Only ever played classic, tbc, and wotlk
---
My English is bad sorry. What I tried to say is if 1 of 40 doesn't pick best race for his class it makes no difference in total raid dps (in case of rogue it would be like 0,1% total raiddps difference). But if 40 of 40 don't go for best race then it will make a huge difference in total raid effectiveness. That's why, imo, you should see the raid as a whole to min max, everyone should go for BiS racials.
---
The last one is the worst.  I keep them alive, drag the rogue that is on me through the dps and no one bats an eye.
---
Woah, he’s a lost cause.
---
You can spend those talent points on something else
---
I'm not really in the know about  Priest stuff. What's the story with Lightwell. It seems like a neat and unique spell. What makes it so terrible?
---
The best answer.
---
Where did they release that?
---
I was looking at Amazon and only found one, which looked grainy so I’m hesitant.
---
Sometimes though it's "A" healer not the healers but a raid lead can't call them out specificly.
---
No, thank you that was good insight and help. I played vanilla but was too young at the time to understand raiding and have raided every xpac since, so I am still wrapping my head around how vanilla raiding works.
---
Good they can pay me a few silver for the water/food and ports.
---
For sure underrepresented - I hardly hear from the younger perspective and can't wait to see how it actually fleshes out.
---
I fully expect to be 3-4 months into the game and having friends with kids 7,8,9 years old playing.
---
Classic has staying power for sure - it's the "lack of mystery" as someone put earlier that will dent the playerbase throughout it's lifespan.
---
For example I never raised naxx in vanilla but don't neccesarily see myself raiding naxx in classic - I would love to but idk if classic will keep me past phases 3-4... I hope they do since aq event was fun but there is no way for me to know if I'll be committed to classic after hitting 60, running dungeons and raids then eventually BGs in phase 3
---
... I've done those things and while they are extremely fun, there are games like Cyberpunk next year that will take me away.
---
We'll see, launch month will be legendary and that's all expecting of Classic, everything else for me is a bonus:)
---
How dare you insult Resto Shams like that
---
Nature protection potions
---
hunter:
---
* taming pets is fun, you gotta tame new pets to learn new abilities
---
* has to use a quiver and buy ammo
---
* focus is on long range, you will need to be positioned well in pvp and know how to kite
---
* has the more in depth DPS rotation, hard to master and is based on weapon speed. you want your autoshots to always go off and use other spells in between them (stings, multisots, aimed shots, etc)
---
* does more DPS early on, less DPS later
---
* less raid slots to hunters because you realistically only need 1 or 2 in an optimal raid. they are still required for tranq shot and kiting/pulling on certain packs and bosses, but they dont compare to mages in terms of DPS.
---
warlock:
---
* summons pets instead of taming.
---
* has to worry about soul shard management and potentially use a soul shard bag as well (similar problem hunters have with less bag space). although you cant buy soulshards from vendors so you have to farm for them. Addons like necrosis mitigate this because you can set a limit to how many soul shards you wanna carry while leveling (1-2 is usually all you need, the rest of your bagspace is better off used for trash, mats and questing items.
---
* in pvp they are more about face tanking then anything, your pet choice is crucial in matchups. your playstyle is about outlasting your oponent rather than kiting, although with CoE you can still kite.
---
* in pve their dps rotation is about as simple as mages.
---
* more raid slots to warlocks than hunters because of summoning, healthstones, soul stones.
---
* less dps early on, more dps later on, although mages are still gonna surpass you at all stages.
---
*Exactly!*
---
A bunch of sources have it but all you need is a sub to a new or existing account to play. No new game to buy and you have access to classic WoW and your retail characters.
---
Every single night on Stormrage there are literally 3-4 people standing on the crates in trade district doing gambling / casino games with the /roll function or those troll dice. These people make millions of gold off of it, its like a 60something percent favor toward the house so the longer the play the more they make, it's not a risk or anything to them, they just make money from people.. I've tried to get them banned for it but the GM's say that while it is a grey area it is not against the rules to even use say or yell chat to advertise their games and play their games. I really disagree with this because it makes the game feel really scummy but every time I speak up about it i'm shut down and told that i'm a carebear and I need to grow a pair. Oh well /shrug.
---
 I wish gambling and in game casinos was against the rules, but it is not. I have put in multiple tickets for this in the last year.
---
1: Not saying you're a newb/haven't ran that specific dungeon before at the beginning of dungeons. Most people are okay with it and will explain boss fights along with take it slow until you're comfortable. If they kick you out right away that's a shitty party leader who you wouldn't have wanted to be with anyway.
---
2: Running a guild effectively (if you want to raid not just be real casual) takes experience at the game and a lot of time (also alcohol because of people who stand in the fire). I recommend joining an established guild and learning the ropes, working your way up to being a class officer (top ranking member of your specific class in the guild, helps out the others of your class type to be better, pick whose in raids, mediate drama, and other things).
---
3. You keep them by maintaining the guild environment that people joined for. If someone joins a casual guild but wants to push endgame content, they're gonna grab some loot and leave your guild. If they joined to be casual and you start yelling at them for not being available to raid, they're gonna leave. Can't please everyone.
---
4- *Insert Chris Rock voice* There's a difference between newbs and noobs. A newb will tell their group they're new and the group will help them. A noob will pretend to know what they're doing and cause the group to wipe.
---
5- Learn what you can now then play the game. It'll be shaky at first but you'll catch on quick.
---
6- https://i.imgur.com/mlEuh8H.gif
---
Idk bout that. BFA is $50? Expansions are every few years? Declining player base?
---
$15/mo for subs would indicate retaining/growing their payer retention for the most amount of profit. 
---
Not to mention the cost of employment for developing a new expansion vs reimplementing old content with as you stated under supported staff. 
---
Therefore, I think the potential for their profits to increase are likely leading to additional support because at a certain point in business pride is subdued by profit.
---
Being new isn't that big of a deal wow pve isn't very difficult and with all the content presolved you could prep yourself for any fight in 10 mins.  The hard part of pve is troubleshooting and coordinating with 20/40 people finding out who isn't doing what they're supposed to and making sure they do.  This isn't a wow specific skill it's leadership and management skills so you'd know better than me if that's something you're good at.
---
Most people aren't going to have more knowledge of the game than a quick Google search can provide.
---
My advice though unless you enjoy managing people don't try to run a legit raiding guild, it really is tedious imo.
---
Then go play retail
---
Actually original and quality content. Thanks for breaking up the QQ’ing posts. Hope you write a couple more songs about your new classic adventures.
---
1. Too many to list, look up some youtube videos on wow etiquette
---
2. Not crazy, but likely not going to get enough people to complete a raid. Most will want someone that knows what they're doing, but there could be a market for those wanting only new players that have never played classic.
---
3. Varies, some do it guild only others do PuG. You potentially could fill for other guilds but loot issues can sometimes cause big problems when doing so.
---
4. Keep people happy. Poaching will happen, not much you can do about it if a players goals differ from the guilds.
---
5. I'd be willing to bet that most people will likely expect you to know stuff ahead of time. You'll probably want to convey that you are a noob prior to dungeon runs/raids.
---
6. I'd highly recommend knowing what build you want to play ahead of time. It's frustrating to put in a lot of time and then discover you don't like your class.
---
7. No idea, lots during launch but not sure how many will stick around.
---
I saw Midsummer and Midsummer Quests on the stress test. We got that!
---
Yeah the idea is that you're going to be running into familiar faces as you level and with layering it's the fact that you don't where anyone really is -there could be someone right in top of you and you wouldn't know it
---
I don't care about any of the named character costumes, I just really, really want the most generic set of Stormwind Guard armor they have. It's so beautiful.
---
You don’t need 2/2 Weapon Expertise, so the next best place to put that talent point is Improved Eviscerate.
---
Getting a 509 error when trying to access the website. Would love to check em out, did Reddit give you the ole hug of death?
---
lol
---
they were almost not designed for the game, considering how late some hunter stuff got in
---
Agreed! Assuming classic is a success and they don’t f it up, if blizzard was smart they would keep retail and classic as separate games like what’s currently intended but they should take notes on what makes classic great and model WoW 2 after it instead of retail.
---
*Boss approaches my cubical in storage room B*
---
Boss: "Is that a computer game?"
---
"No R tard, it's an MMO RPG.  These are real people I'm playing with..."
---
The Lightwell requires that raid members come over to it to click on it and use it. This is the only real interactable item that players have to use during combat, and it can be a pain to have to run over to it and click on it to get the buff. Additionally, it's a Heal Over Time that, if I remember correctly, stops upon taking damage. So it really is only useful during periods of a fight where raid damage was sustained, but there will be a break between damage long enough to make it worthwhile, which I would argue appear less often than periods of where the raid is taking heavy damage with no pauses in between. And to top all of that off, it's not a great heal over time effect either.
---
these were really really good, thanks.
---
Lol
---
Very nice job! :) I have been in the same spirits
---
legacy players are not pserver players. pservers do a decent job at recreating the game, but corrupt admins, insecurities if you character will still be there tomorrow and inaccessibility in general are reasons why unofficial servers could never be as popular as the official. most people that quit retail don't even know pservers exist.
---
uhhh, Undead.  There really isn't a better Horde race for a PvP rogue, though Orc would come in second.  If you were focused on PvE and wanted to min/max, I'd suggest Orc.
---
Will of the Forsaken is too good to give up and will make you stick to clothies like white on rice.
---
Maybe watch some YouTube videos on the different healers? Have you rolled on a private server to try out the classes ? It’ll be different from when classic comes out but I think a little bit better option then trying a healer on retail 😅
---
What class was he?
---
Do dungeon runs in retail and fail on purpose.
---
I keep myself awake at night sometimes thinking about my future Tauren Druid. I’ve been playing since vanilla but I’ve barely ever played horde side and barely ever played Druid, so I’m excited to try something new and relive my teenage years.
---
What part of farming consumables takes so much longer?
---
True, but I’d be absolutely shocked if it was 100k to start. The online engagement is bigger than retail + ff14 before launch.
---
1st of all, starting as a noob in Classic will be awesome. 
---
1st thing I would try to do is get comfortable with using keybinds to play your character.
---
In terms of guilds, starting a fresh guild would be fun, but the more veteran players will tend to side with more experienced players. However, don’t just think that you will be the only noobs around, the beauty of Classic wow was the discovery of new challenges amongst your friends. Keep that in mind as you progress.
---
I just don't understand your reasoning. There would be one popular realm with streamers on it and that would probably have a queue during peak hours, and then the rest of the servers would be normal. If you don't want to play on that server then just play on one of the other ones. Simple. That's how it used to be, so why would that be so terrible?
---
Oh that’s definitely where I’m coming from.
---
Didn't swipe have a target limit in vanilla? I remember it being 3 in TBC, unless you're stacking mad thorns-like effects you might be the one standing but your group certainly won't be.
---
I found a video of some BFA Raytracing so perhaps it would work on classic's client. Perhaps this will be the method we can use to make Duskwood darker? 
---

I think I have mine still. :) I might Ebay that beotch.
---
This would be the best case scenario because good mmos might be made again.
---
Dalrends is that good?
---
I've heard that at some point they downgrading their servers and basically this is their workaround to deal with the fact that they don't have the infrastructure to deal with a bunch of people interacting in the same area like they used to. But not really sure of the veracity of that information.
---
To be honest I have a sneaking suspicion that money is the root of this because otherwise why are they going out of their way to piss all of us off?
---
That's part of the appeal though. "Balancing" can have too much of an effect, where everything becomes boring and attainable for everyone regardless of skill.
---
It makes that jungle look so steamy and uncomfortable. Wish I could carry that feeling over to STV.
---
That's the price of a Budweiser in Denver.
---
Yeah man, the civilized world of Azeroth has the Church of the Holy Light, basically the Catholicism of WoW.  Human and dwarf priests and paladins belong to that faith, though some dwarfs are more interested in the mystery of the makers.  Night Elves have Elune, Trolls practice voodoo (watered down, thanks to Thrall), and the Forsaken had to convert to satanism after they died, basically.  The priest spells more or less go along with those religions.

For dungeon DPS while you try and get pre-BiS would you still put the time into farming MCP’s? This is one of the main things that have been limiting me on wanting to role feral DPS currently. I’ll put the time to get MCP’s for progression and key bosses but the work up to that I don’t want to have to rely on them too much.
---
So this question is interesting. It's about the deadzone, it always boils down to the deadzone. But honestly, it does not \*really\* matter. 
---
Reasons to roll Tauren:
---
1. You identify with it.. You accomplish goals in classic with motivation and effort, not mechanical skill. Whatever is going to inspire you to log on and reclear that MC for the good of the guild for the 25th time goes a lot farther than min-maxing the first progression. This is especially true with the hunter class. People don't get Rank 14 because they are the best players, they just put in the most time.
---
2. Warstomp is a cc racial ability. It's actually bonkers in certain situations. The extra hp is also fun to stack with the survival talent
---
3. You are a rare breed, and you will probably be more comfortable with your own tauren deadzone than others trying to exploit it against you (Make no mistake, relying on the opponent being bad is not a solid strategy, but it will happen in Classic)
---
Reasons not to roll Tauren:
---
1. Positioning is more frustrating in enclosed spaces. You might not be able to back up far enough to shoot targets.
---
2. In duels and open world pvp you will have it exploited against you simply because it is farther away, and it has a larger surface area.
---
In conclusion, you shouldn't pick any other race if you wish you looked like a Tauren everytime you log in.
---
I think this is great but horde and alliance banners on the same stick is blasphemy.
---
downranking is ez pz
---
especially if you heal dungeons as you level, that's how i learned to do it on a druid since with a pretty crappy set of healing gear &amp; feral spec i needed all the mana efficiency i could get
---
Find a high quality picture online and get it printed
---
Well there is no reason to not do classic + . You can choose to stay on classic server if u want you dont have to migrate your character over. Maybe they will mess it up maybe they wont.
---
You miss 100% of the shots you dont take - Gretzky!
---
Damn PvE servers look dead. Very cool though!
---
&gt; Having 50-100 less dps from your boomkin rather than a mage is literally irrelevant when the boomkin can sleep Dragonkin and entangle the large trash mobs that 2 shot full t2 in ruins of AQ..
---
&gt; 
---
The difference is more like 30% less DPS, not 50-100.
---
Yeah, I agree. And many like me who played for a bit to get a fix/reminder but couldn't invest for said reasons. I guess we can set the low end of the bar based on some pserver numbers?
---
It's gotta be hard to predict the player base, especially with the initial boost from non legacy players that can skew numbers, since they'll mostly leave "soon" after.
---
I can’t wait to play a game without item levels or gear score
---
Hell ya brother, life gets busy but I randomly get a 10 hour window at weird times that I would use to grind out professions or whatever.  Screw the dailies just make whatever it is take X amount of time and I’ll do it when I can.
---
I make my memes in Snapchat. Haven’t had the confidence to post any yet

in just a month's time you could repost this and change "sword rogue" to "hunter" and reap all the delicious upvotes all over again
---
Neat, thanks.
---
sadly yes
---
The correct answer is, OF COURSE.
---
That's a sick raptor strike!
---
Umm... and?
---
It's actually ex-military.  Gratz, though, it's the first time you got something right in this discussion.
---
I just don't invite other rogues when setting up an UBRS run so I will get it.
---
Classic good.
---
True, and I couldn't invest in pservers, especially after the Nost shutdown. 
---
Retail still has to be in the millions with subs right? or do you think that's too generous?
---
On a spaghetti shuttle
---
Someone else said this and until AQ40/naxx it's simply  not true  for a couple reasons : 1. Because the dps is pretty low overall 100 dps difference in phase one is close to 30% 2. The classes like mage lock and even warr and rogue to a certain extent don't start pushing huge dps margins until the gear becomes insane (as I said above, around AQ40, *maybe* after full BWL gear).

The lottery is regulated like gambling because it is gambling. Loot boxes and card packs have gotten away with the RNG in American courts because they often guarantee containing some of “rare or better” quality

Exactly.

I got Sul'Thraze on my ret in BC. It took nonstop running of ZF from 40-50. Best day ever.

Blizzard has a pretty good track record of paring down over populated servers.

Aragorn isn’t an elf!
---
Tauren hunter gonna get fucked by leeway really hard
---
&gt; There is likely a larger pool of legacy players than retail players in general
---
That is impossible.
---
It was also a quest for part of the Dungeon 2/Tier 0.5 gear
---
Sounds like you need FEMA.
---
They will not. I made a thread on this and someone gave me evidence that said they probably wouldn't.
---
Did they do dynamic respawns? Or was it just a huge orgy in the starting zones with everyone trying to tag mobs?
---
Swiftness potion is always a good one

Tell that to a rogue who bloodfurys while in stealth and ambushes you for 4K.
---
* Are you for it? For a very short period of time. Either layering for levels 1-20 or Layering for the first 2-3 weeks
---
* Are you against it? Yes
---
* How could the current implementation be modified to improve its functionality? See above
---
* What alternatives are there, and are they better, or worse? Better to have 1 world. Vanilla is the golden age of world pvp, why would we want magical different universes in the same game world that keep players from interacting with each other in any way?
---
&gt; servers released after 1.4 that never had the mounts 
---
servers released during later patches aren't analogous to servers which were not released during later patches.
---
Blue is not yellow
---
up is not down
---
I love classic dungeons and hate mythic.  In WoW, as in life, I'm generally deliberate and careful.  Biochemistry major.  Boring as fuck.  But you want me healing you.
---
Simpler, yes. Easier? No.
---
Can pull a whole Wing of a dungeon in retail and aoe it down with a few defensive and offensive CDs from the grp.
---
If you pull more than 4 mobs in vanilla you will wipe. Simple as that.
---
During vanilla WoW, about 10% of players actually stuck around.
---
I doubt we will get 40% retention now.
---
Unless they have something hidden up their sleeve, I doubt they have time to implement sharding by the end of August.
---
their world firsts basically don't matter at all
---
At first I agreed that it would be expensive but maybe for a palli or lock it’s fine due to saving like 1100g on 2 mounts
---
It’s somewhat rare but the hard part is huge competition.
---
I don't like the music and it takes ages to get anywhere
---
There is most definitely a rush to 60 especially among the population of players who will clear Naxx
---
I actually agree with you about leeway. However, I think the blue post is actually a bit more nuanced than it appears at first. This line in particular:
---
&gt; There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected. 
---
I believe what they are doing here is admitting it will be different. They tack on "for some" but I think that is more of a CYA type thing. Its a way of acknowledging that they understand how pings have changed. At least they are **acknowledging** it. In my opinion, they probably have data backing up that pings are lower, but it *seems* that they are choosing a "No changes" route here. The result is that yes, for low ping players, melee range is 7.66 yards.
---
However... I believe leeway has been now confirmed to apply to spells and AOE spells. So, effectively **everyone** has this extra 2.66 yards as long as the requirements of leeway are met (both models moving, not backpedaling etc).
---
This is why I use the phrase "The game will play 'longer' now". It is longer because every distance **will be** 2.66 yards longer. I never understood this when I was originally playing. I always took the particle effects as indicating what would be hit (AOE frost nova for example).  It always perplexed me when people were frozen who appeared so far from the edge of the spell. It was because of leeway and my ping being 50-80.
---
Again though, for players running 100+ ping it probably helped make things look "more natural".
---
I hope blizzard can do an open beta and perhaps tune spell batching and leeway using the ping data.
---
The reality is, blizzard probably made a mathematical calculation to figure out what leeway distance would be best for the most players. I think if they recalculated it to take into account the "pings of today" you would get a lower number than 2.66 yards and I think that would be a win for everyone.
---
First aid is pretty easy to level after 60, just go aoe grind humanoids for cloth to catch up to runecloth.  Also very important for raiding, being able to bandage yourself prior/after a known damage source is pretty nice.
---
then dont
---
I forgot what video I heard the druid song in but I played it on repeat for over hundred times that weekend back in '06 or '07. Definitely one of my favorite songs ever.
---
I agree with this as well. I was so soft that I would sheep heal and make friends with the horde.
---
Why is that sad? That we dont have to sub to both games individually? I for one am happy to get 2 games for the price of 1
---
D3 at launch was the only time it was a playable game.  :)
---
Thank you!
---
I don’t really disagree with you but got to add there are plenty of collecting professions that could finance your leveling. I’m personally planning on doing engineering right away as well with a collector profession to help pay for it.
---
Sounds pretty harsh but it would be pretty cool to watch and see the progression good luck man
---
With a name like that you've gotta be playing a Tauren Hunter
---
That happened with cataclysm and the general players rejected having to possibly die a few times before accomplishing something.
---
Farming elemental fires from those mobs so dope
---
I have my eye on warlock as well
---
I think this is highly likely if blizz doesn't have a miracle cure for retail
---
Recently fell below 1 million. Which is incredible because it was 12 million in wrath of the lich King. Just goes to show that everything they've done to the game has been wrong.
---
Let them come :)
---
\&gt; This is something that I think would be fun to do
---
Yeah that feeling will pass within in a couple days when you realize people will gladly pay money to continually troll you to the point you never get anything done. 
---
\&gt; start my journey to 60 and then journey to rag.
---
No guild is going to want you tanking raids for them when your talents, gear, and everything else is just one big troll imposed by your viewers. You will NEVER be competitive or wanted.
---
Its probably not innacurate. I haven't seen a toilet in any alliance town.
---
I'm jealous your cost of living is so low...
---
$7.50 could almost be called cheap for a beer lol
---
&gt;IT’S NOT ROCKET SURGERY
---
I bounce between MM and survival at 60. I prefer to play survival as it find it funner and if I know i'll be running dungeons or pvping I stick with it.
---
Can't deny the impressive burst that MM brings though
---
Check their hobbies ingame, ask what they like to do in their free time.  I want to know if they enjoy fishing all the time, camping lowbies in STV all day, AH flipper, run friends through dungeons, rare recipe hunter, etc.  That's as good a personality test as any.
---
I would rather not waste both our time trying to recruit a guy that only does premades and PvP ranks all day, if my guild is focused on getting everyone BIS for raiding.  He might wanna join because the raid times jive with his schedule but honestly there's no way he's going to be compatible.
---
It had to be finished properly.
---
Because people realize they don't want to play a game that was designed 12 years ago, the idea of  a classic wow is really a double edge sword, on one side you play with your memories on the other you play with an old game and all the bad design / bugs / imbalances there was, maybe wow lost its social aspect over the years but it improved a lot on many other side.
---
I certainly hope so. I'm in the no beta-club, but that boomstick sound is half my immersion when playing a dwarf.
---
I believe
---
I'll try my best to make it work, my goal isn't to screw over other players just myself.
---
&gt;It looks very stupid in the Warcraft setting.
---
it literally exists in the warcraft universe
---
Don't you farm herbs mainly?
---
&gt; The intention is to have it for only the first some weeks and while players are still in the lower level zones. 
---
Layering does nothing for low level zones since it puts a server-amount of people on a layer. If the starting zone happens to be packed on day 1, layering will not help. The intention of layering is make megaservers so that, as tourists leave, enough remain to form a solid server population. 
---
I expect that it will be on all the way through phase 1 and I expect that, when they have more people still playing than they anticipate, they will not be able to cleanly turn it off at the beginning of phase 2. At that time they will tell us that they had a choice between splitting up servers OR leaving layering on and that it will be left on indefinitely.
---
You dun double Druideded.
---
The average Pserver hardly lasts though, everyone is constantly rerolling on the newest and greatest ‘fresh’ server. Classic is the newest fresh server but what about after 6/12 months and people are starting to get bored?
---
Sounds like jack ass meets wow lol
---
Agreed, but I still think it is advisable to always be hit capped. Missing an aimed shot can significantly tank your dps, especially in dungeons when the encounters are shorter.
---
People don't DW for survivability, so nothing really changes, DW is still higher threat.
---
I actually prefer blackcrow. I run with a slightly modified setup as my prebis compared to most guides. Maybe I'll make a video about it!
---
LFM UBRS FULL ON ROGUES AND WARRIORS was common on my server in vanilla. People who think this is just a 'private server' problem are delusional.
---
Wow, really? Gotta source by chance?
---
I appreciate the interest. You're just being studious. The more you know about them the more you can beat them up in PvP right?
---
I agree with this also.
---
I think they have released Retail has run its course and they should restart. I wouldn’t mind a Starcraft MMO.
---
Glad you enjoyed. Big fans of some dotes myself.
---
Interesting point, maybe classic will kill retail afterall.
---
The problem with quip is that it's not acknowledging the people who left the game because they stopped playing retail. Those people aren't going to say "the game is so much better now" because they don't want to play the current game.
---
&gt;Do their "analysts" expect people to mass quit after Phase 1 when Vanilla itself had extremely high retention and Vanilla private servers have been going very strong for more than a decade now?
---
To be fair in regards of private servers, many of their communities are in a state of constant flux due to shutdowns and popularity migration. I'd say most long-time private server players have restarted multiple times over the years. So, naturally they have been playing a long time when their progress keeps getting reset.
---
A sobering analysis
---
It was 1.7m last September and I remember a discussion like a week ago where people were saying it had just fallen below a million. I'm too lazy to do any more googling.
---
This is a business - they don't want to jeapordize their current product BFA that in theory should be better than classic.
---
At the end of the day they are trying to protect their current product BFA because they have invested millions for the next 6-12 months most likely. So untill they see the return on classic they don't want to jeapordize their investment on BFA. 
---
Maybe once classic blows up and they realize the potential and money to be made, they won't do anything more then they have to. If classic isa massive hit, they may have to rejig their whole business and business model.
---
I enjoyed the patches where Blizzard couldn't decide if Blood or Frost should be the Tank spec.  So they made them both DPS with all the tank abilities while they figured it out... for a year.
---
It's like mccuckle
---
Who knows but if blizzard is smart and paces out releases they will get atleast 2 years out of classic before they figure out what they need to do next. (WoW2 is my hope)
---
No, but I'm assuming by "legacy players" we were talking about anyone who used to play not private server players
---
Almost!
---
As a matter of fact, that is where the name came from. I was a Tauren Hunter back in Vanilla. Well at least he was one of many alts, but one of my favorites.
---
There is no conversation.  Layering will be in the game.  End of discussion.
---
So instead of wasting my time explaining for the billionth time _why_ it sucks, I'm just going to stick with "fuck layering".
---
AWESOME DUDE
---
Because the value of stats changes depending on your current gear and buffs if you want a solid answer you need to use some spreadsheets or simulators to get your answer, but that being said [Shadowpanther](https://shadowpanther.net/) has some nice charts mapping the values of items to Agility equivalence. For example [Perdition's Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18816) is valued at 378 AEP and [Glacial Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19099) is valued 287 difference of 91 AEP. So in this case the weapon upgrade/downgrade is same as losing or gaining 91 Agility from other sources.
---
you can totally make that
---
Didn't go through your post history. I was responded to comments of yours reported by other users.
---
I be Zen'kiki, mon! Look at us slinging wand and arrow side by side. Bruddahs bound by blue braids!
---
because everyone would chose those servers
---
I’d like to think of less as balancing and more filling in the gaps. Give all classes a racial spell. It’d add so much flavor. Make the terrible specs (moonkin, ret, enhancement) at least somewhat viable. Buff the other tanks just enough to make them a real option sometimes. Honestly there’s not much to do but some tiny tweaks would go a long way. There’s no good reason that some specs should be mathematically drastically inferior.
---
Ahhh yes the old "you made a typo so anything you say is useless"
---
Opinion: Blizzard wants classic to fail so they’re keeping in layering
---
A place of conversations.
---
It was a great addition, but I agree it would have been cooler if a couple other classes got the same.
---
It's not a typo if you make the same 'typo' three times. It just shows lack of interest.
---
This is why server community and a good core are going to be essential, to avoid PUGing. I ran most of my dungeons at 60 with guildies, so we could negotiate who would get what drops first. “I’ll pass on Dal’Rends if you give me the first HoJ and/or Ironfoe”.
---
Horde NA PVP  
---
Let me start off by saying I have taken the entire week off of work for the launch of classic wow. I plan on playing an undead warrior and am looking for a group of people who are willing to spend 15+ hrs a day grinding 5 man dungeons with me until 60. I want to run a melee cleave so am looking for 2 melee (warriors/rogues), an enhancement shaman, and an priest for filling out the group. Please DM me if you're interested in a hardcore grind session to 60.
---
At 10:24 Akustin and I managed to snake our way up some hills about 40 ft. I started drinking and rezzing but the Alliance found there way up and washed over us. It was a nightmare. I tell you though I have some Screenshots defending Deadwind Pass from Asmongold I posted right after the server went down and some of myself in Stormwind during the final moment's I'll post now.
---
Riding a mount and jumping at a leaving zeplin and landing on the platform on the back was such a great feeling.
---
I mean the obvious answer is flask recipes especially flask of the titans. It is a small % chance to drop from Drakkisath and in all honesty if you're lucky enough to have it drop then you can write your own pay cheque, especially if you're one of the few on the server that can craft it. 
---
Other than that other profitable recipes I found back in Vanilla were Major mana pots, elixir of the mongoose/ogre strength, free-action pots.
---
You're an angry dude.
---
I really hope they at least do some fun advertising for Classic.
---
Not only should they be able to, it should be expected. Just hire some security for the next tournament if they want to keep out the riffraff
---
Inspiration. Why would you take inspiration when pretty much the rest of the priests will have it. It seems redundant to have it getting applied over its'self.
---
yeah ofc, that won't be the issue. but you will have 90% useless layerservers because most people want the actual vanilla experience.
---
Fun for you, not for anyone around you. There was an addon that blocked the sound it was so annoying.
---
Thank you so much my friend, I think this has helped me finalise my decision on rogue. I didn't realise/think that a lot of rogues wont be going for the daggers. I actually thematically always preferred dagger spec, however, don't mind going swords for the min max. I think that is what I will do, go daggers as I'm happy for a bit of dps loss for an easier time at weps and maybe once no one really needs the swords (if thats possible) I can get them that way.
---
They should be able to see who didn't buy or activate their latest POS expansions too
---
JFK and Lincoln didn’t think their events would be grieved... look at what happened to them
---
You sound fun at parties
---
Something controversial?  Not on my Reddit!
---
Emphasis on 1: 
---
**Wiping in a BFA dungeon sets you back twenty feet.**
---
**Wiping in a Vanilla dungeon will set you back twenty minutes.**
---
If you don't know a fight, say something well before the pull. The cost of kicking anyone mid-dungeon is always high, but still infinitely more like to happen *after* you've caused a wipe.
---
I'm a "that's the wrong glass" kind of guy. Lol
---
Alliance!
---
I used to frequent Buffed quite a bit when I was younger. Was my one stop shop for all things WoW. Once my English got better, I moved away but I'll indulge in some Buffed stuff, sure, why not. Loved the forums back in the day.
---
I believe that THEY think the impression of classic will be worse if they don't have layering..But maybe it is about saving money
---
I think of it as "surprise" appearances in wrestling shows.
---
But honestly, it baffles me whenever someone gets genuinely upset about their events being crashed on a pvp server. They may as well staple a printout of SurprisedPikachu to their face. Why do they never have the foresight to round up some pvp guilds willing to be bouncers?
---
It's up to players to run security for events, not GMs.
---
I got lucky once or twice and somehow was hovering on the side of the boat, all the wya to the loading screen. I’m pretty sure though when I got to the other side after the loading screen, I got tossed into the water and had to swim the rest of the way
---
To be fair, that's not entirely true.
---
The game's just played out. It's too old. You can only do so much with the underlying technology. How many more fucking tank swap fights before people finally get sick of it?
---
Every game has a limited shelf life. It's insane that WOW lasted for 15 years.
---
I think something Blizzard, and a lot of other people seem to miss here, is that there is literally no MMORPG out there that uses the same philosophies as old WoW did. The game design philosophies that made the game the best MMORPG experience the whole genre had to offer, to the point where it became a cultural phenomenon and attracted the "niche" audience of up to 12 million players at its peak in WotLK.
---
And even before then it easily trumped modern WoWs subs by the millions.
---
The downfall began as Blizzard (and alongside it, every other company) moved away from the original MMORPG recipe of success at the end of WotlK, starting with LFD. 
---
They stopped designing for players wanting a true WoW journey, and started to focus completely on getting to the "good stuff" in endgame as fast and easy as possible, sacrificing the whole appeal of WoW's genre to create a weird amalgamation of a single player/multiplayer ARPG grinding game.
---
The MMORPG parts in the modern WoWs are almost gone completely. It's an entirely different game, and quite frankly seems to have an identity crisis. One that still has an audience, but it's a very different crowd from the traditional MMORPG one.
---
If people wanna play the best game ever designed for specifically the MMORPG genre, they'll get that in Classic. No other game out there can and has tried to provide that in years, up until this day. 
---
People who love that MMORPG style will absolutely adore Classic, no matter what age, whether they've played it before or not. 
---
It's a very unique game, and one that defines the peak quality of the genre that since has been perverted into something completely different, yet still calling itself an mmorpg when it's not. The original playerbase shows that they are aware of this both vocally, and by not playing the games companies try to sell them as such.
---
Going to smite as much as possible in Molten Core. Holy fire will be saved for sweet finishing moves on bosses.
---
That's German grammar for you. it should translate to something like "You kick the body of the goblin off of your sword, all while grunting heavily." 
---
It's not the sword that grunts in this context, but seriously, the AI has become amazing. These 2 languages work *very* differently, bravo translation AI people!
---
It's more like a piece of shit and classic for the price of classic.
---
It's so painfully obvious what they're planning. 
---
The next WOW expansion is going to be marketed as a return to form, it'll bring back a ton of mechanics and design philosophies from the original game (talent trees will come back...just watch), and they're hoping that they can transition people from classic to it.
---
That's the whole reason they did classic. They're hoping it's a gateway drug.
---
&gt; They'll play what's the best stat wise, not what they want.
---
I mean whats the best stat wise IS what they want to play
---
The issue is that the feature (or at least the future removal of it) demands that people do leave in mass.
---
Sorry, but there is no guarantee that people will leave more than they join, especially in the first few months.  It is completely illogical to not take the possibility into consideration.  
---
Keep in mind that OSRS has only ever gained players as an old game (although, the end of the second year before content updates/votes there was a dip).  Perhaps people are sick of gaming now days.. and the MMORPG market has sucked absolute ballsack as well; vanilla likely wont be as big a hit as it was back then, but instead of a growth of 7 million in 2 years, who is to say it doesn't start with 500k (just as an example) and slowly make its way up to 1 mil concurrent players by year 2.  
---
It makes no sense to me that people are automatically dismissing a very possible outcome.
---
This should be ok if you throw some candels their way every now and then just as a good will gesture.

they even implemented a loot delay so you cant loot everything instantly xDDD

Been part of a Red Dead Online group - since they haven't given us a creator tool like GTAO we have to improvise our own fun. Whenever we're doing something we have a few people posted up as security.

Then you think "well, I'll take the opportunity to use the restroom" and you come back just in time to see the boat leaving again.
---
Though I would imagine the business folks at Blizz/Activision will parse the data enough to know how many subs are primarily for classic vs. how many are primarily for retail, based on playtime.
---
i say you just roll with Gnomergan. fuck the haters
---
Back in vanilla, when I was 12 and a NE hunter, I rolled against multiple rogues and warriors for that pair of swords.  And when I got them, I put Fiery on them because it looked cool.  Sometimes I would walk up and melee bosses in dungeons just because.   😎

I'll end up in the other extreme...

`Lactolas`

`&lt;Cowncil of Elrond&gt;`

That's an interesting point, thanks.
---
With leeway theyre trying to ruin the game intentionally perhaps?
---
They surely understand classic wow as a money maker can't compare to the failing pile of garbage that is bfa. Maybe it's intentional.
---
Ooh, imagine if every player had a base camp they could design and put various NPCs in to do different things. You could have portals, or a forge, or a garden. I know! We could call it a garrison!
---
That's a epic pic haha
---
&gt; People don't DW for survivability,
---
For whatever combination of reasons, pirate server content is so easy for high-end guilds they don't seem to have to do *anything* much for survivability. Yet in real vanilla progression guilds did.
---
So have the pirate players discovered a tactic that nobody at all in 2004-2006 discovered, despite the 2006 folks having the same spreadsheets and whatnot *and* direct access to live vanilla servers for testing and logging? Or are the pirate server crowd exploiting bugs and non-Blizzlike gameplay to smash trivialised content?
---
We won't know until people try it in Classic, but my money is on the second option.
---
&gt; DW is still higher threat.
---
Sure, it's higher threat. But in real vanilla, the consensus was that your tank would get smashed or your healers go OOM. So you didn't do it.
---
Will it be that way in Classic? Well, we'll have 1.12 mechanics on our side which real MC progression raiders didn't when it was relevant content. That will make a huge difference. But even in 1.12 fail guilds still couldn't clear Rag.
---
My guess, and it's only a guess because Classic is not live yet, is that "lol nothing matters let's DW" will not be a viable tactic for progression. But we will see.
---
I never knew of this channel but it does not look like it works in the beta.  I tried a few variations but /**WorldDefense**  doesn't seem to do anything.
---
Oh they’re going to mess with it.  They’re game devs.  The develop stuff.  If you think they’re going to say “welp, we restored classic and now nothing will ever change” you’re going to be disappointed.
---
Vanilla is my favorite ""expansion"" but i can't stand the journey to 60, leveling has never been fun. It's necessary to be long because it builds experiences, friendships and helps you learn the ropes. But on vanilla it's just so slow and takes forever to get from A to B without a mount. I feel like the reason new expansions sucked was because PvP got worse, wPvP in particular. Flying Mounts ruined the world. Classes lost their appeal and they all started to feel simillar. Abilities began to be balanced around rated PvP thus removing a lot of their fun and in later expansions even melee classes could heal. Everyone needed an interupt or two, 3 escapes, multiple gap closers etc. Specs felt less different from eachother, tons of abilities were pruned lowering skill ceiling. Spell ranks were removed, professions were made useless, LFR, Raid Difficulties. I could go on for days, but my point is that it's not just this notion of "Classic was good because of the journey". The journey to 60 was probably my least favorite part of the game especially once you've already done it once on each faction. The meat and potatoes is the community, Classic is the best at building friendships with how you have so much content that needs to be done in groups, no flying so you run into players out in the world all the time and have less automated systems forcing players to talk to each other. The best time in classic for me is once you get a few blues and can start grouping with friends to do PvP and dungeons/raids with. The sense of progression and community is what really makes it great.
---
now it is
---
As a hunter, I agree.
---
To be fair, a couple million subs isnt really "failure", but it's definitely a farcry from WoW's heyday. Their chances have hurt subs, however the market has also been flooded within the last 5-10 years and subscription models haven't aged well.
---
&gt;The downfall began as Blizzard (and alongside it, every other company) moved away from the original MMORPG recipe of success at the end of WotlK, 
---
At the start of WoTLK\*
---
Wrath was the beginning of the end. Sub numbers didn't decline because the rot hadn't set in and the story of Northrend kept people captivated, but the growth did stop. Population essentially plateaued as soon as Wrath came out. So many problems with WoW started in Wrath, people just didn't accept it at the time. They still don't.  (Well, some did. A lot of hardcore players threw in the towel after T7 was the worst, most laughable tier ever released). Wrath is consistently rated as the best Expansion but It was without a doubt the beginning of the end.
---
I wish you all the best for your future OP! Get well soon and I hope classic wow will bring you some joy! Keep strong buddy the community stands behind you &lt;3
---
Dont want to be grieved? Then roll a pve server. Pvp servers are for keeps.
---
The hands thing is a “chakka brah”...
---
real-life map != life-size map
---
Just because you don't like a game that millions of other people subscribe to doesn't make it a POS. Just thought you should know. I assume english isn't your first language or you'd know how it works.
---
Which race/mount do you think looks cooler?
---
It’ll be funny when you’re wrong and then fall back on “well classic is different than vanilla was so that’s the real issue.”
---
You're EU? Also, which class are you playing?
---
It seems like they should offer an opportunity to get these again, even if they restrict them to wow classic only (like wow classic collectors edition)
---
I've tried it out, and it works. Just got to work together as a group
---
The paladin epic mount quest chain costs atleast 800g.
---
You aren't the PC language police. It's a pirate server. The server is illegally using Blizzard's IP without permission, and even if the people using the client downloaded it legally in 2006 and not illegally afterwards (ha ha I crack me up), it's still a use of the client that breaches the license conditions. 
---
If you get offended when people call a pirate server a pirate server maybe you aren't quite ready to be on the internet.
---
You need Rank 6 or something to use /worlddefense
---
Don't worry, using the magic of "analytics" Blizzard will know which game you actually play. If someone was going to "leak sub numbers" they'd probably leak the analytics data instead. And Blizzard will certainly be making decisions based on the real data because despite what some of you people think, they aren't trying to make a bad game that everyone hates.
---
Always lol at people who say pirate  server.  Wtf is a pirate  server
---
Didn’t know that
---
Hot fucking damn, I didn't know it was available!  I just installed it just so I could trip out over downloading WoW again.
---
I set the graphics to Classic mode but I'm going to be screwing around with them a lot.  With all those settings, I'm looking for "original Vanilla but a little better".  Maybe the Classic settings plus higher antialiasing would smooth out those jagged edges on foliage while retaining that old look and feel.
---
But yes, if they don't give Classic its own tab in the launcher then Blizzard is fucking up in a big ugly way.  Promote this thing!!
---
Not sure what you mean man, this is a genuine concern of mine. I’m not actually trying to bait anyone.
---
I added you on Discord just for the testing part of you're interested.
---
Atm, we're still figuring stuff out. We have some candidates, but still in need of more players
---
For example I would put lower rank Greater Heal heal as 1, then the higher rank as shift-1 and put the heal on top of the numbers bar to make it easier to visualize. Next spell as 2, shift-2.
---
Getting the opener is more important than poison immunity on a cooldown for the mirror match
---
That’s a good point, I was thinking more about the community managers. Of course there is always going to be top down pressure on everyone to promote retail and increase subscription rates. I haven’t played or followed the game since 2011 (until the last month or so)
---
Best roll PvE streamer bois
---
&gt;Are they seriously underestimating Vanilla's potential? The legendary MMORPG that shook the gaming industry?
---
They're taking a conservative approach because they have no idea how popular Classic will be. No-one does. Private server numbers are useless because private servers are free. Plenty of people will gladly play something for free, but ask them to cough up some cash and they'll baulk. On top of that, there's the anti-Blizzard sentiment in much of the private server community, and online in general, that would definitely make them question whether many old players would even come back. 
---
Then consider that WoW shook the gaming industry 15 years ago. It was an amazing game for the time, and it single-handedly exploded the MMO market, but the online marketplace is very different now. Many modern players *expect* features that Classic will not have; cash shop cosmetics, exp boosts, cosmetic character changes. Much as we might despise Josh Allen saying players might log on and then say "Wow, the game is so much better now", there are plenty of players out there who will think exactly that. The simple fact that loot is not personalised and specs cannot be changed on the fly will be a no deal for a great many players. 
---
Now, there is a counter-point to all this. The modern gaming market *is* saturated with games full of microtransactions and a lack of meaningful progression. There's a good chance that there's a body of gamers out there who are crying out for a game like Classic, where you can't jump ahead using your credit card, and where hard work and dedication are rewarded. It's worth saying that quite a few streamers who were invited to the beta were not fans of Classic, but after they tried it they admitted to their surprise that they actually loved it. That may very well be the experience of many other players too, who might find that the restrictions in Classic are something they actually enjoy. 
---
Ultimately though, no-one knows what will happen. Blizzard is taking the conservative approach, which is understandable, and only time will tell whether it was the right approach or not. I hope Classic will be wildly successful, not because I want Blizzard to be wrong but because of the entirely selfish motivation that I want people to play will.
---
I like this comment for all the reasons.
---
Maybe he wont. Blizz could offer a Vanilla no changes server just for them.
---
Get a real mouse pad or get outta my hogger raid.
---
From what I've experienced on rolling a 60 priest is it's not only easier than what you make it out to be but a lot of fun too! Especially with updated macros available you can declutter your action bar by making one spell utilize 2 or 3 spells. For example by using shift or control button modifiers you can now have the last 3 greater heals available. Let's say it's on your second slot action bar, make shift your previous rank and Ctrl your 2nd previous rank. There's a lot of versatility today than there used to be. You can even use "Discord Action Bars" and create hidden action bars that have the same effect without using macros. Although this doesn't solve your problem with keybinds it does make for a fluent healer and as you learn your spells effects you will naturally know what rank to use with a simple modifier, preserving precious Mana!
---
That's a bit if a slippery slope fallacy. No one is saying change talents, skills, mechanics, gear scores, or anything like that. There's no game breaking reason that after Naxx they couldn't add dungeons/raids that are side-grades to others. Is it vanilla? No, but you can 100% ignore those aspects and still have a completely intact vanilla experience.
---
Dude even with increased parry chance or whatnot all content will be cleared the day it comes out. This isnt "vanilla" you keep stating that real vanilla healers went oom etc etc. Its 15 years later and we have the strats and fights figured out. Your right alot of the data could be off, but it still doesnt change the fact that people have been doing these fights for the last 10 years ad infinitum
---
We're definitely going horde, so a paladin would be out of the question sadly :) 
---
If you want to join the testing group as either priest and warrior or two mages, then hit me up :)
---
Seems like you are getting downvoted for stating the truth.
---
Can't view, rip
---
"shook" not shake. It was good for its time. I would say a large majority of players that try Classic will immediately do what the dev mentioned. "Wow, this is no where near as good as retail." and log out.
---
It's only nostalgia, and social/community based players that will thoroughly enjoy it, in my opinion. I am going to play Classic, because I love many aspects of it, but there are many reasons I will still play retail also.
---
At the end of the day, people want to log in and have fun and everyone's idea of fun is different, but there is way more things to do in retail, which is why I think that majority will revert to it.
---
&gt; It's only a viable tactic for actual good players and arguably in good gear so yeah not everyone will do it. 
---
I think that's a questionable claim. You don't need to be some kind of Olympic-level cyber-athlete to mash a DW DPS rotation while standing in front of a boss, or mash frostbolt a few seconds sooner than you would mash frostbolt if the tank had a shield.
---
This isn't about player skill, or at least I do not see how it possibly could be. This is just about whether the tank will stay alive and the healers not go OOM.
---
Similarly, if anything healing at high throughput is easier than low throughput. You don't need to worry about downranking or cancelling, just spam big heals until the boss dies or the tank does.
---
It's still really popular in Asia.
---
Just as a bit if a continuation:
---
A min-max guild will run like 2-3 rogues. If all 3 were daggers I'd be surprised. 
---
That said, an average guild can run probably 5~ rogues without any problem, and I'd say 2-3 of them will be daggers at most. That said though, those are the only 3 people out of 40 you'll be competing with for a weapon for priority. Hunters want Core Hound Tooth, but shouldn't get prio over a rogue. A warrior may want to go daggers for some sort of meme, but again, shouldnt get prio on daggers over a rogue. 
---
So like yea, the hardest part of dagger spec is getting a Felstriker really. After that, compared to everyone else, you probably have the easiest time getting your weapons. 
---
All dps casters fight over the same weapons pretty much. All melee dps that use swords want the same swords pretty much. 
---
Thinking about it, in terms of dps players and classes weapon prio, the only class that might have an easier time getting weapons is a hunter, and even then it's only for bows, typically they have a hard time getting their bis melee weapons for pve because rogues/dps warriors want them. But on the flip side, a rogue needs 2 melee weapons vs a hunter who just needs a bow. So yea, hunters probably easier but close behind id say is a dagger rogue. 
---
So like yea, if you're happy to play daggers play a rogue man!
---
The arm of lazy boys are actually extremely good and accurate mousepads. I understand your skepticism believe me, but in 15 years I haven’t had an issue, aside from the last lazy boy breaking.
---
I mean, some percentage of people are going to burn out, realizing they dont have time to play much, others will try it with their friends but not get what the big deal is and go back to their console games, etc... but the rush is going to be just nuts. My friends are all varying levels of experience with wow but only 1-2 of them play currently and will be jumping on classic, and about 25 of us that used to play are coming back for it. I think the influx of old players coming back to check it out is going to be just insanely huge.
---
You'll be PvE- go troll papa.
---
Why is that "painfully obvious?" Why wouldn't it make more sense to keep retail the way it is for the millions of people that like it, and just sell more content for classic for the tens (maybe a hundred) of thousands of people that like it? As a game developer it seems like the smart move to me two just keep the two different games that cater to two different types of players separate. But please, tell me why it makes a lot more sense to try to combine two fanbases that hate eachothers' games into one.

Truth. Auction House should be universal but also taxed so it's always cheaper to sell your goods "locally".
---
I don't think it's possible to be "hit capped" as a Rogue.
---
Well okay. Should blizzard then aim to have massive queues, vanilla level server cap or do you just want 10k+ online at the same time then?
---
Im currently doing Dun Morogh.

There is no mention of the quest "Beer Basted Boar Ribs". Is this on purpose?

So if you're in a zone with 100 other people, how many meaningful connections are you likely to make?

Now what if you're in a zone with 600 other people, how many meaningful connections are you likely to make?

Be honest.
---
This reminds me of Silkroad Online.
---
Minimum specs are there for a reason.  Not to sound cruel, but devs don't make a work around for people operating below those levels. 
---
Might be time to bite the bullet and upgrade to a new laptop for a few hundred. 
---
Or deal with the lag.
---
Currency as a hedge against RNG loot is good game design. Just, full out. It's unfortunate that some feel pressured or w/e by it though.
---
Thats where my struggle is too. I think troll would overall be better (In terms of racial, mount, starting zone, etc.) But, I prefer the look and casting animations of undead.
---
I thought the same when Blizzard announced no separate EU language realms. It was clear they doubted Classic potential to attract and hold players. (Fortunately they changed their minds later.)
---
The only things that will be fixed/changed are any additional non-vanilla bugs that are found.

There's about half of a Rogue chain and faction you can rep up in that just ends abruptly, related to Ravenholdt.
---
There are no rewards or anything for the rep... they just talk to you nicer and you can get exalted.
---
The only quest with a half-decent reward sends you to Sunken Temple. It's only one of two quests that gives a reward at all.
---
Yeah, I'd say they wanted to do more with it lol
---
This thread has a lot of salt and qegho is one of the reasons why.
---
One retail player is worth more than one classic player.
---
The one thing that struck me immediately about retail is that leveling literally feels like a chore to get to the content, instead of content itself, which makes boosts look more attractive. I don't doubt for a minute Blizz' whole strategy is to get more subs into the game they can get the most money out of.
---
Matt Damon
---
Yeah, I've been watching Bean duel and things people claim to be bugged doesnt seem to be. One example that I read alot on this forum is that you can't feign into trap because of a combat bug. 
---
I watch Bean do that frequently in his duels, the only time it fails is if someone resists the trap.
---
I did notice the pet not looking 100% responsive after a fear, and a few other times. Other than that, Hunter seems fine right now...
---
Parry chance is a good deal higher in classic compared to pservers, which means dual wielding will make bosses get parry haste way more often and thus do even more damage to a tank who already doesn't have a shield.
---
Aquaman doesn't have Windfury.
---
Resto Shamans are better than some dude in spandex summoning whales and fish n crap.
---
Auto-shot will be the majority of your damage on single target encounters. It is very important not to clip your AS with anything, even as tempting as it might be to throw in that multi-shot.
---
you cannot really make a group as a dps.

A group of 3 dps aren't lfm, they're lfg.

Well obviously. It was printed 15 years ago.

Thanks for all your answers guys. I think I'll go orc
---
I actually enjoyed the token farming in WoTLK... I met a lot of people from spamming heroic dungeons as a healer all day every day.
---
The argument for Troll is that Shadowguard scales very well with +damage and allows for three Blackout procs per cast, whereas DP is on a long cooldown and can be cleansed by several classes.
---
Frankly, I personally think it's not nearly as lopsided as some claim. There are clear advantages for Troll SPriest in PvP, but DP is *extremely* powerful for both damage throughput and survivability in many 1v1 circumstances, SPriests aren't great in group PvP anyway due to dedicated clerics, and WotF is one of the best racials in the game.
---
In the end, choose the one you like to look at more. That's a lot more important in the long run than theorycraft minmaxing of racials.
---
What server and guild was this?
---
Name one
---
No, but I anticipate a disagreement over pvp or not. I despise random world ganking pvp so much, i'm considering not playing with my longtime guild if they decide on pvp. Reallyfeelsbadman.
---
That's nice to hear :)
---
What you are failing to understand is that something that is profitable from a business perspective is not a 'failing piece of garbage' so of course they are going to support it. 
---
A small part of their community complaining about the game being 'trash' because it's being moulded to make Blizzard money and not suit the individual's needs is a waste of everyone's time.
---
If you can make a name for yourself for being honest &amp; fair, then I can't see why not. It has to be a purely random system. 
---
But then again, why not just do a /roll bet? It's kind of full-proof and there's no argument of fairness.
---
Troll is the better option if you care about min maxing. Also shadowguard blackout procs are way better than stuff you get as understand.
---
Came here to say this. I guarantee that this hype wont last. Some people are definitely overestimating how successful Classic will be. I don't say it will be failure nor it will be bad game. And of course many will enjoy it greatly and people will play it for long time. But it won't be "success that shakes the world" like it used to be. Sure I bet that in launch and couple months in numbers will be huge. But after some time dust will settle down and majority of people will leave.
---
And once again I say I don't hate Classic. I am really hyped and looking forward and I am sure it will be a lot of fun. But it won't be huge thing.
---
Customer comes first, That's where you're going wrong here.
---
10000% agree. When the news of classic wow coming out hit the internet it was the first thing i thought. Could really turn the game into something close to a perfecr mmorpg.
---
I never said it was a failing piece of garbage from a business perspective. I was extremely clear with my First Comment.
---
I don't understand how people, even the Blizzard devs apparently, think all these people are just going to log on and hate the previous systems in the game and think that modern wow is better. If all these people exist, where are they right now?? Where have they been for 7+ years?? Retail has a mere fraction of the subs that WoW maintained for years and years, expansion after expansion.
---
So dont join a reserved run if you dont want to, its clearly stayed from the start whats what.
---
I never join those groups but some do, stop sperging.
---
Well, since the chest will be in phase 2 (patch 1.4) and the layering on beta IS NOT even a slightly good reference. Since they tested it there, nothing with layering on the beta was final and it was manually fiddled with.
---
When there were a total of 50 online on the beta, you still had layers. Which is supposed to trigger after like 3k+ player are online. 
---
It won't make much of a difference, you almost won't notice it and it's just there for the start. Like chill man.
---
No, Reddit is on the internet for tools ;)
---
rather sit at my desk if I'm honest, using a mouse on a chair arm would trigger the fuck out of me.
---
Lol I know man. I understand the perception that it could be not exactly performance enhancing but it’s surprisingly chill.  I hope more people try it out or come out as arm chair heroes. We exist. And we are comfortable!
---
I really appreciate all the responses, thanks y'all for the help! :)
---
Its not about the mana cost, you can have just one sting on a target, and you have better stings like speed reduction, mana burn and dot so scorpid isnt used
---
Reality check, people "dislike" vanilla even if they haven't played it because it's such a simple and stupid game. When they finally realize it's actually an RPG and not some kind of button smashing action game they'll love it just like us!

[Wowpedia's entry on the clownsuit](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Clownsuit)

Do you mean there should be a way to explicitly state that, or are you looking ways to form IRL relationships with new guild members?

Been playing private servers for years and didn't know this stuff because I haven't played retail at all. Thanks
---
You apply it if you want to trap something you already have another sting on. Viper and Serpent both break Freezing Trap. Scorpid doesn’t.
---
I feel I need to be very clear on reddit sometimes lol.
---
It's not that bad especially with a awesome chair or recliner (chill lol)

my Dad once made a chair like yours with speakers and flip out mouse and keyboard.

It’s not bad at all, really. I couldn’t imagine sitting at an actual desk for hours on end playing. But I’ve been rockin like this for 15 years.
---
Wonderful insights, thanks for sharing.
---
You made a statement, followed by saying Blizzard may be intentionally doing it. That would mean it's from Blizzard's perspective.
---
Most of the people watching asmongold are between 24-34 years old. 
---
Different games for different people my friend :) Wow classic will get at least 1 million subs. For a 30 year old, a few euro wont matter. The slower pace is also perfect for those "older" gamers. They will be subbed even if they're only able to play 25% of what they used to.
---
Orc imo
---
Sure as long as its automated, no way I'm standing there all day
---
I agree that this is a big issue and it seems like a common problem but I'm not sure how to solve this on a website, can you?  Maybe some sort of \*gasp\* LFR type search to help fill the last couple spots of a raid that random 60s could fill?  I don't think the no changes group would like that very much, haha.
---
For general mob killing, if the target is going to live for the duration of the dot, then it's probably efficient to apply it.  
---
Maybe most efficient right when you first learn the next level of it.

The Honor System is in the Beta, but the maximum rank a level 40 can achieve is rank 5.

Well, all DKP systems have some flaws. You could give main spec-prio over off-spec bids, but in the case of druids you need to figure out what role they will play in your raids. They can effectively play 2 out of 3 roles in a single spec if you ask me (tank/dps, tank/heal or heal/dps), so they would have 2 main and 1 offspec for example.
---
Our very first computer we had a huge 39 inch heavy hd tv that was about 3 foot wide, we spent almost 2 grand on it and it was only 800x600 res.

Only had a rocking chair and a mouse with a thumb ball. I played hours and hours of diablo 2 on it if you can imagine.  I’ve sort of been doing this since I’ve owned a computer, the only difference is that it got more comfortable.

I am this way because of my dad, is my point.

Old quote, but he meant it. I respect him, mostly, but he is pretty good at failing to see different opinions.  It's always been that way. Even before he joined Blizz
---
I think your right. Some will think it's too difficult and quit. Until you get a want, priests are really terrible. Your one DPS ability sucks and hitting things with a mace is terrible damage.
---
Oo, that's a new one!  Great insight Ohyuckie, thank you.  I think having a bunch of options for players select for hobbies that they do ingame would be a great feature!
---
Thought this would be a bad quest helper. Was pleasantly surprised. Nice work OP. Would recommend changing the font color though.
---
Does anyone have any hard data on the actual damage to compare it with others?  What about the crowd pummeler?
---
Do you keep access after you de-rank?

It's pretty useless because you can just download an addon which shows you where every chest spawn is on the map.

---
I’m worried about what server to pick; I’m scared that it will die out after a couple months and then will have to change from a dead server; bringing back memories of swtor; god I loved that game but before it went ftp there where only 2 teams doing ranked pvp; we can only que when we where both on; and we where the only ones raiding too. If they open up too much servers at start it could snowball to people quiting because they won’t want to transfer or level another toon on another server. Hope they have free transfers after like 4 months for a bit.
---
Doesn’t matter. Do you think blizzard execs and probably even the devs and other employees aren’t secretly hoping classic underperforms so they can finally shut us up?
---
Auto Shot is your basic attack, like autoattack for melee. It requires for you to stand still for the last 0.5 seconds of the atack (so if your bow has 2.0 speed, you can move for 1.5 seconds and then have to stand still for 0.5seconds)  so that you actually fire your shot/arrow/bolt.
---
The ability "Aimed shot" is actually a cast, so it interrupts your entire auto shot; It basically resets to 0, so you only want to use it right after an auto shot. That's what people mostly refer to.
---
It's impossible to make true "side grades" that are different in any way. 
---
No one has ever been able to balance any game consistently in the entire history of gaming.
---
You can't change it. The whole appeal of this is that it's a fixed, static, and permanent snapshot of the game.
---
Every gaming community is claimed to be toxic :[
---
Didn't they say phase 1 would last longer than four months? I'm guessing six months until phase 2 hits live.

Thanks for reminding me of the feeling of my first mount, that was fun to be reminded of. I think it was around lvl 44 I had enough money for it (I was shit to save up the money) but once obtained it felt AWESOME.
---
There is a very simple answer. If you don't like reservation runs, don't join.
---
Sorry yes, i was thinking on warlocks curses too as those work same way as stings, on per warlock
---
&gt;Healers? Yes, you actually CAN run out of mana. 
---
I loved it when tanks had enough damage mitigation and health to let me stop healing long enough reregen mana after 5 secs. Heal them to full, put a HOT &amp; shield on, and maybe bandage tank immediately after boss hits them, if it's a slow swinging boss. Then you've got enough health buffer to get some mana regen in.
---
Mana potions are worth it, to have just in case.  
---
If you've got one you can decide between using the potion and wiping. Potions are cheap compared to wiping.
---
Healbot was around in Vanilla and is still the most popular healing addon in BFA.  I'd be very surprised if it didn't get a Classic port.  
---
Even if not, Vuhdo is really popular, works very similarly, and is already updated for Classic.
---
&lt;insert streamer hate&gt;
---
I remember running the Ony Remake 25 man as a DK tank specced Frost Dual wield, then running into an Unholy and a Blood tank later on in the day when just doing a few dungeons on an alt.
---
Wotlk DK was weird, man. I do appreciate all the cool class stuff like Runeforging, but they really shouldn't have made em OP as hell.
---
So they waste resources and production time to purposefully and/or hopefully make a failed product?
---
&gt; I have indeed seen this before, and don't understand why people think it's any better than layering. Because they get to look inside the box? 
---
There are multiple unanswered questions with layering. Is it suppose to solve the issue of overcrowded areas,  which is [not what it initially was suppose to do](https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY?t=116)? Would it be possible to randomly get transfered to a layer? Can scenarios such as; I'm in an empty overcrowded cave, I get transfered, now there's enemies around me happen? What is the total cap (and will they then initate queues) of a server with layering at launch? What happens when the server is still overpopulated by phase 1? Can you forcefully swap layers (group invite etc); effectively dodge pvp, stack nodes, etc?  What happens when a new layer gets opened?
---
Layer 1: 3000 Players  
---
Layer 2: 200 Players?
---
Would give layer 2 people an advantage wouldnt it? but you just cant pull 1400 Layer1 players out of their layer right? What if the playerbase of layer 1 keeps decreasing, will I stay on an empty layer indefinitely?
---
&gt;"Oh, you couldn't create at the same time as me and now I have to reroll and throw away all the time I've spent, or we just can't play together until the merge."
---
It sounds like you are confused as to how this idea would work. The list of subserver would be present to all players. You would choose which subserver you would play on, you would tell your friend/guild "we're playing on Silvermoon 2", and you would allways stay on the same realm. So I'm not sure how you see this scenario could happen. When two layers merge, layer 3-4 (which is now 2) would still have your character there.
---
&gt;	Leading most raids are stupid easy.
---
I take it you are planning to host regular 40-man pugs? I usually do so but I guess I am too narcissistic to do that now.
---
* I have mixed feelings about both questions. In one hand I wanna true vanilla experience but on the other, I have vacations set up at work to be able to play the first 2 weeks as much as I want to. And so, without layering and with current hype for classic, I doubt many players will get out of starting zone in the first day ... I understand point of view from both sides and so I stand neutral in this case. There would be a lot of frustration on the launch day, mainly for people who will roll caster classes which will have hard time tagging any mobs. But then again, we might see random groups form to help each others and that would be the key aspect to what made Vanilla that good, meeting new people and establishing friendships on a long journey that not only leveling will be, but a Classic as a whole.
---
* I think that layering should be ON. Either for first few leveling zones where is no way of reasonable world PVP (and even then only for first few days) or have it world wide, again , just for a few days.
---
* I do not think there are any alternatives to this exact problem. It is either going to be super-duper crowded at the launch day or we will have layering.
---
I am still little bit on the side of not having layering #nochanges, but it may work in majority's favor if implemented and handled correctly.
---
That video is amazing, thank you for that, almost made me spit out my drink
---
Shaman
---
Completely disagree. You can fix things and smooth out gameplay without stripping it of any of its challenge, or problem solving. What they’ve done now is completely different, but to say that they can’t implement small changes to improve Vanilla without destroying what made it great is completely false.
---
That's true
---
I'd try to heal through it. But I'm going OOM and that tank is dying.
---
Legolasz has joined the group
---
Correct. As you get more AP, crit gets more important
---
As you get more crit and hit, AP gets more important
---
No, just Gnomes. Regardless of which faction I'm on.
---
Feelbad indeed. Working on it ;)
---
Because racing to 60 and being concerned about falling behind in the crowd is such a Vanilla thing..
---
Generally weapons are bigger upgrades. Assuming equal skill and gear levels, swords put daggers to shame.
---
Not a huge fan of asmongold but his chat is fucking hillarious. 🤣
---
Never had an issue!
---
Power infusion is so pog
---
Seems like a very minor upgrade to piss off all the warriors and rogues in your groups.
---
Suprising a f. Still looks comfy as hell.
---
You will most likely be tanking dungeons. Or atleast I would. Much faster to find a group. But if you did you wouldn't need mcp or even powershifting for that matter
---
can't have a problem if sucking is your default
---
I said it was easy to get not easier, as in aq20 (once its out obviously duh) is not a hard difficult place, especially the boss that drops the helm.
---
I had the southwind helm on a BiS list i gotten so thats why i asked, but cheers for condescending answer m8, have a good one.
---
But adding changes to vanilla makes it stop being vanilla.
---

---
For pve tailoring is BiS until around phase 4, due to bloodvine set / set bonus. 
---
I'll be tailoring/alch until AQ40 gear comes in for me, then go to engi/alch.
---
I plan to be able to farm necessary herbs for alch via aoe grinding / buying whatever I can't get from aoe grinding. 
---
Pots are fuckin legendary
---
You're not a real person, you don't exist. Impossibru!! :)
---
I was thinking the same thing. The ap loss seems like it might be worth not having to farm them and making some people very angry.
---
Warlock confirmed.
---
You could go play old school RuneScape, otherwise just buy any modern laptop and you can run classic lol.
---
Tbh, the only major thing I heard "doomsayers" as you call them say, is that people will get hyped then realize classic is shitty or boring and leave making classic waste of Blizzard's resources, but considering how populated private servers are I don't see that happening.
---
just wait and see.  
---
  
---
don't feed the trolls just ignore them.
---
You're quoting a 3 year old article.. a bit disingengous.
---
Why wouldn't SoC be worth it? It's the best dmg seal, even in a reckoning build, the one SoC proc you get usually outdamages all of the SoR procs combined. The only time SoC isn't worth it, is if you are completely spelldmg focused, but that's more of a pve build called spelladin.
---
Redoubt is mostly a gateway talent. Unfortunately both Tier 1 prot talents are pretty crappy, but imp devo aura is worth ~180 armor and thus completely worthless. Redoubt provides at least some mitigation, if you switch to sword and board, which may be good vs rogues, warriors or hunters at times. The true allure of prot is Tier 2 with precision and most importantly guardians favor.
---
Regarding your build, got to say, I'm not a fan:
---
* As I said, holy shock is not that good, it has 43% scaling and only deals 380 base dmg. So even with 500 spelldmg, it provides you with just a 600 dmg, which crits for 900, burst dmg every 30 seconds. Every single SoC proc you get with a deep ret build will easily match that. Compare that to shamans shocks, earth shock costs 125 mana more, but already deals 530 dmg at 0 spelldmg and only has 6sec cd. The healing versatility, also isn't that useful, as a FoL helas about the same, the only advantage of holy shock here is to avoid the casting time.
---
* You are missing Guardians Favor. In my opinion, this is the most important pvp talent and every single pvp focused build should have it. It increases the uptime of blessing of freedom from 50% to 80%. This is not only great for you to keep up to classes, who wish to kite you, but is also massive in group pvp, where you support others.
---
* You are missing healing light. You go 32 points into holy and don't pick it, even if your build is focused on offense, the extra healing is great and certainly better than imp lay on hands or full 5/5 divine strength or it
---
* I don't really see where you are going with ret. You are missing pretty much every keystone talent and pick weird stuff, which doesn't help a lot. 
---
  * Imp seal of the crusader is pretty useless in pvp, the jdugement bonus dmg simply takes too long to be worth it and you cannot guarantee a lasting judgement on an opponent. Even if you can, you are most of the times better off judging light or wisdom to sustain yourself than to get a little dmg bonus. But mostly, you'd just judge command or rightousness for the direct damage.
---
  * Vindication is not good. It's -15% str and agi. Against a high end warrior, that's something like 90 AP and 2% crit chance. But the real kicker here is, that vidication helps against classes, which are pretty good matchups for you anyway and does nothing against classes, who you have trouble with.
---
  * imp ret aura isn't bad, but also mostly good against rogues, though as you are missing sanctity, it's the best aura you can get.
---
  * I don't see what you get out of ret besides judgement cd, movement speed and eye for an eye.
---
* So, overall, this looks like a holy build, which has trouble healing, can't support that well and lacks burstdmg. I don't think, this build will make you effective or happy. 
---
If you want to hold on to a holy shock build, I'd go for something like this: 
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=44503102501051050200000000000052030210000000
---
This gives you some burst potential and improves your support abilities. Overall I'm not too big of a fan, this makes a good pvp healer, who can pack a punch with lucky SoC crits. I feel, tihs build is versatile, but lacking in both departments. By going for spelldmg, your +heal is lower than a pure healing paladin and your crit chance is fairly low to deliver big burst spikes. But maybe the holy shock can make up for that.
---
My question is where the hell am I gonna be able to buy it? None of Tools shit is available on any service for sale, and I have no idea where the hell I can buy a CD anymore
---
You should go undead then! You will be looking at that character and seeing its casting animations for as long as you play it. I recently played an undead priest on a pserver and realized I *don't* like the casting animations of undead nor how gear looks on them so I'm going Troll because I do like said things on Trolls. Certainly not objective just my subjective preference. So if you prefer undead asthetic and animations honestly you should roll Undead! I'd rather miss the racials I hypothetically wanted than have a character that I don't love to look at.
---
Only source I've seen for that has been a 4chan leak.
---
So yeah.. I wouldn't trust that. There is no source for sub numbers since Blizz stopped being public with them back in whenever. So we can guess they're probably not that great (i.e less than in their glory days) but good enough, combined with microtransactions to keep the game running.
---
same here. Still intersted in "re-living" vanilla (I started just when TBC came out).
---
"just pull and let god sort it out" lol i would have loved a raid leader like this .
---
Based on raid priority, you'll have plenty of time to roll on these with guildies that have better. Assuming you don't just run with other classes.
---
That said I'm not going to go out of my way for them unless I suddenly find a lot more free time in phase 1. (Or one of them drops for me real early, but that's neither here nor there)
---
If you just did it...naw. i was chasin Chilly around IF and SW for a few hours a few days ago.
---
Actually it's the tanks that ignore your mana% on pulls.
---
Tinfoil hat, on.
---
Because "toxic" is a meaningless buzzword at this point. Anyone who itn't a 100% Yesman can be called toxic by someone.
---
This post reads like you have hit right click and ‘suggest synonyms’ on most of the words in it
---
Classic will be constant gratification.
---
where are you gonna set down your snacks tho
---
it would really surprise me if classic can get a million ongoing players
---
Yes it works just fine. Things ding when they should.
---
The earlier in every phase is when you need it the most you don't have good +healing to make downranking super efficient and tanks/dps takes more damage the trick is to find the rank you can spam for 75-80% of the fight while using consumables. (75-80% because of aborted heals from pre casting)
---
Leading teams is hard. You can either be chilled and let people play how they want, or you can get shit done by calling out mistakes and ensuring we don’t repeat them over and over.. 
---
Heck the only team i’ve lead in years was an OW team with 6 people and I have similar issues. When you call group up and see 3 people ignoring and keep running in - you either call them out individually or don’t say anything. You have to come off as a bit of a dick otherwise the coordination just isn’t there. 
---
This is also what creates the casual / hardcore divide. If you let simple mistakes happen over and over along with various playing vastly underperforming - your a casual guild. The Hardcore ones will be making sure it doesn’t happen again and won’t be afraid to cut out underperformers.
---
My experience is with 6 people. 40 would actually have me pulling hairs if we had any intention of efficiency.
---
Look up Akrios Eviscerate on YouTube. His first couple are vanilla iirc. He stopped playing in wrath.  
---
World PvP with 1vX scenarios
---
Someone may have already posted this before, but I don't think I'd seen it on this sub until I came across it in the book last night. This was around the time that the world was coming together - zones were built, textured, filled with doodads and enemies and being stitched together. John talks about how they wanted 30 dungeons at launch (which of course didn't end up happening), and above you can see some of the ideas they had at the time. Of course, some made it into the game at a later date and some have never been seen. You can also see some of the older names for dungeons (i.e. World Tree, not Teldrassil) and The Monastery (Scarlet). 
---
This book is an *absolute must read* for people remotely interested in WoW's history, especially people on this sub. Yeah, it's a little pricey for a book (about 50 bucks on Amazon I think), but the thing is beautiful, well made, well written, and absolutely fascinating. Insights on WoW's development that had never been seen or heard before.
---
Yeah they started giving EVERY class a version of blink or charge, or movement speed increase, then every class got defensive cooldowns etc etc
---
Always with the whiny healers. 
---
'OOM! Still drinking! Don't use Blood Fury! Don't run LoS! Why is the tank not wearing a shield?!?! OOM!'
---
Complaints aren't really a way to indicate a game is bad. People always complain, there were definitely tons of complaints during classic. When you browsed the official forums most posts were bitching about something.
---
Thats just not true. Drinking an armor potion will give you 2000 armor for 2 mins which is as much as a shield. You will need to put a shield on for certain parts of a boss fight but in general with decent healers youll be just fine. Your healers will be able to spam max rank healing because your dps will be able to go 100% and kill the boss within 60 seconds instead of 240 seconds
---
Nope it's you ;)
---
Hm maybe that's it, when I healed it was literally just farm content and i was wearing a billion healing power since mana wasn't an issue with level of potting ;)
---
Yeah but have you PLAYED Starcraft?
---
OSRS treatment...AFTER naxx

Wingclip hunter is a meme started by a private server guild 😂

I much prefer an ergonomic setup. No way this is comfortable or healthy in the long run.

Both BRD and BRS are awesome dungeons, but the old sunken temple and stratholme are also really cool.

Painting everyone with the same brush is a dangerous way to live life. I didn’t give af when they announced sharding the starting zones.

---
Orc stun resist too strong. 
---
Will of the forsaken doesn’t compare to the amount of times Orc stun resist can save you.
---
BUT, play undead if you think they’re cool. Play Orc if you think they’re cool. At the end of the day, its all about if you’re enjoying your character
---
Makes sense.
---
Hardiness (25% stun resist) is the single most overpowered PVP racial in the game. There are too many stun effects to even count them all, and an Orc will resist 6 times more of them than any other race.
---
Both of them have no benefits for PVE. How ever Orc counters your worst enemy. Stuns
---
I noticed this aswell. Grouped up with a couple people to help each other with some quests.
---
can't wait to compete with the chinese in deadwind pass for the mageview cloth!
---
If only I knew before... Thanks anyway!
---
So in other words, you accept the stuff that supports your argument (even though that stuff is shitty too), but dismiss everything else as "weird" so that you can maintain your beliefs despite what your eyeballs are showing you.  Sounds about right.  People are more likely to disbelieve their own senses than change their beliefs.  You can take a flat earther into space and fly them around the globe and they would just say that it was a visual illusion or something, or maybe just "weird".  Nothing more I can do.  I showed you layering wasn't static, video proof, and you won't accept it.
---
I did not do a lot of raiding due to time restricitons but I sometimes got invited to a friends raid as a healer if they had trouble getting enough people together. I did pretty well and most raid members happy when I came along. I was a feral druid.

URO  love upright orcs and I rolled my new lock that way
---
You keep using this word "griefing" and I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
Jokes aside, There is very little that 1 faction can do to the Other faction that is considered griefing. Griefing is when you try to kill a teammate in a coop game or something. If your on a pvp server its all "pvp" not "griefing"
---
To try to help out let me give you an example of actual griefing:
---
Some alliance guys don't like a chap in their guild. So they get together with a horde rogue on the server. They pay the horde rogue 50g to sneak near their raid before guild time, and use gnomish mind control cap on this chap they they don't like. They then proceed to, while their chap is mind-controlled and hostile to alliance, kill him.
---
\^This is griefing. Pvp is not griefing. This is a faction vs faction pvp game
---
Thanks :) I was totally unaware that was there
---
Classic should have its own tab since it is a different game from retail
---
Written in  04/26/2016. Comment made by one retail fanboy.
---
Atm im thinking Blizzard is actually counting that Classic will fucking SAVE them.
---
/thread is a way of saying "nothing more needs to be said".
---
I so agree with you, classic wow has me more excited for a game launch since the days of Bc and Halo 3 launches when I was a kid and I'm 28. It's got me planning, scheming etc like when I was a kid.
---
Me and a few of the boys have decided to go hard and took weeks off from work to play 20 hours a day and go for world first.  
---
I am putting together what I hope to be the best US guild, based upon DKP like the days of old.
---
I'm about to release and Android app tonight featuring a countdown timer to classic and a widget.  I am also working on the discord bot, if you'd anyone would like to get involved message me or add me on discord: Phantom Of The AWPera #5754.
---
I will be making a formal post and such in the next few days.
---
I like both, and the comments on the stun resist is starting to sway me more toward Orc atm.
---
I started around there too. It should be an  entirely new experience for us (sort of)
---
provided only upon agreement of the TOS when you play the game. which basically states you are only granted access, you do not own anything.
---
RotAM is a pattern that is in a dungeon that will be in classic release and was in 1.12
---
Things like Lionheart Helm (warr bis helm, BS craft) won't be available on release 
---
Same with bloodvine obviously , that's p2
---
Oh, I did not know that, thank you.
---
I did! That was actually the first prototype, went on to sell a bunch for this sub. Finally started to slow down enough to make some other things!
---
&gt; Even basic shit like tanking and healing mechanics need to go. Turn based GCD auto attacking garbage needs to go.
---
Hahaha, no, this is where you're extremely wrong. These things make it a calm RPG of a certain class that combines well with other aspects of the game. You're effectively asking to change the genre like it doesn't matter.
---
Twitchier is not better. Destiny exists, but it's a different game. No twitchy combat game will ever replace something like Vanilla WoW.
---
lol after watching the video "Hey guys lets hold the tournament in STV no one ever pvps there"
---
Only the added damage from AP is normalized. The weapon's average damage per attack still matters, and if you compare 2 weapons of similar item level the slower one is going to have higher damage.
---
Fucking oath, lets go rip a fat mix mate. That sign is like a bat-signal for stoner aussies.
---
He already explained in his post, if they're normalized they're normalized up to a certain speed. Going below that isn't worth the additional yellow dmg loss. People were already playing with fast offhands for poisons however.
---
Broken on second week of Beta alongside trade chat.
---
Yeah they just don't get it.  It's almost 100% retail players that support layering.  The more you talk to them, the more you realize many of them literally do not care about things like immersion, world cohesion, and organic social interaction.  Kind of hard to convince someone layering is bad when they are fine playing a whole different game than you want and don't seem to give a shit about vanilla's integrity.
---
I think that is true on many lines (even though some parts of WotLK were better than TBC). 
---
\- First raid was Naxx. It did not fit in many ways. Most important: It killed the legend and it killed the timeline (just like KT did in TBC). Naxx was dead. They just revived it even with the same bosses. That was stupid. 
---
\- Long time no content after the much to easy Naxx
---
\- 10 + 25 man in the same dungeon. And with different loot (and Heroic mode made it even worse). Item level went up muhc to fast with lots of negative effects we see still today 
---
\- Worst profession (inscription) ever added. It was one time use. It shortly peaked then fell into abyss. Compared to JC, Enchanting or even alchemy it was incredibly bad
---
\- 51 + 41 talents were mandatory because to good so there was nearly no freedom in talents any more (think of 0/30/21 WL in classic). This was already a problem in TBC
---
\- Flying broke emersion. Servers did not show other players fast enough. You could not see or combat in air
---
\- Verhicles forced you out of character
---
\- Achievements
---
\- OP Hero class
---
\- Start of the reactionary playstyle (oh, fingers of frost, now I have to use an Icelance.... as if that is any more engaging than just Frostbolt)
---
But:
---
\- Story was nice
---
\- Achievement worked ok as it was not that many
---
Dailys, time gated so I don't like the concept, at least were done well over all
---
\- Cinematics (Gate!) were really nice
---
Yes you need an active sub in order for it to show up. 
---
It does work for Europe, atleast for me.
---
Oh I had no idea I was reposting, I thought I never saw here posts regarding toxicity, sorry for that. And well current wow vs classic wow is war that will never end.
---
I played Halflife1 to completion at around 0.5 to 2 FPS.
---
You are being cool af. Thats what are you doing with your hands sir.
---
just roll pve server please, and stop bothering us.
---
Orcs are not up upright in classic, at least not the males. Also what is "URO"?
---
One or two complaints yeah, sure. But didn't you see all those threads and youtube videos where people were offering (constructive) criticism, ideas on how to fix the azerite system and etc? They got hundreds of thousands of views and were not down-voted. People were complaining about very core changes to the game e.g GCD changes. Who liked that? It ruined pvp and made the game slow. There's lots of big issues people have been having. It's not just 5 people saying X class is OP. Or ranting about something because they were bad.
---
Gotcha, thanks and you too /u/fiftyseven
---
&gt; The fundamental Everquest style MMO gameplay loop has been completely played out. It's dull. People are over it.
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
🤙😐🤙
---
was it any good?
---
&gt; Idk what people expect though since changing classic could potentially ruin the game so of course the community is adamantly against it.
---
I'd say a lot of the missing elements (quests, viable specs etc) and broken parts that existed in the game at the time do a good job of ruining the game already.
---
The armor isn't why a shield helps. It's the fact that a block cannot be a crushing blow, so having enough block pushes crushing blows off the hit table.
---
To become uncrushable, you need a high block, parry, dodge and/or defense. The only way to do that in Classic is with a shield AND using the Shield Block ability. Passive uncrushable was only attainable in BC and still required a shield (or Bear Form).
---
I am pretty sure that with crushing blows, and parry haste, DW tanking will be so rare that it's nearly nonexistent. Skarm will probably do it, because he's obsessed with it, but his healers will hate him.
---
&gt;The mindset of an individual who decides to start a run to eliminate competition does so because they aren't very good at making friends
---
You sound like you're the best at making friends.
---

I'm sure every raid leader has had one of those "fuck it" moments.
---
When you use distracting shot to peel a mob off the healer and he spends the next three months professing his unrequited love for you in trade chat
---
Well orc is obv very strong. 
---
But undead locks straight up win the lock vs lock match up. Also big edge vs shadow priests.
---
So is it worth having a good advantage in overall pvp or straight up winning two matchups. Also undead helps vs Warr fear.
---
I’d go with what you think looks cool tbh.
---
You can play a priest in few completely different ways and it varies between alliance and horde too. You can go the SPAM route with flash heal spam. Or more mana conservative, heal/gh ranks + renew.
---
Tbh, you should only use \~2 different ranks per spell, thats enough. I would have MAX rank + the mana conservative option. Because of alliance, you got the spam route covered by paladins, so i would do more heal/gheal+renew route.
---
And once you get 8/8 T2, you are gonna get such powerspike that its fucking nuts. After that GH rank 1 is your best friend well into naxx and even in some naxx fights thats just superior.
---
Since you are now doing slower heals+renew (just one priest handle renew so you conserve mana, i would only use max rank on MT, others, like warlocks can get something like R5, but usually warlock taps get sniped by paladins anyways, so usually not worth it), the main thing is for you to KNOW the bossfights. You can keep precasting, but more importantly when the BIG hit of a boss comes (and it either shown as boss animation or DMB timer), you need to land a BIG heal 0.1-0.3s after that. Paladin spam on tank is fine, but you need a LOT of them coming to get a tank back to reasonable health. 
---
Even SHIELDING before a big hit is advised on certain situations when boss does nearly the tanks health size attack at once. It doesnt show in meters, but you can be sure it can save a whipe sometimes.
---
Swords, in general, from what I've experienced on pservers at least, are better than dagger rogues, even without human racial.
---
Millions of people are probably addicts I would say. Meth is meth even if it's bad meth right?
---
Common nooby mistake #1: Thinking all specs are viable like they are on retail. A lot of specs are pure junk because the classes they were attached to were launched incomplete and pared back from original plans.
---
Shit, that's reads like a markov chain generated from my vanilla chat logs!
---
played during cata with a laptop and a mouse on the arm of a lazy boy. This is true
---
The APES are streamers too.
---
who says I am going to announce my intentions?  
---
people pass you lead as the tank so you can mark targets.  
---
not to mention that I mostly start the groups so I'm leader anyways.    
---
unless you leave the group once I switched to ML there is no way to avoid it anymore.
---
sorry that you don't seem to like the idea of enforcing a fair environment.
---
&gt; The fundamental Everquest style MMO gameplay loop has been completely played out. 
---
There has been a distinct lack of that type of game in the past couple of years while we got an assload of MMOs that do action combat, i.e. lots of movement, reticle targeted abilities and so on. Skyforge, Neverwinter, GW2, Wildstar, Tera....
---
And for some reason, none of these games (except maybe GW2) had any sort of long-term staying power. People got bored of them fast.
---
There have been barely any EQ/WoW-style MMORPGs in like a decade, so maybe it's time to bring it back again.
---
It's barely more than a 10% increase to damage taken across the span of the entire bossfight. It won't stop the majority of guilds who know what they are doing.
---
you are crazy.
---
Ahh classic WoW the days where it wasn't unheard of to have guilds planning full on raids....against non capital towns. My favorite was raiding Astrannar in Ashenvale. After Burning Crusade this became less popular eventually nobody bothered raiding anything but the big cities. And this is talking about a non PvP server so was less likely. Was nice when getting a character from 1-60 meant something and you couldn't just breeze your way through a small hand full of zones. 
---
All the changes and making it easier reduced the fun of the game just sit in a big city hit que and zoom off into dungeon on other side of world. Always missed the days of going into town and requesting a brave group of adventurers to just me on a quest to kill this or that boss, and then journeying off together to go face then.
---
Had to actually go out and hunt down out of the way towns in order to complete flight paths for crossing the continent. Burning Crusade was a great expansion but should have had a split from there that went no further after BC the game got to easy since they wanted you to level up to new content quicker.
---
The other thing that should be left alone is the difficulty of some bosses I don't care how hard or near impossible a boss is as long as 2 rules apply. 1) the boss is still capable of being defeated, and 2) No boss that isn't a rare spawn elite is stronger than the Big Boss of the dungeon. Some nerfs to bosses are necessary because one mechanic or another breaks the fight and makes it impossible to defeat. But as long as it can still be done and especially if it's the Big Bad of the entire game at that point. I say let the bastard be so strong he kicks my rear and I'll still come back just to prove I can bring him down.
---
I am leaning towards Orc more now after seeing all the comments on how good the sun resist is, and they look good in T2 gear.
---
You always jump. Even if you are no way going to make it. You still try and jump.
---
Yes, I definetely think they underestimate Classic WoW's success very much. There will definetely be a drop off within the first month, but I expect it will be way less than what Blizzard is expecting.
---
I don't know, I just get the feeling Blizzard wants Classic to fail on a large scale. They hope the hardcore Classic audience will be content and then finally shut up so they can keep pretending that modern WoW is a good game and keep milking it's audience with micro transactions. But they never seem to contemplate the idea that Classic might be very succesful not just with the nostalgic Vanilla fans but with the WoW community in general. If that happens it will be the best evidence showing that Blizzard has turned a masterpiece into a shit show.
---
So, they don't want to advertise Classic. They want a silent launch and not much hype to they can keep focusing on retail. 
---
Layering and the lack of servers we seem to get at launch looks to be a result of Blizzard not wanting Classic WoW to succeed or not believing Classic WoW will succeed.
---
Perfect time to teach him a lesson with PWS.
---
The current grind fest is what turned me off retail WoW.
---
ATM it seems to just be do dungeons to get gear to raid until they add a new raid so you can then go do the same dungeons for "upgrades" to go do the new raid.
---
I am looking forward to more linear progression, as in once you get your character kitted out in gear from raids you only need to grind mats/gold (or keys) and then jump straight in to the next raid.
---
OP is the majority of this reddit. People making post about things they don't even understand.
---
DW tanking will NOT exist in Classic.
---
14% parry on raid bosses = dead DW tanks.
---
Druids will also have it really, REALLY hard, with 14% parry.
---
yeah i think so too. some of it started in TBC i think, with the introduction of flying mounts.
---
flying means you lose all the feeling of constantly being in danger. it also mean physical disengagement from other players. you wont meet any old enemys or old friends up in the air.
---
to me, this was the only but big downside of otherwise the best time i ever had in WoW with the best expasion of them all.
---
Why is it that people that appreciate classic have to bash retail? They are now so far apart that they are 2 different games basically. You might as well bash any other game, but why would you need to in the first place?
---
I know it's what the upvote button is for, but I just wanted to say great post. Articulated my feelings better than I ever could.

you'll get negative comments from the community here, if you propose a change or an what about after naxx suggestion.  
---
Lucky for those people there is now /r/classicwowplus, for all these ideas
---
It's like 10% more damage taken at most. Compared to private servers where boss damage is significantly overtuned it might still result in tanks taking less damage in the real game than they did on the knockoff.
---
And to play private you are simply using the client, you are doing nothing u werent when playing retail. The difference is the code communicating with the client
---
Don't forget who Jeff is. He was speaking from the perspective of a high-end raider, and in general he's right. Taking the Kara example, that raid is lauded because it was casual content for the entire expansion. I'm sure high-end raiders wouldn't speak so highly of it as an activity, despite how pretty and thematic they might find it in a vacuum.
---
Rolling on a pve server so will be doing very little pvp if any to be honest.
---
Completely agree. T7 was horrid and poisoned the atmosphere in the guild with many thinking about quitting and losing motivation. 
---
The watered down levelling, the laughable heroics, running a watered down Naxx twice a week due to their stupid every raid as 10 and 25 man decision; no amount of fun gameplay with classes that felt well and all the style the game oozed made up for that.
---
Having a real hard time choosing between a lanky rasta mon for a tiny bit more threat in pve, or a badass muscular zug zug orc for the huge pvp boost...
---
not quite, there are "mandatory" ones you would need to do BUT the goal posts are not constantly shifting, you get it done then that's you
---
starting the group does. which I'll mostly be doing anyways.  
---
well, people are free to leave if they don't enjoy a fair environment. this automatically weeds out all the asshats. which is fine by me.
---
A dead tanks doesn't do threat.
---
First rule of Vanilla tanking.
---
Prot Warriors.
---
Rest is just insanity, repeating the same shit, expecting different results.
---
Weapons are (in general) the most important piece of gear to upgrade for physical dps
---
Bosses deal a lot more damage on private servers and guilds still managed to dual wield tank just fine.
---
Both don’t really matter too much for PvE so pick what you want. If you really wanted to minmax, the benefit of Orc is increased pet damage but since the typical spec is DS/Ruin it wouldn’t matter. Undead you have cannibalize(less downtime), some shadow resist, and WoTF which can break some boss fears. I’d say undead has the slight edge in PvE but it really doesn’t matter on Horde—play what looks cool.
---
Yeah, I have been mostly nochanges for years not because I need vanilla to be perfect and think the smallest change is unacceptable, but because I knew that with Blizzard and loud players with a different agenda if you give an inch they will take a mile.
---
The people making vanilla are the ones that made retail, and it's pretty obvious they think retail is a superior product, Blizzard's president especially.  I don't hold it against them.  If i worked for years on a project, pouring everything into it, and had a group of people say "it sucks, scrap it back to the beginning please", I'd be in denial at the very least.  They don't seem to value the Vanilla experience they have promised to replicate.  It also doesn't make sense to them that people would rather sit in a queue than have a "feature" remotely similar to what they have in retail, because they think retail is good.
---
Of course, you get into psychological issues where creating a successful vanilla without any changes is almost a conflict of interest for them, because if it's successful, what does that say about their work on retail?  Brack even jokingly mentioned he was worried, but I think there's some truth there.  If I'm on the board of directors, I see that consumers think the game was better before I hired these devs *to make the game better*, maybe I start to think I hired the wrong people, and shouldn't make that mistake again.
---
Thanks.
---
It is. In general, encounter design has only improved. People raved about the two boss fights in Crucible of Storms, and that was all by one guy. Gul'dan in Legion was another standout fight design-wise. In fact, Ion led that team through some of the best encounters they've designed before he got Peter Principle'd from lead encounter designer to game lead after Legion launched.
---
Not the biggest margin though, but if you are trying to min max
---
Yeah. I definitely want there to be a big gap from naxx to new stuff, but eventually the majority of the server will need it. Unless they plan to do fresh server seasons it’s their best bet for continued revenue(either classic+ or tbc servers)
---
Stay above it, man. Retaliation brings nothing and it's only classic players reading these forums anyway..
---
Sadly it didn't actually say I don't think, but like Skogash said I'd guess at difficulty.
---
Bullshit.
---
I mean you'll be last to get it, but at ~20% drop no reason not to get kitted out eventually.
---
"fucking" seems to be his favourite word.
---
Assuming that it's the only difference between pirate WoW and Classic, and that is a heck of an assumption, it's 10% more damage to the tank and 10% less threat on the boss, which means the fight goes 10% longer and the healers are using 10% more mana per minute.
---
That is not an issue if the content is completely on farm and you are speed-clearing it, but if the fight was touch-and-go with pirate server parry mechanics then it's a wipe with Classic mechanics.
---
Guestimate a percentage difference.
---
Lol at the people not even paying attention that you're rolling on PvE. 
---
UD have slightly more base int and wotf has it's uses in raids.
---
Can they realistically release anything else than TBC?, they planned 6 release cycles for classic which probably means they expect classic to have a lifespan similar to vanilla around 2 years. I don't think they are working on a new expansion for classic now, and unless they already are done with design and are ready to start development I don't think it's possible for them to have it ready by the time classic is planned to end.
---
Blizzard probably want to make sure classic is a success before they commit the resources needed to make a new expansion for classic, I'm sure they have goals that needs to be reached before they make a new expansion. Blizzard Activision is a business and unless they are guaranteed to make a profit I seriously doubt they are going to make a new expansion for classic, they got both TBC and WotLK they can release which require a lot less resources than building something new.

&gt; People ask super nooby questions all the time and get almost entirely genuine and kind answers.
---
And as long as everyone has the same answers, everything's fine. And the game's been around for 15 years, so luckily pretty much everyone's on the same page. There's a lot of groupthink. But once you get into nuanced opinions, or call someone on some made up facts, you get much lower than average emotional intelligence.
---
I never marked as the tank in vanilla.

People should know which mobs they need to CC and which mobs to attack. I knew the instance, I expected them to as well.

---
Use whatever you have that's best. After the epic hunter quest bow from Molten Core, the remaining best-in-slot weapons are all crossbows.
---
Whatever has the highest topend more or less
---
Unless something else has craaazy dps
---
Retail lacked the sense of accomplishment you felt after all those hours of hard work to level your character to Max level. What was sickening is they kept making leveling easier up to certain threshold points between expansions and reduced the need to explore each and every zone trying to level up.
---
Now while starting from level one you only had a small hand full of zones needed to clear through before you were lvl 60 and off exploring BC then you did maybe 2-3 zones before woosh off to Northrend and repeat.
---
And don't forget the changes to requirements for mount use and the costs. Lost all respect for earning your land mounts with that huge drop of level requirements. Then you also had the flying mounts that made it so could easily skip over the land and few fights to finish quests. One reason liked underwater zone from Cataclysm no flying mounts to superspeed and Dodge every little obstacle. Flight also killed the sense of accomplishment from exploring every inch of the world.
---
Also the queing for dungeons killed the thrill of being out on a quest to defeat some great enemy. I felt so lazy being able to just sit in a city all day and one click enter any dungeon in my level range. Even if I had never even gone out to where the dungeon was located and seen the entrance in person. Including dungeons that were located in enemy territory.
---
&gt;I think it's worth noting that the original devs are probably not with blizz anymore.
---
People like Mark Kern aren't anymore, yes, but are still very active &amp; influential in the WoW community. There most likely are a few devs still with Blizz that were there in the early 2000's...whether they're still on WoW, or other projects, idk. But they have people like Omar who have a genuine love for Vanilla working on it now.
---
Plus I wouldn't be surprised if they hired a few of the Nost guys behind the scenes. Don't want to make it too public though since that only encourages running private servers as an "application" to the company.
---
Bows will always out do guns at 60, but while levelling it’s more of a case of whatever you can get your hands on
---
Barrens ?
---
Yeah, have you heard about how Stardew Valley fans murders a whole town?
---
True, it's like the word "bigot".  By the strict definition of the word, if you really don't like a bigot, you are one too.
---
The general theory from private servers is that TPS is king and mitigation is less important. But on private servers the values for boss avoidance is completely wrong. They parry less, which means they output less damage.
---
You're going to be saving a lot of mana when your tank is dead.
---
Hot take. Classic is not Vanilla. It can and should have updates as time goes by and the vanilla content is exhausted.
---
Barrens at around 12 of course.
---
Here comes the backpaddler.
---
The T2 set got a lot of Stamina which could be compared to the pvp set so I don't see why it wouldn't be good for pvp.
---
5% more pet damage is way mire relevant in pve than a bit of int
---
I'm gonna state my opinion, and it's probably going to be an unpopular one, especially on this sub, but it's the painful truth. I do think Blizzard is underestimating how popular Classic is going to be, but I also think a lot of fans, including a lot of people on this board like yourself are vastly OVERestimating it as well. Yes, it will be HUGE at first, and there will be a large community of people who will stick with it. But there are also a lot of people who will do exactly what was described in your post "wow this game sucks compared to retail" or get their nostalgia fix quit. Classic is not going to make or break retail.
---
MOST people who currently play retail will continue to play it. Some people may leave retail and stick with Classic, some people who quit may come back for Classic and then end up trying retail. In the end Classic is not going to kill retail or even surpass it like some people seem to think. I do think it's going to be more popular long term than Blizzard seems to think, but I also think there are a lot of fans who need to be more realistic with their expectations.
---
\&gt; dps
---
No, it's just by the pure damage output.
---
After everything you said I think you're literally a nazi. /s
---
It's not the userbase, it's the format. 
---
It glorifies uninformed opinions, by allowing people to pass judgement on topics anonymously, without having to open themselves up to criticism, or causing near as much discounting of their opinion, and it also makes it take far less effort to just be a negative jackass on reddit than any other format: if I were speaking to you in person, I would actually have to put effort into a criticism of what you say. Reddit makes it so that I can ACCIDENTALLY do that, by accidentally hitting downvote on my phone when  mean to hit "next page". That's how easy it is to submit a worthless negative opinion: I can do it by accident. 
---
This causes more negative responses than would happen in a normal format, and causes them to be weighted more highly than they deserve. 
---
Furthemore, when reddit decided to remove separate upvotes and downvotes and aggregate them into a single score, this toxic "downvote" behavior now acts as a noise floor that useful posts have to rise above. It is almost impossible for a post that has not been completely read to be upvoted, but it is trivial for a post that has not been completely read to be downvoted.
---
Beyond that, large subreddits seem to have a gatekeeping reflex, so any post that has any portential for benefiting the poster (such as a youtube channel with like 4 subscribers) gets a lot of downvotes if it is not, frankly, VASTLY superior in quality to the average post on the subreddit. So moderately decent content can be downvoted to oblivion because some guy has a youtube channel with 15 subscribers and no one wants him to get to 16. 
---
TLDR: reddit is absolute shit. Reddit is shit compared to reddit before they amalgamated downvotes and upvotes into a single score. Reddit is shit compared to digg, which it replaced. Reddit is shit compared to independent, separate forums, which digg replaced. 
---
Reddit is a cesspool that brings out the worst in humanity, and it is a true testament to how decent humanity can truly be that anything good happens on here, at all, ever.

Short term retailers are using would be my guess.

MCP is strictly a raid boss consumable so no need to worry about using it for anything else.
---
Most people just aren't going to spend 100g every week to have an optimal spec in both PVE and PVP, nor do they only PVP after all raids are done for the week. You're more likely to find that players bring one sub-optimal spec to both raids and battlegrounds, like 2H fury, seal fate rogue, etc.
---
Well bigger screen means more eye travel distance. Not sure if I would comfortable woth that screen for more that a few hours

Ah, mkay.

Just need wireless kb+mouse for maximum comfy. Seriously the new wireless mice are so good, don't hold back if you're worried about battery life or latency. I was a naysayer too but my G703 is really good and durable, dropped it off the side of my couch maybe 6 times now and it still works perfect. Battery lasts 2 full days of play easily and charges quickly with cable, can be used while charging etc. I'm not trying to shill for logitech, the other brands have some good wireless mice too i'm sure. But once you go wireless + couch you cant go back its just so damn comfy. Not the best for serious PvP though keyboard on lap makes it hard esp for classic and expansions where you have like 50 keybinds.
---
So does that mean you are going to suck it up in pvp and play fury 2x one handers?
---
It all depends on the player... if you're willing to farm out 100 gold per respec so you can do a "round trip respec" well then that's your choice. 
---
But then do you plan to do other stuff at that time, or just hella farm so you can always respec?
---
Ugh, rank 14.

Everyone taking a week off work for this game is gonna be doing it to get to 60, but the honor grind, that will be the true test.

Then I played one myself and oh boy, it is really hard if you want to bring all your tools to the party.
---
Yes or find a build that works best for you (ie hybrid).
---
Yeah exactly. This subreddit is a bit of an echo-chamber because we're all excited for Classic, but the world isn't. It will get tens of thousands of players, but those numbers will drop off eventually. Blizzard are right to be conservative.
---
I think that's probably the play, considering the rarity of brutality blade and vis'kag.
---
Never knew Zandalar was ever considered that close to STV. BFA's main continents are cut EK subzones lol.
---
I think at this point, most people have played both factions at some point, or they will be with Classic. It also helps that we're now 12 anymore.
---
I think the first toilet I saw was in Grizzly Hills. a few years too late for the Human to hold it in!
---
It will entirely depend on your spec, but in general the priority is +healing &gt; spirit &gt; mp5 &gt; intellect &gt; spell crit
---
Yes, but the world, and gaming, are also very different now. Fifteen years is a long time.
---
Let's be honest WoW vanilla is slow, and a dad game at this point. I couldn't even imagine being interested in watching someone else play it.
---
I will help explain.  Imagine being paid to work on a project for years, pouring effort into it, and a group comes along and says "this sucks, it was better before you meddled with it".  You'd probably disagree with them instinctively and be in denial at the very least.
---
Of course, you get into psychological issues where creating a successful vanilla without any changes is almost a conflict of interest for them, because if it's successful, what does that say about their work on retail? Brack even jokingly mentioned he was worried, but I think there's some truth there.
---
If I'm on the Blizzard board of directors, I see that consumers think the game was better before I hired these devs/presidenr to make the game better, maybe I start to think I hired the wrong people.  It's not a good look for the president of the company that's been telling me for years they've been improving the game and that the people who want vanilla are just fringe idiots.  It's not a good look for anyone that worked on retail.
---
It's a bit more complex to set up but has a lot of settings you can tweak, can add multiple layers of videos, transparent images &amp; videos and can also be used for streaming. It's quite the potent program and I can't recommend it enough!

This is when you have 2 of the same characters , 1 pvp and 1 pvp.

You can think what you want, that won't reflect reality.

*want* a kodo? Who the f wants a kodo
---
Oof
---
Really cool mate!
---
Or maybe you learn to read. I am talking about snipers. Snipers are bad, just like people who ninja pull and over-aggro. These are bad habits and sniping heals is just one of those bad habits as well.
---
&gt;That doesn't matter. It's about the ability to lose a cast of healing from any healer(s).
---
This means being sniped.
---
When you have people sniping your healers i.e.
---
&gt;If you have 2 paladins sniping every healer
---
then as result:
---
&gt;you'll have other healers performing badly because of that
---
Then the Issue is:
---
&gt;Those 2 paladins are the issue (read: bad players), not the other way around.
---
You are clearly not a healer. I am talking about the scenario where in fact the paladin is *sniping*. Which was the very original OP:
---
&gt;Alliance raid healing is all about heal sniping every other class with Flash of Light as a holy paladin, so you can have the highest healing numbers by the end of the raid. Easy game easy life
---
You overestimate the average gamer today. I can't wait for Classic and I plan to play only it once it releases ... but if you think Classic is going to revolutionize the current gamer culture then I think you are going to be surprised. A lot of people are going to login (because the hype is real) and then quit.
---
Classic is going to be huge, not only are the ones that played it 15 years ago going to play it but a large portion of the players that have heard those players talk about it over those 15 years will also. This might very well become the biggest launch blizzard has ever done.
---
A lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
---
Or a less nerdy way: who gives a fuck, people who expressed an opinion like that probably masturbate over their mount collection
---
Did U Check the Beta Rep values? Pservers are Off by a Lot right now, for alliance its Impossible to get anywhere near exalted Without massive runecloth Turbine :(
---
&gt; This is an interesting point, is there any source for claiming that the legacy player base is larger than the current retail subscriptions 
---
Source? No.
---
Educated, logical guess? Yes.
---
Over 100 million people played WoW from 2004 to 2014, and based on numbers, about 70% of them played in Vanilla+TBC+Wrath. That is 70 million POTENTIAL players out there. DO you think it is far fetched to assume that 10% of them will return for Classic?
---
10% is like NOTHING. However, that 10% is SEVEN MILLION players.
---
This is a problem that MOST people don't understand. They think it's CRAZY to have 7-8 MILLION people returning for Classic...but they do not understand that it's just a MERE 10% of the former player base.
---
Classic launch will be the BIGGEST event in gaming history. Nobody will believe the numbers at launch.NOBODY.
---
Well, except people like me, who realize that 10% of the former players is actually a very REALISTIC expectation.
---
Nah no way that would happen. Classic will still use the current battle.net infrastructure - meaning friends lists and paying your sub all happen through it. Although I think you can still launch the game from the .exe you can still log in manually, but I'm not sure if that method doesn't also automatically launch the b.net launcher in the background
---
There's a reason that tweet is deleted. Weakauras later went out and apologized for jumping the gun. The numbers were just wrong.
---
People have 10 years more vanilla experience than you, thry know better.
---
Yeah right because that doesn‘t require 10 times the time investment compared to just farming the 100g/week
---
Not really, standard raid spec means you don't even use a pet because you sacrifice it. Unless you're the dedicated imp warlock who's assigned to the tank group you don't use an imp. And even if you are the imp warlock your imp's dps is marginal in the first two raid tiers because bosses are immune to fire and trash has high fire resistance.

I think this is accurate.  I think you have the devs and president that absolutely want Classic to fail because if it were successful it would prove their work in retail was shit, which it was.  They, in turn, spread that ideology, likely suggesting to reduce resources into Classic, implying Classic will just compete with retail, etc.  Blizzard's board and shareholders want Classic to succeed.  Their management doesn't.
---
What are you going to do on your Lock if not pvp? They arent exactly the most fun thing to play in raids..
---
&gt; Classic IP
---
lmao
---
I see
---
Hey thx man! Was not sure.
---
Boby Kotik maybe won't be embarassed when classic buys him another ferrari, but the team working on retail definetly will.
---
They should , like they have StarCraft 1 its own tab
---
If you intend to play shadow pve keep in mind Berserking doesn't work on dots and mind flay only on mindblast and you can get 2 mindblasts in a Berserking 
---
The 2 troll priest racials aren't that useful in pve compared to devouring plague 
---
I'd say for pve undead, for pvp it's 50/50 personal pref
---
Is tier 1 your only aspiration? Tier 2 wont be hard to get for the average player. If you ask about Tier 2 my answer changes.
---
My friends did it?
---
There have been no "reliable reports" of sub numbers since WoD. Trust me when I say I dislike BfA as much as the next guy, probably more, but making shit up does not help your cause at all.

y tho
---
Why not the best of the three? Orc.
---
Why the hell he has so much channels, like seriously? Tired of blocking them on yt
---
Unless they just do more aggressive layering. Honestly, that's one of my fears. What happens if the expected launch crowd doesn't leave and you end up with servers that rely on layering to function going into phase 2?
---
How about both tier 1 and 2?
---
You can land on those windows.
---
&gt; It's not the userbase, it's the format. 
---
One drives the other. The circlejerk attracts people who desire a circlejerk.
---
Decide if PVP or PVE is more important to you. Or you could consult the [coin oracle.](https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin)
---
Lol, everything else. I played a gnome lock during vanilla and loved it, including raids. Hated pvp back then, got used to it over the years but not my favorite thing to do. Now that I am disabled pvp is pretty much out of the question so I'm looking forward to doing everything thing else in the game that I'm able to do.
---
Assuming you're not going for BiS since Shamans don't really wear tier for 1/2. Priests have the advantage of most of their BiS stuff also being tier sets.
---
Either way, priest T1 is way better, especially on an undead with Benediction.
---
I'll be rolling horde. So here, have an upvote. And my sword!
---
Every race has a base 5% stun resist. Orcs get another 25%. 30/5 = 6.
---
I think it goes up each time IIRC
---
I read his point as more "Are the other 3 rogues in the guild friends/family of Officers/GM" As that would vastly decrease your chances of receiving loot as the 4th rogue in a guild.
---
If Classic fails and layering was included, I blame Blizzard 100%.  If they remove/ severely limit layering and still Classic fails, it has nothing to do with Blizzard.
---
I'm actually not sure if I agree. I totally see your point, and I, too, disliked having a to-do list all the time during TBC and Wrath (didn't play after that) - but at the same time it was kinda cool. Daily quests sucked, though, I hated that you'd just do those for "casual" gold-making, rather than figuring out a clever way to use your profession, farm certain mobs, etc. Everyone would just do the same daily quests. 
---
I did enjoy heroic 5-mans in TBC though, they were super tough, especially, in my experience, as a healer. Raid healing can be kinda boring and repetitive, and 5-man healing in vanilla will quickly become easy with gear. 5-man heroics in TBC were tough as nails, even in almost full T4 - and having those tokens in the game "forced" you to play them once in a while.
---
Yeah I can see classic failing as well. But only once people realise they have neglected it and made it worse. At least pservers will get some real values and will probably spring up better because of it. But god please Blizzard DO NOT FUCK THIS UP. I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY MONEY.
---
doesn't change the fact that it is illegal.
---
Private servers are redistributing content owned by Blizzard Entertainment without express permission. Like i said it doesn't matter that the code is different, they are redistributing assets like quest text, npcs, items, etc without Blizzard's permission. Therefore, it is illegal.
---
Don't know why this isn't blatantly obvious, many veteran private servers players including myself know that playing private servers are illegal and this is why.
---
i think everything looks ugly on a troll, especially on a  male.  
---
So Shaman, Tauren all the way !  
---
Priest go for undead, becasue troll is ugly.  
---
Please stop trolling !
---
Equal in population != Equal in bg-players pop. A lot more pvp players roll horde for better racials, so if the population is the same overall, there will be more pvp-ers horde side.
---
Similarly, more hardcore pvers that have little interest in pvp roll alliance side.
---
Hell, in classic there were more alliance overall but horde still had longer queue times because of way more queued horde players.
---
Agree with everything, but want to add that if you are mainly flash healing (which you should not do, but I see alot of fresh priests do). You should prioritize int, Mp5  equal to or higher than +healing (I have not done the math).
---
Layering is needed for the launch so servers do not burn and you dont have to fight about every single mon with 100 other people. Didnt they say they will reduce it with time and when playerbase normalize?
---
Interesting to see Dire Maul was planned to be on the opposite continent originally
---
!remindme 9 hours
---
&gt;"I could easily see the outcome being people logging in, going 'Wow, the game is so much better now,' and logging out," explained Blizzard community manager Josh "Lore" Allen when asked about vanilla servers."
---
That's literally the guy who said `you think you do, but you don't`. Why the fuck is he in charge of anything related to Classic?
---
There's still no use speculating that queue times should be considered when choosing a faction in Classic.
---
&gt; nor can you be trusted
---
good thing I won't leave them much say in this. also good that trust is gained, not granted. after people get their stuff they'll know and remember.  
---
isn't it awkward that you are so adamant against a principle which works in best interest for everyone involved?  
---
valuable items. as in, couple hundred gold valuable.  
---
if you want to equip those and pass up on your share for a few gold pieces. be my guest.

Ah, I didn't know about the base 5% stun resist. That makes 100% sense now! Thanks for the quick reply!!

Tywin sure was a quote guru.
---
Even troll priest?  I think it looks great!
---
I really dont know. I only played a moonkin during vanilla but I remember voidwalkers being a lot worse than hunter pets and I assume bears have to be better than those.
---
&gt;Especially since the retail directors are working on classic as well, like Ion himself
---
That would be true if he were making a new product, but he's not.  If Classic success&gt; retail, it shows the board of directors they've been paying people to improve a game but they have only made the game worse.
---
I generally agree that Classic being successful will be good for those in charge of bringing it to market, but it's certainly not going to look good for the "creative" minds behind retail.
---
I don't think you understand what's going to happen. The auto-reply blacklist addon has already been ported to Classic.
---
Every single time you say "LFG" in chat, someone's addon is going to spit out "Don't group with Lharts, he Master Loots everything and just expects you to trust him that he'll mail you the profits later".
---
You're not going to have ANY success trying to enforce this.
---
It's your mom's default
---
Gonna five it a go then! Thanks
---
maybe female, but defintly not a male.  
---
I dont play troll because i think its ugly.  
---
But the mount on the other hand, i find it cool :D
---
&gt; The shareholders will be extremely happy if they see any kind of return from it. 
---
Clearly you never traded market shares.
---
The shareholders DON'T LIKE SURPRISES, be it negative or positive. They like SOLID, PLANNED EXPECTATIONS.
---
They will be extremely UNHAPPY if Classic exceeds Blizzard's expectations...because they LOST A GOLDEN opportunity to BUY IN shares on a product that was deemed "mediocre, or moderate, at best", and instead it was proven to be a massive success.
---
Overplaying and underplaying a product to shareholders, is how you LOSE them and their money.
---
Look at ATVI shares in the last year. They dropped like a rock because the products were OVERPLAYED (BfA, CoD, Overwatch, Diablo ficking Immortal).
---
Blizzard has created a culture of denial. The consensus is that retail is the best version ever, everything is good and the numbers lies for some reason. They might spend millions on trying to figure out why it's bad, while looking around the elephant in the room, because it can't be the elephant. There is just no way.

---
⌚ **Raid times**:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📋 **Goals**: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 **Loot**: Loot Council
---
☎ **Contact**: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)

No, its the cure poison consumables you can craft with first aid. It has no cd, but it can get expensive to spamm it and it is a pain to farm.
---
I mean, by all accounts it looks very very likely horde will have longer queue times like they always have. How is there no use in speculating??
---
My biggest gripe is TV delay... makes me vomit just thinking about it.
---
There's a whole thread on this, but basically layering causes a ton of issues, some subtle, some noticably severe.  All to solve a problem that isn't really a problem: people not being able to level as fast as they want.
---
(It's actually designed to solve other problems too, but is a terrible solution to them.  Check out the layering thread and sort by "Top" and you'll see reasonable criticism)
---
Yep, also from the book, SFK was originally going to be the "undead newbie dungeon" like RFC is to the horde in general.
---
Because the moment they introduced cross-realm battlegrounds, the queue times for both factions become inconsequential and we won't be experiencing battlegrounds without it. And it won't even be battlegroups like before, every realm within a region will be linked to the same queues.
---
Casualls ............ !!!!! Get a chair and a desk otherwise you will be obliterated !!!
---
Man the critic was an awesome cartoon
---
&gt; They're the same group of people who created one of the biggest troll guides in the private server scene, the exploration exp guide that told people to run off into the world and not kill any mobs so they could have more mobs for themselves in the starting zones.
---
lmao i always suspected that was the case, glad to be proven right. truly based
---
Thanks for clarifying I couldn't remember it
---
Lmao so you can have what gear? This is as dumb as an idea possibly gets.
---
There's been a leak, which made its way thorugh many games media websites back in October. I'd say that's credible enough and certainly not something I made up.
---
Josh Allen is a moron and everything he says should be disregarded
---
You would be able to play without layering.  Blizzard and technology have grown far more than sub numbers.  They are more than capable of having enough servers to smoothly launch the game.  If people try to play all on one server because of a streamer, that's on them.
---
Sounds like a good way of getting their questions answered
---
No worries, stuff happens. 😁
---
One problem here. People don't start playing games because they have micro transactions. Yes, this is modern game design, but it's not what gets people to play a game. It's just a mechanic designed to get more money from stupid consumers. Everyone and their mother hates micro transactions and wants games without it. Certainly, the lack of microtransactions will not be an issue for Classic. The issue will more likely be that it requires a sub fee. Most succesful modern games are free to play with micro transactions to get a huge potential audience.
---
At this point, how succesful Classic will be is purely speculation. Blizzard seems to believe it won't be and the Classic audience for the most part believe it will be succesful. So, there is a huge discrepancy between the Classic audience and Blizzard. The lack of trust in Classic seems to be the main reason for the low amount of servers we're getting, layering and the lack of RpPvP servers. The Classic community still feels kind of left out when compared to what Blizzard does for retail WoW. We seem to be just a not so important afterthought.
---
And Zandalar (newest expansion)
---
Well, for GTA you have to consider which GTA he plays.
---
GTA 5 single player is micro transaction free, while GTA online is a micro transaction swamp. If he just played GTA 5 for the first time, he likely plays single player.
---
72 runs, that's how many it took me to complete my set. mostly due to my awful luck at rolling.
---
Yeah, that's brutal. Good luck!
---
cheers , thanks
---
That's working under the assumption the people working on BFA are actually proud of their work. I wouldn't be surprised if they're just in it for the paycheck at this point, BFA has been uninspiring across the board.
---
Lore-wise it makes more sense.  The ogres came through the Dark Portal as well.  The idea that any of them got over to Kalimdor is a bit of a stretch.
---
Chromatically Tempered Sword was always my rogue tmog weapon until I quit retail, looked so cool with the bloodfang set, just two swords striking from the shadows
---
On Horde side often you will spam the hell out of Flash of Light and leave all the AoE healing to Shamans. Because Flash of Light has a 1.5 sec cast time, same as the GCD, you won't actually gain any HPS with Berserking. Other abilities such as Holy Nova, Renew and Power Word: Shield don't gain anything from Berserking either. Berserking for Priests is really lackluster compared to Shamans who have their main heal (Chain Heal) on a 2.5 sec cast time.  
---
Is Troll still the best? Yes, but how much will you gain? Barely anything. Priests often don't have a Shaman in their group because Windfury is reserved for Melee. If you want to play UD you can easily justify it by healing through fears on Onyxia and Nefferian, during those times it can make the difference between saving the tank or letting him die.
---
Ah you also prefer looking at the classic logging screan instead of playing retail? Welcome to the club!
---
Cool setup btw
---
The guy who goes to a major city every time they level up to train skills and waste all their money at the AH thinking they’ll level faster that way
---
I was the same. Then I saw layering was a thing. Now I cant play and that just makes me sad.
---
Blizzard is a company, they want profits so it’s only logical for them to be extremely skeptical and cautious about this project. 
---
Private servers been going strong for a decade? What? I think we need to define strong here lol. They all tend to die out because of many different reasons a lot of them being bullshit. Those who don’t most likely never had more than 100k online combined.
---
If 50k people play classic religiously (that’s probably all vanilla private servers combined) it’s not a success, it will likely be considered quite a big failure and you can kiss your hopes goodbye about ever seeing a patch after 1.12 or TBC and Wrath. 
---
I prefer to be open minded and view things as objectively as I can, and I can perfectly understand the comments Josh made. The very thing he said applied to myself when I started playing on Nostalrius, and I would’ve quit before I hit level 20 if I didn’t get a few of my friends to play. I felt bored very quickly because everything felt slow and sluggish and repetitive. Nothing was exciting because I had seen it most of it before. 
---
I expect a lot of people will quit before phase 1 is even half way through. I expect a lot of my friends will quit like 90% of them because real life takes too much time for most people to invest sitting playing WoW all day, and because non of them shows any interest in playing WoW at all except 2 or 3.
---
Please understand gaming in general has changed a lot since classic WoW was a thing. It’s a business and it’s only becoming bigger and bigger it’s not just nerds making games for other nerds like it used to be. Current WoW is really really light on micro transactions so I personally think you are being slightly unfair. Everything is cosmetic and you don’t have to buy anything at all for you to play or enjoy the game, so I wouldn’t say they’re milking it that way.
---
“Old school and faithful” huh? Why do I get the feeling they quit long ago and aren’t exactly the type I would describe as faithful ;)
---
I hope Classic becomes a success but I can easily see it go both ways so I’m trying to hold back a little on my predictions and just let time tell me exactly who’s right and who is wrong.
---
Sure, but doesn't change the fact that that's exactly what most modern remasters amount to (of course there are exceptions). I don't see how Classic can be categorized as an expansion instead of a remaster. It's it own standalone thing, expansions add on to the current game.
---
That said, whether it warrants a separate tab in the launcher, I don't know. Starcraft 1 got its tab after Starcraft remastered came out, but personally it makes no difference for me. Checking a drop down isn't difficult or inconvenient to me.
---
Spamming FoL is a very newb Priest thing to do, but you're wrong in any case. Haste effects reduce the GCD.
---
Unless you are raiding in a hardcore gear, and specially if you have the raid on farm, you can totally PvE in a PvP spec. It won't matter.
---
OP healers. They break faces with 2h reckoning but need gear to pull it off. Don't see why you think they are bad at 60.
---
I am happy about classic and can’t wait to play it again, but I don’t understand why people have to shit on BfA version all the time. People used to shit on vanilla being the easy mmo with the children’s graphics. Did you like that?
---
Can i ask to be able to play on Windows 98/XP like during Vanilla then ? 
---
I'm not against spellbatching/leeway. It **shouldn't** be removed since it was here but they could adapt it to the modern hardware. Like i have to adapt my computer/hardware to play Classic.
---
Was mostly talking about when you're solo in the open world, cause you know there are things to do outside wsg :p
---
It's probably Thaddius, people (me included sometimes) would just ridiculously not make the jump to the platform all the time at least in my guild.
---
Because mages generally don't need the hit due to elemental precision, and the fact that they get hit from their head/leg enchants?
---
The post is not funny and/or not too relevant to a lot of people
---
casuals...smh
---
He hasnt played before
---
and healer that has a 2.5 sec heal that heals 750dmg and costs 100 mana would cast it 20 times in 50 sec to heal 15 000dmg and use 2000. Now he has to heal 16500 and he has to cast 22 heals instead of 20 heals that cost 2200 mana.
---
Understood, have a nice day!
---
You might think so, but that's how some people did it.
---
&gt; legacy players
---
That's me. Played for a month or two at launch. Then again at the end of TBC and stopped during WotLK. Even if I love classic I'm unlikely to play it for an extended period of time. I've never really done that in the past.
---
More people I know are getting into FF14 right now. That game has some serious polish. It's a lot more casual than WoW but I think I'm okay with that.
---
So I'm actually starting to wonder if I'd have more fun playing FF14 than replaying the classic wow content.
---
Or you know, not getting sucked into either. I have a good hobby going right now learning to speedrun old NES and SNES games. I've made a lot of friends that way via twitch. We race regularly, hang out in discord voice chat, and I've even met some of those folks IRL. It's all the social interaction I'm looking for from an MMO except that when there is a grind it's because I chose to grind. The achievements are all internally motivated. I set goals in the games and see if I can achieve them.
---
Lul that's pretty tame compared to my last guild's raid leader
---
Just because your friends don’t have lives doesn’t mean everyone doesn’t either
---
This was a night elf we all know they're ghey, Don't blame this on the dwarfs and gnomes!
---
I'm thinking buy the mats on the AH and sell them for a small profit. Lazier pvpers may buy them?
---
you're saying he has 5 str on all his gear combined in 'bis' gear?
---
Not to mention it takes a ton of durability dmg
---
Oh I get it the lock is SM Ruin because he's in the tank group
---
The dragon kiting was at the end of the stress test, there were plenty of horde there way before that
---
Whilst true that I will eventually choose the race I like most, I haven't seen all races and their animations / cosmetics as a hunter yet. So I decided to ask you guys for your opinion!
---
lore aspect as the different races had drastic different perspectives. I find it really disppointing they didn't do something similar with paladins especially not make Belf paladins "blood knights" post vanilla. Other classes simply dont have the same lore implications as far as race is concerned. wouldnt make since for warlocks since lorewise they're a rarity anyway. melee classes just swing thing all race can use their hands fine. mages could perhaps have sometype of school difference but im not gonna touch mage lore with anyones staff, shamans should just have racial totems imo or you may get into some serious balance issues. Druids are locked to one race/faction so pretty much already there.
---
I'll admit I was a legolas during vanilla. This time around I don't plan on minmaxing as much!
---
No, this isn't a sound argument. Just because one thing is being changed, doesn't give merit to another being changed. We're getting auto-loot, does that mean we should get AoE-loot? We're getting Battle.NET, does that mean we should get cross-realm? We're getting the modern API and addons, does that mean we should have modern UI from Blizzard? We're getting 1.12 itemization but does that mean every 1.12 exploit should be in the game? We're getting Discord, does that mean we should have LFG/LFR? We're getting loot trading, does that mean we should have guild banks? We won't have blob shadows, does that mean we should use the new models? We have much more knowledge and skill, does that mean raids should be tuned to be harder?
---
Just no.
---
It will fail if u dont mass report everyone right now for spam so they will take it out takes 10 for silience NO MODERATOR AT ALL REPORT FOR SPAM
---
&gt;a recreation of Vanilla WoW
---
Was layering in Vanilla?
---
No matter how far...
---
Then just go look them up in the Wowhead dressing room.
---
I am really afraid that blizzard is LYING to us again like they did, when first introduced “Layering”. 
---
Ion first stated that it would ONLY be in starting zones. 
---
Later Omar and the other dev told that they made this “new” system, wich is just sharding; now just spelled as layering. A little bit different, but still works similarly.
---
They went from starting zone to all server, with multiple mobs/chests etc. This can only go wrong. 
---
They are trying to re-create classic, but as always activision-blizzard fail hard. 
---
I am so sad that blizzard just cant listen to their fan base once and give AUTHENTIC experience and not this activision inspired crap.....
---
I bet if you blacklist my guild and we find out about it you suffer more than we do, and it isnt because you're word of mouth blacklist matters half a fuck, its because we want to prove a point.
---
"Could just prepare servers"
---
... 
---
Thats not how that works
---
&gt;Berserking best racial
---
For most DPS classes berserking is a pretty straight forward and clear cut DPS increase because they're always casting/attacking but for holy/shadow priest the benefit is a lot less evident. Shadow doesn't benefit from haste and healing spells only gain a very marginal HPS increase in most scenarios.
---
The raw HPS value of berserking is not as high as one might assume if one approaches it from the traditional point of view of a DPS class where quicker cast speed = more good. First of all you can achieve similar results by casting higher ranks of the same heal. Obviously that's slightly more costly, but not as much as you'd think.
---
So If you're casting a 2.5s cast spell, 10% haste saves you 0.25 seconds per cast. In order for berserking to actually net a priest healer an additional spell cast the bossfight must last long enough that you get three full uses of berserking - that's 9 minutes of straight bossfight. Not even Kel'thuzad lasts that long. I personally think that berserking is a lot less useful for healers since you're not always casting - you're often not casting and waiting for people to take damage.
---
&gt;Shadowguard
---
Since shadowguard only procs when you get hit its utility in pve is somewhat limited in comparison to pvp where you're getting hit all the time.
---
&gt;Touch of Weakness has one charge
---
Nothing stopping you from recasting it though should you need to and unlike shadowguard you don't lose out by downranking it. The only cost incurred is having to spend a gcd every time you refresh it. Not much reason to take blackout in any pve spec though.
---
&gt;Devouring Plague is fairly useless
---
This one I actually straight up disagree with. It costs a lot of mana, but that can be offset by inner focus. It is otherwise not a bad spell at all.
---
&gt;WotF only redeeming quality of UD
---
Let's say this were the case which it should be clear by now I don't believe it is, WotF is still the best racial in the game. Having a reliable fear breaker as a healer is priceless when used properly because it lets you take back control of a fight at your choosing when you'd otherwise not have that option.
---
Can u please explain the math done behind that 10% statement?
---
Feralas and Desolace hadn't been fully conceptualized and Dire Maul would have been in Alterac now that's weird.
---
Not sure why anyone would level as holy on a priest. You can put points in spirit tap and wand spec and have no down time from level 19 onwards.
---
No, which is why it's so controversial. But one change does not give merit to another being changed.
---
you shouldn't My favorite ace is dwarf. I'd recommend Tauren though, great city and hunter friendly start zone. You do get a bigger hitbox but more importantly bigger gear! imagine your tauren hunter showing off that thunderfurry. Also as a cow taming animals there is whole slew of funny name/pet name combos.
---
Making a game feel like a chore. What amazing game design, Ion. I'm glad his analytics dictate this is what's fun for players
---
He's talking about the haste racial from trolls not the HP regen one so no if you really care about minmaxing trolls are better for PVE.
---
I am going to say no to the shaman/priest there.  Spirit tap + wands make priests have almost no downtime with good kill speed.  Enhance shaman with shield has decent kill rate, little downtime (drink occasionally), and you have ghost wolf to speed up.  Rogue + pally are pretty bad though but IMO about same tier as warrior.
---
Time lapse on chromag I'm pretty sure is the only time it's useful that I'm aware of. That said it a plus and a minus here depending where you are on threat.
---
Well you could  sell it to the vendors and they will sell it on the market..
---
I honestly am that kind of guy spending days only in the AH so i would like that, just not in classic
---
It was actually a thing to sell mats to other players so that they can sell it on the AH, especially in Wotlk.
---
Less work for Farmers
---
I had success in the past, I will this time. don't worry. its not your problem really.
---
still super awkward that you think a fair system would cause negative repercussions of any sort.  
---
all I will do is make sure that everyone gets a piece of the cake.  
---
if you are not cool with that, suit yourself. you don't have to participate. 
---
the same I said before applies. the guys that don't want a fair environment can fuck right off. thats ok.
---
Again, you call it fair, but it's not.
---
If layering doesn't get fixed and by fixed I mean totally removed I'm going to be so disappointed and probably quit again. The whole idea of layering is anti vanilla.
---
Why don't they open servers to allocate the number of players at launch and do planned realm merges 1-3 months in?
---
I don't get it
---
Because unless you're going Soul Link full big dick 31 points into Demo, most of the time you'll be running around without a pet at 60.
---
As someone else already stated: Classic is brutal for hybrids and support classes. Better to focus on what your class is actually good at.
---
What most people dont know is that you can use the 3 White Xbows from the vendor in the early level range which are pretty much one of the best weapons, because they have fixed damage instead of a damage range. [Light Crossbow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=158079), [Fine Light Crossbow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15808) and [Heavy Crossbow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15809).
---
This. They didn’t even know how a bunch of exploits were happening for ages. I got to see first-hand people duping TCG mounts over the years among other stuff and outside of a niche community - Blizzard legit didn’t know how it was happening.
---
Is that Vsauce?
---
quite big graphic overhauls/higher rez/better textures, bug fixes, often some form of new content, some rebalance and such   
---
New crash games are perfect example of remasters   
---
classic has almost none of it  
---
&gt;My comment was about you comparing classic to an expansion. Even a re-release (as you phrase it now) is more in line with a remaster than an expansion  
---
Expansion/version, same thing. Classic is an "expansion" just like any other wow version.
---
&gt;Shadow absolutely benefits from haste
---
No it does not and if you understood anything about caster mechanics you'd have already realized why that is the case. Mind Blast and Mind Flay both don't benefit from haste for two very different reasons. Mind Blast is a 1.5 second cast and if you reduce the cast time to below 1.5 seconds you're throttled by the global cooldown and must wait before you're allowed to cast another spell. And Mind Flay also doesn't benefit from berserking because it's a channel. It cannot be reduced below 3.0 second duration.
---
&gt;plenty of scenarios where a healer will be chain casting for the entire duration of the buff
---
At this point I'm starting to wonder if you even read what I posted. I specifically addressed this argument ahead of time when I mentioned that the HPS gain from berserking may be offset by casting a higher rank.
---
&gt;ToW is inferior to Shadowguard
---
Here we agree at least. My point was that they're both marginally useful, in different ways.
---
&gt;Devouring Plague
---
You use it all the time. You use it on trash, you use it while moving (Onyxia, Bug Trio, Battleguard Sartura, Ouro) etc. etc. etc.
---
&gt;WotF vs. Hardiness
---
We can argue this point until our faces turn blue. I don't want to waste your or my own precious time so if it's alright by you I'd rather just pull out of arguing for or against WotF.
---
everyone getting an equal amount of cash instead of one guy winning a roll and getting it all for himself is not fair how exactly?
---
whew
---
Ah, the "I've given up"-setup. Very reminiscent of my Classic days back then.
---
&gt;long
---
can u get t2 on release?
---
Actually Blizzard has a shocking record of handling dying servers.. Blizz hasn’t done much worth praise in nearly half a decade imo.
---
 If you play PvP as well as PvE orc is best from a powergamer perspective. Also it's helpful for my gnome warlock if many people follow your example! Would like to see a lot of orc rogues as well please, thanks in advance!
---
UNCLE CHAAARLES
---
Love streamer tears. Especially Soda who claims they are off welfare. Like he isnt grabbing donations on stream for a living.
---
And here's where you're just wrong. Haste reduces the global cooldown and *does* affect channeling cast time. If you were in the beta, you'd know this.
---
You need this [https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Rest-Mouse-Pad-Pocket/dp/B01M04BMBB/ref=sr\_1\_9](https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Rest-Mouse-Pad-Pocket/dp/B01M04BMBB/ref=sr_1_9)
---
Please be aware of the power of search engines.
---
Let me ask you this: If a report is wrong, but shows you in a bad light and is prominently displayed when people google you, wouldn't you take steps to prevent this false report from showing up?
---
Google results mean a lot, they can give credence and reliability to even potentially wrong statements. Every person, who wishes to inform themselves about something will first search it and get an impression about a topic. Googling might say, you are fraudster, doesn't matter that this statement is completely false, people whom you never met will engage with you under the assumption that you are a fraudster. This is how google rankings give reliability to statements and reports.
---
The simple fact, that Blizzard has done nothing to prevent the leak from showing up as a primary search result means the numbers are either pretty accurate or that they don't care about such negative publicity. Either case is not good.
---
So many questions. hd tv cant have a res Off 80x600...
---
I too feel the sexual tension when I land phat crits...
---
I regret to inform you, that with a plethora of experience as Paladin. They are actually very capable levelers, technically only as Ret; but with proper weapon progression. You have absolutely no downtime whatsoever, and are equipped to level to 60 in both questing or grinding.
---
Really, if you're competent in your class than all of them level at surprisingly quick paces. Just through pure observation I'd still say that solo Warrior is the slowest, but not by a whole lot compared to anything that isn't a Hunter or a Mage.
---
Yes, layering and sharding is a technology that allows you to lineary scale servers up and down. Almost on the fly. 
---
But you cant just put more load on a single server that easily.
---
Yeah I'll definitely enjoy boosting my more casual friends through low level dungeons. It's really satisfying when they get a big upgrade and it will help them level faster.
---
I am thinking in terms of initial months not several months or years.
---
Go for Tauren  
---
Always   /moooooooooooooo
---
paladin then rogue
---
Something that hasn't changed even in bfa is how fun massive aoe pulls are. I fucking love it
---
tbh I will play with the better graphics too. No reason to have an expensive gaming rig and not utilize it. Only foliage and water stays original.
---
Its anti-MMO. Imagine playing a Massive Multiplayer Online game and you are layered to the point you are alone in a zone with no other people around. Now keep in mind that there are tons of players in the zone actually but on a different layer.
---
Whoever thought this was a good idea should get fired imo. It goes against everything an MMO stands for.
---
No discussion needed about that. 
---
You could argue that its good for areas with alot of people but even then its bad. A high populated area is suppose to be.. crowded to the point you start to lag and shit.
---
Because some people aren't in it for the cash, they're in it for enchanting materials, or they need the cash right away, or they're better at selling items than you.
---
Your plan is fucking stupid and if you end up on my realm and faction, I will make sure everyone knows just how fucking stupid it is. Absolutely no one will group with you or if they do, you will not be allowed leader.
---
Not full T2, no, that's in BWL which is phase 3 some time in 2020. Means that PVP will be obtainable beforehand but *way* harder to get without BGs.
---

beta access and active sub, no classic wow for me yet though!
---
I used to do this back in the day but i had a wooden board in my lap i couldnt stand it otherwise. Nowadays if im not at my desk it just doesnt feel right.
---
Rushing to 60 is far from a Vanilla experience, the games pacing is so slow that it really doesn’t matter if you hit 60 in the first week or the second month.
---
Worrying about your place in the race to 60 is pretty stupid imo. People aren’t going to have to worry about “falling behind” until AQ release - and if you consider yourself hardcore you’ll have plenty of time.
---
Yeah I would get so discouraged to play if I missed a week of raiding and the mythic+ reward. Right now I'm planning on playing bfa purely for the lore. Gear doesn't matter when it gets obsolete in a few months
---
If you want to min-max of obvious choice is Troll for PvE.
---
If you are focused on which you will enjoy looking at the most I'd suggest joining a private server and make one of each and play a few levels. You'll get a feel of the animations and movement and I'm sure you can decide from that. 
---
I was deadset on Humans because I never really liked Gnome/Dwarf but I gave them a go on a private server now I'm leaning towards Gnome more (for min-max PvP)
---
Yeah I feel like my eyes hurt when playing wow from a distance
---
"Layering is bad. Vanilla is about people!"
---
"Grouping is inefficient!"
---
Mulgore: It will be the least crowded zone, because tauren are not as much played as undead and orcs.
---
Undeads are often 50% of the server population, orcs another 25-30% and trolls and tauren both around 10%.
---
I read your post title in the voice of Yoda.
---
I bet streamers are being paid by Blizzard to say layering is good. I haven’t heard anyone say anything negative about it.
---
Some people here are convinced there will be upwards of 10-30 layers. If there is only meant to be 6 potential lotus spawns in an hour, but we have even 10 layers - that means 60 lotus per hour generated onto the server..
---
The amount of layers is defined by the amount of players (at any level) joining the server - so we are creating extra layers and therefor “rare materials” indirectly based on the people who Blizzard don’t even think will hit 60..
---
Pservers had a similar yet slightly different problem with dynamic respawns. It was more efficient to level just through AoEing mobs in a group of mages. This led to the devastation of cloth prices on the server - too much was being generated through the spawn system.
---
If you look at the old WoW devs discussing the game you’ll realize that a lot of stuff that seems like technical limitations was actually a well thought out design choice. First one that comes to mind is the server cap (estimated 2.5k) - that cap was decided as the number were players will actually see a community instead of a faceless mob of players. This creates a feeling of cohesion in the server unparalleled by modern WoW.
---
The shield crest over your fireplace is off center and now it's literally the only thing I can look at or think about in this picture.  
---
Please fix it and repost.  
---
(Also, my level of jealousness at the maximum level of your WoW comfort is high. Well done.)
---
fuck em! I'M HERE TO MAKE HISTORY WITH YALL!!
---
They think they do but they dont.
---
Yeah, but there's second side to that coin: people who play private servers because they are free.
---
So the thing is shamans should be in 6-7 groups. If they aren't pick up an enhancement shaman just to have an extra.. shamans are this strong.  I love priest but keep thinking i should play shaman as they are as wanted as warriors in vanilla. Some person was trash talking me on this and i just linked him EVERY pserver video i could find from good guilds that rolled horde here and their and they all had at least 7 shamans. 
---
As such the likelihood of a shaman in your group should be decent. Also i think they are around 12-14% on surveys of pop which is 6 per raid.
---
They are most wasted in hybrid groups, and also **you shouldn't stack priests in single groups ideally as it limits their ability to use prayer of healing (its your group only) even if you PLAN on using them for ST healing**. This being said you are correct in that warrior , rogues, and the warrior tank groups need shamans.
---
But it doesn't really mimic gameplay from back then since infrastructure is far better resulting in lower ping for most people making the game play completely different. The whole idea of the system was to make it more of an even playing field for people with high ping. The logical thing to do it tune it to a lower level which would actually provide a better mimic of how it was for the majority of players.
---
Either the cave part of Hidden Enemies in Durotar from Thrall in Org,Delivery to Silverpine or Conscript of the Horde which  carries you into Barrens from Razor Hill
---
Just play on an RP server then you can walk the streets of stormwind selling fresh fish and bread.
---
&gt; Why would they not want it to happen?
---
Because a race to get world first that isn't over in hours creates publicity, community engagement and continued subscriptions.
---
&gt; They're just giving us the Classic game in it's finalised state, adjusting the fights because they don't want it to "get cleared too fast" is against the spirit of everything the community has been telling them
---
There is a vocal minority who yell very loudly that they want an unchanged MC, although they get quiet fast when you ask them if they *want* it to be so easy it is cleared in minutes. I think these are pirate server players who deep down don't want Classic to be a good game or to be challenging in any way, they see it only as a vehicle to validate their pirate server play with an easy win on Classic retail.
---
Plus there are a similarly vocal minority of embittered shut-ins who believe that Blizzard is the spawn of Satan and any changes they make will be the end of the world.
---
But I think the large majority of actual potential Classic subscribers want MC to be challenging enough for the majority of guilds that it takes weeks to clear.
---
The idea of using a mouse on the arm of a chair is giving me anxiety..
---
Pretty sure haste effected spells starting in 2.4
---
Flash heal spam is a valid way to play in MC. It just requires some consumable usage and downranking. Try to compete with hpallys in heal sniping with 2.5s cast time...
---
I was strictly speaking about you saying "that is not how math works" with regards to 10% more mana per minute comment above you. Just wanted to point out that in this case, it was exactly the way math worked.
---
&gt;*Accidentally aggros a second mob*

That might be the case, but it does affect spells in the Beta.

You don't understand how search engines work _at all_. Do yourself a favor and keep your tinfoil theories to yourself in the future.
---
They have a cd
---
Yes it does the batch was 400ms back the  and it will be so in Classic. It mimics gameplay from back then because no matter how good your internet is the 400ms batch is there.
---
&gt; That is not how maths works. Like at all. 
---
It's an approximation, obviously, but there's no fundamental mathematical error. If you take 10% more damage the healers have to cast 10% more heals and so spend 10% more mana. Or you die, I suppose, that's also an option.
---
Buy cheap vendor ammo for trash (Will hurt your zone-wide DPS a bit but whatever it is way cheaper) and craft your own ammo via engineering (or if bows via engineering and then converting via NPC to arrows) for bosses.  Doing it that way makes it cheap and take very little time as a few thorium nodes should supply you with a few stacks (been a long time so cant remember the details).
---
Classic is most likely in part a response to shrinking subscriber numbers for BfA, so yes I'd say they definitely changed their minds.

The best weapon in the game is a crossbow

Your hand gesture is the international sign for "Just fuck me up, bruh".

Some of the comments are even worse
---
First weekend, so like 3-4 days after launch ? Id say something between clearing WC to RFK with quests depending how hard you are going to hit the launch.
---
Or are you STARTING on the weekend and want to gather up and start from L1 ? Then mulgore, you can run in about 17 minutes from orc/troll area to mulgore start area gathering Ratchet, Crossroads and Camp flypoints in the way. With dying in certain spots.
---
Motherfucker, op took the words right out of my mouth!
---
I checked old dbs and there’s plenty 10/25/75 etc quests, and I included those values, seemed accurate for what I remember and even if some are missing, aslong as you do what you can to complete quests at correct level for max rep gain you can get rest from flower turnins both for thunderbluff and darnassus :) and gain gold during soil farming too!
---
neither of these things are related to spell batching.

How about you take your lying butt over to the wow wiki and read the [official patch notes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0) for patch 2.4.0 yourself, specifically [this section about spell haste](https://i.imgur.com/0xTmkpl.png) and stop talking about stuff that you clearly don't know anything about.
---
You've been caught bluffing and it's embarrassing how you keep insisting you know things about the game that you clearly don't.
---
The big one is demonic runes, they are painful to farm solo.
---
I believe the 5% crit are mandatory until you've got really good gear, so it's probably not an option to skip that early on.
---
When I see gnome, I wanna stomp!
---
I have a recliner at my desk, I’ve used it for the past 10 or so years for gaming.

He didn't say the quote lol.

Funny, I also wanna roll (Resto!) Shaman and don't know if I go male Tauren, female Orc, male Orc or female Troll :-D
---
Really hard to decide from an aesthetic standpoint...
---
HELP!
---
btw: Leveling as Enhance, but Endgame as Resto...
---
Your honestly completely ignoring the point, I think you know that. With the majority of people having far better ms the 400ms batch makes a massively different change to the game. It's obvious the damage it does to the gameplay based on all the videos where spell batching is negating abilities completely.
---
Wardrums on both sides, today alliance dies!
---
&gt; If you were in the beta, you'd know this.
---
&gt; Yes, but your goal when raiding isn't to keep the healers' mana bar full it's to kill bosses.
---
Everyone knows this. The healers spending 10% more mana is only an issue if they don't have 10% more mana to spend. But if they don't have that mana to spend everyone gets a ghost run and a repair bill.
---
And in real vanilla, raids did wipe sometimes because the healers went OOM.
---
is t2 dragonstalker armor?
---
Blizzard didn't lie, they listened to this community, on this very subreddit, and changed sharding.

Honestly, if layering affects the gameplay too much, I will switch back to pservers. But let‘s stay calm, there is enough time left to fix it.
---
No ivory raptor available. Kodo it is.
---
The blizzard issue is at least partially beause of (maybe a bug) where blizzard doesnt apply damage on the first click + position interpolation. Even with batching you can barely move one stop i and one step out within the window.
---
And isn't the window 200ms anyway?? That's what [wowhead says](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow).
---
Started in vanilla. Played all of TBC and all of Wrath (though took a break during TOC because who didn't).
---
Quit weeks into Cata when I realised how much they'd fucked the game up, skipped all of Mists, came back to raid in WoD (mistake) and Legion (less of a mistake but still). Haven't even glanced at BFA after the reception.
---
I just explained to you with concrete examples including some maths that that is not how the game works and you just repeated the same incorrect observation that I refuted.
---
Either you're trolling or you're an idiot, but either way you and I are done talking to each other for good.
---
100 million is crazy, I'll def need a source for that since it's known that blizzards active sub count peak during WotLK with around 12 million.
---
[Source](http://powerwordgold.blogspot.com/2013/07/world-of-warcraft-subscribers-2005-2013.html)
---
I know some subs leave while other's join, but go from 12 million to 100 million is a bit of a stretch, don't ya think?
---
&gt; If your guild is wiping due to lack of total healing throughput you have bigger problems than a dinky little racial will address.
---
This is exactly what blizzard is doing
---
It's true
---
&gt;The struggle is what brings us all together.
---
Not in a quest-based themepark. Other players are literally your enemies(that you cannot attack)

And thats the beauty of Classic, taking half a year to reach 60

Thought this might add to the conversation. More relevant towards the end. [https://youtu.be/4JlGzw4l6fY](https://youtu.be/4JlGzw4l6fY)
---
Well, he even says it in the last screenshot, that he is even mean to himself. It is really sad to see people like him, especially in roles like raid/guild leading.
---
How do you expect a person to love others, if he cannot love himself. Poor soul, probably been raised like this by cruel/narcissistic parents.
---
Agree beserking isn't that helpful for priests.
---
&gt;Nothing stopping you from recasting it though should you need to and unlike shadowguard you don't lose out by downranking it. The only cost incurred is having to spend a gcd every time you refresh it. Not much reason to take blackout in any pve spec though.
---
Its a trash ability you MAX rank it if using it for the actual debuff. Other than that you don't use it.
---
&gt;This one I actually straight up disagree with. It costs a lot of mana, but that can be offset by inner focus. It is otherwise not a bad spell at all.
---
I agree that its useful with IF in pvp. Its still not great but good verse some match ups. However, it is largely bad in any BG or organized pvp. IF a mind blast for crit and free mana is what you want to do.
---
&gt;Let's say this were the case which it should be clear by now I don't believe it is, WotF is still the best racial in the game. 
---
No, its hardiness. 3 classes fear and one of those is a 3 minute CD cower (which i think is breakable in 1.12) the other is a  30 s cd (us priests) and then all the rest is just warlock.  You get to break one of these and be immune for 5 sec every 3 minutes. 1v1 vs a priest or lock this is nice and in a few pve encounters this is nice.   But hardiness helps you verses i think its 6 classes with stun, 1 race with stun, and anyone with engineering.  Its overall its not close. 
---
If WotF is the best then Fear ward is WAY better. You can have one up on 5+ people and its CD is 30s.
---
WoWHead is a financially driven project. Naturally they will try their best to become the best site for everything related to classic.
---
Other ressources like [https://legacy-wow.com/](https://legacy-wow.com/) are less financially driven (aside from covering costs or serve as advertisement) and are more of a fun-project.
---
Yup. Hunters wear it from BWL alllllll the way through ZG and AQ, into Naxx, where you still don't wanna replace it until you've got several pieces of T3 ready to go.
---
He's also responsible for whatever decision goes into classic ( such as the 16 debuff slot limit, spell batching, layering, etc. ) and going forward. Whether we get classic+ or TBC or both is up to Ion and the rest of the design team.  
---
And honestly, he is passionate about the game, he has played wow at a high-end level since vanilla with Elitist Jerks. I highly doubt he knowingly waters down the game, it's probably something coming from higher up, especially marketing, when they see the success of accesible games such as fortnite and the masses it brings. This is why everything is so flashy and MTX ridden, there's rewards for doing everything, you get to spin the wheel every week with the cache, you click a button and you're in "the game", the world isn't a living breathing world, it's a lobby.  
---
The problem isn't Ion or the degisner team, it's the higher ups that bark at the wrong trees, trying to lure in an audience that isn't interested in wow.
---
Do we know how large the install files are going to be yet?
---
As long as it doesn't make folds when you move the mouse, you're good.
---
 Played an orc warrior in WotLK. Basically burned out doing daily quests I think, can't remember exactly.  I do remember that I ran a ton of dungeons probably it was related to the daily grind? Had no interest in PvP since I had PvP:ed so much in Classic and BC and was sick of it. All in all I wasn't having fun, probably I assume it felt like I was doing a job grinding dailies which sucks. Had the same thing happen in MTG Arena, stopped playing that game a little over a week ago after almost half a year of playing daily.  Burned out on the dailies in that game. Hate when a game is "forcing you" to login each day( obviously you are not forced but you feel like you should to progress),
---
Holy priest might be the class that has the lowest DPS output while leveling. It takes for ever to kill something.
---
Because I dislike transmog, the masive amound of meningless mounts, pets and toys.
---
Its a collecters dream to always have something to farm for. But to me its all meaningles.
---
I did mythic raiding wich was fun but the AP farm each patch. The gear farm from the same dungeons each patch and the "gear reset" each patch + titanforge and the feeling of never be done has made me lose intrest.
---
I'm \*against\* it.

Realm communities thrived with a single static server. You'd know who the fancy raiding guilds were. You'd know the names and skill of PvPers you ran into or fought alongside. You'd know the douchebags who'd run away if they didn't outnumber you 3 to 1. You knew that guy that was a pain in the ass to do dungeons with because for some reason he rolls need on everything. You know the banished outcast who was known for having ninja looted the Baron's mount.
---
With layering it's whatever. Here today, gone tomorrow, except for just a handful. An anonymous world of unknown people that you don't have any need to interact with because odds are that you'll never meet again.
---
100% this isn't alliance where you are basically a traitor if you don't roll Dwarf. 
---
If you plan is casual play undead is pretty nice, If you plan of doing BG premades and going in on pvp troll is your best pick easy.
---
Also how do you know what pvp rank gets u what gear?
---
Basically they wanted the Priestess of Elune ability in the game and then had to add something for other races to make it fair.
---
* Are you for it / against it?
---
**Implementation is king, details matter. I'm against it in its current form but I don't see it as a lost cause.**
---
* What alternatives are there, and are they better, or worse?  
---
The real problems any proposed solution would have to answer are: **launch period congestion** (queues + starting zone hell) **| classic tourist effect** (possibility of a large contingent rolling Classic to check it out and dropping it leaving some servers desolate) **| game designed around 2006-like server populations**
---
1. Traditional servers + queues + merges (worse)  
---
Inflexible, possibly late response to pop drop, losing names (player + guilds)
---
2. Sharding (worse)  
---
Cross realm would be the literal death of classic. The only implementation that could be tolerated is time-limited and zone-limited but it's really hard to imagine if it is established it wouldn't be the goto solution for server pop issues. Ending up with sharding in all levels/zones is a real concern.
---
3. Server Clusters with same name pool (Alonsus-1 Alonsus-2 Alonsus-3) (worse)  
---
Inflexible, no megaserver in-game community tools (no chat/trade/guild etc), even without naming conflicts, established separate communities merging is always jarring, response would be manual and possibly late.
---
4. Layering as it stands (also bad)
---
* How could the current implementation be modified to improve its functionality?  
---
My suggestions would be the following (as a package, not an either / or proposition)  
---
1. Save the last layer any of the characters was on to the account  (prevents parking disposable alts to different layers and playing "layer  roulette" by simply re-logging)   When a character logs in, primary layering criteria  should take effect (group layer if grouped, guild layer if un-grouped  etc)   
---
Layer should be cached at the account level for the period it takes to game-disconnect when other criteria do not take precedence.
---
2. **Manual** (player initiated) layer transitions due to group invite should be **deferred**  until all group members are on the **group leader's continent** (or vice  versa) If it is possible go one step further and defer until **units are in visible range**.  
---
*There is no reason to layer a player out of their immediate  environment to a player they cannot interact with due to distance, this  will also "hide" layer transitions inside existing ship/zeppelin loading screens  making them seamless.*   
---
Combat interaction should trump everything regardless of proximity, layer transition shouldn't happen until both parties are out of combat (or dead)
---
3. **Automatic**  layer transitions due to **population re-balancing** (layerN has reached  capacity so layerN+1 is spawned and the server population is shuffled  around to keep all layers at optimal capacity) should be deferred  until Player / NPC or GameObject (chest, node, quest item etc) is over.   
---
Combat interaction should trump everything (should not be possible to layer hop until both  parties are out of combat - similar to warlock summons) but ideally including  trading/looting/mailing/interacting with merchants or AH. 
---
4. The algorithm the server runs to resolve layer assignment both on login and during the play session (manual + automatic due to re-balancing) is super important.  
---
It should work from the narrowest scope to the broadest: group|distance|continent &gt; guild &gt; friends etc.
---
For the launch rush / starting zones congestion my suggestion would be
---
1. Add level ranges to the layer assignment criteria: **1-10 | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31-40 | 41-50 | 51-60**  
---
When doing population re-balancing and layer transitions instead of doing it only on the mega-server pop census (server hit the 2006-like population cap of 3k or whatever that is set to) do instead partial census by level ranges i.e. add granularity.   
---
Layer cap / 6 level ranges = level range cap (3000/6 = 500)  
---
When the server reaches layer capacity instead of splitting to layers level-indifferent instead:  
---
\- Aggressively layer overcap level ranges (2.000 1-10 players split to separate layers)  
---
\- Shunt undercap level ranges to the same layer. (150 21-30 players shunted to the same layer)  
---
The effect will organically reverse as the server ages and population curve shifts towards the high end. New joins + alts would be shunted to a single layer while the overcap high levels would be split as needed.
---
Aren't ogres supposed to be really good at building ships?
---
&gt; "Wow, the game is so much better now", there are plenty of players out there who will think exactly that.
---
Interestingly I got a couple of mates to come play with me on a private server.  Both had played retail, hadn't liked it and had cancelled their subs after a month.  After a day or two of Vanilla, both were saying how much better the Vanilla experience was.  They enjoyed the difficultly and the challenge.  Both are now intending to play Classic.  I expect that this ^^ will be the response of most players.
---
Indeed.
---
It was a journey. I made friends, explored the world, learned a lot, made plenty of mistakes, obtained a mythril brotherhood badge, found a Destiny, grinded my ass for a level 40 mount and learned how to tank - all before even reaching max level.
---
Retail doesnt give you that :/
---
Terrible posture, no wrist support, mouse isn't even on a level surface...
---
You are hilarious. You just got shown by /u/tevagu with maths that you were totally wrong, and what I said was exactly right.
---
60 mana i thought it was like 32or 36 ? W/e
---
What do you mean by the second part of your sentence
---
Probably talking about Skullflame Shield.
---
Found the retail player who thinks you go around grouped with your entire guild at all times lmao
---
What do you mean except? You really like arguing don't you? I just said that you can compare those abilities better with each other and didn't mention which one is better.
---
And SG damage is extraordinary at higher ranks as well because it scales so well with shadow damage (close to 80%)
---
One instant shadowguard cast can: stun opponent with blackout proc (27% chance combined), increase shadowweaving stack 3 times and it deals extraordinarily well damage (you can skip casting mind flay if you grind mobs).
---
DP has heal that helps overtime. The biggest threat for spriests is that they don't have ridiculously much stamina gear so they can get bursted down. Vampiric embrace and DP work as extra healthpool.
---
I feel like for pve it doesn't really matter and pvp troll is better if you are good.
---
Part of the appeal of classic is that it's NOT polished. NOT balanced though. When they "finished" the missing zones in Cata they fucked it up universally.
---
i stopped at the end of wrath, the game and the items turned into fast no-risk reward, from the slow paced game we used to play. To just a gear trow on everyone with LFG and free epics, with instant spells and rush.
---
Are they?  Been playing WoW since launch and nice never seen an ogre ship.
---
The first class that gets booted out of the group when a Shaman is present is the Priest. If you have 7 Shamans you'll make a Druid/Priest group. AoE healing better be taken care off whenever you have 6 or more Shamans.  
---
You can put a Priest with the casters if they aren't getting a Shaman in their group but you're not putting them a Priest with Melee, that's a straight up DPS loss and we've been dicking healing output in favor for more DPS for years now.
---
&gt;now they are swallowing classic's balls
---
Just like many retail streamers who were hating on Classic since it's announcement.
---
How can it be too large? This is how it was.
---
Wife and I had our kid right when Cata dropped. I was barely playing as it was so I quit. I came back for each expansion, played a month then quit again. I stuck with Legion the longest as it felt fun in ways similar to Wrath.
---
wholesome
---
Pretty sweet. I have a buddy that uses the mouse on the arm of his couch like this. He can pvp like a mofo but I can't even fish like this.
---
Because....drumroll... in the experience of betatesters, layering isn't that much of a problem?
---

And this is from a guy who made video guides questing from 1-60
---
Hemo dagger spec?
---
You should be prompted to select layer after picking server, and then you get locked to that layer. Just like you got locked to a server in 2004.
---
Why on earth they feel the need to allow layer hopping is beyond me.
---
Layer hopping destroys immersion and immersion is the fabric of WoW. The current devs truly never played Classic or pserver it appears.
---
No, because layering is good for streamers. It makes them able to swap layers at a moment’s notice when people are ganking them or griefing the stream
---
You farm for an hour or so a week just to afford the respec or go in gangster.
---
I think a trackball would be ideal here
---
If u say so... I want to Ride a tiger as gnome and the Outlook changed from "easy by Level 45" to "Impossible early on" as they discovered Rep gains were roughly 40% reduced compared to pservers/dbs. I think the Shadowpanther Guy Tried to come Up with a leveling Route for darnassus exp.
---
No, you create an alt of the same class and run that bad boy to 60!
---
Rogue for sure
---
I am going to splitscreen level a warrior and a paladin at the same time, it is going to be glorious :)
---
10/10
---
Berserking is quite fun with improved mana burn. Overall it's a niche ability that can be used in variety of ways
---
I wouldn’t take Dal’Rend’s as a hunter, unless every melee has them. Lok’Delar is super fun and fairly manageable to get, plus there’s next to no competition for it.
---
I like it, surely helps with neck pain
---
Oh shit that's awesome, thanks!
---
&gt;Don’t think he mentioned anything about questing in a raid group.
---
My bad I didn't realize this would be so complicated for some of you. People don't just have a single clump of 5 friends, where nobody in that group has any other friends. Each of those 5 friends is gonna have a few other friends of their own. Unless you're in a raid, you're going to have to choose which friends you want to see in the world.
---
&gt;If you dislike competing with other players then surely you are in favour of layering?
---
Do you not understand what layering is? It's not about not having 500 people in Northshire. Each layer is still a full server. But I'll take the bait, because I'm actually _in favor_ of layering. It just needs some fixes.
---
I don't see it like that at all. I think lvling is part of the journey and not just a race. Even if I've done the same q's a dussin times it's the player encounters that make each run unique. The bad ones and the good.
---
And if questing is just smooth sailing there is absolutely no need to group with randos.
---
Pandaria *cough*
---
So you need to type that in the console instead of clicking through the options? Is that a thing?
---
this is how i imagine wow players look like

It's 400ms, although that means on average you'll experience 200ms of delay.
---
But yes most of the issues that people cry hardest about has nothing to do with spell batching. I think in some cases it also has to do with aura update rates, which are separate from spell batching. It's like how you can run out of Consecration but the aura debuff only fades after ~2 seconds. I'm sure they messed up somewhere there and are applying the aura in the same interval or something, where as AFAIK only the removal is meant to be on such a long delay (referred to as aura stickiness, something present even in WC3).
---
Either way, when people refer to spell batching, they just mean the simultaneous triggering of abilities, which IMO is good. It adds interesting interactions and room for people with excellent anticipation to shine. Being able to run through traps is not OK and I really don't like how people seem intent on burning spell batching in the process, when I'm certain the two aren't related.
---
There are streamer fanboys who go to insane lengths to interact with them and there are streamer haters that would go to even greater lengths (from what I've seen) to ruin their experience.  
---
Don't underestimate the power of spite.
---
They're both an evil, but one of them is a necessary evil and merging is the lesser evil.
---
It's not that bad. Hamstring kiting while you wait on your auto timer mitigates a lot of unnecessary damage. Also once you get Sweeping Strikes + Cleave have fun blowing up 2 targets at once every 30 seconds.
---
Well it's about alternative cost, making classic + would cost more and is not a guaranteed success, releasing TBC would guarantee them another 2 years of cashing in on old wow.
---
You get that the entire system is totally different right? It doesn't matter what data they have, its a new system running it. Now they are adapting it But who wants to bet you can no longer jump in the same areas of WSG that you could in vanilla etc. 
---
&gt;If something works X way on that 1.12 server, they make it work that way in the modern client.
---
No, thisn't isn't the way it works. I mean i think they are going to attempt to emulate some aspect of 1.12 but they will also be faking it. They are difference system you much of it isn't a simple plug and play process.
---
&gt; Unless you're in a raid, you're going to have to choose which friends you want to see in the world.
---
Given your charm, I'd say that's a little optimistic.
---
Mybe they're just releasing it to tell us "here you go, classic servers." and then just leave them to rot so they can say that they tried?
---
Layering isn't the "conservative" approach, it's the "We're confident our guess will be correct" approach... almost the exact opposite of conservative. Conservative would be mirror servers that may or may not be merged as it's the non-judgemental, "we really have no idea what the population will do, so lets play it safe" path to take.
---
...Other than that I like your post.
---
It is by an incredible stroke of luck that we're getting Classic at all.  Some corporate big wig at Activision must have had a really good cup of coffee that morning the decision was made.  I fully expect Classic to totally surprise Blizzard with its success, they not understand why, then completely fuck it all up in a year or two.  The company utterly lacks vision and is so disconnected from the fanbase that they were honestly surprised by the disaster of Blizzcon 2018.  Lads, we must really enjoy this first year of Classic, before Blizzard screws it all up.
---
I'd consider sitting on totems during a duel so one of the participants can't destroy them griefing.
---
I want to add to the pros of WotLK:
---
Other than the OP hero class, the class and spec balance achieved an almost perfect state in 3.2 and early 3.3, in both PvE and PvP. Very few specs are completely useless or outright outclassed (for example, Enhanced Shamans are almost entirely outclassed by Frost DK, but that's hero class for you), and they are still playable even when outclassed.
---
These two are also before the Cataclysm, when class identity is truly gone and comes spec identity.
---
Compared to TBC, when some specs, especially DPS specs of hybrid classes still scale poorly into the later stages of the game. (and most of those specs are outright useless in classic)
---
I played from the open beta for vanilla through the first raiding tier in Cata. Came back when MoP launched, hit max level and then did one LFR before unsubbing.  Did the exact same thing for WoD.  Legion launched and I played that for about 4 hours total before quitting for good.
---
The game just felt soulless to me.  Every class could do everything, the gear was all homogenized and brought absolutely no excitement, the community was completely non existent, etc.  
---
For me, the Tier 9 patch in the middle of WotLK that introduced random dungeon finder was the beginning of the end of WoW for me.  The implementation of LFR at the end of Cata was the official death of the game for me.  I kept trying to rekindle my love for the game, but it was basically just a walking corpse that only resembles the game I loved for so many years on the very surface.
---
Garrisons is when I quit.
---
Yeah, guess I'm wrong then.
---
Still, I'll probably be going for my setup as it allows me to pass on mantle of the blackwing cabal to the warlocks and shadow priest, as they don't have any other good options.
---
"Vanilla private servers has gone very good." I'd like to see some data proving that said private servers had 100k concurrent players online at one point in time. 
---
I think this subreddit is seriously stuck in another time, over-hyping a game that doesn't have grip on new generations and will most likely come back only a portion of the original player-base. 
---
"BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GET TO EXPERIENCE VANILLA WILL DO IT THIS TIME". Yeah sure, they will balance out those that have quit the addiction.
---
I don't know. I quite fear empty servers expecially when we keep asking to split them (all the RP-pvp and the language related servers drama).
---
Honestly, I'd love to know how many people are vehemently against it and also played for the Vanilla release.
---
I did play vanilla release. I played a lot that day and those first few days. I also was on what I understand to be one of the servers with the most active communities (judging purely based on Arthas was awesome and Faces of WoW numbers). The first few days were a shit show, and while I had a ton of fun, it was still a shit show and I probably would have had a lot less fun if I wasn't a university student on Thanksgiving break. 
---
I'm pretty opposed to long term layering, but I really couldn't care less if it lasts a few weeks and I'd be slightly miffed but not much worse than that if it ends up being a month or two.
---
I know the arguments against it, but at low levels it bothers me a whole hell of a lot less than hour plus server queues and having to do forced server merges.
---
I could be wrong. Maybe there are a ton of people who played on the first few days of release who hate it. I do wonder though.
---
Can you explain why this is the case please?
---
quit after clearing toc hardmode in wotlk. didn't like the way the game was going.
---
since, though, classic wow turned my head too much so i started a char on a pserver and have done up to sapphiron on it.
---
Well the thing is you can call people out and even kick people without toxic (bad) leadership. You can create an atmosphere of high accountability without being a dick if the guild/raid leader actually has some leadership skills. 
---
Although most of the quotes in the post were probably said in gest I feel like this type of guild will be a total waste of my time because I'm an adult and I don't need to be yelled at to be motivated to improve.
---
Death to all nightelfs
---
Get yourself a lapdesk.
---
Nothing is known unless they Publicize it. Even If u nail the Server Numbers your math May be way Off.
---
Realmcensus addons Show na+eu at 900k chars online, now estimating Asia is another ~600k. Thats 1,5mil unique chars online per month. Im Quote certain the subcount is below 1mil rn
---
Blizz has More Numbers available than WE have. They know how many clicks Classic generate, how many people subbed after Beta announcement, how many people opted in for Beta etc. Just taking 800k nost Accounts +20% Sounds Like Something a 13year old would come Up with, No offense. Blizz is a Business and they have a whole Department for Market Analysis to determine that Server Count. Thats why im    reluctant on saying that theyre underestimate Classics playerbase. I think they have a far better estimate than all of US combined.
---
In the Second we're on this Reddit we're biased. We're socializing with Other Enthusiasts and slowly begin to feel Like the whole world is waiting for Classic.
---
Good job proving you really, really didn't understand a single thing. 
---
I'll be the bigger man and ignore the not so subtle insult, because I really don't give a fuck what someone who doesn't even understand something this simple thinks, so I'll just try to make this even simpler, hopefully it gets through some of the thicker skulled people here:
---
#It's not about a single person having 40 friends.
---
Yeah but those are expensive as hell.
---
Possibly!
---
I would actually prefer it to be longer too so that I can no life farm honor in the winter AFTER christmas
---
I think there is going to be aloot of crashes during launch, im not trying to be negative. Its just that if their estimate is wrong and even more people show up for launch (which i think is possible) and going by the pacing of classic i believe aloot more people will stick around to explore the game. Going by my estimates IF i am correct, Blizzard just feels unprepared IMO :)
---
Maybe irrelevant to the topic, but will you be able to play both BfA and Classic with the same subscription? Or are they separate?
---
Why do fire-places look soo odd without a mantle?
---
Garrisons.
---
That seems perfect, I can’t think of much more I’d add really, and having stuff be selectable would be awesome. If I want a guild that doesn’t require world buffs I can just uncheck the box when searching etc...
---
I agree. This could be the change of pace some of them need. Something to grind and strive for. Who knows.... I’ll be a classic fiend
---
Are Druids really that bad healers in Classic? If so, I'll play Rogue instead :(
---
I have a horrible feeling that Blizzard are underestimating the number of servers, but hope they'll have time to rethink after signups on the 13th.
---
I mean, were you levelling as prot? Arms tanks just as well as prot until like level 40-50 and you can actually deal some damage. I'm levelling one on a private server right now (48) and it's been surprisingly fine the entire time.
---
Surprised this didn't get hit with a rule 7 tbh..
---
Played vanilla did some raids but had issues with sub (was a kid with no real allowance), TBC didnt raid, same issues with sub, heavily raided in wrath (I had income of my own), abd did the first raids in cata and burned out.
---
Skipped mists, tried WOD for a week and left, tried legion for DH, and now foolin around in BFA waiting for classic.
---
Wotlk.
---
We raided uldaman for the gear and then blizzard gave the gear to everyone for free. 
---
Was like blizzard gave me the middle finger, so I returned the favor and never looked back.
---
Jesus, you're so right. Why are they all melee?
---
Oh, thanks a lot!
---
This website would greatly benefit if in order to downvote, you had to reply to the post.
---
I like the idea of playing the smaller tribes as we run into them through the storyline. But they fucked that up with putting them behind a rep well.
---
It is valid if topping healing meters is important for you. But it is not a good way of playing, it would benefit raid more if you spent the mana smiting instead of being inefficient. 
---
If you go down the route of Flash heal spamming, be aware that it changes what is actually bis items for this kind of play (all bis lists are calculated from non stop spamming of heal rank 2).
---
Lmao this is a wild ride of a thread.
---
Guilds should stay in the same layer, i am sure they said this in a talk so the guild will always see eachother.
---
&gt; they're in it for enchanting materials
---
you won't ever be disenchanting valuable items such as BoE epics. point moot.
---
&gt; they're better at selling items than you
---
what is so hard to understand about "price this item currently goes for".
---
&gt; Your plan is fucking stupid
---
lashing out cause you can't really name a valid flaw in it. talk about triggered. you do you
---
I played Druid in TBC and beyond and loved it but everyone is telling me it's shit for healing in classic :( So I'm tempted to roll hunter or rogue like I did before.
---
yeah noooo
---
Right?
---
Honestly, who could *not* want to crowd all these shining personalities together?
---
If they're at all unsure on their launch day estimates they easily can test them by tacking on one or two weeks of "open beta" (open to all active subs) between the last stress test and early access name reservations. Based on the June stress test it doesn't appear that any tidal wave of resubs was drawn in by the prospect of just three days of testing. But a week or two of full beta likely would tempt most of the interested stand offs to re-up a month early to check it out, and it would also give a good indication how many retail tourists bored of 8.2 already are likely to check in and look around.
---
It would not be 100% of everyone who shows up for the actual launch, but it would give them an accurate indicator of whether their estimates need to be significantly revised. Even if they get many more than they expected, it's unlikely they'll need to make massive server list changes unless they were off by an order of magnitude. And given how long they've been at this, it's unlikely that the people responsible are going to be way off on their numbers. If there is one thing they're good at, it's putting numbers to everything that they do. And they've gotten much better in recent years at tuning launch day services to projected numbers.
---
That doesn't mean things won't go wrong. Things will go wrong as they always do. But the things that go wrong will not be because they grossly over or understimated interest in the product on launch day. They know better than anyone how to accurately project that, and they certainly have.
---
If you don’t like loot reserving groups, then don’t join them.  Pretty simple, yeah?
---
What does posting about it here accomplish for you exactly?
---
Yeees keep spreading this stuff, I want my tier sets for myself...
---
It's how they solve the issue of friends wanting to play together but being on different layers. So really it's a fix to a symptom of one of the absolute dumbest decisions to ever have been made by Blizzard.
---
You could group first then disband, that should keep you all on the same layer. It def works in beta but I'm sure there will be many more layers in classic.
---
Honestly, I hope there will be a dual spec option, the game was often fundamentally flawed, not everyone is a vanilla diehard. 
---
I'm even hoping that they start polling or making balance changes to classes/the game, quite frankly, some classes were just OP or completely broken.. Lets just talk tanks for now: how dumb and gated is it that there is only one "viable" tank class, even though there are 3 tank classes. Game will die if there are no content/balance patches, and I'm really hoping they do something similar to 2007scape has done (i know 2007scape is much easier on the devs to implement changes, but one can hope it would work). Next closest thing would be Vanilla - BC - Wrath, which imo would work. 
---
Well anyway, im rolling tank druid, dont wanna support the 20-25% warrior horde which is inevitable with this balance..
---
Roll Undead, then. They have more Shadow Resist (good for Twin Emps) and Will of the Forsaken is more valuable in PvE than Stun Resist. Also Cannibalize is nice while leveling.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, but since I will be on a PvP server and want to play a little bit of PvP, too, I am still undecided.
---
trolls get haste racials for renews and faster heals but i dont know how much of an effect it will have in classic  
---
 Berserking: Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 25%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 25% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec. 3 min cooldown 
---
 ... the undead racial spell is a dps 
---
Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 152 Shadow damage over 24 seconds. Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster. 3 minute cooldown.
---
one i think and troll is a hex of weakness with a mortal strike type of thing (useful for pvp?)   
---
Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 2 and reduces effectiveness of healing spells by 20% for 2 minutes   
---
The undead can eat to regen and their racial is   
---
Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 152 Shadow damage over 24 seconds. Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster. 3 minute cooldown.  
---
This seems to be a solo type of ability as classic had a debuff limit on a boss/mob   
---
Undead will of the forsaken can be useful for both pvp and pve to get some healing out:

Will of the Forsaken: Provides immunity to [Charm](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Charm), [Fear](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fear) and [Sleep](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Sleep) while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec. 2 min cooldown.
---
Haha no kidding! 
---
You got me there lol. However, if you watch the video he references, it is about dual wielding. The person is using Thunderfury and in all Naxx gear. 
---
You almost got me though.
---
&gt; And don't think they've changed their beliefs in those 3 years either. That's not how people work.
---
Lol, people change their minds about things all the time when they've realized they were wrong.  It's called growing up.
---
Like many other people, I played the holy trinity (vanilla-tbc-wotlk) and then quit. Can't wait for classic!
---
Touristed cata and legion but quit again a few months in. Actually tried BfA (because legion was decent) and quit after just a few days lol.
---
&gt; Layering is ok for MMO
---
Anything that splits up the playerbase of an MMO is antithetical to MMOs.
---
This. Exactly this until layering is gone.
---
One does not simply quit wow. One take breaks;)
---
Aren't you grasping at straws now? The answer to your linked post immediately states, that the person who made the claim didn't revoke it, but merely stated, he had no idea whether it's right or not.
---
You seem to be completely tunnel visioned on that one reddit post, that you even ignore counter arguments brought in the very same thread. 
---
How do I not understand how search engines work? It seems to me, you are the one who doesn't. I explained it right before this post, yet you seem to ignore this completely and just rely on the holy words of aphoenix.
---
I've been doing green quests since Westfall on a PS. So much less dying, pace has felt reasonable to 50.
---
Estimates based on assumptions about estimates that you assume are based on certain assumptions. Nice, seems very legit.
---
I mean, Might be your numbers are right. But as an analysis it's on shaky grounds I'd say.
---
Care to translate that first sentence?
---
and i was thinking of taking up WoW again once classic is out - but thanks!!! seeing who i might spend my time with cured me - no offense!
---
Retail is also the classic IP.
---
Honestly, I had no idea it was an offensive word. Thought it mean idiot or someone with disregard for others.
---
Wait, that idea is so simple it might just work!
---
I agree for mmo slow leveling and even raiding to be honest. I played vanilla on a laptop and didn’t do my first build on a desktop till my first year of college when I came home. Desktop for games like csgo league or some pvp, but the old casual recline or even laying in bed finishing up something grindy before going to is nice.
---
You don't lose identity.  We know this from experience.
---
You two are wrong
---
You will never know until we try it though. So i will still send it eventually.
---
And with layering you will have the same experience after a few weeks when it's gone. You people keep acting like layering will be forever.
---
I'm for it, for the first 4 weeks and the first 30 levels only.
---
I'm against it for anything above lvl 30 and regardless of lvl after 4 weeks period (even starting zones).
---
Please make sure there is a random internal cooldown to stop layer hopping abuse.
---
And no, I don't think there are any better alternatives.
---
I suffer from chronic pain that has ruined my life because i spent so much time in positions like that with bad posture.
---
Rethink this.
---
Very few left old-school enough to call it a push.
---
Not true my casual friends and I could do the run in 45m for our D 1.5 sets.  And this was my wife who got 4 fps my friend who clicked and keyboard turned and never could make the Wailing Caverns jump, another friend who tried to be a melee hunter.
---
Honestly it's not that bad. Sure it's worse than other classes, but it's far from what people are making it to be. Pull too many mobs by accident? Kite them back and just kill one of them while rest reset. You don't need to just stand there and take a beating ;)
---
Yes, model editing is bannable.  Whether or not it’s enforced stringently and you actually end up getting banned is up for debate.  I prefer the updated models as well.  Not going to use them tho as it’s not worth risking my account for them.  Really wish they’d just add them as a toggle option.
---
so all "blizzard estimates" are basically your estimates you pulled out your ass?
---
i mean nice write-up but without any credible source on any numbers its pointless and can be bent to any conclusion you desire.
---
I am by NO means an expert on paladins, but I have seen plenty of people mentioning that you can basically get the mandatory healing talents with 20 points in holy - which, if you care more about your solo ability than being the best possible healer for your raid, allows 31 points to put in e.g. Ret.
---
Not claiming that this is optimal in any way, but if you're gonna have a much better time that way, and your guild doesn't mind (they'd want the improved might anyways) - it might be right for you.   
---
I know I will spend quite a lot of my time as a "resto" druid with 30 points in feral - for my own enjoyment's sake. 
---
Found this quote from u/LiterallyMrRogers:
---
*I'm nearly finished making a comprehensive paladin healing spreadsheet so here's a mathematical answer:*
---
*In pre-raid BiS a standard full holy spec paladin, using all relevant consumables except demonic runes and without being world buffed, can spam max rank flash of light for 72% of a 6 minute fight and does about 161.4k total raw healing during the fight. Without divine favor and 5% extra crit they can use it for 68% of the fight and their raw healing drops to 148.6k. In this case whether or not the paladin actually will be required to finish their heals often enough to make this matter is questionable.*
---
*Basically if mana is an issue a paladin gets a bit less than 10% extra total healing from those talents. If mana isn't an issue then it's worth less than 2.5% extra healing due to the extra healing from crits, which is often overheal.*
---
Available in an entirely different phase, and even without progressive tables leaf would be post raid.
---
At no point is the staff competing with the rend set.
---
So basically whenever everyone disagrees with me on something, I’ll just take a deep breath and think to myself: you are correct - and I’ll immediately be correct. Thanks for the advice. /s
---
He means the actual newer models, not just old models but with everything cranked to max. You can already do that in-game.
---
weapon skill is such a great stat. Human rogues are OP in pve
---
Go to wowhead wardrobe and equip a troll and undead in your ideal gear. Pick the one who looks cooler
---
Started in vanilla, never got to 60 and had a break, restarted in TBC cleared mostly up to Hyjal &amp; early BT and burned out. Restarted again in WotLK, quit just before ICC patch. Reasons were mostly real life combined with a bit of TOC. TOC really got to my nerves, first we had the best raid ever, Ulduar. Then we get TOC which was the worst raid ever, and it invalidated all of Ulduar. So there I was, doing the 4 or 5 or however many there were Loot Pinatas in the most uninspired raid. And I just couldn't see the point anymore.
---
But mostly it was really real life. It was supposed to be a break too, I was planning to come back during ICC or Cata, but never did. I had other stuff to do and time went on and getting back into the game seemed harder and harder and eventually I stopped even thinking about getting back to it. Until now.
---
This little muffin got triggered. I guess we found one of the people that put themselves through hell for +2% crit. It's not worth it. Look at the toll it has taken on your mind.
---
Respectfully, I'm saying that you can't tell a book by it's cover and a website would only provide a catalog of insincere responses to ineffective questions.
---
There's no getting around the fact that you have to group with players, see how they interact with others and do so without them being at their artificial best. This isn't something that's possible through asking questions on a website.
---
Or preraid in the form of Blackcrow.
---
Eh, you're wrong. If the PVP related discrepancies are present across every realm and not just PVP realms (which doesn't necessarily *will* be a case but most definitely *can* be a case) then a single realm will not be able to support its own queues for Horde players meaning despite sharing player pools overall queue times for Horde could be longer than Alliance queues.
---
To be fair I'll be playing Horde myself, I'm not PVP oriented but I definitely will do BGs from time to time and I expect somewhat long queues.
---
There's nothing preventing a dw tank from slapping on a shield and pressing shield block whenever he has a significant threat lead, or when he's in danger of dying. Very few bosses will be unpredictable in damage taken, and if you're full health there's no reason to have a shield on, as no boss will be able to one or two shot you even with crushing blows, assuming the tank is decently well geared compared to the raid he's in, which he will be when dw tanking is relevant.
---
Being a shareholder looks boring as f\*\*k...  
---
These guys clearly never played Classic Wow.
---
I prefer Classic Wow, such fun!
---
I already did that when the option became available. Maybe it's only downloadable for a certain % of people at a time and increased periodically.
---
Layering is needed and idiots like you don't understand that classic numbers will start high and get lower..... Instead of gaining in numbers over time. Layering is better than realm merges when most realms are dead a few months in.
---
If crushing blows are the end of tanks so that means druids cant tank?
---
Ofc thats not true, because crushing blows and crits arent the end of the world. More parry % on bosses just means u need more gear than previously thought to start DW on some bosses.
---
Email!?! In World of Warcraft? That's absurd :)
---
So why not focus on the real bis and go Orc rogue, they are the only race on the horde side with closed toe shoes. And the 25% stun resist way out weighs fear break because there are hardly any warlocks on the alliance side anyways.
---
I've put so much time and effort into making this work for myself. It just isn't ideal I'm my experience. Can't play for very long without getting muscle cramps and sore tendons in my hands. Can't read quest text, or any text. Squinting constantly. Constantly searching for a new position. I've even tried configuring a steam controller and leaning forward.
---
I searched for add-ons that increase text don't size, controller configuration. It was never quite natural. There was always a handicap.
---
Lol what? Priest and Druid fucking smoke Warrior in leveling speed. And Rogue probably too because he isn't dead 7 times an hour.
---
Flying was added in TBC m8
---
30min? lmao are you jelly that you cant get 4 other friends to do this? why are u so butthurt about it, if you believe its worse then solo lvling why come here and complain? You are obviously going to be server first anyway
---
"If I can upgrade my bracers with +3 agi, and let's see.... my boots can definitely be upgraded. Oh and that weapon I've had for 6 levels can be upgraded. Might as well get my new weapon enchanted as well! I'll be grinding mobs so much faster!"
---
During the Beta tournament i think there was a Hunter that scatter-shot a rogue who was opening from stealth is that because of spell batching?
---
Why would you ever level as Holy? Shadow is so good and efficient when you play correctly.
---
You and I both!
---
I really don't get the wanting newer models thing. I could be wrong here, but didn't they only update the *character* models, not every single piece of vanilla armor..? So 90% of what you see of your character will be SD with a HD head and will look ridiculous?
---
Get you and your friends to move
---
Im sorry dont understand, you mean its already implemented? All new models from legion or draenor, graphics and all?
---
He had good thumbnails lol
---
I stopped playing somewhere in TBC. 
---
1. I didn't like flying mounts. It ruined the world and world pvp for me. 
---
2. I didn't like daily quests.
---
Will of the Forsaken is awesome for PvP but unless that's the majority of your time, I'd go with troll rogue
---
The best friends are those that we do not see.
---
I love how they try and turn everything into a debate. “No Ben this is not a debate, you are not entitled to an argument simply by having an opinion.” 
---
Also they pretend like people can’t read between the lines while they remain “civil”.

**About us**: We are a rather young guild, formed only a few months ago with currently close to 150 members, consisting mostly of experienced vanilla veterans and/or """unofficial""" classic server players.
---
We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
Non-raiders, casuals and socials are very welcome to join us as well, as we're trying to build a big community rather than just a raid roster.
---

**What we can offer:**
---
- active and well designed discord server
---
- organized guild bank
---
- spreadsheets for professions, rosters, etc.
---
- helpful &amp; experienced class leaders

_________
---
**PvE**: We expect to have a raid ready roster of ***atleast*** 40 people within about 2 months after launch and clear Molten Core before Phase 2 starts. 
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we still want to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and premade battlegrounds later on. If theres a high demand we will do even more PvP stuff, like city raids and duel tournaments.

**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1).

We still need a warlock and a mage class leader though so we're currently looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. Class leaders will also be part of the loot councils and recruit more members of their class if needed.

If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!

---
I'd take it over layering/sharding
---
No. You guessed the server numbers which you admit is an estimation.
---
Even using the word estimation for that is really stretching the boundaries of the word since you have absolutely no solid data so it's really more accurate to say you pulled it from the ether than you estimated it.
---
Even assuming those numbers are coincidentally correct, the following applications you do like saying "if this is the case then 50% dropout rate" is also pulled out of the ether. So it's absolutely not necessarily on point.
---
Why isn’t layering just an option for the player?
---
Honestly i would take layering over hour long queues on launch day but we can only hope that the tourist traffic dies in fast so they can remove it faster
---
Well i honestly doubt anyone gonna get banned for using different models, I know im gonna try my luck just cant stand such old graphics and I love the game..
---
I also dont understand why they dont give people an option, I mean they already have all those models made!
---
i think it depends on frequency than level
---
if it makes you feel any better you wont be farmed for honor, since honor wont be in until phase 2
---
Totally unrelated but the best way to proof read and spell check a paper your writing. Just post it on reddit. People will fall over themselves to show your an idiot by correcting your spelling and grammar
---
No matter how excited I am for classic, they had ground to stand on with statements like this.  Reverting back to classic is like ford rebuilding a top selling truck from 15 years ago... Yah the world loved the truck 15 years ago, but when there is competition like now, rebuilding the truck just won't match industry standards.  I can't wait for classic because I like the idea of a clean fresh start. But I understand why they are skeptical
---
I played all expansions except for MoP. Vanilla was the only one i played till the very end. Never played an expansion more than 6 months
---
I'm not against layering in the slightest, like I said above, I believe it solves a lot problems associated with release.  However, I also believe these videos ***demonstrate*** the potential for abuse, and adverse affects to gameplay. This needs to be monitored.
---
Blizzard's change involving switching layers and an internal cooldown is a change that could be good or bad. The good is it more or less solves the problems like gurubashi and thorium veins. Say hypothetically my friend and I are on layer cooldown, but in separate layers, are we not able to group?  
---
&gt; layering on beta IS NOT even a slightly good reference. 
---
&gt; Since they tested it there, nothing with layering on the beta was final and it was manually fiddled with. 
---
Yes, beta is not the best place to observe this, but its the only way to test it at the moment. This being said, Blizzard isn't very communicative about what is happening with layering (as they have been with other bugs on the Beta). This lack of communication on an issue that is so divisive is worrying, to me at least, since layering is one of the largest fundamental differences between Vanilla and Classic.
---
What about the orgrimmar green skins?
---
Well that response changes your initial statement greatly. See, you replied to OP's question with a very simple statement making it seem like you believe that no seasonal events will be brought into classic at all. Your response to my inquiry cleared up this confusion. Only one last thing to clear up. I was not the person that said anything about Brewfest.  
---
Yeah I meant Thaddius , I would jump doing the heigen dance though so got confused .
---
Fair enough. Thanks for your time to reply though
---
On Nostalrius, the average time to 60 was apparently 10 days 17 hours /played. That's well over 200 hours.
---

---
English is not my native language, please excuse any mistakes.
---
Maybe you are right, but the Classic community seems to be a lot more active, engaged and enthusiast that the retail one.
---
Like you said, people who are bored with Classic will stop playing Classic after a few weeks / months, but it seems that a lot of people who are playing retail and are complaying about everything are, in spite, actually staying and pays their monthly subs since years.
---
This can only make the "Classic aura" more positive with players who are enthusiast and happy with their game.
---
You can compare the mood and the theme discussed on r/wow and r/classicwow. And if the community stay strong and engaged, this can only be better for the future.
---
Just my thoughts exactly - I'm stuck with Tauren because well.. who wants to be good at anything, when they can be kinda meh at everything... Dang I'm gonna miss my raptor.
---
2.8 isn't exactly crazy slow. I suspect that there are better options. Pretty sure as early as the STV grand hunt quest chain you'll get better, and likely before that.
---
Yeah I thought the same thing, but since it’s been so long I’m cool with letting new and returning players claim their “firsts” for this re-release. I think it adds some excitement and fun
---
Sorry but this is absolutely incorrect. Shaman and priest are quite fast, and say "resto is slow", you said these classes are slow, not specific builds.  Warrior is objectively slower then all of them, possibly on par paladin.  If you take just as long to level a shaman or priest as I warrior, you are not playing these classes even close to optimally.
---
The world and story stopped feeling interesting to me
---
Blizz writing nowadays is fuckin' abysmal!
---
Mhm... For me posture and shooting animations are quite important too. Guessing female orc/troll is closest to human (the troll kinda wobbles though)
---
I use a lazy boy as well, OP is right. It’s extremely comfortable.
---
But like I just said, every character will be wearing SD armor which covers 90% of their body. What do you look at most of the time while you're playing..?
---
I played and quit every expansion, even your precious TBC.  Vanilla is the only version of Wow that kept my interest indefinitely.
---
This is true, I always had a mixture of T2 and Rank 12/13 (?) gear. I'll definitely check out the link, thanks!
---
If the class you play can be a troll, then you're a troll. They look way cool! Also, that racial is pretty cool for healing. AND as mentioned shadowguard in combination with blackout is actually pretty cool.   
---
In my experience I see more undead priests, so you'd feel more special too ;)
---
Why are paladins always brought up as slow levellers? They deal good damage, they have nearly no downtime due to good mana regen and heals. They get a minor speed boost in their early 20s and a free mount at level 40. They are very impervious to bad pulls, as a paladin can pretty easily handle 3 mobs at the same time.
---
I just don't see where the slow levelling stigma comes from, even if they did do poor damage, which simply isn't the case until the high levels.
---
Thunderfury on a hunter... yeah... I'm rolling horde so dwarf is out of the picture. I do like Tauren though, considering going female though because you see a lot less of those around
---
OP! 
---
I play with a lazy boy as well! 
---
55” TV for me but I have a 32” wall mounted above it as my second screen.
---
Too bad they're only seeing the light now. 
---
Those who voiced their concerns initially were downvoted to oblivion because 'The devs know best' 'it's only for 2 weeks' etc.
---
Yes the starter zones will be crowded but they were crowded 14 years ago and the game was still a success. 
---
They're doing a great job implemented 1.12 as it was unchanged (bugs and all) but then go against all of that and add layering?!
---
Fair enough.
---
Gun animation is pretty cool too, bow is a bit too gangster for me
---
mmmhmm... 
---
Queue Pandaran fanboi: "Ackshually, there was a Pandaran in Warcraft 3."
---
ED has no sharding?
---
Yeah, right, model graphics are improved compared to vanilla but there are no "new" models.
---
But you ain't got no desk, Lieutenant Dan.
---
If by 'fix' you mean remove, then yes there is enough time.
---
I just don't see where the slow levelling stigma comes from, even if they did do poor damage, which simply isn't the case until the high levels, the perks of free mount and no downtime would make them decent enough.
---
Orc is the only choice there are only 3 classes you need to worry about with fears, where as you need to worry about all of the classes but warlock can have a stun through talents. Granted some are just proc based stuns like Ignite, Improved Conc shot or Blackout. But aside from that there are a lot more stuns in PvP than there are stuns. So Undead are not a better race than Orcs. 
---
PS. Orcs also get closed toes shoes.
---
Overall for pvp, i would say mages
---
I played Tauren Hunter in Vanilla and loved it.  Currently pissing about with a Troll Hunter on PS, and I still reactively look for Warstomp when I get aggro, only to realise I dont have it anymore!
---
Only thing that bother me now is that I know that Troll/Orc are objectively better choices, partly because of racials, but also because of starting stats.  Then again, it is only a small difference, a percentage point or two at most. Think I will probably roll Troll on Classic, but the call of the Tauren is strong! Moooooooooooooo!
---
Honestly not having silence in pvp is fine. PI spec. is beast for pvp. 
---
I personally really like tri-spec, but mostly because it's a totally unique spec. that plays completely different from most healers.
---
I will also be running a PI spec. with an elemental shaman friend quite often.
---
I am pretty sure it is forbidden to change models with a software.There is a reason why T-morph is forbidden.
---
This is a great reply, orc shooting animations are indeed one (if not the) of the best!
---
Have fun my dude
---
And now he dies because he got vanish/sprint/blind on cooldown and the base gets back capped.
---
They've had nothing but plummetting subscriber numbers after every expansion launch since Cataclysm. With the turnover rate Blizzard has, I imagine everyone on the team has been 'conditioned' to think that.
---

Blood Fury only increased *melee* attack power by it's *base* amount. Only usable by Rogues, DPS Warriors and Enhancement Shamans. And even they wouldn't bother using it most of the time because of the 25 second Mortal Strike debuff you apply to yourself, which is suicide in many situations.
---
Easily the worst on use racial in Classic. But you're not rolling Orc for Blood Bury...you're doing it for the Hardiness stun resist.
---
Loot trading was never a thing in vanilla = not listening. 
---
Content plan is fine. But ignoring the debuff limit will destroy a part of raiding in MC, onyxia and BWL. = semi listening I gues? 
---
European servers = semi listening, still missing spanish language and probably others aswell
---
Oceanic = Dont know. 
---
If they took out Layering. They would do the right thing and be true to their own game. Saying 80% will quit is a bad guess and they have nothing to hold it up against. Why 80? Why not 90 why not 50. 
---
 What if they are wrong and more will join? 
---
Cripling the game is a part of the experience in the very start. We are writing 2019, server issues shouldnt be a problem anymore. 
---
I was a part of 2005 vanilla launch and I dont remember to have all these problems. Maybe because I got ahead of the curve in orc/troll starting zone. But i dont mind have to fight for my mobs in starting zones, thats a part of the core experience of a brand new server
---
They should be marketing this... with a trailer, its own section in bnet, etc
---
But meh, they never learn.
---
I guess the entire crux of the argument bases around whether or not a guild is going to let him raid with a shitty spec.
---
To be honest, he can probably find one. There will be guilds that pride themselves on including "bad" specs in their raids.
---
99% of player encounters consist of ignoring each other. I get it if you want to be on an RP server, but other than that you're playing "against" everyone you're not grouped with. You camp each other's mobs, you take resources, you take quest items, etc.
---
I really hate the memes infestation here but that one made me laugh :&lt;
---
They can’t do that because it would kill the other servers.
---
It reminds me of Dynamic Queue in League. They go against the wants if their players because ‘they know better’.
---
Don't forget to use "equip item appearance set" to save yourself a lot of time.
---
The best part of classic was seeing the level 60 warrior who killed you the week before in full tier 2 in hillsbrad and knowing exactly who it was.
---
Layering ruins the immersion of classic and I’m not even excited to try it again.
---
Running around empty zones with w people you’ve never seen before and won’t see again is not fun.
---
I Thought it was better to get some rep with homefaction in the early levels for the mount discount. I don't know for sure if anyone will have the time to reach 12 before the weekend tho. That's why I'm interrested in gathering all the options we have.
---
you and your friends would choose the same layer. JUST like you and your friends chose the same server in 2004.
---
It's the exact same scenario as 2004.
---
will we get 30s cc in pvp?! =D
---
Sounds amazing lol!
---
Take a trip back to that innocent time in life when your best friend stopped talking to you for 9 months because you liked the changes to Power Word: Shield.

By the time most people are in end-game layering will be long gone. People are acting like layers are permanent divisions.
---
Why wouldnt lionheart helm be available?
---
Molten core is p1.
---
I’ll be maining paladin when it comes to my group, and after thinking about it for some time, I’ve decided that I want my solo character to be whatever will be able to make the most money.  So, which class/race combo for alliance has the greatest money making potential in solo play?
---
Oh you spent months coordinating and clearing the hardest content in the game. Well billy over here did a few world quests and used his mana pearls on his benthic gear and now it’s better than yours!
---
This is such a terrible attitude to be honest. If you dont respect the guild enough to show up with a proper spec, why should anyone else?
---
You will just end up with 10 healers all being DPS spec, tanks being arms etc.
---
Cataclysm patch 4.1, may 2011.
---
I took breaks from WoW for 1-2 months from early 2006 until late wotlk. I became disillusioned with the game in early wotlk. The crappy heroics, the watered down naxx raid we ran so often. Ulduar was fun, then ToC hit and I quit for 9 months.
---
I returned a few months before Cata to expeirence ICC, but was hyped for Cata. I liked the class designs I saw in the beta, the challenging heroics and raids. 4.0 was great, but my guild had torubles, because many couldn't keep up with the demanding heroic raids. A splinter gorup of the guild decided to form a 10 man elite raiding guild. I declined to join, as I preferred 25 man raids. My guild proceeded to disintegrate. Then 4.1 hit, which dubmed down heroics to wrath levels and that was the last straw, which made me quit the game forever.
---
If by “not far from” you mean “just about” then you are correct. 
---
It’s not really an either or scenario with warriors, as in, they aren’t the slowest or the hardest. Some classes are slower and some are harder. Warriors are hard and slow which is the real issue. 
---
Anyone that has time can level a warrior, that’s not the point. It’s that relative to leveling nearly every other class your experience will be more difficult and slower. That is not a bad thing for every player and some people will choose the class just because of this.
---
yeah it was one of the few stand-alone servers until they removed server tags completely and grouped it in with other rp realms
---
This is only level 1. You have to attach a custom desk to your lazy boy.  Check out amazon. Its a thing.
---
You still need to raid on it to get the gear tho lol.
---
Yeah this really doesn't bother me at all. If I really only want the one item the leader is reserving,  I won't join that group. But, chances are there will be tons of loot that will make the trip worth it for me, even if one or two items are reserved.
---
Stopped playing in Cata. Most of my guild had quit before raiding, I lost interest when I didn't have the people I had been playing with playing anymore.
---
Before the thousands of random reaction channels?
---
I stopped at the end of WotLK. 
---
In vanilla I played a mage. I got rank 14 and cleared every raid (including Naxx - though we had to combine raids with the other top guild on our server to clear 4 HM before BC). 
---
The same in BC. Cleared every raid (including Sunwell). 
---
In WotLK I swapped to Death Knight. Got my server first lvl 80 DK. Then cleared every raid on heroic (with multiple server firsts) throughout the expansion. Was the first person on the server to get Shadowmourne. 
---
Why I quit? I was burned out. Raiding 3-5 days every week took a big toll. I wanted to quit before The Ruby Sanctum, but I owed it to my guild to help them clear it while we searched for a replacement. 
---
I didn't delete anything, I think I still have something like 300k gold and all my gear. 
---
Gaming wise I looked into SC2 and then later Dota2 (both with multiple friends I made online).  
---
Do I regret my time in WoW? No. I had great moments, met a ton of cool people (guild meetings in RL were fun!). I am still in weekly contact with 4-5 people I met during my WoW time, 9 years later. 
---
I would not play classic if it were just me. But some of my RL friends (that I barely get to see) are considering classic, so I would join them, just so I could have more contact with them. I know it will be super casual. I will probably quit within half a year, since I will not go into heavy raiding / pvping again. I know what is required for that and I'm not willing to spend so much time.
---
I mean, they can USE daggers, Felstriker is part of their ore-bis, but after that it's like there are swords and axes that are better for warriors to dps with than a dagger... Maybe because of edgemasters? Idk 100% why but I do know I've never seen a warrior that wanted to do good dps use a dagger outside of Felstriker. Or maybe it's because they were willing to pass on daggers to rogues for whatever reason (wanting swords, thinking/knowing a rogue would get better use out of a dagger?)
---
So in that regard to me, it's a meme spec.
---
And it's a stupid fucking idea, because you STILL need to respec weekly so you can actually get gear on this second char.
---
Arms &gt; Fury for PvP, but a blue geared Arms Warrior will still do much worse than a raid geared Fury Warrior for PvP.
---
People lost the ability to think I believe.
---
Started playing at the launch of Wrath and played a Resto Druid. Raided with a pretty casual guild who slowly progressed but had a great time, especially in Ulduar. My guild had not cleared through the last few bosses in Ulduar yet by the time ToC came out. Unfortunately around that time my parent's computer started dying and would basically power off any time I was in a 25 man raid. It could just barely handle 10 mans. So I quit the game at this point. Always regretted never getting the chance to complete Ulduar as that place was magical for me as a kid.
---
Because legion isn't designed to have a lot of different things on screen. The game lags server side if 30 people are in the same fuckin area.
---
Antisocial refers to criminal behavior.
---
So you're abandoning the claim of an advantage. Good.
---
It sure seems like that's the reason. Because you haven't offered a better reason.
---
This has been brought up countless times and this "fix" does not solve anything. It's esentially the same as server merging. Layering is the best solution we have, it's the lesser evil.
---
 I expect a MINIMUM of 6 million players returning to WoW, for Classic, a realistic 8 million, and a possible 10 million.   
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
without friends is another level of hardcore when playing a warrior.
---
most bossfight stuns cannot be resisted
---
"If I run at them I will not waste any time trying and failing"
---
At least we don't stink as much, mon :&gt;(
---
But yet the alternative is actually to split up the players into different servers, and then most want to combine them after a few months (which to me seems even worse). Blizzard isn't wrong in the fact that there will be a huge dropoff after a month or 2, but the solution isn't as easy as people here seem to think. With a cooldown tied to layering i think it fixes most of the issues people have had.
---
Compared to hunter or warlock its awful but if you just put the time into making sure you get good weapons and gear you will do fine, getthing the WW weapon at 30 makes you a god, its basically a lvl 40 weapon.
---
hey b0ss
---
Nah
---
&gt; never played Vanilla.  
---
&gt; project was literally spearheaded by a Vanilla dev
---
Cant make this shit up.
---
need to find yourself a guild that plans for this and only raids 1 or 2 nights in a row.
---
100g per week to have fun playing the game isn't actually that much gold in the grand scheme of things. It's like what? 4 hours of simple grinding mobs to just get vendor trash?
---
“What is Barrens Chat”?
---
geofram is a toxic troll who plays dumb and just wants attention. Spell batching obviously needs work.
---
I think it’s a dickhead move if there’s 7k on the line BUT i also believe that people are entitled to be dick heads and if you’re putting that much money on the line plan better. They could have done what they did at the end at the start or have picked a better start that is much harder is super difficult to grief such as Kara crypts or the very tip of eastern kingdom.
---
LF DPS.  No meme specs.
---
Almost pissed myself hahaha
---
Getting a spot in a good guild is also much more difficult when you're just another DPS though as opposed to a Prot Warrior.
---
&gt; 1 million returning players (a slightly higher number than 800k Nost accounts created) 
---
so how many of those 800k will play classic?
---
Not a single person I know returning to classic played on p-servers.
---
I cant imagine that there will be less returning players then p-server players.
---
Kodo is king of all mounts.
---
The vanilla design team wanted and intended all specs to viable and to have racial spells for each class. They admitted to making mistakes and running out of time. Kevin Jordan said racial spells were simply “low bang for the buck” so they were cut.
---
Sometimes I feel comments like yours ascribe some sort of divine creation to wow, as if it were a perfect game and any changes to it would by definition be bad. It’s dogmatic and frankly just weird. 
---
The min max point is a good one. But if it’s good for priests why isn’t it good for other classes? 
---
And if you think it’s homogenization and yet also a minmax pressure point, I don’t follow. What does homogenization in wow mean to you? To me it means making players more fungible and decreasing their identity. Saying “priests are the only class with racial spells and giving the same to other classes is homogenization” makes no sense to me, because it doesn’t change anything about the distinctiveness of characters in game and their playstyles, if anything it makes it more granular and less homogenous. But again, the min max point is a good one and the biggest reason not to do it, to me.
---
Not to devalue your point here, but calling people stupid for spending their own money however they want is ignorant.
---
Sorry but that doesn't work at all.
---
yea. While the tv is bigger you are further away. A regular old monitor would appear in your vision about as big anyway
---
I've played multiple times.   
---
I started close to the end of Vanilla, when there were simply too many of my friends playing for me to keep ignoring this phenomenon. Didn't manage to get to 60 before TBC hit, but then once it did, I overtook all my friends and started raiding. This was around age 14 or 15 which is when kids here in Denmark usually start partying / drinking and caring about being cool more than anything - so after some time I quite WoW along with LARP. IIRC it was a bit after the Black Temple came out.   
---
I then started again a bit into Wrath, when I had started high school and gotten a bit less concerned with being cool (or maybe I was just around nicer people) - I was boosted to 80, got free epics from 40-man Naxx, and then quickly started raiding at a fairly serious level, so once again, I didn't really get to play with the people that convinced me to start. I raided Trial of the Crusader and ICC a lot, and cleared a lot of it on heroic too (which for me was rather big). I quit before that final raid came out. As I recall I just kinda lost interest / had a lot of fun with my friends in high school.  
---
I haven't played retail since then, but have then played on two Vanilla servers and one TBC server, but never stuck around long enough to experience anything after BWL. First server I quit due to loving back to Denmark after an exchange semester, so mix of having plenty of stuff to do / having to find new guild due to time zone. With the other two servers I just ran out of stuff to do, either due to content gap (T4 cleared and had been super lucky with gear / tried playing enhance on the N-server, didn't go well)
---
In all cases, now that you have had me think back, I had started WoW due to RL friends convincing me, but then started playing too much to keep playing with them, leaving me to play alone with whoever I met on the servers, rather than the friends that got me to play.   
---
Really looking forward, and this time it's the REAL DEAL, so all of my friends will be playing, we'll have a guild of old "veterans" that are in the "I know my BiS lists, rotation, etc, by heart, but I can't be assed with consumable-farming"-category. So it's probably gonna be pretty chill but still getting a lot of content cleared. I'll probably be the one with the least time, so no chance of me leaving them behind and being all alone this time.
---
Isn't it fairly agreed upon in /r/wow that Lore is an idiot and has done far more harm to Blizzard than good?
---
&gt; they’re BIS for non humans and non orcs. 
---
Like I said, meme.
---
Who said anything about raid group you salty bugger
---
I raided from Vanilla to Wrath, but got bored after Heroic ICC and switched to PvP.  Made Glad in season 9 and quit because biochemistry took too much of my time.
---
The cooldown is the (or part of the) fix. Just because you dont like it doesnt mean it doesnt address a problem, and that it isnt a viable solution.
---
&gt; didnt play pserver
---
I've seen plenty of comments indicating pserver launches were terrible due to over-population. Launch overpop is exactly what layer aims to address.
---
But yea man, totally. You've got all the best life experiences, theres not possible any experience a literal Vanilla dev has that makes him a better candidate for working on this than you. All hail u/evasi0ns
---
Will no one think of the Monkeys!
---
The only sales figures in that source is day one sales of expansions, which tells absolutely nothing. If you want more evidence of retention rates [here's](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98245-Only-30-Percent-of-WoW-Players-Get-Past-Level-10) an article from 2010 with Morhaime talking about their efforts through the trial program which ended up having less than a 30% success rate. 
---
"trial players who play World of Warcraft past level ten are much more likely to stick with the game for a long time"
---
"Currently, only about 30 percent of our trial players make it past this threshold."
---
And also: "So anything we can do to improve the new player experience is a huge opportunity for us." Indicating how, as I said, this was a high priority for them at this point.
---
Don't you need an active sub to download the game?
---
5% is essentially 5% base mana cost reduction for Holy Light/Flash of Light and an occasional increase in healing done which often just results in overhealing. It's by no means mandatory. If you have problems with mana, just chug more mana potions/runes.
---
You're not wrong. I'm mostly poking fun at what I once thought was a good way to play. Like MutedKiwi was talking about people that go to town and AH every couple of levels. It just slows you way down.
---
I quit right around the end of TBC, during the WOTLK patch. I didn't like the direction the game was headed at that time. The class balance seemed perfect in TBC and during the last patch before lich king it seemed like all the classes got overpowered abilities. I remember the first time I hit Bladestorm with the season 4 bonegrinder and everyone around me died from one button press. Hunters got some new shot that was like mortal strike, and it was looking like the beginning of the class homogenization process. It felt like a good time to quit so I did. 
---
Now here I am over 10 years later wanting to play again.
---
Thats right, silly me.
---
The music sucks
---
Layering as it is explained on wowhead sounds great, much much better than sharding.. You're basically in your own little pocket server inside of your server, everyone that you meet in the world will stay in that pocket server, in every zone, for the duration that layering is implemented. It's only as if you are on a less populated server, but you won't even notice this because there will be so many people with the release of classic. And then as the amount of people stabilize, these pocket servers are taken away, and everyone that was in them is released on the same server they have been on all that time. The only downside I see to it is that you wont get to meet those people on a different layer than you for those first couple of weeks that layering is turned on. But realistically you'll never remember all of them because without those layers there would be too many players anyways. Where as with the layers you'll be more inclined to see the same face and recognize them.
---
I agree Blizzard still has to fix the layering, or I think they have by now, where people are phasing in and out randomly. Without that hitch, layering to me, sounds perfect.
---
I was thinking about somerhing like this:
---
I lie down on the floor and put the image with a projector on the ceiling. Does anyone have experience with a setup like this? No sarcasm
---
EU Horde German PvP. Looking for semi hardcore or leaning hardcore looking for guild.
---
We dealth with grievers back in 2004, the beta has lasted for little over a month and people are already crying at blizzard over these grievers.
---
Are you kidding me? Has the wow community dematured to the point where a bunch of "grown ups" cant handle a couple kids?
---
We could back in 2004, why do we need daddy blizzard to solve our problems now?
---
Remember how everybody was praising Vanilla wow for the community aspect? Cause it forced people to act decent or risk being outcast from the community. As soon as it actually comes into play however yall run back to modern retail tactics like bans and kicks. When back in the day we took the situation in our own hands and kept things inside the game. As it was ment to be.
---
These grievers wont last a week at lvl 60, its really hard to get BIS when nobody invites you to a dungeon. Its really hard to get epics when nobody wants you in their guild. This is how we handled it back then, and its how we should handle it now in 2019.
---
I've never seen this.  Played since march 05
---
I don't really appreciate you escalating this to the point you are comparing me to a flat-earth believer. My goal in any position is to have either the 'right' position or the 'strongest' position. I am always willing to change my position based on new evidence. If there are any concerns, I am absolutely not a flat earther, vaccines are amazing, Citizens united is a terrible ruling, and concentration camps are abhorrent. 
---
Back on topic. You linked a video that completely illustrates how I said layering works. I don't see many people mention mobs randomly phasing out, in fact I think this is the first time I have seen that mentioned. When I played on the stress tests (quite a few hours/days), the only time this happened to me was during the dynamic layer changes/updates by the devs.
---
This leads me to the conclusion that the 'weird' monster layering is either very rare, or only happens when devs are changing layering dynamically. I understand you believe I should land at a different conclusion, but the evidence doesn't really support that currently.
---
In Vanilla I would say my DP was dispelled roughly ~80% of the time I used it, and the times it wasn't dispelled was a 1v1 fight I was probably going to win anyways.
---
You're doing it wrong, that's why I replied.
---
Because it can be used to gain an advantage. Say you change every gnome and dwarf model into Tauren. Now it's easier for you to target them in PvP, and one of the advantages those players chose when they picked Gnome goes away.
---
raptors look cool but their bouncy run animation is just annoying
---
Nyeees
---
Layering will be long gone before tier 2 anyway. Please stop with the misinformation
---
I kindof disagree, although the fact that asmondgold mob stealing posse sucks if you want to level the fact that it happens makes the world more active and alive. That comes with pros and cons.
---
Definitely #1
---
Same here, need to update the launcher tho.
---
Turns it into a KBMO.. Kind of Big Multiplayer Online
---
Same. Never saw anyone using DD.
---
Imma play with gamepad
---
I believe it does. People don't have an issue with layering, they have an issue with layer-hopping. Like the other comment suggested, just lock players to a given layer and keep them there until layering is taken away. The server-layer community won't be split and you won't have people abusing layer-hopping.  
---
It's not the same as server merging, because it all takes place on the same server. Players and Guilds wouldn't be allowed duplicate names, which is usually the biggest issue with merging.
---
Depends on how you define good. If you mean world first race material than you may be right. If you mean making friends, hanging out and downing bosses together than no,
---
I think it's a great solution, at least as it is explained on wowhead. Sure if Blizzard doesn't fix the weird phasing in and out, it'll still be shit. But if its working as it is supposed to work, then I think it'll be perfect. You're just going to be in your own little pocket realm I feel like, but this pocket realm aka layer, wont feel little because of the sheer amount of people in those first couple of weeks. I will definitely prefer this over fighting over one mob for hours in Elwynn..
---
When posts related to new/unique concept content like this get upvoted it really makes me believe a patch 1.14, 1.15, etc are possible.  
---
Some folks push the need for BC, but posts like this seem to do really well.  
---
I loved BC but I also think a lot of nostalgia seekers truly enjoy being in Azeroth, more so than Outland which could be one of the key reasons why post naxx content patches in seems appealing to many.  
---
Getting vanilla themed Hyjal and grim batol would be excellent.  Extra dungeons, perhaps a tier for dungeon set 3 that improves .05 tier.  A raid tier that isn’t necessarily better than Naxx, but with different itemization? 
---
The possibilities are endless.
---
God damn right.
---
&gt;The problem is that when too many people are on the same servershard, this shard will crumble.
---
There would have to be literally hundreds, maybe thousands, in one place.  Even if there was a 10-20 minute rolling queue, that should prevent this the first few hours of launch, the ONLY time this is a worry, since it would allow players to flow out of the starting zone.
---
&gt;it also does not make sense to build servershards that are strong enough to handle 1000 players on the same spot because that barely happens and would be a waste of resources for the one time every 6 months an event like that would happen.
---
Perhaps if they spent the resources on that instead of layering we would have it.  Also, they can't be far from this, I've seen hundreds of players in one spot and the game run fine back in wrath.
---
The legend!! Nice to see these again! Hope to see some more
---
First of all, there is no cloth turnins. Second i think you’re missing a page worth of quests, basically mulgore, barrens, stonetalon,thousand needles give way more than the 10k you’re describing. There should be atleast 150 quests. Atleast. My research/guesswork is about 170
---
I stopped playing early cata, reasons were that the game wasn't really capturing my attention that much any more. While I enjoyed the new races I felt like something was missing. 
---
Plus during that time I was heading off to collage to get down and dirty with my broke ramen every night eating ass. But having since graduated and moved a bit up in my own right I'm looking forward to classics release.
---
The tank will be targetting all of the mobs to generate threat, if I'm targetting a mob that should die last when you /assist me, then you're going to be generating threat on a mob that I'm not intending on throwing more than a single revenge/shield slam/sunder on to cover healer threat.
---
Because instead of choosing a target intelligently, you chose the target lazily.
---
This is my hope too. 
---
After all that time Blizzard needs a passion project for its core fanbase to keep itself true. I hope Activison also sees this and will give some Blizz-projects some financial freedom. We have seen with Diablo, that their core playerbase still wants meaningful gameplay over simplyfied gameplay.
---
I really hope they will reveal some plans this Blizzcon what the future of Classic will look like. Will it go down the road and reintroduce the addons. Will it be a onetime service for game preservation. Will they take the OSRS route and slowly introduce some well thought content with community collaboration. And my final hope, they'll use Classic to observe and study whats the secret of the success for WoW - and maybe work on a successor.
---
Ive seen it in “special” servers, seems American, like VC which triggers me just as hard.
---
I LOVED vanilla wow, then when tbc came out something felt off to me. I carried on until L70 anyway but knew that I wasn't immersed in the game anymore due to several factors. One of the things that bothered me was a suspicion that they were going to just turn every noteworthy character of WC3 into raid bosses. 
---
Lo and behold, WotLK comes out, promising Arthas as a raid boss. I had no difficulty quitting then and there before I had even tried it out, and don't at all regret doing so, even now.
---
Im not saying to be an asshole or not make small talk, just the majority of players just do their own thing. Most of the interaction happens at cities and outside instances. I was speaking more about the leveling experience. 
---
In retail, it's *almost* better because of the shared mobs. If someone is struggling against a big mob there's more incentive for randoms to lend a hand because they still get rewarded. You're gonna see people in classic wait for you to die so they can tag the mob themselves, where you don't get that at all in retail. There's still resource sharing obviously, but not with people outside your group. People will still help regardless, but there's definitely incentives to lean towards selfishness in vanilla. 
---
Vanilla required more interaction because of the lack of outside resources. No one could find mankrik's wife, so barrens got spammed with it. Now you can google it quicker than it would take to ask in game, a lot of people did it out of necessity. Same thing happened when lfr came out. It killed the community because anyone who didn't want to even softcore raid stopped pugging themselves, and made normal raiding much more in-guild.
---
Use retaliation - die anyway
---
Lol. Point missed.
---
Thanks! Indeed site is back, took some work. Indeed I did try to make some items that would let lesser used specs see more play. Not much point in having those specs otherwise.
---
I am making more dungeons, havn't settled on one yet though. Thanks for the suggestion ;) T4 would be fun to make.
---
These are so cool. Just needs more Shaman tanking gear :D
---
Are you US? I'm almost 100% sure it's available regardless of being subbed or not but only on US-based accounts so far - most likely will become available for EU also in 2 weeks.
---
&gt;Im not sure here. But i dont think bears needa acuria. Def not over a rogue or dps war.
---
You think Accuria should go to a DPS Warrior?
---
Ahahahaha
---
Accuria is also essential for Bears. It's extremely difficult to hitcap without it, and a tank that isnt hitcapped wont produce as much threat, meaning it impacts the guild a lot more than a DPS missing slightly more.
---
Priest and Druid are virtually invincible to mobs and against similar level players whilst warriors are free kills for most...
---
I'm a private server elitist? How do you figure that?
---
If they are keeping it true to classic, they won't have 100s of thousands of people trying it day 1.
---
I thought groups moved into the same layer, was this changed?
---
I agree, but it does ruin the community. You don't recognize anyone.
---
Ahh, these clueless idiots talking out of their asses give me joy lol
---
Ferals are actually quite strong in preraid gear.
---
This isn't about smoothness. This is about response delay, something a lot of PC displays are also very much guilty of.
---
Tbh, you don't even really need to be prompted. You can set some rules to assign players to a layer that would work for 90% of players.
---
1. Assign to the same layer as any existing characters
---
2. Assign to the same layer as characters from BNet Friends.
---
   1. In the case of friends spread across multiple layers, assign to the one with the most friends
---
   2. When friends are evenly split across layers, assign to the lowest population layer that a friend is on
---
3. Assign to the lowest population layer
---
I think he’s pretty funny.
---
Alright alright,  I'll allow it, only cause it's not permanent lol
---
//begins a slow jog toward nearest graveyard to shorten corpse run.
---
Need layering tho, too many people
---
Well smoothness can play into perception of delay, but yes I get where you're coming from.
---
Pala is MUCH faster than warrior.
---
Rogue is warrior with worse Armor but much more escape options and stealth.
---
Warrior is the slowest, easily.
---
Eh, I think the abbreviation "DD" came with WotLK where the standard in-game RDF called DPSs as DDs. I really don't think it's a vanilla WoW thing.
---
That’s a different spam.
---
Dead realms are fucking awful before you are able to merge and merging creates problems with server identity and name changes, ruining vanilla immersion.
---
Layering just means everything will settle down after 2 or 3 weeks and I'll be on an active server with the name I want and people I know.
---
It is possible. There are a ton of interesting things that could be done with Classic. It will be fun to see where Blizzard takes the game.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
The lottery is taxed and part of the money goes to education. That benefits other people, not just you.
---
... Realms?
---
Saw that earlier, didn't realize it was a real(?) flower. Likeness is striking.
---
you really haven't been paying attention
---
There's a lot of fucking morons on the Internet. They all share one thing in common. They believe their uninformed opinions make them smarter than everyone else.
---
You do realize Layering is not meant to help with that issue? You still have 500 people on day 1 trying to kill wolves in northshire.
---
Layering is only meant to help with the issue of people getting bored and leaving the game after a month. Layering makes it easy to merge those servers and keep a healthy population. You're still going to have 500 people in northshire on launch, it's going to be disgusting.
---
I met an old friends yesterday at the store. He used to be super hardcore, setting alarms for dream dragon spawns and such. I asked if was excited for classic. His respons was "im gonna try it out for sure, but I've already finished every thing in classic so I'll probably go back to retail when s new expansion launch.
---
I'm pretty sure Alot of people are of this mindset. I'm not even sure myself,current goal is I want to raid atleast.
---
You can't wrap stackable items.
---
It is the same as server merging in the sense that you would get one overpopulated layer and several other underpopulated layers. It does not solve the dynamic population management problem that layering do and it will cause the same issue. You will have 100 people chasing a single boar in Elwynn Forest on layer 1.
---
oh how i miss him..
---
You would be lucky to find a raid spot as nightfall bitch in a medium range guild.
---
That's 0-1 raid spots in average guilds.  Good luck

Pandas.
---
My biggest issue with vanilla has always been people thinking they know your class better than you.
---
Everyone thinks they are a literal god at WoW after playing a character at 60, hell just read the 'what should I play?' threads, practically everyone who comments comes across as a know-it-all number crunching prodigy who's word is law.
---
Drives me nuts.
---
What is layering?
---
what is most telling is all those claim rppvp guilds would go rp and them mainly shifting to pvp
---
I will be find because I know how to easily and rather effortlessly make money in the game.
---
I feel bad for the non raid viable spec players and the ones who won't be able to join battlegrounds because they are pve spec
---
Exactly this. The people who complain about the "awful warrior leveling experience" are the ones standing still tanking hits instead of hamstring kiting, not keeping weapons up to date via tanking dungeons once in a while, not hamstringing mobs that flee etc. 
---
The good thing is these people won't make it to 60 and compete for gear :)
---
Haha, I'm glad I stopped before I saw that travesty.
---
Lowering the costs so we can minmax tailor our Talents to the Situation is a step towards retail, i Like the Dilemma. And i will raid AS pure PvP Arms war because anything Up to naxx is a complete Joke. Pure raid specs are only needed for raid speedrun rankings
---
This
---
Lol control the Valley, he says
---
I can tell you the worse place for information
---
This Reddit page ;)
---
&gt; comparing quest rewards from Vanilla to BfA
---
Do you have the vid to share? That sounds interesting.
---
Everything is selfish in that regard. We do stuff that makes us feel good.
---
Because that's what was said about the retail layering as well, and yet here we are.
---
Why’d you get silver for this lol. Picking a layer, or layering at all, shouldn’t be a thing after about a month of the release. Besides, your idea of picking a layer is literally just picking a server, but with extra steps. Layering should only apply to immediate starting zones, like Northshire, Elwynn, then Wesfall. But everything’s past that is normal until after a month.
---
Thing is, it's hard to find relevant data because the vast majority of ferals (probably over 95%) don't use this technique. If you look for guides online, most people just gear it full agi with some str and don't use the helmet for extra energy. No matter how many BiS you equip, with this setup, you'll always have low dps. It's not viable for raids unless you spend a lot and farm manual crowd pummeler. When I was playing feral on a Pserver, I looked for obscure builds using this technique and I remember one having relevant numbers. A feral using this rotation, in full BiS, compared to other melee dps using their optimal rotation, also in full BiS, had the 3rd highest melee dps in the game.
---
And about the Crowd Pummeler, it gives melee attack speed, not haste. It would absolutely increase your dps, but you already use less melee attacks using the powershifting technique than you would with a traditional non-viable build. 
---
Also, although it's a good levelling stat stick, some vanilla weapons have amazing stats like 22str 15 agi, that would be like 60 attack power on a single item. I'd say the buff the crowd pummeler gives, 50% attack speed, would make you melee attack one or two more times each rotation. With how powerful Shred is, I think 60ap on three shreds would be about equivalent or even better. This is pure speculation though, we'd need statistics, but I can't really see it being more than a 5-8% damage gain on this build. On a tradition feral build however, this weapon is incredible, but the build itself is not powerful enough for raiding.
---
It's a completely different game, WoW was always known for it's server specific communities. You can't compare them and say it's applicable to what people want and expect from WoW.
---
According to the devs a layer is continental wide and will contain the number of people a Vanilla server had. I don't see how that will help with starting zones. It will still be packed af.
---
&gt; Preventing exploits, preventing immersion damage due to layer hopping, I guess these things qualify as "nothing" to you.
---
Yeah, it solves those because you are esentially throwing layering out of the equation. You still need dynamic population management during Phase 1 or you will have 100 people chasing a single boar in Elwynn Forest during launch.
---
ICC was actually a great raid too. I was lucky enough to do both Ulduar and ICC but I personally skipped the TOC tier. I did that raid a couple times and said screw it. I think all the raids since then have overall been solid
---
Are you going to mortal strike the boss? ;)
---
On the way home I would turn on a road called Silver Leaf. Just made me long for those old days of giddy excitement running into Sungrass or Wild Steelbloom. Hot damn.
---
This, just put a level cap on it. Layering won't matter in the lower level zones, and people should be spread out enough at higher levels that it isn't that bad. Just force people onto the "main" layer once they reach a certain level.
---
Ya man. Every single thing I post is designed to be as salty as possible.
---
People still don't like BfA players, not just classic players either. The people playing retail don't like the direction BFA took from legion.
---
Since they can't separate by zones, that everyone seems to keep asking them to stick it to starting areas only, doing it by level makes sense.
---
The busy areas are going to be the starting areas, where you'll have low level players.  Let them sort their shit out and then by their 30's once you really start moving to contested areas like STV, you'll be out of the layers.
---
All the "they'll ruin the economy layer hopping" guys are really only getting resources from 30+ areas anyway, so keeping anyone 30+ in the same layer would solve that.
---
Layers should also solve the problem with to many people fighting over resources during the initial weeks where everyone would be forced into the same few low level starting zones.
---
Lol, I even like EDM but that song...
---
should be online till the 12th
---
as far as the amount of quests go you might be right. but the quests on classicdb.ch have too much reputation. the first questchain "a humble task" should give 50,100,100,150,75 according to wowhead (since the got the addon to sync there numbers with beta i think those are correct) classicdb lists them as 75,250,250,350,150
---
thats a HUGE difference.
---
and i got a kodo in vanilla on my orc, took me 4weeks of farming runecloth and every quest i could find. sadly i dont remember values but i know i spent a fucktone on runecloth farming
---
meh, that looks like too much fun, can we get some layering going on here?
---
But you are missing the point: layering isn't static.  You will be switching layers often.  Everyone else will be switching layers often.  You will not have a static layer.
---
Even if people change layers 25% of the time each day, by day 7 only ~18% of the people that started in your layer will have not shifted layers... That's if *you* didn't switch layers *at all*.  Some of them may shift back, so that percentage will drift towards 33% if there's 3 layers, 25% if 4, etc.
---
And let me be clear, you don't have a *home* layer or anything like that.  You're placed in a layer situationally every time you log on.
---
I don't know how you watch that video and think "layering is static".
---
Ya sadly :/  I'll have to see if there is a way to fix that.
---
Every time.
---
It's scary that people speak so confidently about stuff they know nothing about.
---
It was a big reason the game lost its “feel” to me. Vanilla, BC, and WotLK still felt dark and gritty. Pandas made is Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
---
Yup - def spriest
---
Is this one of those new BFA races I keep hearing about?
---
You get less rep if quest is green/gray than yellow/red
---
Pretty much this. If you have a permanently selected "layer" you've fundamentally created a server.
---
You cannot have played vanilla, if you think revered by lvl 45 is in any way realistic.
---
I was a dwarf in vanilla and I had ironforge barely at revered on lvl 60. 
---
What does 184 thunderbluff quests even mean? If they give on average 50 rep, that's just 9k, even a generous 100 rep per quest on average is only 18k. That would put you barely at revered after doing every single thunderbluff quest.
---
But the average is likely quite a bit below 100 rep per quest, roughly somewhere between 60-75. Rep gains weren't that high in vanilla. You didn't get 250 for most quests. 100 is already a major rep gain. If you go by classicdb.ch numbers you are in a for a rude awakening. Eg the mulgore quest poison water yields 250 rep according to classicdb, only 100 on classic.wowhead. Alpha Strike is 150 rep on classicdb, 75 on classic.wowhead. The entire woodpaw questline (4 quests in Feralas) is 625 rep on classicdb and 300 on classic.wowhead.
---
And you can be sure the lower figures are what's accurate for vanilla and you calculate with figures about twice as high as they really were.
---
literally the worst choice (even more than a troll, who is at least flippant mostly) for a community manager they could ever have made. His ridiculous appearance and voice aside, the guy has been about as useful as a glass hammer.
---
Are you serious?  I've never seen +15 anywhere close
---
Ya a lot of the people still playing are probably just in a routine, or like you say addicted. I constantly see BFA players themselves saying how bad the game is now.
---
yes? doesn't invalide anything i said/listed
---
It's the time traveler that mention "vanilla", which is normal if he comes from the future
---
engineering isn't a small benefit.  race and priest racials are nothing compared to the power of engineering.
---
engineering by itself is like upgrading from full greens to blues, or blues to purples, or purples to oranges.
---
i'd rather have an engineer in quest greens than somebody who just farmed strat/scholo for blues.
---
I personally think it's *ridiculous* that they are scaling back their technology in an attempt to restore the 'feel' of a game when that feeling is just nonsensical, annoying interactions like "I used pummel but I'm still sheeped." 
---
These issues were extremely annoying--anything that makes the game not react like it says it should is bad and should be avoided, not leaned into because some dev thought it was cute that warriors would charge each other and swap positions.
---
Yup. Same reason they don't allow skins in FPS games. 
---
Some people will make their enemies appear bright white to give them a massive advantage, and other shit like that.
---
You sound terrible. 
---
I was double pulling lasher packs in dme in pre-bis and hitting lockout in less than 30 minutes.
---
They definitely weren't. Blizzard invited the Nostalrius team over 1.5 years before the announcement.
---
I know what J. Allen Brack said, but that was WAAAY before this article. Are you seriously saying people cannot change their minds, and after all those years since uttering those famous words, he couldn't possible have seen the interest and love for the original game?
---
Regardless, the quote the thread is about is *still* from the COMMUNITY MANAGER, not a developer.
---
Can anyone explain this whole black lotus thing to me? I know they are used to make flasks and are kind of rare in the world - how much do these things sell for on the AH? Are they really that hard to find?
---
Running through blizzard can be ok because it ticks, so realistically you could dodge the ticks (with some luck), but the trap thing not as much.
---
I think batching is ok, just needs to be lowered a good bit.
---
A couple months into BfA. I've played on and off since Vanilla for various reasons but never because the game was absolute shit until BfA came along. I didn't like Legion either, but it wasn't as bad as what they've got going on now. 
---
No amount of awesome zone design or raid design will get me to play an mmo who's core class gameplay and loot systems are trash. 
---
I was in a raiding guild at the time (mostly heroic but we did some mythic bosses as well), but it just got to the point where I was like, "Why the fuck am I paying to play a game I dislike? This is stupid," so I told my guild that I was quitting and the reasons why and left.
---
It is a violation of TOS and for a good reason. Changing model may be harmless for modifying aesthetics as you imply, but they can be abused (examples: changing the terrain to appear different - allowing moving through walls and floors or making the flag in WSG x20 times larger).
---
Berserking is a silly argument. It adds, in most scenarios, a 10% cast speed buff on maybe two mana burns once every 2 minutes. Hex* of Weakness is fine, but it's not something I'd point to as a reason to select Troll any more than I'd point to Touch of Weakness as an example of a damage debuff; in most 1v1 scenarios it's superfluous, and in most team scenarios it's a waste of a GCD compared to MS.
---
As for DP, bind it to autocast with IF. Mana problem solved.
---
I’ve only seen Russians write it when they write in English
---
This is such bullshit.  No one in the community asked for layering.  We asked for no sharding.
---
What you're saying is like if we asked for them to remove LFG, so they did but put in LFR.  Uhhhh NO!
---
I want the rogue teleport when sprinting "feature" that appeared due to bad internet, actually i want all the classes to have a random teleport spell to emulate the "true" vanilla experience.
---
I also want the charge/intercept bugs back, because "true" vanilla experience was a dice-roll if you ended up near your target as a warrior.
---
Imagine not realizing that layering essentially serves the same role as server merging minus the need to arbitrarily smash 2 vastly different server communities and economies together.
---
I like to add the missing attunements. All Raids apart from Naxx had perfect story potential for attunements. It's really sad. Also the newer dungeons had to good loot.
---
RP servers had stricter rules, could only get grouped with other RP servers, and currently there is no CRZ/Sharding in old zones (anything not tied to BfA content). This was brought on by issues with servers hosting very large RP events, but people who arrived for the events were being put in different shards. The preference to only shard RP with RP is still there, and as someone on a former RP-PvP server I typically see 80% Emerald Dream players. So it's kinda like I got a free server transfer that I didn't ask for.
---
The pain was real.  Leveling was a nightmare.   I almost quit leveling my druid, begging clannies for dungeon runs.
---
Because you're not taking 2 different realms with different communities and economies and putting them together. Layering is the same server with the same economy and the same community.
---
But the economies remain intact.
---
I confirm. 20pts spent in holy is to the minimum to be a good healer in raids.
---
In addition to the other replies you received. Not all attacks are normalized, hemorrhage for example is not.
---
For all the stuff you are doing in that phase of the game t1 for priest is an amazing set (for both PvP and pve).
---
lol acting like you're playing counter-strike or a twitch shooter.
---
Bruh, it's wow. 95% of players click their hotbar
---
Depends on how you define viable. The other specs are worse when raiding, but they don't kill a raid, because they are so terrible. If you go by pure raiding, then you are right, but there is more than that.
---
Every spec has their place somewhere. Elemental shamans are terrifying in pvp. Enhancement are strong as well. Feral druids make excellent flag carriers. Moonkins have good burst and control in pvp. Ret paladins are a strong pvp class and good farmers. Prot palas are excel at aoe farming large numbers of mobs.
---
Why is layering the solution they went with to fix the problem of over crowding? It seems like most people love the idea of seeing as many people as possible in the same persistent world but the situation of having to line up to tag a quest mob or gather a quest item is what they want to avoid. 
---
Is it possible for them to use dynamic spawn rates instead? Depending on how long the mob/item is active it gets its spawn rate adjusted. If a quest mob spawns and is instantly killed repeatedly, it would reduce the timer because obviously people are in the area.
---
I quit early in cata. Not entirely because of cata, hate how they destroyed the world, with all those changes and a few megatons of guild drama. 
---
I came back for legion and loved it then quit again in bfa because promised reworks of my classes never happened. BFA never felt right just like cata.
---
Just spec prot, get some good spell damage gear and damage shield gear (nagelring, force reactive disk, shard of flame, shield spike, etc.) and go mass pull the plaguelands. You'll do tons of damage to mobs with a decent loot table while being tanky and survivable. Then use your gold to respec holy for raids.
---
I mean... Warrior, I just said that beforehand. Hamstring and all.
---
But the leveling speeds of classes that aren't Mage or Hunter are pretty negligible in how close they are.
---
Free Action Potion or FAP for short. Frost oil for turn in quest.
---
Which is why included the morrowgrain repeatable. I can show you the numbers I used : [calc](https://imgshare.io/image/f5812988-ce26-4698-a9a0-03da48c4c310.Ohgt7)
---
Good point
---
That sounds good. Layering is mainly to combat 80% of the population quitting, not to help you kill boars.
---
No, you won't be using mortal strike on the boss.  Lol
---
You haven't raided vanilla in awhile have you?
---
This is wow, where the most downtime you have is 10 seconds while you eat.
---
Try rolling a warrior in Everquest as your first character, then let us know how difficult leveling one in wow is.
---
Reminds me of the [This is REALLY Eve](https://youtu.be/LmS9vcVNr5A) video
---
Every character can deal damage, dosnt mean they are good still
---
Time to get one of those:

---
unless your guild cares and checks dps meters i think doesnt matter because you cant inspect talents in vanilla.   i guess if you can still clear content easily enough then nobody will care what spec you are just turn up on time with consumes and dont fuck up
---
Cool but a lot of the loot in this dungeon would be very overpowered.
---
Yup same. Flying mounts was horrible in terms of breaking world immersion. I continued to play, but my satisfaction with the game dropped by like 70% after flying was released.
---
Retail doesn't have layering, it has sharding. And I don't ever remember them promising that sharding will be removed.
---
Arent the Override Rules the same in pservers? :o
---
Of all 20+ RP-PvP guilds that I know not a single one would go RP.
---
&gt;merging is the lesser evil.
---
Except it's absolutely not.
---
Explain to me why you believe merging 2 completely different servers with vastly different communities and economies is easier than layering *the same* community and *the same* economy?
---
I said non hardcore. Like in people that don't give a damn about how efficient is their class and playstyle before choosing it. And yeah there are even whole guilds thinking that way. Amazing huh? I know !
---
I'd say go undead just because devouring plague is more fun. You could minmax pve if you want but imo it would be less satisfying to a tiny number increase over a cool ability. Trolls get the shadow shield thing I guess if you like that. I'd say just choose based on the priest racial, which one you think is cooler, because you're going to spend a lot more time out in the world, and in situations where you don't really need to minmax than you are in situations where that tiny increase is going to matter. So it's much more important to pick what you think you're going to find fun.
---
I lost it when dungeons stopped being fun in WoD 
---
People would queue, join the dungeon, and wouldn't speak! Instead, they would argue about why we weren't moving fast enough, since dungeons were so easy, there was no reason why we shouldn't move faster. 
---
That and Garissons were dumb for me. Why do I want to stay in a remote place when the whole WORLD of Warcraft is out there for me to explore?
---
When i was leveling a boomkin in WOD, my leveling was basically "run around moonfiring stuff, not looting, because looting made you stop killing stuff". It was ridiculous.
---
Whats significance about the 12th/13th of aug?
---
All spell batching does is allow you to get off abilities you shouldn't. And some people (namely rogues) act like it takes a pvp God to gouge a blink.
---
Whoever has the quicker reaction time should get their ability off first. Having them go off at the same time is not only stupid, but it helps specific classes more than others.
---
&gt;!That makes me sad !&lt;
---
This isn't the same Blizzard Entertainment we all grew up with.  And while i'm very thankful to those in charge right now for bringing classic to us, lets not get it twisted.  This company no longer has any idea WTF its doing other than to make a buck for the corporate overlords.  They decided not too long ago to cash in on 20 years of well earned goodwill and they've just about sucked that well dry.  
---
This is the last gasp of a once great company.  Bottom line is they don't know what gamers want anymore.  They know how to make a quick buck, but the model is not sustainable.  OG Blizzard was run by gaming fans.  Literally the people at the top started the company because they loved PC gaming.  
---
Now, it's a bunch of out-of-touch know-nothings in suits with business degrees who's only real skill (if you can even call it that) is in scaming the fans out of the maximum amount of their cash.  This is the gaming industry in 2019.
---
Played loyally right up until six weeks after the BfA launch when I no longer felt excited to log in. I am over the moon excited to return for Classic.
---
So am I. 
---
I should have been clearer. About 10% of people who started Vanilla WoW actually made it to 60.
---
Quit for a while during the end of Vanilla due to RL stuff. Then my first real quit was at the very end of Ulda (never got to kill Algalon) due to guild falling apart and not enjoying tiered raiding. I liked the Ulda hard mode fights, but not a fan of the general concept of re-hashing the raids. 
---
It works for dungeons as a way to create a large stable of max level dungeons, but for raids it just sucks to clear a raid then go "let's do it again but with higher numbers". 
---
Then we had a little reunion for Cata, but ran into the same issues after clearing the hard modes of the first raids. It just ends up burning people out.
---
That’s a very important point to consider as normal hits come last in the attack table. Pumping up your crit% will significantly reduce the amount of regular attacks.
---
Was added to vanilla after mc and not with mc? Similarly majordomo loot wasn't there from start.
---
Exactly, how I feel. Back in the day I had a guild and community. I would log in and can find something to do but still help and be helped by those people. With the loss of identity and community there is no reason.
---
My laptop has an HDMI out and it has terrible input lag and locks me into 30fps when I use it. I have a GTX1050 so I honestly don't understand why it has these limitations.
---
A tank that need Hoj? You are the fucking NEXT.
---
I believe they have already got into the routine of constantly extending it.
---
DPS was the term used on every server I played on.
---
Depends if you can convince 39 other people to handicap themselves to allow you to play a less effective role.
---
Yes because its Not crucial. Did U ever so MC or BWL? Its piss easy and i wont (and my guildies) spend 200-300g per week lol
---
It is intended to do that. As in a comment below, I stated it’s literally there to prevent people from having to sit for 6-7 hours trying to kill Kobolds in Northshire. Even with layering, it was rough. When Classic initially launched there wasn’t this issue because WoW wasn’t the most popular MMO yet.
---
ZING!
---
Another retail fanboy enters the fray.
---
If you agree with the sentiment “layering fixes overcrowding” then you truly have no clue what layering is about, and you didn’t read the blue post. You just keep spouting the same nonsense you hear other posters spot.
---
**This is 100% NOT what layering is for.  Please go back and read the blue post.**
---
Layering DOES NOT and WAS NOT meant to change overcrowding. On launch you will STILL have 500 people in northshire fighting for wolves. EVERY LAYER will achieve that because it’s the target.  
---
Ffs, when did all these people come in the sub who have no clue about layering but voice their opinion on it
---
I know I have a guild ready of 35 people from way back when who all want to raid, absolutely none of us are subbed.  They're going to see a mass migration towards the servers.
---
Funny. I log into current wow and realize how terrible it is. Then log off.
---
It just feels slowgoing, because you don't need to hit a button every couple seconds, but SoC alone is a big dmg boost. Also don't see why you wouldn't use judgement, resealing is easy. And great, that you got crusader strike, a tbc ability, in vanilla.
---
Comapre it to warriors. Warriors get their first isntant attacks on lvl 36 with whirlwind and 40 with mortal strike. Before that they have nothing but autoattacks and abilities, which augment autoattacks. Seal of Command, when it procs is an instant 2nd attack, which bypasses armor and is a big dmg boost. Then you also have judgement every 8sec, an instant holy dmg attack ,which deals big dmg against incapacitated targets. 
---
So a ret has two "instant" abilities available by lvl 20, a warrior by lvl 40 and a ret doesn't have to build up rage first.
---
yeah, much better than what it is these days, but on the launch day you couldn't even login and if you managed to, you'll get Error 37.
---
I’d rather meet 1 in 3 people 3 times as often as meeting 3 in 3 people 1 time.
---
Actually the ret can also use eye of rand as pre bis ; )
---
This is totally accurate.

When BC content is eventually released (fingers crossed), you can actually make some decent gold flying around with it on looting max rank mana and health potions, as well as ore, leather, and herbs from [various world chests](https://www.wowhead.com/item=22829/super-healing-potion#contained-in-object).

We need a controller with a keyboard on it like the Xbox chapter for couch mmo grinding.

It’s BIS for threat generation. Lolz found the ret paladin.

"Perception" of delay doesn't matter when you need to react quickly. Just physical delay does.

Ashenvale be TROLL LAND! Get out soon and I be sparin' ya souls from an eternity of torment.

Same. I played half of Cata, took a break and came back for panda land. Once o got to the stormy island of infinite dailies and got tired of my lacking talents, I quit.
---
Here's a 10 minute video of streamers experiencing layering issues and talking about how stupid it is.
---
Also, like others have said, layering is actually really helpful for streamers, since without it people might flood their server, and it gives them the ability to escape gankers (which is a world pvp destroying flaw of layering in general).
---
Thats why you go night elf, for improved death
---
“Instead of balancing players around shards of zones and combining players from multiple realms, layering will allow realms to create a separate instance of themselves to balance their own population. However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in the same layer.” - wowhead
---
Hmm...
---
Let your melee dps have it first, you’ll need mitigation gear at the very beginning
---
Just so you're aware this dude is playing on a TV relaxing while leveling. He's not in a Face It final for CS:GO.
---
2 meme specs, mon. I didn't even see the elf casting wrath in the back.
---
Yup, vanilla had many many faults. Just wait a few months into launch for people to realise the limit of nostalgia.
---
I cleared naxx.  I been raiding vanilla for years now.
---
So you are ok with knocking off debuffs because they aren't used by your class?
---
Josh Allen is a moron that’s been out of touch for more than 6 years
---
Ever tried a fried gnome-on-a-stick with Sriracha? Yummy!
---
DD definitely was not in mainstream vanilla WoW. As a FFXI player, DD was the only term used, however, WoW introduced me to the term DPS after I couldn't make DD stick.
---
Oh thanks......I was just about to watch the 6th Element too.....
---
That's very optimistic! I absolutely hope you're right and we'll see million(s) of players. Blizzard may also not expect that many though...
---
That’s a good idea about Sunday’s. Thanks for that advice!
---
Phase 1 is Blotus phase.
---
Weapon speed only matters if you go for aim shot. But as most level BM it doesnt really matter.
---
Mate, please just go back and read the blue post on layering. 
---
Please do it. I want you to see how wrong you are, then realize how fucked we are, when you understand what launch will be like and how Layering doesn’t change any of that.
---
Please. Just read the blue post. You don’t understand layering right now.
---
Yeah, they want to avoid dead servers and server merges, which you solution does not fix, because what you've just described requires the eventual merging of what you call "layers" where nobody on each layer can interact with one another before the merge. That's just a server merge without the name clash problem. It only fixes that and that alone.
---
You are by *far* not the first person to have this idea and by far not the first to have it shot down, sorry dude.
---
Then don’t play, that’s how vanilla was. 
---
If you want a modern style play retail
---
Because he won't pvp or raid either I guess
---
&gt; what the fuck do you even mean by immersion?
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I would rather they just do nothing and leave it as is, force people to group up to get quests done and return people to an MMO experience. 
---
        
---
BUT, if they are going to cheese the servers to accommodate launch I would rather they just dynamically spawn 1-20 zones the first few weeks and be done with it. It's been done on Pservers with way higher launch pops. I would rather deal with the repercussions of that than a weird fractured world.
---
Good way to kill classic
---
Only trash American servers used VC. Cultured servers used DM.
---
Sure he probably will do you expect him to live on the couch forever? Christ..
---
Because that would be the SMART thing to do.
---
 \&gt;Prot pallies are 100% useless in a raid  
---
Fucking semantics, they are hardly useless if you put them to a role and they perform good enough in a subpar way.   
---
And I can agree that there will be a lot of wipes because of protection paladins and the recent positivity concerning hybrids but arguing that its impossible or that they are completely useless is just spreading false information. They are outperformed on everything but that does not make them useless, it makes them subpar, suboptimal, bad, shit, worst or super bad but hardly useless :)
---
Nice dress, brother!
---
Nah, he understood, from your way of arguing your point, that you 're pretty fucking annoying and extremely aggressive. Thus, you have more than 5 friends to make a raid group to quest is unlikely. As for your friends, I understand why they don't want to quests with you and will go with other friends. No need to be bitter about it.
---
Target population of 3k
---
At launch, *all layers will target 3k*.
---
You will have 500 people in starting zones with you *on your layer*.
---
Negative for the community?  It's only negative for someone who want the item(s) that are reserved, and that could be literally anyone depending on the reserves in question.  If you're playing a Warlock and someone says LF1M DPS UBRS Dal'rend reserved, are you really going to give a shit or are you going to be hyped because hey you need to do UBRS and this group just needs you and it's good to go, so let's roll!
---
Realistically, the only negative of the entire thing is its probably going to take longer for them to get their group going, which has literally no effect on the community at large, as everyone who joins that group is on board with the idea just by virtue of agreeing to join the group in the first place.
---
"temporary" my sweet summer child, you are totally being set up by ActiBlizz not seeing the hole you will be thrown into.
---
p servers are also very tiny
---
I actually want to be able to log in and play on release. They wont keep it for long so I don't see the issue as a pressure valve on release. They will of course need to turn it off after the first month or so. Itll help the crazy launch and well all get to play instead of starting at a queue log in screen.
---
The only time I ever had 300ms+ pings in vanilla was when I had to use dialup after the fiber feeding my local docsis node were cut during construction.  Otherwise I was always around 50ms.
---
That’s not true at all, layers create pop caps and merge new traffic to a new layer. Unless you want a full server worth of people in a starting area. I’ve tried that on pserver and it’s hell. Have you ever had to wait an hour in a que to log on to your server? There are so many problems with implementing the original release again and it’s shocking that people can’t seem to understand that.
---
Why are you getting so triggered
---
This so i wouldnt risk it... doesent matter if it make sense to u if its bannable u prob will get banned sooner or later for doing it...
---
It's a neccessary evil and the downsides are likely much less severe than the downsides of not having it.
---
I still very vividly remember what a fucking shitshow the first two or so weeks after launch were. I don't need that again. You're not gonna make a lot of friends with 15 people standing at a mob spawn all trying to tag it first.
---
Also, the prospect of half-deserted servers once the tourists leave really scares me. There I can't imagine anything nothing worse.
---
It's not a perfect solution but all alternatives I have seen suggested so far are significantly worse.
---
I also don't think it will hurt the community aspect all that much. Realistically, even without layering, you likely won't stay in touch with the bunch of randos you ran Deadmines with at Level 18 because some will outlevel you and you will outlevel the others. Also, most people will be busy questing by themselves or with RL friends.  
---
From my experience, social interaction becomes much more important and meaningful at higher levels, probably 50+, when people repeatedly run the high-level instances to gear up.
---
Im ok with everyone using their abilities aslong AS they have big Impact. 5 Arms warris Not being able to Mortal Strike ist worse than 5 warlocks Not being able to Cast affliction (early).
---
Hell id be fine with a fire mage in MC lol.
---
Yeah sure, he says he want "A", but he is talking about "B"  
---
How should i know what he means, im not a fortune teller.
---
That was their intention to begin with as it was in 2004. You don’t *need* to interact with the other layer. The point in 2004 was to keep each server its own world, and the point now is to keep each layer its own world.
---
There’s no need for layer hopping. Just merge layers when pop dies
---
well I wasn't talking about pre1.6, these were guilds and players running this build much later. I'm well aware of all the changes that happened to warriors, Bloodthirst only changed from 40%-&gt;45% in 1.9.0, the 40% BT was in game from 1.6.1. Either way it would easily stomp MS which you wouldn't even generally use on bossfights anyway. With the power of hindsight there was NO REASON to be 31/5/15, a useless build in any PvE context comared to the alternatives, past 1.6. If people had been good they would have realized that they could just run a (now standard) fury defiance build as soon a 1.6 dropped, which would annihilate the arms build in every facet of dps and tps (not having TM was probably the dealbreaker for people back then). Not like you'd be using MS or even wanting Deep Wounds before the debuff prioritization system anyway.
---
You've never played in non cross realm BG servers I see
---
Well with that in mind MC would be half empty, as there tons of items added over time.
---
Blizzard actually mentioned releasing dungeons in their 1.12 state considering they arent doing progressive itemization.
---
My money is on it being in the game at launch, well see ^^
---
I'm not, at all. But your ability to comprehend and think logically is mind-blowing lol.
---
&gt; classic has almost none of it
---
&gt;&gt; graphic overhauls/higher rez/better textures
---
It does though
---
&gt;&gt; some rebalance 
---
It does, the classic experience will be vastly different from the Vanilla experience from a balance perspective, as balance changes seen throughout the lifespan of vanilla will not be part of Classic, so you're going into MC, BWL, ZG etc with class balance that you didn't back during Vanilla.
---
&gt;&gt; bug fixes
---
pretty sure it has bug fixes
---
&gt;&gt; often some form of new content
---
We don't know that yet, since nothing for post naxx has been confirmed or denied.
---
&gt; New Crash games are perfect example of remasters
---
Remasters come in many different iterations. You have the Crash games (which some would even classify as a remake), then you have games like Sniper Elite 2 Remaster, which plays pretty much the same as the original but just has updated textures to make it look better. 
---
I don't believe classic to be a remaster, to me it's it own game. But if we had to compare it to something, it's definitely more comparable to a remaster than an expansion.
---
&gt; Expansion/version, same thing. Classic is an "expansion" just like any other wow version.
---
I don't know why you're so hellbent on arguing this. You keep saying its an expansion yet refuse to point out a single similarity to previous expansions in WoW. It doesn't add new content to the current game, it doesn't change balance of the current game, it doesn't impact the current game in any way, so please do enlighten me how is it an expansion? Expansions are an addon to the current game, Classic WoW doesn't add on anything. It's it own separate game that has been recreated based on an older version of WoW (kinda like, you guessed it, a remaster).
---
&gt; My laptop 
---
Ah there's your problem.
---
Some say Christopher rush spirit lives inside
---
yeah, sure, in the vanilla echo chamber those xpacs are obviously horrible, but not every wow player is a vanilla veteran. There are also people who enjoy modern wow (not bfa, but post Wrath wow). 
---
And those people (me included) enjoyed MoP and Legion
---
I don’t really care as long as we finish the dungeon.
---
yes, they queue it up and do free transfers to all the dead realms
---
I stopped playing after killing Lich King, i was already forcing myself to play, game was not challenging anymore. I think there was too much gear too widely available, and it was too powerfull aswell.
---
Daily quests are still to this day is the biggest bullshit ever created.
---
I switched to Aion back then and had a blast playing it even with all the issues it had.
---
•Asks if you will get banned for using updated models
---
•Gets told that it is indeed bannable
---
&gt;Well I honestly doubt anyone will be banned
---
Why do you even ask if you’ve already made up your mind beforehand?
---
Just FYI, these bans are automatic so you’re going to have little luck “escaping” the ban.
---
Whatever you say bud.
---
I play a warlock and never use any dots.  Ds/ruin is king
---
Totally agree on that. I have no idea why are people shitting so much on layering. I won't really matter until 20-30 lvl + by that time all the stress on servers will all be gone.
---
If you don't believe you revealed something about your character, then you should probably not speak to anyone.
---
Ret paladins are easy to spot. they're the person asking for dps gear while trailing behind the healer.
---
AFAIK "Eastern Kingdoms" didn't even exist in WC2. In WoW they were originally going to have one continent called "Azeroth" and that got split into EK and Kalimdor during development.
---
In true wow fashion - screen shots or it didn’t happen. Gottem
---
Nice man, join the club! I've been gaming from couches and recliners for 15 years or so. Only recently though getting the wall mount monitor arm. Huge game changer for positioning monitors exactly where I want.
---
Also get a hard mousepad! 
---
People be crazy thinking keyboard on lap is bad/uncomfy. It is the best position ergo-wise. Arm lower than heart, 90 ish degree angle, comfy armrest when keyboard not needed.
---
https://photos.app.goo.gl/RvTZqcSxxJy16gQ86
---
Yeah, sure they can. Then you guys will get your 6-12 hour queues you've been asking for, just like in vanilla!
---
&gt;I do think that they still have the entrenched view that retail &gt; vanilla
---
And anyone who thinks that is fully in their right to do so, your or my opinion of vanilla being better is merely subjective. There's nothing wrong with liking retail more than vanilla.
---
It's unfair for J. Allen Brack to get all this heat for a quote he didn't even say. He said some dumb shit back when but this isn't one of them, and he's definitely warmed up to Classic, as has the rest of Blizzard from what I've seen, or we wouldn't be less than 2 months away from it's release. I don't buy the idea that shareholders are simply forcing them to make it.
---
From the WoWHead post:
---
&gt;	If you dislike layering, worry not. Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players
---
Hm, so my issue of wanting it removed is happening, also, it’s technology used to make things less crowded, AND we’re 100% not fucked. I just read it and continued to realize how wrong *YOU* are.
---
The island off the coast of Booty Bay with the trolls was supposedly the left overs of an early Zandalar.
---
Thorns helps.  Demo roar and oil of immolation + grenades are usually enough for healers.  Need cancelaura reshift bear macros for usage though .
---
Yeah, so I've heard and there is that payoff I missed in not dealing with the Lich King. And yeah, so I've heard. In all honesty, I kind of regret not coming back for MoP from what I've heard, seems there were great raids during that and the Arena during the expac was apparently fantastic too.
---
My comment was completely irregardless of this quote
---
In Wrath, as a prot pally, I had a dps set I would do dungeons with pugs for dailies. I would pull all the mobs between bosses and dps them down. I was doing 30+ percent of the overall damage of the instance. Good times.
---
Umm, really? 40 is actually one of the weakest spots for ret paladins, especially in pvp.
---
I don't want a 6 hour queue just to DC and go back..
---
Omar is helping but isn’t calling the shots.
---
Whoever is in charge of Classic has no clue how important immersion is to the game.
---
seriously lol
---
I have played every expansion.  It's so streamlined, it's kind of gross.  PvP has been dumbed down too.
---
Zero immersion. Literally zero.  You 100% feel like you are playing a carnival game, not in the world.
---
I hate the retail talent system too.  It's strange how it seemingly *should* give you more options for customization, but instead results in even more cookie-cutter builds than vanilla. (FYI I'm talking mostly in terms of PvP here.)
---
I'll probably quit when layering ruins the game in Classic too.
---
I’m talking about during bossfights, in which case it is completely irrelevant if you don’t oom, and the boss dies
---
A pretty stupid hill to choose to die on.  Just don't join groups that reserve an item, problem solves itself and otherwise has no bearing on you.
---
You want your dungeon to last longer?
---
The feeling of getting stronger is a huge motivator in RPGs. Like in POE almost everyone has fun until red maps because the progression from complete scrub to mega killing machine is so significant and satisfying. A lot of people get burned out quickly after plateauing because that feeling of personal growth is gone. Upgrades aren’t a big deal, and not everyone cares about downing every boss, but everyone generally cares about getting stronger.
---
We've seen these problems come and go over every xpac/update. It's no joke when people say X isn't "viable" for the general populace. With good enough healers/dps, sure, you can  still do everything with a paladin tank, buy your going to need geared healers and dps that are amazing at threat control. Progression guilds are the ones who *are* able to use sub-optimal compositions because they're all tryharding content.  
---
I think it was the beginning of cata, or possibly legion, where people were saying bear tanks aren't viable. We still cleared content with bears, but as a healer there were **glaring** differences between a bear and a warrior with relative gear.
---
Except that 31/5/15 is still probably the best pvp/pve hybrid raiding build even late in vanilla. This goes back to what an earlier poster was talking about, that one of the interesting things about vanilla was that the painful respect caused players to have to compromise in their specs. 31/5/15 is a great spec for a casual raider who does OT duty in raids and loves to pvp all the way through the life of vanilla.
---
Its not blindly deffending. People have read over 500 treats about layering all comming up with simmulair solutions that turns out to be worce that what we are getting. People are open to new solutions but the rephrasing of the same solution isn't something new to work with.
---
Attendance counts quite high, its not hard to convince others when there is roles unfilled. It is also not likely at all that all pure dps classes will perform optimal
---
You forgot one that I like the most: the modern macros.
---
I really, really don't miss not having \\#showtooltip
---
Did some testing like you mentioned and with prebis it looks like 9% hit is probably your best bet. I couldnt find a strong dps increase with 11% hit. It felt like i had slightly less rage going for 11% hit compared to 9% with 2% more crit in comparison.
---
On another note after testing different builds with different gear i concluded that 2h slamspec (fury) is incredibly strong pre-raid BIS. Paired with windfury its about 20-25% stronger then  fury DW.
---
Curious to see if you ever manage to come up with that system you mentioned in your earlier reply, love to use it myself
---
For me, Black Lotus will always mean "Add 3 mana of a single color of your choice to your mana pool".
---
In Wow Classic beta, could you see the hp of enemy ? Or debuff duration of enemy ? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you couldn't back in the days.
---
Buy yourself a lap desk.
---
Why the downvotes? Seems like a healthy discussion to be had.
---
It’s popular opinion because immersion and economy are important to us, and Blizzard is risking/ruining them unnecessarily with layering.
---
We all love guys like Omar. They have passion for the game.
---
We just wish *they* were in charge, because clearly whoever is calling the shots right now doesn’t think immersion is important hence the current iteration of layering.
---
If you're the dungeon/raid leader then yes, play whatever you want. In my experience, ret(ards) never offheal and you need to remind them every 5 minutes to buff you. Holy paladins on the other hand, they are great.
---
Yes, the modern client is awesome. Really wish they'd even bring more of the UI improvements from live over. Particularly wish they'd bring the outfitter equivalent into Classic.
---
I am no fan of queues, my plan was toll roll on a medium size population server, before layering got announced.
---
Now I am just worried that if I roll on a high population server it will be queueless for the first month and then all of a sudden have a queue when layering is removed. Trying to avoid that l. Thanks
---
It's like league of legends when people say X champ isn't viable. Sure, 1/100 times you see that champ and they take over the game, but the other 99 eat shit.
---
I quit in Cata and the reason was frustration. We had cleared all existing raids on normal and wanted to do firelands on heroic.
---
First I was forced to spec DPS (as priest) because we had enough healers and healing wasn't the problem and then we wiped 4 hours on one encounter without any progress whatsoever because it would always enrage because we didn't have enough dps.
---
Only one of our DPS did enough damage. I, like most of the others weren't even close. And I had no clue how to improve other than "have better gear". I also found the dps-rotation to be very annoying to execute properly with tons of stupid gimmicks like black orbs and dot-timings etc. for the seemingly sole purpose of making the experience as annoying and convoluted as possible. :o
---
And all that for progressing in a raid that I had already cleared on a more managable difficulty. Nope, not motivating!
---
I came back for a month or two in a few of the subsequent add-ons. But I wouldn't really count that as playing again.
---
The weird thing is that I actually kinda liked Cata initially for being challenging again after I found wotlk way too easy for the most part. And then I quit because it was too hard. But I guess, if the "difficulty" is provided by an arbitrary enrage-timer and the only way to overcome it is not "play better" but "have better gear" it's a bit more excusable. :o
---
&gt; You want an excuse to be able to change the game in any stupid, horribly thought-out way Blizzard wants, under the guise "herp derp well it can't be 100% perfect anyways".
---
Have you ever heard of the term "strawman"?  
---
I want Classic to look, feel, and behave like Vanilla.  That inherently means #somechanges.  
---
IDGAF about blizzard and haven't since they sold out.  I very likely understand what Vanilla was more than 90% of this sub, and especially you lol.
---
&gt;was this changed?
---
nope.
---
there were plenty of free realm transfers though during vanilla.
---
hurr durr DAE activision BAD?!
---
Oh, OP. Silly, naive OP.
---
*Every* server is going to be a high pop server at launch.
---
Same for me, I'm basically looking forward to playing classes that I didn't back then and doing it rather casually.
---
I already did hardcore raiding back then, no need to go through that pain in the arse again.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM
---
It's called 'the paradox of choice'.  Generally speaking people are actually less happy with more choice.  Same goes for raids.  It's much easier to just know what you have to do to do a raid than wonder about different versions and all that bs
---
Still crying, mate you might need professional help if you're this upset about a lack of achievement.
---
At least they got Cenarius to defeat those Orc Invaders right? ....right?!
---
Well maybe everyone being in BIS changes that? All I know is there's a few in beta most notably Charles that really tear shit up in pvp.
---
The fact that your shoes are on is triggering me
---
When it started to feel like a chore and that the game was playing me instead of the other way around.
---
Yeah but you get the gist. To clarify: its Not an egoism Thing, im trying to find a relaxed sweetspot die my guild, where we still Talk about debuffs but Not restrict Them down to the 16th Slot.
---
Wouldnt U say that Allowing 5 Arms DPS to MS is More fun/productive than keeping Gift of arthas Up?
---
I agree, there are BIG debuffs in that categorie (Like ignite Nightfall u Said earlier)
---
That would be unfortunate but there arent a Lot of ignites going on in MC. Im Just looking for fun and Arms war Without MS doesnt Sound fun :( Being forced to spec Into a different spec isnt fun either (for mages / druids)
---
Hi, /u/Urinecakes
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cb1ffv/layering_in_2019/). 
---
Maybe it's a private server thing, but I have to come out and heal after one or two mobs that I kill in cat form. Being able to jump into a form with enough energy has been really nice and smooth (level 31 now on pserver). I rushed feline swift then went furor 5/5 and am going down feral to get feral faerie fire. Is omen that much better? I'm so conflicted haha
---
Yes I have I played on a PVP realm from the first day the game launched and my server never revolved around the battlegrounds after their newness wore off.
---
People were upset when they became cross-realm but the focus was always more on the server's world to begin with.
---
“I said we need dps, we already have a healer”
---
when is the next stress test? and how do we download the test server before the test starts so were not waiting around for it to download while the test is going on
---
They are rare and valueable. All spawn points will be camped.
---
If you are in bad luck, these spawn points will get camped by working together horde and alliances to establishe a monopoly on these plants. Making them the only seller and thus prices rise sky high.
---
This is called the black lotus mafia.
---
Ah yes, I recently learned this as well. Juggernauts!
---
I recommend you use the search.
---
Yeah that’s when I drink every last drop of that expensive asspipe level 45 water before I start healing. Sorry guys, was drinking...see in chat where it says, “oom, drinking” ? Yeah that means wait
---
I don't think so. OSRS is doing great.
---
Nope
---
Did you tell your guild/friends you were quitting?  I played with a guy from BC through late Wrath who turned 21 and I never heard from him again.  Asphar, is that you??
---
"Years and years of bad decisions". Why would they push and advertise classic as much as the live game? Classic had a limited player base with no growth potential like the live game does. Both games can exist simultaneously and have different player bases. It's not one or the other.
---
I have to point out that your complaint about talents applies way more to classic wow then modern.
---
... I'll try again. If you can't interact between layers, then when they merge, the majority of your server consists of complete strangers. That's what servers merges are and it's *the exact thing they're trying to avoid in the first place.*
---
With layering, I can interact with anyone on the server, even if they're in a different layer one hour, they might be on mine the next, or the next day. I might buy their stuff on the AH. I can see them speaking in general chat. They can join my guild, all of that regardless of what layer they're on at what time. The server is one whole community with *temporary* systems put in place to ensure that as people leave the server, it reduces the population to a desired size over time and they don't have to cart in 2000 more strangers to fill it up overnight *months* into the game's lifecycle.
---
Good point I guess?  How exactly does that tie back into anything?
---
&gt;I would rather they just dynamically spawn 1-20 zones the first few weeks and be done with it
---
That doesn't fix or even remotely touch the tourist issue they are trying to fix with layering.
---
By DD, of course, we meant human (or later Dranaei) females because they have the knockers.
---
But but #nochanges?!  Being able to auto loot is going to destroy the economy.  Inflation will skyrocket because of the faster loot times!
---
Even if they just increase the decay rate.
---
If your healer isn't a paladin then a ret pally is likely going to make it faster, not slower. Buffs, solid aoe damage, and backup healer and rezzer.
---
sometimes shit goes wrong, 
---
if your healer is a druid you don't have a rez, unless your 5th is a pally or shadow priest. 
---
If your tank or healer go down early in a fight a druid can jump in to any roll.  utility &gt; dps. (for the 5th)
---
There won't be plate dps players in groups where I'm tanking.
---
But, *why* do people like Ulduar?  I find it pretty bland and some bosses like the one with the kid voice so cringey.  Was it because it was "epic" with the vehicles and all?
---
I always thought raids like Black Temple were way cooler despite not having a few of the flashy elements.
---
Blizz devs: people really liked the immersion of classic  
---
Also Blizz devs: lets bring classic back without that pesky immersion
---
When vanilla initially launched the realms weren't overcrowded because anybody who wanted to log in when the server was at capacity had to wait in a log in queue to get in. Sometimes we waited for hours just to be able to sign in.
---
I quit during TBC, late 2007.  wasn't having fun, everything felt like a race against other guilds.  also internal guild drama with the reduced raiding sizes, people formed tight cliques and fought about who got tied to which instance for the week. i was so angry at blizzard for getting rid of the 40 man raid, everything was harmonious then.  First I stopped raiding to avoid drama, and just pvped and did solo things, but I found that the world just wasn't immersive like classic was... everything was set up to grind levels through it.. not to exist in it...   
---
hoping blizzard would take a step back towards classic i tried wotlk on a different realm. (leveled 1 to 80) but once i got to the new content (60 to 80) i just wasn't enjoying it. got my heroic gear and just cancelled again.
---
Sorry.  I'm not in college anymore.  I have 14 kids and 6 jobs now, of which I took the day off for all of them on launch day.  I can't afford to spend 12 minutes in a queue.
---
That's why we need layering.  Sorry you can't have your cool raids.
---
I played to like level 20 in vanilla but then picked up more in TBC and WOTLK.  I actually wound up buying a level 60 shaman to play with my RL friends in TBC and really enjoyed it.  Wound up wanting something new so I bought a 60 druid.   Loved it to pieces and was worried it'd get taken back by the owner (which it eventually did) so I actually stopped playing it and leveled my own druid up from level 1 and eventually leveled paladin, warrior, and several different DKs during wrath.  I did kara a handful of time in pugs during TBC and did a few bosses in Naxx pug during WOTLK but never had time to raid.  I ultimately quit towards the end of wrath because I ran out of stuff to do and hated all of the dailies and the fact that the only BG routinely done anymore seemed to be strand of the ancients, which I didn't like (though I did love how it opened a simple raid that I could pug afterwards which incentivized people to play it) and since I didn't have time to raid BGs were my only source of entertainment when I got tired of dungeons.  
---
When Cata came out I tried to go back and leveled my druid from 70 to 72 and then just never logged back in because the game just felt like it was moving further away from anything I was interested in and I've never played retail since.
---
As a holy priest I liked having rest in the group. Rogues take the most damage and are the most frustrating. Not their fault I guess but still sucks. Rest give out MP5 and can spot heal themselves
---
So I can only quest with my friends once a day? If I have to go for dinner and come back I'm locked out of questing with them? No.
---
They do that in retail but classic was "stand and wait" because you had to clear one mob at a time and unlike retail you will not survive if everything respawns on top of you.
---
Agreed if the hybrid is not a turd. In life on my end i assume everyone is a dipshit until proven otherwise
---
Therefore :
---
turd pure dps &gt; turd hybrid dps
---
Good pure dps &lt; good hybrid dps
---
Dal rends are one of the reason I stopped playing vanilla. I did more than 100 runs with my rogue and never got one or the other. Got it stolen from me MANY times.
---
&gt;layering has nothing to do with overcrowding 
---
&gt;&gt;layering and sharding are literally two different methods of balancing populations
---
“While leveling”   He said nothing about raiding, don’t misconstrue his words so you can be negative....so umm, good luck?
---
What you are thinking of will work *against* you.
---
If 3k pop is meant for each layer, at launch you should have 4-500 people in your starter zone.
---
If you somehow dip to 200 in your starter zone across each layer, *the game will merge layers until you have 400ish in each starting zone*.
---
Please read the blue post again. You’re understanding of layering is flawed. You think it’s like sharding which is meant to combat overpopulation. It’s not.
---
Read the blue post again man you’re gonna be worried when you finally understand it proper.
---
Super underrated! 
---
IT STINKS
---
RFD Pickpocket + Locked Chest runs. Kill bosses for blues.  BRD pickpocket. Rare recipe farming.
---
Mage finishes you with a wand. #feelsbadman
---
&gt;I haven’t played retail in weeks
---
found the garbage tier fan boy, how do you fuckers actually defend this shit?
---
I agree every server will be high population at launch, by design. That has nothing to do with my question.
---
I am challenging the idea that streamer servers will lose population and yet you offer nothing other than insults.
---
Thanks
---
I wish all these spergs could just go play on their own server and let us people with full time jobs have our fun occasionally running into these herbs on our journeys. Hoping I end up on a more casual server like I did in Vanilla.
---
You know this is a vanilla sub right
---
I think it will matter when you play that will effect your opinion of dungeons.  Early on, when nobody's geared, finding groups will be far more trivial.  If you got into a guild who's willing to help, finding groups for dungeons will be far more trivial.  The only people I've heard who complained about finding groups for dungeons in vanilla were people who got to 60 in late 2005 or 2006.
---
You have it backwards. Layering is to handle stress(overpopulation) on the servers at launch when there is a ton of people in one zone or area trying to do one quest. 
---
It will be removed some point after launch once the playerbase is dispersed around the game world
---
What sage advice that is interchangeable with literally every other hill.
---
I make friends, so this isn't an issue with me.  But people defending the indefensible is where my problem with it lies.  Everyone flimsily defends such nefarious actions with the easily refutable claim that forming a group or raid means the leader has earned automatic loot.  For 5 and 10 mans it means nothing, but in raids it usually ends in failure as one greedy fool tries to con 39 randoms to guarantee them a piece of gear.  Those raids often end in failure, souring the experience and preventing PUGs from happening in the future.  Or they clear to the specific boss and then people just stop giving a shit after the item doesn't drop and the raid falls apart.  
---
PUGs matter, and narcissists fucking it up to guarantee their eDicks grow with gear ruin the environment.
---
They are super comfortable. A lay-z-boy recliner... lap keyboard is more ergo, keeps your arms lower, below your heart, at 90 degree angles, on comfy recliner arms. Legs can be in many positions, straight down like computer chair or up in many angles, changing up over a long session is nice.
---
I'm a software dev. I sit in a super ergo work setup; those expensive comfy chair, height adjustable desk...all the goodies. Below is my gaming setup. Both are good, but I can sit way way longer in my gaming setup. Seriously, 40 hr gaming weekend binges are nothing for these setups. Playing 18 hrs a day, even after 7 days, it is still fine. Lack of sleep is the limiter, that's how comfy these setups are when done correctly. For me anyway, /shrug.
---
One of you should be a healing class. Even if it's not spec'ed healing it will help you move along a lot faster
---
I don't know what kind of people you are talking about but I think generally people understand, also can you give a source of the game merging servers dynamically because that's the first time I'm hearing about this and I don't think that's correct.
---
Frequency of log offs in actual Classic? Rare.
---
Frequency of people vanishing and suddenly reappearing in your world with layering? Increased 100x
---
“Invite to asmon layer” won’t even be the worst part. Worst part will be when you clear that cave and the game suddenly switches you to a layer with a full mob cave and you die.
---
Layer hopping is not needed.
---
&gt;I would lose my mind
---
Why though?
---
lmao what kind of answer even is this?
---
yes I know. And why does that mean that people cant say that MoP and Legion were great Xpacs?
---
Based on what I learned in stress test, it would be better if you grouped up with the same class as the class quests you get are quite tough for the level.
---
Then it's going to be a really good year for you with FF7 being remade to modern graphics.  This year or next year it releases.  Supposedly FFXV+ level graphics.  This is something I'm excited for as long as they don't completely ruin it and keep it true.
---
Who else here also thinks about MTG black lotus which sells for a f***ton of money ?
---
That was the one good thing about Draenor on release: no flying mounts meant wpvp had real potential.  wpvp was loads of fun for the first few months until everyone realized the expansion was crap.
---
download the twitch app, easiest way. U can just press download and they go to the right folder automatically.
---
I'm no expert but I would assume an option for increase camera distance would fall under the graphics settings considering the further back (more you see) the better graphics you would require.
---
That’s great...it’s the other inconvenience like farming CC rep, farming in general, pvp without MS. Sorta blows
---
I like the fact that players have a big influense on the economie, rivallary and the economie. Even tho its sucks to be on the short end sometimes.
---
I literally have no idea what you mean.
---
Also been at it 15 years but I have no need for a mouse pad. And yeh lap keyboard is so good!
---
Fiber in 2004-2005 ?? wow
---
I wish they did a hard PvP template where everyone had the same power, but you could choose your template (you get X amount of stat points to distribute in your secondaries, you want a haste build, a crit build, a balanced build, you get to choose), in feel like rated PvP, gear shouldn't matter, leave the noobstomping via massive gear advantage to BGs and WPvP.  I'd still play retail if I could just do rated 3's without worrying about gear.
---
Otherwise yeah, linking up the PvP season and the PvE content is just dumb, it either makes the PvP season way too long, or the PvE content is out for too little time to effectively be farmed before the next raid.  They need to be independent and irrelevant of each other.
---
I thought official numbers ran until a little into Draenor, which shows a massive drop in player counts 3-4 months after release.
---
Not bad at all actually. Especially being friends and leveling together. Once you do dungeons and items drops for you all it’s easier to get them then it would be with 4 randoms.
---
Sick setup!
---
not sure if classic will have its own app or site for those but at the moment i would say twitch.
---
I guess you've never leveled a profession before?  Run lowbies through dungeons?  Stand around in cities selling your cooldowns?  Ganked redridge for hours? Raid?
---
What are you even talking about "you can't go anywhere else in the world to do other things".  That's the most laughable statement in this whole thread, and there is a *lot* of laughable stuff here.
---
&gt; Lots of servers, vanilla-like population caps. Why is that so hard?
---
Maybe you should actually ask yourself that seriously.  If it wasn't hard, why wouldn't Blizzard do it?  How is it that Blizzard, the people who created the most successful MMO ever and have more experience running something like this than anybody else in the world, can't figure this simple stuff out that even you can??
---
One of my college roommates put his keyboard in his lap and used his thigh as a mousepad. We're now both adults with children and when I was at his place last I saw that he still has his computer setup for the same thing, it actually made me pretty happy to see.
---
Because it's entirely out of the realm of possibility that they try and cap starter zones and add more layers for the first 12 hours...
---
First and foremost, loot competition. If you're two warriors and a 2h axe drops, you both want it. And then if a cloth helm drops, neither of you want it.
---
Second, your weaknesses will stack up. 2x warriors still have no healing, no kiting, no crowd control etc. You're still both melee. I guess you can use the "taunt-&gt; hamstring -&gt; run as your friend DPSes" tactic but there are much more efficient ways of doing it.
---
Will it make it unplayable? Nope. Not any worse than being solo. So if you want to play as 2x warriors, by all means go for it. But other combos might work a lot better.
---
Yes of course, but that harkens exactly to my original post, which wasn't calling retail vanilla players shit, it's just that the overall meta and focus was a lot more relaxed back then compared to the modern vanilla meta on private servers, which should be a good indicator for what the meta could be like on Classic.   
---
Again this wasn't even talking about casual guilds per se, my brother and the other raiding warriors used that build throughout almost all of vanilla and his guild was at Cthun/early naxx progress near the end of the game (so not a casual guild, but not a great guild either), it just shows the difference in mentality.
---
Warcraft football tabletop game incoming! (Themed Bloodbowl?)
---
Except Shaman dps was good?
---
Until you realize, load balancing isn’t the point of layering.
---
There’s no reason not to do the same thing they did in 2004. Because, you know, that’s the point. Letting player self select layer until they are full and move on.
---
Well if you enjoy gearing while leveling it is a good way to play. For some people reaching 60 the fastest way possible is not the only definition of a "good way to play". Also as warlock or shadow priest it makes a world of a difference in how fest you level if you have the full shadow weave set or just some random greens...
---
Sweet thanks, quick follow up question. Are there specific add ons that are for classic on there? It has to do with the version of wow right? So 1.12 or what ever.
---
1 DPS sounds like something a ret could do...
---
yeah this makes zero sense i hope ur joking
---
you can auto loot in classic the only difference was having to hold shift when you click the corpse
---
First time I went below 200 was in wrath...
---
Then what is the point of layering enlightened one? To ruin the game bc blizzard secretly wants classic to fail?
---
blizzlike LUL
---
I think you need something to place the keyboard and mouse properly on, to be honest. Also, where do you put your cup of coffee/tea?
---
That was my initial interpretation, but the sentiment in this sub seems to have shifted to preventing dead servers.
---
Either way, it will play out the same and I am wondering what people's opinions on if it is even feasible for blizzard to remove it from a server that doesn't lose enough population
---
The only thing more pathetic than the fans who desperately try to get a streamer's attention and showering them in trade spams are the "anti-fans" who watch their every movement on social media to stalk them with hate-boners. Gaze into the abyss, and the abyss gazes back.
---
You'll be fine - might not be able to do 5 man quests without a healer but that doesn't matter - play what y'all want and have fun leveling!
---
I like holy with wand and tap talents until 40 to go shadow form.
---
I'm gonna need a source for these conspiracy theories
---
I'm okay with anything from 400 to 40,000
---
I think it also depends on which style of gamer you are.  Some people really enjoy games where optimization is important, like Factorio, where the reward isn't just doing the thing but doing it efficiently.  It can be fun to clear the quests of a zone in vanilla efficiently and 'conquer' it so to speak.  It's the same mentality as speedrunning just less sperg.
---
wat, layering is literally about dynamically adjusting the pop based on demand, in real time
---
&gt; You are STILL gonna have 500 people in your starting zone with you on launch.   
---
&gt; Layerings target pop per layer is 3k. 
---
So without layering and queues and with server online of, say, 9k, we'd have 1500 people in a starting zone? I see a bit of difference between numbers 500 and 1500.
---
 I am sure there is a safe space layer.
---
+1 for opposite faction.  That is definitely a scenario in which you have no way of guaranteeing that you get ganked by the same person on multiple play sessions (which I do legitimately think is important to the game).  
---
IDK if layering will be gone before people reach popular contested territories in their 30s-40s.
---
1 dps seems a bit high for a ret pally.
---
Josh Allen is a tool and never respected the Wow community to begin with
---
This sums it up.
---
I still have my Spectral Tiger card I got back in BC. Here's hoping if they Co tinue to a bc server etc I can redeem it again there or bring my tabards over.
---
&gt; layering fixes overcrowding
---
Facepalm.gif
---
You actually still think layering is meant for overcrowding. Jesus, we are fucked. 
---
Please re-read the Blizzard blue post. Just check it again, give it a quick scan.
---
The layering system targets 3k online. That’s about 4-500 per starting zone. 
---
The layering system will aim to keep that target no matter what. **Your starting zone having 400 people chasing one boar is the very goal of layering**.
---
Never said it wasn't...in fact, I said the opposite in my last comment.
---
And Swifty
---
Far less meme than dagger rogue. Especially if you're talking raid wide threat limit increase. 
---
Fully admit though for dps, orc or human is way to go. Just like sword is way to go for rogue.
---
Ah I see where you're going now. I just get frustrated with people writing off vanilla players as terrible across the board simply because they were 12 and bad when vanilla was live (not saying this describes you). I misunderstood you and decided to springboard off into my own personal crusade, my mistake.
---
Ah yes, the "immersion" of not being able to quest at all because there's 1000 people in the same zone fighting over the same mobs.
---
Home...
---
Youre just trolling. I’ve raided with nightfall hunters, their uptime is far better. The dps loss is less than if you had your OT or a ret paladin doing it. Idk why you act like people haven’t just tested this. Nightfall hunter has been a thing for years
---
I know that you are not 5, but 3, but tjek out the cleave group guide, having more of the same class is not really a problem :) 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrJ56pzDExc&amp;t=881s
---
I think you highly overestimate the impact streamers will have on long term population. Most people aren't fanboys.
---
I would actually be ok with this.
---
lol!!! Prot warrior is RL/GL or his buddy and you need 1, maybe 2. Whereas there’s lots of DPS slots.
---
rogue can reset, warrior can't
---
Thank you for proving my point about people not understanding what wow vanilla was all about.
---
Partially true. Regardless of the layering tech existing, they still want to target 3k pops and avoid server merges, right? Which means they need *big* servers that shrink over time. If they took out layering you'd have more like 1600 people in Northshire which would be totally unplayable, even with a system like dynamic respawning. In that instance you'd have to use zone-by-zone sharding which, as we know, no-one wants, because then each zone would feel underpopulated instantly.
---
well not in real time, you are supposed to stay on the same layer and also always on the same server with people from the same server, you should never see people from other server unless in cross-realm bg which was confirmed
---
If you roll on one of their servers I hope you enjoy seeing "Lf InViTe tO AzmOnGolD lAyEr" spammed nonstop.
---
I was thinking about the same thing, but if you suggest anything that is a good technical solution, regardless of that you will be massively downvoted. This subreddit can be really shit at times...
---
They were on Mal'Ganis right? I'm pretty sure Elitist Jerks was on that server as well.
---
You may be able to trade taunts and get time to bandage between your warriors while your rogue goes all out.  a healer will be more helpful but it’s completely fine that you run those 3 classes.  Worst thing is you’ll want to run a dungeon a couple extra times to gear both warriors.  In the end you’ll all be happier rolling what classes you want rather than one of you  play a healer you don’t want to play.  Also enh shaman would rock in your group with a rogue and warriors, just sayin.
---
What specs, if you are running Windows XP it might just be the OS holding you back..
---
I don’t and I don’t.
---
Hunter gear!
---
in Vanilla I always did dungeons with my ret pala friend.
---
Often I would get aggro, CCed or some BS. Then he would help me - casting a few heals to help. Think it worked quite well back then.
---
I am well aware. But you said you would run around in the same area, so I didn’t assume you would be login in and out all the time. Might point being that for as long as you are online you should see pretty much the same people, and even with relogging you are not that unlucky to be sharing layers with the same people in the future especially if you added them to your friend list.
---
Does it bother me? No. And sure, it doesnt make everything Blizzard does defensible. I'm not saying it does. But the reality is that Classic is potentially in good hands (we've seen recent action that seems to back this up as well). But fuck this entitled, "I know best" mentality some of this sub has.
---
Not having to hold shift will ruin the economy!  #nochanges!
---
You know what the real comfort improvement is? 15 years of internet infrastructure developments and ready made cheap gaming PC’s. Even if everything was the same and no one knew anything about classic wow, it would still be easier by virtue of not being a laggy hot mess.
---
I literally couldn’t turn in the onxyia head one time because there were too many people in orgrimmar and my guild was fucking mad and the other guile’s waiting for the buff were also mad. I did eventually get it but it basically took half an hour to get to the turn in spot from my bank. Crazy.
---
Loot trading within 2 hours will have a much bigger effect on rolling in pugs groups than we can think of. Incoming rolling gear loots for your friends. Let's hope this doesn't make it to live.
---
I can't say no to another commercial with Mr. T :)
---
I quit just before TBC came out, and came back for Wrath. I had a lot of fun in Wrath, and was really excited for LFG.
---
I played with LFG for about a week, and wasn't really having fun anymore.
---
I came back in Legion, leveled a couple of characters. I collected some transmog, and tried to play the AH for a while. I eventually let me sub lapse again.
---
Classic is the game that I've been wanting to play for years. I can't wait to go back to the Azeroth I loved.
---
Not really though. What you are thinking of is sharding: where people from different servers are brought into the same zone together to make up for the low population on those individual servers.
---
Layering is taking a very high population on one server and separating them into different layers within that server, which reduces load on the servers and actually let's you kill some mobs without everything being stolen or tagged before you can get it.
---
Layering will be removed shortly after launch. Sharding has been confirmed to not be in the game. 
---
Layering does absolutely nothing for low pop servers. Only hope would be a merge of some sort in the future. Remains to be seen though
---
there's a lot of people.  way too many
---
like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cb1bdr/can_layering_be_removed_on_high_population_servers/etcdbdy/?st=jxvwp26m&amp;sh=e2154d79) in the other layering thread from just a min ago
---
pretty much in every thread about layering
---
boomkin/ele/spriest are perfectly fine in 5mans, it's in raids where they tend to have issues because they OOM super fast.
---
Just watching stream interview, and that's what a dude said who got  to 60 in 5 days.
---
Most slowest to level:
---
- Warrior
---
- Rogue
---
- Pala
---
You're also completely missing the point that in developed countries we had good ping in 2005 as well. Just because 28k modems might have been a thing in redneck USA doesn't mean Europe suffered. We've had ADSL since 2000 and a few megabits was standard by the time WoW released.
---
You can just get illumination in holy and put the rest in retribution and boom, you can now go farm and do decent damage while still being able to heal raids. All you do is switch some gear.
---
Basing your entire class choice around a few (that aren’t even hard) class quests is completely bogus.
---
Good damnit I was all set to roll druid but now i'm like "Oh hey how about a priest????"
---
But you can have warriors do damage without trash debuffs lowering casters dps.
---
If your raid is fine with everyone throwing up trash debuffs and lowering the raid dps.  *Shrug*
---
People like you is why WoW is absolute trash today
---
Stoped playing early in Wotlk because I was finished with the content offered at release in no time and had nothing else to do. It also started to get boring.
---
Went back for two months with BfA, played a character from 1 to 120, had more fun than expected while doing so. Tho, the shitty M+ system and otherwise non relevant end content - except doing the same raid over and over - drove me away pretty fast.
---
You have itemization.info that tell you the exact patch any item was implemented. Then 1.1 and 1.2 is P1, 1.3 and 1.4 is P2, etc.
---
Oh look another layering post. I’m sure this one has deep insights, thoughtful analysis, and viable alternatives.
---
WWII Online solved this problem. You cannot switch sides there, based on how overcrowded the other side is. To translate that to WoW, upon login, there is a recommended layer. You can log in immediately on that one. The overcrowded layers will require like 40 seconds waiting and then you can spawn into them. You could see highly populated layers or low pop layers. After you log out based on the population again, you can choose one. You want to play with your friends? Organize which layer you take, then spawn in. You enjoy crowds and you like to camp for 2 hours to do a 10 kill mob quest in Darkshore? Sure thing, no problem mate, wait the 40 seconds queue and log in! Or log in immediately on the low pop layer.
---
Wanna farm stuff? Straight to the lowest pop layer!
---
Having automated and immediate layer transmission upon invite is just stupid.
---
And dynamic respawns is more immersion breaking for the casual gamer, changes the entire dynamic for how to level efficiently and it can easily be abused as well.
---
Troll Berserking is best for PVE and shadowguard is great in PVP.  
---
Literally though, it's min/maxing. Yes a Troll priest will do more DPS/HPS with berserking but I do not think it's really much. It mostly comes down to lore/aesthetics/starting Zone(if leveling with friends).  
---
Do you want kamehameha casting or the metal "horns"? Do you want to do capoeira or headbang/fist pump? Mohawk or missing jaw?   
---
Bottom line, Min/Max = Troll
---
Here's what you're not understanding. You say your solution nearly mirrors the 2004 experience.
---
Yes, you're right. That's why they're intentionally *not* doing it. Because this is an instance where they don't want to mirror the 2004 experience. The 2004 experience leads to dead servers and the need for server merges. They don't want to do that.
---
Majority of people had good ping back then too. So it's not changing the gameplay from 2006 if the batch window is identical.
---
what I imagine of real time is people popping in and out of you layer in front of you which should not happen I know it does on beta sometimes but it shouldnt at least that's what was said by the devs and I only asked about what op said about the game merging servers dynamically which as I said should never ever happen
---
Hm, maybe i should reconsider. How much % less dmg would i Deal When not using MS?
---
Unfortunately I had to pack most of the tribes - those are hostile to Alliance and Horde alike - into "Bad tribe". I don't mention Northrend trolls there, because I am not sure if the technology allows them to travel that far. But I guess I'll change it since I am not sure it doesn't :)
---
If you choose "Bad tribe", you'll also have to deal with the addon suggesting that you might've fought in Gurubashi war (as if you're from Gurubashi/Skullsplinter/Bloodscalp tribe) and in Second War (as if you're from Amani/Vilebranch/Witherbark tribe).
---
Personaly. I think level 1-10 is the hardest on every class. Warrior is just very gear dependant. After you get shinies from Wailing Caverns, everything comes much easier. I think its the most rewarding class to play and has the most awesome looking gear.
---
Wind fury Totem alone is enough to justify bringing along an enh shammy
---
Don't bother, it's about their kid together, that can see dead people.
---
I believe so, we access the client and create chars to reserve the name, but can't enter the world I would imagine
---
Worth is defined by sale. You can't say they aren't worth $5 if people are buying them for $5.
---
Getting stomped by higher level players is a rite of passage on pvp servers. Embrace it and let it fuel your future hatred of the other faction!
---
You are lowering significantly lowering all the casters dps.  That's why.
---
I would then leave for a different guild :)
---
get out of my forest green skins
---
I was EU and still unplayable during most times.  
---
Dynamic respawn is shit for the game and thats a known fact
---
This is how I was planning on doing it for the reason you stated. I’m figuring I’m rolling warrior and will get ganked a whole lot less when more people are racing to 60. I think the first wave of 60s could definitely get bored waiting on more people to run content with.
---
What choice? In wrath you could do both the 10 and 25 version of each raid. Having to choose between the two was introduced in cata.
---
Since running both versions helped gear up the raid faster, you naturally did both versions every week, which also caused people to burn out twice as quickly.
---
So they will have the same server caps as they did in vanilla you think? That would solve the issue I am imagining.
---
I'm talking about leveling up and to a lesser extent prebis dungeons.   Warriors (and bears and pallys for that matter just to a lesser extent) that flat out refuse to tank in dungeons.  You can tank all those dungeons in whatever spec you want/already are.
---
lol, 
---
&gt; Far less meme than dagger rogue.
---
Thats not even close to right.
---
Daggers are better in the possession of an equally skilled rogue than an equally skilled warrior, and it isnt even close. To the point where a good rogue wtih daggers can keep up/out dps a warror with full bis. Granted, they arent equally skilled at that point, but Im still talking a GOOD warrior vs a great rogue basically, so the gap in skill isnt gigantic.
---
So sorry, meme spec wise, a warrior with daggers is a LOT more meme than a... rogue... I cant believe you even typed that, and I retyped that.
---
Go ask any player from vanilla if a rogue with daggers is meme. And please be warned, youre going to be laughed at.
---
You only need 21 points in holy to be an awesome raid/PvP healer. The rest of the points you can dump into ret or prot as you see fit.  As with any hybrid class you’ll cary around different sets of gear depending on your chosen roll. But ret isn’t a powerhouse dos spec so no mater what it’ll be slow killing when compared to the pure dps classes, but hey you’ll never die!
---
From what I read on the 13th of August we get to make our characters. So my interpretation means full make just cant enter
---
I have to go watch the many whelps video now.  Been to many years...
---
Just call them out in private.  They need to know that they're doing something wrong, that you know about it, and that they need to stop doing it, but if you call them out mid-raid over comms and publicly shame someone that's bad juju and leads to resentment and drama.
---
Pretty sure we know the answers. Hop off Blizzard's dick for a second and maybe you'd know them too.
---
Good times one week before BWL release where the server was so overcrowded that flask of titans peaked at 265g each.
---
There won't be "lots" of them killing lowbies, but there doesn't need to be. Just one can easily shut down an entire section like the beach of STV.  
---
As to whether or not you "should" nobody can answer that for you.
---
To combat the likely drop off of the tourist players blizzard would likely do high pop x2 or x3 for every server so that would likely still be an issue then.
---
What aoe damage does a ret bring exactly? I only remember concencration.
---
You are aware that you are talking about WoW here? A game that always had a lot of humour.
---
Warrior Tank here. You don't need Hand of Justice. You don't need threat gen that early in the endgame scene.
---
Okay I hope that’s true. Really need to see my name underneath a couple races
---
Thank you! Any lore suggestions are welcome btw. I might've missed a lot, I might've made some mistakes, I might've not paid enough attention to certain aspects.
---
It is kinda lame imo.
---
I think mc loot will be updated and not similar to the original wow because it was dropping T1 AND T2 at that time. Then they deleted t2 and added off piece. That being said, for every other items, they will be release on the phase that match their original patch of implementation, but in their 1.12 state. Exemple : all the catch up blue gear implemented in Dongeon loot table in 1.10 will arrive in P5.
---
&gt;Not my **feelings** but the **feel** of combat
---
Thanks for capsing it &lt;3
---
Fucking mint.
---
Idk. I am not a warrior so i am the wrong guy to do the math.  
---
In my raid you wouldnt be allowed to use MS and if you can't keep up with the other warriors you get put on the bench.  Good luck finding a raid that does allow this
---
We don't know, but I'd imagine since it's tied to your account anyway, it won't really matter. Whenever you log in to actually play just quickly delete the character and make the new one. Chances of someone snatching the exact same name in that time is miniscule.
---
The reservation process seems to be so that the people who have trouble accessing the servers the moment they launch don't have an unfair advantage when it comes to snagging the name they want - for this reason I'm going to guess the reservation is actually done outside of the client, *or* there's a special new interface within it solely for choosing a server and some names.
---
this is exactly what happens, while i am waiting for classic to release im playing Black Desert on the xbox. there is one world with 5-6 realms and each has 3 layers. when you log in you choose a layer and play on that one until you decide to switch to another layer at will. Guilds have preferred layers and generally stick to them. I started playing on the PVP layer but nobody from my guild plays on this layer. often when world bosses spawn people layer hop for more chances at loot etc. or layer hop to avoid pvp
---
I mean there's good reason for that, for the most part.   Blizzard, for a loooong time, had every chance to acknowledge the vanilla community, but they positioned themselves as a road block.  It's only recently (last two years) since they announced Classic that they've shown the vanilla community any respect.  Even now though, just as they were winning back respect, they want to add like layering, which implies either they still don't "get it" or don't care enough.
---
How many times can you expect Blizzard to ruin the games we love, ignore us, disrespect us, condescend us, and give us false promises before we lose all respect for them and their supporters?
---
Loot Drops to look out for: Any BOE Blue or Purple, keep to AH later (only if it's not a serious upgrade).
---
Wowhead is the go-to
---
Classic has nothing to do with BFA. They announced Classic in 2017 at the same time as BFA not after.
---
Narrator; It did not
---
Pally lacks a taunt and threat in vanilla mattered
---
heckin good show
---
Has this scenario been tested or are you just assuming it can be traded to someone who wasn’t in the group when it dropped?
---
Every server/layer will have 500 people in Northshire at launch, what it is there to prevent is 5000 players being there at launch on specific servers that streamers or popular guilds choose.
---
If you want, I can invite you to my fantasy-land, where they give us TBC and WotLK with minor tweaks that would uphold the "classic" values (no LFD/LFR, not flying mounts, no daily quests, etc.), and after that trilogy is done - go off into Classic+ with new content.
---
100% useless.
---
Fact
---
&gt; Loot Trade in Raids
---
Dude, they can’t taunt.
---
I was talking specifically about pve where shadow guard has no use
---
Meh its not too worrisome to me since it's not like all 40 people are able to roll on every item. You will still master loot in raids and if a rogue rolls a 99 on mage tier obviously you shouldn't give it to him. The amount of people you will need to roll against will remain largely unchanged.
---
That it's not needed doesn't mean that Blizz wont do it, and that's why you see players on here saying it's fine for X levels or in X zones or for X times, while Blizzard is doing the opposite by expanding from "just the starting zones" to "phase 1" to god knows how long.
---
Just hoping that Classic wont make the same mistakes all over again. Retail wasn't exactly fun with its player-splitting mechanics, as a returning player it was a damn hassle playing with friends with "you're not in the same phase so you're invisible" and "you're not equally PvP flagged so you're invisible".
---
That's the kind of 4th wall breaking bullshit that constantly reminds you that what you do doesn't mean jack shit and you're just running along in the hamster wheel. The vanilla what-you-see-is-what-you-get feel trumps it every day of the week.
---
Yes, those are two different things.

---
Except, y'know, boss fights and such may have been balanced with that technical limitation in mind. If you remove the debuff limit, you get more dps, you get boss fights that are easier than intended. You can't change one thing like that without upsetting a bunch of other things.
---
I never said I want the convenience of retail but I do want the server stability, accessibility and game play quality of retail as this is what has become expected of game manufacturers. As for you complaining about immersion breaking and community breaking nothing would be worse than taking a community of 3000 players and jamming it together with a second community of 3000 players that have never had contact with each other and expecting it to work well and then having to do it again every 2 months, think about the impacts on those guilds, the AH, balance of power, faction and class balance etc. And this is what you want.......think about it for 2 seconds. 
---
You could go from being on an alliance prominent PVP server and rolling there for that reason to a horde over run server in one set of server mergers. You think those players will be happy......EXACTLY.
---
So everyone who forms a dungeon group with an item reservation is a narcissist?  Dude, you're delusional.  Not even gonna waste my time.
---
Same. If it's your first character you really don't know any better. I rolled a warrior in WoW classic back in the day when I was like 15. You just kind of think "oh, this is just how the game is."
---
That's jsut it, there is no really good lvl 40 2h weapon, except for Pendulum of Doom. If that Charles got that, then he can wreck a bit, yes. But this is a mega rare drop.
---
From what I saw in the duel tournament, rets looked pretty helpless. A major factor being that other classes 31 point talents are much stronger than rets and they were missing both the talent to increase freedom duration as well as cleanse to dispel magic effects, so they could be kited quite easily.
---
I quit during Cataclysm.  It became increasingly hard to maintain a stable raid group with people happy to just do LFR.  Raids themselves became more arcadey and not really fun.
---
And they also ruined Hunters by removing our mana and replacing it with that focus bullshit.
---
Play what you want. Be 5 warriors if thats what you all want. No down time since you Will aggro bounce and kill fast.
---
He understands layering correctly and is just asking if it even will be possible to remove layering from high populated servers, because even after the initial rush the high populated streamer servers will still have a lot more population than other severs so removing layering from servers like that might still cause them tohave ques and such
---
sitting on your ass playing computer games for hours on end is not healthy period, no matter how ergonomic it is
---
As a warrior i'd rather take another warrior than a ret pally
---
There may be those people, but there will also be people on your faction hungry for blood.
---
All in the game, baby.
---
classic is already included on twitch, you can download addons directly into the classic addon folder as well.
---
ToC was definitely not a good raid but I'm surprise to see it get so much hate these days.
---
I suppose part of the issue is that it followed on of the best raids we've ever been graced with, Ulduar.
---
which wont be available phase 1 :(
---
That’s no lotus
---
What's layering for then? Enlighten us.
---
It's just consecration but that's enough. Especially if the paladin is gearing with spell damage plate, then they've got some pretty serious 5-man dps. Basically they're great when they can aoe, mediocre when they can't.
---
This is why if anyone's planning on taking time off to play classic, DONT do it on release day.
---
My ideal situation would be a server that caps playtime at 20 hours a week or so. People who want to no-life a game, perennially camp spawns, form mafias and manipulate the economy make it less fun for everyone IMO.
---
500 people in your starting zone is better than 3,000.
---
I hope it helps with the immersion. Voice intro on character creation is nice but lacks depth. Then one may find himself just slaying pixels without understanding which are actually important (like, Burning Blade cultists, Theramore marines, Defias bandits aren't just there to be bad things that give XP).
---
As someone who plays both, there seems to be more shaman dps than paladin dps. Shaman have 2 dps specs while pally's only have ret. Honestly though, both are pretty unpopular. You usually only run into them during lower level dungeons since it's not optimal to spec into healing while leveling.
---
&gt;Dire Maul exists
---
I'll stick to calling it VC thanks
---
For sure it would to ppl within the raid only
---
technically people could still fade in and out of existence in front of you if a layer happens to be created / removed at that moment, even if layers are continent wide it's still the same phenomenon as sharding
---
I think they're talking about things like rings ect. A bunch of buddies that are all casters but have a ring and then roll for their friend to get it.
---
Honestly I don't think it's that big of a deal, there's no need to pug raids in classic and if you refuse to join a guild, this is a minor risk you face.
---
Looks super cool!
---
Right its not dead, they choose not to show subscriber count because why not?!
---
Don’t kid yourself, WoW is 100% killing itself with shitty design philosophy. The new game is a theme park and some will stick around - but its never going to thrive like it used too.
---
To late for me, ive taken 6 weeks of starting the day before launch :)
---
Layering was designed to address the issues with server mergers a few months after launch. 
---
Sure it helps with overcrowding at launch, but that’s not really its intended purpose.
---
Oof, super casual, wonder why you think Ferals are viable.
---
Agreed. Trying to find a guild that raids in the morning/afternoon is a nightmare with these 6+ paragraph recruitment posts. Especially when the only mention of the time is hidden down in the middle of the 4th paragraph with just a sentence that says *"Prime time."*
---
I've chosen my current guild out of sheer burnout looking for the right one.
---
The poster specifically mention /stand. Reading comprehension on this sub is terrible
---
I played like this for years no problem. It’s hard finding a nice chair with flat arms so the mouse doesn’t slide off if you let go for a sec. I would game like this if I could find the right chair.
---
Tbh it's way more important for bear than cat.  No one is going to complain about losing some kitty auto attack dps.  The burst threat from the extra mauls is fucking bananas though.  Usually only need 1 charge per boss if it doesn't have extra phases with threat resets.
---
I'm not sure I'd call modern macros a comfort feature, they're functionally very different to the point they change gameplay.
---
Unless they fixed Mouseover kick/blind (which according to that spreadsheet of Classic bugs, they haven't) its a big deal not just some QoL
---
Resto doesn't go deep feral and as such doesn't get Heart of the Wild.  In fights where spam dispels are needed cat druids are typically asked to put their resto gear on and dispelbot.  HotW means they have a ton more int and are vastly better in that role than any other druid spec.  
---
In regards to offtanking, the tank and cat spec are basically the same.  If you are flex tanking you can shift back into cat and resume dps when not getting hit.  It's not that complicated.  Also, Bear is objectively the best threat build if you assume no thunderfury, especially early on (like for the first year or more of classic).  Fury/Prot literally cannot keep up while maintaining similar avoidance, even with WF totem handholding, when pre-bis.  MCP is just too fucking strong and even without it Fury/Prot is going to get creamed in pre-bis and a Bear won't.  Miss me with the inevitable "muh crit/crush" too.
---
If you personally don't want to raid with druids playing feral that's up to you but you are missing out on cool people doing cool things in your raid that are going to keep things fresh and interesting for you.  Maybe the first character you max and do raids on you'll force yourself into a min/max guild but if you keep playing you'll eventually realize that variety is what makes vanilla special.
---
Likewise, but I’m in US client.

---
It's still a good increase to your DPS while farming. With a holy pally you AoE farm with concencration. Your kill speed is slow but with JoLight and JoWisdom you have 0 downtime. Just always have 3-4 things beating on you with a shield on and the constant extra swings really adds up. Plus, you just can't die, hell you can go semi afk and keep up speed.
---
Sure, I guess I can see that to some extent, provided it actually feels better to play, and not just that the numbers get bigger.
---
An example of this would be reaching the haste breakpoint in nighthold as a frost mage to allow you to double lance, which drastically changed your playstyle and rewarded you for doing so. Meanwhile in classic, that doesn’t really exist, as you'll still be pressing frostbolt just the same in preraid gear as in bwl gear, and this generally applies to most classes, except maybe warriors, as they get more rage to spend with better gear.
---
Ion Hazzikostas played since Vanilla.

Yeah I know, I just thought it was like that for the beta before because I didnt realize it was in the launcher. Which is what started this reply thread..

Haha it’s always time for a rewatch 😜
---
You'll want to be 60 before Phase 2 hits, because at that point you become a worthwhile kill for honor. Since the first Battlegrounds aren't until Phase 3, you become the *only* way to get honor.
---
Phase 2 is going to be *rough* for sub-60s. Phase 3 will come as a relief to them.
---
Ganking isn't half as bad as these carebears make it out to be.
---
If you are in an area where someone is ganking you just move to a different spot.  If you stay in the same area while someone is ganking you then that's your fault
---
I'll just say I don't necessarily disagree with your opinions on predatory business practices, but I didn't take issue with that. I was talking about the dismissive attitude to folks who like what they like. You just asked if I thought something is worth some value then answered in your own feelings. Then you criticized the value others place on things based on your own values. Your personal opinion is no more right or wrong than mine or any other, but value is all based on the individual. When it comes to WoW I don't buy from the shop, but in games like R6S I've bought plenty of cosmetics because I enjoy the hell out of the game and can afford the charges for the fun cosmetics.

All they needed to do was add fixed layers so there is no layer hoping and boom problem solved, not hard is it.
---
Do whatever you want, but if any of you is even slightly interested in playing a class with a healing spec, that would be optimal. 
---
To already have a tank and a healer would mean you would be able to save so much time doing dungeons. Plus be able to split the loot better.
---
However, I am rolling a priest, and nobody is telling me any different. Regardless of if my friends wanted to play and wanted me to play a different class
---
Wrath was the beginning of the loot queue design attitude, when tanking was nerfed and dungeons became faceroll. What i liked about wow was that the dungeons required strategy, which this change noticeably removed from the game. Other things like server reputation,  player etiquette, noninstanced world difficulty all suffered from it.
---
But there have already been demonstratively proven instances of this happening. Person A was part of some world chat/start-zone antics on stress test weekend, left the populated fun for a quick run to town and then came back to all his chatting buddies gone.
---
Yes.  Anyone who forms a group to eliminate competition has only their own best interest at heart, and cares nothing for the success of the run or the quality of the group.  Which, is, very much narcissism.  If you want a specific item then get friends to run it with you and help you.  You know, that whole quid pro quo.  That, however, is not the case with the majority of instances where items are reserved.  
---
Not going to waste time is what every befuddled fool says when they can't counter.  Congratulations.
---
People actually thinking 9% more Parry makes tanks drop dead instantly are the funniest. Classic is also proven to have mobs do much lower damage than private servers. You didnt mention that though, because it doesnt help you pain the picture of private servers as buggy funservers.

&gt; we’ve been inundated by so many retail players/blizzard white knights who blindly defend layering 
---
Way to make assumptions. What about the people that are simply optimists and want to look on the bright side?   
---
&gt; You should be prompted to select layer after picking server, and then you get locked to that layer. Just like you got locked to a server in 2004. 
---
This is just as horrible idea as multiple servers with future merging. 
---
**Pwnmaster**: "Hey Billy, i'm on 'Illidan' but make sure you choose 'Layer X'. Oh, 'Layer X' is full? Guess we can't play together".

---
**Pwnmaster**: "Hey Billy, we can finally play together. Wait? Why is your name Mark now? Oh, there were 3 other Billy's across the other Layers and you were forced to change your name because you logged in after the first Billy? Bummer."
---
The whole point of the 20 hour cap is to level the playing field for everyone. Obviously some people wouldn't want to play on such a server.
---
Lol I wasn’t being exact. I’m just talking about visualizing my name with the race to help me make my decision
---
Also modern raid frames, which can also be used in party. It includes easy tracking of debuffs by type on group members. I'm not sure if the predictive healing from other healers is included...
---
About the modern addon API, does anyone know if threat is included in that? If so, that's a fairly big deal. Traditionally, threat addons had to "guess" threat values, and they were on occasion wrong.
---

That was one of our kills, 3rd is horde guild, later merged with death n taxes.
---
The point is that classic is not perfect. Trying to make it perfect is why retail wow is trash.
---
Something being possible does not by itself mean it is viable.
---
&gt;There is a vocal minority who yell very loudly that they want an unchanged MC, although they get quiet fast when you ask them if they want it to be so easy it is cleared in minutes. I think these are pirate server players who deep down don't want Classic to be a good game or to be challenging in any way, they see it only as a vehicle to validate their pirate server play with an easy win on Classic retail.
---
"Everyone who doesnt agree with me must be some kind of evil pirate who only want easymode because I am incapable of making actual arguments"
---
Stupid knows no bounds it seems.
---
I don't understand then. Should OPs situation not be an issue. Just add friends as group and play together.
---
He has no real arguement to defend 5K players starting the game at the same time on the same server in the same area so that's what hes resorting too.
---
That’s because mmos are dead.
---
Classic is the last chance to revive it
---
They are adding something similar in classic for release so that might work.
---
I'll thank you all when we get TBC servers instead of this second rate version of WoW.
---
At least its better than retail.
---
By gods we were patient then.
---
It's not ideal because of loot competition, and TBH the 3rd class being rogue is one of the worst pairings WRT class composition. In terms of questing, you guys won't have issues plowing through non elite quests. But your group has almost no utility (think warlock summon, mage food/drink+portals, druid buffs, etc.), you have no healer. That's going to make elite quests more difficult (not impossible), and its going to make finding a healer your bottleneck for every instance group.
---
Now compare your W/W/R threesome with a Warrior / Shaman / Rogue, or Warrior / Warrior / Druid, or Warrior / Shaman / Mage. When you replace 1 of the Warriors or rogue (or both) with a class that brings heals or more utility it makes the trio a lot more convenient.
---
But your trios comp makes leveling more difficult, it doesnt make it impossible. You have a MT which is one of the 2 big hurdles of organizing a group. You have coordination and communication which helps an awful lot. And you have eachother, which may be a pro or a con depending on your friends.
---
Tell that to warriors trying to solo the cyclonian in their mid 30’s XD
---
Hey, yeah that's pretty much what we expected I guess. I continued working with the program and got pretty far, but stuff like flurrys and procs didn't really work with the structure and I'd have to redesign some stuff in order for it to work. There is one already, not so user-friendly though. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0K52-VEkRDTeWI3U3V2LTVVYUk
---
I think in order for it to work you'll have to use microsoft excel, I'm not sure.
---
Fucking this. One of my biggest annoyances with the 1.12 client is not being able to see tooltips / cooldown timers on hotbar'd macros.
---
&gt; pservers have some of the most toxic gamers on the internet so hopefully layering isn’t touched and these kids don’t play
---
Something tells me you've never played on pservers, and never played a MOBA.
---
You don’t know what they’re planning.  More than likely if they have some servers with 4 full layers they’re gonna be doing free realm transfers to try and reduce that down before phase 2.  Free one way migrations were part of vanilla wow so the nochanges crew can’t say shit about them doing that.
---
Lol the one and only! Did I join your vent and sing them? I used to join others guild vents during raid and inspire the troops for combat rofl. The good old days. Man, gets me in the mood for some classic wow I'm telling ya.
---
Having modern addons is really nice, too. Lots of 1.12 addons are just really....clunky, for lack of a better term. They kinda sort work but in a really slow or awkward fashion. Modern client and modern addons just run so much more smoothly.
---
Also, being able to have VuhDo and WeakAuras. Fuck yes.
---
Trust me I wish I could go back to being 16 and playing all day, but as a responsible adult it's not an option. All I want is a server with other responsible adults. I know this is a pipe dream.
---
&gt; Trying to make it perfect is why retail wow is trash.
---
Is this what we are doing? Saying opinions and trying to pass them off as fact?
---
No, you see, clearly you need to be in a raid group with every friend you have ever made at all times. Entire guilds are just one big raid group right? This guy is making a weird strawman argument and sticking hard to it even though no one has any idea what he is talking about.
---
Multiple difficulty tiers to raids, as well as both 10/25 versions, was the death blow for me as a hardcore raider in WotLK. I felt compelled to complete the same raid 2 or even 4 times on each character for that extra opportunity for the item I wanted; seemed harmless at the time, but this is how a burnout slips in unnoticed.  
---
Having the difficulty increase over multiple raids gave a true sense of progression, while having multiple raid content available at release leaves an element of mystery and awe (maybe even lore build-up), as well as a collective long-term goal for your guild.
---
Fiber to the node has been typical for a long time. Besides that though, broadband internet through either cable or DSL was extremely common during the 2004-2006 period of vanilla. These people acting like everyone played wow with 300+ ping are kind of ridiculous. Some people did have to play with shitty dial-up internet, yes, but many did not.
---
You can always decide to not be responsible and go back in some basement. Drop your work, drop your familie and play 60 hours a week.
---
Its your life.
---
&gt; Should OPs situation not be an issue. Just add friends as group and play together in one layer.
---
Correct. It's a nonissue.
---
I think the more likely issue is a thousand "Legolas" hunters of &lt;Super Common Meme Guild Name&gt; will throw a fit when they suddenly have to change their names. Plus server merges are worse than layer merges because the realm layers all share the same AH from the beginning, whereas different servers will have different ahs and get a sudden massive influx of gold and items when the merge happens.
---
It plays just like it did in vanilla.
---
Same. And 5/10% gold drop in wpvp :p
---
Loot trading would be just as bad as layering/phasing. How are people wanting/allowing this?
---

---
Boss fights are already going to be drastically easier than they originally were since we're starting off with 16 debuff slots and the 1.12 version of classes.
---
can't find it on twitch, only bfa.
---
Did you read their blue post? That's the point of layers, each layer aims for a target population of 3k.
---
If all layers start to dwindle, then some are merged to get closer to that 3k, and some are fed new logins to get closer to that 3k.
---
They held their beliefs that vanilla was basically bad for a long time.  Then boom private servers become an impossible to ignore force, making the news, and then suddenly we have Classic.
---
I still don't think they particularly like Classic or care for it, and possibly loath it.  You have to remember, these people have spent the last 14 years "improving" vanilla, while people hated on them the whole time, causing them to entrench their feelings that retail &gt; vanilla as they defended their changes.  Now you have Classic coming out.  This is especially scary because if Classic is a huge success then it sort of proves they were wrong the whole time, and not only were their many years wasted, but that they were a net negative to the game.  (I know it doesn't prove that, and that's not how they should feel, but that is the emotional implication, IMO).
---
So i think the mindset is generally "well it's fun that these idiots want vanilla, we'll give it to them, whatever, they'll see how bad it is" but also, deep down "well shit, people are really hyped about this.  If this is successful my work on retail will look really bad".
---
Again, I do not hold this against them, I think it's the natural result of defending one's development choices for many years, then having those choices truly challenged for the first time.
---
This normally wouldn't matter, accept you have stuff like layering, something that no one would bat an eye about in retail, but die hard fans of vanilla hate it.  Obviously the devs aren't going to see what the big deal is, and since they introduced it so late in the game, there are plenty of vocal retail tourists to support them (as opposed to if this was introduced a year ago, when it would have been almost unanimously shouted down).
---
It plays like it did in vanilla. And I loved it. Go play retail.
---
You should place some more medieval ornaments around that fireplace to get the ambience right lol.
---
&gt; You don’t know what they’re planning.
---
I can only go by what they've said. Which is information such as how large layers will be and how many layers a server may have. I don't remember any devs saying that they're planning free realm transfers, but I could have missed that.

I stopped playing a little while into Wrath. At that time, I didn't do a lot of the end game content, so after having gotten two characters to 80, I just sat around and thought, "Well... What do I do now?" I slowly logged in less and less until I didn't log in anymore. It wasn't really a defining moment of, "I quit." It's just, "Ah, I haven't logged in a while now. No need to continue paying for the sub." Sad.
---
And after that, any time that I considered playing again, I'd look into the game and realize that I just didn't recognize it anymore. Fast forward all these years to now, and you know what I *do* recognize? Classic. I'm ready baby!
---
It's my fav.... I mained priest as well through most end game content. If you want a remastered version of priest song PM me and I'll send it over. They were taken off spotify years ago and you can only get crappy old ones from people's YouTube videos.

Yea, I could be a complete loser...

I think the recent massive growth of FFXIV and ESO prove that MMOs are not at all dead.

Omen is pretty sweet honestly. It definitely boosts not only your DPS but your suvivability more than furor can do.
---
You can get off a free heal when omen procs or a free claw or maul. It procs pretty often too, especially in cat form since you attack so quickly.
---
Like I said before, it comes down to personal preference and what you find more fun.

And worst come back in the world goes toooooo... ding ding ding, you.

---
Why are you getting so upset about someone having 2 of the se characters?
---
Calm down, just because other people like to play the game different than you, doesn’t make it a bad idea.
---
&gt;  15 years of internet infrastructure developments
---
All made pointless in classic because of the ridiculously large window of spell batching.
---
Ok I mostly agree with you on everything except one thing.
---
&gt;Layering in its "continental" form gives you #1. But it does NOT give you #2 and #3.
---
Layering can be improved to also provide point #2. Abuse can be limited via several techniques. One is already implemented in the form of CD on layer hop. 
---
Another solution could be based on player status. For example if player is in combat layer hop should not be possible for at least some time after combat ends. Same could be done with rested zone status.
---
Point #3 will come naturally in a few weeks when layering is disabled. And it's fair to assume that only a small percentage of people will hit max level under 2-4 weeks. So barely any effect there.
---
It's weird that you chose to focus on the phrase "layering is about overcrowding", because that's fundamentally what it's being chosen as a solution for - concurrent population needs to be managed without queues, and without the discontinuity created from zone sharding.
---
It's obviously going to be less dramatically effective at curbing zone populations in very specific, localized cases (i.e. Minute 1 of NA launch, Durotar, will still probably have the subjective, per-user, experience of 200 people milling around Valley of Trials, sure) than just sharding the zones, but they're going with layering because it's less disruptive than having people phase in and out at the zone boundaries.
---
And the reason given for that choice is to respect the "feel" of Classic, while also acknowledging that the structure of Classic could not accommodate a sustained rate of thousands of people crushing the start zones, 24/7 for a week, without massive multi-hour queue times.
---
My point is simply, "***picking a layer***" creates the same problem as "***picking a server***". Layers work because they're ***dynamic***. What you're suggesting is to make a layer ***static***. That's literally the difference between a layer and server to begin with.
---
Solving the queue-time and population-crush problem makes sense, because the pay-model of WoW is subscription-time, and it sucks to have external limitations on how much the network allows you to play, that you get billed for. Frankly, they should credit you the Tuesday maintenance hours, too.
---
Would make it harder to exploit by jumping between layers, but being able to pick the lowest populated layer also seem like that would be exploitable and only being able to switch once a day would more difficult to group with randoms. 
---
I can see why they want to fill the layers without player interaction, that way they can force the optimal population on each layer, which probably makes for the best playing experience.
---
&gt;I'm under the impression your clip is a bug in beta and will be resolved based on the blue post on /sit crit functionality:
---
It's not. This is the correct behaviour of standing up right as the attack lands, as can be seen here:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI) 
---
&gt;Which comes to my original question, without exploiting Reckoning procs with /sit, is it still a 'Break Faces' talent? 
---
I would say so. Using Reckoning will be different than private servers, but it's still a very strong talent. In some ways its better in Classic. Charges last through death f.ex.
---
Ok?

---
Would you explain? Are you talking about the TV features that "smooth" out the image, but add a delay when playing games? Because my TV had that and I turned it off.
---
That "rumor" came from incomplete data. What it really meant was that there were at least that many subs at that time but didn't have any upper bound, could have meant like 800k subs or it could have meant 5 million subs, there's no way to tell from the data that was found.
---
I don't see how channels (akin to korean MMOs) is antithetical to the MMO genre. Nobody ever said that it has to be one integral world with absolutely no boundaries. How is channel hopping in korean MMOs makes them not MMOs?
---
First in WotLk. I skipped Casualysm and Pandaland and played WoD a bit, Legion I played for a very long time and BFA like 2 Weeks.
---
&gt; It’s to solve overcrowding
---
Why are you still spouting bullshit, over and over.
---
You're pushing misinformation, and you're embarrassing yourself because you do it in every thread with layering, and the sad thing is you convince other people who are from retail that it's the same as sharding when you say it.
---
Dude. Read the Blue Post. Stop being that guy who is spreading fake news. 
---
3k chasing a single boar?? LOL that was never even on the table!
---
Whether or not you lock layers, every starting zone still has 400 people in it.
---
I dont know what's worse, Blizzard white knights/fanboys, or guys like you who blatantly spread false info because you're too proud to admit you read something wrong.
---
 Every loot you get in dungeons as you level will get replaced. It's not a big deal to have to split up the leveling loot especially since you are leveling together. It's different if you are soloing. There is a long journey before you hit 60, lots of leveling to be done.
---
 Also 2 warriors and 1 rogue could make for a fun melee group. Could do cool stuff like getting a 3rd warrior and a healer of course then AoE cleaving your way through dungeons.
---
It wasn't.  Basically no one did this.

I see the issue with the concept of micro transactions themselves. As long as people keep buying cosmetics, loot boxes etc., video game companies will be forced to put money and effort into adding cosmetics to the game and other mechanics that hurt the quality of video games like pay to win. The comapnies will make tons of money while having to put only little effort into the games themselves, while many of those gamers keep wasting their money on things that should be in the game to begin with.
---
With video games becoming more and more a mainstream medium we have seen the decline in quality and the rise of shady business practices. I think as someone who enjoys gaming one should not buy cosmetics out of principal. 
---
If someone thinks a skin is worth 5$ it's not my place to tell them not to think this way, allthough from a financial stand point I'd still consider it a stupid decision. The problem is that it's much easier for companies to sell people "pieces" of a game through micro transactions since 5$ isn't that much. But it builds up in time. There are people who have gone broke due to micro transactions. These people clearly couldn't estimate the value of their purchases. That's why I said the value of micro transactions is off. Some people, for whatever reason, are incapable of estimating the value of money and businesses like video game companies "prey" upon those people.
---
It's similar to gambling which is why some countries start  banning certain micro transactions.

Not sure, i would believe so. Try searching classic or vanilla on the twitch app.

I don't get why server merging is seen as so much worse than layering to some people but either way I'll hopefully enjoy what they come up with.

I have been playing a shaman with two warrior friends recently and windfury totem is just nuts man. It procs so often it has made me a huge believer that if you are a melee based group you go out of your way to find yourself a shaman to play with. As a side note shaman enh is pretty fun, I respecced to Resto at 44 to try it out for better healing and hated it, absolutely hated it. Definitely made healing dungeons easier but it was just the worst solo play style, had to switch back to enh

Ha, serious or not, your fantasy land sounds great to an extent. 
---
Unfortunately flying mounts were integral in TBC in order to navigate. I really wish the flying mount route had not been taken. As a mechanic it made flight paths meaningless and allowed players to flee without much thought in PvP situations.
---
Were flying mounts cool? Sure.
---
But it was the beginning of the divergence from Vanilla that paved the way to what it is now. Its just so unfortunate. I think in a lot of ways, its these small "sacrifices" that were made for convenience or coolness factor that really watered down retail. :(
---
Apparently discussing layering = retail fanboy. Apparently that is also a bad thing in this reddit because god forbid someone enjoys something you don't. That really triggers them. I am envious of most of the people who post this type of dribble because I'd imagine they probably have limited-to-no actual real life stress or responsibilities to get this worked up over a video game and about what other people enjoy. I remember when I was 12 and I was probably a twat like that too - I miss it sometimes tbh. 
---
PS - I play retail still mostly for mythic raiding, but recognize that Vanilla WoW was objectively/subjectively a much better game. I am not a classic or retail fan boy, just a fan of well designed content.
---
Quit sometime during WoD, the garrisons really killed it for me. Pretty much invalidated all professions which was a big interest for me in previous expansions.
---
That will be removed same as warrior enrage /sit etc
---
If that was the case they would have had no reason to add batching to begin with.
---
Ok then... 500 on each layer that fights for wolves ... if there are no layers it would be thousands fighting for the same wolves.. are you  dumb?!
---
I've seen a lot of tinfoil hat theories on this sub but I think this one takes the cake.
---
They did on shattered hand which was the server I played on. Righteous orb reserves, rivendare mount reserves etc.
---
Yeah sorry, I’m triggered because so many people have Layering misunderstood.
---
It was never meant as a solution to overcrowding upon launch. Blizzard still intends on having overcrowded starting areas on launch.
---
Layering is meant to fix the issue of tourists leaving the game after a month. Layering is a long term not short term solution.
---
You’re still gonna have 400 people chasing wolves in northshire on every layer
---
Layering is a very good idea for those reasons, but its almost impossible to pull off.
---
They would have to guess the amount of people who leave so accurately.
---
When you start with a population of 10k people per server at the start with layering and want to end up at 3k without it later, what happens when those 7k dont leave ?
---
Either layering stays for longer (aka forever) or your server is massively overpopulated with extreme queues etc.
---
Stopped a bit before Cataclysm, because I moved overseas and wouldn't have reliable access to the NA servers.
---
Mining to level engineering and then herbalism after, I would guess. The rogue expenses until you cap engineering would be less than paying to max engineering.
---
Kinda funny how you seem to be the most toxic person here...
---
The idea is that you let the priest get the killing blow on things when they are below ~5-10% hp.
---
I agree, the spell batching window should be lowered. It’s making the game feel way too delayed.
---
It will make people disappear in front of you. It will make mobs appear on you (and probably kill you). It will make mobs disappear while you're 1 hit from killing it, sometimes even those important quest mobs. It will make players disappear when fighting you if they see they aren't winning. It will also make players appear on you to kill you. It will allow players to farm the same rare ressources nodes multiple times, altering the economy. It will make your friends invisible if you're not in a group with them and in different layers. I'm probably missing some but these are mostly what you can expect with the current state of layering.
---
All of this happens because of in-game layer change also known as player phasing. It could all be solved if Blizzard implemented layer change OUTSIDE the game like in the character screen.
---
Here you can see it in action : https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ
---
When was this macro change implemented?
---
&gt;I don't even want layering. But I definitely don't want to wait 3 minutes in between tagging quest mobs.
---
So you are in favor of convenience over a faithful recreation of the game.
---
Retail that way ----&gt;
---
Sorry I may have been kinda dickish 
---
My point was that it’s way too much time and effort to invest in a game especially for many people
---
I guess then.. they are doing layers instead of separate servers cause they are expecting massive quit wave after some time and that way they dont have to use as many servers. Which btw is super downing to see the creators does not have much hope for classic :(
---
You are right, they were wrong. But their doubt wasn't justified. People who come back are often people who grew up, and also moved on with their life, finding relaxation in different activities than gaming. It's true that they didn't estimated correctly the "nostalgia" thing, and a lot of people will play a lot like it happened to OSRS. But a lot of people will also realize they are no longer in a state of life where they can put that much time into a game. The other hope is bringing a new generation in, but I don't see too many catering to such "slow paced" games. We'll see the number exactly after the hypes dies down.
---
Awesome, thank you very much for the feature suggestion!  It's always nice to pick the brains of my target audience.  Best of luck in Classic and let me know if you can think of any other features.

P.s.  I'd love to have you as a beta tester for ClassicRaids.com

Not to shit on your parade, but 2K isn't really that much.
---
:)
---
That issue existed in 2004. When a server got filled after a while they stopped letting people join it. They let them fill to a healthy population and then closed the gates.
---
Exact same thing needs to happen with layering. Keep each layer it’s own server-like environment with no hopping layers and no shared general chat. 
---
If you’re layer has asmon, it’s true same as if in 2004 your layer had a dick rogue on the other faction. Suddenly hopping away to another layer to avoid the problems in the world is the wrong approach that was *never* meant to be in an immersive game like WoW.
---
Amen.
---
Lmao, I couldn't tell if you were trolling or actually recommending a feature xD  do you think that would a useful feature to add?  I could see GMs wanting to filter by player type
---
&gt;Have you ever heard of the term "strawman"?
---
Yes, I'm more or less accusing you of attacking a strawman if you follow the conversation.
---
Layering does not look or feel like vanilla.  Try to look past the starting zone and see the broader implications of it.  Meanwhile, queue issues, overpopulation issues, etc, I certainly hope they mitigate them but they *were* part of vanilla, like it or not.  You can't argue that vanilla was a smooth launch.  So technically if we want to replicate the vanilla launch it won't be a smooth one either.  Please take that as tongue and cheek, but I hope you see my point in that gameplay is more important than a smooth launch.
---
Even stuff like server merges, which in the end is the real issue.  Many people hated them, but they were part of vanilla, like it or not.  Obviously you're not going to see a lot of people say "omg I love server merges" but I can tell you when I went through it it was kind of an exciting experience.  People who say "no server merges ever"... Well they are picking and choosing which aspects of vanilla are acceptable based on personal opinion.
---
To reiterate again, I'm not saying queues and server merges are a good thing by any means, and absolutely should be mitigated.  I am saying that gameplay should 100% come first, even if it means queues and merges like we experienced in retail.
---
&gt; I very likely understand what Vanilla was more than 90% of this sub, and especially you.
---
I mean I literally played it when it was released for multiple years, so this is a bit silly.
---
That's actually retarded. Layering divides the playerbase on the same realm and is easily taken advantage of. I still need a good argument as to why realm merges are bad. If it helps just pretend that each realm are layers being removed
---
I fucking hard layering. If it actually worked it wouldn't be so bad, but it doesn't. It screws shit up constantly.

Played Beta of Vanilla through later Burning Crusade. Played Warcraft II and Warcraft III extensively, and when WoW came out I showed up to our little EB Games in the mall to pre-order my collector's edition of WoW first thing. Was so happy to get it and install it, and always rolled weird characters.  
---
As said, I played from release until near the end of TBC. Pre-ordered and paid for 2 Collector's Editions of WotLK. Began seeing the writing on the wall for the change and end of WoW when things began becoming simplified, easier, and more convenient to the casual player. Lore was stretched originally to try and make it more appealing to people, and continued to be as WotLK was about to be released.   
---
I could see WoW becoming a wanna-be rather than a confident leader. That is why it has lost subs over time, it stopped being a leader and started being a listener and a sheep. People inherently want to follow something or someone great. Famous designers do not take votes and find out what most people want, they design and create something that no one else thought they ever might want or need. They continue to introduce challenges and allow people to overcome them, rather than instantly warp them here or there and create groups out of thin air. Instant swapping of talents, ability to change character names, realms, everything that creates what a character is. This is where WoW went wrong.   
---
Inherent flaws and problems create opportunity and ignite human ingenuity to deal with them. Imperfections and imbalance allow for greater diversification, differences, and deeper individual and interpersonal meaning. Deep story lines that make sense, flow, and bring you into the world create a sense of immersion. There's so much to game design and Blizzard doesn't get it anymore - so they made Overwatch. A very small, simplistic game and while fun, has such little depth compared to how Warcraft, Starcraft, or Diablo began.  
---
This is what layering gets wrong as well, people would be able to deal without layering if they just let it be. Yeah, there will be people upset - good for them, they can get upset. Those that will stick with it will continue to do so, they'll roll new characters if need be or do whatever they need to do so they can play the game. They'll form groups of 5 to kill named mobs, or venture out at level 2 or 3 with the group of friends to go kill level 5 or 6 mobs together. People will deal with it, Blizzard doesn't need to do much except maybe increase the server population caps.  Let people be people and play the game, don't separate them from one another. Let tribes, groups, and communities form naturally.
---
Then you merge layer 1 with one of the other layers that have low population. Each server is meant to have a number of layers.
---
Guilds on layer 1 *will* be at a disadvantage on a dead layer, just like in 2004 guilds *were* at a disadvantage on a dead server.
---
It’s the exact same treatment as real Classic.
---
You will all hate each other whenever anyone gets a sword. If one of the warriors were to switch to a clothie, dream team.

---
If it takes longer than a few minutes to get anything in osrs there are definitely people world hopping.  Look at buying feathers from a vendor for example.  Wow has world bosses that only spawn once every few hours and it'll definitely be used for that.
---
Another example in osrs is mining.  Any time someone is mining all the nodes in an area people world hop.
---
People will have to compete for sure in wow for mobs but it's more immersive to go to desolace to avoid pvp than to swap layers.
---
Of course they die in retail.  Don't be an idiot, that video was probably WQ/normal content in mythic gear or something ridiculous like that.

I was referring to the comment above me in regards to the OSRS community. And I agree with you that server-merging cannot happen, and that layering is the only option we have. I'm not against layering and I don't think many people are - we are against layer-hopping and the issues that arise from that.  
---
A user in another thread had a great solution, which was to allow you to choose a layer in the server you select, and then you are locked to that layer for the duration of phase 1. No hopping, no excessive farming, no dodging PvP and not splitting up the server-layer community.

It doesn't effect your ability to group, but it's definitely a buggy shitter. Shit will phase in and once you make your way over to it, it'll just vanish. You can be fighting a mob and Midway through you can just be shifted to another layer and the mob vanishes and respawns with full health... It's fucking aids.
---
By what logic? I only pointed out that saying "but it would make raids easier than intended" is silly because most of them are already going to be drastically easier than they originally were. That's just fact.
---
Layering still limits the population to a third of total server population, EFFECTIVELY lowering population of the zones. That's straight up facts. Would you rather fight among 500 people on a starting zone or 1500? Of course it's not sharding, but it's still like having three big shards, just consistent ones. Main goal is the later merge but it does reduce crowd on starting zones. 
---
Also, to be more precise math, there are 8 races with their starting zones. 
---
With 9k pop, you get around 1k1 per zone at launch if everyone was playing at launch and the server was full immediatly. With three layers that's 400 players per zone tops. Some races have less people, some have more obviously. Still reduces pop by a good margin.
---
&gt;that still think layering is meant to fix overcrowding
---
It is, kind of.  It's meant to address both crowding and player dropoff, so that we are not left with a ton of low-pop servers once tourists leave.
---
What’s your point? 
---
That we need a new AAA mmo? I agree 
---
To change classic? Disagree

What I tend to do is just take a 5 min break. Go to the toilet, log on a bank alt, get some food quickly. Then come back. If they are still ganking then I just switch the place I am farming. Played throughout Vanilla and never had a problem as long as I did this. Most people just blow it out of proportion or don't help themselves.
---
That confirmed? Everything I've see so far (all on this sub) makes it out like it's permanent.
---
Lol going to need to hire a Chinese lotus farmer 😁
---
If you aint gonna stick with herbing better take what you aim to use end cause you wont be skilling that the same speed you are leveling and it will lag behind and be useless :/
---
I started playing in actual vanilla. I was 8 years old. I was SO awful at the game haha. But I loved it. Played on and off leveling casually until wotlk. The game became so easy even my noobs self could make it to max level. At the time it was great, praise blizzard! My crappy pally can finally fight multiple mobs at once and level at a decent speed! I can queue dungeons between quests and Bgs and level without dealing with any hassle. Looking back I now can see why these features were bad for the long term health of the game. 
---
I managed to clear ICC normal before cataclysm dropped. Never did any hardmodes. In cata the heroic dungeons presented a challenge ingame I had never experienced before. CC was required. Mobs hit hard. You had to plan out what you were gonna do before pulling. I was hooked. I raided hardcore throughout all of cata managing to score cutting edge heroic ragnaros and heroic madness.
---
When mop launched things took a turn for the worse. Suddenly daily quests were required and there were more than ever. Everything in the game got trivialized except heroic raiding. Logging in outside of raid night felt like a chore and wasn't worth my time. I quit the game.
---
I came back for wod. Managed to finish mythic highmaul before I realized the game had all the same problems it had in mop but worse.
---
I didn't even give legion a chance because blizzard shutdown nostalrius. I decided to boycott all their games. When classic got announced at blizzcon it was enough to give BFA a fair chance. I downed heroic ghuun before getting bored with world quests and more dailies.
---
Can I set my hearth there? - that fireplace looks comfy
---
Lmao, how? That's facts right there
---
Should definitely rig it to vibrate on crit / ding / HK
---
In other words: the balance of the classes. Also makes ALL content easier is there's no debuff limit.
---
Age of Conan was just another in a long line of poor implementations.
---
Games are 99% implementation.
---
&gt;you are layered to the point you are alone in a zone with no other people around 
---
This is unbelievably inaccurate. You literally don't understand what layering even is. Its purpose is not to solve overcrowded zones.
---
Anyone with friends would just join the same layer, because they’d have to pick layer upon picking server.
---
It is not "griefing" by definition if there is a potential PVP solution to the issue.  However, griefing is/was something that would get you suspended.
---
If streamers want to do something on a PVP server, they should have a few raids of good PVPers to protect them
---
At the time they built the engine it was probably done this way for optimization reasons
---
yes, thats the plan - mark one mob for me to finish off :)
---
amazing, thanks!
---
Still fundamentally changes the game because now you increased the rate of loot acquisition.
---
Just stop. You can't literally change something and keep it intact.
---
It's not the same as a server-merge at all. In a server-merge, both guild and player names would be at jeopardy (often the biggest gripe with a merger), and that's simply not the case here.  
---
We also wouldn't have overpopulated layers if Blizzard would implement population caps on each layer.
---
As long as they only allow people with X hundred hours in Classic to vote and only open that system up after like a year once all the tourists are gone.
---
So make more realms at launch. If Realm #1 is at maximum capacity face big queues or join another realm. If Realm #23 is becoming a ghost town, merge realms at a certain point equal to the time youd want to merge/remove layers.
---
If you and your friends can't play together on Asmongolds realm then boohoo. A sacrifice I think is for the better of Classic, instead of the obvious exploitive use of layering (e.g mining nodes, pvp, rare spawns, general feel of being in the same world)
---
Why are so many people keen on doing two gathering professions at launch? I see that everyone expects to get rich fast, but come on... who is going to pay for that with what money? Why not just do a gathering profession right at the beginning and not having to bother with leveling it up later?  
---
Other than that, congrats on your choice, I'm still torn between Druid and Warlock v\_v
---
TV Game modes actually do tend to reduce input delay though.  Hard to know what it would be if OP doesnt give the model number though.
---
Cata.
---
I started just when TBC was launched. Did some raiding in there, but rather casually (cleared all besides sunwell, but after a lot was nerfed). Of all instances I loved Karazhan the most. It had a really epic feel. Also liked TK and BT a lot.
---
I wrath I became more of a serious raider. I have to say I love the 10-man format since everyone had to perform well, and slackers were easily spotted. In WotLK we did a lot fo 10 man heroic achievements (I remember the server first firefighter the most). I loved Ulduar and also Icecrown. We were far from a hard core guild, just did decent 25-man progress and really good 10-man progress.
---
Then Cata and kids came, and it was easy for me to set the priorities, in part since I was not interested by the Cata expansion that much. I started levelling, did some dungeons and a raid as well iirc, then I quid and haven't looked back since, well until now.
---
Now I look forward to playing vanilla, which I missed, to do some dungeons, and level some toons. Doubt I will have time to do any raiding, but that's life.
---
from the same article:
---
"I honestly think that Blizzard will offer its own legacy servers eventually, but only when subscriber numbers drop to the point that it becomes financially lucrative to do so. "
---
Basically 1 month into ICC. 
---
My guild either died or I just gave up due to raid filling issues and the guild died shortly after, I cant remember. 
---
I came back for a bit in Legion and played for about a month, and just before my sub came up for renewal, I learned from a buddy at work that played half as much as me that he had all his bis legendaries (we played the same class) and I had 0. I was so annoyed I just gave up. 
---
Didnt play Cata to WoD really. Played the last month of WoD due to the legion benefits that were offered, and hoping I would like Legion but IDK if I can really say I played WoD. I cant even remember doing much during WoD or when I logged it. I just remembered I logged in a bit and did stuff. 
---
I was hyped about DH's too but yea, none of that panned out. 
---
So I'd say end of Wrath, but technically I played a bit after that, but not much. Never raided after Wrath.
---
You might be in the exact same area as your friend but unable to see or interact with them.
---
When you join their groups, you sometimes will disappear from the world you’re in and reappear in their layer, with different players and mobs on different respawn timers.
---
It’s certainly going to feel very weird joining and leaving parties.
---
That, plus the alpha / beta invite to league, made me skip icecrown and finally left for good.
---
as far as i can tell nobody is asking for major things like a dungeon finder that auto summons people for free or portal rooms where nobody goes anywhere on foot anymore
---
In short sure.
---
&gt; You might want to look up the meaning of the word "scam" 
---
It is deceptive, defrauding and dishonest.
---
You’re talking about the video from the guild Serenity Now. And if you didn’t know the guild a simple search of YouTube of “wow funeral raid” would have got you shit loads of results of the same video.
---
He had a valid point but this interpretation isn’t correct. Glances are not white hits, they are above critical hits on the attack table. The only values above glance are dodge, parry, and miss. Even with no weapon skill and no hit against a boss mob, those values won’t exceed 60%. So you are always going to have a 40% chance to glance on an auto attack.
---
So it’s true, that I can’t make it a direct correlation to white damage increase. That’s relative to the percent of missed/dodged (hopefully not parried) attacks, and relative to the number of crits, and relative to any talents affecting crit damage (like warrior impale). It’s probably still not incredibly far off in a lot of scenarios. If you had a percent chance to crit equal to your percent chance to miss and dodge, (and ignoring crap like blocks that won’t apply in almost all situations... are there any vanilla raid bosses that block???), it would be a 4% impact. Let’s conservatively call it 3-5% impact on your auto attack damage, depending on those other percents.
---
That’s not true. He often won’t be able to see his friends unless they are partied, because the chance you land on the same layer is minimal. Also joining parties will trigger layer hops and they will cause other people around him to vanish and disappear.
---
To anyone who played Classic, that is an entirely different feeling of the world.
---
True but you are not doing this alone, it all depends on layering and how effective it will be.
---
and he was probably way better than anyone who browses this reddit back in 05 06
---
Sorry but undead are far better in pve. Do some research homie
---
It also felt like patches were frequent, so there were times I waited an hour for an update just to wait longer for a queue.
---
We sure as hell weren't about to log out to go afk for a while.
---
Some \#changes are OK.
---
Good to know.
---
Sure, but having fixed layers is pretty stupid as well cause it's effectively being stuck on a server for the first weeks. What if you wanna group up with someone that's not on your layer? Form a raid? You gotta hop. The fact you think it's not about reducing overpopulation blows my mind, cause then they'd just have a 9k server and no layering. If they layered it's to reduce the strain on launch to then have a merge.
---
And not having hop just means you're on a sub-server, which reduces interaction for some weeks. It means for those weeks you're not interacting with the players that'll be the effective playerbase later on. That's silly.
---
Played up until WoD. Mop was alright, but WoD turned the game to shit for me. I played the most in BC and Cata though.
---
That is fundamentally no different than a different server.  Regardless of what you call it.
---
And it will remain a stupid idea.  Layering is a vastly superior option.
---
Agreed.
---
They changed Loot Trading because we were vocal, I hope they listen to us on layering.
---
" Layering is about dynamically balancing the players on each layer, to avoid zone overcrowding in the first few weeks. "   
---
Not true, Zone overcrowding wont be an issue because without layering the population would still be the same, the only issue it solves is having 5-10k people sitting in a queue all day.
---
Yup
---
I see, i guess im just worried im seeing this with nostalgia glasses and wont enjoy it as much becuase of (what feels like) minor inconvenient time wasters, that were solved. I guess to me they still feel in the spirit of the world with a little less of the stress aggravation  
---
Thank you.
---
I stopped in TBC, around level 64, when the questing greens were better than my vanilla epics, I said fuck it and cancelled my subscription and uninstalled.
---
Can only speak for myself but Ulduar was the first time (nearly) all of the fights had heroic modes and you activated them inside the instance. You could do one fight one way and the next fight another way.  Some fights had multiple modes. You could progress in Ulduar for months and months if you were so inclined. Yogg-Saron had 16 different titans combinations you could try, which is just crazy to think about. 
---
Ulduar was also the first raid *designed* in wotlk.  It took a long time and was quintessential 'Blizzard' - it was ready when it was ready.  New design ideas, ambitious new mechanics. Algalon. In every subsequent raid it felt like Blizzard would spend the majority of their time designing and polishing the final encounter; in ulduar 3/4 of the fights had that polish.
---
actually agree with u for once.
---
Horde shitters LOL
---
Verycoolguy will save us 
---
Never forget Bonechewer US 2005
---
That does sound great! Might farm some gold in the pserver to try it out. Better to prep now and figure out what I like ahead of classic release! I'm definitely loving the hybrid spec which dabbles in balance, resto, and feral, so I'd eventually be getting omen no matter what! Thanks for taking the time to respond! Any builds, macros, etc. You'd like to share would be greatly appreciated!
---
Early gain it's most profitable to sell stacks of leather to vendors, as well as some herb stacks. People are so keen on it because they know it's gains :) 
---
I don't plan on making millions of gold with it but having two gathering professions supplements your gold per hour gain by noticeable amounts (for example, if you're making 50g/hr it could supplement your gains by around 15g/h per gathering profession)
---
Alternatively, stacks could be saved in your bank alt for a few months and sold for more gains down the road, after the massive mob of low level characters have progressed alleviating the inflation for low level mats.
---
You're such a great person.
---
they already announced they have ways to limit this.
---
He said world buff **stacking**.  My guild didn't even know it was a thing.  but we'd occasionally get the odd ony/nef/zg buff in org before the raid.
---
Labeling yourself or someone else by player type isn't consistent I think. So I dont see how it would work. So my awnser is no.
---
Copy Character over. Doesn't transfer items/gold.
---
&gt;The point is that classic is not perfect. Trying to make it perfect is why retail wow is trash.
---
Fixing nonsense that only existed because of technical limitations is not "trying to make it perfect" and I can say with a fair degree of confidence that stuff like this no longer being around has absolutely nothing to do with the current state of the game.
---
"Shammy roots"... implying you initially played as Horde... how could you main an Alliance!?!
---
I was on an Alliance dominated server back in vanilla. I'm hoping I'll end up on one this time around as well.
---
It depends on how you feel about level 40. If you plan to level quickly and want to get a mount as fast as you can, I think herb is the better route, and you’re probably better skipping engi til 40 too.
---
If you plan to pvp seriously while leveling and have less focus on the leveling race and aren’t super fussed about getting a mount asap then mining will be more convenient.
---
Your definition of "listening" is hilarious. But I expected nothing else. 
---
&gt;Why 80? Why not 90 why not 50. What if they are wrong and more will join?
---
That's exactly why they're using a good scaling, automated system like layering. They can't know for sure.
---
It's their job to not fuck this up. Of-course it's easy for you to just say "fuck it, we'll do it live" when you have no responsibility. 
---
&gt;Cripling the game is a part of the experience in the very start.
---
False. No expansion was this big of a launch. This is orders of magnitude bigger than the original Launch. Crippeling is fine, but goes beyond even the "Patch Day" server woes. 
---
&gt;We are writing 2019, server issues shouldnt be a problem anymore.
---
Ignoring the fact that multiplayer games like WoW scale factorial (about the worst it can get), this isn't a server issue. The game design is not capable of handling these numbers. It's not even close.
---
I dislike the way you've framed this as if there is no legitimate reason why some people might like the way that spellbatching affected the game. Vanishing stuns, gouging blinks, deathing blinds and polymorphs, properly timing eating/drinking so that they tick right away, playing around the combat timer, are all things that in many people's opinion (including mine) increase the skillcap of the game and make it more interesting overall. So don't pretend like the only reason people wanted the old tick rate back in the game are clueless idiots that just want things recreated because #nochanges.
---
Fortunately I have about 10 days off starting September 1st so I'll be playing during off peak hours (as well as during peak hours, let's be honest).
---
Yes. It happens regularly to streamers. Anytime you join or leave a party, you’re shuffled later quite frequently.
---
For sure, and I'm not saying you are asking for that - I can just understand why the people that like to tout nochanges do so - because if blizzard starts bending for small things why wouldn't they bend for big things?
---
yeah vanilla has dynamic respawn but its not as wild and crazy as private server dynamic respawn where you will literally die AS you kill your way inside a cave because it takes 30seconds for mobs to respawn.
---
&gt;By what logic?
---
Got to love when people just pretend to not be able to logically follow a conversation.
---
Let me spell it out for you. Just because raids will be somewhat easier than they were back in 2006 is NOT an excuse to further nerf the game and make it even easier.
---
I know that feel. I've been considering maining a warlock to try something different but I keep getting pulled back to my hunter.
---
Immersion? Who wants that!
---
One world? In the *World* of Warcraft? Now you’re talking crazy.
---
I cant confirm but people claim that it equates to a 5% dps increase, pretty significant for a racial trait if that's the case.
---
I think a lot of people are underestimating how massively popular classic is going to be at launch. The buzz and anticipation for classic far exceeds that of vanilla wow at this point. This is a AAA game company, and they have a responsibility to release a working product to its customers. To simply release the game with any sort of plan to deal with the millions of people who all want to kill wolves in Northshire Abbey or kill boars in the Valley of Trials is not going to happen. Period. This isn't even a necessary evil, this a must be done type of thing. There will be something in place. As far as I see it there are 2 major issues that need to be addressed for whatever system gets implemented, be it layering, sharding, or dynamic respawn. 
---
1. **Immersive Vanilla Experience:** Basically, one of the reasons people loved vanilla when it was released it the simple fact that it was this giant world and you kept seeing people running around it. You eventually would do quests together, and if you ran into the same person a few times maybe a friendship would form. You would add them to your friends list and the great social aspect of vanilla would begin. This social aspect was a very real, very alluring staple of the experience. To me, this is the big one. If the devs want classic to be a success, then they need to recreate this experience as closely as possible. For this reason, I support layering, as it seems to be the best option we have to recreating this experience . Any sort of janky phasing of players is going to kill this experience, so sharding, while acceptable in retail which is essentially a single player game, I think will be detrimental to classic. To be clear, the devs have discussed this point several times now, and they have made it clear they are aiming to recreate this experience as accurately as possible, which explains why they created this new system of layering and aren't just using their stock sharding solution that retail uses. 
---
2. **Prevent abuse of the system:** At this point most of us have seen how layering is still very abusable. Changing groups real quick does appear to cheese the layering system, causing players to phase, and mobs or chests to respawn. While early on, this really isn't a problem, but I think we all agree that it will be a problem if there is layering in level 60 zones, and its abusable. There will be hunters and druids who hit level cap within a week of launch. If layering last, say a month, that gives these players 3 full weeks to abuse the layering mechanic and farm and endless supply of devilsaur leather and black lotus, etc.... Obviously this is going to really wreck some economies, and is probably not a good thing. So long as they are capable of preventing abuse of layering mechanic for end game farmable materials, then it will be fine. 
---
So long as the system accurately recreates an immersive vanilla experience, and end game abuse of rare materials is prevented, I support it.
---
Layering isnt a solution to overcrowding, layering is a solution to the crazy amounts of people trying to logon at the same time on launch and play. Ingame overcrowding will not be affected and is not a concern to them. Thats the way it was back then and will be now also, just less queues and less crashes hopefully
---
Actually your argument for knowing the game better is actually an argument *against* summoning stones, more graveyards and flightpaths.
---
Due to our knowledge we can gouge that a decent group needs 45-60min in Stratholme Undead, but full quest run Gnomeregan or LBRS will rarely be done before the 90minute mark, therefore you can plan accordingly for dungeon runs.
---
Due to better infrastructure like Discord you can also plan your runs ahead and hit people up more easily. If your friend is leveling his alt, you can still contact him via Discord asking him if he wants to hop on his BWL geared warrior to help cleave through a 25minutes Strat: live run.
---
You die less to mobs because of increased knowledge, so you dont need as many graveyards. Deaths and PvP in legion are shitshow, because you die and are back alive in 10seconds, therefore if you battle in slightly larger groups the group winning has to fight the already reviving people. This is major bullshit. You *should* be punished for dying. You take away the incentive of not dying: you save time. You die, you lose time. Be happy that you dont lose gear or experience like in Diablo or Everquest.
---
Flightpaths feel weird in retail nowadays. Wyverns and gripphons are rare animals you dont find in every little nook and cranny. Having a flightpaths in places like Ghostwalker Outpost next to the kodo graveyard in Desolace would feel unauthentic, because not every little horde raiding party will have the logistics and elite personnel to have a flightmaster. Along those lines you dont see postboxes at every shitty outpost.
---
A warlock is pretty much mandatory in UBRS due to the summoning of the key holder you pay 10g to. There is just no reason to bring a warlock if you dont need the summon, because you can just
---
Social shaming has been shown to be the most effective method of behavioral correction.
---
We hate summoning people...
---
Come on, let me do that hipster thing where having the contravening opinion against what I perceive as the popular opinion shows that I am unique and interesting when all it really does is show I shill for corporations whose sole interest is to depart me from my money, a fact backed up by hundreds of items of evidence yet still I will persist that the stand against layering is just some internet fad on an opinion aggregate board
---
This looks like pure garbage.
---
I didn't start until TBC so I actually was a spacegoat shammy first!! Later in my tenure I faction changed to chase server firsts though. I strongly prefer being on the lesser populated faction. Easier to find fights and shorter BG queues :) Yeah, yeah xfaction BG queues but I still feel like it makes a difference lol
---
My point still hold true. Some guilds DID stack world buffs in 2006.
---
Yet I'm, getting downvoted for simply stating facts by a bunch of idiots who cant look up a youtube video.
---
Nah, Blizzard took your feedback about why you don't want sharding and improved on their solution, for one of the biggest game launches in history. Turns out they listened, but they're not retarded (mostly because they'd get fired if they screwed it up that bad).
---
Interesting, my understanding is that leeway only works during movement. Do you know if it will work during immobilization, such as frost nova or improved hamstring? Being immobilized in your deadzone is the true killer so I would be interested to know how it is working on the beta.
---
It is but does not require tailoring to wear afaik, so you can drop tailoring after making it. I reckon you’re talking about Truefaith. Archmage Robes don’t need tailoring in order to wear.
---
Well, putting on a shield isn't going to help your threat any more than being parried while dual wielding will.  You're just going to take more damage.
---
Now whether "more damage" is the same as "too much damage", that's up for debate.
---
Joining or leaving parties appears to be the catalyst to layer hopping although sometimes you can still randomly change.
---
Still. Do you want to be in a new world every time you join or leave or have a new member join your party?
---
Basically, there's going to be a lot of people trying to log into the game on launch. Blizzard has a few ways to deal with that, the first is to have long queue times, the second is to open tons of new servers and the third is to do something like layering.
---
Queue times are bad because nobody wants to have to wait an hour in a queue just to play the game. New servers might sound good but people want to play with their friends. The most popular servers will still have massive queues and when hype dies down, you now have dozens of empty servers that need to be merged into others or server transfers offered, both of which suck for all involved.
---
Layering though, while it has its issues, is probably the best way to deal with this. The server is split up into multiple "virtual" servers which are automatically load balanced. When one layer fills up, instead of locking the server and adding a queue, it just creates a new layer for anybody else trying to enter. While it has its downsides, I definitely think it's by far the lesser of three evils, especially as Blizzard has said it's temporary until the servers settle down in phase 2.
---
Im against layering.
---
Just let a healthy amount of servers launch without layering. This should result in 10-15k concurrent players per server. Put queue time above 15k.
---
This will result in chaotic early days, crowded starting zones and lag. A launch that an MMO master piece should have.
---
People will be able to see medium and low pop realms in the server list just like in the early days. Numbers will be a bit different: 15k full, medium around 7-15k and low at 3-5k. Since its the first few days/weeks, players and guilds can agree to go on lower pop realms if they decide that the high pops are unplayable after like 4 days of trying. They wont lose much progression on their original realm because they couldnt tag mobs etc, its just their decision to try somewhere else.
---
A few weeks elapse, maybe a month. Tourists start leaving and the number of low pop realms increase. At this point Blizzard should open free transfer to these emptying servers while lowering the queue cap of all servers from 15k to 4k step by step. People/guilds can migrate to low pop realms or sit in queues for their original realm.
---
After 3-4 months, servers should stabilize at 4k concurrent players (vanilla like) with a few of them having queues (vanilla like). Free transfers are open to low pop realms for further 1 month to slowly stabilize everything.
---
Is this damaging? Yes, especially to people who would like to play on their original server but are forced to migrate somewhere or sit in queues.
---
Is this less damaging then layering or forced mergers executed by blizzard? I think so.
---
Yes you can. There are a handful of us raiding again for classic, sebudai included.
---
That's a pretty big commitment :p
---
That was awhile ago. Self posts have given karma now for a couple years.
---
I hate layering but if it has to happen, which it looks like it does, what about a Diablo 3 style timer on a cross layer group invite?
---
You receive the invite and can click accept but it follows the rules of logging out (20 secs or rested area) to be confirmed. Then add an internal CD capping you at 3 layers per hour in the same way as the instance cap works. Not exactly elegant, but optimising a bad situation?
---
Well it depends. If your already going to be looking up guides and such I would say your immersion is already gone... but I never valued immersion in wow. But read the quest then use the addons to find where to go.
---
&gt;that's why some people use airplanes
---
ouch that's pretty a brutal 9/11 joke, especially considering this was circa 2006
---
There are several open world group quests against elites. Rogue isn't the strongest pick if your wanting to go as a duo, as there are other combinations that as much stronger. Warrior + Druid, Priest + Druid, Paladin + Warrior or druid ect would perform much better. But it's whatever you enjoy at the end of the day.
---
Here's how group quest work on vanilla wow.
---
On new servers you will have 12 people waiting for the respawn just at the feets of the mob. "please invite for quest" "sorry full" and spamming aoe spell to get the tag.
---
On old servers, you leveling your alts and don't bother with group quest, or ask a friend to run it for you. 
---
Most toons can solo elites with kiting and a couples potions/scrolls that you don't use for anything else.
---
In your brain, how does making someone wait to log in, also reduce how many people can be in one place? Once you are logged in, you can still all go to the same place.
---
Please think

Fixed layers keep the server immersive which is critical, typical reddit troll sucking blizzards dick

If he really loves you he will!
---
Yeah I was also thinking Mind Soothe would help quite a bit. Thank you!
---
Because friends can help their friends ninja loot now, at least in instances.
---
There aren’t that many elite quests, and pretty much any duo can do the vast majority of them.  I’d say any duo with a healer can probably do all of them.

I mean, personally, my list goes TF &gt; Gressil &gt; THC &gt; QR &gt; Maladath &gt; CTS &gt; Viskag &gt; Dal Rends &gt; Brutality &gt; ZG OH.

But yea I get it. The joy of getting the full Dal's set is pretty satisfying.

 **&lt;That's Rough Buddy&gt;** **NA - PvP - Alliance** **East Coast** is a group of individuals who have a deep passion for World of Warcraft.  Many of us have been playing since 2005.  Some of us even meeting back then creating great friendships that have lasted 14+ years. Currently our roster is sitting at 30+ dedicated members who are active on discord or playing together on private servers to pass the time waiting for release.  
---
We are looking for all players who want to be part of a Semi-Hardcore guild planning to be in the top 5 for our server to clear Naxxramas.  This will mean raiding 2-3 times a week with attendance needing to be on the higher side as well as knowledge of your class or willingness to learn to help us get over those hurdles on tough boss fights.    
---
Our raiding philosophy is to have fun.  Watching videos and passing tests to prove you understand the boss encounters and your role will be required to join raid groups as well as a minimum gear level with full enchants and consumables.   Once those requirements have been met, mistakes won't be punished. We're here to laugh, to cry, to kill some bosses, and get killed by bosses as a team.

Please add me on discord @ Smalls#5019 for more information!.

Glad you liked it. 😉

Gotta love those BC druid spells ;)

Thank you for the clarification on the name.

Just play what you want tbh. There will be advantages and disadvantages to picking the “meta” duo leveling classes, but it’s better to just enjoy the class. Everything else will fall into place accordingly.
---
&gt;People asked for a recreation of Vanilla WoW. A 400ms server heartbeat is exactly what Vanilla had. It's not going to be removed or changed. 
---
God damn right. And the game shouldn't run on any hardware better than an Athlon 64, a GeForce 6800, and refresh locked at 60hz. 
---
Man, do we sound like dumbasses!
---
WOW didn't kill it. WOW was just so polished and so perfect an implementation of the Everquest formula that it's incredibly difficult to release another Everquest clone as polished as it is.
---
That's why they need to actually take it a step forward and do something different.
---
Yeah these were my thoughts exactly, I want the immersion but I also want completion. So I guess I'll spend the next month making a checklist, knocking off quests as I go.  If I get stuck, I'll look it up, but stick with the normal setup.
---
That answer is yes, you can still do exactly the same as anyone else.  You just need more hit% gear than humans.  I raided through AQ40/some naxx as a NE warrior in vanilla and didn't have any issues.
---
Nobody uses in game chat as far as I know.  It's a discord world.
---
&gt;It does though, while not a overhail, it has higher rez and better textures  
---
for barely anything    
---
&gt;It does, the classic experience will be vastly different from the Vanilla experience from a balance perspective, as balance changes seen throughout the lifespan of vanilla will not be part of Classic, so you're going into MC, BWL, ZG etc with class balance that you didn't back during Vanilla 
---
Completely different thing. They are not rebalancing things, just going with more convenient thing since this is not a SP game.  
---
&gt;pretty sure it has bug fixes 
---
No, they are "features" and here to stay.  
---
&gt;We don't know that yet, since nothing for post naxx has been confirmed or denied.  
---
As of now, it doesn't.  
---
&gt;Remasters come in many different iterations. You have the Crash games (which some would even classify as a remake)  
---
they would be stupid because they are keeping everything as close to original as possible. Remake implies almost completely different game, like original FF7 vs new FF7    
---
&gt;then you have games like Sniper Elite 2 Remaster, which plays pretty much the same as the original but just has updated textures to make it look better 
---
Simple remaster.  
---
&gt;I don't believe classic to be a remaster, to me it's it own game. But if we had to compare it to something, it's definitely more comparable to a remaster than an expansion  
---
Re-release updated for modern systems.  
---
Just like Diablo https://www.gog.com/game/diablo  
---
&gt;I don't know why you're so hellbent on arguing this.   
---
People always refer to wow versions as "expansions". Don't know under what rock you live. Classic is the only one that's not expansion, people overlook it anyway and it gets labeled as "expansion", or rather "version".  
---
&gt;You keep saying its an expansion yet refuse to point out a single similarity to previous expansions in WoW. It doesn't add new content to the current game, it doesn't change balance of the current game, it doesn't impact the current game in any way, so please do enlighten me how is it an expansion?  
---
Above. Answer. I already answered it beforehand but apparently you don't read?   
---
&gt; It's it own separate game that has been recreated based on an older version of WoW (kinda like, you guessed it, a remaster).  
---
Nothing has been recreated. They used old code, art, graphics etc and worked on new ways to stuff it into modern technology.
---
Still, dude you need to understand that if they don't balance the number of players in one place then things will get fucked up. If they could handle 1000 players in one small place, they would, but it doesn't work well, so they want to reduce how many people can gum up one area at a time. 
---
It's not illogical to see a real pain point and come up with a solution that will let the game run as efficiently as possible while also trying to keep things as static as possible, when you can, to mimic the old system as much as you can up to the point where it still handles the above
---
Tailoring/Engineering
---
Tailoring for some BiS gear pre-raid.
---
Engineering for PvP.
---
Remeber that this is super expensive, since you cant farm your own mats for Engineering.
---
I didn't call for further nerfs or anything though. You're trying to argue with me over something I didn't even say.
---
You are not an idiot.  
---
You are wrong though.  
---
Others already explained why.
---
&gt;#nochange zealots that have no programming nor technical knowledge of WHY those things existed in the first place
---
Everyone knows why they existed, but this is a historic recreation of vanilla wow, which people asked for. So even though they arent necessary for todays tech they should still be included.
---
Well, make up your own mind here:  [https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwwsnt/youtube\_channel\_not\_staysafe\_did\_some\_legal/](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwwsnt/youtube_channel_not_staysafe_did_some_legal/)   
---
Some people will never care. They just want to consume content and will never give a damn about the character of the people they support (trump supporters come to mind). For the rest of us, we care because we care about the game - fraudsout is a community figure head, a content creator etc (he did official interviews with the games devs for one, and they clearly look to him for community feedback - before this anyways, hopefully not now). What he does, and is, reflects on our game. Influencers do much and more to make a game popular and to keep it steadily relevant, and one of ours is a literal criminal.
---
95% of players will never make it to level 60.
---
80% won't even get past level 20.
---
Totally guessing but I feel right about this.
---
Druids aren't slow at farming 😁
---
The Rogue is non negotiable, unfortunately. We do have experience leveling as an odd duo and making it work well, like Warlock/Rogue, with the Warlock aggroing via Searing Pain and the Rogue killing the slowed mob from behind.
---
I think the slippery slope argument is bullshit perpetuated by morons.
---
People are smart enough to see when something affects things that are crucial to the fabric of the game. Limited debuff slots are important for the tuning of encounters, ergo we keep it in the game. 
---
The issues here on the other hand are basically a nuisance, and anyone who played with decent ping back in the day felt the same way. 
---
And if the devs are as ruthless in the pursuit of authenticity as you claim, explain layering. Unlike batching and leeway, it actually significantly damages some of the core tenets of vanilla WoW. Explain cross-realm bg queues. 
---
They've shown they're willing to compromise on authenticity for much more significant issues.
---
It depends on how willing you are to take blizzard at their words. Ion said the plan for layering is to phase it out over the first few weeks after launch (tourists leave, peoples play times spread out vs everyone being on all the time) until it’s gone. He also explicitly stated that if for some reason it wasn’t completely gone by phase 2 it would be removed then, (because it would fuck up world bosses) regardless of any consequences like server queues or whatever. I’m at work so I can’t link the interview, but again, that’s what he said. It’s up to you whether you trust blizzard to not change their mind later.
---
I effectively quit when Cataclysm launched, having played about half of TBC and most of Wrath. Even at the that point the drive to eliminate class distinction was having serious impact on my enjoyment. My main class, Shaman, was for all intents destroyed.
---
I still sub for one or two months per year and I usually get the latest expansion gifted to me for my birthday or Christmas. There's almost no difference in classes now. Out of twelve buttons on my main toolbar like 6-8 of them do exactly the same thing on all classes.
---
I’m down with artificially limiting the software so that the latest and greatest hardware just barely plays the game on high settings at 60FPS.
---
And also, Europe should have to wait 80 days for their launch.
---
This is why you raid on consecutive days if possible. Progression-permitted, you can go down to 2 raid days a week, and eventually 1, if you maintain your roster (alt raids become a thing, sure). This way you only respec twice a week (100g total) and 100% enjoy 100% of your playtime vice 70% enjoying 100% of it. Just my two pesos.
---
Preach 🙌🏽
---
I'm very sorry your imaginary points on the internet are being downvoted.
---
Issue with not having it be dynamic and having static layers is that it is now small(possibly large communities) that develop a dynamic together that is broken after they merge a layer, if anything this is more community, economy and immersion breaking than having it be dynamically balanced. Also selecting a layer does not solve the issue of over population as one layer is going to be come more popular than another and inevitably have queues, overpopulation issues ETC. This does not solve any of the issues they are trying to address with layering/sharding.
---
Prot pallies can't tank in a raid.
---
They are talking about one person getting 6 rolls in raid for a single item because all their friends roll for it too.
---
also called "shaka" or the "hang loose" hand sign
---
For sure. This is actually a combo I haven't considered but may enjoy.   I could probably run dual gathering for long enough to start an alt with mining to help alleviate the engineering leveling cost. Thanks :D
---
Not saying the others are helpful for raiding. Just that their helpfulness wanes as you progress deeper into raids, while engineering remains equally helpful.
---
I mean, the raw numbers do matter if everyone is putting 100% into the class/spec.
---
For example, yes you *can* make a raid of 40 druids work, but *why* would you want to do that when everyone is going to have to put in max effort when they could play a dedicated class for each role and achieve the same results for half the effort?
---
That said, I am going to be feral MT for my guild so yeah...Extra effort incoming.
---
Other than the immersion killing that layering can have server merging is more versatile.  Say one server has all tourists in all layers even with merging them all later it'll still become a ghost town.  With server merging you can react to a dead server by merging it with whatever servers need more people.  Sure there will be ultra huge servers at the end but some people like huge server pop more than the inconveniences it brings.  If they don't like it give everyone the chance to swap to a lower pop server like you have done before.
---
New char models are too different to do that in retail
---
Fair enough, good point :D
---
To do this day I cannot understand why they thought Garrisons were a good idea. Well actually I can. Garrisons were an attempt to bring Farmville to WoW.
---
I mean the hit on your gear helps but you are still missing the glancing blow damage reduction which is a large bonus of weapon skill. You will really want to have edgemaster's.
---
I got the full FR set as well for no reason since I ran out of things to buy with them.
---
The only thing that you said that isn't completely true is that Ferals are a str class. For Feral 1 str=2.4 ap and 1 agi= 1 ap and .05 crit(5 agi= .25 crit, 10 agi=.50 crit, 20 agi= 1% crit, etc.). Feral cat wanting more str than agi is actually a myth. Your stat weights will change depending on your gear, so in some cases str will actually be better than agi. However, overall agi provides more dps than str, but they are really close together so in most cases it is better to take which has the higher stat. So you wouldn't skip over a piece of gear with 20 str on it because you had to give up a piece of gear with 15 agi. In the same way in you wouldn't hold onto a piece of gear with 15 str on it if you had a piece of gear with 20 agi on it as a replacement.
---
Here is link to a simulator that shows which stats are better when: 
---
drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SlB9gHufWFvQ5cs8dVXZOAftup-WteZ3
---
Agreed. If I don't have to log off due to loot lag at least once a day then what's  even the point?
---
I think the key for it not being a huge margin is that a min/max guild is better off having a mix of sword rogues and dagger rogues... if ALL rogues go Swords, daggers rot. If all rogues go daggers, some amount of swords (after tanks and dual wield fury and hunters) rot. An optimized guild will have a few of each to use the gear as it drops, and maybe a few individuals to be flexible between the two so that by the time a new tier comes out and extra daggers and swords have dropped, the flexible guys can flex between the specs (start swords in a new raid tier if it’s marginally better and you’ve had ample time to farm tons of swords, and maybe switch back daggers when the daggers start dropping in the new tier).
---
But if your guild is into min/maxing that hard, don’t expect to be a gnome rogue for PvP or night elf because you like chance on jump flips and to get priority on raid drop swords over players who chose human to get the marginal PVE DPS benefit.
---
+1 to this response.
---
Ludacris is a rapper, not a loot system.
---
Exactly my thoughts. Too much convenience ruins immersion and that added time invested means the reward is more sought after. Plus it means people wont just randomly ditch teams and troll, because they are more invested.
---
i quit after clearing TOC hard mode in wotlk, because it's a terrible idea.
---
this is why i'll only play vanilla/BC if classic goes down that road.
---
The Rogue tanks and kills, the priest heals the rogue (and helps killing)
---
Priest tanking is a silly idea
---
no problem at all
---
Nobody will ever see my comment because it's Reddit and not a forum, but you are massively incorrect in one aspect - the popularity of vanilla WoW private servers.
---
Before the rise of Nostalrius in 2016, there had literally been one decent x1 server - Feenix Emerald Dream. It barely scraped 1k concurrent players on their website. There were two more Feenix servers, one x15, the other instant 60, they had around 2-3k according to the rumours.
---
Even after Nost, WotLK remains the most popular patch. Though I do agree, Cata and MoP seem to have died down substantially if compared to 2012-2016, and Legion has not exactly filled the spot.
---
As a filthy alliance you may not get this reference but the door to the courtyard at the start of SFK.
---
Me: pull the first 1 or 2 groups up the stairs into this room pls.
---
Tank: jumps down stairs into thick of courtyard pulling 2 or 3 groups.
---
They are nothing like Everquest, they have real-time combat just like DS. Please elaborate how Tera or BDO are "turn-based". They are not. 
---
And again: fuck Dark Souls. If you think that a Dark Souls MMO is the way to go then you are deluded. We have been hearing the real-time action-combat mantra for more than a decade now and all of it has been shit. Giving it a Dark Souls paintjob won't change that.
---
However there are players that are just plain better at the game who, in their 'sub-optimal' spec outperform the players in their optimal specs. I often out-DPS'd sword spec'd orcs as a dagger-spec'd undead, when I was in mostly blues and they were in mostly BIS. It's all about rotation and location, baby. Unless you're in the bleeding-edge, realm-first crew, which 99.9% of us aren't.
---
Dwarfs are better in pvp.  They deal = dagger dps in raids and only do 1-2% less damage against (raid bosses) then humans with swords in pve (roughly the same on trash).  Dungeon dps is relatively the same as swords as well being as the majority of bosses aren't 83 with exceptions in ubrs as they are ?? bosses.
---
It was such a chore and not at all fun.
---
Ya... No Barb blade for a while. Cries in MC bow quest also...
---
When Classic will have 7 million + at launch, remember my name, and realize why you were the stupid one.
---
People smacking on me *bump hp back to max*.  They start blowing all their CDs lol.
---
Played mid-TBC to late Cata, quit because burned out from raiding 6 nights a week with a guild that hated me. Dropped the game cold-turkey, didn't even log in at all for like 6 or 7 months.
---
Rejoined in late MoP, shortly after patch 5.4 I think, and played on-and-off until halfway through Legion. Got fed up with the shitty legendary system, class balance being awful and so many issues with Priest going un-fixed patch after patch after patch, repetitive AP grinds, etc.
---
Ignore the people getting anally blasted over the criticism of layering these types are always around, *they do it for free as well*. Strange people. Blizzard will likely move the goal posts and I imagine '2 weeks' will be 2 months, probably more. I don't think Ion's quite removed enough from reality yet to think permanent layering is good but I really wouldn't be surprised if it stayed for the first half of the year. My own brief experience with BFA (and from what I've seen) is that the current Blizz servers are garbage and immediately fall apart when anymore than 40 people are looking at each other.
---
Once Classic launch is 7 million plus, remember that you are the one who should lay off the cocaine, and also restart your medication, because you are dumb as fuck.
---
&gt; 100 dailies per day came with isle of quel danas though
---
There were only around 10 daily quests and you could get them all done in like 30-45 minutes tops.
---
this was just posted a few hours ago, still thou very beautiful
---
Debuff durations were visible on mouse over if the target had detect magic on them. I distinctly remember watching my polymoprh durations to make sure they were recast at the last second.
---
doesnt matter if its one feature when its simulates a lag delay
---
Most people prefer layering to realm merges, and so does Blizzard. Real Merges happened in Vanilla and it had many issues. Layering is a better option
---
They are layering in the latest Final Fantasy Expansion and I haven’t seen any real instance of cheating/manipulation using that system. I honestly think most of the concerns are overblown.
---
if the rogue does its job, she will out aggro the healer within seconds. So you will end up with the rogue tanking anyway...   
---
You could find a rhythm  where you bounce the aggro, but I doubt that it is efficient, given the rogue talent trees
---
I'd very much appreciate that Wangchief!  It's actually more of a soft launch than a closed beta.  I'm trying get a good list of guilds on there before I start promoting to the public to much so I'm targeting GMs first.  You can sign up at [classic raids ](https://wow.classicraids.com/register)
---
I'm gonna bring a literal new guy with me.  My son is 9 and totally getting into video games.  I'm going to see if he likes Classic at all, if he does, I'll get him his own account.
---
I don't think they should change the meeting stone, but the times when healer or tank has HS on cd and need to travel from the other side of the world does kinda suck when you have 4 people waiting. I think the summon effect was better than the LFG queue the stone did before it was changed.
---
Your initial comment made it seem like the 16 slot debuff had no place in Classic, so you were indirectly calling for more nerfs. Yes, if you were making a brand new version of WoW you wouldn't have a debuff limit because computers have more memory now and limiting debuffs is nonsensical from a pure game design perspective. But this is meant to be a faithful recreation of classic wow, not some amalgamation of 'improvements'.
---
Apologies. Deleting then.
---

Damn hunters getting rekt by melee, couldn't even... oh wait ranged still shit on melee 1v1.
---
Did you even read what OP is asking about? If he makes 2 chars so he doesnt have to respec, how is that helping his PVP char? It literally makes no sense, he can't pass over the gear he gets from the PVE specced char to the PVP one.
---
I remember seeing these on streams...that needs to be fixed. It destroys the immersion of the game. Is anything being done about this?
---
If there was layering IRL there would only be 1/3rd of the pedals. #FUCKLAYERING
---
Totally JK, layering is necessary. Nice picture :D
---
Regardless, parents can share an account with their minor children, it's in the ToS.
---
Everything you mention is part of vanilla, good and bad. And, yes, many people like batching for the opportunities it allows in the game. If you don't want to play RNG resist roulette then perhaps vanilla is not for you.
---
It's actually lot less, now. Now that we know the proper values for weapon skill, it's only about 1/3 the strength of how powerful it is on Pservers. Don't get me wrong, it's still really good, but it's not a "need to reroll" situation. 
---
It basically equates to 2% hit now, which is still very good. But it becomes less important the more gear you have.
---
[Source](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)
---
Fixed layers are effectively more servers. Collapsing layers at that point is the same as server merges. It's also confusing because now you have to coordinate server AND layer with friends. Layer hopping fixes the extra coordination problem. Layers provide the possibility of encountering people on the same server, that you will see later, once collapsing happens. Fixed layers dont do that.

Yea man, that's why I'm providing explanations and you're just raging and throwing out ad hominems. Git gud.

Makes sense if u can get dps to stop

I want this so bad, once expacs started rolling out, classic zones gathered dust. So many good ideas floating around about possible content for classic+. I want to revisit old threats, quilboar, centaurs, elementals, etc. 
---
Even though WoD was hated it does present a canonical possibility to just
---
 rewrite the xpacs any which way we want. Hell we can have a Horde where Vol'jin gets to do stuff, maybe kick some murloc ass with him.
---
This time however let content bounce around more, all around azeroth instead of just the new zones quaratined.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Pick herb. You.need 2 flowers as a rogue. Sellung high end herbs earn more then high end ores.
---
Thanks for the reply! I think I might be able to force myself to roll a male dwarf rogue for pvp, I just dont especially like their animations.
---
You could if you spam stuns, from gouge to cheap/kidney shot, it's not completely unplayable if you really want to do it but consider that you won't get improved ambush and the backstab related talents until like 32 at the earliest, and by then mobs start to have enough health to survive the opening anyway. And, in the times that ambush/backstab don't crit the fight against your target gets a lot more uncomfortable real fast. 
---
Since a huge amount of rogue damage is pure white numbers simply equipping a nice, strong, slow mainhand and maintaining slice and dice is a simple and reliable way to deal with mobs.
---
Yet Ghostcrawler and Ion contributed to WoW becoming a worse game in a lot of aspects (their impact wasn't as big as most think)
---
It's not all their fault, lightning doesn't strike twice when you try to hire people that work in completely unrelated fields because they played your game a lot.
---
The whole crusader raid was what killed it for me. A tiny arena and loads of daily quests might be the worst raid tier in the game.
---
Rocket surgery has been around since at least the 70’s pal
---
You are so actively stupid it's painful.
---
There is literal evidence that ranged classes still shit on melee at high level PvP, even with the leeway as it currently is. You have such a deluded view of Vanilla in all your comments it really makes me wonder.
---
Engineering - if you plan on PVPing then engineering is really important. It will give you a shadow priest's [pre-BiS head](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12622/green-lens) (+36 shadow damage), a [helm that stuns](http://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12758), [grenades](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4390) and various other PVP toys depending on if you're a Gnomish or Goblin engineer. **You don't need to farm your own mats for engineering**, running around low level zones looking for copper and tin is not a cost-effective way to spend your time.
---
Tailoring gives the excellent chests [Robe of Winters Night](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14136) (for shadow) and [Truefaith Vestments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14154) (for pve) that will both last a long time.
---
I think you represent the vast majority of players with your pro-horse views.  It's clear we need free mounts at level 20.  The alternative would be too chaotic and it is a necessary evil to solve the issue of mounts being too expensive at level 40 in vanilla.
---
They got rid of talent trees? So what do you have instead for each class?
---
"[Able to work as intended or able to succeed](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/viable)"  
---
You seem to be going for world first or server first, if so yeah then protection paladins are not viable you would not be able to compete with one compared to the others. If you on the other hand only want to clear all content  they are fully viable. At first when this game was released they where not viable, as 5 raids a week 5 hour a day with proper tank and dps classes was taxing enough, adding to that a protection paladin instead of a optimal class and yeah people would leave. Do you really think people will be needing 4 or 5 raid nights a week to clear all content given 1-2 years?  
---
You seem to be making up word to be honest, it literally means doable.
---
&gt;But yes most of the issues that people cry hardest about has nothing to do with spell batching.
---
Quoting for emphasis
---
We have explicit video evidence of Ion saying layering is intended to be gone within the first few weeks and cant be in the game by Phase 2 at the latest (reasons like world bosses). If you want to believe that they will lie and keep it anyways then ok i guess you can be paranoid about that. The time to sharpen pitch forks will be if the day comes when layering is still in the game past phase 2.
---
Just curious, does anyone know if they have the latency and fps counters?
---
If i'm not mistaken, the no.6 (Request stop) is a beta only function that wont make it into live.
---
Can't seem to find the source tho.
---
Yup, everything you said. People can't fathom that although I don't *like* layering, I don't see another option that doesn't cost way too much resources.
---
Do you want to be an adventurer in the world or just a manually-controlled-by-human bot?
---
Your game, your pick! :)
---
See, I think *you're* missing the point here, layering is *supposed* to limit the amount of people you see for a while, then it actually raises that number later on.   
---
Your whole argument only applies for the first couple months.  Why ruin the game long term so people can enjoy being ganked for a few months by the same name?  Are you that conceited and egotistical?
---
Quick, the poggers are out, pillage the castle!
---
It will depend on your plan for guild life and money making ability. If you think you can get hold on rare recipes for enchanting/alch  and make solid gold of it you can roll either, if you want nice extra side money keep herbalism. Tailoring should be a go to in-between for the robe since its BIS for months to come. After you get it you should be able to make more educated and set in guild/server reality decision if you want to drop it for alch/ench etc
---
Against. If they will implement it I would like layers to be permanent and not able to jump through.
---
Do you need dark iron ore?
---
Do you need herbalism?
---
Herbalism if rogue isn't your main can be farmed from lasher packs, too (aside black lotus which will be incredibly over farmed and imo less valuable as the pserver scene is much more focused on buffs for raids).
---
Pick Pocket runs are guaranteed constant income independant of the AH.  Dark Iron is always highly valuable and a single bar is worth ~15g, which rogues can uniquely smelt solo.
---
So I guess it depends on what you rather do to make money. Both are good choices.  There is no doubt synergy between being able to mine your own minerals for mats in engineering.
---
except a ton of people who played vanilla are pro layering and understand its purpose. So it might not be what you specifically want but seems like the majority understands layering as a necessary evil to solve some issues.
---
He's probably asking for the first char. Alts are obviously another story but for the first leveling it's good to be immersed, enjoy the journey
---
&gt;forced landing for booked flights 
---
Isn't being able to log out instantly while flying also a comfort function? I swear I remember the 20 second logout timer while flying being in vanilla
---
Yes, his whole point is that no one is getting excited about a singular small detail. All the collective small details together sure, but isolate any individual one and it will not spark excitement.
---
Just do it on a pserver
---
Login queues like original!!  If you don’t want to wait then go play live!  This is classic!!!!
---
Neither of these are from spell batching, nice try
---
Private server heroes hate spell batching because it's not what they're use to
---
Retailers hate it for the same reason
---
we tried it a bit and only problem i got was stealing the kill over the shamans totems..
---
This sub as a extremely antagonistic relationship with Blizzard, from my experience. Every little thing Blizzard does is to screw them over, every quote from a dev is disseminated and scrutinized to figure out how angry said dev is that people want to play classic and how they are just fuming at the fact they have to make it.   
---
I understand Blizzard has been letting people down as of late, but its crazy to see the amount of hatred that gets thrown around from people that are excited a Blizzard game to come out.
---
It’s so the streamers can avoid stream sniping probably
---
Yea, I myself was pretty hyped for the flying mounts, and only later did I understand how they influenced the game. Actually many of these things that we see as WoW's downfalls were applauded by the community at the time.
---
But back to your comment - I don't see how the flying mounts are that integral to TBC - a couple of bridges here, some terrain morphing there - and I think it should be fine (from what I can remember).
---
And my fantasy land is super serious - I've been living on it for some time now)) TBC is my favorite period in WoW, but I also see how it was the beginning of what led to me quitting the game by the end of WotLK.
---
What about explicit threat values in the API?
---
I think it was added in WoTLK when addons just could grab the data directly, instead of making more complex way around calculations based on the damage. It's fairly dumb if they just cut it out, since there will be threat meters anyways, just with clunkier implementation.
---
The site is back up.
---
Exactly if its a problem 3 months in they will most likely open new servers to split the population up a bit more.
---
You aren't wrong, and I'm not a hardcore \#nochanges type, but I don't think this is a strong enough rationale to start messing with stuff. While the world buff certainly obviates the
---
Yeah it’d be nice for those random group ups though instead of sending dis invites out
---
&gt;But this is meant to be a faithful recreation of classic wow, not some amalgamation of 'improvements'.
---
Ah, but it's not really a "faithful recreation". Most of vanilla wasn't played with the 1.12 version. Classic *is* going to be an amalgamation. People who were progressing through Molten Core back when it came out had drastically different itemization and class balance, for example. The early phases of Classic are going to be an approximation rather than a faithful recreation since the patch changes aren't going to be simulated at all.
---
That is what I want!! I want the classic experience!!
---
No one is forcing you to play at launch either, If you don't like layering you could simply wait tell phase 2 to start leveling....
---
Take Engineering &amp; Mining
---
Farm Thorium &amp; any mithril you run across. Bug caves in Tanaris are good for this.
---
Make Thorium shells and sell on the AH or to your raiding guildies.
---
This will make you a livable wage for not too much effort. Enough to fund your raiding and save up for mounts etc
---
Yea Ion will never tell a lie....except of course for shaman class changes
---
The vast majority of people in Vanilla had no where near 300+ ping, do you not recall that there were shooters that were super popular at that time that would be 100% unplayable at those ping numbers?
---
That's definitely not an option in the 1.12 client
---
&gt;Your whole argument only applies for the first couple months.
---
Many players will be forming their first impressions in those months.  It's literally the most important time for a game.
---
The problems layering "fixes" are nowhere near as detrimental as the negatives of months of layering.
---
&gt;Why ruin the game long term so people can enjoy being ganked for a few months by the same name?
---
I'd love to hear how vanilla is "ruined" without layering, lmfao.  To answer your question, it was one **example**.  Apparently you are unable to extrapolate it.  We have seen the ramifications of inconsistent player interaction in retail. **People completely stop caring about those they meet in the world**.
---
&gt;Are you that conceited and egotistical?
---
Not wanting Blizzard to force a detrimental change onto vanilla is conceited and egotistical?  Interesting perspective.
---
But then youd be playing alliance. grooosssss /s
---
this wild idea that the game is fun to play, this isn't "work"
---
Hunters are literally still amazing at PvP. This is such stupid misinformation.
---
I quit in legion because the Diablo esque infinite grind mechanics were awful beyond all reason. They had been adding more and more of that stuff since mop but in legion they went all in on it. Wow had been making changes i found negative for years, to the point that the only thing i found fun in the game anymore was hardcore competitive raiding. All the sudden having to run the same dungeons over and over and over for a chance at sockets or titanforges, along with grinding a shit load of AP to stay cutting edge competitive with the other people who were doing it killed the game for me. Also i hate M+, just as a general statement i find speedrunning to be obnoxious and unenjoyable, having the odd dungeon or raid boss or acheivement requiring it to be done quickly is one thing but having basically 1/2 of all PVE content be based around speedrunning was awful.
---
The legion class revamps were also god awful, there was a handful of specs in the game that really needed to be looked at after the WoD ability prunes or just weird direction over the year but an overwhelming majority of the specs in the game were very fun and didn't need to be completely reworked. The marksman rework from a methodical resource management spec with cast times to a Spam fest was particularly heinous.
---
Legion might have been the point where i could just not stomach it anymore but the game had been changing for the worse for years. Things like LFG, CRZ, Play the Patch, LFR, Sharding,  Multiple raid difficulties, Faceroll dungeons, all just were hugely negative on the game.
---
Once a game starts feeling like work, I start to wonder why I’m even there too. I hate being forced to login everyday as well.
---
I read it will stay, since you could do the same in vanilla, by login out during the flight.
---
Aaaw man dont Tell me that :(( there is No way im spending 100g per raidnight on respecing :(
---
Lets see.
---
&gt;Immersion is dead in this version.
---
lmao you're being dramatic.
---
On a fresh server, with all the things that one has to do? Seems like a total waste of time.
---
If that's the case, why layer any zones above 30?
---
Why it is that way doesn't really matter in this regard, just that it is that way. And no, it can't really be a faithful recreation if it's not accurate, but that doesn't mean it won't be a good experience.
---
they should remove all the flight paths added during vanilla due to the reasons people give in this thread.  i'm sure people won't bitch about how annoying it is to quest in un'goro or southern barrens.  
---
but i guess since they were added during vanilla they don't go against the logic of making the world smaller so its okay.  a flight path at the rebel camp is absolute heresy.  
---
unless you want to remove a bunch from the 1.12 version we're getting, the only logical reason to not want the new flight paths is because they didnt exist in vanilla; stick with that instead of the brain dead platitudes spouted in every thread about non vanilla content.
---
You can't fly to somewhere unless you have all the connecting flight points.
---
When is this supposed to happen? And does anyone have a link to the article?
---
Even if it did make ranged slightly weaker than they would be without it, 1v1 ranged still shit all over melee.
---
Trial of the Crusader gave me terminal cancer, and i died.
---
These are always classics. We lost our main tank during Maexxna's final transition phase in Naxx. We had a rotation of 4 rogues evasion tank it until she was dead. So rogues tanked the last ~30% of an enraged Naxx boss lol. Rogue OP
---
They seem to be doing pretty alright, especially against melee.
---
I quit because wotlk dungeon finder and item level/gear score ruined the ability to make friends and party up together and totally changed the feel of the game. I’ve come back a ton of times but never for more than a month (legion was decent) but I haven’t really loved the game since BC or early wrath. Super excited to meet friends and party up and run BGs for hours.
---
/use Auto Shoot
---
/petattack
---
/use Hunters Mark
---
On mobile and don't main hunter so I don't have exact names, but since HM is the only GCD-triggering ability there, it should be fine.
---
Yes, because they will. Actually they will quit before that. The mid 00s aren't today man, there's nothing wrong with losing most of the tourists, it's gonna happen, I dunno why you think anything about the state of the game then applies to now.
---
Engineering/herb
---
Engineering is the master profession. 
---
Herbing to farm raid consumes and $$$
---
They don't want support time wasted on loot redistribution, that's why they added loot trading to retail in the first place
---
I will roll a Warrior but Im going skinning/mining from the start. At level 15 or so I will swap to mining/herb and stop leveling to get my herb skill up. I save most ores (got a list what I need to level engineering to 300). Get my epic mount at 60 and swap mining for engineering. 
---
Herbalism is the easiest gold at max level if you want to farm for it a bit. 
---
I like my engineering as I like my women.... Explosive.
---
Good luck on the game dude!
---
Ulduar was the last raid to not have normal/heroic modes.  It had hard-modes for certain bosses but I thought that was pretty cool.
---
By this time we already had 10 and 25 man versions of the raids but then ToC came along with normal/heroic and 10/25 man modes - 4 separate lockouts.
---
People are 100% overreacting as always. Hunter bugs got fixed, 1v1 tournament with the best players in the beta ensued, ranged classes shit all over melee across the board. People need to stop talking about this shit.
---
I don’t see a problem with either side. Love or hate the streamers/fans. Do what ya wanna do.
---
I want to play the game without constantly conforming to other people because they have decided I’m not allowed to farm there
---
I just built my own desktop for this very purpose.  Just finished it yesterday. I will see you on August 27th!
---
BTW any suggestions on PC settings or peripherals to make it more cozy?
---
Before it was changed to have the summon function, you could click it and you would join a queue for the dungeon.
---
If people don't want queues, they should play on a medium or low pop server.   It doesn't make sense to me that people complain about queues but demand to play on a high population server, but that high population server will be layered anyways if they get their way.
---
I wouldn't be able to play like this for 5 seconds.
---
Nope, they were pretty great features, I like them myself. But well, it's 1.12 or as faithful recreation as can be so, that's that. I can live without them and I get why they shouldn't be in classic, because of what it is.
---
And you're crazy even mentioning you like these things here. Enjoy your karma getting a hit.
---
This is not at all why layering exists. You're thinking of sharding
---
Faithful doesn't mean accurate, it means faithful. It means that they are putting their best effort in to make it as accurate as possible, not that it will be 100% accurate.
---
Layering is not a static world and prevents #1.  It is one of the worst solutions for immersion.
---
Server clusters is 100% better if your priority is immersion and a cohesive community of players.
---
As you said, no class is anywhere close to where it was in 2006. I’d probably say rogue is the least-changed class that you could play to kill time. 
---
Honestly I’m just dicking around in Nazjatar until classic drops.
---
Where are you getting the phrase "comfort function"? If you're not a native English speaker, your writing is otherwise quite good. For future reference, a more standard terminology in the software world would be "quality of life improvement".
---
&gt;The only LFG function I'm aware of was the one implemented in Wrath and is in retail.
---
It was there in vanilla. You could also queue up via innkeepers. I don't recall ever using it myself to be honest, but it was there. Innkeepers who can do it had a dialogue option about it, something like "tell me which dungeons I can visit" or something like that.
---
Patch 2.0.1 saw the LFG function added as it was reworked.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Meeting_Stone
---
I do. Tried the numbers but cant train my fingers and eyes to work together for that.
---
Yeah, I've said it elsewhere in this sub, but I think the biggest issue with warriors is that their specs are very one dimensional. 
---
Arms sucks for PvE, is incredible in PvP. 
---
Fury and Prot suck for PvP, but are incredible in PvE.
---
No thanks. I'll take layering. And lucky me, it's already in the game, so arguing with random little doesn't affect it at all.
---
I for one welcome our tyrannical low effort meme-banning moderation staff.  May they rule this subreddit a thousand years.  Banzai!
---
It's weird how dailies were something people cite as a problem, but I thought they added a ton of value to the game when you didn't want to/weren't ready to raid but were at max level. I liked the Isle dailies.
---
Yea, except no. Ranged are still shitting all over melee, this is exactly what low latency players in Vanilla experienced.
---
Yeah... healing pre-DM 55 water is pure hell. Mana breaks take twice as long, and you know the group isn't waiting on a double time mana break.
---
Socks? Barefoot is where it's at! No socks means no foot sweat
---
I recommend the Golden Gate Bridge - very luxurious place to put down roots with excellent air flow!
---
Trying to submit a new guild results in SERVER ERROR message.
---
All RP servers are excluded from these things on live. To preserve their community. It apparently doesn't matter for normal servers though.
---
The problem with the login queue solution is that they're expecting the _opposite_ of launch to occur. With Vanilla they launched with X servers and the population kept expanding daily so they could just keep buying servers to meet demand. With Classic they're expecting peak population to be between days 1-7 then a sharp decline over the next few weeks. It would work to a degree but it would also severely limit the population moving forward as people who may have not played Vanilla/BC would likely not want to spend 10 hours in a queue for a game they're not committed to (even if they would fall in love with it after trying it)
---
I could agree with layering 1-5 zones.  Beyond that no way.  Too much stuff takes place at 6+, especially in Elwynn forest.
---
You are the ultimate sperg LOL
---
Unless there is a classic wow armory page, you won't be able to inspect anything but a player's gear.
---
That solves none of the issues they are trying to solve with layering:
---
Population Controls: if people can select their layer you will get ones with queues, ones that are empty.  And what happens if one layer does not see a population dip for a while does this layer stay separated...... How is this a solution to the problem?
---
Community development: Sure you will develop a community within your layer but the second you take layer A and layer B and slam them together there goes all that community you developed. Even worse if your in PVP servers and you go from the dominant faction to weak faction over a Tuesday Maintenance how that that make you feel. Your game and immersion are completely gone. Same can be said about guilds, economy, etc. Does that really fix your immersion and your community over being in the same server with all these people that you will see every day?
---
Which aggros the patrols, which then chain aggro the packs near the stables. Experienced many a tank fail miserably in that lovely place.
---
Never played mage so I missed that! Thanks for spotting that, I'll update it
---
Unfortunately intel's CPUs still beat out everything else in single core gaming performance.
---
I’m not justifying it. There’s not exploitive about it either. No one is forcing you to join those groups. 
---
Also I could care less if some random on the internet believes me. Get a grip.
---
You mean FFXIV where players teleport to every destination, and nobody ever actually travels in the open world? Bad comparison.
---
If you could have looked past that, MoP was (in my opinion) one of the most enjoyable expansions to date.
---
Aha, so they knew about pandaria!
---
Then it shouldn't be so difficult to find where they said vanilla was shit.
---
Never heard them say "well, I guess people want this, so..." either, or anything similar. The idea that the Classic devs are simply lying to our faces about being excited about vanilla is ridiculous. The developers look genuinely excited when they talk about it in interviews. I'll never get onboard that tinfoil train that they secretly hate what they're creating and are hoping it fails just to say "I told you so".
---
&gt;Maybe you keep hearing this because you are biased to being pro-Blizzard?
---
It's a general statement unrelated to this............
---
That isn't layering, it's sharding. They switched to layering because the community reee'd about "mah immersion" involving phasing out at random times. 
---
We complained about 'starting zone' phasing, got layering instead, and now are complaining about Blizzard listening to our complaints.
---
Lol gear matters more in classic as people will be doing molten core week 1 and 2.
---
Yes, messaging is another feature I'm planning on implementing.  For now you can insert a discord username and other contact info in the user which will show up on the guild leader's page
---
This is what I'm afraid of too. I feel like they have no intention at all to take out layering and are just trying to delay removing it until hopefully, the fans forget.
---
You shouldn't even be leveling a rogue as a dagger spec because sword/mace spec is much more efficient. I would highly suggest you level as combat swords then feel free to spec dagger once you get near level 60. The rogue would make a much better tank than the priest because they have high dodge and high parry + disarm with combat talents. Also it lets the priest heal without getting spell push back.
---
Why is a ticket better than a system?  In your abuse scenario, a ticket system would not prevent that from happening.
---
Ideally this system is only available for master loot style and in raid parties, not 5man groups.
---
I have done both and I liked the horde much better.
---
Pvp racials
---
org &gt; IF&amp;sw
---
I liked their travel better
---
How can you acknowledge this is a repost and then still post it
---
I did. It doesn't.
---
If I could find more of my old friends to play, I'd for sure roll horde - but I've only come across 1 so far.  I keep asking people if they're going to play - and most have no idea that classic is even a thing.
---
A lot of people at bad at this game. Simple as that. It's why there are so many tiers of raiding now. So everyone can at least experience the story side of raids, even if they can barely play. The consequence of having only one difficulty tier for content is that it's either going to be too easy for a lot of people or too hard for a lot of people. It's more immersive to have one tier of difficulty (though that doesn't necessarily include in-game activated hard modes like in Ulduar and some other raids), but from a business perspective, you don't want to create content that only a small part of your playerbase is going to see. It's not cost efficient. 
---
I prefer the one tier of difficulty (I don't even like having variable player limits for raids) for all content, unless there is a good lore friendly way of adding a hard mode , but I know I don't speak for everyone in this regard. It just seems more correct from an in-game perspective to have a set standard of difficulty for content and if you can't complete it you can't complete it. Git Gud basically.
---
That’s fair, just wanted to offer a possible solution so you can still have the type of fun you want to have along with everyone else. I hope they add RP-PvP servers. If they don’t, then I hope you can still enjoy the game. Hope to see you in Azeroth, adventure!
---
&gt; Vanilla private servers have been going very strong for more than a decade now
---
any real numbers on this? i don't believe it.
---
Many of masses can clear most modern day raids which are arguably more difficult. I think it's safe to say a majority of the player-base could clear it, just most won't have the time involved ect.
---
The headset looks all right, but I can’t stress enough the comfort that the void pro Has. If I wasn’t getting a Naga I will get the corsair version.
---
I looked at lap boards and yes they are expensive, also the reviews on them were terrible. My keyboard is the heavy ass black widow ultimate. I’m using the Naga trinity so I have two other options for buttons on the side of the mouse. Overall I’m happy with my peripherals, even if the price tag was a little steep.
---
It will kill the immersion for anyone who never played Vanilla before.
---
For those that did, it won't matter, since we already know Vanilla like the back of our hand.
---
It won't ruin the game, but it will have a negative impact on immersion for new players.
---
Personally I would be happy not seeing anyone I'm not in a party with till level 15. After playing the last stress test and watching 200 people fight over tagging the same mobs for two hours jus to get out of the starting zone I'm all for layering at least in mulgore and other starting zones. After that everyone will spread out so there won't really be any need for layering but what do I know I never played vanilla
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
“Vael is no joke in bwl” hahaha what?!? Out of all the bosses you could have said that were hard, you picked vael?
---
They won't clear naxx in 4 hours but they will clear it the first ID it opens
---
Rogues work just as good as warrior if not better due to their high mitigation and riposte in combat talents. Also they have evasion if things get rough.
---
How about a compromise? Some servers with layering and some are without
---
Everyone is happy
---
with proper talent build and wand you are a leveling machine with little downtime, smooth enjoyable ride

You dropped this \

THIS! You're telling me Blizz can't fucking take a few low pop servers and merge them together? Like come on guys. nobody wants layering.
---
It's player dependent IMO, i know people that just wouldn't make it to 60 without the hand-holding, they're going to toggle instant quest text and never read a god damn thing so without markers they'll just not play. They were fine with it in Vanilla but it's been 12+ years of hand holding now, so they aren't going back.
---
I won't bother since i never did back then but i do recall even reading everything you still get some quests that are cryptic AF or just straight up don't tell you what you need to know, so if having to google shit will annoy you / take you out of it then just use Questie.
---
I'm only watching because It's a new raid and I'm not subscribed to retail.
---
I hope you haven't forgotted me, Wyke.
---
Oh don't worry, I actually have the mental capacity for patience and choosing different alternatives, unlike the whiny BFA players who think everything should be gifted to them on a silver platter.  On a side note it's really astonishing watching the BFA crowd switch from:
---
"classic will never happen" 
---
"classic won't be successful"
---
"I want XYZ retail mechanic in classic because not what *I* like"
---
I know you wanted this to be your "gotcha" moment, but it failed miserably.
---
Yeah I would much sooner gquit than put up with attitudes like this. I'm playing the game to have fun
---
kind of agree with you there. OSRS voting makes more sense once the game is launched and they can have the options/info ingame, limit it only to people with certain levels or playtime ect. i don't think doing it here is a good idea
---
I'd say they're loosely organized. These days most classes have to choose between completely different types of talents, like a defensive cooldown OR a speed buff, instead of three types of speed buffs.
---
There’s hundreds of streamers doing the new raid....
---
But sure. Pick a streamer you clearly dislike just to cry about it. That makes sense.
---
Resto druids can aoe farm in the world and in certain dungeons. Barkskin + Hurricane means you can pull 5-6 mobs every minute. That can be pretty efficient for farming elementals, felcloth, etc. Additionally you can solo multiple bosses in maraudon, dm runs, bloodvine in zg, etc. all of which can be done solo. IMO Shaman and Paladin have it far worse than priest or Druid.
---
lol you watch someone you don't like just so you can make a post about you not liking him?
---
I heard something from a streamer that I loved.  On the latest Countdown to Classic, Josh was talking to Dr Lupo who said something I've been harping on for a long time. When it greifing was brought up, Lupo was insanely humble about his take. I'm paraphrasing but his response was something like "we're broadcasting are exact location with as little as 5 seconds delay so we're essentially inviting people to mess with us". I think that's bang on the money and more people need to view it as such. Streamers should expect to be stream sniped in this game.
---
I know this is off topic, but something that jumped to my mind. They definitely discussed the free loot they are given in the podcast as well. I was unaware how widespread that was until I listened to their discussion
---
willitclassic.com
---
Facts are facts. I am sorry you disagree.
---
Almost every class is one button spam in raids tbh
---
Well he was known as the “guild breaker” for a reason. Threat is going to be a new concept for a lot of players.
---
Most streamers get gear funneled to them, what are you on about?
---
Nah it’s still pathetic that you’re white knighting a corporations decision to save money while diminishing the experience because it’s better for “your” catered experience.
---
Buddy, I’m sorry, but you are severely misunderstanding this. Influx does not mean leaving, it’s talking about a surge of players, i.e, the launch of classic wow.
---
Balancing players still goes into effect. The layering right now only alleviates how much of a madhouse starting areas are. If the layering wasn’t in place, I doubt you could get even a point of damage on a mob. The starting areas are layered, they are not trying to simulate the initial rush cause there wasn’t one, just people in waiting queues.
---
You sound delusional.
---
Thats iffy. A portion dont know Motion rate isn't Hertz. A 120 motion would be 60hz. A lot of people screw up on that. Or the TV cuts it's real Hertz in half by using a higher quality. I've seen 1080p 75hz then bump it to 4k and it goes down to 30. Let alone a lot cant sync with modern GPUs that have GPU syn.

ELI5 layering?
---
Ooh my brother has the Void pro and he loves.  Its just a little pricy for a budget gamer with "sponserbilities" but i'll keep that in mind.
---
Oh, I must not have pushed that change to production yet.  I'll add it shortly.  I apologize for the inconveniences.  I'm trying to guage the interest in a product like this before I spend to much time on it but it does look like there's interest so I'll be doubling down on my efforts!  I greatly appreciate all you feedback so far Thirteenera
---
Right? My character is still unfun to play. :( 8.2 didn't fix that.
---
I like that AQ, Uldum and Karazhan were planned from the start. And LOLL at "Tauren Newbie"
---
Honestly, it's still a pretty low number of abilities compared to something such as a warlock, a shaman, a druid or a mage (assuming they downrank too)
---
Durotar waiting room
---
Stop watching sodapoppin and asmon then. Watch real streamers really play the game. 
---
If you think that all streamers get all the loot funneled to them then you watching Asmongold makes perfect sense.
---
No. This is the exact sentiment I think is too common. Naxx had some punishing mechanics and straight gear checks that skill can’t overcome
---
God damn brother say it again for the ones in the back you absolutely nailed it.
---
No. Noone had computer or network issues, it's just a stupid myth being repeated here.
---
Leveling a priest is pretty good. It's... Efficient with barely any downtime. The downside is that it's pretty simple. Mind Blast -&gt; SW:P-&gt; Wand. That's what you'll do. If you have a shit wand you can start with Holy Fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; Wand
---
Pre-40 spec into wand spec and Spirit tap, rest are pretty much whatever. At 40-45 spec into shadow form.
---
Obviously not.  They are not different from just having a good memory once you already hit 60.
---
Orc has 5% pet damage too
---
No I’m pretty sure I saw 3 per account
---
Lol yea totally dude. Retail scrubs have no idea what threat is at all. Totally new mechanic and will probably make people quit the game. 
---
Hahahah
---
I think it’s either the 12th or 13th
---
I don't agree that communities would be broken apart once layers merge, because all you're doing is removing the barriers between players on that server once phase 1 ends - people are being added, not taken away. Also, you do realize that all layers in a server will merge once phase 1 completes anyway, right? The server-layer communities and economies will all be merged regardless whether my suggestion happens or not.  
---
Yes, I'm sure some layers would be more popular than others, and again - this will occur anyway whether my suggestion happens or not. With my suggestion though, the layers would have population caps - something I don't believe they have now (which you could also argue would cause overpopulation of some layers). With caps you could at least control the flow of players.  
---
I'm glad you had a positive experience, and I'm sure for the most part layering won't be noticed. However, that doesn't change the fact that it can be abused by players and guilds for gold and items they wouldn't be able to get otherwise. It would also be extremely frustrating to engage in pvp with another player, only for them to layer-hop as you are about to land your killing-blow.  
---
Layering IS the answer. However, I don't think Blizzard should allow players to freely hop among them, as it causes a lot more problems than there would be had layers have a static population.
---
Lmao you’re stupid
---
I mean it's all speculation but I could see a large group of dedicated players congregating to a handful of servers.  Granted it wouldn't be fixed by having more servers than layers but layering would only delay that problem.
---
Then don't roll it? Your input on this means nothing.
---
Honestly I'm going to take it slow. No rush.
---
The only reason people clear it fast are by fury tanking on pservers. Also the bosses and mobs will jave different numbers than classic like the parry chance is significantly higher in vanilla than it has been on pservers. If things like fury tanking and stacking armor pots or similar things for other classes does not work the pserver crowed will not be able to do a 4 hour clear.
---
Oh you can't? Sorry coming from retail but there you can fly to points even if you don't have every point in between so long as the distance is close enough or something. On the other hand if you click the "Drop me off" button it won't drop you off on flight points you haven't taken yet so it can't be used to get all the flight points
---
You won't fool anybody, they'll ask you to drop a mana totem then it's GG, no addon API required.
---
&gt; The blizzard issue is at least partially because of (maybe a bug) where blizzard doesnt apply damage on the first tick
---
I thought that DoT's don't tick damage on first application, they tick after the debuff is applied. Obviously this doesn't apply to damage+DoT spells like Immolate
---
Quest progression isnt linear in Vanilla though. You still have to use your head to actually figure out the most optimal questing route, which quests to accept in what order etc.
---
There's imo nothing fun about trying to find a quest objective with some terrible description like "Behind the root of the old tree with the small rock" in a zone that is all forest.
---
&gt;The vast majority of people absolutely hate it and don’t want anything to do with it.
---
Please provide a source for this claim
---
Yep, autoloot is fine, AoE loot is bullshit
---
Yeah blizzard does 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I was under the impression that we were going to use willitclassic.com in lieu of the real platforms like curse etc, but we'll have to see what bubbles up.
---
The scenario only happens when you are allowed to loot trade. Get rid of that, I never said a ticket system would prevent that. People are arguing its good for accidental needs, in which case a ticket system worked just fine and didnt allow warriors to roll need on a cloth belt for their priest buddy in the group.
---
As a rogue that PvPed a lot and duelled a lot in vanilla, I never once ran through a trap.
---
It was a small window however where I could sap the hunter before I froze with sprint.
---
But never ran over a trap that didn't fire off.
---
Because you can take one talent point in weapon expertise giving you a total of 8.
---
“All streamers get funneled loot” apparently he says. Lol. As he watches the streamers that don’t play retail haha.
---
If they meet good people - they will stick around I think. Its a matter of sticking with it long enough to get over the initial jarring changes of convenience but that will lose people for sure.
---
Nah, I don't think a game that feels unpolished at times or unbalanced makes it appealing. I think the classic gameplay is what appeals to people
---
Oh I played in to mists. Eventually hung it up because of losing the “feel” I talked about. 
---
I’m not one to be dogmatic about the game being crap at that point; but it was ruined for me.
---
Yeah, I have definitely felt the effect of not having it on servers that shall not be named, but I've never really tinkered with having improved sprint, which is something that could have swung a lot of fights for me. Also, blind and vanish are two of my favorite CDs, so that reduced CD time is nice. Just gonna play with the trade offs now, hopefully settle on something before I'm wasting a permanent character's gold lol
---
&gt; defending the ability to layer hop 
---
Oh, the layer hopping with the cool down that they will be adding?
---
Layering (at least how they pitched it) is not going to solve this.  
---
But who knows, Blizzard has been intentionally opaque with everything related to this topic.
---
Moving it to in raid only was a great compromise. At the raid level there's already a higher level of trust, and I suspect 99% of the GM complaints to move loot are related to in-raid items. 5mans will still have full transparency.
---
Vael is a cakewalk these days.  Majority of guilds will one shot him the first attempt
---
Pros of large spell batch window:
---
-get vanilla-like interactions such as charging each other in the same batch, swapping positions
---
-takes stress off the server, making larger battles possible
---
Cons
---
-your spells aren't executed as quickly, making it less responsive
---
Seems to me that if you think the cons outway the pros, you should be playing BFA instead. Nothing wrong with that, but there's no reason to be mad at Classic for being exactly what Classic fans want.
---
Naxx will be cleared within 4 hours of release. Private server guilds are rolling on classic. Top retail guilds like Method are rolling on classic. The strats for all of the fights are known. The only barrier to clearing it is coordinating the raid team and getting the consumables. At the point of Naxx launch, the serious guilds will have the gear and raid composition to ass fuck the raid.
---
&gt;Never heard them say "well, I guess people want this, so..." either, or anything similar. 
---
This was basically the Classic announcement.  IMO Brack didn't look the least bit pleased about it.  Even in his speech he said he preferred retail and acted like vanilla fans were fringe.  And that was to *announce the damn game* where he should be hyping it as the best thing ever.
---
Obviously you aren't going to see devs or management openly hating on the game they are actively making.
---
All I'm saying, and I might be walking back a bit here, is that I am guessing there are a lot of mixed emotions about Classic at Blizzard right now, good and bad.
---
same - Played Bc, stopped (life) -- picked up cata with a friend -- hated the changes / feel of it (I think they had LFG at that point but dont quote me --- but lvl like 4 mobs dropping gold and copper and linen costing dozens of gold on the AH like wtfff) money was meaningless lol
---
&gt;Population Controls: if people can select their layer you will get ones with queues, ones that are empty. 
---
same thing happens on layered realms.  worse, layered realms hold more players so playing on a popular realm is more important.  if a realm can only hold 5k players it's less important to be on that realm compared to a realm that holds 20k players.
---
&gt;Community development: Sure you will develop a community within your layer but the second you take layer A and layer B and slam them together there goes all that community you developed.
---
the only time you need to merge layers if they're unhoppable is after a layer is already dead.  that's not a slam.  a slam is when you pull out the rug of layering at phase 2 and make all the mega popular realms spread out to every other realms with transfers.  at least the popular realms in phase 1 won't have a community to be ruined because there will be far too many players to make one.
---
i started in cata and stopped in bfa. the feedback from alpha/beta looked really bad and i was trying to convince myself/my friends that it was actually fine, but deep down i was pretty upset at the idea of another bad expansion.
---
another layer of spells got stripped off my toons. my favorite classes weren't fun to play anymore. the zones were all cramped and tedious to navigate. the story sucked balls. the final nail in the coffin was deciding to play a private server and realizing what i was missing out on
---
Priest is easy to level and, great at world pvp after 40. Also super easy to make friends.
---
One thing I'm curious about that I've not seen anyone address - if you're sitting and want to cast a spell, can you? Or do you need to stand first. Same applies to when mounted, too.
---

Thanks for reading! Good luck - Showtime

I quit for a while in BfA but I'm back again, and I think the gearing is one of the biggest problems. If we just had the Heart to worry about, it'd be fine I think—at least as a general concept, I don't mind a bit of a grind. But when the Heart affects three gear slots...ugh.
---
That + titanforging nonsense is really upsetting. My brother said to me the other day, "Don't bother upgrading any benthic pieces unless they proc a slot" and I was like UGH WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT. Now I feel like I wasted my currency upgrading some of the stuff I had!
---
Lastly I'd cite gameplay/class flavor/mechanics just not being fun. LFR has become worse and worse with the harder raids, and I really wish they'd just get rid of it completely. It's not fun, it's not rewarding, and the fights are getting to be too complex for random pugs who don't give a damn. On top of this, not many people feel like their character is \*fun to play\*.
---
Me and my friends are doing this too. We are probably going Rogue/Mage/HPal for wpvp shenanigans. I think it will be strong.
---
I wonder how different this is between different countries? Because in Sweden I was living in a village in the countryside, and pretty much all my friends around 2005 had DSL, and I think some apartments had fiber too, everyone was playing games online like counterstrike and downloading torrents and stuff. I know Sweden was pretty ambitious with internet infrastructure back then, but I don't think the difference was that big? 
---
I feel like a survey of the general population of a country would not at all match a survey of people playing WoW. Honestly doubt there was more than a few people playing it on actual dial-up.
---
Funner than pally at least.  Heard wpvp is fun as a spookyboy
---
Humor, dark humor especially, is far different from Kung fu panda. Some people liked the darker feel and I think it’s hard to argue that MoP wasn’t the first big step in that direction.
---
I wonder where Bliz goes from there?   
---
Re-release content being more careful not to fuck with the original design? New IP with old mechanics because we prove they have a bigger draw and that "everyone can do everything" is a shit way to build this type of game?   
---
They dont care and just milk classic as long as humanely possible? Inspire OTHER devs to take the reigns with "Classic - MMO" genre or something where its hard and shit (no lfg etc)?
---
I was thinking to do something similar, but still use a flat table surface. A keyboard on my lap and a mouse on a chair arm would drive me crazy.
---
&gt;  Everything I've see so far (all on this sub) makes it out like it's permanent.
---
Yea, those are all of the drama queens who refuse to believe a single word blizzard says. Even though the Classic team has been providing time and time again, they continue to ignore anything they say. 
---
Layering will be getting a cooldown and it also **will** be removed by Phase two because of the world bosses.
---
That's a terrible idea. How do you get on to a layer with your guild/friends?
---
Rogue will be my main. Honestly I'm trying to find out which of the two professions would make more sense. Currently I'm confused:)
---
I will be home alone. Since my gf is starting to work that week and I took a week off. I now know what to do during the day :D
---
On evenings we play together at our desk though :)
---
But that is something that is not fundamentally protected by limiting it to tickets anyway.  So I don't see the point in limiting it for ML raids.  I agree the system should not exist for 5mans though.
---
Someone in a video said that Jaina was the best-written WoW character ever and I just about shat myself. Yeah, right? I also watched a video by a fanboy of Sylvanas claiming she was a genius that gave me hives.
---
Yeah, let's not pretend their writing is good.
---
It was a genuine question as I've only played priest and rogue. Rogue didn't seem to have near that number of buttons and I can't imagine hunters beating it. What are all the abilities for a warlock, mage, hunter?
---
I haven’t leveled a priest personally since Vanilla, but I hear that putting talent points into improved wand damage is crucial.
---
I havent played wow in a long time. Would you mind telling me which herbs sell for more than ore?
---
The mods on this sub are subjective as hell and get off on flexing their "power" as a mod. 
---
So pretty much just your average mods.
---
They will learn quickly. Every guild will force their guys to use a threat meter.
---
Yeah, but there is a difference between internet access of an entire country's population and the internet access of people playing an MMO.
---
I've been there before rolling at server launches in classic.  I'm all for temporary layering at the start as long as layers are realm specific and you stick to your layer.
---
No phasing to another layer midway through clearing your way into a cave.
---
If anything make some servers "layering disabled" so those that want to have the genuine experience of the launch day **** show.
---
I can't wait til the first time these people who think naxx is faceroll experiences a spider facing the wrong way on trash pulls.
---
Its basically up to how lazy the mod in question is that day. Ive had posts go through on day that were considered low effort a week prior.
---
To add on here, some guilds will even go the extra step and provide consumables for healers.
---
Do you like nature or death?
---
Green cards or black cards mtg
---
Did you reply to the right person? I am well aware of this.
---
Oh, you are absolutely right, will fix.
---
You do know skittish is a thing in retail right? My comment was complete sarcasm. Stop thinking threat is some mysterious thing that has been forgotten
---
You wear a set specifically made for DPS and put it on when you want to grind, then your grinding at like 1/3rd or 1/2 the rate of a normal dps. It's not great, but its not as bad as people say.
---
If you dps in a healing set you might as well just roll in a tiny ball and die
---
I’m in love with both class fantasies and flavors. I’ve been running each class on an insta 60 server and lock seems to do less damage in the blue pre bis, but seem a bit more reliable.
---
Way too low
---
If you do group quests as a Priest you will be better off healing in 99% of all cases.
---
If you're horde, the trinket from the hinterlands quest is an easy to get substitute.
---
I think if it's to truly succeed, it will need to attract a new userbase. I'm one of those 12 million but I'm 15 years older. I *might* download and play, but I'll never be able to dedicate the massive amount of time to the game that it ultimately took to run end-game dungeons and raids. And as we all remember, it felt like the REAL game started after the long grind to 60.
---
I think the same will hold true for most "old" fans who come back. It's easy to look through rose-colored glasses, and things will be easier bc we've done it before. But no matter how you slice it, things just took a really long time in Classic (which is fine, I'm just mentioning it to point out why people that are older now might not be able to really embrace it).
---
So ultimately they'll have to tap in to a younger generation, and hope they see the same value we saw in the game. And hope those players don't say, "it takes too long," or, "things are so much easier in modern WoW."
---
We will see. I think it will be tougher than you think to get multiple tanks to have a threat order with no taunt available.
---
nope, I have read about these functions in an article and made this post, because I find this to be impotant information.
---
I farmed the higher leveled areas and eventually had a Krol Blade drop. The constant other drops will ensure you're constantly pecking away at it if you don't get lucky.
---
unless they far underestimate the number of players so that every realm with layers is full has has queues, people never spread out evenly among all the realms.  some will be capped and some will be dead.
---
I'm finding reddit is full of elitist assholes. Most normal players dont give a shit about forums tbh.
---
Please, do enlighten us all with your purely objective method of determining which memes are worthy of being posted and which are not lol
---
Layers can be dynamically updated, they proved this during the stress tests. That number can be increased to reduce as many layers as possible (and to be clear, I don't think this is going to be necessary). Again, I don't believe this will be an issue, as the primary function of layers is to reduce the stress of launch and to lessen the impact of "tourist die-off". Even if there are still 10,000 active players on a server, I don't know that layering would still be required, as the *concentration* of those players is what actually matters.
---
Is it perfect? No
---
Does it have drawbacks? Yes
---
Does it get the job done? Yes
---
Not really I am a hot mess when I feel passionately about something. I think a lot of the angst around here is the waiting. People just want Classic and are venting frustrations where ever they can. I am confident the playerbase will be welcoming and helpful in general with a mix of elitists. The elitists will stay in their own cliques and will be of little concern to you. Just ride this tough patch out and it will get better.
---
2.0
---
Same. Memes could have a different sub, I wouldnt mind. But here they are just clutter. I'd rather see discussions and weekly threads than funny pictures.
---
Only you can answer that question for yourself.
---
It doesn't ruin it for me, it may for someone else. Both of us are right because it's entirely subjective.
---
"I boot lick an anti-Vanilla mechanic." Imagine being proud of that. Back to BFA with you.
---
Ulduar hard modes were the best system Blizzard had and people liked it, so they changed it like 4 times in the same expansion.
---
Dude I never considered using Unity for creating a website like this, definetly gonna try that out. Nicely done, your dungeons are dope.
---
I miss the old curse client. Now it's bloated with twitch's stuff. But I guess I don't mind it too much as I'm already used to it
---
My advice is do not base your class choice off of whats good in wpvp while leveling.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Some wotlk heroics has some challenge, utgarde gauntlet for example was harder than a lot of the TBC heroics, but they required less compositional awareness (having cc for example) which makes sense when you’re no longer actually building groups but the game is (huge mistake but we’ve known this)
---
Too much going on now. Should be in a better place in a month. Not much time to watch multiple 30 minute videos.
---
Would you please elaborate why playing a caster is funnier as alliance?
---
And that's great - It's always refreshing to come across an easy kill.
---
I don't know if the space-time continuum can handle all this irony.
---
Oaladins
---
I have been playing in the beta with maxed out graphics except for turning water down to low so it looks like classic water.  The other things look fine turned up but the Cata-style water looks out of place to me with the old ground textures.
---
8x MSAA was the highest AA available in real classic and still here, unless you plan to use supersampling via your graphics card.  I find little benefit over 4x in this game, but YMMV!
---
I don't know if this is sarcasm. Even today I know some people having regularly  internet issues.
---
Yeh I'm leaning a bit more towards Troll atm. It's a rough choice indeed.
---
You are totally in your right to think that. I do the same if I use an add-on like that. I try to play the game as optimally as possible to "not waste time". 
---
Sadly I've experienced that, that comes at a price of fun. Being efficient isn't fun to me in the same way
---
I agree with you. I think that is a huge hot button in the sub but I have seen people relay that advice in a respectful manner and those that don’t. 
---
I myself have been just letting my bro and friends know that certain spec they were thinking would have that effect but that it only matters if they really want to do end game.
---
Pick a faction to grind, or a world deop to persue. Two birds, one stone.
---
I agree. People act like things like databases, video tutorials of boss fights, and min maxing didn't exist 15 years ago.
---
It was virtually no different. It doesn't take 15 years for people to theorycraft.
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply. Much appreciated:)
---
Tragic human being
---
which private server are you going to play on once blizzard shuts them down?  One horribly scripted one with 500 ping in bulgaria?
---
I love how people are trying to call dual gathering professions non-viable even though they've been proved to not only be functional, but optimal. Gathering items that aren't vendored (there aren't that many) can be mailed to bank alts via mailboxes located in any quest turn in.
---
Your off the cuff heresay anecdote means nothing compared to 15 years of fact finding.
---
I take it you are from a private server then? If so, I agree. People from private servers will be elite. 
---
My point is the middle road of players (which I am squarely in) will probably clear it easier than Vanilla, but it won’t all be one shots
---
Haha I Just like the animations etc. I think I Will roll a Troll
---
what a douchefuck. get outta here with that OC stealing BS.
---
Best way? Depends what type of gameplay you prefer. But you shouldn’t be concerned in the slightest... mage is second easiest gold-making class.
---
DDR dance pad.
---
Perfect, now you can click your keybinds.
---
Awesome! I'm going to be rolling a troll shaman, is there anything for that area?
---
I think portal reagents cost 18-20s and you can sell portals for 25-50s depending on your server (maybe more if someone is desperate) 
---
Adds up over time
---
More like layering is a temporary problem created by a temporary solution to a temporary problem.
---
Better to make it quite clear from the get go than to have people waste time leveling Prot Paladins or whatever and then having to break it to them that if they want to raid, they need to heal, and if they want that tank stuff they are soooo far down the priority list they better give the guild a nexus crystal for not straight up disenchanting it when no one else wanted it.
---
I was talking about classic and anyone playing it who doesn't know what threat is.
---
Whether they played retail is irrelevant to my statement
---
Anything that already exists via addon (like Luna frames) isn’t a big deal it’s f they implement it IMO.
---
Just use rocket helm
---
There are far more of these type posts than "elitist" posts. You sound super rude. And i expect if this sub is indicative of the actual players that stick with it there will be loads of people accepting everyone to do everything. Or incredibly more likely in 8 months time the very same people whose post history is littered with trash like this post will have new posts complaining why are there so many &lt;insert spec&gt; people, I fully expect you and your high horse to take 40 of whoever rogers up in tradechat and attempt the easy content. If in fact you believe this sub to be unhelpful, great, nobody is forcing you to read or post here. I think it is extremely helpful when private server players give tidbits on the way things are done now, just because once upon a time we did bad things and struggled through everything doesnt mean we want to this time. I also am not planning to play the same class, so hearing what it is like the cold hard facts. I dont want fluff of how a class is in lala land i want what should actually be done to not be a bad player. I dont want to ruin the other player's experience because of my stubbornness. The only thing your post is missing is "unpopular opinion" to be meta karma farming trash.
---
WotF saved me so many times during lvling aswell. I've always played Undead so I think I'll miss it slot when rolling a Troll. That's why i'm strugling to decide. Leaning   a bit more towards Troll atm
---
Fact 1 - Mailboxes are not at every quest turn in.
---
Fact 2 - Your first toon will have fuck all bag space .
---
Fact 3 - GPH at 60 is drastically higher than GPH while leveling.
---
Fact 4 - Your plan sucks.
---
You got something on your nose there
---
As someone who's done it, it's not worth it.

I’m def optimistic

I ended up using Minion for the majority of addons across MMORPGs shortly after they got bought out by Twitch.  One thing I didn't like is if you clicked the X to exit out it would only minimize it and you'd have to actually close from the system tray.
---
Thanks for your input!
---
You will learn a lot from the experienced players.
---
Remember, vael will die much faster than back in the day.  Raids use world buffs and optimize their raid dps.
---
Ya mon!
---
I started playing when Vanilla launched originally, within a week of day one.  I kept at it for years and years with varying levels of commitment - sometimes I raided several nights a week, other times life kept me too busy to raid at all.
---
Through ups and downs I played, even WOD didn't turn me away... until BFA.  It was just too much of a step back from Legion.
---
I definitely prefer Classic most of all and then the earlier pre-Cata expansions, but as long as my friends were around we made the game as fun as we could.
---
I quit during BFA after trying to stick with it, but with most of my friends having quit by that point it wasn't worth playing the lousy content.  Can't wait for Classic!
---
Have played all the expac's to max level then quit because I didn't like it sence Wrath. Vanilla and TBC played the whole time they were current. Only tried some private servers a little didn't like them.
---
Can you show me some examples of this? Of newcomers asking questions and being insulted and made feel like an idiot. Some people have asked questions that could have been easily googled, it's that the case?
---
I originally thought priests were difficult, but then I learned about wanding and wand spec, and it is actually really powerful. Basically, wands will carry you from level 1 to level 40. So make sure you have a strong wand up until you get shadowform at level 40. Then wanding becomes less important. Shadowform will carry you from level 40 to level 60.
---
Made an account and will take a better look at it when I get home. It looks like it has some promise
---
Whatever looks cooler to you
---
Just pursue prebis for a couple weeks until DM comes out. Anything you can farm outside of DM just a waste-of-time rounding error compared to what you can farm inside of DM.
---
That still doesn't justify removing the debuff limit for Classic. Also, I never said vanilla was perfect. I know there are plenty of warts and shortcomings. But that was the game as it was back then. And the game hasn't exactly been on the up and up since then either. People want a return to the roots. If new content is developed, I'm sure most people would be entirely ok with removing the debuff limit and world buff stacking, but new content isn't the point.
---
It's real old man shit, but I don't get the whole thing. I suppose it's just an extension of our transactional culture. Throw your money in the bucket and you are part of the community. A consumer. The whole thing only exists because a few people make tons of money off it, like anything else. 
---
That said, I'm rolling on the RP server.
---
&gt; I don't agree that communities would be broken apart once layers merge,  because all you're doing is removing the barriers between players on  that server once phase 1 ends - people are being added, not taken away.  Also, you do realize that all layers in a server will merge once phase 1  completes anyway, right? The server-layer communities and economies  will all be merged regardless whether my suggestion happens or not. 
---
Layers currently share AH's, communities, etc so this point is moot in current world. In the static world you are taking server A and merging that community with the community of server B. All of the sudden you are seeing 2000 new players that you have never seen before, changing the community, economy and faction balance of both servers forever. 
---
&gt; Yes, I'm sure some layers would be more popular than others, and again -  this will occur anyway whether my suggestion happens or not. With my  suggestion though, the layers would have population caps - something I  don't believe they have now (which you could also argue would cause  overpopulation of some layers). With caps you could at least control the  flow of players. 
---
With Dynamic layers you have the ability to control where players land for the most part. Especially when they zone in and out of instances and continent as you can change their layers then and they will never know. What happens when you recruit your 4 friends to come back to Classic wow after you have been playing for 3 weeks but your server is capped. They can not join you. But with Dynamic layers it does not matter as you will be able to join him at any point. 
---
&gt; I'm glad you had a positive experience, and I'm sure for the most part  layering won't be noticed. However, that doesn't change the fact that it  can be abused by players and guilds for gold and items they wouldn't be  able to get otherwise. It would also be extremely frustrating to engage  in pvp with another player, only for them to layer-hop as you are about  to land your killing-blow. 
---
Already been addressed, they said you can not hope layers while in combat, recently been in combat, recently looted, or recently hopped layers. This removes your last concern as well as limits your first concern. Guess what in Vanilla the system was abused too, I know I was in a guild that got 90% of all the Green drakes and Kazzak. We did not care about Azure. We did it through announce bot accounts that were logged in at the drake and would announce to the guild and our forums. At this point we would log on to our alt warlocks just around the corner from the drake and summon everyone from one drake to another and kill at least 3 of 4 before anyone else knew they were there. We also would have devilsaurs and blue drakes on farm for long periods of time when not raiding to make gold. We sold close to 150 blue sinew's. So is anything layers with limitations on hoping will lower economy abuse and control. 
---
&gt; Layering IS the answer. However, I don't think Blizzard should allow  players to freely hop among them, as it causes a lot more problems than  there would be had layers have a static population. 
---
Static population initially causes all of the problems they are trying to solve, I am sorry if you are too bullheaded to see that. Static layers is no different than a bunch of servers.......the solution to the problem is not renaming servers to layers and calling it good.
---
Maybe they can have some faith in the game that made blizzard what it is today. 80% population loss within a few weeks? well see some loss sure, but how about some faith in the damn product that literally revolutionized an entire genre of games.
---
That said, Why not have layering for non-contested zones only? by the time players hit westfall and the barrens the lookylous will be gone, and it minimizes the negatives.
---
As it stands, layering will be around for many peoples entire leveling process, and its unacceptable to have such an immersion breaking process for the sake of a smooth launch and a WHAT IF EVERYONE LEAVES mentality.
---
I mean it was originally added in 1.5 battlegrounds patch, so I assumed it was coming in with them again.
---
Tartarus V2 and a Logitech mouse (I forget which model).  I don't use a keyboard when I play, except to chat.
---
I dont feel attacked but thank you mr internet man for telling me how I feel lol. Sounding triggered seems like the point of this post. Did you get told not to go moonkin for the 30th time or what? I dont understand if this wasnt in response to someone why did you post it? Do you sit around and think of responses to other's posts that make you frustrated?
---
Honestly, this.  
---
I raided Naxx in 2007 up to KT, and I've raided mythics in retail.
---
Naxx is way more stressful, especially because wipe resets take 15+ minutes, and gold was NOT plentiful back then
---
Undecided if I'm rolling horde or alli yet... I don't suppose you would know of a guild similar to this on the other side, would you?
---
Also, besides WPvP, is there any focus on world trolling?  There are more ways to bother the opposite faction than just killing them ;)
---
yes but they will log in. Then you will have 4000 people. It does nothing to guarantee a reduction of congestion in certain areas.
---
Yeah PvP
---
Raid only, dingus
---
The exact reason im running a mage first. Also, that sweet, sweet aoe farming
---
Why... :PepeHands:
---
I’m also taking the time to build the group.  Also, ideally, these items are only BEST for ME. Everyone else who joins won’t give a shit. 
---
That’s the point. Jesus Christ you’re salty af. No dal’rends for you!
---
For me, this is a tough one, because I am anti-streamer in general, but trying to watch this Classic Cup was pretty annoying with him ganking the Horde during duels.
---
With that said, this being a x-faction tourney adds issues. Once they moved it to the Echo Isles everything was good besides Cdew being flagged somehow when dueling Venruki, and Bean got killed once for being flagged. 
---
I don't think a community run event like this should get special treatment from Blizzard. Hard to keep the contestants safe even with "security" when the guy ganking people is a rogue. 
---
TL:DR; streamers getting ganked brings me joy, but I was watching the tourney and this made it less enjoyable to watch for sure. So i guess im somewhere in the middle in this specific instance.
---
They were just PANDARAN to the chinese audience.
---
That's literally an opinion
---
Dude there was a guy on the official forums who's played since launch day, got a beta invite, played 10 minutes, hated it and quit. A LOT of people are going to feel the same even if a lot don't.

I mean, I think (and hope) it'll be more successful than blizzard hopes, but 6 million minimum is crazy.

He doesn't mock at all during the announcement, but he also makes it very clear *he* doesn't like vanilla.  He also mentions being nervous, the implication being he's nervous it will be successful or nervous will flop, which you don't say if you're confident in the product.
---
After thinking about this more I think you are more correct than I've given you credit for and I am not as correct regarding my assumptions as I initially thought.  Although I still think layering is absolutely retail trash, I will try to have faith that the devs, even if they might have some conflicting emotions, are trying to bring the best Classic experience possible.
---
1-20 priest is way easier. Then it slows down, but it's not like shaman is any faster at that point. Priest is pretty easy to level and you basically never have to drink which is nice.
---
Gotcha, couldn't remember lol do you know if we'll be able to make more than one char?
---
Were reaching levels of irony not thought possible.
---
If layering is their idea of "people like the game more when there's less competition in the world," then they once again completely miss the fucking point of why we're here.
---
YOU THINK WE DO, BUT WE DON'T
---
Priests dont kill real fast, but they have zero down time, they dont have a lot a of mobility either, overall speed I consider them middle of the pack for lvling speed
---
as a nice bonus you can heal any dungeon while leveling even if not speced for healing
---
Never played Hunter at top level in Vanilla, but I know there are more Bows than Guns that drop from Raids. Regardless, I think you should just use whatever is best DPS-wise, as you play.
---
You clearly have never dual wield tanked and are just speculating. Please stop. You dont need to "make up" for the loss of shield slam.

Just a heads up. There are multiple guilds, streamer groups, pvp tourney junking all orgs using together to make servers all together so it isn't that far fetched of an idea. Same with Italians and Spanish speaking servers.
---
... Everyone totally did both 10 and 25 on molten every week.

you're either coaching it or you're allowing it to happen.

We at least have video evidence of Nef being dual wield tanked in Vanilla. The warrior doesnt topple over. So we have some reasons to believe we will be able to DW for at least Nef.
---
We got something ober 50 on roster, over 100 on discord
---
There will be RP realms once certain metrics are achieved. But don't count on their rules being enforced. Blizzard has been trying to reduce all support for this service to keep their costs down. It's up to the community to manage themselves.
---
"very weird" = exactly like leaving a cross realm BG
---
Dagger PvP spec is really gear/cd dependent, sword hemo spec is just much better because hemo scales with main hand damage and once you get a good main hand weapon then you can literally kill people with just your sword equipped. But once AQ releases then dagger rogues are going to be really good.
---
What internet did you have in 2004? Even if a tiny tiny portion of the player based had top internet wich was STILL around 2mb/s back in 2004, having leeway is NOT the vanilla experience for 99% of the people. Most people were on DSL with like 500kb/s download speed.
---
The more common experience instead of beeing able to melee from miles away in my opinion was your character yelling "im out of range....i need to get closer...im out of range" even tho you were standing on top of your enemy.
---
the only people choosing dead realms just to play will be tourists who don't want to wait in a queue and only want to check the game out for a sec.
---
everybody who doesn't want to end up on a dead realm will pick the realms that everybody else is playing on.
---

I played BFA a little bit to around level 112. The content seemed cool, but I took a break for both reasons involving the game and for personal reasons (I was getting very stressed being behind and being overwhelmed). Gameplay-wise, there are the obvious reasons that are quoted often in this sub, which I won't get into, as I think we all know what we don't like about retail. Otherwise, I just feel that Blizzard has gotten careless and lazy with WoW. Nothing seems to have taken a lot of effort (besides the art and music). I look at other games such as FFXIV and a lot of the singleplayer games and think, "Wow, this feels like quality."  I don't think that way with WoW anymore.
---
This is almost exactly my experience!  I was the MT (Human Warrior) in a Hard Mode progression "guild" on Mal'Ganis and we were constantly pushing for faction firsts.  Getting Firefighter (Mimiron, pre-nerf) is one of my proudest non-MLG moments in gaming.  We got our proto-drake and got to work on Algalon. [Watching Ensidia do this is fucking astounding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4X_zHyK6Fc)
---
Can you believe we did it?! We defeated an OLD GOD!!  We defeated Titans and freed them from their imprisonment! We would surely live in infamy astride our exclusive proto-drakes, as the reward &amp; Achievement would be "Archived" and forever unobtainable, massively rewarding our efforts and bestowing on us a pride we would bear forever.  Our gear and title marked us as the very best the Alliance had to offer here. We wore an Old God's own *body* as our armor.
---
..then Blizzard changed their minds about locking rewards/Achievements.
---
..and some fucking Goblins found **EVEN BETTER** gear &amp; weapons lying around and decided to pitch a tent as a marketplace amidst some anime-filler Tournament preceding Icecrown Citadel.
---
..and ICC was disappointingly easy and Blizzard even 3-day banned Ensidia for being Engineers w/ Saronite Bombs and downing Arthas on like the second attempt.
---
..and then an employee tweeted that they were ceasing new WotLK developments (RIP the new raids) in order to focus on the next expansion and under the direction to bring in more new players.
---
It was too much.  I lived &amp; breathed WoW and felt so, *so*, ***so*** insulted as a fan, player, and customer.
---
(Blackjak, Pokemeplx, and the others: if you're reading this, HEY!)
---
Priests are great levelers. They are just below the best levelers as Shadow, and even as holy its pretty decent. Shamans are actually somewhat slow levelers, even as a dps spec. They are not mana efficient ever, so lots of drinking is involved, both irl and in game.
---
Layer is good for the early rush.  Layers are better for the late stability of servers.  Layers are ok for the late early game when people are trying to make money.  It won't ruin the economy of worlds the way realm merging does.  It won't ruin guilds and players they way realm merging does.  It won't provide multiple hour logon queues, which people dodge by finding ways to keep their character after in server.  Layers do ruin the sense of one server together, but having to figure out a non intuitive way to group with people you want to, because there are layer hoppers that want to abuse fresh layers, is more harmful than helpful.  
---
I hope they find a non intrusive way to keep the people bitching about abusing layer hopping happy, while they allow me to group with any one I want to any time I feel like joining a new party, trade some shit or find a dungeon run.
---
That's what I'm doing!  You shouldn't need full heal spec until later raids anyway.
---
It's sad, but this is tenfold better than it was a couple months ago. In just glad they're actually talking about classic instead of circle jerking about how superior vanilla is to retail.

As it stands right now, layers only "share" communities because people travel between layers. If Classic dropped tomorrow and nobody got invited by another player to another layer, they wouldn't move. You don't phase in and out - when you log in you are placed into a layer and you stay there unless you do something about it. I wasn't aware that with layering now, the AH is a combination of all layers (if that is true, my mistake), I was under the impression each layer had its own AH. You also state seeing "2000" new players after the layer-merger, this is correct regardless of whether the layers are static or dynamic. Like I said above, let's say you and your friend end up on Server A and find yourself a layer you enjoy. You would play on that layer for the entirety of phase 1 (as long as you don't switch), and once layering is removed you would then be greeted with all the other players from the layers on Server A.  
---
From what Blizzard has said - players won't be moved to another layer unless they are invited by another player.   
---
The point you made about about not being able to join a friend if their layer is capped is valid, but this would only affect players for the duration of phase 1.  
---
As for not being able to hop layers after being in combat and looting, I also wasn't aware of this - source? This would definitely solve a lot of issues I brought up.
---
Didn't know Gordon Ramsay used to play WoW

My issue with mobile is the current mobile gaming landscape. IE: artificial restrictions that incentivise users to spend real money and get through these restrictions.

This is doubly concerning because Blizzard is not making Immortal. Net Ease is. Blizzard is basically faxing over artwork. This announcement is not in tandem with transformational hardware. In fact it's on the back of an obvious slowdown in mobile phone technology / user adoption.

D2: LoD seems simple enough, but when you start getting really into min/maxing and are competing in lvl 90+ PvP there are a lot of factors going on behind the scenes and a lot of systems at play that take significant time to understand and utilize effectively.

Sorry but I don't beleive this is black vs white, there is plently of nuance avaialble in the decision. I don't see how taking an absolutionist stance on something that can be tweaked slightly is in anyway reasonable, its actually completly void of reason. A reasonable person looks at a problem and doesnt just throw out the baby with the bath water, you look for a compromise or a solution.

Thanks !
---
IDK man i think people will seek out UD priests as well for bg premades. Apart from berserking, which is a small damage/healing gain for 10 seconds every (3?) minutes. All trolls have going for them is that once every FEW seconds ONE melee attacker has a 10% chance to get a 3 second stun, not the biggest thing. And this is a self buff with 3 charges that afaik can be dispelled.
---
WOTF is just so strong against warriors/priests/warlocks
---
it's only better when you ignore all the negatives.  which is funny when pro-layer players point out the same negatives in the other solutions. 
---
like oh man, without layers you get queues!  even though the higher population cap provided by layers encourage people to wait in even longer queues
---
&gt; There are loads of better options
---
Please elaborate.
---
I don't think they're going to face roll it, but it's definitely not going to be like the first time around. Wrath's naxx had magnitudes more exposure to players than vanilla, but thes enough similarities that I don't think it'll be long (on average) for people to get back on that wagon. The biggest issue is going to be getting used to 40 people, and instagib mechanics
---
Pre-raid should be good enough if you have a Mage, rogue, or hunter. They're not that gear dependent and benefit more from high rank abilities and CC. Obviously you'll kill faster with good gear, but you can do just fine with 5/10 man dungeon blues and some ZG/AQ20 pieces.
---
Naga and a TKL keyboard with cherry reds. Probably Corsair or Logitech.
---
I ended up quitting in legion largely because of the scaling for world content they added. Watching enemies health go up by a significant amount because i won a tanking trinket in raid is such crap, it defeats the entire purpose of an rpg
---
I'm a sucker for landscape lore. Almost all of the labeled areas have history behind them. no idea how many times I have googled a place to learn about them. Stuff like that would be great :)
---
Both.  Two servers.

You're trying to rip people off at that price. Everyone, i'll sell you five stacks of mana bread for just 99s &amp; 100c.
---
At least it isn’t 8
---
How much does the raid outgear BWL, though? I bet it's not their progression runs.
---
Of course they are, they were part of vanilla’s realm balancing efforts so it seems pretty obvious they will likely be part of classic’s too.
---
I was simply responding to the assumption made by OP that in order for layering tone removed, somehow vast numbers of people had to quit playing.  Clearly there are other options like free realm migrations to deal with the problem and not just relying on quitters.
---
This may not be popular, but I actually made good money enchanting. I was able to afford my epic mount the moment I hit 60.
---
I think it compliments selling ports and food/water nicely. I would offer my leveling enchants for free and would often receive tips for the generosity. 
---
I was pretty active with selling whenever I was in town, and the only real money maker I had (early on) was fiery.

I guess we'll find out soon enough, see you in EPL! :)

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyyHbYimW4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyyHbYimW4A) this might be the best farm if it works like on pservers
---
Dynamic respawns so a single server can accommodate the gameplay needs of several times as many players, adding servers as needed, merging later if necessary.
---
Far less damning than doing something like spinning up multiple instances of a supposedly cohesive, persistent game world on a given server.
---
I definitely agree about your analysis of skill required for naxx. Mechanically retail is far more challenging, but has a lower skill floor (LFR, casual content in general, skippable raids). Vanilla, while the top is “easier” mechanically has much more information required to succeed. Consumables, correct equipment for an encounter, general knowledge of how a fight is gonna play out (this is when I heal, this is when I dps, this is when I drop or gain threat, this is when I kite). While these tasks are simple mechanically, it’s challenging knowing what to do. However, if your guild leader and a few officers know their shit, you can (generally) get people to know their shit as well (ESPECIALLY with a decade and a half’s worth of information and research available on the internet). Everything else I agree with; 40 people is painful to put together, and consumable farming is taxing and something not many will end up doing.
---
The guilds I am playing in does not hang around after a boss kill, masterlooter stay behind, the rest starts to move asap to the next one.
---
5-10% dps, depending on the fight/gear/skill. My only experience with high level rogue raiding is on pservers. On of of the pservers dagger rogues were pretty damn good and on the other pserver they were pretty meh. So idk which is right.
---
Also as a dagger rogue you will forever have 1 fight that you will always top dps on - vael in BWL
---
I mean i got my comment removed for Racism lol. So apparently it is a racist word.
---
Yeah direct flight paths are a fairly recent addition iirc, either legion of BfA.
---
&gt;There are loads of better options
---
This has been done on private servers and it is a mess.  It leads to people camping the same 1 or 2 mobs endlessly (as its respawns are almost instant) and speed grinding it up.
---
Also leads to people mining the same nodes over and over, flooding the market with high level mats.
---
Yeaah I understand but why not ? Instead of focusing on min/max or raid.. I'm too casu for that x) just want to chill leveling and don't be a piece of meat for some class
---
I'm straight itchin, cant wait my man.
---
Moonkin confirmed.
---
I see. It's war, then.
---
That presents problems of its own.
---
Horde can talk up a good game in Classic. The events take place well before they decided to destroy their own cities.
---
Active Subs != People at launch :\^)
---
You remapping the 2 top buttons next to left-click?
---
There were add-ons thst could calculate and display hp numbers.
---
Two reasons. 
---
First, the point of an MMO is to draw you into the game. One way this is done is by digitally communicating some sense of physicality in the world. You shoot arrows, eventually you run out. You want to loot a mob, you physically walk over to him and pick up the stuff on him. Looting one mob and then getting the loot from every mob within a wide radius is jarring and is the fake nature of the world bleeding through. Instead, individual loot is an opportunity for the game to convey that you are in a physical world where space matters.
---
Second, often you'll have mobs running back to camp only to die near to other mobs, or you'll have patrols coming through, or you're getting chased. With AoE loot, you just loot near by, danger gone. With individual loot, you have to make a choice, to you go for it and risk pulling the camp, or do you loot all the dead mobs rather than run away. AoE loot removes this interaction with the world.
---
In the grand scheme of things it's relatively small potatoes comparatively unless you're planning on quitting/rerolling once you hit 60.
---
all privet servers have dynamic respawns no one have actually hade to level on a server meant for 3k players whit 15k players. and i for one don´t want to.  this means there need to be some way of handling it at this point its more a pick your poison kind of deal
---
“It’s ok to be wrong” is really something you clearly should take to heart.
---
Probably
---
Every single word you’ve ever typed is racist to someone. There’s not a jezebel or buzzfeed article about m*******s ( lmao) on the first page of google. Shits not racist
---
Okay ty ! Also priest can handle some solo pvp ?
---
That was more directed at the person who started this comment chain. My personal approach for buffs is to utilise what I can without going overboard (like logging out for days just to save a buff I got by chance etc) and not really care about the people going mental with stacking. It's not like they're needed to clear content, it's just about clearing raids as fast as possible, even if that means spending more time in the world preparing for the raid. If people want to do that, be my guest. It actually seems like more stress than it's worth, but then again, if you're going for record clear times it makes sense to minmax the game. I also feel like direct gameplay changes like that should not be considered because it really can become a slippery slope. If you can justify changing how world buffs work you can justify changing a whole lot of things about the game, but if you do, you're not really delivering 'vanilla' anymore.
---
From what i tanked on several projects, including all instances and the first few in T2.5. Druid threat is the least of the worries i had. Even if swipe is limited to 3 you can pretty much swipe yourself to victory in most dungons. To things like bosses in raids, even with full defensive tanking gear you can do more threat than full blown dps.
---
How much diffrent it will be on Classic, I dont know but i'd estimate it won't be much diffrent.
---
Then they should probably contact their ISP provider and have them fix it. People in general don't have issues with their network, and if you narrow it down to guilds that are able to progress in Naxx back in 2006 then they certainly don't bring people who regularly disconnect.
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER WE'RE TAKING MONGOLOID BACK!
---
Is enchanting just shit or something? I dont think ive seen 1 person say that are getting it so far lolol
---
Yeah you can. You don’t lose any. They just require engineering skill to use. The problem is gnomish items are BoP, so you personally have to be the one to make it. Once it’s made - you can use both.
---
&gt; warrior player with a full time job I believe that layering is better than merges, dynamic respawns, and absurd queues are worse solutions than layering.
---
I'm a "warrior player with a full time job" and I _know_ that layering is intrinsically antithetical to the _entire premise_ of an MMO.
---
By the way, you'll still have queues with layering.
---
Queues push players away, especially a big part of the returning player base that only has a couple hours a week to play. Queues are also not acceptable in today's game landscape and Blizzard realized this. There so many options for people to go play another game, that you have a couple hours at most to grab the attention of most gamers and if you do not you lose that subscription. And sitting in a queue for half of that is not an option.
---
As for layering improving server performance it does. It allows you to dynamically handle load by adding layers in modern container based programming. It definitely improves performance, it is my career designing these server clusters.
---
A lot of gatekeepers use slippery slope arguments, as if removing spell batching would eventually get us to LFR. It is just a fallacy, and not real at all.
---
10/10 times I side with a guy calling out douchebags, rather than the douchebags themselves.
---
I see nothing wrong with him telling elitists to suck multiple bags of dicks.
---
You can get away with being mostly ret and still have 20ish points for the crit-mana-return heals. Nobody who matters will care unless you are doing progression level raiding &amp; have healing trouble slowing you down. But you will not have that problem because real vanillia raids are easier than pserver vanilla raids make them seem to be.
---
Alternatively you can stack spell damage and go holy shock + seal of command... but a paladin will never farm as fast as a frost mage. Which is why I always make a frost mage my farmer.
---
Not even. You'd still have pandering garbage at the top like you do now.
---
He is referring to the fact that you are saying “funnier”, which means comedic or humorous like a joke, rather than “more fun”, which means more enjoyable or satisfying
---
Maybe you didn't play in vanilla, but tanks weren't "auto threat machines" like they are today.
---
Get ready to spam sunder armor a million times
---
What do you mean?  I don’t actually make those groups (guild groups make this irrelevant) - I was just making the argument as if I was the one in those shoes. 
---
You really need to go outside or something. You seem down.
---
I mean it is hard to tell from this video. I do not think it is a progression run, but they aren't SUPER geared. I can see hunters still using the MC bow. I can see that the MT is not flasked or world buffed, which he totally could be. I can see that the MT has ~7k HP which is less than what you would have in full mitigation gear in even tier 2, never mind tier 3. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l-s0b8oe2w
---
Like yea, obviously we don't know for certain how it will play out. But if you can have world buffs for progression, I bet people will dual wield for at least some bosses. Dual Wield has not really been what people have done for progression anyways. Even Skarm says it is more for farming and outgearing raids. Its not like every guild on private servers is just dual wielding every boss the first time they see him..... I dont get where that idea comes from.
---
You can't reach this spot alone. So it's probably not really worth :/
---
Thank you for this thoughtful reply. Those are very good points. I love enchanting but I don't see it fitting in with rogue. I plan to do a fair bit of pvp (and also for pve) and engineering will give me an edge.
---
Different generation of gamers.  Today's generation favors instant gratification, pay-to-win and playing in small bursts.  I hope new players discover classic and fall in love with it, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Try to say on this sub that enhancement shaman is not viable and you will get an irky wall of text in response that it's absolutely viable raiding spec. 
---
According to Merriam-Webster dictionary "viable" means "having a reasonable chance of succeeding".
---
Realistically, I don't think that it's a match for a newbie meme spec player in raiding environment.
---
I stopped before my resub in the first month of BfA. There just wasn't enough to keep me going and I had (still do, really) a ton of other games tugging at me. Everything in retail seems geared around skipping the game. Level AS FAST AS YOU CAN, then GET GEAR AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM RNG so you can I guess do mythic+ and GET MORE GEAR AS FAST AS YOU CAN and loop until you can't GET MORE GEAR. Oh, and there's an incredibly stupid story going on that you aren't a part of at all. GET YOUR GEAR and watch this cutscene that you have absolutely no agency in despite being the Messiah of Azeroth.
---
I'm looking forward to leveling *being* the game, to absolutely having to have a guild and/or friends, and being able to tool about the world looking for trouble with them. Good times.
---
Just want to say amazing post, you mention some very great points as to why, at the very least, something needs to be in place at launch for, again, at the very least the starting zones. I mentioned it in my post below, but I'll say it again here, I think layering is the optimal solution but there are 2 issues I would ask / hope the devs would make an attempt to address. 
---
The first is repeated interaction with the same player. This was a very fun, cool thing and really cemented the vanilla experience, contributing to the success. I don't know how exactly, but if the individual layers could be to some degree static that would be ideal. so when I see my buddy Leroy Jenkins for the 4th time, this time charging in to fight Hogger, I finally add him to my friends list and start helping him with quests. These small details were some of the things that made classic. Again, not sure if its possible, but maybe as layers are created, you can't change to another, so you're on that specific layer of that specific realm for some amount of static time. Then, as the severs slowly dwindle over phase 1 the layers are combined. Part of the fun with vanilla was seeing someone fighting the mob you needed for a quest too, and quickly inviting them to your group so you both got the quest. Having this happen multiple times with the same player, that's how friends were made and the game took off. 
---
The second issue is the end game farming of stuff like devilsaur and black lotus. There will be 60's before that first week is done, and they will do everything in their power to cheese the servers to have these spawn at rates not intended for vanilla. So long as they have something in place to prevent the abuse for farming end game mats, it should be fine.
---
BWL is harder than ZG and AQ20.
---
Nah, it wasn't me. They got to it by the time I checked.
---
ow i see, well english is my 3rd language so, errors happens :)
---
Do you have any stats showing that? Outside of when the raid launches, LFR is pretty much just for  gearing alts to be raid-ready. Out of 100s of lfr's, I've only seen a handful of wipes,I have no idea where you're getting that people *struggle* in lfr
---
Just like how they would use sharding, but only in the start area right?
---
Fool me once.. etc.
---
People are saying that a loot trade system is superior to a ticket system bc if a person accidentally need rolls it can get fixed. A ticket system would fix that and not allow for people to gang up on items for their friends.
---
Get a lotus timer and don't let go...
---
Shadowban inc
---
Nope, Azeroth needs enchanters! Enchanting alone doesn't have the bonus incentives other professions do. It becomes exponentially more viable (for gold gain) if you get a lucky recipe drop.
---
I would say look up a guide. There are video and text guides that would take pages of text on here or a single Google search by you.
---
Oh wow yea the tiny amount of people wanting to play classic they going to listen to you ain't they.
---
Except when people/guilds lose their name and identity that they wanted.  Or, there's one server where high level items weren't contested and they merge into a server where the prices are insane for them to sell at a maximum profit.
---
There are just as many issues from server mergers.  
---
Layering still keeps one AH, all the players are still on the same server and can move between layers.
---
Yea not like retail has reduced threat the whole week. Oh wait.
---
Skip everything...Roll Alliance.
---
OP has no friends?  Or they're just trying to farm some easy anti-layer karma.
---
I 100% agree with you. The dynamic layers make sense in economical point of view. Keeping up a server for a layer is not cheap, so it is smarter to only keep as many layers up as needed.
---
This looks really awesome!  Very comfy.  What class/race you planning on rolling?
---
WRONG
---
[Alliance builds a bridge]
---
Hi there, thanks for your efforts. My recruitment officer told me you reached out to him yesterday with some questions, it's nice to see somebody taking an active effort in trying to better this system.
---
So far I can say that one of the bigger pain points is that there doesn't seem to be a centralized recruitment area. There are a few discords and the wow forums, but no clear winner in 'the spot' that everyone goes. 
---
It kindof results in having to really bump your posts and do alot of upkeep everyday to try and make sure you are near the top and being seen by people who are actively looking. 
---
Another pain point is that, for whatever reason, there just isn't alot of people posting in the 'LF Guild' sections of the discords or really at all on the wow forums. I don't know if people just feel discouraged about posting their info and waiting or if they would just prefer to reach out to guilds that intice them directly, but for the most part there is very few people just posting their profile publicly for guilds to look at. 
---
On the upside, pretty much all the people we have recruited so far seem to be serious people and very excited about Classic. My guess is anyone looking for a guild before the game actually releases is pretty serious about the game in general. Overall result is we have a pretty decent core of people who are serious about the game, it's just alot of constant work to make sure we are seen daily. 
---
Hopefully this website ends up being a good tool for reciting. If it works well enough we may finally have a centralized location for recruitment. Discord and forums seem to be relatively poor methods for recruitment due to the nature of not really having powerful search functions and only having limited technical capabilities. I plan on throwing our guild up there this evening, I'll provide more feedback when we get everything set up.
---
Thanks again!
---
As Horde there was never any time for any alliance hatred, the game was ruined by the time BC came around there was little to no world pvp.
---
Also, I want to experience the story that isn't just "Go kill this, we need more berries" the horde is lacking in good story apart from the forsaken questlines. So, yeah all the great questing is in alliance.
---
Do you listen to yourself. Layers means no queues. Layers are the solution to all the problems but the nochanges people are too ignorant to look past there love of streamers to believe it
---
And stuff like this a major difference between then and now. Back then, your guild would have no idea they even needed 8 tanks for 4HM. You would spend months getting to the boss before you even realized.
---
These days you have more than a year to farm Zul'Gurub and have every Warrior and Druid in the guild get Nag Pagle's Broken Reel which gives you 10% spellhit on use. This lets you bypass the T3 requirement.
---
Begun, the pastry wars have.
---
You really are retarded, there was no threat only cautioning someone against bad behavior. Only a snowflake would read that as a threat. You really are soft, but you knew that.
---
Why?
---
But that's usa though, right?
---
I've pretty much accepted that layering will be in the game and it will probably adversely affect the player experience.  Sad, but it's too close to release to make a paradigm shift now.
---
to be able to estimate your own aggro generation without the use of 100% accurate addons could be seen as part of the skill required for raiding tho...
---
? 
---
We get no where near 12 million subs
---
Fast
---
Say there's a 2500 player server max
---
&gt; Layering with 5000 people logged in
---
* Layer 1 - 2500 people
---
* Layer 2 - 2500 people
---
&gt; 5000 people logging in without layering
---
* 1 server with 2500 players
---
* 2500 people staring at a queue screen
---
You wont be making much money off portals then.  There's bound to be cheaper options.
---
Those things were done already on pservers and they didn't have this scuffed spellbatching
---
That was pre-nerf C'Thun.
---
Top comment:
---
&gt; A lot of people saying that players were just bad at the time. Let's have a look at the phase two tentacle spawn timers in this video.
---
7:15 phase 2 starts     
---
7:25 giant claw  
---
7:45 giant eye  
---
7:55 small eyes  
---
8:05 giant claw  
---
8:25 small eyes  
---
8:25 giant eye  
---
8:45 giant claw (at this point, player is swallowed so we have to estimate the rest of the spawns)  
---
8:55 small eyes  
---
9:05 giant eye  
---
9:25 small eyes  
---
9:25 giant claw  
---
&gt; After nerf, the spawntimer was altered so that the same number of giant tentacles would take a full minute more to spawn. After the first Giant Claw, which is 10 sec into phase 2, a new giant tentacle will now spawn every 30 seconds simultaneously as small eyes instead of every 20 seconds with small eyes still on a 30 sec timer as in this video. On modern private servers, my guild with AQ40/BWL gear full world buffed with 1.12 talents would kill a giant tentacle in about 12 seconds on average, meaning we'd only have 8 seconds until the next giant tentacle spawned, so we'd only just manage to keep pace. But pre-nerf, the giant tentacles also had more HP, meaning they'd take even longer for us to kill than what they did on private servers and they also did more damage, not to mention the outside tentacles spawning and hurting players inside the stomach.
---
&gt; I can't say for sure we would've been able to kill a pre-nerf C'thun even fully world buffed. I think it's possible for some really strong guild to do it, but back in real Vanilla it was not feasible at all.
---
I recall a massive amount of elitism in vanilla. So much so that it made me a bit of an elitist too. Wait no, I think it was all the frustrating wipes that eventually made me a discriminatory a group leader.
---
layers doesn't mean no queues, devs admitted there will be queues.  if there were no queues, why even have more than 1 of each type of realm?  just use as many layers as they ever need on 1 realm.
---
no, they will cap how many layers can exist on each realm, and realms will reach that cap and then get a queue, and people will wait in that queue because everybody else is playing on that realm
---
Therez no battlegrounds on release?
---
Well, not everyone has luck with his internet provider and connection
---
&gt;The only reason people clear it fast are by fury tanking on pservers.
---
Lol.
---
Server first clear on ndale was under 4 hours. Tanks were full prot. Gotta love when people talk out of their ass.
---
Alliance Human Warrior. 
---
Alliance for the nostalgia. I raided as a paladin in Classic. Mained a paladin ever since on both factions. 
---
Human for the racials(Rep gain and sword/maces) and look I think humans look great in plate gear. 
---
Warrior cause I am going to tank for my crew. Always thought warriors were cool in Classic but never wanted to leave my main.
---
Agreed!!!....well said
---
Your post is essentially "I'm exposing myself to something that triggers me, please coddle." If you don't like streamers or streamer culture, don't watch them!
---
Lmfao why not? How does that affect gameplay at all? This sub is so petty just for the sake of being petty

**&lt;Premonition&gt;**
---
Server region: Oceanic

Looking for a semi-casual guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and just enjoy the game with like-minded players?  
---
**About**
---
**Premonition** is for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60—but at end-game we intend to raid and have a bit of PvP fun.
---
**Expectations**
---
Have a decent attitude towards everyone and understand that we all have real life commitments. Be willing to overlook mistakes and offer to help and support other players wherever you can. 
---
Be ready to run dungeons and farm consumables at max level. 
---
**Timezone**
---
We plan to raid 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week/weekend—but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Loot**
---
EP/GP or item prioritisation, but we haven't set this in concrete. Raiding is months away, and there will be plenty of time for discussion about this.

To be fair we get like 10 of those a day, the search bar is your friend.
---
It's not rocket appliances
---
Beer battered dwarf ribs?
---
&gt; I didn't conveniently leave it out. It's well understood by now, and more importantly it's not the purpose of layering so I just didn't bring it up because it's not relevant to the explanation of the goal of the system.
---
Not bringing up the cons of the system is, at best, disingenuous.
---
&gt; I would personally rather have temporary 'decohesion' than a massive and obnoxious server merge down the road.
---
Don't put it in quotes.  That's what you'll be getting-- during the formative months of the servers, no less.
---
DM is phase 2.  Someone told me yesterday that Ion confirmed 2 months between each of the first 3 phases, so DM farm should be available within ~2 months.  Many people wont even hit 60 by then.
---
thanks. I don't get the hate...
---
&gt; Phase 3 you can easily get Unstoppable Force, which will last you until you're able to get better raid weapons that are uncontested once your warriors already have raiding 2handers. 
---
2 Hand weapons are PVP weapons and Paladins get equal priority on them to Warriors.
---
&gt;DM won't come out for months.
---
...
---
&gt;DM will be out before Valentine's day at the latest.
---
Right, both of those things can be true simultaneously.
---
They have said they are keeping it in since it was already a "function" of Classic by logging out. They just made it not so clunky.
---
I think you meant to respond to the other guy.
---
Layers remove queues because you can spin up a new layer dynamically to handle the new characters.... This is the point of layering. Please link where they said there will be queues.
---
I had no idea you could do that till this post!
---
I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but I also wish Blizzard would very softly tweak a few things in regards to balancing- such as a small decrease in mana costs for Druid Balance spells and small increases to Hunter raid-tier equipment to scale them better.
---
He's actually one of the easiest bosses by far as long as people dont screw up. The reason he was considered hard is the fight is very unforgiving.
---
Melee pull aggro? Wipe
---
Tank dies prematurely? Wipe
---
Someone getting Burning Adrenaline and not moving fast enough? Wipe
---
Mechanically the fight is a joke.
---
Maybe your time isn’t worth more than that.  Mine is.
---
Find a warrior. 
---
Follow him around and give him heals and wind fury.
---
That's the truth. I mean, no one wants to admit they ate 9 cans of ravioli
---
I don't see elitist attacking people for asking questions.
---
I do see elitists arguing with the people giving bad answers to the questions.
---
Your eyes have nothing to do with it. Learn to type without looking at your keyboard and then boom you can use keybinds. simple.
---
I hardly raided in WoTlk could you explain how blizzard gave the gear for free to everyone?
---
so is it more of a "wait until later in the game where you have a bit more flexibility to obtain green/blue and mass disenchant and be useful" sort of deal ?
---
Like when I see threads talking about professions / starting in particular I rarely see enchanters mentioned. So Im just not sure if there is general consensus that its something you pick up later and drop a gathering skill (so you can get gold as you level then when you are a bit more well off you pick up enchanting) or if people just dont like it
---
Reality is apparently elitist
---
I played mage fresh on vanilla about 3 month after release. They sold for 30-50 silver usually.
---
I actually tried searching first but wasn't working it properly and kept getting the wrong info.
---
Actually vanilla-like experience with.. You know, vanilla-like concurrent player caps per layer? Rather than a Pserver like experience where you kill a single respawning mob over and over again due to dynamic respawns.
---
(I know, I know, they'll probably have it a bit more aggressive on the launch to make it a bit less of a shitshow than the original launch was.)
---
I thought they wanted to recreate the true Vanilla experience ? what is the point of those QoL features then ? 
---
Don't get me wrong, i actually like those features but they didn't keep their word and it may have an impact on those "hardcore" vanilla players
---
I assume their whaling boats would be able to withstand the journey but that makes sense. I still love the addon thanks so much for making it!
---
 It playing classic just cause of layering. I’d rather play on an old style serve outnumbered 1 to 5 by the other faction’s population.
---
Uh, threat is effectively removed from retail as a mechanic.
---
Because people are stupid and they want to be a part of that 3 seconds on stream with their favorite streamer.
---
Yikes
---
hey man i pm'd you! i think you could be a great addition for our guild!
---
20
---
I can agree with that. But a community where its ok to shit on people for asking questions is a hard nope from the get go for me.
---
I mean, i know who you're talking about. He has better gear than the stuff that drops, he just have addon called "ALL THE THINGS" that tracks everything, so he just wants the gear so he can complete collecting every item in the game.
---
&gt; It is exactly how economics works. Blizzard even uses it today in retail. Please see your own explanation below. 
---
You say it's how economics work and then say look at my own explanation that shows it's not how economics work...
---
&gt; Leads to dead servers, supports gold farmers. 
---
Mafias result from a dead server, they don't cause it. With a healthy population it's far more difficult to assert control over a market. Thankfully layering is designed to prevent dead servers from occurring.
---
&gt; Same with dynamic respawns. People will always be able to jump Layers to get more spawns if anything the layer jumping doesn't have an upper limit, as you can just jump on other toons to reset any layer timer.
---
Not the same as dynamic respawns. Only the most farmed things increase in supply, relative to who is farming it. Supply is not correlated to population like with layering.
---
Layer jumping does have an upper limit. You are time gated by spawns and layers. The fact that they are tied to population means there is always going to be competition for resources on every layer. This means that those jumping layers aren't going to see a significant increase in farmed goods. Even then, this doesn't affect the economy as it's just a difference of who sells it, not total amount sold.
---
&gt; I have; this is the case. Played on dead server back in Vanilla. 
---
Layering and dynamic spawns weren't a thing in vanilla, so I'm perplex how they affected your experience in vanilla.
---
&gt; People appearing and disappearing in the middle of world pvp was not in Vanilla. Blizzard's aim was to create an experience like 2006. 
---
And this is precisely why dynamic respawns is worse. It has a more dramatic impact on the world than layering will.
---
&gt; If you really want a repeat of dead servers that ultimately had to get cross realm battle grounds, then very later sharding; yes I agree with you then. 
---
One of the core functions of layering is to prevent dead servers.
---
&gt; No, it still doesn't read that way. It's your point of criticism about dynamic respawns that doesn't make sense. It makes sense only with static respawns, which you are advocating for here. 
---
Go start a character on a private realm with dynamic respawns and level to 10. That's all the time you need to see the problem.
---
&gt; I have, the whole point of dynamic respawns is that it can be tweaked. Blizzard uses them in retail today. 
---
And we want to keep the impact of retail as far away from classic as possible.
---
&gt;Never said that, what I do know is that layering is a short cut to improve time to market on the product.
---
If they wanted to improve time to market they wouldn't implement a new system. They'd reuse something they've already implemented like dynamic respawns.
---
&gt;Your arguments don't string together, on one hand your advocating for no change and offer a solution that fundamentally changes what the gameplay of an mmo.
---
I'm advocating for minimal change. Layering will have far less impact than dynamic respawns.
---
&gt; A solution that causes more issues, such as breaking world pvp, empty cities, randomly appearing mobs, and creating dead servers via a massive population kill off. 
---
Hey, look a list of bugs, some of which have already been fixed. It also prevents dead servers..
---
&gt; Then complain about one that doesnt o one that doesn't have an impact and offer no solid criticism. 
---
You being blind to the obvious impacts of dynamic respawns and uneducated about what layering does is far more concerning.
---
&gt; Blizzard never said no changes to the game, they said their overall guiding goal was to replicate the experience. I am pretty sure they meant the positive experiences, and not the negative ones (otherwise why even do layering). So while trying to minimize negative player experience, they also improve the positive. 
---
And this is exactly why dynamic respawns wasn't the decided upon solution. It impacts the game far too much when compared with layering.
---
Skittish is not the same as threat as an actual gameplay element. It's a gimmick that exists only in Mythic+ and only during some weeks. You also have a million stuns and CC abilities to bypass the mechanic.
---
That’s the idea.  If people want random portals, that’s what they pay.  Otherwise, there are better ways to make gold than letting johns come in to your portal for pocket change.
---
I use a Naga and Orbweaver. It's really hard for me not to use that setup nowadays since I've been using it for so long (since the n52te)
---
[No.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049)

Phase 1 has nothing formal in it for PvP. Phase 2 has the Honor System. Phase 3 has WSG and AV. Phase 4 has AB. Phase 5 has nothing. Phase 6 has the world PvP objectives in Silithus and EPL.
---
I leveled on a private server without any addon up until level 48. I used it until level 52 and turned it off because I spent more time worrying about the markers on the screen. If I need help finding a quest I’ll just use wowhead classic
---
There's one coming up soon on the 25-26 but you need an active sub to play.
---
I mean... /r/wow is full of trash memes.
---
Uhhh there’s a literally affix that reduces the threat tanks do on retail. Stop acting like threat isn’t a thing on retail.
---
Must suck to not be able to appreciate game design, but to each their own
---
No they don't. You can read quests while still leveling as efficiently as possible with a guide. For me, it's more enjoyable because I'm not wasting time wondering where to go or what to do, while still exploring the game.
---
pserver is not vanilla
---
And if you have full T2 and an Ashbringer and cannot kill anything, the problem is you.
---
God damn why do I love that stream so much?
---
Lol naa none of this post was about meme specs. 
---
Wow bigot confirmed.
---
There is definitely a need for enchanting early on too and theres no detriment in going that route. It's way easier leveling enchanting as you go but you'll kind of miss out on gold two-fold. For starters, you'll be DE'ing greens that you'd otherwise be selling to the vendor, and you'll also be missing out on the gold/hr a gathering profession will give you
---
Yea just like how classic doesn’t have a million stuns and cc and spells to bypass threat. Amazing.
---
Sigh.. So the same shitty attitudes with loot in retail will follow
---
 "need?"
---
"need?"
---
"need? xD"
---
"fu then" *ignore*
---
&gt;places insult
---
&gt;that's an opinion
---
Says the guy that doesnt even know threat got removed from retail years ago and think the skittish mechanic is somehow comparable.
---
Yeah pretty much this. First first toons on Classic, show up to the spawn and invite 3 of the other 15 people waiting around. Eventually your group will get the tag.
---
"but my guild in retail vanilla had an enhancement shaman.  Every guild but the super tryhards will take one"
---
* Play where your friends are playing.  Or, if you're looking for a community of players play with them.  Playing with people far outweighs anything that you get by min/maxing benefits.
---
* Play the race you just think looks cool and has the class you want to play.  If you have your heart set on gnomes.  Then play a god damn gnome.  Nothing sucks more than spending a whole bunch of time and not enjoying your character
---
* Horde vs Alliance really only matters on Shaman vs Paladin for a class.
---
Made me cry in shadow priest in legion for 5man content though.  Big reason I went disc in bfa (but then disc in BFA is actually super fun, or was... i quit playing early on).
---
I want to say that CTRL+R has always been a default for FPS display?
---
Agreed. Different genre at that point. No amount of "cooldown"for someone running away from me into a different parallel universe is acceptable. If I wanted that I would play other games. I want to know 100% that the guy I'm ganking is going to be around not just t minus 5 minutes from now, but know that I'm going to run into him again 6 months from now as well.
---
 I really hope they kill the idea of layers off and simply do merges if population is an issue just like they did back in the day. They are going to miss the magic of what made wow into an experience that took the world by storm.
---
First comes playing with people you want to play with, so if you have friends that are decidedly on one faction do that.
---
Second priority, if you really like a certain class/race/aesthetic go for that. That means if you want to play a Paladin, you know where you belong. If you can't stand looking at a tauren, but have to play a druid, you know where you belong.
---
Third, general faction theme. Undead have their own whole theme going on. Tauren, orcs, and trolls are all kinda tribal, bestial, etc. Alliance have actual cities that look like cities, castles that look like castles, and then giant trees. Armor actually looks somewhat correct on alliance races (compared to tauren and male orcs/trolls).
---
After all that kinda stuff, which I would say should be evaluated first, you can get into how things actually break down mechanically. Horde do have slightly better pvp racials. Alliance and paladins bring a slight pve advantage in some ways. Horde is more likely to be highly populated on pvp servers, alliance on pve servers. Alliance have slightly more faction specific quests. But you can do just about anything on either faction.
---
And a ranged mortal strike. Pretty huge advantage.
---
Correct me if im wrong, and i mean seriously correct me, but wasnt hordes onyixa attunement easier?
---
I agree. This sub has some of the worst moderation I have ever seen.
---
There's no clear and cut rules. Posts get arbitrarily removed by mods because they personally dont like the content, while other equally stupid posts get to stay with hundreds of comments on them.
---
It's abuse of power plain and simple, but there's no other really popular subreddits for Classic so we are forced to endure.
---
Thanks for posting!
---
I remember specificly being able to one button macroing in classic with castsequencing so its not really different.
---
Hunter
---
Nice. Another insult. You got me there!
---
You're right, immobilisation will not trigger the leeway. Backpedalling will also not trigger it.
---
I started on Alliance, got a dwarf hunter to 60 and even did some AV. My friends liked playing the pretty classes in the pretty zones. I quickly realized that wasn't me, been horde ever since. Ugly and evil.
---
I submitted 3 memes at the same time, one of them is on the very top of the front page right now. One got flagged. The other I'm pretty sure just died.
---
I think it's a race of how popular they get vs how quickly they are noticed.
---
There doesn't seem to be any standard for this rule.
---
Showing effort goes a long way with raid leaders. Get some of the mats on your own, show initiative.
---
lmao. said the guy using an image without giving credit to the source.
---
I think you got abused as a kid. Let me grab a hotline for you pal. YIKES
---
Cool, more meat for the grinder
---
It is also a solution to a real problem of realms having no one to do dungeons or raids with.  I lived this problem in many expansions where if I wanted to kill late heroic bosses or any mythic bosses, I had to realm transfer because no one on my realm would kill the bosses.  Group finder worked great for getting AotC in pugs, but you couldn't do that for mythic difficulties.  Dead servers drive out large portions of the subscribers just as much as a fucked launch night does.  In fact I argue, people would/will be more forgiving of launch night being unplayable, than they would be of the game content being unplayable because no one is on the realm to play with them.
---
Newbie "what is the best ....?"

Meat Slicer doesn't have a specified % chance on hit so hard to know if 2 is OP. But I agree it might be better to just make it unique.
---
Totemmaster's chest is pretty much: https://classicdb.ch/?item=11726 maybe a few agi off it would ok. Nature's ward does indeed seem over tuned looking at it again. Shadowstone is fun, maybe 10min cooldown isn't enough though. Thanks for the feedback!
---
😂
---
Damn. Hope that this someone is skilled and makes a funny tool.
---
Yeah even if you stayed frost you wanted to take the pvp talents rather than pve ones. And in my case I had 8/8 netherwind and almost got kicked out of my guild because I would refuse to spec out of arcane/fire. 3 minute mage all day
---
Do you have a source? I can't find anything online explaining that layers are created once players log in, and every time you log in you are placed into a new layer. I watched some of the dev interviews, but they say a lot of conflicting things. There still hasn't been a detailed post regarding layering, so we can only go off of what Blizzard has stated in writing, which is:  
---
&gt; Unlike sharding, players won't be able to leave the layer to find a better one when moving to different zones. Currently, the only way to change to a different layer is to join a group, which pulls all the players from the group into the same layer.
---
yeah I wish
---
I use a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 keyboard.   No it isn't mechanical, but it is ergonomic split which is important to me (try to find a mechanical ergonomic keyboard that isn't outrageous or weird...usually both...).   The lefthand side of the split basically forms a game pad anyway, so it works for me.  I get 1-6, S1-S6, C1-C6, A1-A6 without even touching letters or combined modifier keys.
---
For a mouse I use a logitech G600.  There are a few reasons I choose this over a Naga, but it really boils down to the G600 uses much higher quality materials and internal components.   I've been using the same G600 for three years now....I kill a naga about ever 6-8 months almost like clockwork.

This is an obvious low effort meme post too, but it has 4.6k upvotes, and nothing happens to it.
---
There's no way you can convince me mods on this sub even attempts to act professional.
---
Pretty standard keyboard and mouse.  I go for nice quality stuff though, have a nice vortex race3 mechanical keyboard and I use a zowie fk1 mouse.  They are pretty standard fare (not all kinds of crazy macros and buttons or form factor) but otherwise nice quality stuff (I ordered a glorious model o mouse though, it looks to be a step up from the zowie minus RGB that I can thankfully turn off).
---
There's only so far hardware will take you.  Just pick good quality stuff that'll last and you'll be fine.  Keyboards are generally easy, but mice I find very very difficult to find the perfect one.  Everything has something slightly off in my experience.
---
I've had about a billion membrane keyboards die on me (especially razer ones, fuck razer), but mechanical keyboards are pretty solid.
---
If you want to play a human, colorful human, short human, or shorter human in a fantasy game go alliance. If you want to play as a fantasy character in a fantasy game go horde.
---
No point arguing with these circlejerkers. They will mass downvote anything that isn't direct praise for classic.
---
oh man, someone referenced asmongold
---
here comes peoples unwarranted opinions
---
I like this attitude
---
I donno, you can ask him yourself, he is online in the Discord right now.
---
Ah ha! But my lego contraption keeps me and my 3,000 player multi box logged in 24/7 by pressing keys manually.  You will never be able to log into my server you insolent fool!
---
Or the raid leader uses the gold from ony kills to craft nightfalls and annihilators for the warriors.
---
Then you can have nightfall and damage
---
No, but the absolute majority have no issues. Saying Naxx was only difficult because people had 1500ms ping, 5 FPS and had half the raid disconnected at any given time is just a stupid myth. Also that people were absolute retards back then and were keyboard turning and skill clicking. That's basically claiming that if you could go back in time with what you know now, then you'd be the absolute top player in Nihilum by a large margin.
---
I've played both a lot over the years, so despite still connecting with the horde more than the alliance I've just learned that red is dead, doesn't matter what their character skin is - they are the enemy.
---
I don't buy that assessment at all, if you're referring to the fact he says chocolate icecream is his favourite, that's just him playing with the crowd. I'd say he's nervous since there's been immense pressure about making vanilla servers and announcing something as big as this will make anyone nervous, doesn't have anything to do with being confident in the project.
---
Most people think layering is trash, but see the need for it. I would love for them to limit it to zones, but I'm not sure that's possible. I just don't think layering is the end all be all of Classic like some are making it out to be. I know I'll be nolife enjoying this game upon release regardless of layering.
---
I suggest you watch the Classic panel at BlizzCon 2018 if you haven't done so, the developers are so excited to talk about how they made Classic a reality, especially Brian Birmingham and Omar Gonzales.
---
In the lore Moonkins are fucking savage guardians of Elune so thematically the ball of fat makes it scarier... who am I kidding?
---
Horde: hol up.
---
This times 1 billion!!! I so can't wait to play with modern macros and none of that /script followed by 243 special characters which in the end, doesn't work and you have no idea why.
---
Can’t say I’ve experienced alliance quests, so maybe that is the deciding factor for me then
---
salzman from accounting
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with Elitists.
---
No one wants to run the same dungeon 50x just for one Item, which is why they form their own groups and make their own rules.
---
You are under no obligation to join them AND you can make your own group with free looting if it bothers you so much.
---
Ugh I approve of the ugly and evil... makes me feel ok about being a dick
---
Depends on what you call easier.  I thought they main difference was a BRD prison escort vs a world tour hunting elite dragons.
---
Don't you think it's a bit arrogant of you to claim that if you could go back in time to 2006 you'd be the absolute best player in the entire world by a huge margin?
---
They can still root ya. Might do more damage that way, too.
---
What if 4 DPS warriors + enhance shaman did more damage than 5 dps warriors?
---
I think that people are grossly overestimating naxx.    There were tons of guilds working on it.   Just not alot of guilds actually had time to finish it.
---
\#9 is more because they don't want to dedicate people to tickets. Just trade your damn loot in the 2h window.
---
This is the second duel tourney though, which was cross faction. The first one was the level 30 one. There was a third one this Sunday
---
&gt; I’m also taking the time to build the group. Also, ideally, these items are only BEST for ME.
---
DME is going to be out within 2 months, maybe 4 tops.  If you can get an alt to 60 in that timeframe, you are a pretty insane power leveler (though I wonder why you aren't spending those ~240hrs gearing your main and just farming on them)
---
Oh ok your the alt lmao good to know
---
Bosses turning around and facing the wrong way can have consequences other than killing the retard that can't manage threat you know.
---
And the dragon Isles will be the next expension
---
Thanks, I'll have to check it out.
---
Hell fucking yeah brother! See you in Azeroth!
---
Thank you
---
There was something about a /camp function? Which could be used to get back at the entrance, and it's not there in Classic
---
What ranged mortal strike? I do remember hex of weakness affecting healing but wowhead has it as a curse of weakness basically.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25816/hex-of-weakness#comments
---
Look at the options alliance has for flight paths in these zones:
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
Badlands
---
Feralas (specifically, proximity to DM -- lol @ alliance either swimming or running through horde town to get to DM)
---
Felwood (specifically, proximity to quest givers)
---
Thousand Needles
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Those are pretty glaring, and of lesser concern:
---
Think about getting to Ratchet, WC, RFD, or RFK as alliance. They're in the Barrens. You have to run through Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Think about getting to SFK or SM as alliance. It's a longass run.
---
Think about getting to Mara as alliance (Horde base is right next to Mara, awesome if you're a farming hunter)
---
During leveling, Horde just has more bases and better-located bases. Several alliance bases don't even have a mailbox. At max level it's more balanced: Kargath+UC vs IF for access to Strat, Scholo, BRM, and Naxx... but then Gromgol (with its zepp) for ZG and Thunder Bluff for AQ.
---
yeah u can download it, it has alot of mods and addons for many games. u can also watch the streams with it ofc.
---
There already is, but it's only for 1-40 for Alliance and 1-34 for Horde currently.  I'd link it, but I'm on mobile at work.  Search on Curse.
---
ah, another Hunter weapon
---
I'm really glad we made this bro, people seem to share the enthusiasm for this lore too!
---
I read 95% of quests and for the 5% dumb written quests like that I look it up in a DB.
---
I highly recommend you watch the South Park World of Warcraft Episode S10E08 Make Love Not Warcraft
---
Warlock
---
Oh for sure, if it's a brand new experience for you I couldn't recommend using leveling addons.  For those of is who have been at it for 15 years...Well, you do you.
---
Death knights killed it for me. I didn't like the PvP gearing (resilience), so I twinked a few characters at 59. The issue was everybody and their mother had a 58-59 death knight decked out in their starter blues which were better than the TBC greens and blues everyone else had. As a twink I had no issue killing them except for the fact that they took a ton of time to kill, they had dots that continued damage after they were dead, and worst of all, you couldn't ignore them due to that dumbass death grip ability and pet stun. 
---
One or two death knights per game, both pulling you in different directions and stunning you? No problem. Seven death knights on the opposing team? No thanks.
---
Horde has a little more of an interest in silithus, since they’re dealing with that stuff since at least the barrens and 3/4 of their races live on Kalimdor.
---
Alliance is way more vested in the stuff going on in Blackrock Mountain.  
---
The only major plot point in BC was Nagrand, so score one for the horde there, and after WotLK faction was mostly a matter of whether your leader is a bloodthirsty warmonger or a king with crazy vengeance driven advisors.
---
So for your proposed solution you just crash any server over level 30?  There can't be tens of thousands of people in a single server at a time.  There can't be two hundred people in a single zone at a time without the server going down and the experience gets degraded rapidly once you go above one hundred.  It would be kind of super bad for the game to have an acceptable play experience, until you put in two or three IRL days, and find out the server system they used at the start, can't or isn't used for the entire game.  
---
It would be like playing in a bubble, until entering the non layered worlds, where you can't get more than 10fps and under 400m/s latency.
---
I’m not sure the complaint is so much directed at no memes as it is directed at the subjective nature of low effort vs high effort memes.
---
Hehe. I have an idea...not sure if its possible doable.
---
What about a toggle that says "Race related lore". That way if you want to see the lore, regardless of which race you are playing, you can.
---
You can see the first two with addons. They were not part of the original UI. 
---
Some addons used to guesstimate how much health the enemy had based on your damage to them and % changes. 
---
I believe with the new classic system you should be able to just see the health now though.
---
Yeah, they'd be dirty closet alts that I never tell anyone about.
---
Bot is drunk
---
Usually it's a mix of fury and prot.  When you become way over geared for the raid then you go fury to retard strength your way through the fights.
---
If you make it so the tanks have to go heavier on damage mitigation the fights won't become drastically harder.  The hardest part of raiding is learning the mechanics.
---
For your last question, you will find better answers in the modern version of the game since we're using that client
---
I'm think horizontal progression would be the way to go, with future content in Azeroth compared to Outland or Northrend. There was a lot of cut content from Classic which could potentially be repurposed. They could start with that and work from there.
---
&gt; suggest you watch the Classic panel at BlizzCon 2018 if you haven't done so, the developers are so excited to talk about how they made Classic a reality, especially Brian Birmingham and Omar Gonzales. I truly believe they love this project.
---
I'll do that.
---
It's entirely possible I was looking into Brack's announcement more than I should have.  And like you said, even if he was negative on Classic at that point, it was two years ago.  I still think it's probably a lot of conflicting emotions for them, but in the end it doesn't matter and I shouldn't be making assumptions.
---
I think the problem with layering is that it's kind of a scale tipper.  I love vanilla, but it *is* a game from 2004 with plenty of imperfections even in its ideal state.  The gameplay and experience *needs* to be 100% for it to be successful.  Something like layering, if it hurts immersion and the social aspects, might be enough to make WoW Classic too tough to swallow, especially if it loses the feeling of a cohesive world like retail.
---
Queues and overcrowding suck.  But at the same time, they do give you that natural feeling that something important is going on.  It's like being in line for an exclusive night club.  Yeah the line sucks but the anticipation is intense, and the chaos when you get in is memorable and exciting.
---
Did you listen to them, they said they have to look for a solution that balances huge queues and sharding. This is layering. It will limit or almost eliminate queues. Yes but this cap initially will be significantly large than a the 3k vanilla cap. Also listen to your video they explained how each zone is still it's own "shard" but they built continuity between the zones in your layer. So that when a player runs from one zone to another they will not shard transfer to a different world but stay in the current world. This is how it layering improves server performance as each zone is it's own container(server) that has it's own resources.
---
@OP I don't think you quite understand. It's not their "analysts" that underestimate Classic's potential, it's the shareholders and moreover Activision. Classic wasn't made for gamers in a living room as much as it was to appease businessmen in a boardroom. Blizzard knows -damn- well how much of their dwindling fanbase wants Classic, but Activision doesn't care or doesn't know that same passion. Furthermore they won't until the servers go live. And even when they do go live they (Activ.) won't care. This monstrosity isn't Blizzard making decisions anymore, this is what Activision thinks gamers want.
---
Standing on top of other players and blocking npcs. Don´t know how long this is subjective.
---
Yes...as in that’s the argument the player making the reserves run would use. 
---
Hence the “in their shoes”
---
level as enhancement untill at least lvl 40, then you could go ele if you want.  
---
Use rockbiter if you're using 2-H, Flametongue if you find a brand new 1-H.
---
Spacial voice chat where you only hear voices of the players with their characters close to your's. The further away they go the lower their volume gets until it eventually mutes totally. What a fucking mess that would be :D
---
There was no collusion on my server, just a lot of competition.  I was the 2nd person to get R14, and the first person only beat me because they had two people playing the same account.  I literally played 18-20 hours a day and slept 4-6 hours a night for weeks on end.  It was a thoroughly unpleasant experience.  One time one of my primary competitors asked me how I keep going (first time we had ever spoke directly).  I responded with a single word... marijuana.
---
That damn flicker bug making me crash to desktop forced me respec, then I just said F it and went with a Static Strike Movespeed Crit Oro's with Inpulsa's and Three Dragons for phat shock clear speed on a Slayer.
---
Long story short, *nope*!
---
&gt;antithetical 
---
Never heard this word before and multiple people are parading this around. Must be somebody popular leading this pitchfork army used that word?
---
They should make it so you can inspect people farther than what it currently is. Even if you do manage to inspect someone, if they run farther away, the information on the items don’t show anymore.
---
From kinda old asus chromebox.
---
From what I see as the general consensus from the community on this sub, LFG will almost entirely be done through the servers discord channel.
---
You’re talking about in general, but also specifically?
---
Did you even read what I originally said? This whole thing started because people act like retail has no Idea what threat is.
---
I didn't said that internet was the only issue... And how old are you if I may ask? I started playing shortly before TBC came out. One reason I couldn't play it back then was that I already was happy when a site was loading fully. Our Internet was really bad (and we also payed for every kB we used which was kinda expensive). When I finally could raid with lvl 70 I had major issues with my pc performance. I healed Gruul's liar while looking down on the ground as this increased my fps immensely. Also, many people died because they barely saw things like fire on the ground, because they had graphics on low settings. I remember doing Hyjal first boss and half the raid died, because they didn't see the fire they were standing in. And the countless times I had to (re)start WoW again because it just crashed randomly and left a "WoW Error" window open ([https://images3.imgbox.com/b5/42/mbktjT2v\_o.png](https://images3.imgbox.com/b5/42/mbktjT2v_o.png)). Maybe the majority had no problems at all, but man there were still a lot who had those problems.
---
Sounds cool to be (assuming it's good enough to pry me off of classic.
---
I don't think you understand what "viable" means.  
---
But keep on keepin on hating how other people play a video game.
---
Vanilla version will be 1.12, this lfg feature will not be there.
---
I mean, let's be honest, AoE loot was one of the better changes to retail. You can not want something in Classic but still acknowledge that it was a good change.
---
They are not mutually exclusive.  If everyone was bad at something, even the best would still be bad.  Take the best chess player from 1000 years ago.  He's the best in the world!  He's still not Magnus.
---
Yes. That is also a thing in retail. Stop acting like classic is a complete different game. 
---
You have addons that literally show where you are on the threat meter but also want to talk about how hard it is? Come on.
---
You're lame AND hypocritical.
---
Lmao Why are you so salty?
---
I quit during vanilla, played EQ. Came back during vanilla and stayed through WOTLK. Quit to play EQ. I came back again I think sometime during Cataclysm and stayed into Pandaria (that was next right?). Whatever expansion came next I think I tried it a bit but when I realized they destroyed PvP, I was done for good. I've been on private servers since, and every few years, more EQ (progression servers). This past year I've played on a vanilla pserver (currently), two TBC pservers, and one WOTLK pserver. Ready to dump it all for Classic though.
---
Yeah. Still I will lvl with daggers and play at max lvl with them. Ii like their playstyle more and it just feels right for rogue.
---
Thank you!  This supports all regions, I just need to find guilds outside of NA that are interested.  Be the change you wish to see, register your guild you DrunkMelonPan! 
---
(Great username btw, have me a chuckle imagining it)
---
They already announced that layering is temporary for phase 1. So it will be killed by Blizz when server pops are more stable.
---
But it's not found in any of thesr concept maps as opposed to nazjatar.
---
The point was it felt forced in instead of part of the concept map of OG wow.
---
You’re in for a rude awakening come launch. Layering doesn’t fix overcrowding.
---
Healing a warrior doing what, btw?
---
It has hot swap switches.  So it just depends on what switches you want to put in there.  My speed golds are nice and clicky, but I like clicky keyboards.
---
I've got the ALT and CTRL.  I'm more a fan of 65% keyboars to give more mouse space.
---
I'm actually going to be building my [Quefency](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-60-65-split-staggered-keyboard) with the 10 button macro pad on the side since I finally got my Holy Panda switches I ordered MONTHS ago through a group buy.

So yes...they are not a viable spec
---
Gnomish mind control cap
---
lol Sounds about right. I think the collusion helped people get more sleep.
---
I don't think they did much pvp, but I was friends with an apparently top progression guild MT, and he and his little brother would multibox their characters in shifts.
---
As has been mentioned, dynamic respawns cause two problems: One, it throws the economy out of whack because there are so many more mob drops/leathers available. And two, classes without heals/escapes can easily get overwhelmed by constantly spawning mobs.
---
Yup. There's going to be a lot of people somehow expecting the exact same WoW they played to be produced into Classic WoW, as if nothing has changed in the past 15 years.

What makes it the arguably the "best" profession is not the things that you make with it so much
---
its that its the only profession that requires you to have levels in it to use its stuff, you can buy the best potions and flasks stuff in the game and use it.
---
But not so with engineering stuff
---
Yet 90% of org is still made of dirt
---
I thought release was Tuesday?
---
Well, I only played MoP while leveling to BfA and while everything was more colourful (which I personally liked as it was a nice change from the usual colour palette) the actual story and quests were kinda dark at times.
---
yeah depending on the addon you use
---
Two mice. The first one is the Logitech G903. It has terrible reviews because it tends to develop the double-click problem. But if you get one from a good batch, the G903 is dirt cheap right now.   
---
The second mouse is a pretty basic vertical mouse from J-Tech. Swap over to it whenever possible, and will (mostly) be playing WoW with it. Because it keeps your wrist in a more neutral position, while a regular gaming mouse keeps your wrist locked in a pronated position.   
---
Speaking of wrists, for keyboards, I'm using a Mistel Barocco split keyboard. Again, the idea is to minimize wrist strain associated with lengthy play sessions. Though you might not want to use a 60% keyboard for classic WoW because it slightly reduces the number of macro buttons you can use, it's something I've adapted to.  
---
I've also been considering trying out one of those macro-mouses with a millions buttons, see here: [https://unreasonablereviews.com/classic-wow-peripherals/](https://unreasonablereviews.com/classic-wow-peripherals/)
---
You're saying threat meters aren't needed in classic. They are. They aren't in retail because it's not possible for a dps to overaggro. That's all.
---
This is pretty much drivel for a new player. No one who hasn't played before will understand any of what you said.
---
Plenty of good answers above, OP. Play what looks more intriguing to you. That's all that matters.
---
What about the large percentage of the player base that started during vanilla that never got to do end game stuff, like me.  Got my first 60 a few days before TBC launch.  I came up with a lot of people like that who are all excited to play classic "for the first time".
---
Dungeon runs (getting 3 DPS is a dime a dozen) which if doing living strath runs you can get orbs.  In some cases both you and the tank can reserve the 1st and 2nd orb drops and DPS roll on the 3+ drops.  
---
Any sort of farming area to farm materials, essences, reputation grinds (want a winterspring tiger easier?), so the warrior can just go ham and pull multiple enemies and whirlwind/cleave them.
---
Warriors, in general, suck to solo farm and if they get a pocket healer they grow in strength exponentially because you greatly reduce their downtime between NPC pulls.  It's a win/win for the both of you.
---
I'm going to be playing a Warrior myself and my first thing to do at max level is to find several pocket healers to farm with.  Probably going to end up running tank spec to do dungeons, so having a Tank/Healer practically means instant queues and setting loot rules, cherry picking classes as well.  The same can be done for the healer.
---
I dont think it should.  It artificially dumpsters hybrid specs or certain classes because a part of their toolkit is avoided for the sake of premier casters getting their raid debuffs.  
---
How much more competition would there be if ferals could use their massive AP scaling bleeds or if hunters could use serpent sting, or more ret paladins getting to judge bosses with different seals.  
---
The no change initiative for that is so the rogues and warriors stay number 1 for the life of the game.
---
I play every xpac to max level, which takes me a while , then usually call it due to time constraints. Classic looks like it will be amazing, but if I have a hard enough time dedicating to retail, classic won't work for me, unfortunately.
---
People who want this likely are the tourists.
---
&gt; It makes me sad you don’t see the value gained due to layering 
---
Hello Server is full.  Position in queue 19,473.  Estimated time remaining: 2h 15m.  
---
Hello lefty929-anacrhonos.  
---
Hello your material stock pile crashes because you have merged with another server that has five times your amount of mats from mass farmers that you never got to compete with.  
---
Hello you can never find a group for stockades, because there are only 41 people online for your faction, only 1 within 10 levels of you, when you decide to log in for a non weekend night.
---
The most bittersweet feeling in the world is a boe epic dropping that is really good for your character, but not BIS. Selling an upgrade will never feel right, but even worse is replacing it next week with a dungeon drop.
---
I expect the answer to this to be yes. 
---
It's proving difficult to find out when they actually introduced 'mouseover' as a macro.  When they added target markers in 1.11, you could run a script to get mouseover to set those.  So even if it's not, you should be able to do what you used to do for mouseovers.
---
Looks like [this](https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/535/classic-macro-apis/3) thinks it has been clarified already.
---
They are. I'm saying that if you, right now, go back in time (and take your knowledge with you) then you're saying you'd be the best player in the world by a large margin, because everyone was a moron back then. I'm sure Magnus would beat everyone from 1000 years ago in chess. I'm also sure the best players 1000 years ago would beat regular players today.

Did you vendor everything you gathered or were you selling on the AH?
---
It doesn't solve the mana problem.
---
Not if they're going server first Rag.
---
Alliance Dwarf Paladin
---
I generally pick the “good guys” in any game. Always had a fascination with “Dwarfs, Dwemer, Etc”. I see Paladins as righteous, team leaders and have always been excited for the idea of holy warriors in any game. 
---
I played this exact combo in Classic back from 2004-2009. I plan on doing the same with the exact same name. Super stoked.
---
Fellow couch/recliner gamer here, is your mouse pad balancing on the arm or does it attach somehow? I've looked far and wide for a good couch arm mousepad, but thusfar they've eluded me.
---
Legion. I made a demon hunter and did the first questline to get my artifact weapon, then stopped. It came out when I was just starting my first real career job after college graduation. The game wasn’t as fun as it used to be and I didn’t have the free time anymore.
---
it was just a regular goldmine cave like the one in elwynn
---
I raided with Juggernaut for 6 years. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of records left of the guild's accomplishments and this typically overshadows them.
---
Some Deets
---
* Juggernaut started on Doomhammer prior to moving to Mal'Ganis.
---
* These screenshots were taken over something like a 3 month span.
---
* The guild had the same core members for a majority of its lifespan.
---
* Completed original Naxx prior to TBC.
---
* Completed all of the game's current content while the guild was active.
---
* Had at least one world first and some top 20 kills.
---
* Ran non-guild individuals through raid content as a reward for large donations towards opening gates of AQ.
---

---
There's always a debate on whether or not this style of leadership works or why anyone would put up with it. People weren't expected to put up with it. They were expected to improve or wash out and get replaced by one of the millions of applicants waiting to take their spot.
---
Juggernaut was not a casual guild. It was full of MMO veterans and competitive gamers. People kept showing up to raids every night. Content kept going down. Quite a few of us are still friends over a decade later. I'd say it worked out.
---
Raid leader: Hey, we need you to drop a mana tide totem.  
---
You: I don't have that talent.  
---
Everyone: ...
---
I'm talking specifically about hunters vs melee. The only Hunter to pair against a melee there lost first round. Add to that, a tauren Hunter and you're just handing melee a gigantic advantage
---
You FILTHY alliance. DIE. LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Tailoring and engineering yo
---
Which is nothing but server merges without the name hassle, which is irrelevant anyway as they've handled that fine on retail. 
---
If you think cutting the playerbase off from each other for months, rather than just single sessions is a good option.. I don't know what to tell you.
---
that is funny because every mmo on the market has multiple servers and shards to handle people logging into an area.  Wow has the least instances anywhere for the amount of area they cover in terms of Kalimdor and EK.  
---
I guess you really quit playing MMOs after wow came out and didn't experience anything else?
---
I was in my teens when WoW was in beta and everyone I knew had a PC that could manage WoW raids, and ADSL was common back then which is plenty fast to play WoW without bandwidth issues.
---
it's undermine, not pandaria
---
Oh, that's funny because I have 5000 hours as a Priest and what you're saying is only correct if you're both playing to bounce aggro. If the Priest wants to keep aggro, they can. 
---
I'll dm op so that they know you really were just making shit up.
---
Because it is replicating what we had in vanilla except we don't need to contact the GMs to do it.
---
People in first world countries knows what war is and they still don't have any experience with it because it's not something they have to deal with.
---
One of the big ones I've seen are being able to have both enemy and friendly nameplates show at the same time, was especially difficult as a healer back then cause you had to switch between them a lot
---
Me too!  Part of the time anyway.  I'll be at my desk a lot but I'll have my laptop hooked up to my 60" TV so I can play from a recliner too.  I have a Table Mate tray table so I can slide it right up in front of me.  Voila!  A flat surface for my keyboard/mouse/hands and a nice cushy throne to relax in while I quest, farm and fish.
---
I'll only do dungeons &amp; raids from my desk though.  There's a certain feeling of control that's necessary for that stuff.
---
You sound like a gigantic pussy. Big wake up call for you when you hit 60 on the classic servers btw.
---
The first guy to make fire was the best in the world at it.  It still doesn't mean he was any good at it.
---
So do you create x "static layers" per server, and they can choose at the very start?  Or do you dynamically add more as more people come online initially?
---
I am better than this :P I have a couch chair without arms (actually is a part from a corner couch) and I also have couchmaster  [https://www.amazon.com/COUCHMASTER-Ergonomic-Couch-Gaming-Cushions-Mousepad/dp/B00CCHRJ2Q](https://www.amazon.com/COUCHMASTER-Ergonomic-Couch-Gaming-Cushions-Mousepad/dp/B00CCHRJ2Q) 
---
On a 40" TV, in 1 meter in front of me.
---
You underestimate the power of no lifers
---
All of these things are exactly how Vanilla worked. How exactly are they "not okay"? Some people on this sub were on private server for way too long, and have really bad memories of Vanilla, or they never played Vanilla at a high enough level to notice these things.
---
The problem is that fixing these things has a major knock-on effect on class balance and PvP. This is literally just how PvP was back then. It was broken and frustrating. Things happened that didn't make logical sense. Melee sometimes feel inescapable as a caster, yet as a melee player you felt like the game was always telling you "out of range". Dancing in a hunter's deadzone was a total crapshoot.
---
You always felt like you were fighting against a broken system that was only barely able to handle the game as presented. That's what Vanilla PvP was. That's the Vanilla experience.
---
[whoaaaaa](https://media.giphy.com/media/SDogLD4FOZMM8/giphy.gif)
---
I think 2 warriors 1 shaman would look better.
---
False, we will burn your forests and eat your tasty mounts.
---
I mean...then you have nothing to worry about. You can just make your own groups and not reserve anything. Hooray!  No need to cry on reddit!  Hooray!
---
This was the early LFG system. You went to an Innkeeper and you could sign up for a dungeon. It didn't care about roles, just who signed up. So no one used it that much because no point in a 5 DPS group
---
I don't know about power shifting, but on the beta my mouseover kick and blind macros work just fine
---
TB respect!
---
I think there was and option in 1.12.1 Questie to remove objective markers from the mini map at some point and it just left "?" but I dunno if it can be hidden on the main map. Would be a cool feature actually.
---
Depends on the guild. Non-casual guilds aren't going to humor the holy paladins if the warriors need ranking weapons or general pvp-items.
---
&gt;It is known from the story of the Plague of Undeath that humans settlements in Northrend existed. Alexandros Mograine mentioned that "Whole cities have gone missing" and that "Northrend is lost". The human trappers of the Grizzly Hills living and working at Silverbrook and Hollowstone Mine have Russian-sounding names, indicating a unique culture, and do not have a known origin. Wintergarde Keep was built over an old human village dating back before the Alliance Vanguard arrived to the Dragonblight.
---
I mean ye, I guess if these people could and Arthas could, trolls could just as well. I'll add it.
---
Thanks for the kind words, hope the final version won't disappoint you either :)
---
Most the people setting speed level #goals will hit a wall around level 30. If you're not enjoying yourself by then sorry haha.
---
Will do
---
"Nobody knew how to use it"
---
People knew exactly how to use it, you click and it puts you in a queue. The problem is that it fucking sucked. You could easily end up in a group of 5 rogues.
---
What? Hunter beat rogue and warrior in the first round...
---
Where did I say threat meters arnt needed? 
---
It is possible for dps to over aggro. There’s a reason why last week was a difficult m+ week. Wanna guess why?
---
Which means that your claim is that you'd be, by far, the best player in the world if you could go back. Which is pretty arrogant of you since you wouldn't. It's also pretty insulting to the ones that actually were the best back then since they were really good at the game. You're acting as if thottbot and theorycrafting didn't exist.
---
Thats good news. At least then the 2nd wave of "fresh" servers later on will be an authentic experience.
---
Yes, mouse over works in the beta
---
The elites will clear it no problem.   
---
The average AQ40 guild will set foot in it...they'll go in to "farm trash for easy upgrades before starting progression" then they'll "go in for a few practice runs"...then they'll get down Rasuvious and maybe two other bosses, then they'll fall apart from burnout and/or better guilds poaching their few good players.
---
The average non-AQ40 guild will have their better, more ambitious players will find pugs for Naxx trash, get the upgrades they can there, and then quit or get poached.
---
The tiny amount of people wanting to play classic? If there’s such a tiny amount wanting to play classic, I’d like to know how many people are actually playing BFA right now 😂😂
---
I don't see how layering will hurt the social aspect that much since you'll be assigned a layer and then that is your permanent layer unless you get invited and switch temporarily.
---
Even with layering there'll probably still be queues and overcrowding, it just won't be AS bad. I want overcrowding, just not the overcrowding and the queues that will happen without layering.
---
Doesn’t shanker proc fuck up the debuff limit?
---
Is group loot a thing? (Multiple dead mobs looted with one go)
---
Only in the US? Or am i overseeing something in my client? (eu normie)
---
DoTs were pretty powerful even in vanilla. Health pools were a lot smaller, comparatively. It was pretty common to die to the DoTs even if you managed to kill the warlock.
---
It causes some issues with clashes (Dustwallow Marsh is important for humans for one reason and for races of the Horde for another reason), but I'll think if I can still implement it somehow. Thank you for the idea!
---
Well if they're competing with other guilds for server first, world pvp will obviously put them at a disadvantage.
---
Lets look at some numbers.  A quick google search of "Classic WoW Info" gives this subreddit as the 3rd entry(Easy to Find).  There are 148k that have liked it.  Thats 1.85% of the 9 million people you think are going to be playing Classic.  You're telling me that 98.15% of the 9 million people are who are SOOOOO HYPED to play Classic, can't be bothered to like the Classic WoW Subreddit?   Secondly, this is a quote from when the sub hit 100k likes.. "Similarly, the sub set a new record for unique visitors in a month with nearly 800,000! Again, this only counts the first 18 days of May, so this number very well could reach over a million unique visitors by the end of the month."  It likely broke 1 million, with another 48k subs from May 18th to now, I'd guess the unique viewers per month is likely somewhere around 1.2 million.  While I can't be exact with that number, I can say that its not even remotely close to 9 million, even by being overly optimistic.  Now, are there people who haven't been to this subreddit that are going to be playing classic? Sure, but I don't think its going to bump that up by much.  Hop on YouTube.  Search for Classic WoW videos and scroll through the view counts of all of them.  Do you see multiple millions of views for each one?  No.  Most are about 100k.  The ones with the highest view counts are Class Picking Guides, which makes sense, seeing as they can help everyone.  I'm going to play a hunter, so naturally, I'm not really watching a lot of videos on the other classes specifically.  842k views is the highest one after a quick scroll.  That number is also, no where near 9 million.  I'd like to know where these 9 million SUUUUUPER HYPED people, that can't wait to dive back into classic, then stay subbed for a year, are at.  They aren't in the classic wow subreddit.  They aren't getting HYPED on youtube watching the boatload of classic wow content videos.   Where are they?  If there were 9 million people waiting to play Classic, Blizzard would have had that shit out yesterday.  They would have already announced TBC and WotlK Classic.  I hope you're right, I really do.  I would personally love to play TBC and and WotLK Classic servers as well.  There just isn't any evidence that shows anywhere near those numbers.  I'm hoping that they do another sub stats @ 150k subs and that happens around the end of July so we can get the number of Unique Visitors for July.
---
Not worth my time otherwise.  If you want to port for peanuts thats on you.
---
Absolutely, don't dictate what I **NEED** to do while I am in game, why not let *ME* decide that. I came to the world to spend time with friends, not log in to work a second job.
---
We’re probably going to see a lot of use on the trade and lfg chat channel.
---
Provide a source? Lol are you that clue less? Look around you. Check out the stickied post about layering on this sub. Everyone hates it. Either you’re trolling or obviously a dumb tard.
---
Which means that except for this week in m+, threat doesn't exist.
---
Fantastic news for me. Thank you for this!
---
Bows, because I"m going NE Female.
---
It's a shame there are no ways for a rogue to drop aggro, reduce aggro, or aggro reducing talents available.
---
There is only 1 faction and that's the Horde.
---
I think it's because our latency was much much higher back then, so it didn't behave the same way.
---
^^ Modern mythics are mechanically more demanding.  Naxx is still way "harder" to finish and a thousand times more stressful.
---
It's not necessarily that DoTs are less powerful than in TBC, it's that if you can't go SL/SL, and like you said you also don't have UA.
---
The result is you don't have access to as many spells that even are dots. If you go for Siphon Life, you're squishier, and most importantly of all most of what you do can just be dispelled before it even does anything meaningful.
---
That's why Warlocks go for burst options in vanilla instead. It's just more reliable. The dots basically are there for a bit os sustain and incidental damage.
---
Queues are acceptable in some shitty free private server, but it's totally not acceptable when you're literally paying a monthly fee for the service, lol.
---
I agree with you man. I've been there. Not in retail WoW but I've had my fare share of dead pservers and mmo's in general. I'm just trying to point out that layering is temporary and not permanent like many here assume.
---
So you're saying that even if they were Absolut shit at the game, they were still better back then than you are currently. Meaning that you're shit at the game currently?
---
you act like I gain anything from posting it here. I did not know that it was part of a video and just wanted to submit content other than shots and memes to spark a discussion.
---
That's not how that works. A login queue just slows down the logins. It's not waiting for people to logout. 
---
You really need to learn what a login queue is. It just reduces how fast you can log in. It's not waiting for anyone else to leave. It's just slowing down the flow because the logic servers can only handle so many authorizations at a time.
---
RP-PVP is my bread and butter, love role-playing and clashing head to head with others. Sincerely hope at least 1 is rolled out at launch!
---
its wow but instead of 1 character, you have two.
---
its just the same.
---
Yup ended up with perditions blade and CHT before I got those so guess became a dagger rogue instead.
---
When you say solo content, do you mean like quickly doing normal content for a solo player or doing content usually intended for groups solo?
---
The former, yes, non-hybrid classes handle that kind of content much better. The latter, the hybrids can be stronger than the pure classes.
---
Hunters and Locks are kinda good at both.
---
Glad to hear I’m not alone. Luckily I have always had a soft spot for Tauren lore and aesthetic.... why can’t their be more zones like Mulgore?! I’m NA West so unfortunately we won’t share a server.  Love the blend of professionalism and passion that is evident in all your work. Keep it up &amp; thanks again.
---
Yeah I like it. Glad I created this thread. Tailoring/Enchanting was almost my go to however I can DE on my bank alt and use my mats with other enchanters. I was unaware of some of the Pre-BiS gear Engi gives me too.
---
Yea even though it’s been in the game for 4+ years. 
---
You can’t say it doesn’t exist and then say it does exist but just a short time. Like what? You’re confusing yourself.
---
+1 please jesus spread this wise man's word
---
I want to be able to come home from work and play the game, not sit in a 4 hour queue then go to bed.
---
With a fresh 60 rogue I was pulling in ~40g an hour with just raw gold + extra from dark iron, potions, and (dis)enchanting materials.
---
If a 1g portal can save me even 5 minutes of traveling its more economical to pay the poor sod trying to sell portals all day.
---
It honestly might be a LOT less profitably because the servers and population sizes will be so tiny in comparison to private.
---
Vanilla holy priest - main tank healer. Rolled alchemist and had 7 alts in various areas only to gather herbs and mail to main. Used major mana potions the second they came off cooldown. Went through a ton of them. Guild never provided me any, though. Always asked me for them. I started charging for them. Ended up making a ton of gold that way.
---
So theres no reason to stay gnomish then. Guess that makes things simpler lol.
---
Before you could layer hop freely based on who was in your party. Now there's some invisible cooldown applied to you if interact with almost anything in the open world.
---
What about my post would make you think I am triggered, I forgot about you (much like your father) already.
---
Always said for 1-10 zones with maybe 10-20 zones as well but past that no. People who haven't actually played vanilla for the past 5 years on private servers or more don't actually know how much layering is going to ruin the sense of community and pvp early on.
---
Really? Who states that that's the "core tenet"? If an MMO doesn't include that, is it still an MMO? If so, then it's not a core tenet. If not, then what genre are they? Is doing instanced content suddenly shifting genres? Is Minecraft an MMO by this tenet?
---
Back up your claim.
---
B-but we said #nochanges... REEEE
---
I used to play horde back in TBC as troll priest &amp; hunter. When I learn about Nostalrius I wanted to experience something else so I rolled an alliance druid. And with the classic I'm going back to horde to yet again play a class I didn't play before.
---
You see I can't really play the alliance if I want to roll a shaman, plus trolls are my favorite playable race in warcraft. There are no gnolls on the alliance so there's no reason for me to pick it.
---
I don't care about the faction pride.
---
I played since day 1 in vanilla and I quit approximately when TOC was released in WotLK. For me personally, the game went from being an awesome immersive world where you'd raid and have fun with your friends/guildies and be challenged every day into chores of farming daily quests and facerolling through dungeons. I remember very clearly that I had a feeling of WoW becoming more of tedious work that I hated but had to do for a couple hours every day rather than something I would log in to play because I enjoyed it. My heart broke a bit the day I announced to my guild that I'd quit raiding and become a social instead, but I just didn't enjoy it one bit anymore. 
---
WotLK just felt so off in so many ways. We just came from TBC which had some of the best content ever created (especially Sunwell and Magister's Terrace) into a remake of Naxx and the introduction of TOC and Archavon's Vault. Dis-to-the-appointment (don't get me wrong - Naxx is the most amazing raid ever made. But for some reason, experiencing it again in a new lvl 80 version also felt off at the time). Terrible content. Even though some of the raids were decent - like Ulduar - the overall gaming experience was just not there anymore. So in the end I quit, and I've barely played since.
---
Maine says hello.
---
Is vigor really needed for a seal fate build? 
---
It's been 14 years, but the only time I ever put points into Vigor was when I had the set bonus from T1 that gave me 10 energy because 120 total energy sounded alluring, but I'm not really seeing the allure of having 10 more energy unless you're also running w/ the T1 bonus. 
---
That said, Seal Fate was on of my favorite builds. You built up combo points like mad and didn't need the best gear for it to work (speaking form a dagger rogue back in the day, [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxM0ttAZhfVboZV) is what I **think** I ran with all that time ago).
---
Dots were by far the most powerful in Vanilla.
---
a man after my own heart! Tauren are by far my favourites!! An aesthetic that the others can barely compete with ;P
---
aww man thanks so much for your kind words! I really appreciate it &lt;3
---
I can understand why they decided to do it.  They wanted to attempt to allow people that never played classic wow a chance to put up with the annoyances and bugs and shitty decisions they had at the time.  
---
I am with you in thinking they can recreate the same technological landscape, by delaying calculations of spell casts and not take into consideration that everyone will feel that the game is slightly off or delayed with every spell input.
---
My point being, I'm arguing with some people in this thread who are saying this, but I don't think it's worth taking them seriously. I went for the lazy answer for your post, my mistake.
---
Thats what i said tho ?
---
I just set my hearth to Kargath, Badlands. Problem solved.
---
Thank you, precisely what I'm talking about, 10-20 minutes is justifiable, also you wont always get 10-20 minutes, it will happen some hours, you'll probably get instant-5 minutes half of the time even in a 60/40 server and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
We want to prevent extreme levels of queue times without implementing cross realm.
---
You’re not going to sell any portals in Classic.
---
You're the only person who's confused. The concept of "don't go all out DPS in raids because you will overaggro and wipe the raid" does not exist and hasn't for a while. This means it's an alien concept for players new to Classic. Because in their frame of reference, overaggro only happens in specific m+ dungeons and isn't in the game otherwise.
---
Ask your legal guardian to explain it to you if you still can't grasp it.
---
I play by immersion. I see myself as my toon more or less. So for me it’s alliance since I am human.
---
Streamers aren’t allowed to have a normal life? Maybe something came up and he is unavailable.
---
Care to explain how that would work? Why would imbalances lead to a negative feedback loop? I'm honestly curious, it might seem I have overlooked some facts.
---
People are really sleeping on the fact that you need gear to beat these bosses.  Even if a boss is tank n spank, you can't just stroll in there and down the bosses with your fresh leveling greens.  I think the raids are going to be much harder than people expect.
---
This should've been the crowd pummeler from gnomer...
---
That saves me a whole lot of addons I was going to install anyway, not even mad.
---
Let those warlocks shine baby
---
Frigg off Donnie you weird spiritual bastard
---
Yeah you couldn’t be more wrong.
---
I don't think past 30 it would be very necessary.  They just wont be enough people in a zone to require more than 2 layers anyhow.
---
It doesn't have to be the majority, just a large portion.
---
Doesn't really matter what you think. Layering is in, and that's an objectively good thing.
---
Ahh yes ok, While not a full mortal strike it is useful and another thing for pvp to put on the Troll list
---
While I'm in favour of layering, we need to clear some stuff up.
---
Phasing works by subdividing each zone in Retail WoW. "Layering" is the same this as phasing but they did not did not want to invest time in subdividing the zones for phasing and instead made it continent-wide. 
---
They haven't explicitly stated this, but I suspect it's because they have no intention of keeping phasing/layering and so didn't want to invest the resources into a better phasing experience. (Perhaps they were just lazy, but I'm willing to give the the WoW Classic team the benefit of the doubt since they are working hard on many other aspects of it)
---
Blizzard has a terrible track record handling server merges. I played on a server that died going into BC and got even worse going into wotlk. The merges come years too late and your character is stuck in a single player game unless you want to pay $15 more to play with other people.
---
Puggin raids is not a all a rare occurence. MC will be pugged a lot after phase 2. I have (shamefully) played pserver and all my raid were pugged. Did not have time and schedule to commit for a guild run
---
He spoke about fishing in the sommer, maybe he went on a holiday? :)
---
There is no method, either no memes or all memes gets banned.
---
I dunno. I base my opinion on the fact that heal paladins are quite tanky and got quite a lot of livesavers to go through to actually kill them. Some of the pvp oriented youtubers more familiar with vanilla than me when talking about which class to choose said that paladins can outlast a rogue handily while shamans are easier prey. I guess we shall see.
---
You've missed my point, which is that your comments were extremely short, unhelpful, and blatantly untrue. i see why op is ignoring you now. We're done here.
---
They've already said why they're layering instead of sharding - sharding breaks the continuity/ambience of the environment, because players will disappear at the zone borders, so it feels like Classic.
---
Layering has no impact on the feel of the game, since by grouping with your friends, you will be on the same layer. I mean, it does have one major impact - you'll actually be able to play the game at all, even when the servers are busy on launch day.
---
People have two major complaints about layering, that I've seen:
---
a) The economy will somehow be broken if players who zerg to 60 take advantage of layer-hopping to get resource nodes. I'm not sure if that's a possible outcome, but the people that will impact if it happens are essentially only other people who have zerged to 60 to farm resource nodes - everyone else will have access to those excess resources at the AH, or in their raiding guild, or whatever. If there are two layers, and twice the population, and twice the resources, but they all share an AH, there is twice the demand and twice the supply for goods. Prices will be as though the server population was 1/2 what it actually is.
---
b) "I'll be irreparably triggered by having my 20 friends online, not in a party with me, but not visible when I'm in the same zone as them, this isn't Classic, reeee!"
---
Just as an anecdotal response regarding warlocks: 
---
I was pretty young when classic was around (maybe 12ish years old?) and my older brother and his friends are the ones who convinced me to play. Of course I didnt really know what I was doing, and asked my brother what class I should play. He gave me a long, awesome explanation of just how cool warlocks are and how good they are at everything, etc. Oh and they can summon people so that's pretty cool. After years of playing and good memories, my brother finally comes clean one day and told me that him and his friends orginally just wanted me to play a Lock so I could summon them and they wouldn't have to interrupt questing/farming...which I ALWAYS did. And it was awesome. I mean yea its convenient when the meeting stones turned into summoning stones, but warlocks lost a huge piece of their class identity. I mean yea they were always expected to be there and summon, but every single class had its niche that was expected from them. It was unique. And that's what ultimately happened to wow retail, everything just became a homogenized mess with no class having something that REALLY makes them unique from every other class. Oh well, that's my rant lol.
---
Thanks to sheep like you. Great way to ruin classic.
---
Discord is going to make finding groups and communicating so much smoother. 
---
Will be interesting having horde/alliance spies on each factions opposing discord listening in and reading chat.
---
Well I got a lot info out of this thread
---
Hard to balance lvl 14-15 blues when there is so few in the game to compare to. It might be that spellpower is simply not something you should get at these levels. Anyways you are completely right about keeping an eye on powercreeping, could wreck the experience making it too easy.
---
I know for a fact if it's in the game I'll abuse it for an advantage.
---
Lmao that's what you get for playing dps tbh
---
You are wrong there. Intellect increases spell critical strike chance which is a direct damage increase. Furthermore, mages do go OOM throughout Vanilla raiding. As an additional note, the troll racial has a 3 minute CD. The gnome intellect racial is always there, meaning you benefit more often from it.
---
&gt; Items will be released accordingly to their original release patches:
---
If a [Sword of Smash] had 10 agility in 1.2, and in 1.8 they change it to instead have 10 strength, and that's the version that was in 1.12 before BC hit, then you will have the 10 strength version of that item when it is released in the phase it is introduced into the game.  The 10 agility version will never make it to Classic.
---
I'd say you remember it correctly. A fresh 60 warlock with low spell damage has very weak DoT damage. However, the damage scales well once you get more of it and maybe even use a spell power trinket like Talisman of Ephemeral Power. Same goes for shadow priest. Also: No resilience in vanilla that could lower the damage, only resistance which you have curses for.  I think around 450 spell damage equals to 4k damage as SM/Ruin lock when you apply Siphon Life + Corruption + Amplified Agony at full duration. Not entirely sure, but I think that base spell power level is achievable with r13/BWL gear.
---
&gt; your blowing out of proportion
---
1. You're*
---
2. No, I'm not. At pserver launches with 8k+ online, starter zones were borderline-unplayable for 1-2 weeks after the server launch.
---
And yeah, all things considered, Layering is the least-bad solution. There is no 100% good solution that will please everyone and keep "muh immersion".
---
DoTs were more powerful in TBC than vanilla for sure.
---
In PvE it's mainly due to increasing available debuff slots, as well as deep Affliction tree DPS getting buffed. I believe DoT scaling may have been buffed as well, not entirely sure though.
---
In PvP it's mainly due to warlocks being given an additional "trash" debuff in Shadow Embrace to cover the other debuffs from dispels. But also the addition of Resilience allowed Soul Link warlocks to survive long enough for DoTs to get more than a few ticks off. Well, until season 3/4 where warlocks were again getting trained by 2 physical dps with armor penetration and damage inflation from too high item levels.
---
Yo wtf... this is exactly the [same as my video ](https://youtu.be/sbGAOyeSWF0) (and in the same order) 
---
Nice work lol
---
I think you have to reconcile your priorities. Is it to immerse yourself, or be completionist? I don't think you can do both.
---
The immersion aspect for me isn't just about reading the quests, but about not having too many loud UI elements telling me what to do or where to go. No arrows, no highlights. Just a body of text I have to read, and then as I move through the world most UI distractions go away. This is something I've missed about Classic and other old open world games (Example: Morrowind). Yes getting lost can be frustrating. Conversely finding your way after getting lost is satisfying and feels like a real experience. And most importantly it was a much more engaging experience. Without UI help I'm constantly forced to think, analyze, and make decisions. With something that approaches retail UI elements, I don't really do any of that. I follow the arrows, sticking to roads or flying as much as I can, then I just do what the quest text says. It takes the open world element, and puts it on auto-pilot, as I can just turn my brain off. You might as well turn my travel time into a loading screen.
---
Why do you care what someone says on a video game?
---
Agreed. The fabric of WoW is immersion, people being so willing to trade that for layering is bizarre to me
---
Look man, you don’t talk about him like that!  These two obviously have a special bond!  A bond!  Something you’d never understand!  Do you know how many bits he’s given?  How many subscriptions he’s bought?  He’s obviously earned the right to be deeply concerned frostawhatsit hasn’t shown up!  How would you feel if your wife just didn’t come home one night?  Multiply that by 10 and maybe you have an idea what this guy is going through.  
---
Man, some people are so inconsiderate.
---
There are plenty of guilds in between hardcore and pug - most of them will probably have a raid leader than will notice if your class has a raid utility talent which you don't use when asked to and reduce your dkp for it if you don't respec for the next raid.
---
This idea does allow for more drastic changes. Plenty of people feel that Naxx gear is overpowered and doesn't leave any room for improvement but people naturally wouldn't want the gear they worked so hard to get to be nerfed. But if the nerf happens on a fresh server? Then nobody will have the gear to complain about it.
---
Til 5 minutes is more than 7 hours. Thanks for explaining /r/classicwow
---
Devs don't see the value in anything that's why they rebooted a 15 year old game and you clowns fell for it.
---
Yeah, can't even be mad though. It's a tough slog for warriors in the beginning. It'll be interesting to see what the warrior population looks like down the road - I can't imagine a ton of them are gonna be the terrifying one's that are decked out wrecking balls.
---
Like it’s my fault if ppl post without reading. Then again it is all of maybe 5 sentences I guess I should have put tl;dr for all those that can’t read more than bullet points
---
Layers themselves are fine, layer hopping should not be allowed. Just too much shit like this exists and lots of it will only be discovered after launch.
---
I played Alliance during Vanilla, literally didn't know WC, RFD, or RFK existed.
---
Personnaly i'm in no hurry and will enjoy the trip. Been there, done that. Also rolling on pve.
---
I'm an old monkey with some hours a week to play, no stress at all. :)
---
Yea you can play on those with the 40 whole other people on them lmfao
---
It hasn't just been losing subs every year, it fluctuates. There was an interview in a magazine last year during Legion where someone from Blizzard said the game was back up to 10 million.
---
Dude I do that with my hands too!! It's so habitual that I like cant stop now lol
---
1. End punctuation goes within the quotation.
---
2. “And yeah, all things considered, Layering” You don’t capitalize mid sentence.
---
3. Refusing to look at alternative is so short sighted it’s stunning
---
Lol. You’re gonna have 400 people in starting area with you in your layer, regardless of whether layer was locked or not. Just like you’d have 400 in server if there were no layers.
---
Layering doesn’t affect the overcrowded beginner areas.
---
When you're playing vs people who have it, why put yourself at a disadvantage?
---
You are completely correct that a lot of prebis guides are using items that came around around patch 1.3-4 as prebis. I don't think we really know in detail how strict blizzard is going to be with releasing items with the phase they came out, they were pretty vague in their post. Like yeah of course we won't have naxx gear or things like silithus gear, but if blizzard is going to be strict and not allow 1.3-1.4 items in phase 1 I really cannot say for sure. To basically take the lists with a grain of salt as for now, until we get a clarification.
---
Great. Now super rare spawns with loot that is meant to be really unique and the best hunter pets in the game have a 10 second respawn time. So immersive!
---
AND. Many guilds didn't WANT to finish it, knowing that The Burning Crusade was right around the corner.
---
The blind trust people give blizzard still. I'll believe it when I see it.
---
See now that it’s been explained that way I totally understand and get it. Haha. How many videos have they watched to earn free bits? Hours HOURS!
---
I've been saying for a while, I can't reasonably state Blizzard *wants* Classic to fail, on account of they're spending resources to create it, but it sure as hell seems like the folks holding the purse strings for the project absolutely *expect* it to.
---
Which is bad enough on its own, but then you see all the discussions around here in which it seems like so many expect player retention post-launch to be something like 5% *at best.* They talk about the population decline not just in terms of its probability^1 but its massive scope. It's like it's become an article of faith among for some folks that the game has absolutely no chance of being anything more than a passing fad.
---
Which is certainly a possibility. Not one I personally agree with, but I'm not arguing it can't or even won't happen. It very well may. However, the alternative of Classic finding a stronger following than these people expect is *also* possible. I even think it somewhat likely, as there's a market for the sort of game Classic is which has been utterly devoid of alternative options for many years now.
---
Again, this is just my opinion and I'll freely admit I've no notion of the *size* of that market beyond its almost certainly being rather smaller than that served by more casual and/or easily accessible fare like MOBAs, battle royales and mobile games. I don't think that necessarily means it's a trivially small market, though, just one that needs a bit more careful targeting in order to be profitable.
---
Probably by an independent developer that doesn't have shareholders breathing down their necks. Which is why, as excited as I am for Classic (or *was* before the bean counters decided to sacrifice authenticity on the altar expediency via phasing/sharding/layering/whatever they're calling it this week), I'm really just hoping it can be "good enough" and keep me entertained until development on Pantheon finally wraps.
---
^1 ^Which ^is ^entirely ^reasonable; ^tourist ^spikes ^and ^subsequent ^leveling ^out ^of ^player ^population ^happens ^in ^literally ^every ^high ^profile ^game ^launch, ^Classic ^will ^be ^no ^different.
---
I mean.... I'm Just ready to play classic WoW, they'll do what they are gonna do and I'm just gonna deal with it so I can play the game lol.
---
It was added in 1.4, so by all accounts it'll be in phase 2 with Dire Maul, probably 2 -3 months after release. Unless you're no life levelling it'll be available when you hit 60 or soon after (if you're a raider).
---
Seriously. Anyone who buys Warden Staff after Dire Maul is released, is a complete idiot. Unyielding Maul is a free dungeon drop and has literally 99% the same stats. You're paying 400+ gold for +10 armor. Even considering that it becomes +28 armor in dire bear, that's still like.....0.1% extra damage reduction.
---
That I know. The confusion was whether or not I got the actual availability of the items right - since every single guide i see always include items from later patches as "Phase 1 pre-raid bis".
---
Guess we'll have to agree to disagree. 
---
Troll + Power Infusion + all their DPS cooldowns will come through higher DPS on the same fight than the small amount of flat +crit Gnome gains.
---
There are sims that show as much.
---
But I play video games to escape from responsibilities :(
---
Like 1.12, the summon stones in Classic do literally nothing.
---
Hey, from NH here as well.  a few friends and i(maybe 6-8) of us will be returning to classic as well, planning on rolling ALLY on a PVP server, what's your bnet tag? i'll give you an add. wouldn't hurt trying to get everyone on the same server. we range from 25-35yrs of age, most with many years of raiding and pvp experience.
---
Lol or u can continue to feel the need to justify your conflicted verbiage to complete strangers
---
Yeah, Keftenk and Zephan ran calculations. See this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c97ubd/by_the_great_winds_i_come_classic_balance_druid/
---
Keftenk said moonkin aura boosts a group of warlocks dps in early phases by 100 and mages in late game by 150. I think his units were groups and not individuals for those dps increase estimates. 
---
I don't think boomkins outdps mages, even if you factor in group buffs. Happy to be corrected though.
---
Finally someone with the correct memory. Sl/Sl warlocks were op in s1-s2 because resillience didnt decrease dot damage and melees didnt have armor penentration. In s3 and specifically in s4 double melees were stomping warlocks to death, felhunter died at the very first second of bloodlust etc.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
Seems to be accurate at least to the best of my knowledge spending a whole lot of time playing vanilla wow. Don't really need another guide/list tbh.
---
But i haven't heard anything about the phase thing you've listed. I just heard the content release phases. so dire maul items won't be in until phase 2. but items later added to the dungeons that are already available in phase 1, will be available in their 1.12.1 stats. 
---
If you've got a source for this claim I'd happily read into it and admit me being wrong.
---
^ This.  We know what dungeons will be added in what phase, but that's really about it.
---
He misused the world itemization. He meant to say item release schedule.
---
So you have no counterargument and are now resorting to insulting me. Thanks for admitting defeat! Reported and blocked. :)
---
This [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761) yet?
---
Ah ok.
---
Thanks, this seals the deal.
---
"Only 140 more hours of herbalism before I break even!"
---
Or ppl could post viable info not restating the post and title
---
Yeah, maybe a single fight. If you are min/maxing you are doing it for the entirety of the raid, all bosses + trash. A gnome will outperform a troll in an entire raid scenario.
---
The game will be pretty sick if layer hopping is locked down
---
No, it doesn't demonstrate that.
---
Can Nova Scotia be considered New England?
---
Can I get a link to the blue post you're referring to here? I can't find it.
---
In in the EU thats close to ye olde England, will that do?  ;P
---
Post made it's way onto r/popular.
---
I know a good method. You can have a feature where users can vote on a post to indicate if it is good or bad. Posts with many good votes go to the top and will be seen by many people. Posts with bad votes don't.
---
only in the make believe world of everybody spreads out evenly among all the realms
---
Thats not argument being made.  Im saying you dont need it, and in my experience it wasnt needed to successfully raid.  Now if you want to use it, go for it, but it's notnecessary.
---
I posted my source, go complain there... wtf
---
Wowclassicbis.com is also inaccurate. Check warlock for examples.
---
Kinda reminds me of J.K. Simmons' character from *Whiplash*.
---
On Private Servers thus far Warden Staff is usually not more than 100g around launch so its easy enough to snap up when people are around lv50
---
That just might be. Just don't want to go chasing items that have not yet been released due to faulty guides =D Classic will be time consuming enough as it is \^\^
---
"LFM HEALER X DUNGEON AND G2G" copy paste it now buddy.
---
Hyperbolic nonsense.
---
&gt; It might be that spellpower is simply not something you should get at these levels.
---
You can look to the randomly enchanted items. I think they often come with specialized spellpower.
---
Well, yeah. Capturing the original feel of the game is more important than the exact numbers. Hardware and network speeds have changed dramatically, so a perfect recreation is already out the window. Many things in OG vanilla wow were tuned assuming higher latency, frequent disconnects, and poor hardware.
---
Things like onslaught girdle weren't added until later phases/patches that wouldn't come until phase 2 or 3?
---
Still disagree, and most hardcore raiding guilds would disagree too.
---
https://imgur.com/edbMBuV?r
---
Also, theoretical DPS has gnomes very very low. Unless the gnome racial has changed drastically in MoP vs. Classic, Mage is not the higher DPS option.
---
You genuinely think that having 5% more mana on trash pulls is more of a DPS increase than popping up to 30% casting haste after getting power infusion'd.....?
---
Pretty sure I heard them say in an interview back in may that this was how it would work, so the social aspect didn't get as hurt.
---
No I'm not, what a lazy conclussion, trust me, I'm trying to be as objective as possible and if my two options would be 30min +  queue times and more or crossrealm, I promise you I would choose crossrealm everytime, I never once said I would choose hours of queue time over crossrealm, all I'm saying is if there is another solution that prevents 30min+ queue times or more without implementing crossrealm then we should look into that, if there isn't, then by all means, crossrealm is the way to go.
---
And yes I know how big the queuing time issue was, hence the point of my solution is to both fix the queue time and not implementing crossrealm,
---
Warden  Staff is BiS for bears
---
MCP is BiS for cats, but you need about 2 bags of them for a raid evening.
---
**NA - Horde - PVE Guild in the making**
---
My friends and I are coming back for WoW Classic and we're trying to set up a locals guild. If you're from the NH or New England area and you want to have a group of people to play WoW Classic with send me a PM. Hoping to recreate that awesome social experience that WoW was for us when we were teenagers. We'll end up raiding end-game but if that's not your thing feel free to come along just to have some people to game with and maybe make some new friends along the way.
---
I started out this post arguing with you, but the more I thought about it I kinda agree with you. So I deleted what I had and started again.  But what your describing is not really elitism, its just understanding what a given toons endgame role will be. As a side note, my argument centred around my flatmate who levelled an ele shaman in vanilla and raided as ele with a very occasional stint as emergency healer when a regular healer was missing.
---
Also, do you get XP from doing BG's under level cap?
---
By the time ICC hit that trinket wasn't BiS so you didn't need to run it for that gear though. I will say trinkets were the more challenging pieces of gear to upgrade so ToC was nice for that otherwise alot of people had to clear the first wing of ICC to get decent trinkets.
---
For the uninitiated: https://youtu.be/BUAI6ABS3-U (plus other videos on that channel)
---
I don't know shit about Runescape.  If it doesn't have a persistent world, then I'd say no.
---
You can do it if you don't mind a lot of corpse hopping.
---
What I'll say is that there are a number of elite quests that become unworthwhile (aside from completionism) if you can't stealth them because otherwise they take too long for the xp and/or reward.
---
why didnt you just link the article then?
---
Naw I’m truely angry when ppl post no info as the first comment did like I hadn’t thought of that already. “Streamers can’t have normal lives? Maybe something came up?” Ohh no shit omg I hadn’t thought about that how could I have been so stupid. If you don’t have info on the topic or post that isn’t speculation don’t comment
---
Vanilla azeroth's size and scope and diverse climates makes the world feel massive. When breath of the wild came out they kept talking about how massive the map was and now there's no loading screens when moving freely around the world and you don't have to load into buildings. And I'm scratching my head thinking "wow did all this in 2004"
---
No
---
sharing an image is not the same as presenting someone elses image as something you made.
---
one is what he did. the other is what you did.
---
Nope not back then. I remember running all four lockouts every week for a while.
---
It had a debuff for most of vanilla. Racials were added in 1.1 and then in 1.4 Blood Fury had an attack power debuff after the buff ended. 1.9 changed it to the healing debuff.
---
Is there a list of essential addons for Classic? I’ve seen a bunch if posts/videos with ”list (part 4)”, no definitive list.
---
I’d never switch. It’s just a personality thing for me. I’d never play horde because the races are wayyy to animalistic/ugly/evil-looking
---
Specifically talking about pre raid.
---
Dark Advisor's Pendant
---
layering is the only thing that will let you do a low lvl dungeon at the 6 months point without having to hop to a different realm like introduced in wotlk.  you won't have population sticking around if you want a "TRUE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE OR DEATH"
---
&gt;Also, Unyielding Mail is exactly the same except it trades 1 extra stam for +10 Armor and +2 defence. Absolutely insane to think that those extra stats will make a lick of difference over 400g
---
Unyielding Maul is comparable, but still worse. When a item is Best in Slot it's worth whatever you want to pay for it. It's not like buying Stockades Pauldrons which will be replaced in MC. A Warden Staff will last a Beartank forever.
---
We played Alliance and wanted a change of scenery, plus the alliance on our server sucked at pvp so that was frustrating.
---
Switching was fine. It was fun and didn’t have any problems.
---
Now for the go around we’re leaning toward alliance again for full nostalgia reasons.
---
Ouchhh sorry for your lost XD
---
Nothing wrong at all! I love the fact that in Classic your reward for murdering a bunch of kobolds is some cheese.
---
Well youre the one talking about PvP.  I dont bother with battlegrounds and arena, and timers arent gonna matter in world pvp.
---
So we're talking apples and oranges man.  Different worlds, so it's all good.
---
So you're both stable geniuses, is what you're saying?
---
I'm pretty sure it was actually Bis, I looked up EJ guides. Specifically for ret paladin, one of the "bis" trinkets was tiny abomination in a jar which NEVER FUCKING DROPPED.
---
The other being toc trinket.
---
And no, Saurfang's trinket wasn't bis, fuck it was worse than some valor trinkets cause it had ARP.
---
Was that the private server addon, or is it for classic
---
I hear ya, but it’s also pretty cool to think “Hey, I wonder if there’s a quest giver in this back room in the tavern. Maybe I’ll go check it out.” If you find someone, it’s all the sweeter. If not, well at least you did a little exploration and can look at it from an RP perspective.
---
What is / is not "essential" depends on how you play, but at the very absolute least, I would get:
---
-unit frame addon
---
-auction house addon
---
-WeakAuras
---
-Quest helper addon
---
Was it Ion's tweet on the subject?
---
I would always let that priest kill your targets with wanding to get spirit tap.  
---
You can always head to the next target with that warrior (you probably already have aggroed).  
---
More mana = more health = more rage = more dps = more mobs low = more killing blows = more mana
---
Wow is basically “cowboys and indians” (excuse the term) you decide who is evil :)
---
The upsides have been mentioned, and should be easy to figure out:
---
1. Layers can be thought of as scheduled server merges. If 100 people show up Day 1, and 50 of them leave by Day 90, your server has 50 people. If you let 200 people show up to the same server, and 100 of them leave, your server will have 100 people. Now change the number to whatever the optimal server cap is - 4k or whatever.
---
2. Lots of people are going to be angry if Classic doesn't feel like Vanilla WoW. Sharding doesn't look or feel like Vanilla WoW, and you see it constantly. Layering means that what you see is indistinguishable from Vanilla WoW, and you don't have to queue forever, and the starter zones are less crowded. Crowded starter zones, and multi-hour queue times, are suffering for no tangible, or intangible, benefit.
---
Ye, im not sure either, thats why I want some clarification. My latest source was a tweet that someone linked me from a classic content manager regarding this - but i cant seem to find it!  Someone asked if we could assume similar release plans from all patches - and the answer was "yes". Im sure someone knows what Im talking about and can find this..
---
I really hope Rune of the Guard Captain is in the game right off the hop. Such a sick pre-raid item
---
&gt; If an MMO doesn't include that, is it still an MMO?
---
Definitely not.
---
&gt; Is Minecraft an MMO by this tenet?
---
I don't know shit about Minecraft so I couldn't say.
---
Layering is lame
---
I know that, but it also has no bearing on my post whatsoever.
---
Easy answer - Horde.
---
I played Horde up through Cata then quit until the end of Legion.
---
When I came back for BFA it was with a totally different group of people that wanted to go Alliance so I obliged. With the world going back to its original state it's time for me to go home. 
---
I've made it clear to everyone I play games with that I will be Horde, even that means we don't play Classic together.
---
&gt; "Everyone who doesnt agree with me must be some kind of evil pirate who only want easymode because I am incapable of making actual arguments"
---
The fact that they do this is just an established fact. We have now moved on to speculating about why they do this. Keep up.
---
Do you have a better idea why someone would want to play a game which they loudly proclaim is so easy that it makes even their own stereotypes of retail play look like a tough grind for hard-earned purples?
---
There are many hidden options only available through chat commands. It's always been that way.
---
Did you guys seriously not know the word antithetical until now? It's not like it's some obscure shit, it's a common as hell word. 
---
You trying to use the fact that other people have more than a monosyllabic vocab as a weapon against them just makes you look like a moron.
---
Here in New Zealand this would be considered a gang sign - the "seig fkn heil" by the Mongrel Mob
---
I played since vanilla and quit during Cataclysm, I didn’t like the changes from vanilla style talents the game got boring for me, I’ve played every expansion on launch for 2ish months except MoP just because I love a expansion launch when everything is new, I’m so excited for Classic I can’t believe it’s happening!
---
Lol? My arms are comfortably extended and not pulled in, and the arm of the chair is pretty wide, I guess you can’t see that in the picture, and with my mouse sensitivity set correctly I barely use any of the space.
---
I think you are just being hyper negative to a new idea that challenges your beliefs. I think they have a name for that.
---
Can you link your database
---
Nope, no conditionals other then combat or mods
---
That's a hard one. Added in patch 1.5 buuuut is apart of the Hinterland quest hub.  
---
So you have to debate, will they leave out the item and if so the quests? Will they allow the item to be obtained via some other method at a later time but still keep the quest? Will they remove ONLY that quest?  
---
I personally think it'll be in at launch, but I would appreciate their position if they withheld those quests.
---
Exactly it was before classic was even announced, it is ancient history.
---
Ahh, 100 dps will still not bring boomkin up to par to a mage then.
---
Wonder how much dps Faerie fire does add to the druid's personal dps if all melees in the entire raid do a bit of extra dps due to the armor reduction.
---
It's just the adjectival form of antithesis, numb nuts.
---
I don’t think I have seen a single good guide when it comes to priests or warriors. Perhaps monkeynews’ chat with tipsout or Hakurai’s vids. But I would not call those guides.
---
It’s not just the small things they get wrong. Some things they majorly screw up.
---
My first 60 was a horde priest. 
---
But I did all my vanilla raiding on alliance as a dwarf hunter.
---
Played dwarf priest in tbc.
---
Undead mage in wotlk
---
And finally troll female mage on pserver which is by far the best geared of any of them.
---
I much prefer alliance and will definitely be going home for classic.
---
I remember in vanilla watching a rogue get Shadowfang? as a drop and he equipped it. I was screaming at my computer in frustration
---
Typical alliance raid.
---
Rogue out of position in the back, not even looking at the point of interest
---
Hunter in melee range casting mend pet
---
Moonkin doesn't even have a weapon equipped and for some reason is trying to fly
---
Restro druid in the back casting wrath, raid is buffed so he has nothing else to do
---
Yeah I totally get it. Similar to the Sunken Temple quests. It was gear that was added later to help people jump into end game content more easily. I’m fine either way just would rather than sweet hit chance and AP at level 50
---
this is why i play an upright female troll
---
Ok, and now you, your friends, and Asmongold choose Illidan-b, and Illidan-b has a 12 hour queue, and you can't play WoW for the first month. Then you pull the spooky mask off of "layering", and you find out it was "servers" all along!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=318
---
I am not "fighting for layering", I tend to dislike it for the impact it could have with people who get to 60 the first week.  All I did was ask for a source for your claim.  That's it.
---
You have an odd definition of "the masses" if you think that many people are clearing top end content in retail while it's fresh.
---
Wasn’t aware that .5 was .05. In my math experience .5 is larger than .12.
---
&gt; People actually thinking 9% more Parry makes tanks drop dead instantly are the funniest.
---
Put it this way. +Hit is the most important DPS stat until you are capped. All the tanks are going to have -10% to hit compared to what they thought they would based on pirate server data.
---
&gt; Classic is also proven to have mobs do much lower damage than private servers. 
---
In some cases, yes.
---
&gt;  You didnt mention that though, because it doesnt help you paint the picture of private servers as buggy funservers.
---
You are assuming the parry bug is the one and only bug making them buggy funservers.
---
We won't know for sure until we see Classic MC. But think about it. There's a deep conflict between "on pirate servers MC is cleared in week one by thirty-five dudes in greens" and "but it's not a buggy funserver!". They *could* both be true, but is it all that likely?
---
There are some inaccuracies in this, the feral bear pre-raid bis might not have 100% perfectly itemised tanking items but it is very strong in terms of mitigation, especially compared to prot warriors. You should also be getting as much hit as possible without sacrificing much mitigation - around 5% is possible pre-raid and then you can get Ony Head Neck (which is much better than Medallion of Steadfast Might or the ony head trinket).
---
Crits and crushing blows really aren't a problem to heal through, maybe they were in vanilla when healers had terrible internet, didn't stack +heal and had to conserve mana because tank threat was shit. But when you go into your first MC with 8k HP and the armor cap, even two crits are nothing to worry about - the perfect string of crits strong enough to kill you before the healers can react requires lottery winning levels of luck with parry haste to have it happen quickly enough unless you're doing something strange like tanking rag without good fire resist or tanking magmadar without a hunter.
---
What prevents bears being a common choice for main tank is the lack of cooldowns like shield wall, the inability to stance dance fears and the 5/6 bosses in the game where warriors are better (like Nefarian because of the cat form class call, or Huhuran because of the frenzy requiring shield wall).
---
Finally, in classic one nice bonus is that you'll be able to effectively pop healthstones and potions "in form" with macros that allow for instant shifting, like in TBC.
---
Not OP but:
---
\+ Faster leveling time (it's faster to dual box 2 chars to 60 than level 1 warrior to 60)
---
\+ Free farm char ( if you tank / heal you don't need to twink / respec for 100g)
---
\+ 2 more professions
---
\+ Ability to trade / camp AH / farm / grind / camp rare mob spawns / scout world bosses during downtime
---
\- you have to skip 1 lunch at KFC every month because of 2nd subscription
---
Spending 4-5 days alone grinding mobs and doing quests you've done a 100 times already isn't lonely? Being in the endgame with 39 other guys faster :P
---
Oh come on that'd be awesome
---
If it's guarded by druids I'm not to worried
---
I always got there by jumping on that torch, wherever it was
---
It is using the latest, but modified, version (8.0) of the API. Modified so it wont have anything that Vanilla didn't have.
---
It may not be the best rogue chest piece, but I'm thinking I'm gonna try for it. One of those unfinished business things from back in the day. Looks cool, isn't bad, and I always wanted it.
---
Less than 2 euros for a 2 liter bottle of beer here in Serbia...but then again our average monthly earnings ARE 350€
---
Man those little bugs are pricks.
---
Why the hell are raids running around with Need before Greed set up and not Master loot?
---
I understand it fully, you dont seem to understand that the situation from vanilla is different compared to today.  
---
Also the word you are looking for is optimal, not viable. Viable means its possible and in vanilla i would not consider it possible in vanilla as 5 night a week with optimal classes and their specs was not enough to clear all content. There is where you get ther whole viable wording and terminology, you needed to optimise your raid if you where to clear content and therefore having a protection paladin was not considered viable as you needed to optimise.   
---
In any case good luck in classic!
---
Yeah i couldnt agree more, especially the morrowind reference. Rereading those pages and comparing rock sizes to find the path had a magic to it that gave a real sense of accomplishment.  Years ago (2008?) When i played I briefly installed questie, it did turn into autopilot.  But that was in Northrend and it was a pretty cut and dry setup and I was just trying to get to ICC.
---
I think I will print out a word doc with names of all the quests per area, marking them off as I go. I can find and complete them on my own. That way I can still know "hey I gotta go back to Ashenvale I missed something." Still feels like cheating a little but it will save me from that doubt.
---
The alternative would be doing sweeps of an area before leaving, and revisiting later even.
---
In general I agree, but Warden Staff in particular has no replacement for all of phase 1. If you're tanking endgame content as a Druid in phase 1 then this staff is well worth the \~100-200 gold that you will have to pay to get it. Unyielding Maul is the better option for those who reach 60 during phase 2 or later.
---
P.S. Unyielding Maul has +1 stamina compared to the staff. They're really, really close. I used the Maul forever on my private server Druid. But I will be buying a Warden Staff ASAP in Classic since I plan to play that at launch.
---
One of the reasons that Dots were so powerfull in TBC is that initially resillience just reduced damage from crits. Now, since dots couldn't crit, they were balanced around that. So pvp was balanced around resillience reducing the damage that other players did but resillience literally did nothing to reduce dot damage. At some point they made resillience reduce dot damage as well.
---
The most ironic comment I've read in the past week. Thank you for the good laugh.
---
Load up the game and look at the classes/races presented to you. That's enough to make this decision.
---
If you want to dig deeper than learn more about the game lore before WoW's timeline or something similar.
---
If you have friends you intend to play with then talk to them about it. If not then jump in either side. Old WoW was designed to create social interactions. You will find people to play with.
---
Screw all the min/max reasons imo.
---
That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you've only done one of those two things. Wait till Lady Blameaux gets loose in your raid a couple times and then come back and tell us how Naxx has no mechanics, please.
---
Actually we are both wrong. Burr (druid) lost to Payo(rogue), but another Hunter did beat a warrior
---
&gt; I'm sorry my use of "quotes" offends you, but honestly I think people like you are blowing it way out of proportion and it seems to be reactionary to what streamers are showing off on beta or to the odd "look at all this nobody" screenshots that get posted.
---
I'm not offended, I'm just tired of myopic people like you trying to weasel their way out of having to answer for the negatives of the system you're endorsing.
---
&gt; seems to be reactionary to what streamers are showing off on beta or to the odd "look at all this nobody" screenshots that get posted.
---
I don't watch that shit, so, wrong.
---
&gt; the fact is individual layers are going to be loaded and you are not going to notice that there are in fact 4 layers for your server
---
I can, and I will.  Period.  I already know layering will be present. 
---
 That doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.  'Nuff said.  Muted.
---
"Dynamic" doesn't mean "more, always"
---
I'm a fan of using gnomish shrink ray on molten giants in MC just to freak people out. Honestly, that's enough for me.
---
... Thanks, I now have the perfect non-starter response to the anti-layering league.
---
I also intend to run Backstab Seal Fate, but with a heavier focus on PvE. Thus relentless strikes and ruthlessness are basically a must-have. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhefoxdVZGcV0bzZV is the current plan.
---
Sometimes fails, but yes. Was druid engineer. Was useful.
---
How to spot an idiot in 1 simple step 😂
---
I don't think I ever got shadowfang back in the day, but I was certainly ignorant enough to equip it if I *had* gotten that lucky.
---
Unfortunately, everyone I know that’s going to play Classic is going Alliance. Guess I’m going to be a human?
---
It still equates to 3 hit. Just like on private servers. 305 weapon skill is actually more value on Classic than private. You cant even read and understand the source you posted if you think its only 2 hit.
---
It ain't retail bro. It's classic. You're not gonna get ousted from a group simply over layering switching time.
---
Love it! I remember reading any available lore for the dungeons I would run as I waited for a group.
---
From what I have heard you don't switch back to your layer, and you can be placed in a different layer every time you log on.  There's quite a bit video of unprompted layer switching too.
---
I would leave that to the tech. guys, but in this system you would choose your layer at character creation.
---
Well definitely check out Minorou's companion! It's linked in the description :)
---
Thanks a lot for watching!
---
Yeah for sure, I was talking about queues in general, not just high pop queues.
---
I mostly left in late WotLK. The game changed a lot from TBC, the game got really easy, and also I had regular work and a girlfriend and hardcore WoW pretty much requires you to lack one or the other. I jest - somewhat.
---
I left for good in Cata before hitting the level cap. It's not so much that it was *bad*, I think, as that it was a new game. My paladin had a whole new set of spells and a whole new rotation and it didn't feel like my toon any more, so I no longer had any attachment to it. Suddenly there were no sunk costs, there were other games I could play, and WoW didn't hold my attention.
---
I thought about resubbing for pandas, but I just didn't get around to it.
---
Isn't that the whole fucking point? To play WoW as it used to be before 15 years of(mostly poor) changes?
---
Paladins can be slow but relentless. They might not kill fast, but they can take the hits and keep healing.
---
They may not be the best for leveling fast, but they're really good at getting things done solo--it'll just take longer.
---
I would be astonished if you were even 25% of the way towards your epic mount by the time you hit 60.
---
I'm rolling a healer just to deal with other players' bullshit. The better healer you are, the more the tank pulls. This continues until the first wipe at which time "bad heals" is thrown out into chat. It's at this point that I begin to become awakened. Then during tough pulls, the group will only wait 4 seconds for mana regen. At this point, I become aroused. It isn't until 6 wipes on the final boss of a level 29 instance that things get...ideal. And to finish it all off, I climax to the shitty tank rolling need on a cloth helm that thinks is good because someone said spirit is good for leveling warriors. God I miss it. The real struggle of Vanilla WoW is the cooperation and I hope it doesn't get any easier this time around.
---
Totally awesome, well done. Subscribed! Can't wait for more.
---
There's no reading of your comment that makes it not dumb. None. LFR gets one-shotted by pugs coms-free the minute it opens. On the other hand, go watch a stream of a middle-of-the-road private server raid guild made up of people who are new to Naxx but experienced with live raiding (that means not Apes, but people who are genuinely learning this stuff for the first time) work their way through the content. Really, I encourage you to do this; such streams are easily found on Twitch if you scroll down into the nobodies, any night of the week. Guess what? It's a learning process for such players. They sit there wiping on Instructor Razuvious.
---
As a avid player who barely left Azeroth during Vanilla except to get some sleep, it is hard for me to express how excited I am for Classic.
---
I got my hands on a beta account, and have been playing it, but I am a bit worried that Blizzard might be right in some respects. The reason being is that the beta is DEAD right now. Three people in IronForge (2 dueling outside and one AFKer) and NOONE in Stormwind last weekend when I logged in to run to Westfall for my Druid form quest. I'm lvl 17 now and lost interest as soon as I found out that there is barely anyone playing the game unless there is a specific streamer event.
---
I would have thought everyone with a beta key would be playing the socks off the game. I played during the open stress test too and the servers got shut down early because there weren't enough people on to stress it. :|
---
I'm hoping launch day will be massively different....
---
Yeah, I see your point too. I hadn't really thought about lower pop servers because I only played on 2 high pop servers.
---
I imagine he’s taking a summer break before things heat up in August (pun not intended)
---
You can try asking on his discord: https://discord.gg/vFxpS4H
---
Agree I think Frost is a great content creator :)
---
What happens if the layer you chose full?  Just have to wait the queue out?
---
I can't ditch this feeling of resentment given I was always low on money, but yeah, I did get good use out of it during leveling. AOE grenade stuns for pack pulls or self-healing were really nice. Another thread just now reminded me how often I used jumper cables as a druid when I didn't/couldn't use battle res (doubly nice for rogues/hunters who can res the healer after a party wipe). Gnomish Death Ray is more of a novelty at 60, but if you build that while leveling, holy shit it packs a punch. 
---
I'm really tempted to do the min max thing and go alchemy this time. However, I have to say honestly that engi -- as much of a pain as it was -- was pretty cool. And if I found myself making an alt with money to spare, it'd be that much better.
---
Pallies are great at soloing difficult stuff (e.g. instances). It does take a while but I remember e.g. soloing large chunks of dire maul.
---
I always liked prot/holy (ideally 20/31, but I think holy/reck would work, or maybe even 31/20) for sort of aoe grinding on the paladin.
---
Imo when it comes to the undead vs troll thing I feel you should pick what feels best to you. They both have different playstyles due to the extra racials. You can’t go wrong picking undead for priest over troll or vice versa since it’s not like we have dwarfs.
---
Personally the reason I went troll is because I’m weird and like the troll female model lol.
---
* Warden is only BIS for tanking if you are not armor capped. Otherwise, the R14 weapon is BIS
---
* MCP + Blessed Qiraji War Hammer are BIS for anything requiring threat.
---
I am actually thinking of going kind of a meme spec. 17/0/34
---
Mostly for fun. typical Hemo build but deep into Sub right down to premeditation. Obviously the lack of Cold Blood is a real kick in the teeth but I will be almost exclusively playing with another Rogue that will be burst damage/dagger build. I might end up being a chickenshit in the end and just do 21/3/27 but I just love almost everything in the sub tree. This is for PvP of course.
---
Easier if you want to pug with randoms that don't have a clue, with a guild group BRD escort is a cinch and that's the major difference, Horde get a dragon hunting chore where they need to travel across the world.
---
They're not really arbitrary tribal lines in this case. Based on the language of your post I'm gonna assume you're pretty smart, and if you wanted to, you could come to some conclusion about exactly why this bias exists. So I'm not accused of arguing in bad faith or trolling, let me help: 
---
* Retail is generally considered to be in a _very_ bad place. Not just by pserver players. There is no pretending WoW is doing well. 
---
* The design direction of modern WoW is both a response to market trends (thanks, Activision) and an effort to lower the barrier to entry for new players, despite WoW having always been the MMO your grandma can play. 
---
Put yourself in the shoes of a classic player, *really* consider those two bullet points, and imagine what they say about the retail playerbase from the perspective of someone who left long ago due to those design decisions.
---
I'd say those few hours matter the most. Getting ahead of the zerg means the rest of the leveling is even faster.
---
Not months - weeks.  
---
Ultimately, it is subjective.  Did you play in vanilla?
---
It really is this simple, I don't know how it can seem so difficult other than "We don't want to invest a lot of money and investors are yelling at us".
---
I see you wanna rend bosses too lol
---
Yes it is. Simply because 1.12 makes it possible if you have around 30-35 players that rush to 60.
---
Anything below patch 1.8 I'd say no way MC is being cleared in the first two IDs. Because that was a time when Hunters had the worst 31 point talent in the history of the game. Alongside other useless things.
---
&gt; a third of their epic mount
---
If you can buy Warden Staff for 300g then that is a steal and you should snag it up. It will be closer to your epic mount and that of your alt than a third of one.
---
Anyone knows stuff about healbot (the modern one)/vuhdo yet?  
---
Or any other "click on frame 2 heal" addon? I always used one when i healed and it will basically come down to if i can use one of those if i play heal or dps
---
Another reason a loot trade system isn’t needed. If it’s raid only, why isn’t it just ML? It makes no sense. People downvoting me just because they want to do exactly what I’m saying is wrong.
---
Ok, so, this thing needs alot of work. I'm just going to bullet off some problems with it that I think should be addressed.
---
- When I went to create a guild I got a message back that there was an internal server error. I came back to this thread and saw somebody else saying the same thing. After I created a character the issue was resolved, but it was certainly a little clunky. I don't think there is really a need to force somebody to attach a character profile as the guild leader. 
---
- Naming the guild was a little awkward. I didn't know if the program would automatically put the &lt;&gt; on either side. I ended up naming it with the &lt;&gt; myself and then had to go back and delete them because the website added them when I was finished. I don't think the game actually allows special characters to be in a guild name, maybe they should be disabled entirely.
---
- The character creation is very minimal and only has one box for  typing about your character progress. We need alot more entries so people can really express who they are and what they are looking for. Nobody is going to want to recruit some generic X class and Y spec. We wana know who people are, what their goals are, what times they can play, ect ect.
---
- When viewing a guild bio the delineation at the top just says [PvE]. It doesn't make it clear that the guild is on a PvP server, but is mainly a PvE focused guild.
---
- When looking for potential recruits there doesn't seem to be a way of contacting them outside of hitting the recruit button, but I don't want to recruit them yet, I just want to talk to them. I don't even want to hit the button because I don't want to accidentally invite somebody that we haven't vetted yet. 
---
- There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the way characters are listed when searching for potential recruits. It appears to just be listing them in order of creation because my profile is near the bottom (I guess?). We need ways to sort the list and legit search functions. If this website were to get a few thousand users it would become very hard to search for anyone.
---
- I have no way of adding people to my roster who do not have a profile on the website. I don't want to ask everyone to go create profiles on the website and then have to hound them for days to do it because we need to have an accurate roster. We should be able to, as the GM, manually add entries to our roster. 
---
- When I saved my guild bio it converted all of the nice formatting I did into walls of text. Let us format our text as we see fit.
---
- Expanding the boxes on the page to type in had some... interesting effects on the web page.
---
- On a personal note, I really dislike the art style of the site. I see where you are going with the /who box and everything, but I just don't like it. Good artistic style on these sites is something that enhances the page aesthetically while not interfering with the functionality. The theme feels too intrusive to me and the colors start to bother my eyes after reading things for a while on there. 
---
That's all I really have for now, there might be more but those were just my immediate thoughts. 
---
I think you're on to something good here, but it needs alot more work before it's going to be something really serviceable.
---
Yep.  That's what it comes down to.  On private servers I'd just remote desktop in from work and log on about 45 minutes before I left work.
---
That’s not the case in live? I swear I remember seeing a blue post that your name is saved to your account for like 60 days past character deletion. Since you can now restore characters that have been deleted with click of a button it seems like you can easily circumvent the character name change fee if they don’t hold your name.
---
Bears do tremendous threat I have found
---
&gt; I don't know what the classic value was, but let's say it was 2500 players on a server. If the layers maintain this maximum population per layer, then you will still be getting the "classic experience" with the same server population available to you.
---
No, it won't, precisely _because_ the server population is higher than 2500 and is thus variable in its distribution throughout the different layers.  Even though we're both on the same server, someone I played with yesterday might be, for whatever reason, locked to a different layer (perhaps due to a layer cooldown or something of the like)-- and would thus be completely invisible and inaccessible to me.  Even if they weren't locked to their layer, I would not encounter that player organically in the game world like I _should_ be able to in an MMO.
---
There's no difference between that and separate servers...  Are you thinking?
---
Yeah, playing with your friends is far and away the most important.
---
Go for it! I think it will be great, actually. You will have lots of new content to do, instead of just going through the same-old-same-old. I wish I had only played one faction back in the day so that I could do that now.
---
I think warrior just because a lot of abilities have a stance requirement so you can have those abilities share keybinds easily.
---
Depends how you define best I guess. I'd probably try melee cleave dungeon grinding if I was in a position to do so, sounds like fun. 4 warriors, 1 shaman.  I think mage stacking is probably technically the fastest and 'best', but doesn't sound like as much fun to me.  
---
For a balanced group that makes use of gear and is flexible and fun I'd probably go Hunter/Mage/Warlock/Pally Healer/War tank. 3 Ranged dps make for very easy runs in vanilla because a huge number of 'mechanics' are just *melee take more damage*. Pallies make awesome healers with great group buffs and should make great use of all gear that drops.
---
If you hadn't finished it, bulwark would never drop.
---
Mage, Warlock and Warrior are the three staples that need to be in there no matter what. Mage for ports and food, Lock for summons and other utility, and warrior to tank. (Could be druid as well, though warriors work better).
---
After that you need a healer. Priest is the best while leveling and the best dungeon healer. Shaman or Pally would be fine as well. Those also provide more buffs.
---
After that its a wild card for the last spot. Melee dps might be nice to have. Hybrid melee dps like ret and enhance is actually pretty good while leveling, its only completely awful at 60.  A rogue does insane damage while leveling and end game, and also could pick locks and lockboxes for you.
---
This sub is so toxic Im considering unfollowing it to keep my love for wow intact.
---
How about a BoE gut rippper dropping with your buddies. But the hunter takes it and equips it because he liked how it looked...
---
I’ve been a loyal member of the Alliance since classic, but I’ll be going Horde this time around. 
---
My friends going Horde took the decision making power away from me, but now I can’t stop thinking about the Shaman I’m gonna roll. It’s my favorite old game... but brand new quests and even some zones. Brand new cities. 
---
As you said, it’s a chance to go down a new timeline! I’m super excited for the opportunity.
---
A cat druid needs to bring like, 20 MCPs to raid lol. A bear can get by with 3 or so.
---
Surprised yall are even old enough to remember classic
---
hell yeah, commit to your bad idea because a stranger on the internet said it was dumb! Prove me so fucking wrong you never care about how uncomfortable you are! every time you have to scratch your balls and move your keyboard and get annoyed nothing will just stay put or your mouse falls off your chair as you go to type to someone, you'll remember how you proved that one random fucking dude wrong on reddit.
---
and don't even get me STARTED on how crazy girls are going to go for this idea, we'll be here all night man
---
Let people who are ONLY interested in playing Classic play on specific servers and let the retail tourists play on another. 
---
I'd take a server merge over layering any day.
---
I posted basically this in my guilds Discord, and had 1 member argue me to the death that they didn't want Classic to lead to Retail. He still believes that 4 chan "leak" is real, and that they are going to give which ever group (20 vs 200 lul) control of Retail based on numbers Classic vs Retail get.
---
On top of that, he 100% believes that Classic at some point will have a shop and tokens etc.
---
&gt;a bunch of my friends
---
There are 3 guilds recruiting for RP-PvP in the whole world right now. That's less than 1% of all guilds recruiting. Obvioulsy there are people that want to play on these servers but it's a tiny minority and doubtful that it would be enough players to fill even one server in each region. I mean in all of NA is one guild recruiting...
---
Should have rolled harder.
---
Don't hate on Gnomes damn it. I mean I'm going Dwarf warr instead of Gnome, but don't hate on Gnomes damn it.
---
&gt; Yes it is. Simply because 1.12 makes it possible if you have around 30-35 players that rush to 60.
---
I've been looking in a half-arsed kind of way for evidence anyone ever did this in real 1.12, as opposed to pirate server 1.12, and haven't found any. Got a link?
---
How do you expect to get evidence?
---
Which class is Shadowfang best for?
---
Well, people are expecting that after 20 years of milking the same cow, blizzard would go out of their way and invest some resources to bring back the original game. I mean it’s so easy these days to scale in and out resources of a server to the point that I don’t see the need for layers.
---
The armor. Because dire bear form increases armor by 360%, warden staff is worth 1104 armor
---
Jesus you're such a sensitive little prick
---
On private servers it varies from 10-30g depending on how many have the recipes and how good you are at controlling the market. The recipes themselves go for about 500-1500g so you have to craft a lot of flasks to make your investment back. Typically you will build up some capital in terms of flasks and trade them for mats + fee. Then when you have your bags full of mats you run a scholo or preferably a BWL. The alchemy lab is two trash pulls after Lashlayer so it should be quite easy to access. 
---
On Nost I banded together with some other alchemists and tried to drive up the profits but it's quite hard in an environment that is very overpopulated and has people online 24/7. I can imagine it being easier on Classic.
---
The difference is with a large server and layering you will see the same people because this will still be the same server. I know this because I have in the beta currently(well weeks ago while people were still playing) and even when they had the more extreme sharding model that I would agree would break continuity when changing zones. This is the complaint that was addressed through layering. In layering you are going to have the ability to handle the tourist population and streamer stan population, and the server bloat they will bring while limiting queues and server cap issues. At the same time maintain a healthy population after the tourists and streamers move on to the next thing, this is where small server will fail and the idea of server mergers is more community breaking than anything else.
---
Screw that, my new life goal is to have TF on my rogue.  I want my damned bindings!!!
---
And they'd have been the best in the world if their leader wasn't toxic.
---
MoP - Dailies
---
\&gt; In Vanilla no one knew how to use it or that it existed, but today everyone understands how to use LFG it would be a pretty big difference between Vanilla and Classic.
---
No no one used it because it was useless. And it still will be. It doesn’t bother with group makeup. So you Could just end up with 5 dps and no healers.
---
I tried to email the guy behind war-tools but I didn't get an answer :(
---
Shots fucking fired.
---
Sharding doesn't look/feel Vanilla and neither does layering. There is no difference. 
---
I see no upside.
---
The vast majority of players on a server won’t use a discord to find groups, good ol trade or world channels
---
This is the part where everybody realizes the people who are pro-layering are 1 of 3 things:
---
1. A troll 
---
2. Stupid
---
3. Trying to ruin classic because they’re upset with the fact that they spent so much IRL money on their retail WoW characters that nobody will care about after Classic releases, especially if it’s nearly as successful as OSRS.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
No one said MC is hard. I am just arguing that engineering should be expected for min maxers. Sulfuron has 5 targets so if you stack them up and have multiple people using sapper charges the boss will die much faster.
---
Blood and Thunder...
---
Then go play retail WoW.
---
I know of 3 where a taunt is required for the most common strategies. One of them you can outshadowresistance and the other two can be done with a fury warrior taunting, they dont hit especially hard compared to other bosses.   
---
I'm not saying its easy, great, good or optimal, I'm just saying its fully doable and fully viable and the only reason for them not being "viable" is becuause that is exactly how they where in vanilla, not viable at all, as just progressing through the lower contents needed a optimal group, having a paladin tank then would really not have been viable if you wanted to keep your guild together.
---
roll a warlock
---
just don't use it on ragnaros...
---
Elementals, with imp dampen magic talent you can easily aoe farm essence of air in silithus, also easily kill earth/fire/water eles in their various spawns
---
NEVER !! can walk by gnomes !! either are weebs or banned around schools !
---
You lose the teleporter to tanaris, that specifically requires Gnomish engineering.
---
Brings back some good memories. My first epic BoE world drop was the Skullflame Shield which was extremely lucky considering it dropped for my Prot Paladin that I made that AOE farming.
---
I would have argued you on that until I heard about Classic. I quit in 2010 and had no desire to ever come back. But, I guess I was just taking a long break.
---
Mighty high calling a group of people “clowns” when you spend time making Reddit posts to /r/FortniteBR and /r/marchagainsttrump
---
Go back to the Reddit sea where you belong LMFAO
---
It isn’t math, it is version numbers. A version number is made up of a major version number (before the decimal) and a minor version number (after the decimal). And sometimes a 3rd after a 2nd decimal that is referred to a revision number.  They are each a separate number referring to something different.
---
From your post it seems you wanna go rogue. So go rogue and be the best you can be!
---
If there is no evidence then how can it "be" a certain way? It's a stupid response to a stupid arguement
---
I think he is trying really hard to troll.
---
My power group is Prot Warrior, Fury Warrior, Resto Shaman, Fire Mage, and Marksmenship Hunter. For our five man goon squad for dungeon grinding.
---
This is just my opinion - there will be a shortage of certain DPS classes because players understand the importance of healing and tanking more now than they did in Vanilla. I say go Rogue
---
This torch is one of my motivations for playing Classic
---
You're thinking of WotLK. Destru wasn't really played much in TBC. It was slightly viable while people were still running warrior sham pally  stuff in 5v5, but once Druid/Priest/Rogue/Warlock/Mage took over you couldn't really compete at the top with destru.
---
If you don't like layering then go play something else :)
---
See how that makes you sound like a fucking idiot?
---
I wouldnt call it RP. Its more like associating bad experiences.
---
For example, if you've only ever leveled as horde, seeing a gnome rogue may trigger a little ptsd reaction in your head. 
---
I hate those little fuckers so much
---
Hmm, the 3-day trial I received on one of my accounts expires today. &gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah bro fuck yeah I love Reddit too brother FUCK YEAH
---
Most of us do not like to spend 2h in molten core when we can spend less than 1 by being effective.
---
&gt; expected phase 2 population
---
Nobody knows the expected phase 2 population
---
No changes means original population limit or bust.
---
I dont value our game so here is some free stuff
---
I been raiding vanilla/classic wow for years.
---
Prot pallies are not viable.  They can't tank in a raid.
---
stopped at TBC. Horde paladin, alliance shaman.. lmao, no thanks. I had already played vanilla for way to long and it was just time to move on.
---
Just have two level 60 warriors.
---
I ran mining/herb just fine on an alt. All you need to do is make a macro so each click switches between tracking the two.
---
#showtooltip
---
/castsequence Find Herbs, Find Minerals
---
Is it a little extra "work"? Yeah sure some people might find that too much, but after awhile you know generally where a mining node will spawn anyway so you can spend most of your time tracking herbs anyway.
---
 The cool thing about classic is to some people it’s more fun running UBRS and 5 mans, personally I don’t even care about Naxx- as most of the player base probably won’t step foot inside
---
No OP made a distinction and used solid reasoning to back it up, their cannot be “evidence” to that.
---
&gt;you really have not
---
Could you clarify that first part? Not sure what you were referring to. I would rather have queues and dynamic respawns than layering.
---
"Because obviously" is such a great reasoning
---
the r/iamverybadass of wow
---
Came here to say this, I’m in a similar boat. So I’m just looking on the bright side, Alliance Vanilla will be like a whole new game to me (sort of).
---
You consider standing on top of players bannable?
---
Sheesh, need to seriously rethink my strategies for classic &gt;&lt;
---
*2006 world champion standing on top of gnomes*
---
Not this game.
---
Explain what would suffice as evidence then.
---
Blade of eternal darkness. I only remember because I needed it as a hunter because I figured it would proc off of arcane shot. I don’t remember if it did or not. Sorry mage that rage kicked me lol
---
They did a ton of them, just not early on. They even had free migrations off of "dead" realms after a certain point lol
---
Yeah, it's way more immersive to sit in a 14 hour queue and not see anyone anyway!
---
No because layering is an option in the retail game.
---
Layering was not an option in the Classic game.
---
Therefore I want my vanilla ice cream and you can have your chocolate.
---
I wouldn’t expect someone who spends as much time as you do on Reddit to understand basic logic like that but you can do it buddy I believe in you.
---
I wonder if being on a different layer will affect instanced zones.. like it your standing outside the portal and don't see your party cause they're on a different layer but then when you all run in your in the same instance.
---
You don't need to track mining. You see rich thorium veins from miles.
---
https://vanillawowdb.com
---
Imagine if the pservers you wanted to play on had 4-5 hour queues every time you tried to log on, doesn't sound that great anymore does it?
---
Is that a controller?
---
F
---
Because everyone will be put onto their own layer by themselves and not a layer of 3 thousand people like a normal vanilla server right?
---
So you can take both? I thought they would have you choose one the other.
---
Will boomerkins be wanted in raids?
---
Lightbringer is a \[Redacted\] that \[Redacted\] \[Redacted\] in 2017.
---
It is known.
---
One would assume private server.
---
I don't think there was any specs that got straight up worse, but relatively I'm fairly sure Frost Mage was much less of a thing in TBC (as fire was already taking over, and frost didn't see any major improvements).
---
Looking through the other specs I'm thinking Arms Warrior might've been less relevant as well, might be completely wrong about that though. And I don't really know the Rogue specs too well, but I think they also got more focused around one superior spec.
---
they clearly werent
---
I believe it was a damage issue. Especially when warlocks could mop the floor, as well as provide great raid utility in a 25 man raid setting, where raid utility was more sought after.
---
I was confused because Lightbringer was my servers for Vanilla
---
You surprise easily
---
Well I played horde in vanilla so I never once saw what I know was a protection paladin
---
They would be hardpressed for sure and some magic would have to happen for a paladin to stick around as a maintank or the guild keeping together if things start turning dark and vanilla like wipe nights appear, and I surely would agree they cant be considered a viable maintank, but you seem to argue that a paladin could not even pick up a offtanking tanking spot because its not optimal and therefore impossible even when the content itself is not really that hard. 
---
Or do you perhaps need the absolutely most optimised raid group down to the offtank to clear all content? Nope you do not, meaning then they can tank but not as well as warriors.
---
I've played enough private servers alliance side to know that they function fine even in a raid settin, and even if its much worse this time around compared to private servers because of fault incoming dmg from bosses or something not they would most likely still be able to clear content just fine unless its a major discrepancy. I find it amusing you are arguing that its impossible because "i raided in vanilla" when I've clearly explained the terminology used back then and how it relates to know. The meaning of the word has not changed a bit and it was not used wrongly back then either, its just that the situation has changed and things that would not work at all back then can be included, especially in minor positions like third tank, in everything from casuals to hardcore guilds. If they are going for world first or server first no a paladin would not be a viable choice unless some new strategy is deviced but if you are only going to clear content with a fun team in a timely manner that guild really have to suck not being able to fit everything from 1-5 hybrids and still clear content. 
---
Ergo prot paladins are viable :)
---
Or possibly a typo. That's why I asked.
---
Awh ain't you adorable. It's northing compared to normal wow or legion servers.
---
Ah okay I'd be okay with 6000 on a busy server if they up the cap when they merge them.  I don't think I'd go above 10k though personally if it's more than three full layers.
---
Kiki do you love me?
---
Nope. Whenever you can be a troll you be a troll.
---
Yeah, mages hit a weird spot in BC. They still had a good role in PVP, but they werent the cannons they were in Vanilla.
---
Uhh if your raid group clears bwl you can get there easy. Dont even need a rogue.
---
Where’s the “translate” button
---
Hahaha yeah, friend of mine got so bored of Druid healing in TBC (spam lifebloom) he raged quit
---
The lk PvP is the best on wow ever. That's it
---
Not at all.  I've done most of these quests already to the point where I pretty much memorized all of them up to level ~35 on horde side.  A quest helper just gives me the convenience of not having to constantly open the quest journal to see which ones I have or am missing.  I can just open the map and plan my route.
---
Maybe.  A lot of players have been doing the 60 grind in private servers and are prepared for that though.
---
Honestly spending 10 days played getting to 60 could arguably cause more burnout than efficiently getting there in 4 days. 
---
But if you mean more like getting it done in 2 real weeks spending say 120hours in that time to be 60 within 2 weeks that could cause players to burnout.  But I think those actually comitting to that playstyle will weather it fine.  It's a different type of player that not only wants to pull that off but actually does it.
---
Don't underestimate the wow nolifers!  (No flame, I was a vanilla nolifer, just not this time around)
---
How do you handle switching between hawk, monkey, cheetah, and pack. Do you have four separate binds or are there macros that clean it up?
---
Yep. Account created in January 05 IIRC so a short while after launch, although played earlier through my cousins account. I just didn't have a good enough computer day one. 
---
Also, the months comment was from your own words, so I don't see why you corrected that. 
---
&gt; expectation of a merger in the first month or two.
---
&gt; first month or two.
---
I suppose I could have written it as Month(s), but yeah.

---
Most if this "memes" are shitty things.
---
Dude how old are you, 12? lol
---
&gt;  I had a troll mage at 60 literally naked on a pserver to farm herbs.
---
Why would you ever do that with a mage rather than just AoE farming mobs?  Talk about inefficient.
---
Opinions are like assholes, everyone’s got one. It’s fine. Definitely don’t have back problems or pain. It’s just a super comfortable set up for extended gaming. Thought I would share.
---
I remember this, having been a mage in TBC.  People would invite mages so they could drop a table and then kick them for their warlocks.  "Jaw-dropping damage" and all that.  Most people have forgotten those days since mages became incredibly powerful in Wrath and have remained that way ever since.
---
I'm all for Spell Batching. That's the original experience.
---
I don't think that's true anymore. I've been ridiculed endlessly both on this sub and in the Beta/Stress Test for not having Discord.
---
It seems like it's the "norm" these days.
---
Same boat! I started in Cata, played Horde and tried some classes for a little bit of time until sticking with Hunter. Leveled all the way up to 78 (level cap 85)...
---
Then I really started enjoying BG's and PvP in general, so I went Alliance/Human for their crazy good Racial trinket and stuck with Alliance ever since.
---
Looks wise, I can't stand Gnomes and Dwarves, and NE's look super awkward to me.
---
So I just created nothing but Humans for the racial and because they're the most 'normal' looking.
---
Now though, in Classic, where racials are a bit more balanced, I think I'm going Horde for the looks. Thinking Undead/Orc Rogue, though I might just make a Gnome Mage with a friend for shits and giggles.
---
I'm pretty sure it's all put together in a single roll, so you can't both parry and block the same attack.
---
On Reddit, yes, be a troll always. In World of Warcraft!”? No.
---
Bro I feel you, I wanna play a shaman so bad. Never played a horde char. ever,  and I started a month before BC was released.
---
Seeing as how the go-to raiding spec has you sacrifice your demon, that is almost useless after leveling.
---
You see no offense but human just seems the most boring to me! I feel like, look at all these crazy races I can be why would I pick boring old human! But I can totally see where you are coming from.
---
Oh but also to the OP... Horde has the biggest shoulder models, and our weapons are bigger this is the most important!
---
there isnt one vanilla spec id play over the tbc version
---
It's not about the server stability, or the price of the servers. It's about the fact that the actual world of Azeroth was not designed to be able to handle 10k people packed together in the 1-30 zones. Imagine 1,000 people in Westfall - you'd play for 3 hours and kill 6 gnolls.
---
As a mage, felwood is a great spot. Demonic runes are helpful and felcloth will sell easily
---
&gt; 14 hour queue 
---
Lol, if we’re being ridiculous why not make it a 35 hour queue or a 15 day queue
---
Leveling an alt just to farm is pretty stupid.  That's anywhere from 7-10 days /played just to farm gold.  Take those 168-240 hours and just gear out your healer and farm with that.  You'll be fine.
---
So I got little knowledge on this, why can he run over the trap without it popping?
---
If it was all at the same time with no order or priorities then you *could* do both at the same time.
---
[El's Anglin' Reborn](https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/)
---
I should have added chests to the interactions list. Nodes/chests both should trigger the cool down. 
---
I see what you mean though, if you show up and miss the chest, you still get one extra chance at swapping layers. It's not perfect but the cooldown should help a lot.
---
I thought vanilla was good, so did a lot of other people.  Spell batching was in vanilla.  Spellbatching isn't in retail on the same scale, I don't think retail is good. So, if you don't think spell batching is good, then your taste is probably more in line with retail's playstyle.  That's all I'm saying.
---
It really is, the people with the power to make this happen are the ones who are investing and ultimately have the most power... No ones this stupid.
---
The warlock class became immensely powerful in *World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade*. Hunters specializing in Beast Mastery also saw improvements. Protection Paladins had a taunting ability bestowed upon their persons. Druids remained largely unaltered except for the Restoration specialization which was indeed bolstered. Mages found themselves on the receiving end of several bodily discharges.
---
Thusly may this topic of contention be summed up.
---
&gt; I feel that since I will be probably looking them up again anyway so I don't miss anything, is it really such a bad idea to get questie or something so I don't have to tab out?
---
A significant portion of the game is exploration and discovery. Looking up a quest guide is the same as looking up the solution to a maze or a puzzle. If you are already going to ruin your experience by "looking up the answers" then an addon that gives you all the answers is not any worse.
---
Not a thing in vanilla. They wanted switching crafting specs to hurt. You could drop engineering completely then learn it again with a different specialization. Before 1.10, you couldn't even do that.
---
Then in TBC they changed it so that you could change specs without releveling engineering.
---
Seems fair. Destro was practically top tier in PVE, so it's good game balance to let them be a little weak in PVP. Didn't BC open some new doors for Warlocks though? With some of the more sought after talents being out of reach in Vanilla, the extra 10 points gave birth to some wicked combinations, right?
---
or /cast [@cursor] "AoE" 
---
for non-targeting spells
---
One or the other.
---
BUT, if you unlearn Engineering and relearn it, then you can take the other specialization and get the best of both worlds, so to speak.  Very few items, like the teleporters, are Gnomish/Goblin only, everything else that is BoP only requires Engineering itself and anything that isn't can just be traded for.
---
SL/SL was meta through entire tbc
---
I mained a prot warrior at the start of BC, so I'm not too familiar with the DPS side of things. But it certainly *seemed* as though warriors were just average DPS, instead of the powerhouses they were in Vanilla.
---
Did Prot Warrior get worse, or did Bear Druid became more viable.
---
That's maybe true for socially unacceptable behaviours but that's not what we're talking about here. 
---
For people who are not doing what they are supposed to there could be a multitude of reasons. Like for example that they don't know what they are supposed to be doing, that they feel like they know a better way, or that they are unmotivated. A good leader talks with the person in private, finds out what the issue is and then addresses it. Public shaming will be totally counterproductive in almost all cases and will just lead to resentment.
---
If you want, turning off the arrow but leaving the rest wouldn't break immersion much. Consider the marks on your map as directions given by the quest NPC.
---
There is a difference between some people dropping off, and 80% of your population leaving the game
---
I guess I should have phrased it differently. I don't want to look up guides the tell me go to a b c.  I meant after I go through a place on my own and sweep it I don't want to miss anything so I'll probably do a double check.
---
Boomkin is better than ele sham. Why is everyone all over ele sham but hates on boom?
---
Well then you must be a boomer that doesn't understand memes
---
Ask and ye shall receive, haha.
---
On our side we have me as a hunter, then a warlock, a rogue and a mage, so we'll have to split in different groups, unless our mage goes priest to heal and we find a tank! I'm glad we have "too many" friends involved, in our case, we'll have to do more than one group
---
Shot answer, no. Long answer, some specs suffered because everyone else got more and shinier new toys than they did.
---
For example I was very disappointed as a priest in Holy spec. We only got one new PvE healing tool that was used outside niche situations, and it got nerfed out of existence shortly after launch because it turned out to be a bit too good in arena. So basically you were playing the same toon you played in vanilla, while everyone else had amazing new toys like invisibility or exploding doom seeds. Prot warriors in early Tier 4 kind of sucked compared to bears and tankadins, and mages and rogues struggled to do decent DPS compared to the flavours of the month.
---
I believe things got wonky by the end of Tier 6 as well, with mainstays like shadow priests and tankadins getting benched in Sunwell because they just didn't scale properly at that level.
---
It wasn't quite a communist utopia of universal viability, but it was much better balanced than vanilla.
---
That's a pretty slow leveling expectation for hunter. I'm definitely planning on spending more than an average of 2h a day leveling, and I see myself as around the bottom of people concerned with BiS.
---
Regardless you can easily have 2x dawns edge within 2 hours of dinging 60. Lok'delar being an upgrade requires you to have gotten literally 0 weapon upgrades in all of phase 1 raiding and the runs preceding the leaf drop that goes to you.
---
I'm not saying no one will use it, but it just isn't at all competition with Rend set especially in the content of pre-raid BiS as in the OP.
---
Really though, it sounds like you wanna kick ass and take names. The pros you listed under Priest might as well have been "Play the game for other people".
---
I think the cons under Rogue might as well be followed by "Challenge Accepted".
---
they still were the only tank who could actually tank illidan though, so they still got that favoritism. He had a mechanic that flat out instant killed non-prot tanks lol
---
Oh yup. I get it now.
---
Started horde, switched to alliance mid legion when my guild disbanded. Work schedule at the time made it hard to find another guild that raided at a time that I was available so I switched to alliance for a change of pace. Kind of regret doing it now, If for whatever reason something happens to the guild I'm in now or we can't raid anymore I'll probably switch back.
---
Ehh it's a little bit more than 5-10 seconds. It gets worse as you get better gear and more int.
---
A) That's toxic as fuck.
---
B) I can read it. It's far worse than on pservers. 
---
The actual Classic values show that weapon skill reduces chance to be dodge and parried by 0.04% per point instead of 0.4% per point. That allows dodge/parry to be pushed off the combat table in Pservers, especially since the Parry chance on Pservers is between 5-6.5% and not 14% like it's supposed to be.
---
&gt;Which means with +5 weapon skill bonus you only have 6% chance to miss mobs 3 levels higher than you, instead of 8% with no weapon skill bonus.
---
I assume you're saying it's 3% because of the hidden 1% chance to miss for boss level mobs that exists if you have under 305 weapon skill. So that's only 3% to hit if you're under 8%. That's not exactly 3%, because it stops providing a bonus after 8% hit. 
---
All the values converge pointing to 2%.
---
Weapon skill is dramatically worse on live. It's not "more valuable" when it does 1/10th of what it does on Pservers for dodge and parry. That's ridiculous. You just can't push that stuff off the table anymore and it's pointless to try. +15 weapon skill is a whopping 0.6% chance to reduce dodge/parry.
---
You just insulted me and didn't even explain your reasoning for being a massive asshole.
---
Layering is supposed to create multiple copies of the entire world that each have a similar capacity to what the original servers did at launch.  We conjecture that not many people got invited to the beta, but was it even enough to be able to push either realm to the original server capacity?  Probably not, from what little hard numbers I can find.  
---
They want the tech to perform well, and that means the possibility that some servers will have 10+ layers at some points.  No way they can make sure everything works well unless they seriously lower what a "similar capacity" *means*.  Instead of a size of 2-3k, I'm sure they have set the capacity ranging from a few dozen players to several hundred.  This is also gonna look super weird to the users, since such small numbers would mean layers get spun up or down at a much higher rate than they would at launch.  That's the only way to test your "worst case" without inviting 100k+ people to play on a few servers.  
---
Well, that's discounting the stress tests.  I think the last stress test will have settings for layering configured to be close to what they will be for launch.  I'm going to reserve my ultimate judgement on being for or against it until after the last stress test, when I believe we'll see layering in its true form.
---
I never liked frost elemental. It felt like a neutered pet, rather than a fun tool, but I know alot of people also enjoyed it a ton.
---
Damn I get so excited at the thought that we might get BC again after Classic gets its due time
---
While DPSing, I'd rather be pressing one button than trying to play a gimmicky minigame in a raid, which is how Modern DPS rotations feel to me personally.
---
Resto was insanely better. Feral also got better aoe threat and survivability (plus resiliance made defense capping easy)
---
Donnie was my favorite new character they had when they came back with new episodes, they ruined him by keeping him as Donna.

---
I love so much that they always tried to build on the lore that already existed. (For context, this map would have been pre-1994 when wc1 was released).
---
Fury Warriors for sure were better in Vanilla.
---
I hated how it was in TBC so I rerolled.
---
Ty will check this when I get to my desktop
---
Fury warriors went from gods of late vanilla to just okay. BC wasn't very melee friendly and fury warriors weren't terrible just not as good as classic.
---
Except it used to be less in your face. It wasn't immersion breakingly obvious that the game is 50% pop culture references.
---
One person in a three man group going healer opens up so many more opportunities. If the hunter was an spriest this 3 man would be unstoppable. Spriest can heal and boost the damage of the lock with shadow weaving, offer dispels for the warrior, and make dungeon group forming basically instantaneous.
---
Coordinating what? Mage press frostbolt over and over or warlock press shadowbolt over and over?  Its already brain dead for most specs.
---
nothing helped me rather than actually playing them adn see which one you like ...i HIGHLY suggest get on "retroWOW" free lvl 60 try some pvp and see how it feels at 60.
---
&gt;everyone I know that’s going to play Classic is going Alliance. 
---
It's the correct decision. Horde capital cities suck.
---
It's definitely going to be less rare now lol
---
Just before Warlords came out. I was only passively playing MoP because both of my raiding guilds died at the end of Cata. I came back to play a little Legion just before BFA hit (curse you free weekend!) but canceled again when I got all my toons to 110.
---
I hated the very premise of Warlords of Draenor. Everything about it made me angry. I even hated playing through it - turns out you can do about a week’s worth of Tiller dailies to skip almost the whole thing, which is exactly what I did for half my alt army. Fuck you, Draenor.
---
Selling portals won’t be so lucrative with 15-20% of the player base being mages... mages who are also competing with you for the same AOE grind spots.
---
It’s unclear if BRD farming will be viable (whether the humanoid mobs will have nets added or not).
---
It will probably be something super boring like grinding animals for leather.
---
Odds of being full on healers means resto druids usually aren't turned away. You just figure out who's handling renew/regrowth on the tank.
---
Bro, I can't play a single game and we are still 7 weeks out. 
---
Played 8.2 and made enough gold to push my sub until next June... prices dropped and I just can't find anything to grab my attention for at least 2-3 weeks.
---
Whoa, I remember the original. Blast from the past!
---
Pretty much why I made this thread. Portals are nice coin every now and then, but you’re not gonna get rich quick just sitting in IF selling portals.
---
A queue is how a full layer world be handled. What did you think would happen?
---
Pretty much this. 
---
The reason I said 400G is because that’s what I remember it on the AH for. Even at 150 it’s still not worth it. I think I would buy one around 100-120 max.
---
I’ve been seeing this a lot. I’m so out of the loop what is this all about?
---
Droprate is low tho, and I feel like those spots will be heavily contested
---
It’s all closer together on that map
---
Layering is literally the exact same thing as merging servers down the line but without having to deal with duplicate names for users or guilds. It also allows you to meet people from the servers you’ll eventually merge with ahead of time... why are so many of you people against this? I’d rather that then 3 months down the line have my server get merged with a bunch of ransoms I could’ve never possible encountered until then.
---
I really like the website, maybe you could add whether it’s on US-West/East or EU or such.
---
That's why i said relatively speaking. It didn't get any nerffs, unless you start comparing hear or something.
---
It's obvious that a lot of us don't enjoy them. If we did we wouldn't be reporting them all.
---
Sell portals, and just grind mobs. Like just literally kill mobs. You can also aoe loads of level 40-50 mobs with good trash.
---
In a non-mean way, were you expecting any answer that was comprised of not grinding mobs?
---
You must be a twitchbaby that doesn't understand people.
---
Ya that's why I said it wasn't 'way' ahead anymore.
---
This. I hear a lot of people discussing their plans outside of the sub, so I was curious.
---
I'm just as excited guys - great way to share the excitement!
---
For the sake of epic World PvP I sure hope so
---
That sounds really nice! Popups when entering a zone aren't the most difficult part to implement. Could you send me a message with a sample? Mainly asking because if the text is too large, I'll need to make a scrolling panel which I tried to do but failed :D But it should of course be doable if I google around a bit.
---
Exactly. Since Classic Launch was announced (April?), I've moved to a different game every 2 weeks
---
Are you saying optimal or just viable? There were top end guild that didn't being any to some raids. I would imagine a lot of people still took them.
---
How do I find someones contact information if they accept a guild invite through the website? I can't find this persons information at all
---
edgy
---
The other three replies are getting close to the reason, but just missing the mark. You want to activate autoshot before every time you attack. You want an auto shot to be your first attack. The reason for this is because auto attacks are on a timer, and your spell shots can happen at any time. So, you pull with auto attack, then immediately cast a second shot (while moving) and that is a better DPS rotation than pulling with serpent sting (or any other spell). So, you want auto-shot on your bars so you can pull with an auto shot.
---
Here’s the scoop and I’m gonna tell ya... 
---
1. Gosh I hope not 
---
2. I’m going to take an educated guess and assume I’m not
---
3. I’ve spent a fair amount of IRL money on my toons over the years. More if you count realm and faction changes over the years to play with friends/family
---
Now, the actual scoop thing:
---
I played an orc warrior to 60 in 2015. I tanked ubrs 20/15/10, scholo 15/10. Live and Dead. I re-rolled to a paladin (lolret) in early 2016, and ended up RetShocking my way up to Twin Emps before my guild shattered on C’Thun. 
---
That paladin was started on launch day of a server called Altar of Storms. The first week I could barely login to play my toon due to population limits, let alone actually tag and kill ANYTHING even while grouped up with 4 randoms having the same problem. I still remember the frustration vividly. 
---
That’s why I’m pro-layering. Huzzah?
---
It's not that hard to get there solo as a mage. You can even solo the last boss as a mage without amazing gear.
---
I think you meant to type LF healer and tank lol
---
The numbers private servers get are nothing compared to the numbers Classic will get especially on launch. Like it or not layering is the only way to go for first few months until things start to slow down. This has been explained over and over again, you need to read up on it until you understand why this is a necessary solution.
---
If you don’t want layering, start playing in December.
---
Been playing from a few months after launch to I want to say a few months into MoP. Got my dragon, had my farm set up, started some new rep grind for something.... All I remember is that it unlocked the rep grind for ANOTHER faction and that was the last straw for me.
---
Personally I started with about 6 months left of vanilla and leveled a night elf hunter (classic) to 40 before switching to a night elf priest. I never really experienced the horde until I switched over in wotlk and I fell in love. I have mixed feelings about what I want to play. On one hand I love hanging out with guildies in comms in Ironforge (the nostalgia is so real lol) and I feel like the lore and questing is a bit more loved by the devs so I would like to experience that. 
---
Horde players? What did you love about being horde in vanilla? Am I missing out? I am a horde player for life, but there’s something about replaying with the alliance like I am 14 again that sounds so fun to me.
---
Not trying to be condescending. Just play the game.
---
That remark is pretty condescending
---
Play Dark Souls to make WoW leveling a breeze by comparison.
---
I was elected to lead, not to read!
---
They will yes and on the first week the 10,000 people around level 10-20 will be where? In the starting areas which will be flooded. Layering is temporary solution to stop this from happening. It’s not a permanent thing.
---
That's pretty spot on for my ideal 5 man -depending on the day of the week.
---
Running as a group full time my ideal runners would be
---
* Prot Paladin(Imp BoW -&gt; BoSanc)
---
* AoE Mage(Slow Blizz)
---
* Warlock(??? idk how these work. Summon please?)
---
* Shadow Priest
---
* Boomkin Druid as Healer
---
Mage + Warlock for the running instances non stop and giving ports/summons as needed. Mana Heavy group so unlimitted water is a plus. Int benefits the group. Heavy on the AoE kiting so
---
Prot Paladin. More so to round up AoE pulls for the Mage to slow with Blizzard. Also solid on the BoW being passed around to the mana heavy group.
---
Shadow Priest for Stam buff and steady group heals. If I was to swap out a class it would be this for a Clever Trap -&gt; BM Hunter. Aspect of the Pact would be nice for some faster running at times and would add a lot of gear diversity to the group. Although if Suvival Hunter came you would likely need a resto druid instead of a bad ass
---
Boomkin Healer. Improved Thorns on tank synergies great with Retribution Aura and the AoE pull mentality. Boomkin would be in the toughest position needing to know when he can deal some extra burst with that sexy Owlbear Crit Aura(when Shadow Priest Healing is enough). The large cooldown on Hurricane is less of an issue when the character is officially healing and clawing his mana back up(Judgement of Wisdom please pally?) and procing those omens of clarity. When the group dies tho, its because the Boomkin evolved into an Oomkin. Not to worry though because
---
wow would this party have a lot of ups. Warlock Soulstones the Druid so if anyone else dies he can combat rez. If that falls through we still got the paladin that can Divine intervention the shadow priest thats cowering in a safe position. Paladin and Druid die with no SS or DI out? Thats fine, the 3 DPS are actually a full party. Warlock busts out a Voidwalker to offtank as the Mage AoE kites everything in circles. Priest meanwhile realizes they need to save the party, again, and begins prioritizing spirit tap targets for the high mana regen as the heals come flowing out.
---
Too bad I think my 3 friends that are playing are all going rogue. I'll probably be a tank trying to maintain aggro with no heals as they all vanish and cackle at my death.
---
Good Luck [u/Filipino\_Ray](https://www.reddit.com/user/Filipino_Ray/), good luck.
---
Cope? It's a fucking game, dude. If you're so invested in an imaginary faction that it upsets you to change sides, seek help. 
---
Started as Horde in Vanilla, loved the 'underdog' theme Horde had before the xpacs started. Stayed with them until sometime around WotLK when Wyrmrest Accord launched. I'd had my fill of my pvp servers and wanted to wallow in RP for a change. Heard Alliance is the side for RP, so I rolled Alliance on WrA and that was my home until I quit in MoP.
---
Realistically, unless you are farming ubrs for a really long time and not raiding, you will get something better long before you get dal'rends, such as Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers. This is assuming you are not just an ass and need rolling on it over rogues &amp; warriors.
---
Expansions should add content. Cataclysm actively removed content. That's why it is my most hated wow xpac. It may not even be the worst xpac as BFA is way more of a slog than cata ever was but even so I hate that thing on principle.
---
&gt;Stonewind Keep
---
wait what?
---
That first comment talking about how they're gonna get together for D3.. 
---
I too remember when I was optimistic about new things Blizzard made.
---
Yikes how much more cringe can you get lol
---
A few reasons.  Not sure why you think it is lonely either.  I will most likely being hanging out with people in discord.
---
* First reason is I will be leveling with 2 sets of friends.  One group needs a tank, the other group needs a healer.  Easier to just level them at the same time.
---
*  Another set of professions.  Warrior will be mine/eng and the priest can then use tailor/chant
---
* Ease of soloing when grinding or other wise alone.  Can just watch some TV while  I grind out the levels
---
I'm in this boat... Definitely prefer Undeads aesthetics, though wanna play Rogue where WotF and Stun resist are both gonna be useful, except Stun resist has the upper hand (arguably). But Undeads simply don't have that pretty damn hefty damage cooldown.
---
25% increased AD right? That sounds pretty nuts, though I haven't yet seen it in effect.
---
just heal him and ask him not to use it instead of being petty
---
I'm treating you like the child you are.
---
I let out an awkward chortle during class when I read this comment. Well done!
---
It was obviously a joke yes, but even as a joke it made no sense. Auto loot was already in classic the speed didn't change. For his joke to work the looting speeds would have to be at least slightly different.
---
Says the dumb ass who claims there is only a "tiny amount of people who want to play Classic" cmon dont be so fucking stupid.
---
Flying mounts I think work well in TBC because it definitely has a space feel to it and you needed flying mounts to do botanica, mechanica, and alcatraz and those were all required for karazhan attunement. It really wasn't immersion breaking in that Xpac. Flying mount became immersion breaking when they brought it to azeroth in cataclysm.
---
Started as Horde on a PvP server, plan to roll Alliance on a PvP server or RP-PvP if it exists. Main reason? I want pretty saber mounts. I've never gotten a NE to max level, so I might as well try to this time.
---
"Common as shit", it's actually getting amusing now. Please keep going. I imagine you being one of those who actually didn't play but so desperately tries to pretend you did. If you can find me one screenshot of a chatbox where someone says "LFM x, y reserved" from vanilla, preferably from before TBC prepatch and massive bonus points for relatively early on (aka before everyone was fully geared already and were just boosting alts), I'll gladly shut up and accept defeat. 
---
Just ONE screenshot, one shred of evidence that it was a thing, go on mate.
---
Don't forget to get the [fridge/toilet/microwave seat](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8d/18/23/8d182356ea3764701c0032c5c35dde5f.jpg) for maximum drinking, eating, pissing and pooping.
