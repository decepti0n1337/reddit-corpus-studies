Gotta wait like 15-20 min

And maybe you belong in retail where everything is balanced for care bears like yourself.
---
It might have caused a psychological scar cause as he continued wow playing he was obsessed with leveling alts. His account is litered with like 2 dozen alts which were all max lvl mains/alts during the xpac he played it.
---
First off, being able to clear MC within 11 weeks since launch is not hardcore by any stretch of the imagination. I'm sure this may come as a surprise, but MC is an extremely easy raid that requires little to no effort. It's mostly just an excuse to shoot the shit with your guildies for 3 hours and have a good time. 
---

---
Secondly, what is with this casual v. hardcore obsession? I've never even seen these terms have any effect on the game (ie "hardcore gamers" ganking known "casuals.") The only time I've ever seen this distinction is on these types of threads, with people like yourself complaining about problems that simply aren't there. Like releasing phases on a faster time table is going to take away the game experience for people still leveling.
---
Yup, I've seen several recipe campers mysteriously disappear forever.
---
You can do it on the Alliance if you go to the keep in Durotar
---
I didn't think they were that funny...
---
Other than having an alt reset dungeon while everyone else just logs to chat screen , maybe sending minor speed increase and some decent boots to alts for leveling . Depending on your gold stack
---
My sides!!
---
Yknow what man, Im gonna be honest.
---
I cared a little.
---
Yes, that definitely helps, thanks. I've been standing very close to mobs, mostly habit from trying to avoid asspulling in dungeons. I'll start keeping my distance when possible.
---
No changes
---
Quite possibly. I tried to watch for stuff like that, but it's certainly possible I missed something.
---
It usually goes:

Sunder

Frostbolt/shadowbolt/mind blast

Oh fuck , I had to wait 15-20 after I cleanse?!

That’s bullshit

But thank you, I’ll have to go back and wait
---
The biggest secret in Classic WoW for wars that was kept from me (at least I have never seen it written down or in a video or anything) is that The Nicker for Orcs fucking PUMPS with windfury in raids and is easy af to get. Fish like a motherfucker with hamstring for WF procs and flurry uptime. When you're not raiding, focus on keeping flurry up with hamstring and you'll get the feel for it. It has 4.0 speed.
---
Heavily depends on your servers price for arcane crystal and blue sapphires.
---
It would cost me if I went to AH and bought right now probably 1200g+craft fee of 30g on my realm.
---
Easier for yourself would probably mean that you create dm east jump runs groups as a tank and reserve the nodes in the end and just do that over and over for crystals/sapphires if you got mining.
---
Players giving DHKs is one of the worst ideas that I see the playerbase constantly bring up.
---
The problems it would cause are immeasurable.
---
From my experience:
---
Tanks complain about tanking. 
---
Healers complain about healing.
---
DPS complain about not blasting.
---
All you have to do is just use dark/demonic runes, major mana potions, nightfin, greater arcane elixir, elixir of shadow power and flask of supreme power and you should be top 10 dps every time for boss fights (best guild on my server). I've been on the allstar boards 5-7 rank a couple times already for spriest. Most people don't know how to play spriest though even though you literally just dot and rotate Mind blast, mindflay, mindflay over and over. No one wants to commit to this every week and wants to just rat up a MC spot and try to get anathema. That's why no one likes shadowpriest.
---
ST has the added benefit of being enough out of the way it won't be a complete shitshow like Blackrock Mountain
---
Mind control has a very short range, so unlikely.
---
Aggro only leashes so far. Just keep running.
---
wait dk are going to be implemented? what does this mean to the ppl that raid citys?
---
is there a way to view my classic character the same way you can view your retial character? see all the stats, gear, etc?
---
Absolutely, being polite and willing to ask questions seems to be they key.
---
I’m totally cool with people needing items they think of as an upgrade, but others are touchy. Easiest thing to do, “Can I roll need?” If asked why, present a simple justification.
---
For 99% of folks I’ve encountered, they’ll be totally cool with it because you’ve proven yourself to be considerate.
---
You come across as a major baby here dude. Are you on a pvp server?
---
Youtube downvotes on a cinematic mean nothing. Last I checked it was 22,000 downvotes.... 22 thousand. This game has millions of fans. 22 thousand is nothing. It may be the most downvoted but that really isn't saying much.
---
use twitch app for add-ons catalog, downloading and usage in future
---
For me I could care less what other people think of me. I would trade a bunch of people thinking I'm weird for the joy and laughter of my friends every day of the week.
---
Wow theres the filthy casuals then theres the max level no-lifers then theres multiboxers then theres you.  You are so boring its embarrassing.
---
There's a shitload of changes already
---
People are literally doing it in less than 40 minutes already. Check warcraftlogs
---
No nut November taking its toll eh ?
---
The lore has absolutely always sucked.
---
You're not wrong, you can have the same interactions if you put the effort into it.
---
But in my experience, the LFD takes away a lot of that interaction and most players are happy for it all to be automated so it dies quietly in the background.
---
[removed]
---
What does a stack go for on your server?
---
Depends if you're horde or not, windfury is very good with slow weapons. Better to dump rage into all abilities that can proc WF instead of using a dagger and spam HS to dump it, HS for a horde should be avoided if all possible.
---
“All this PvP on my PvP server!!! What ever will I do”
---
I learned my lesson 15 years ago
---
Mana efficiency is only one consideration.  It's important, but throughput and more significantly the distribution of your healing matters.  This is why you use Chain Heal for raid healing even when Healing Wave is more efficient (it already is more efficient once you have any kind of decent gear, even without the tier 1 bonus).
---
Fire reflector.
---
&gt; These damn hypocrites are the same one who cried wolf saying "bUt LeVeLiNg Is PaRt Of ThE vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe" 
---
I don't think "crying wolf" means what you think it means
---
And are people really asking blizzard not to turn on honor?  Complaining about how bad it will be for 50s, is not the same as actually asking Blizzard not to do it.
---
Kind of a bittersweet hello...
---
Is everyone from your guild trying to get the Tidal Charm or do you just stay to help your guildmates? I swear I see at least 3 different Look Alive members camping Prince Nazjak everyday.
---
People already do that.
---
57. I had done the grind and could farm dungeon groups with my guildies, it was the first consistant time to playing with them and it's been great since. Just downed ony.
---
and $&gt;everything amirite?
---
I rolled a 2 on Viskagg the other day. felt like a kick in the balls
---
NICE
---
Just hit 48, not looking forward to my last 12 levels
---
You can use dueling for that too
---
25min exactly, then you can loot it again 25min after that.
---
Yeah it is that fast now with 1.12 itemization and the knowledge we have of the game. My guild is made up mostly of people who are married and have kids and full time jobs. We just dedicate one night to MC and usually clear in about 2 hours. As long as your group is fairly competent this is easily achievable being a normal adult with responsibilities
---
Extendedcharacterstats is an addon that calculates and shows the info that is missing from regular character sheet, so you can see spell crit, spell damage etc.
---
I might just quit until phase 3.
---
It is ridiculously useful and has 0 drawbacks from turning it on.
---
Maaan im still tryna get through STV at level 36
---
Right now I’m halfway to lvl 39 on my main. Definitely going to start putting more time in because I want to get to more end game content. But this was nice to read. I still feel like I’m lvling slow as all hell. 6 days /played so far

I just tanked a scholo run with a 58 hunter. His pet pulled aggro and wiped us twice. He body pulled I dunno how many times.

I won't go back with any dps that isn't 60

You know, it's hilarious to me -- and I'm not gonna take the time to dissect your comment history BUT statistically speaking, it's probably a good guess to say you'd be included -- that game forums are RIDDLED with pro libertarian nonsense whenever politics get discussed....but let a game company implement those libertarian capitalistic values and those same neets will lose their fucking minds.

Why don't you go roll a tank? It's an awful job when you have to put up with dps making nasty jibes at you the entire run. Just stfu and don't pull aggro. DPS accordingly to how geared and skilled your tank is. THAT'S SKILL not 'pushing mad numbers bro'
---
I tanked as a fresh 60 against a well geared lock. Lock pulled aggro constantly and all the dps made jokes about being hit my all the mobs. It was 'kinda in jest' because with his gear, i had no chance on maintaining threat, but it still made to entire run awful and i hated tanking it. 
---
We have 1 taunt every 10 seconds. If you hellfire 5 mobs before we've swung twice and then you shit on the tank for it? We can taunt assuming no resist 1 mob, mocking blow if no resist a second mob, but for the next 9 seconds, those 3 mobs are all yours.

---
Just a heads up to anyone reading this, there’s a few quests involving Giants in STV and you can kite them to Booty Bay and the guards will take care of them for you.
---
lol focussing on the level of the characters instead of the fact that there's 40 of them
---
Hey man if I wanna wiggle while I dps you let me wiggle while I dps.  It's not indicative of me being anxious to finish the dungeon, I just enjoy dancing around mobs while I mindlessly press 2-3 buttons, ok?
---
You get a cheap epic mount at rank 11. I grinded to rank 11 in vanilla since I was too cheap to grind gold. Looking back at it, I could probably have made enough gold to buy five epic mounts in the time it took me to reach Lieutenant General.
---
Okay if you consider the fact that the logs show I'm at 95-99% on fights, dropping to 90 if I have an assignment like tranqing or pulling, it means I'm close doing as much damage as a hunter possibly can.
---
This means out of 15,000 hunters I'm in the top 100 to top 50.
---
Rogues and warrs still beat me VERY handily on more than 3/4 the fights.
---
Want to know why?
---
Because that's just how the classes were designed.
---
Compounded further by the fact that a lot of world buffs/buffs suck for hunter:
---
No RAP from Blessing of Might, Ony Buff, DM Fengus buff. 
---
Warrs and rogues dip into str and agi elixirs, we only get agi scaling. 
---
Juju might, firewater, etc don't do shit for us. 
---
So long story short, the hunter toolkit is amazing compared to rogue/warr but saying they have amazing DPS and that they should place top5 all the time just means your rogues and warrs are pretty bad or relaxing. There is no rivalling those two on the meters. Yeah, maybe Onyxia you can top the charts (I do) but even rogues can rival that with yellow strikes and a short phase 2.
---
The logs and numbers don't lie.
---
ITT people salty the op had fun.
---
Glad you had a fun interaction OP, this sort of stuff is what makes WoW feel like a world.
---
It really isn't going to be that bad for lowbies, 60's don't get honor from you, they aren't going to waste their time farming low level zones that don't attract 50+'s.  50+ zones are going to be war.  And of course hillsbrad will be a constant battle.  But most of the rest of the world will be fine, you are just slightly more likely to have to fight the other random lowbies around you.
---
To add on to the "so what", many people have been raiding for 6+ weeks now and have basically nothing to show for it.  You definitely won't be too far behind.
---
Fuq the grind never stops !
---
You're somehow more cringey than Athene. Congrats.
---
What addon are you using for enemy CD's?
---
Lol what. PVP gives the world danger and gives the Alliance/Horde dichotomy meaning. Some of the best just for fun events are the huge raids on cities. I never start pvp fights but if someone needs help or if I'm getting ganked I'm all in. The issue is when Phase 2 releases and servers are ridiculously imbalanced one way or another.
---
If you think phase 6 is the end of classic you will be in for a surprise. Look up burning crusade
---
i feel ya  i have been doing homework the whole day thinking i  would just finish it and hop on to wow  i guess i know why i am so slow i constantly get distracted ...  sht i am almost done but now its 3  am and i  wanna sleep (but also play wow  but i cant because too tired)             (thomas had never seen such bs before)
---
How are you getting Fear off on any Rogue without using Deathcoil first, though?
---
To each their own, but that would basically go against the prime reason people wanted classic in the first place. 
---

---
I used this alllll the time to find mithril in The Chared Veil.
---
&gt;there are still plenty of casuals playing even on ultra-competitive pvp servers
---
You keep telling yourself that lie while looking at no less then 5 people *lose their fucking minds* that someone doesn't have a mount at 44.
---
&gt; I believe Classic requires you to visit the connecting flight paths in order to travel between certain areas.
---
This is correct, if you do not have the connecting FP then you will get a message like "you have no connections" or something like that.
---
You can feign with your pet still spawned. You just have to wait until your pet dies to get up from FD.
---
God I want it. It what druid is meant to be.
---
I love druid, but the game's push into healer is frustrating. The pvp set is perfect.
---
So I’ve been walking around with a carrot on a stick in my ear?
---
These threads are the worst. Why does everyone feel the need to tell people that they are levelling at their own pace? Just do it and stop telling us, no one cares. If youre enjoying it you wouldnt feel a need to let everyone know how much fun youre having.
---
Boy that path is part of a fucking journey of a quest chain all about lore, jesus christ me and a couple of people went from killing steelsnap to wandering all over the damn place.
---
Alliance have quests that send them right through the thing.

---
P. S. I didn't 'distract' from the fact. Scroll up. I agreed with the toolkit. My very words were just saying that 'amazing dps' is pretty off, even now in phase 1 and 2, especially since hunters fall off very hard for 66% of classic.
---
Bootybaygazette is only good if you pay the three dollars a month for the site too
---
Back when alt tabbing took 3 minutes
---
Not true.
---
It really is a lot about pull range, a level 50 would pull the whole lyceum every step they take, for example.
---
Rogue flair checks out.
---
30 minutes for a free 750-1250 dmg absorb? i think that’s pretty good. It’s not like you’ll find yourself needing to use it every 10 minutes..
---
I didn't know DMT gave you the runs...
---
Set bonus requires tailoring?
---
I when I first started playing in vanilla, I thought they were earrings that would show on your character. I was sooooo excited to get my first trinket only to realize you couldn’t see shit....
---
Say the same thing again. Prove me wrong that you accused me of being a libertarian after making a comment saying that money shouldn't be everything.  Go stick your head back in the sand because you aren't doing the world any favors by sticking it in the light.
---
You can also sync your addons with Twitch. Then when you install wow and twitch it will sync your addons to the new MacBook.
---
The first instance of and the one I remembered most clearly is a pug I was in. My buddy (rogue) and I (mage) puged a late night run of Strath for my hat and his cape. We got whisper from a priest saying she got a Warrior DPS with her, when they joined the warrior said after a few mins "I'll tank if we can't find one", so we got a lock.
---
I did half expect him to put on a shield, but at the time I have already ran into DPS warrior tanking, and for the most part it's up to the player skill and healer, but if they are a combo it's usually a good sign. He didn't put on a shield, and we moved at a very fast pace compared to other strath runs we were in.
---
I'm, not just talking about one or two experiences with seeing high level dungeon  tanking, I've grinded a great deal and in my experience, with all things equal (skill, communications, gear) DPS/AoE tanking pulls ahead.
---
One of the reasons me and my friend rerolled as tank and healer is because we're tired of running slow runs. Tired of tanks and healers constantly moving at a snails pace, insisting on healers having 80%+ mana, CCing everything and having single target pulls when we have 2 mage, marking everything the entire dungeon, and when that is done.
---
It's ok to make mistakes, its ok to wipe, and its ok to take a long ass time to do something when you are trying for the first time as long as its to improve yourself, your group, your guild.
---
Solo mage was super hyped at the beginning and I joined the hype wagon, but I died hundreds of time and lagged behing, but eventually resulted is me pulling ahead in leveling. Even with 4 Mage AoE groups, teaching a new mage or priest to do the AoE/AE groups properly might take a few runs but when we get it down it goes smooth and we can continue to count on those people.
---
The fact that everyone seems so determined to wait until they beyond overgear before they speed clear is ridiculous. There are pug groups that are doing it.  Classic is not vanilla, everyone has the knowledge and ability to do way better but chose to gimp themselves.
---
kk :) thanks for the response. kromcrush it is!
---
i really want to be on a full server anyway, more the merrier
---
&gt;  shadow mastery only apllies to the spells base damage while the +15% from sacc scales with +dmg because it applies to your total damage dealt.
---
Do you have a source for that? Because I'm roughly 99.9993% sure it's incorrect.
---
I in fact just recently respecced back into SM, while wearing a ton of +shadow damage gear, and saw my total damage output go up by the correct amount.
---
It’s Danny Devito, so clearly this implies gnome mage players.  The rest should be off the hook.
---
What does any of this have to do with the writing/story of WoW?
---
Just get someone to invite your char and then 1 alt, alt will get leader after 2 min so you can reset the dungeon yourself
---
Let everyone in the group know you are new. Ask someone to mark targets for you at first, until you are comfortable picking your own target order. Learn your rotations.  I would suggest getting comfortable panning with your mouse to watch the party/keep an eye on ads. You dont need to watch the enemies right in front of you. YOu need to keep an eye on your healer in case something breaks off on them/targets them.  Learn to tab target. 
---
And never forget the number skill for tanks: blaming the other guys :D
---
Wailing caverns sucks anyway.  It's long and winding. And everyone loots the mushrooms while you are busy tanking.
---
Tanks can itemize to never be behind on threat so I'd take WF all day. Salv is more noob friendly tho.
---
ya ik wouldnt want an auto placing lfg tool like the kind in retail heroics and it wouldnt eliminate wait times but the retail board posting lfg is so much better as you can post and get notified whenever someone applies rather then spamming lfg chat every 1 min for 30 mins straight or watching the lfg chat scroll for an hour straight waiting for a group without a rogue
---
I've never had any problems I just ran in from darkshire
---
Your husband, if he’s a veteran of the game, should take up a little of this slack and help with this until you get a good feel.
---
A couple tips, that aren’t 100% never deviate rules but good enough while leveling
---
1) Pull mobs to you and pull them around a corner wall, especially if there are enemy casters. Chances are if they have mana, you’ll want to do this. It’s called “LoS” or line of sight. They can’t attack you if they can’t see you so they are forced to run to you, because you’re the only one on the threat table. The healer should be behind you as he/she should be the only one who may get Aggro during a pull.
---
2) Kind of along with the above, kill casters first. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but most runs are made harder by leaving casters alive while focusing on melee attackers.
---
3) Remember which enemies run away when they get low on health.  Hit them with a hamstring right before they start to run away. This will take practice, and good DPS should be doing this already, but if not, a tank doing it can avoid many wipes.
---
4) If you aren’t familiar with the dungeon, let your DPS know that when they join the group. You and the husband are the two most important roles, so if DPS get shitty about it, kick them and find another. There are plenty of good silent players that don’t mind or actively help (especially on PvE servers) new players.
---
5) Don’t be afraid to ask questions. I’ve been playing this game for 15 years.  I’ve never played melee DPS before Classic and now I’ve got a 60 Fury Warrior. I just learned something new today because I asked a question on something I didn’t have a complete grasp of, despite having ready many guides and watched videos on the exact topic.
---
Someone laid it out in an easier to understand way for how I learn, and it’s made me a more knowledgeable and hopefully better player.
---
6) Ignore the whiners. Play what makes you happy. The journey from 1-60 is a great journey and if you want to tank then by all means tank. Don’t give up because a few random ass hats weren’t happy you aren’t perfect on your first character.
---
7) Have fun.
---
Enjoy WarCraft. It’s pretty good.
---
I've seen it listed on auction between 250g-500g. I thought the price was going to drop a lot after DM launched, but it did not appear to cause the list prices to go down. I put down a bid and won mine for 271g a couple of weeks ago. I wouldn't spend much more than that.
---
you......replied.......to......the comment?

Idk what is going on here, but like..........you should read more or something jesus.
---
&gt;I don't see any giant threads full of crying PVErs whining Blizz is releasing Phases too fast, do you?
---
One of the top threads on this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/df33fx/blizzard_on_behalf_of_casuals_please_slow_down/
---
But unlike you I realise not everyone that likes PvE is exactly the same person, same with PvP. Honestly? I could want the honor system yesterday, I can't wait for it! And i'm an ally on a 30/70 ally/horde server. So why is your only argument that PvP servers are bad is that you don't like PvP server players?
---
That's pretty generous. Usually the projectiles start flying before the tank even gets to the mobs.
---
Because a priest has bloodrage....
---
Why are you so upset that I mentioned a wierd bug that happens? I don’t know what triggers it, but its always happens when I’ve max ranged a heal before drinking, or when the tank has entered combat while I am outside healing range, I heal, drink, and have been able to heal again and drink.
---
This is terrible advice
---
I'm not sure if you can imagine this but you posted on a public forum. Expect responses from multiple people.
---
I kinda tired of seeing the same meme every day.
---
Cute!
---
Uh yeah it was. But feel free to tell me about my experiences and life. Im curious as to what you have to say /s
---
They could easily wait another month for phase 2. Its untenable for most people to hold down a full time job and level to 60 in 2 months. Say it takes 10 days /played to 60, this is not unreasonable, although I know it is possible in much less time depending on playstyle, but this is a normal /played.  That would take ~4 hours a day of playing every day to do in two months. That isn't feasible for some people, many of them are the same people who consist of Blizzard's core base from 2004. Way to say fuck you to the people who built the foundation of your game.
---
I was blitzing through Mana on my ret pally using Max level seal of command, so I switched to using rank 1 most of the time, any downside to doing this?
---
You need growl to go off on cooldown unless you have a *really* bad bow. One unfortunate white shot crit in the beginning is enough to pull agro on pet. 
---
If you want to try hard and do speed run strats you only growl once to specifically pull agro from pet and kill it before it reaches you so you don’t have to run to loot it. That’s a lot of effort, but definitely doable.
---
Don’t even need shield wall - just makes it more fun to heal
---
I'll watch a streaming pvper watching my corpse being watched by my ghost

My favorite is binding in-game sound bytes to abilities. I believe it’s something like /run PlaySound (sound number here). I found a list of all boss voiceovers. 
---
When my brother went to make food while logged into his hunter I replaced Feign Death with a matching icon to /cast Feign Death /run PlaySound and linked it to a sound byte of C’thun whispering in your ear “Your heart will explode.”
---
I purposely chose a skill he won’t spam every minute and waited, and yes, he threw his headphones off and yelled across the house “WHAT THE FUCK”
---
He had never done AQ so he had no idea what the sound was, just that his game told him he’s going to die. I just told him maybe it’s the zone he’s in (STV lol) or a glitch in the game. He eventually figured it out.
---
New player here, could someone help me set up a macro for overpower when I’m not in battle stance? I have one right now but I have to press it once to enter battle stance and then a second time to cast, also the tooltip doesn’t light up after the enemy dodges an attack (unless i’m already in battle stance).

Any help appreciated

&gt; Killing us, owning us or soloing us is meaningless.
---
I mean yeah, these guys put a whole new standard of meaningless up, it's hard to beat.
---
Poor high chief winterfall.  It's no wonder he's always pacing nervously.
---
This is gold
---
Most servers are still very active.
---
I dinged 59 on my main today
---
Against Horde (Kurinaxx): Went to Alterac Mountains to find Mug'thol for a quest item (book on the shelf behind him) when I spotted an undead rogue scouting the area before heading into the building to solo Mug'thol. I watched him solo the elite ogre and when both were below 20% hp I ganked him and finished the elite, looted, and hearthed around the corner. #roguelife
---
What are you complaining about? Group the mobs, then let them take aggro. With 2 novas, blizzard, coc, the adds will never touch your mages. It's literally the best comp you can wish for, aggro, then sit back and just facilitate the life of the healer.
---
consider how bad the average player is
---
then consider that half the players are worse than that ;)
---
If you don't have enough rage then it means that you don't know how to itemize your character, which means that you do lack skill.   
---
Obviously if you roll tauren male, stack +defence gear and roll with 0% hit you will rage starve.
---
Yeah but you wanna be able to craft them.  So you gnomish then make all the gnomish shit unneeded that’s bop, like the death ray etc, then unlearn and redo as goblin.  Now you have all the gnomish bop shit and you can craft goblin shit yourself and not have to buy it or get a friend to craft for you.
---
Lol. Level 9 is something like 1/100th of the way there.
---
Well said
---
God i bonded with two randoms doing that quest, holy hell
---
\&gt; You can still be raiding MC (and enjoying the game) while others are on BWL. Why are you under the assumption the two are mutually exclusive?   
---
It gets more difficult to find people who are at the same point of progression as you if they release the content quicker. You will have less time to catch up and you will fall behind without a bit of buffer time for the people with full time jobs to get to the point were they can be prepared for raids. It's just more difficult trying to swim up the crest than riding the wave.
---
Responding to check later for answer.
---
Well shit, looks like I've been doing it wrong this entire time.
---
I can't see pugs where people don't use consumes, and half of them are meme / inefficient  specs beating Huhu
---
Is there a way to check for rares in lbrs? Can a rogue sneak down close enough for instance?
---
I'm the exact same. Yesterday after MC someone whispered me to tank Strat UD. It was midnight then. I ended up doing a Scholo afterwards and went to bed at 3h30 am even though I had to wake up at 6 am -_-
---
What was the impact to your damage?
---
I don’t know for ret pally specifically, but most classes down ranking for damage really isn’t efficient when looking over a period of time at cost vs. damage. 
---
It’s more about utilities for down ranking such as a rank 1 frost bolt to apply a slow or rank 1 banish to have a shorter time.
---
Thats very low
---
You have to pretty much blatantly lie to yourself and everyone else to say that a PvP server has any chance of being fun. We all know how people behave in online games. You're not fooling anyone people. We all know you aren't having "fun" being abused at every single opportunity.
---
What materials for nightfall do you think are the best buys? Like what material isn't really used in other recipes that will increase once you can make nightfall? I had a look at the materials but wasnt sure if there was a particular one with the most potential to rise.
---
Man if this is true I’m so happy to be done with Mara. That walk and the instance portals and the portal room were already the worst.
---
In closing, pvp is fun and everyone should do it... except paladins, just give up and reroll if your not holy.
---
Started playing 3 weeks ago, first time playing wow.. i'm 36 right now
---
What? Dude who is complaining...
---
I don't think I ever did 1.12 AV, I was already warlord and exalted with AV before 1.12.
---
Yes
---
No, we're all making fools out of ourselves.
---
+7 agility on gloves.
---
&gt;people in the group that can´t just relax for a moment
---
My wife can't relax too, we try to not think of it as a problem but actually maybe it is
---
Lol! I remember these two clowns from back in vanilla on lightenings blade server. 
---
They were a pain in the ass to deal with, glad to see they are back
---
What do you mean cringy? This is awesome!
---
I love how I read your comments and saw Apes and my first thought was it was an insult, until I found out that there’s a guild name Apes
---
May I ask what your real life situation is? I'm always interested in people who can play that much.
---
My mama says I am
---
hell yeah tho 
---
I'm so hyped for BRM wars 
---
just need herod alliance to fuckin pull it together so we don't wipe em all out
---
The ogre that drops the nicker is barely rare. It's literally there more often than not. Farming rivenspike is much harder and I believe the only way to check that is indeed with a rogue.
---
It would be kinda cool if you could pop the head in any of the major cities and they added a spot for them there’s I know SW is more integral to the Onyxia plot, but it would alleviate the problem.
---
Well with someone as much real world obligation as yourself, I have the utmost faith in your ability to find a guild of similarly situated people. Hell, if you are on Bigglesworth-Horde, there is a guild named &lt;Adults with Jobs&gt; that is explicitly intended for those progressing slower.
---
Why not just the dagger from dm that gives 6 dagger skill? Or is that weapon just not good enough?
---
Context depends. If you end up going dual wield tank it’s BIS, which many are doing. Sword and board not the best, and given you can get Qual it could easily be argued for a DPS.
---
No one cares about your stream.
---
Agree. They’re OP as hell in duels but 90% of the time in real, dynamic combat, they’re just oom.
---
But they are just using the 1.12 itemization not all the items from 1.12. We know nothing about what they plan for caster weapons, could absolutely go either way.
---
If a frost mage is pulling single target agro the problem is your tank.
---
Gehennas and Firemaw
---
Tank and hit gear both evade me.
---
Best is when the pyro arrives before the tank does and its a big crit. :D
---
/wave to the mage and watch him die, and just move on then.
---
Primarily Huge Emeralds and Dark Iron Bars. Dark Iron Bars are like... 4-5g on my server right now, and huge emeralds have been going on the AH for less than vendor price, so I've been snatching both of those up when I see them.
---
To be fair, it's as simple as him just leaving his computer signed in at any point, since you dont actually have to type in your username and password to log in.
---
Never seen this before.
---
Ok so 2 fights and maybe some trash you will use fire resist.
---
Ain't now laws when you're drinking claws bro
---
No, it means that their tank knows that in order to build threat you must take damage, thus itemize properly.
---
I was bitching about it while leveling not really a problem at 60 like I stated a bunch
---
&gt; Five sunders...
---
If you feel like spending 3 hours in MC.
---
Indeed but fury tanking still generates more tps if your tank knows what to do and how to gear properly. I'm not expert in this so I'd rather not speak more than what I know. Still, our guild speedclears mc under an hour with fury warriors and kills are extremely fast. I went to one pug not long ago and healers were ooming there because fights lasted so long even if the tank was using a shield. In the end speedrunning without a shield required much less healing although there's a very big difference in skill and preparation
---
"World PvP objectives" = sand ranking. I played private servers, believe me, it's aids you don't want to happen.
---
I fully agree with you I don't want the game to be balanced around pvp and I much prefer no resilience pvp. I just want the arenas for the ratings.
---
...why? What’s changing?
---
You can see the level of all enemies, both mobs and players, if you’re within 9 levels of them. Bosses (a special level that mobs can have) always show up as a skull, though. Functionally, these are level 63.
---
A low leveling having gold in the first place? 
---
"Robbed" is quite a stretch, more like scammed and what other social game doesn't have people trying to scam for ingame currency. Not condoning it, but it's a game after all.
---
Rather than use the numbers other people are throwing around, I'd instead say multiply your current play time by 0.6 at that level. It should take in to account the speed at which you personally level.
---
You payed 15$ for that
---
Real Madrid in fifa, brilliant
---
“Mostly” and pet classes
---
Same thing with necklaces, came from runescape where every item shows on your character (minus arrow slot) and was disappointed
---
We did it once with a 57 rogue and it was perfect. She was the first time there, but didnt manage to fuck it up once. She asked what boss x can, we answerd everything was fine. I have no problem with "low" lvl mates in my group as long as they dont fuck up multiple times! And if somebody dont know what boss x can, no problem we will write it down.
---
Its quicker threat, to be sure, but not more threat. Doing that on the pull is an excellent strategy. Swapping to berserker stance every time whirlwind is off cooldown is not.
---
Uhhhh what...on Illidan it took literally 15+ hours of playtime a day for a few months to get rank 14.
---
Thanks!
---
It’s an offhand only. So if you’re doing fury prot it’ll work, otherwise won’t.
---
I remember back in the wotlk when I had shitty wifi connection that I would disconnect during raiding if I used maxed particle density on certain bosses.
---
Class leaders just have a quick chat, they've got a wishlist from each player. Clearly their decisions are all very public and they're aware that if they do things unfairly people will just leave and join any one of the multitude of other raiding guilds. No issues so far.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk
---
I... have no argument against that. That's a pretty good idea lol. Thanks :P
---
lol
---
I got mine from killing mobs for the other quests and occasionally finding a soil patch on the ground.
---
Then I guess in the end it just depends on your experience because literally what you describe ive never once experienced. I've been playing at 60 for over a month now and I've not had one run where we CC'd anything except the times we do Scholo without a healer. 
---
It really isn't an issue of skill though for DPS tanking. It's gear. Your DPS warr isn't going to be in defensive stance throwing up sunders to get threat because that's awful. He's going to be whirlwinding for AoE aggro. If he's using a garbage weapon he isnt going to hold that aggro long. And then your healer ends up having to exhaust a ton of mana to keep the group alive thus defeating the purpose of tanking in that style. Whereas if you let the tank just mark skull, it dies near instantly and the tank has threat on everything so its just constant chain pulling.
---
&gt;everyone has the knowledge and ability to do way better but chose to gimp themselves.
---
I just can't agree with that man. Do you see some of these streams? People wiping on Gehennas or Geddon. How that is possible is beyond me. Doing a 5 man is literally harder than that because you have much less responsibility in a raid compared to a 5 man. Yet somehow people still mess up and cause wipe after wipe. Don't overestimate the majority of the playerbase. 
---
&gt;I've grinded a great deal and in my experience, with all things equal (skill, communications, gear) DPS/AoE tanking pulls ahead.
---
In the end I won't argue that Fury/Arms tanking isn't better for speed clearing. But for pugs, I believe it isn't smart. Especially when you can just focus nuke skulls down in a matter of seconds. If you disagree, thats alright man. Both of our experiences have influenced our viewpoint here significantly.
---
Welcome!
---
Why don't the DPS just use threat meters?  You can throttle based on real data rather than waiting for some ambiguous amount of sunders. As many have pointed out, 2 sunders is more than sufficient at this stage of game.
---
Except skeram is a horde pve server
---
That's not the point, it's that we shouldn't have to. If classic is really going on for a long time with only a finite amount of content releases what benefit is there to blasting through them? It's the mindset that Blizzard are displaying that is concerning to me. After all, they don't want people playing Classic and not Shadowlands.
---
Two.
---
1) Foror's drops off 1st boss DM:W, everyone needs. Tank loses roll. Begs for it. Winner offers him 50% discount from current AH price. Tank doesn't have. Winner offers 7 days to come up with gold. Tank: "but I work full time and don't have the time to farm that or know people to borrow". Tank gets upset winner won't hand over because tank can actually use, leaves. Winner's offer ends with him leaving instance. Big ol yikes.
---
2) Be me, a warlock. Join group for scholo mentioning all I am there for is skin of shadows and vectus for neck. Everyone cool with that. Be mostly pre-raid bis geared with a couple raid pieces, and doing some heavy DPS lifting for group. Do vectus. Neck actually drops. Holyfuck.mp4, im actually going to get uncommon drop. Need roll, "gratz" go out in chat. Check bags, can't find. Wtf.gif. Scroll through logs, the lvl 59 disc priest rolled and won. /Facepalm feelsbadman.jpg
---
Actually hamstring isn’t the rage dumb, it’s the prio skill to spam. Every WF proc basically doubles your rage generation. Once you start spamming WF you dump your rage with your other abilities
---
Dps, raid attendance, attitude, how much they do for the guild (like farming mats, etc)
---
Then how much it will benefit the raid as a whole. For instance one class might see a larger dps increase from an item than another class.
---
No, solo tanking makes it go quicker, because that's one more dps you're bringing. If I have my favorite healer, I also only bring 1 healer, so that's now 8 dps, and it flies by.
---
Maybe YOURS doesn't. But mine is 3 feet long.
---
In vanilla I did all end game content that a 50 healer can enter with a level 50 healer.  Healers were rarer, drop rates lower, and dps sucked so the healer being low level was the last of my worry as long as the math checked out on the ability to heal me through final boss.  
---
It's less of an issue this go around become the hivemind has accepted healer gameplay, so there are generally enough to go around.  But I'd still prefer a lower level healer with 20 points or more in to healing related tree and solid heal set rather than a higher level one that has all dps talents and poor gearing...which has occasionally been the case.  Bonus armor on crit heal type talents alone make up any difference.
---
Didn't know u were from the future
---
And he's talking about the corkscrew vaginal canal that leads to said uterus.
---
Too bad the spawn timers are so long. But yeah it's a chill place if you get it to yourself.
---
You only use hamstring when BT and WW are on CD. Point still stands that you sub hamstring for heroic strike
---
Yeah, those situations do suck, I sympathize.
---
I'll be honest, I ran all my dungeons for pre-bis with only casters except 1 rogue who I'm good friends with, and we agreed to trade off who got loot.

I still enjoy lasher farming. The gph has dropped significantly but it's a chill and safe farm.
---
What is your definition of “lose their fucking minds” lol? I play on grobbulus and like 25-40% are casual af.
---
Writing went downhill after the Lich King arc.
---
That whole arc was Metzen's peak and suffered terribly afterwards.
---
They replaced world building as a way of detailing and making a story robust with world building as a way of creating a story.
---
They stopped focusing on what they wanted to tell and started pandering, with things like lolpandas and time travel.
---
They always did pander, but it wasnt as widespread nor prolific.
---
On a boss, that's what, 5 extra seconds on each boss? I feel like wiping would make things much slower.
---
literally 4.5 seconds later than 2 sunders
---
Sold mine for 340g two weeks before DM released. Theyre still floating around on the AH for 340g-450g, but no one I know of has paid more than 350g. Whitemane Horde.
---
&gt;We don't wanna Google, YouTube, or WoWHead it.
---
And I don't want to look it up for someone unwilling to look it up for themselves.  Hire a secretary.
---
Oh man I did the tanaris one and was ganked 2v1 near the end.. I did have vengeance later in though when I soloed someone doing the same q.
---
&gt;We shouldn’t have to
---
This circles back to my initial assertion about people in your position being the minority. The majority are ready for the next section of content. Sorry that it isn’t convenient for you.
---
Here's a map guide https://www.fadedandblurred.com/wow-classic-dungeon-maps-for-tanks/
---
Had a 58 lvl tank in strat live then ud.He aced it
---
That's good advice, I've since respecced to arms so I've got one less cd to worry about. Spent most of yesterday getting add-ons and messing around with UI aswell. Very tedious but it's rewarding when it works :)
---
For settings, copy folder "WTF" and "Interface". For the addons, either copy the files, or install twitch.
---
I had a similar situation and it all transferred flawlessly.
---
reddit takes the bait for the 1000th time
---
Lol ok.
---
It is??
---
&gt; **Enha:** toss a coin, every time it lands on the edge, you win a jackpot. every time it lands on any side, you get brutally raped by a gang of gorillas. Choose how fun it is after a couple of tosses. 
---
lol true
---
And that's why I was thinking with my original comment, if at any given time this guy went over to his buddies house (or his buddy say brought a laptop over to his place), but he also directly said in game "I am going to do this to sabotage my friend" There is enough evidence against him.
---
nope
---
DPS is responsible for out-threating the tank, period.
---
If you don't have a threat meter, whisper someone who does and ask them when it's ok for you to start frostbolting.
---
You're just pulling this assertion out of your arse. You are underestimating the amount of casual players because you aren't interacting with them regularly.
---
You probably actually made yourself part of a community.
---
The one area of this game where "retail is that way" comments are justified are people who won't engage socially in the game but still expect a good experience. Talk to people. Add good players to your friends list. Hit them up later. Join a guild when you have a really nice run with their members. And so on. Retail has a "click button get dungeon never see them again" option and *that level* (not all) of the game is tuned so that a brain dead monkey can get through it no issue.  That isn't how classic works, you absolutely need to make friends with people.
---
If you join LFG, spam for what you want and get in the first group you find you will find yourself dealing with some of the more idiotic people in the game. I mean you can find great people there as well, but personally I found it much easier to build up some good relationships as I leveled, combined with my RL friends and finding a good guild? Every instance I run goes smoothly.
---
So don't skip as many packs when there's a lower level.
---
Lol ‘wow career’. Never heard someone call it that. Get a real job man. 
---
Here comes the defence comment 
---
“So many people call it wow career” 
---
Jesus lol
---
Come wait in an hour or longer queue if you want to play any time after about 5 PM EST and you're not already online.
---
You get good and bad players at all levels, I farmed this from 58-60 because the xp is really efficient and I had trouble with 60's pulling stuff or not understanding how the event works. Its a literal dice roll unless you run with guild.
---
ye my goal for vanilla is druid pvp as FC in WSG &amp; later ninja cap duo or flagkisser with AB jumps (+ twinks in premade gorup with twink guilds)
---
why? because those are my best memories connected to this game and I will once again wear this once i get the shoulders on r10

---
Yeah if you do this they aren't your friends
---
Yeah that was the main thing I thought was funny as to why I made the clip, not the sup par PvP ;) cheers dude!
---
Oh, you are just dumb. I thought you were actually admitting to trolling with your last comment. 
---
Don’t worry baby bird, ima walk you through the flow of this conversation. 
---
My first comment -&gt; your first reply -&gt; my comment making fun of the right tendencies of gaming communities yet their disdain for companies implementing those beliefs -&gt; your comment suggesting you don’t believe that way. 
---
I am not, nor am I accusing you of being, right leaning. How did you get so confused lol? Surly you’re not THAT dumb???
---
I agree. The stealth waking is hilarious. HOWEVER, the cringe part is shouting the attack names and nearly falling over as he spastically does the attack animations. And the fact that he’s trying not to laugh while shouting. If he did it like he was dead serious, it would’ve been much better.
---
No, it’s not. 2 hours is on point for a well geared coordinated group. For a pug you should expect an hour just to get there with 40 dudes, and likely 3-4 hours to clear if you include Rag. You’re going to wipe plenty of times, and each wipe will bring an ever increasing chance of the party disbanding. 
---
For context my guild clears MC in a little over 2 hours with no wipes with everyone fairly geared.
---
I also am considering making my alt on grobb it sounds amazing
---
Loading screen tip:
---
Enemy players whose names appear in grey are much lower level than you are and will not give honor when killed.
---
Bagnon does
---
Tmorph working? Intresting... might give it a shot. (:
---
There is no macro or addon that will let you do it in one click. That is not allowed. So you can build a macro for whatever skills you want it on that starts with '/dismount' or you can get an addon such as LetMeCast.
---
Either option you will have to click the skill/macro twice. Once to dismount, and once more to cast.
---
What? SS is nowhere close to this area..
---
The starting zones weren't that bad? It took an hour to complete levels 1 to 5.  Did you log in at release?
---
Roinky toinky
---
Sure, don’t rush the game but you’re underestimating how bad pvp is about to get for players leveling. Think STV on steroids in every shared zone.
---
That's me, my friends picked a PvP server so I had to as well. The PvP encounters that have been fair (1v1, 2v2, equal levels, etc) have been fun and exciting but being ganked and camped by skulls gets old quick. I had 2 skulls (rogue and a hunter) camp my corpse and kill a quest elite I needed to kill for about 30 mins, real great stuff.
---
Don’t do this to me...
---
No way....
---
I remember running ZF when I was leveling and every little mage thinking they can run past everything to Gy..... just couldn’t kill a few mobs and get there safe but rather die once or twice EVERYTIME getting over there.
---
90% of the time when y’all are going way to fast (tanks) it’s just wasting consumables on your healers.
---
Hmm... Just to turn it in?
---
I think it might be possible with Invis pots and some patience at level 60.
---
You basically do the lava skip, go past Incendius and you should be all good from there.
---
Can I offer you an egg in this trying time?
---
What do you mean authrlenticator?
---
sorry let me add a very important detail to my question. On an internet browser. You know how you can go to worldofwarcraft.com and look at all your characters? well it doesn't seem to apply to classic
---
I don't mind these. The worst is when they don't answer you at all, so you're left wondering if they found someone or are ignoring you for a different reason.
---
At a guess, PvP = more engineering items used = more mining required  
---
There's also people making PvP sets
---
You should be able to loot it just after cleansing it, after that it respawns every 25 min on the dot. If you stay there to farm it you shouldn’t need to recleanse as I farmed like 100.  I wanted enough for every set I’ll get without having to go farm it again.
---
Yes. To shareholders money over everything. To game designers and game players, that's not the case.
---
Although if I was a shareholder I'd just look at Blizzards basically 100% success rate and say "go ahead and do what you want".
---
Most of them do since they're probably running details damage meter. They probably don't have the tiny-threat window open, but at least they've got it :D
---
The population isn’t super high for alliance. Why do you think it’ll be bad?
---
If you would do a change i would rather it be removes entirwly which would solva all of your problems too
---
I love BGs and if I’m feeling frisky I’ll flag for pvp. I prefer pve servers because it’s my choice.
---
I am frostbolting as soon as I see tank pulling. If I crit I blame the healers.
---
Shut up.
---
I always saw it as the main bag icon, now my mind is blown.
---
It means that city raids will almost certainly be negative honor.
---
&gt;Overall I mean also include the argument you so naturally must have. Including all wipes amd frustration you believe you experienced from not fast enough lol
---
What the fuck kind of english is this? I can read all of these words but have no idea what the hell you're trying to say... did you have a stroke when you wrote that?
---
No they don’t. I work, right at this moment, for a public traded dev house, among other companies. One of our investors is one of the richest men on planet earth (I’m under an NDA and cannot say which) and the most ‘input’ we get from someone who gives us millions is “good job”. 
---
Rich people don’t do the work, they hire the people to do the work. I promise you the vanguard group, capital research and management co, geode capital — all of which are INVESTMENT FIRMS, aka investors pooling their money to invest — don’t have people on the ground making choices about development at activison dude. I swear the people on this forum are delusional.
---
Have you fought troll spriest tho? Shadowguard will melt you in no time and enjoy staying stunned
---
No.
---
You’re really underestimating just how many kills you need to rank up. Spending 20 minutes looking for a lvl 55 to kill is wildly a waste of your time.
---
As a frost mage, this is the first and only time ever in my life I will be referred to as 'cool'
---
Surely if I try really hard and grind out all the pre-BIS gear for my Paladin, someone will let me into their group.
---
Surely.
---
If you are playing classic for competetive raiding you should probably just go to retail.
---
Gathermate will work. You also will need a Gathermate data addon that comes with existing spawns and then you can filter herbalism to only show Lotus.
---
Did you go there right at 30?
---
I have never in 15 years used wow voice chat, and i never will and i dont know anyone who has or ever will. Just do what everyone is doing and use discord. Or even battle.net
---
They are enjoying the game the way they want. If that ruins someoned day then it's on them. Why is it that only one group gets to dictate what's fun in this game? If you rolled pvp server this is what you signed up for.
---
If PvE is your main focus, you should not be 30/0/21 unless you’re willing to respec for raids. Mana tide and deep resto are amazing for raids and necessary if you want to get the full benefit of shamans T1 set bonus. I would not be giving T1 to an ele/resto shaman over a deep resto trying to build 8/8 T1. 
---
Ele/resto is just passable for PvE with twisting and using consumes. Amazing for PvP, but if you’re just using it for the occasional world PvP I think you would be better off healing in PvP as resto with a group when you want to. You’ll be much more valuable to your main focus of PvE as deep resto.
---

Class leaders discuss opening in discord about who it should go to, if anyone that is not a class leader has any input or concerns they can say so and it will be considered and chatted about by leaders. They usually base their decisions off of who has received loot recently, who has attended the most, has anyone gone above and beyond for the raid, etc.
---
3 weeks of full clearing MC/Ony and no issues/drama so far.
---
This was my first thought as well.
---
Or send them to your alts and then return them since you’ll have a 30 day timer to collect.

My fiance and friends all know I'm not doing shit till I'm 60 and geared, I told them the classic relaunch will happen once in my life, I have my whole life to spend time with then

Honestly I loved STV on a PvP server, it reminded me of the reason WoW was so great in the first place. All the random lowbie PvP, how newbs group up together to take down someone 10+ levels above them, getting jumped on and starting grudges all made it feel like real interaction instead of just cycling through the same actions in BG's with people you'll never see again.
---
Yes. I did the first tiger / panther quests at 30 and then came back at 33 to do the rest of the hunting quests a well as the troll killing quests.
---
only two tanks in the whole guild?
---
They’re assuming you’ll revive at your body.
---
CLEAR COMMS
---
Am here I am not surprised at all... It is 2019 after all
---
I'm saying it matters because if you're too level you pull an insane amount of mobs due to your level. You can definitely do a lot of stuff while underleveled, but ultimately it is something that needs to be played around heavily, and finding an appropriately leveled healer barely takes any time at all. Also in this instance these people don't know each other, most people I know would never take with them a low level random just because he insists he is a good player or w/e.
---
imagine caring about somones UI
---
I only got ganked once (started at about 32)
---
though I did always play after midnight
---
I've read so much bad info on wowhead about doing this. Because I've read everything from "you can't, period", "read this book", "do this quest". They must have changed how you do it multiple times.
---
&gt; You're fighting against your allies instead of working with them. Communication is key, [...]
---
How am I supposed to work with my allies? There's a piece of loot I want, and they want it as well. Nobody is backing down, everybody is thinking that they deserve it the most.
---
Because other 60s will be in the same zone you’re in, looking for lower levels to kill, and will happily kill you when you open on a lvl 55?
---
Yesh I feel like most exaggerate the pvp there mostly because it's ine of the first zones where horde and alliance truly clash together. I've never had too much issues really. Multiple deaths in pvp for sure, but nothing crazy like getting corpsecamped for hours.
---
Is it good? Was thinking of getting it! Love Epyon and Tallgeese have them both in battle pose hanging from fishing line lol 
---
Damn lol The luck!!!
---
You literally contradicted yourself in your own post. That's funny as fuck.
---
I do know what I'm talking about because 1.12 is literally the SAME VERSION WE PLAY ON TODAY IN RETAIL. The only difference is they have a 'death limit' and we wont. But the same idea will happen, it makes more sense to ignore each other and rush. 
---
AV will be a joke of a BG only useful for whichever faction has a higher win% and the other will just not que.
---
Flad you wrote that. Been difficult for me to articulate the same ideas
---
The only person losing their mind in this thread is you. You're willfully and proudly ignorant. Play the game however you want, but that doesn't change the fact that having a mount provides you better and faster access and progression in all aspects of the game. If you like pvp, mounts get you to your destination to pvp. If you like dungeons, mounts get you to the dungeons. If you like farming, mounts get you to the nodes. If you like crafting, mounts get you to the widespread vendors and trainers for your recipes. The level 40+ zones were designed with mounts in mind, with wide stretches of nothing and huge distances between nodes, mobs and the beginning and end of quests.
---
Everything is better and faster with a mount. You're only hurting yourself by not having one. 
---
That's fine, hurt your self all you want; by definition, it's not hurting me.
---
You have a victim complex and some jacked up elitist attitude about being a casual, though.

You're spreading misinformation. There is no "bug" here. I literally just told you what triggers it. Learn to read.
---
Usually the tank is the one reserving things
---
You can't do this.  Even the addon that people are telling you to get acts the same way.  Dismounting starts a global which ends your macro.  Letmecast, a popular addon that will make you dismount or stand up so you can cast, also needs to hit your spells twice because of the global, the first time it will just dismount you without casting the spell you tried.  The same way that you need to hit your macro twice.  If you don't want an addon just keep that dismount in all of your macros that you might try while mounted.  You will always need to hit it a second time whether it's with a macro or with the addon.  Hope that helps clear it up.
---
Need to go to Badlands and camp out for Broken Tooth. YouTube where it spawns.
---
‘Shut yo’ hahahaha glad your career is wow and not comebacks

I’d delete my comment too haha

Better go back to work kid

At least finish all quest in Stranglethorn Vale.

"You put more effort into the game then me and was rewarded for it. That must mean you're a cheater"
---
First time I pugged Ony we wiped like 7 times because the mages could not stop dpsing going into phase 3 and getting half the raid wiped.
---
What was the point of this?
---
Some laptops have a power-saving option. When it enters that state it dramatically effects your FPS. I had a similar issue on my ROG laptop. After going into the power options and disabling the power saving settings it stopped. Might be worth having a look at.
---
Seems like mostly PVE players who are crying about phase 2 and how bad it would be on a PVP server.
---
It never takes me more than 2-3 minutes to find a group for any content.
---
I’m a holy priest and my buddy is a prot warrior. Works pretty nice.
---
Holy shit dude, I was explaining why I posted what I did.
---
I felt like the smartest motherfucker on Azeroth when I found this for the first time on my classic play through.
---
Just level up
---
Pads of the Dread Wolf DO have more Stam.. they have 14 stam and Swiftwalker has 7
---
I only got rank 11 with complete no lifing and pretty good BG group. GL with rank 14 for those considering.
---
I guess the poster was thinking in the context of adventure game that he thought spoilers ruined the fun for him.
---
With that said tho, I agree with everyone here, it’s a stretch to have a completely in the dark kind of experience going into a game these days, let alone the most popular mmorpg that we are talking about here, so I’m not really sure what anyone can do to avoid this lol
---
OK.
---
You can also just add them into the mix with chorush and the boss, just keep serpent stings on them and they die
---
That's weird, mine's a carrot.
---
Worldbuilding is more than just great looking zones, it's also quests fitting a character which has saved the world of azeroth on several occasions - the shadowlands had best be a place that absolutely destroys players, with stupidly powerful mobs that aren't meant to be faced by mortals.
---
At least there's some extra special penalty for dying, so lets hope they really try and kill the player this time around.
---
You're welcome! First time I saw a classic city raid, was fun to watch :D
---
Uhh I mean... sure &gt;\_&gt; \^\^filthy \^\^horde \^\^scum
---
My experience with STV was relative to what came before. It was the first zone I leveled in that both factions were in large quantities and that there is a wide range of levels. As the low pop faction I got killed countless times by skull horde just camping Nestingways camp.
---
If I had the time again sure. You need a tight group to go far. I lost 30 pounds and started losing my hair. Playing 18 hour days for 3 months.  You sleep during long queues and will almost fail out of class. No time for friends , S/O.  Did I mention needing to farm gold at the same time for respects, flasks, pots etc? I met some great people during the grind. I still talk to two of them. Just remember when you log off and go outside you are no longer a Grand Marshal. Yes I still rock the the title in retail.
---
Do not binge on energy drinks and shit food . It's a marathon.
---
I'm on a high pop server and was leveling with the pack when I hit STV. 
---
On a 65/35 server.
---
On the 35 side. 
---
I fucked so many horde. And got fucked by so many horde.
---
It was Vietnam. and i loved it.
---
Thanks for the input. I do realize that part of the problem is that I can’t adapt to certain difficulties that these situations present. Letting a mob attack a dps is soemthing I have a hard time doing but now I’ll be mindful of it. 
---
Healer is always my first priority and one of my best friends is a priest who I play with a lot so that’s kinda just second nature. 
---
As far as gear goes, I’ve been focusing on Stamina and Strength pretty much since the start. Right now my stats are 212(+111) strength, 103(+43) agility, 205(+115) stamina, 23int, 63(+22) spirit and 5080 armor with shield, 3185 without. Lvl49. Is that about what I should be going for? I’m planning on going prot spec once I get closer to 60 but I feel like it wouldn’t have helped much up to this point t. I have points in fury and arms. Just to be clear though my problem isn’t that I have a hard time surviving. I just feel like everything is chaos with some groups
---
Catch me if you can, don’t waste your bubble!
---
Looks like someone doesn't know the difference between offline and empty.
---
I had opposite experience playing alliance on my server. 
---
I was able to do the kurzon compound quests at top right of map. Pretty much every other quest was constant ganks. 
---
Worst area by far I found was the small group of npc you talk to at camp in top left above for tiger/panther quest and the collect pages quest. 
---
There would be a group of horde players waiting to kill me every time I approached that camp pretty much irregardless of time of day.  
---
It became like a mini game to run up to npc spam click them to try to turn in quest before you died.
---
I found it much easier to do quests in Desolace and badlands.
---
Yeah I don't know, I kind of dislike Suc. I levelled 100% with void and will probably use either void or felhound in BGs.
---
8.6 pushes it it off the table but not possible to get so becomes 9% goal, 8% is forgivable
---
I love this meme format lol
---
It doesn't change the fact that ~1.1k upvotes seem to disagree with your view. You say it "doesn't add anything" but then based on that, what would satisfy your "add anything", then?
---
Min-maxing? That's all Google-able.
---
Concerns with the game? You'll say oh that's just emotional, no place for that here.
---
You have to realize that people get satisfaction and agree with certain themes. To you oh that's karma-whoring but I see it as a nice way of countering all the people here who insist most tanks are bad, most people play this game bad, and all the people here who hit 60 in 4 days /played and claim oh they're just casual.
---
cry more bruh
---
Wrong time to respec in my opinion. You get Ravager Axe at 37 and dungeon runs can be very fun with it. Ran a few 3 warrior, priest and shaman ZF farms with it. I respecd at lvl 52 when I started healing BRD and eventually other instances for my pre-bis.
---
Of course he’s a ffxiv player LMFAO
---
This new generation of MMO players are ridiculous, I would rather play on a server filled with toxic shitheads that sweat to the fullest and camp every FP versus playing with a bunch of carebears on a PVE server.
---
Do I think investors are asking Blizzard to buff Rogue's by 3.7% or add more cleave damage to Druids? No. But do I believe investors are actively driving game design decision based on metrics? Yes.
---
Listen to a BlizzardActivision investor call, specifically when they move into the Q&amp;A section as well as their slide shows.
---
It's all about MAUs (Monthly Active Users) and DAUs (Daily Active Users) that's why WoD, Legion and BfA have so many hated design decisions, particularly BfA. It's why WoD was likened to a Facebook game. Why Legion and BfA had phone games and world quests that changed every few hours and why all future WoW-expansions will have endless or near endless grinds to them. From Warforge and Titanforge to Artifact, Azerite, and Anima. It's why they still are not developing new baseline aspects to classes and why any new class design is done as a "rent-a-feature" as part of an expac that will die in the next expac. From Artifacts to Azerite-whatever to Anima and Covenants.
---
Working towards these things in bits and pieces through completing world quests thousands of times over the course of an expansion.
---
It's why every patch in BfA they just kept moving the goalposts a little further down the line. It's why they don't have tier gear, because if you "finish" 4 slots of your gear those are 4 less slots that can be filled by whatever MAU/DAU driven feature an expansion has.
---
Rings don't show

Right now epics de into large brilliants, so it's a very low bar

Killing someone near your level will give your honor, at the end of a week you get a new rank if you have enough honor points. Killing NPC civilians will give dishonorable kills that significantly hurt your honor.

Depending on your rank, you can acquire new gear from the quartermasters.

God bless you guys, I am so tired of undeads.

Yeah they should definitely fix this.

Actually that is how it works.  The activated ability has a level req that is not displayed on the item even though it is equipable for the stam bonus (which is still a really nice bonus for a twink).

---
Not a big deal, you will never use immolate in raid, and seeing as you stack alot more shadow damage than overall spell damage its often not worth the mana over a shadowbolt
---
Rank one seal of command is good if you're very low on mana or just questing and care about reducing downtime rather than maximizing dps.
---
The downside is that your judgement damage is significantly reduced (proc damage is not however).
---
As a tank, I know the feeling.  Thankfully, I've run BRD and a couple other dungeons enough that I know MOST of the patrols and timing with some of the basic paths/runs.  I also find it helpful as a Fury/Prot build to range pull and LoS packs sometimes to give myself the 'buffer' range for patrols and runners, thankfully if Bloodrage is on cooldown I can still generally build enough rage for a sunder pretty quickly.
---
I just try to have patience with people and nicely chastise them like a kid with their hand in a cookie jar if/when they mess up.  If they are apologetic and slow down or learn they go on my friend list, if they are assholes or refuse to listen then they get ignored.
---
I would rather spend 3 hours patiently teaching someone the packs that need to be pulled and the lines that they can walk to bypass stuff, then I would 2 hours in a constant fit trying to corral 4 extra mobs every pull because someone wasn't watching where they were standing and body-pulled an unnecessary pack.
---
These bad players also wouldn't have rolled on an alliance dominated server, they rely on being able to outnumber to win.
---
Yes i logged in at midnight. Sure it was bad but the mobs respawn a lot quicker and there are a lot more of them everywhere. Like boars in the orc starting zone are pretty much everywhere and respawn quick. The only thing that i thought was bad for me at release was named mobs in the barrens where there were a ton of groups competing for a tag. Cant really camplain about anything before the barrens. I play tauren though so i was naturally gonna have it easier than any other horde race. In later zones quest mobs are less abundant, have longer respawn timers and sometimes they even share spawns with other creatures. Forcing you to kill creatures you dont need just for a chance of them respawning. Ever had to kill wolfes i think in easter plaguelands? But there arent any because players killed them for quests and they share a respawn with spiders which are not required for any quests so all the spawn locations are essentially spiders after the first dozen players went through them. Just an example, that one isnt that bad because at least the respawns are abundant even though they share a spawn and you most likely will have to wipe 80% of the spiders all over the place till you get enough wolves to spawn.
---
Safe spotting is not bannable. Only if you're on a roof. Attacking someone because your los/too far from the guards to see you is not bannable.
---
You're a pretty predictable guy, see I knew you'd go in this direction, calling me bad. It seemed nearly inevitable, with your thinking.
---
I've tanked many a run and am inudated with whispers daily on "can you tank X instance/UBRS" etc etc. I'm sure if I was as bad a tank as you seem to say I am, then oh I guess incompetence attracts other incompetence right? What fun it is to wipe over and over unless the group finally disbands?
---
I'll have you know that you know what? I'm not a go-go-go tank who loves to rush into packs before the healer's had a chance to catch their breath regen even a sliver of mana. My preferred style is the "steady and get the job done" but guys like you think oh 5 minutes longer than it needs to be? BAD TANK GTFO.
---
Good. I'll stay off your friends list, all the better for both of us. I won't meet your standard of the 0.1% upper echelons of god tanks who are on sponsored guilds and I don't care to be. I'm just the guy who plays the game the way I want to play it, and clearly many enjoy my approach.
---
How much mana are you expending when you kill mobs?  Are you using all your abilities on them?  The beauty of BM leveling is the low downtime, you shouldn't have to drink ever.   You don't need broken tooth, he doesn't do more damage he only attacks fast.  Are you leveling an alt using the best BoE weapons you can get?
---
Ah yes, the only two options available.
---
Lets ignore everything else and focus only on these two so we can push our own narratives.
---
\#nochanges
---
Private servers never saw the volume u are seeing in wow classic. Plus they were full of bugs and inconsistencies with actual retail vanilla. Yes, they were the catalyst to get wow classic, but they were never destined to bring in the numbers you are seeing for classic. You are god damn delusional and so far out of touch with realistic numbers lol. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS?! Never was going to happen, and to round full circle, layering probably had no significant effect on the current player base. 
---
So naive.
---
There’s a +55 healing to 2hs?

Dunno what uterus-es you've been looking at lol

Account got locked because im accessing from another country and I cant log in :( its been 6 hours already. My grind is suffering

Stormwind syndrome
---
Nope. Back in vanilla it worked.
---
You are an Idiot because this already wasnt allowed in VANILLA as proven by blueposts from the time. Im sure your smart ass can find it so go ahead.
---
No one wins a free-for-all. The winner of the arena chest is pretty much always someone who had the presence of mind to form a party.
---
I went more with the 29 range. Zealot blades, butcher blades, vendetta, are all inexpensive and will spike pretty heavily. Got a couple staff or Jordans under 100g too.  Try looking for some Twisted Chanters staffs or actual BiS weapons that will skyrocket. Don’t mess with shadow fang or A blade they are already steep in price on most servers.
---
Depends if you get a crystal or not usually
---
It varies, but in general about 24~ hours from a lot of the responses I've seen.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
This was how it was in vanilla though. It was in the game but it wasnt allowed
---
Can’t wait to stick a Gnomish Battle Chicken on my ear.
---
So, a duck?
---
Why reserve names no one else wants?
---
as a 60 i tanked brd with a 49 pally.

basically just stick to the wall and pull the groups to the edges.
---
I’m still asking my mum to pay the subscription fee

Best time
---
You are correct. I don't know what a female dragon's reproductive organs look like.
---
Broken tooth doesnt do more damage than other pets. In fact it probably does less than a wind serpent for instance because the wind serpents ability ignores armor. I might be wrong though. Base dps is the same across all pets tho.
---
I had Ravager axe, still wasn't worth that pain. I specifically waited one level so I could test it out. Wasn't impressed.
---
Himself.
---
Aww this was so well said!
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Thought it looked like a penis with the sac kicked backwards and up.
---
I'm impressed you managed to scrape together 40 people to raid mc on a dead server
---
No honor, no BG's, one faceroll raid.  Parsing is literally the only way to compete in the game at all atm.
---
Honestly, don't read this subreddit for an accurate representation of the state of the game. It's the nature of all subreddits to become extreme versions of both positivity and negativity.
---
If you only read this sub and didn't play the game, you'd think the game was pretty much over and all the raids had been cleared by everyone already. In reality, the large minority of players have cleared MC even once.
---
You literally quoted me saying, “Idk if you do but you might” as proof.....outstanding.
---
Awesome thanks ill see if i can start grabbing some on my server
---
Yeah but your setting up a straw-man argument.   My argument wasn't Hunters are THE HIGHEST DPS.
---
Nah Horde win in out numbered fights. Even fights are 50/50 even sightly Ally favored because Pallys can bubble and spam heal.
---
....it was fixed... it was in the game but wasnt allowed not because they wanted it that way or they intended fornit to be programmed that way but because that was the only solution they could come up with at the time.
---
So that means we should time gate all solutions to all major glitches? And allow all major glitches to be abused and the solution should be to ban them until the solution is released? 
---
That has to be the craziest and dumbest solution to a problem I've ever seen.
---
This bug has to stay in the game so that we could get abusing trash players out of the game via banning them. If you can’t resist the desire to climb there and start shooting at the enemy players it means you are fine with shitting on other players even using the obvious 15-year-old bugs, which means the community will not lose anything by losing you.
---
\[you have been removed from group\]
---
I'm a priest and I always get proactively buffed by druids and pallies.
---
Mages rarely, even if I buff them first.  (i know reddit mages are buff buddies)
---
Any wand you can suggest?
---
There is little logic in your premise.  No game is perfect...therefore demanding perfection is illogical.
---
Your guild must be very organized to have a good loot council. Certain classes/specs won’t parse as well as others, but are still valuable to the raid and typically hurt their parse to bring that certain niche your guild wants. 
---
Raid attendance should certainly be looked at. Do you want a day 1 lvl 60 who you never raided with getting an amazing piece of gear? Or a player has stuck with you for months and shows a commitment to the guild?
---
Logs tell you a lot on player performance. If examined closely you can tell if a player is just trying to pad their stats or performing well and following the raid strategy. Logs can also tell you who is consuming and putting forth the most effort. 
---
Loot council should never be a popularity vote, and it’s very easy for that to happen. There needs to be trust and reputation within the guild to not do this. Is the guild brand new formed by a few friends hoping for some free loot? Or is this a guild from retail or private servers with a proven track record of rewarding worthy players?
---
Loot council is certainly not for everyone. And should absolutely never be considered in a new guild or Pug. But if you plan to stick with the guild, and perform well, you will certainly be rewarded for your time in a proper loot council.
---
To be fair, I know your comment is not meant to be read literally, but a dozen runs, twelve, is only slightly above the droprate, which is about 10 %.
---
That’s probably why I thought that. I played runescape before as well.
---
Your grammar triggers me.
---
I see two people commenting on this post: the veterans that say playing a mage is hard and the people leveling alts that say it easy. I don't get it
---
Based on the replies here, was I the only one that knew this was an earring? Like, what did you guys see before?
---
because they have heads anwyays? might as well use them to clear a bit faster.
---
uhh...warrior - gnome?
---
It's just for stam lol
---
Ravager enhance still feels like garbage compared to swapping to ele at that point.
---
I was well geared dungeon loot wise at ~40. Struggled killing 1 yellow mob in badlands. Swapped to ele and put on my int stacking healing set, could comfortably get jumped by 2 mobs and kill them both.
---
Enhance is hot trash at pve.
---
*Yawn*
---
You done?
---
Just tried again and it works, so this got solved in under 6 hours :D
---
The solution is not to abuse it in the first place. Blizzard wont ban you just like that for doing that. A GM will message you explaining that it is not allowed and you should stop As evidenced by many posts here on this sub. If after that you keep doing that even though you were warned then its your fucking problem and you should face the consequences
---
Well past SM now but thank you, I’ll have try when my alt gets to running there
---
Which I just realized will put his scrawny ass in gank city in about a week lmao
---
Again, you’re way over estimating the level of input, 
---
Do I doubt they question figures like users and screen time? No.
---
Are they giving tips on how to achieve them? Definitely no
---
Come to my server. You will know what "wasting time" really means.
---
The best way to remove abusing players is by allowing them to abuse glitches? 
---
Lol wut? Or maybe just remove the thing they can abuse because i dunno if your a human but we tend to abuse things regardless if it's illegal or against the rules, so really your solution doesnt solve the problem.
---
It's like stop criminals by making it easier for them to break the laws, who is winning at the end of the day? Certainly not the people playing the game or the general public.
---
I specced pvp ele resto spec at 44. Healed perfectly fine like that till 60. Quested with ease in said spec. I would swap EM for NS as it’s a god send when healing. 
---
I only changed to deep resto once I had my epic mount farmed and was maybe 2 weeks into raiding. 
---
Now I don’t have any big gold grind to do.
---
Even raiding you don’t need deep resto if you’re raid healing. Just have mama pots on you. Respect once you’ve farmed all the big gold grinds that you need. 
---
If your guild is serious. You’ll need to be deep resto though. At least until everyone gets semi geared.
---
I leveled a warrior to 60 first now I'm working on my hunter alt (because farming gold as a warrior can suck my ass) and nothing pisses me off more than a warrior spamming for a tank. It's not like tanking is hard anyway, just taunt shit off the healer and let the DPS figure it out.
---
when you kill a noob dont teabag corpse wastes a good 5 - 6 seconds
---
Lmao this one got me
---
Devilsaur leather, after peak hours you can get a lot of it in a short time, you can earn 100g/hour if you don't mind the grind.
---
Got me my epic mount in a week!
---
This is on a layered PvE realm though so it's a bit easier to get.
---
Only two that spend all day on off-raid days running people through dungeons they don't need.
---
Lolwut?
---
There's an addon called Atlas that will let you see maps for dungeons in game.  Just the pictures though, it won't actually show your icon the map.  It's nice for most dungeons but it can be kinda hard on multi level dungeons like The Sunken Temple and Black Rock Depths.
---
The trick to holy reckoning is switching as needed between a good proc effect two hander and your healing 1H/Shield. When you need to put some damage out you can use a 2H like the Doomsaw from UBRS with a fiery enchant, and when you need to heal switch back to your 1H. Reck Stacks don’t store when you switch weapons though, so have to get used to situationally switching. 1H reckoning is possible too, just would want to find a 1H with a proc.
---
I think you can use it on both 1hs and 2hs but i might be wrong
---
60 Warr (Open to Tank or Fury)
---
LF Guild on Kromcrush that needs warriors
---
Stop
---
Depends on ur class but dal rend and mirah song are the best 1h weapons pre raid.
---
I'll let you think what you will. I wanted to express this common opinion I had from people migrating to PvE servers and realistically, I spoke more as a common voice, even myself who isn't really a PvP sort of player am just thinking of just powering through it or migrating if it becomes unenjoyable (or taking a break until Phase 3 if you will). It will however irritate me, I'll be honest. Who knows, maybe I'll be a good PvPer.
---
Getting out of the barrens on launch was the breakthrough. The rest was coasting in instanced and select quests.
---
Wyvern Sting is a poison, can't be used in combat, and is affected by deadzone. 
---
Felhunter dispell has CD which means you can bait it out or cancel by overlapping CC. 
---
Warrior will get rooted by nova the moment he charges in.
---
Out of all the classes, rogue, mage, and hpala have the best pvp potential (in vanilla), especially in a 3v3 scenario in tight areas
---
In for the answer, too.
---
This and every other dungeon thats farmable from 48-60. Which is every dungeon, pretty much.
---
Nah. We just selectively invite only casters.
---
so if i went 9/10 in MC with my guild last night.  can i join this other guild that is on Rag tonight?  or am i locked to my other raid group
---
Devilsaur leather, got my epic mount funds in a week. I didn't even grind all that much!
---
You're right.  Logs don't lie.  Hunter's median at 46.5,  Rogues at 50,  Compare that to Warlocks who have a good kit, but not as good as Hunter's can't solo DM Tribute, are at 37.6.   Considering all the Perks of being a Hunter, like Solo'ing close to even level elites, Solo'ing shit that NOBODY else can solo,  they are very near the top end DPS.      
---
   
---
You can't deny, Blizzard LOVES hunters more than any other class.
---
Ya, I just leave when I join a group that's got a 56 trying to do one of the end game dungeons. I tank about every group I do. Not dealing with carrying someone for no reason.
---
Broadly true, but very context specific. DPS pulling aggro 5 seconds in? Clearly DPS problem. Rogue/Hunter pulling threat 1 min in? Also probably DPS problem. Frostmage pulling threat 3 mins into tank &amp; spank? Definitely a tank issue.
---
well played lol
---
Why did you use your bought gold to buy 2 300g+ swords instead of 350g for dalrends mh run
---
Lol even when they do come it’s a fight you’ll never win. If you come with 3 people for example the lowbies will report and 5 alliance will come. It’s harder for reinforcements horde to come
---
Hey man. Thank you. Thank you so much. You are right.
---
Or you could actually bother to see it as something worth thinking about. Its an opinion, I shouldn't have to make a min-max guide to impress you. Maybe noobs don't like getting permastunned. I don't wanna have to skill engineering to be able to eat in WoW.
---
Poop sock
---
no
---
Definitely not a bug
---
Pala cleanse = best dispell ingame, best heal efficiency, best armor snd resistances, high burst dmg potential with holy / reck build (skips holy shock)
---
Mages = the best pvp class in the game, infinite slow duration, no cd spammable CC
---
Rogue= stealth (not first focus target untill you pop out), double CDs if specced right, high burst potential, the class with the most amount of CC in the game.
---
Hold in there, I did the same as you and finally got my bag and gloves on the same visit. Only took a month of having my level 2 check in there every morning at 5AM.
---
Set bonus is 2% crit chance, which doesn’t really help shadow much

Yes! I did this too!

that sounds like a fun time :)) now to find spots on my action bars for low rank blessings XD
---
It’s not homophobic. We supported him. Lol
---
No, not at all. I'm sitting reading everything.
---
What do I do with my pet as a newb hunter in dungeons? I feel like he's gonna agro everything. Should I just dismiss him?
---
It's not about pulling aggro, its about letting the tanks get enough aggro to make the transition from P2 to P3 easier.  That's why you want a longer phase 1.
---
I've had that bug with Night Dragons, too. Luckily it hasn't happened to me in weeks.
---
In this case it has to be for...
---
/stupidfuckingbrokenpieceofshitrandomgeneratedfucksalt
---
Honestly the freaking out happens alot on reddit... but in game most people that are still levelling don’t care too much, they were always gonna play at their own pace anyway
---
Same, I went there for mooncloth and the bag pattern was there as well. That was very early on though, before more people were high enough level.
---
Chromie? She's upstairs in a building in the western plague lands. In the north west of the zombie filled town. 
---
She's actually a time warping dragon but likes to take gnome form.
---
I think this will sort of make it far more accessible (by use of force) to group up as 5 and go do dungeon runs because questing and getting camped won't be as much fun. Plus, personally I'm planning on doing just that for a while now regardless of P2.
---
Mind blown
---
That's quite an impressive amount of sub money. I wonder what their setup is like too, they can't all be running on the same machine.
---
As long as you get to kill them if they attack you idgaf.
---
2x dal'rends its superior to dr mh + mirah's. If you manage to farm the mh, just farm the offhand too.
---
Than*
---
the raw dps from Verdant Keeper's Aim will last him til 60, free from a quest without costing him however much gold for a bad world epic.
---
The world epic that lasts him an entire 3 levels before he gets aimed shot btw. Yeah no, Hurricane is trash.
---
how much mana does a purge cost? the database seems to say 10% of base mana but i doubt that is correct
---
It was confusing to me, too, when I first started Mara farm, but that's just how Rotgrips aggro works. The "faction" explanation makes sense to me, he's only allied with the mobs in the water.
---
If people in your position were in the majority, phases would be released closer to the time table you want. But alas, it’s not. What do you think the explanation is?
---
Can someone eli5 the ranking system?
---
they would just dispell the freedom
---
By the time it matters you'll have hardly noticed a thing. Don't worry is the whole point.
---
It's not worth thinking about because I don't care about your opinion. Just like your post is trying to get casual players to not care about the opinion of hardcore players, I don't care about yours. 
---
Am I casual?
---
Am I hardcore? 
---
Who knows and who cares?
---
Look at your own post as a response to mine. It doesn't even make sense -- I'm not asking you to make a min-max guide. I didn't mention anything about being permastunned. I didn't mention engineering and I didn't mention eating. You're just ranting at the boogeyman, bud.

BM pets in vanilla never did more damage than the hunter, and I'm honestly not sure why so many people think they did.
---
Being competitive is the only fun you can have? Then move on to something else. What's fair? Randomness that everyone has to face is fair.
---
It's so fun to mess around with and surprise people if you get it early. Unfortunately it falls off a lot at higher levels when you can't instantly blow someone up.
---
I would say that he’s exaggerating, it’s something like 3 hours by the time people gather up etc. On the first 2 raids my guild did till domo on 1 day and rag+onyxia on another day
---
As a rogue i don’t really have this kind of trouble finding a group. Assuming its not during a quiet time, i can usually find one within 15 minutes. Maybe you’re on a low pop server?
---
I'm in the same position as you. I dropped 2 from improved lay on hand and 3 from concentration aura and got 5/5 Improved Seal of Righteousness. Also was using Blessing of wisdom instead of improved judge. 
---
I think it come down to gear mostly. I've gotten to the point where my gear is good enough that I can afford to lose some damage mitigation and still tank fine.
---
Holy Shock + Divine favor on pull will really help with single target fights and also Blessing of wisdom / blessing of kings are great depending on the fight. I totally think you can tank with this build, because I'm going to!
---
Good luck!
---
it resets if you put an item in first
---
Retribution is like heroin. We all know its bad for us, bad for our friends, guild, family but we still do it anyway.
---
If you get into the bracket 1 premade, you'll notice that good players aren't reliant upon some arbitrary rating tied to an unecessary matchmaking. No rating = you get to meet new people and play with new people becaude you can't measure dick sizes by looking at your numbers. Rating is also terrible for an rpg
---
please stop advertising azshara.
---
Rolled on pve, ain't got no problems problems
---
I feel bad reading the rest of these comments. I have them, but they're in my bag because I'm way over hitcap. I've somehow managed to get every piece of pre-bis hit gear in exactly the wrong order, and have nothing to replace them with. Therefore I'm wearing valor shoulders and Truestrike are banked.
---
When people think they’re smart but they aren’t
---
You wanted vanilla PvP, that's it. Server balance has been an issue since release back in 04, that's what sharding was supposed (but failed) to fix.
---
Which has no benefit over critting less often but the fewer crits dealing more damage each time.
---
look into being poor for the rest of that poor warrior's life if he crutches on fap every fight.
---
Everyone's experience is different. It was only bad for me a couple of times, but those times were so bad that I just logged off. I have no reason to keep respawning through a res timer when there is a 60 camping me.
---
I did demonslaying for easier Rhok'Delar and also the glow, the glow baby!!
---
Hilarious, great work
---
Lmao I always undercut. Otherwise my shit doesn’t sell.
---
Why would you reserve names that you didn’t want just because somebody else wants it?
---
I didn't farm gold and had 600g.
---
I was there earlier today.  Saw a horde that was 5 lvls up on me, one that had also left me alone in the area, get wrecked by a 60 paladin.  When he resurrected I /sorry his way...at that exact moment a 60 rogue cheapshotted me and I blocked.  The horde warrior from before /no to the guy and he waved at me and spared me.  Most of the time if you aren’t being a dick..people will just level.  But being on a horde biased server I knew it was in my best interest to apologize to the warrior that had been nice enough to just let me level in peace.   
---
TLDR; wasn’t a dick, didn’t get camped by a rogue for half an hour
---
I had the exact same problem on a Mac.
---
Pointless
---
„... obviously“
---
The poison isnt applied until after the sleep effect, so you scatter shot FD into WS. Felhunter dispel does have a cd but mage without frost shield or removing the nova from the warrior is giving the mage a hard time regardless.  
---
I dont know why you rank paladin so highly in vanilla pvp like especially in this hypothetical arena scenario. Theres a reason rmp was a staple for such a long time.
---
Holy fucking shit
---
Will it also sync the add on settings or will the new laptop installation have only the original default settings? Will the UI look the same as the original PC?
---
Eg I have downloaded a bunch of various twitch addons but only have some of them enabled on some characters, and I have spent time tweaking others. Would all those configurations also transfer?
---
"Happily"
---
I don't know what server you play on, but all of my experiences have been people ignoring any cry for help. Most people even flame you when you complain about someone camping a roof or somewhere in Tararnis. "You rolled on a pvp server, stop crying"
---
I tanked strat live as a 57 warrior. The group originally turned me away but messaged me 30 mins later when they couldn’t find anyone else. I think we wiped once.
---
You're a legend and I thank you kindly for helping me on my quest. I would've never gotten through it for a bit without you. 
---
Thanks for everything
---
Ah, I remember grinding AV rep to exalted back in the day for the mount. It wasn't really cheap, but I think it was like 200g cheaper than the normal epic mount, or something. Plus the horde one looks fuckin dope.
---
should be just the same as the warchiefs blessing, 1hr cd
---
Thanks that makes a lot more sense now!
---
Doesnt that make it super difficult for new players though later on?
---
Not everyone started day 1. Why cater to only thr people who have played longer?
---
Thank god not as much as the natural thorns some fucking mobs have jesus christ.
---
Some of the gear was good through Karazhan and some trinkets were good past that. 
---
Some quest trinkets in Classic can't be replaced until Naxx.  
---
Blizzard was pretty bad about trinkets through most of WoW. There was a best-in-slot for all melees trinket that dropped from Gruul; nothing in TBC surpassed that trinket from the first raid tier for the entire expansion.
---
They did the same exact thing with a trinket in WotLK, but at least that was in ICC  the 2nd to last raid of the expansion.
---
I gauge the group I'm with honestly. If the tank and healer is responsive and doesn't tunnel vision, then I will wait my 3 sec and AE spam, knowing I will pull aggro and the healer will swap to healing me or the other mage.  If I am the tank with my healer friend then we tell them ahead of time what we want and tailor or plan after a few pulls. However we always push for fast runs, and yeah sometimes we get in where we are doing slow pulls, but usually that ends after we are done with the dungeon.
---
Domination.
---
Please do research before you start acting like you know everything kiddo.
---
Was doing Warrior quest in Charred Vale as a Dwarf.  Rando Horde Warlock walks up as I accidentally pull 3 mobs, I had popped retaliation, just as I'm killing the last mob I see the hordes DoT animations go off, thought he was trying to finish me off so I charged him and killed him too.  He was helping me kill the mobs that were on me and I just didnt noticed the dots, but there definitely were not any on me.
---
6hrs
---
48-59 you say?
---
Crap I'm 48
---
How can I learn to weigh the difference between +healing to spells or +magical effects vs that of intellect? Is there a strict formula I can pin and work it out mathematically or should I just kinda "feel" it out until I can be certain of the pieces I need to be aiming for? I realise I should consider the mana gained as well but I want to leave that aside for the moment.
---
Playing healing priest if that is relevant.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;  blind the lip and reset afterwards.
---
Just be a shaman.
---
Gotta be the nerdiest thing I've ever seen on WoW.
---
Where the dick dungeons at?
---
I didn't call you bad, just suggested it. Seeing as how defensive and upset you get I would get it's 100% true. You're not even bothering to read any of what I'm saying and just foaming at the mouth. If I look through your profile will I find a few of those whine posts being you? I'd guess so. You're trying to tell me to change my attitude like it's bad, refuse to change yours, and just keep making shit up.
---
I thank fuck I would never group with you, a tank that can't hold aggro that thinks he's not bad. Lmao, amazing. You know this game is well researched right? You could simply take the time to learn how to play yet instead you'd rather bitch on reddit and make shit up.
---
I've only run into a few PUG tanks that were great and I did add them. Coincidentally 3 were druids. I'm not the type of person to try and make someone do a dungeon with me just because they're were good. And way to assume no one ever hits me up for dungeons.
---
This discussion is pointless though, you refuse to read what I say, make shit up, and are just raging hard. Funny thing is I bet you'd be like all the other bad tanks that can't hold aggro. You wouldn't say shit to the dps, you're too busy being passive aggressive or straight whiny on reddit.
---
You should really do some self reflection. If you have to pretend I'm a boogeyman to justify your own failures then you have a lot of soul searching to do. Have fun taking forever in dungeons because you'll never take the time to learn how to get good.
---
It might not be in classic. Click the tracking icon on your minimap and select low-level quests.
---
Tbh its more subtle.Like the quest chain where we slowly uncovered the AQ threat. Didn't notice it 13 years ago. Also liked the sense of frustration and helplessness at not being able to help much during the starting human storyline
---
Started the launch day....reached lvl 30 last Sunday.
---
My friends are on the same range and so far we've been doin most of the dungeons and having a great time. Honestly, I won't deny that it would be great to get to 60 before phase 2, but this game is a beautiful journey I'm enjoying to the fullest.
---
Guild talks, general chat, dungeons fellas you make on the way, working your ass off to maximize your profession and being able to create useful gear to yourself, that is the real vanilla experience to me.
---
Uhh, in Post-Cata you alone are credited as the savior of the world. Aka a single superhero like he said.
---
Pre-Cata you were just "A member of a world famous adventuring guild" You alone were just a nobody, it was the fact you had 39 other people with you.
---
Goes to show Italian superiority over England.
---
The Yeti are also baller for leather and have a decent respawn rate so that does not help.
---
Yeah I've actually had a shammy tank a full ubrs run, no wipes, we had a fury warrior to pick up some ads but that was it.
---
Why is pvp on a pvp server being an asshole?
---
I thought it was a backpack wtf
---
I think OP is specifically calling out the hypocrisy of some streamers saying that “levelling slow is fine” while they are rushing their alts now.. 
---
I agree to an extent but I think the people that just wanna level at like 30-48 will just level as usual, I don’t think people will even be thinking of farming honor. Just like now, majority of people wanting to quest will just quest around each other. They may kill each other sometimes but no one is specifically farming honor in those levels.
---
48+ on the other hand is a different story, the 60s will be specifically out there farming honor so.. yeah 
---
My own theory is everything will be basically the same except for 48+
---
Fucking bring it, I welcome all challengers.
---
They were dropped on their heads as children
---
Er.. Nice job dropping warriors.
---
Warlocks can solo DM:E, warlocks are the PvP kingpins, duels ban entire warlock specs, etc.
---
And in case you missed the memo: being versatile no one is contesting. Being great at DPS: the shittily geared melee dps classes are already beating three quarter epic geared hunters. check back again in one month when the rogues (and mages) have caught up in gear.
---
I don't know what your obsession is with Blizzard and Hunters, some weird conspiracy theory, but I'm done here, enjoy posting. Some people just don't logic.
---
Alt + Z next time, bro
---
I know majority of players play with very minimal add-ons but by the time you're raiding you should at least use threat meter, you can even set it up to just appear when combat starts only show where you are on the threshold.  Neatplates has it built in and you can actually set it to change colors based on where you're at.
---
There's pvp and there's camping people even after they disconnected on the slight chance they come back. If you don't see the difference, can't help you.
---
The AQ storyline had some buildup but it was very easy to miss
---
I for one welcome our shadow priest overlords
---
Me too lol
---
I survived by canceling! I enjoyed it greatly for a month, then realized I was going down the same time hole I did 15 years ago. Not really interested in reliving that, lol, I’ve got grown up stuff.

Only 1-2 in my guild, it's quite expensive so a lot of the people are still building up to it.

Severe undercutting, especially when it's way above market price, is a great strategy. It trigger fomo and adds to the perception of a great deal. I had a staff of Jordan listed at a very reasonable 170g for 8 days (I bought it for 100g, and I'm in the resale game) it didn't sell. I went to relist again and someone was up there for 290G. I listed mine for 199G and it sold within an hour
---
Not obsolete, but they move the goalposts, I’m still behind the endgame curve and will continue to be if phases are released at their current rate, simply because I want 3 toons and want 300 lvl profs with rare patterns/recipes from rep grinds.
---
I get that this isn’t “efficient” or I could play endgame if I stuck to just one character, but my argument is that there is tons of content to work on and play through beyond having one lvl 60 with bis gear.
---
big true, p2 will suck for a little in the hot zones like stv and hillsbrad but its not the end of the world
---
Thanks, needed to hear it!
---
Lol yeah in those parties you talk to a someone and they ask what you do in your free time and you say play games and they give you that “eheheh” look.. dude you binge watch series like no ones business how am I worse than you
---
Most people I’ve tun into don’t have that much. 
---
How did you earn you gold?
---
Yeah WoWHead has done a fairly decent job of curating their Classic version.
---
Oof, the cringe level of watching someone type "kiddo" for a different opinion
---
So how did you earn you gold?
---
1300 after selling isn't that much for an entire phase. Guess it depends if you're using lots of consumables or not I suppose.
---
The only way it can do that is by storing your bank contents and assuming it doesn't change until you access the bank. If someone else messes with your bank, it's powerless.
---
Take it out if their bag and put it in the bank.  Ftfy
---
The stories lore has been well put out, and is pretty clear to even someone that has watched the recent cinematics, let alone looked at the lore.
---
Incredible fighter... For a human? Sylvanas was an elite Elven Ranger, and is a Banshee queen..
---
THe Lich Kings Power in-part comes from Frostmourne, which is gone.
---
And army of lvl 80 skelllies woooo, so hard.
---
"And he still looked pretty freakin' scary." and you think what I'm saying has no basis? wtf.
---
&gt;It made absolutely 0 logical sense with all the existing story in the game. It's poor writing, and widely hated for it.
---
It makes 100% sense with knowing the story around it. It's very clearly not poor writing ***YOU*** just didn't like it. While also obviously not understanding the meta lore around it.
---
Honest question, how would you beat a hunter?
---
As a priest +healing is your best stat- higher burst heals, and you can downrank spells to use less mana for the same amount of healing too. I think MP5 is your next best.
---
Genrerally you just want to grab whatever pieces are good as you level and then start farming best in slot items as you hit lvl 52/53 in BRD and higher dungeons. 
---
As a mage I have 1 gear set with int/stam and MP5 for farming or pvp, and 1 set with high spell power for dungeons and raids
---
if call of duty is separated classic should be too I guess
---
Tauren always have your back. It’s why I play one.
---
Keyboard turner without a doubt.
---
Talking to the NPC gets you a new one.
---
Item restoration has a time limit, and amulet is the kind of thing that completely bricks your character if you could lose it for good.
---
So what about that isn't player vs player? Apparently you need to enlighten me because everything you just explained is player vs player.
---
It's not that they are assholes it's just you don't agree with his they pvp, which is fine but just because they have fun different than you doesn't make them assholes.
---
A dragon duck
---
For PvP or raids? Absolutely for PvP in terms of strength and if you find it fun then go for it. Even in raids i've seen quite a few ret paladins about, though their dps is pretty bad without some serious gear/consumables but that's largely true for most hybrids and you still offer buffs/auras.
---
You don't have to lecture me, I wasn't leading the raid. They were just told to simply stop dps except for hunters and they refused to and pulled aggro on half the raid every single time. A few of them would even run south even though they were told every single time to go north. Some people are just really really bad, that's the point.
---
Hunter: feigns death.
---
Mob: walks toward healer.
---
Learned it fighting horde that they can get back real quick lol.

Feels good for sure. Went from struggling hard to kill +2 lvls to anything +5 or below being completely safe

Ahhh, but the Engineer Version is better and every Mage has Engineering...

Right guys!?

Dude a good Boar is so good for leveling. The charge is super useful and it’s all around solid.
---
What a ridiculous thing to nitpick over.
---
Maybe the guy is a billionaire and is running tons of AWS instances
---
15 agility is released in the same patch. It gives armor, crit, and dodge.
---
15 strength is also released in the same patch. It's better for offtanks (because 15 str benefits them while they DPS).
---
Sad reality for many
---
"today years old" 🤮

Ive absolutely loved re-imersing myself in the Silithid threat questlines. Multiple zones in Kalimdor you are just, investigating this mysterious threat you have never encountered before, and reporting your findings back to a central investigator in Orgrimmar. Heck, the Silithid are so mysterious they are the only things in the game without a creature type.
---
Awesome! Thanks
---
There are rules against pissing in the pool...there aren't rules against tanking and camping...your analogy doesn't hold water;)
---
Hey, if they weren't willing to group you have just as much right to tag as they do
---
&gt; And army of lvl 80 skelllies woooo, so hard
---
that's the thing
---
going back into the history of the game THEY WOULD MATTER
---
&gt;Wait not ~~that much excitement~~ this soon
---
Ftfy. People expected it to drop somewhere december, not early november...
---
Attendance, performance, how big a gear upgrade.
---
I think it's also very important for guilds to distance themselves from the dps meters a little. Too many guilds suck the top dps's dick and gives him all the loot. Sure you can give him a small reward, but don't get forget about the other players, and don't overlook his attitude, how many mistake he makes, or how long he has been in the guild. It's very easy to get carried away and just instantly reward a top dps for his performance.
---
im learning more about wow history here :-p
---
i got confused and thought they ment patch 1.1.2 lol not 1.12 i was like wait what it wasnt added till 1.5.......then i was like ooooh wait  now i understand :-p.
---
What I did was multiply all of that by 10 and have armor be worth 1. It lets you dip down an armor class when it has truly good stats, but keeps your best armor class gear near the top of the list.
---
What DPS class has the easiest time getting gear and finding groups end-game? Other than warrior.
---
anyone who has taken highschool math immediately triggered by this
---
Threat is a Tank issue. If you want your DPS to literally not press buttons because your tank is stacking full mitigation gear on bosses that hit like paper, that's entirely on you but I doubt they're having much fun.
---
thing is, playing classic again I am very much into it
---
it's a lot of fun adventuring around and solving mysteries or helping ppl, and watching how the different factions build armies and position themselves
---
none of that can exist in the modern comic book game anymore where we are all gods fighting gods
---
No idea, you guys love to whine about a lot of things.
---
So what are you going to do ban the kid for pissing in the pool when countless others have? Are you going to ream out the one person when so many others do the same? Your point makes sense but in this situation it's poor. The idiots who made this are causing grief but so many other players do the same? Why are these the guys getting attacked for how they play the game even though its not the nicest way to play. I don't condone this kinda of play and I never gank people without a reason but people always attack others for when it doesn't conform to their 'idea'. It's a fucking video game. I'll be glad to have a discussion on why you think I'm right or wrong.

---
The pvp grind was grueling compared to the bug mount.

You'd come off as a lot more reasonable if you didn't dismiss criticism of your criticism out of hand.
---
Bolvar not having Frostmourne is by all accounts a big deal. That sword wasn't the sole source of Arthas's power but it was a significant portion of it, and based on how Arthas used it likely a focal point. When he'd revive his armies he'd put his sword out, when he revived a giant dragon he stabbed the ice that kept it prisoner, and the fucking thing did absorb souls and "hunger" even long after Arthas and the Lich King had become the one entity.
---
That sword was independently powerful and Bolvar did not have it.
---
Besides, in defending the power of Arthas you're giving a Sylvanas a way in. Consistent story telling in this context means alliances and artifacts can bestow incredible power, you've got the mages of Tirisfal who channeled their power through one individual and you've got things like Frostmourne, so Sylvanas ascending the power-curve isn't unreasonable or out-of-universe.
---
Shamans, Warlocks. Druids are rarer and have even less competition for gear, but are not *needed* by raid groups. Whereas if a raid is 35/40 and no shams or locks, they reserve the last few spots for them.
---
they were victorious
---
can we have more of these pls
---
LF3M big dick dps Ony's Snatch
---
Does it? I noticed your mp5 never halted even for the second cast at least for me so I assumed they were both free.
---
Classic is also much quicker and easier than retail because it's a 15 year old game. Also with patch 1.12 talents/gear the game is way too easy to be accurate to original vanilla and so without bgs and just MC there is really not much to do.
---
They should not be slowing classic down anymore than they current are .
---
"raid"
---
Man fuck that aquatic form quest....
---
Any hunters also having problems with their pet stopping attacks mid fight and returning to you?
---
Can we get character transfers please, I want off these crazy imbalanced servers.
---
What is an expet?
---
Yikes, I do not want to hinge my chances of getting the second binding on only 11 more runs of MC... only thing I want to farm for to get Thunderfury in phase 3 is Elementium Ingots.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Idk man. I am a frost mage, gnome to boot. I start winding up my frostbolt about 0.5 seconds before the mob being pulled gets to the tank. I don't know if our MT is a god but I have never gotten aggro so far.
---
You clever son-of-a-gun (or bow).
---
 /burp
---
Not if you quested in Tanaris, Un'Goro and Feralas, as Horde at least. They outright warn you about the increased silithid activity and that a larger, potentially world ending, threat is looming. They directly suggest to the player that there's a larger force in play, in the form of an ancient deity.
---
Walk up and stun, chop. Can’t stop/slow a paladin ;)
---
And I'd rather not wipe because some warlock pulled agro 10 seconds into the fight. If you're doing runs where you're killing rag before he submerges you have the coordination to go ham, because your tank is probably fury/prot.
---
But for the average group, I'd much rather dps just wait a couple extra seconds and not pull agro. Even if we have to do one extra phase.
---
If I left my guild I doubt Id find another to raid with as a warlock. Every guild Ive seen is full on them. We are running 6 because theyre so plentiful.
---

---
Wrong
---
My only gripe with vanilla is the fact that warrior prot isn't viable for pvp.
---
If only they ported WotLK prot to vanilla.
---
No, but there are plenty of times where it will stand on top of the mob I just killed until I call it back.
---
That's actually high..
---
In your guys' opinion, which alliance race/gender is the most fitting for Warlock, class fantasy/lore wise?
---
My only suggestion is you mention disco priests can drop a meteor on your head every so often.
---
A quest chain that starts with "Test of Faith" in thousand needles, medium length walk from the place Steelsnap is at. And the part /u/kingarthas2 is talking about is the first few "Test of Lore" quests in the sidebar here: https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1149/test-of-faith

Bruh I was still having to argue this shit like last week -_-
---
I'm glad I was the first to roll on a server and not my friends or I definitely would be stuck in frustration right now. My reasoning was I don't have unlimited time to play and if my main toon is getting camped I can't play the game.
---
People can still participate in world pvp if they flag themselves, it seems a lot of people looked at it as all or nothing.
---
High pop horde favored. Ya of course it was fine lol
---
Very well written, you should definitely do more content like this
---
Yeah hunters have like 2+ seconds between each auto and a 3 second cast time skill. They don't want to attack mobs that die quickly, as it wastes so much of their dps potential.
---
He said uterus not vagina?
---
Human, gender doesn't matter, but I think female locks look better
---
True: guess I'm really just referring to compared to how embedded in lore Kel Thuzad is: but there were the Nerubians so even back then the insectoid races were hinted at.
---
What whisper mod is that?
---
Loot council = arbitrary ML. DKP is where it’s at
---
It's because on a PvE server, people who flag themselves are generally looking for PvP.. and are prepared for it as well. That's not who the people yelling about carebears are interested in, they only care for a fight they can't lose.
---
It\`s not competitive PvP. It\`s griefing, plain and simple. Closest thing in LoL would be intentionally feeding kills to enemy mid.
---
Nice RP m8
---
Don’t hit them!! Hitting mobs that are chasing you just extends their leash distance. I’m always surprised at how quick mobs leave me alone if I just keep running
---
I rerolled and currently level 30 (was 52) I'm already feeling left behind.
---
Hard to get dungeon groups, people to help with elite quests. While is see high level dungeons dominate lfg channel.
---
The sentiment is nice and don't want to disagree but I'm living it in game ATM, and it's sucking.

&gt; A bit funny to dismiss it because its not something you enjoy
---
I never said that.
---
&gt; And as with everything it begins with community interest and discussion. I think such things definitely have impact on game development.

So... Ive been hanging Ashvane’s dirty skanky razor coral from my ears? Ew.
---
And ported classic warrior to WOTLK.   Perfect world.
---
There is certain thing to help to set rule for fair and transparency. 
---
I will show you how my guild do it
---
-We have a spreadsheet of all raid gears bis that everyone can read.
---
-We have transparent voting that have 3 officer, 2 raiders that rotate randomly every week. Guild master never vote but if drama happen, he has the final say only if voting doesn't work.
---
-we keep track of raid attendance/guild partipation.
---
-we also have wishlist each run by each raider if we ever get draw and roll off.
---
-we also take account of people want it footnotes
---
If you spend time on Kalimdor I think it's worth setting your hearth to Gadgetzan. Besides having a bank (though you probably won't use the auction house), it's decently close to a number of high level areas. It's also not far from both Theramore and Ratchet if you want to catch a boat to either end of the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
it is, unless you have someone that's bad. it's the type of raid that 1 bad person can ruin it  
---
Example 1: person just walks through the eggs like they're playing connect the dots  
---
Example 2: person doesn't know how to put back to wall, gets knocked down, fears, runs back to the group after playing the above game of connect the dots  
---
Example 3: "I can't recall my totems, that isn't in the game yet" on the rend jump.   
---
Example 4: "...why did your pet just run through that barred door"  
---
Example 5: "JUST FN STAY UP OR DOWN THE LEDGE IF I ASKED YOU TO"  
---
Example 6: "...Why are there dots on drak as he's running toward the kiting hunter"
---
Tbh I think 90% of the player base doesn't care about multiboxing. Not really on either side personally because I'm casual at this game, but I know a lot of people are just like me. 
---
How does multiboxing even negatively effect others?

There is one above it too, which is more accessible for Alliance.

Directly where the K is in 'Sun Rock Retreat'. It cuts all the way over to where the S is.
---
100% sure it would have to be A
---
Its time based.  That's all you really need to know.  The highest rank goes to those who invest the most time.  Its also relative to others in your server, so it varies.  More populous servers will have more competition and require more BG wins and HKs each week.
---
Ya but what are you getting from Goblin? Go Goblin, make all the BoP items, swap to gnomish for the teleport to Tanaris. 
---
If you’re mining, sure you can make your own sappers. But otherwise you’ll be buying the mats or sappers anyway as Goblin. You can do the same as gnomish if you’re not a miner. If the end product is more expensive than the mats, you can always have another Goblin engineer craft from the mats.
---
As far as I know, the only BoP Goblin/Gnomish required items are the teleport trinkets. Also the world enlarger from gnomish.

Copy paste of the blue post. It does not say phase. They also haven't called phases patches. Maybe the made a mistake and they meant to say phase. But they aren't the same thing.

    Yes, we do have the Keyring coming to WoW Classic. It won’t be available at launch, but it will be added in the first patch.
---
    
---
    We don’t yet have a timeframe for the first patch.
---
    The Keyring should function as it did in original WoW 1.12, with the same capacity and key compatibility.
---
I just figured that since it's not combat or ass, that it got a bad rep. It genuinely looks fun, but I like my poisons. Probably gonna roll sub if I don't like the charge system.

Exactly that! Usually they are busy thanking me for the first half of there health bar. I’d say 50% of the time they just sit there half confused and half content with death, or simply shocked by the sudden heel turn to fight back. Great fun!
---
Real questions is, if they went to a job interview, would they wear a combined tie around both necks? Or a neck tie each?
---
The BFD quest wand is really good at around 24.  After that the upgrades become smaller.
---
Ah, I'm not a huge fan of instance grinding and wouldn't really give general advice based on it.
---
Ony is taunt immune and absolutely wrecks the raid if she isn't facing the right way... so yeah, it very much is about not pulling aggro. It has a nasty habit of wiping the raid.
---
I love how many people, no matter how long this game goes for, simply *can not* master the very simple ability to wait a few seconds.
---
Only min/maxing tryhards don't bring underleveled people to their dungeons, right fellow redditors?
---
You usually run felpup in BGs.  Succ is too fragile.  She was good for lvling, because her dmg sustain was the best.  VW never held aggro, so I didnt bother.
---
That’s because in canon you are the “group of adventurers” who started as nobodies, but went on to save Azeroth dozens of times over the years.  Your character participated in the defeat of onyxia, rangnaros, the lich king, deathwing, and many more powerful threats.  Of course you’re going to known as a champion of your faction.  
---
It wouldn’t make sense for your character to remain a random nobody after doing all of those things.
---
Don’t do bgs in the lvl 19 bracket if you don’t like it. Can’t you understand the enjoyment that comes with outfitting level 19 twink with the best gear in the game? At no small cost either.
---
tried to make it somewhat oblivious in my original comment that I'm quite aware. in fact, this very thing has already happened back in TBC, partially for world pvp shenanigans (fearing/MCing enemy players into mobs and being a general pain in the ass), partially since I might have corpsecamped the leader of a pvp guild (or his alt, to be more precise) after he attacked me while leveling, for over an hour, teabagging him each time he tried to res and run away, then might have taunted them with the screenshots of said teabagging (and their leaders absolute incompetence) when they were trying to recruit.
---
ah, fun times.
---
bottom line is, it's all par for the course on pvp servers, and honestly, I don't think it's a realistic danger for most players - corpsecamping someone to shit takes time and effort (and a big repair bill if they're smart), something not a lot of people are willing to put in for some petty vengeance.
---
Lol, al this time I went through the barrens
---
Oh come on dude he either knew it and typed the wrong thing or misremembered a word that was extremely close to another.
---
You can't pull aggro on Rag as ranged (and as melee you're more likely to just get swatted in a single swing), so knock yourself out.
---
We keep having ranged do stupid shit like overaggroing Onyxia so she turns  and breathes half the raid to death, or peeling Geddon off the tank so he AoEs the entire raid and forces everyone to run. That's a lot worse than losing 3 seconds of DPS on the boss.
---
That said, 5 sunders is a bit overkill most of the time, but letting the tank get a head start and being aware of how much damage you do and slowing down or using an aggro drop ability if you get some early crits should be fairly basic tools in any DPS player's toolkit.
---
Yes, she breathes straight up fuego all over you
---
I don't think so.  The objectives were rather bland and didn't encourage any particular engaging play style.
---
There is an alliance counterpart?
---
Something doesn’t need to lead to tangible results to not be a waste of time. Discussion in itself is valuable.
---
Lost it at the Warlock.
---
It's mind boggling how strong warlock really is in random open world pvp against unskilled and midskilled players even if you totally suck at pvp. 
---
I regulary burst into laughter about how broken my class is
---
Maybe I read into it wrong but it felt like you were dismissing the entirety of the post because going to TBC is retail or bad or something. 
---
Of course this post will probably not have an impact and its probably wanking but thats what sites like these are for. Discussions on topics related to WoW Classic, and in this case a potential future option.
---
Go back to retail zoomer
---
What's he even talking about

---
Ele sham is too fun. Love the massive burst.
---
Considered that sylvanas didn't go hard against saurfang? She literally one shot him the second she felt like it, up till then she was toying around. Now for bolvar she went in with a purpose and tried hard the entire time, this proving a better fighter.
---
Parries, dodges and misses are things that happen to tanks. Quite a lot. On top of that taunt has a decent chance to be resisted.
---
Misses can be geared away reasonably early (you shouldn't expect all tanks to be hit capped in MC though) and parry and dodge can be mitigated a little with weapon skill, but there's always going to be a chance the tank just has the first couple of skills avoided and starts off with crap threat, no matter how skilled or geared they are.
---
Exactly what I needed to hear -- thanks pal
---
No need for DM buffs lol, current raid content is easy without. The time saved by having them is spent trying to get them.
---
Ah, I understand.
---
Well i only have a 60 warrior on classic but ive been playing both at max level since wrath (war since late vanilla). 
---
So for the rogue ill just give some advice first. When youre doing sustained damage you wanna be pooling energy the entire time. There is no difference in frequency of casts nor damage whether you use an ability at 30 energy vs using it at 80 energy. You should try to keep your energy pool high the entire time so that you have the available energy for combos or multiple skills on demand. Use your skills when youre at high energy, not as soon as you have enough energy for them pooling from zero. That will a lot. 
---
For warrior in classic specifically, one of the biggest ups and downs is demand. Warriors are a dime a dozen. Youll be the most in-demand class BY FAR for leveling and dungeons as long as you roll tank. Youre the king of 5 mans and will always be able to get dungeons whenever you feel like it. You can even charge gold for tanking when youre geared enough. HOWEVER, this is entirely offset when you get to raids. Both guilds and pugs will have tanks established before basically any other role. You only need 2 actual tanks for any raid and the rest can be offtanked by dps wars. You can dps if you want and have slightly better demand, but youre competing for gear with 20 other melee and there is very little available warrior dps gear in the first place. 
---
Youll be a monster in pvp and pve dps for sure, there will just be so many of you that youre gonna have to be more dedicated than everyone else to reach that elite level. Gear will be few and far between. 
---
Honestly I’d suggest against either of the two for classic man. Something casty is gonna be so much more flexible for everything from raid spots to goldmaking to pvp.
---
Have you seen retail?
---
Because then you can say I want WoTLK followed by oh I want MoP.
---
 This asking for more shit needs to go. Enjoy what you got or move on.
---
No. We just think they are lying.
---
I generally hate seeing shield slam on a tank. You don't need deep prot to tank. Beyond the 75% block ability, it's just more important to be able to put out damage so long as your gearing is sane.
---
&gt;No we certainly did not do that in vanilla
---
I'm just using the same dumb argument the guy I replied to is using.
---
The 5% built into your tree is prob fine. The guides for pve are assuming vs bosses that are, effectively, 63. Players are level 60
---
Because they're useless, any DPS that actually have it on their screen knows that they're either slow and inaccuracte (pulling aggro on 80% threat), or straight up useless on fights with aggro reset (hello onyxia).  
---
If the fight is straightforward it's up to the tank to optimize their rotation for max TPS, meanwhile the DPS go all out.
---
Pretty cool video. Also people buy this stuff when leveling. I know of a few people in my guild that bought the items rather than competing prime time for the easy exp.
---
I disagree on Rag kill time.  A guild who has MC on farm should never hit a submerge.  I do agree on the trash time.  Clearing trash efficiently is the time saver.  Dawdle on boss loot or taking too long to clear trash will turn a 2 hour run into a 3+
---
So, I am working from decade old memories of the game here but as I recall most of the pinball bosses started in burning crusade.  In classic most raid bosses if you pull aggro you get killed and it goes back to the tank as second on the list.  Additionally, there are a few bosses who will turn and smack the number 2 guy on the list.
---
Most of the boss fights in molten core are of the type where you need 3-4 tanks because there are 3-4 mobs and you fight them in order from the worst tank to the best.  
---
All of that said, I remember the bigger issue being the gearing.  Paladin raid gear didn't have +def on it.  Additionally, they didn't have any good way of pushing crits and crushes off the attack table consistently.
---
Auto Attack was converted to Cleave
---
Warrior Talent Sword Spec 5% extra attack
---
Hand of Justice 3% extra attack
---
Windfury Weapon fron Shaman extra attack
---
Mortal Strike

Nice screenshot!
---
Honestly, getting barely 2 - 3 kills, corpse running for 120s, getting barely 2 - 3 kills, corpse running for 120s ad infinitum for 6 hours isn't fun because 60s have no life and are ganking constantly.
---
It's no wonder people are quitting, tbh
---
If true
---
Yes I want a complete redo of burning crusade exactly as it happened from patch to patch 
---
That expansion was amazing for raiding, and getting pit on some OP patch from the start would fucking suck.
---
Everybody loves capitalism, until somebody does it better.
---
In retail, I like it, because I was literally auctioning hundreds of items every day. I put maybe 20 items on the AH a day in classic if I'm playing heavily.
---
Hell yeah brother!

They’re more like Plan B

DKP sucked dick back then and still sucks donkey dinks now.
---
It ruined my game play back in the day...in the end ended up in a small laid back guild and enjoyed the game. Sorry not what you wanted to hear. Just not a fan...
---
Yep, farming dungeons will be the safest bet. There's going to be times you'll have to jump back into the world to grab quests for attunements and stuff as you approach 60, but otherwise you can live in dungeons, and there should be a healthy number of groups since everyone else will be doing the same thing.
---
Drop enchanting. At this point it's trivial to re-level it at 60 if you want it back, but it's just a huge gold sink, and you would probably need guild support to help you close the last 75 levels to 300. Go skinning or herb, level it up to 200 before P2, and you won't have any more money issues on your way to 60. At that point you can decide whether to spend the gold and time on enchanting.
---
You won't be forced to respec at 55 unless you want to heal. You might have to wait longer for a group as DPS, but that's no problem if you're committed to shadow. The respeccing to healing thing is mainly for raiding, as no more than one shadow priest will get into a given raid, and many won't even take one. This is something you wouldn't have to worry about until 60 (or very close to it), and if you don't want to raid then it's no problem at all.
---
On PvP servers you'll find that people will mostly only engage you when the scales are tipped in their favour. No amount of prep is going to stop people trying to tank you while you're killing a mob. You can retaliate, but mostly this will just stuck up time from levelling, and usually end up with the person you kill getting two 60s to come camp you.
---
Him and the currently 40 people that upvoted him.
---
True. Also, a lot of people don't know what the market value is. Not everyone uses TSM or auctioneer. If an item is the only one listed, they have no reference. If there's two items, and one of them is a lot cheaper, there's an instant implication that they might be getting a deal. There's also the fear that if they don't take the cheaper one now, someone else might, and they have to pay the higher price, so fomo kicks in.
---
Imps phase shift and can't pull while phase shifted as they can't be attacked. Succubus will be invisible not phase shifted and definitely will pull if she walks to close to a unit with invis detection.
---
I'm leveling a warlock alt and can confirm. I'm not good at pvp but I've killed rogues (my ultimate nightmare of classic) even though they've snuck up on me with low up and mana, no pet, no hs, no ss. I don't know if they're bad or I'm lucky or the class is broken or what's going on but I'm happy about it. I can't even imagine what it's like with gear.
---
I would say that I wish that they had used the pre-burning crusade vanilla state patch.  The one that was released just ahead of TBC that finally made all specs viable.  That is the version of the game that should have been released with classic.  Granted the itemization would suck balls for a lot of classes but at least there wouldn't be one true spec for each class.
---
In my experience dkp systems only care about attendance and bosses downed.  However, a group can always add to that.  I could see extra points for Raid mats specifically, but would cap the points for week that could be earned by a single player rather low.
---
Blizzard already said if they go down that path they are stopping at WoTLK.
---
There goes no fap November
---
I dunno man this meme is fuckin' hilarious.
---
pve is just glass cannon as it generally has very low stamina.
---
people are prob confused why im so much tankier than other mages when they fight me in my necropile set. i also dont lose 1v1s because of this.
---
Personally I'd rather be able to craft the sappers myself then to bother a friend/guildie to craft them for free. Usually sappers cost more than the materials themselves.
---
&gt;tanaris vs winterspring teleport?
---
Pretty much.
---
if they can open on the hunter (say, dismounting right next to them), quite easily, rets have enough control and damage for that. if the hunter opens on them, well... then the pally will be walking menacingly towards him while he slowly dies, because they have nothing to close the distance.
---
Karen's legacy lives on for her to rise again, it seems. This was a conversation I saw last night.
---
Why censor him? Let people see who he is so nobody buys shit from him and he learns that there are repercussions when you act like an asshat
---
I meant the guy that’s thinking that tube below the uterus is a vaginal canal, Because.....
---
He might want to review some sex ed facts
---
As a fellow skinner, my favorite are the Yetis just SE of Everlook in Winterspring. They drop money, occasionally a good 1-2g vendor grey weapon or armor, and you can skin them. I usually will clear about 10g an hour from just their cash drops/grey vendor, and then the leather sells on Ah for 1-1.5g per stack (and we all know rugged is sold immediately upon putting on the ah). They'll also drop greens occasionally that I usually just vendor.
---
I did this yesterday and was able to get enough money to buy all of the fiery and lava cores for my black dragonscale boots in about 4 hours, about 80g on my server.
---
Only problem is this is a high traffic area, but then there's lots of people just leaving the Yetis on the ground so you get free leathers.
---
You can also occasionally branch a little farther south and kill a few chillwind chimeras for the chimeric leather, on my server these sell for 6g a stack.
---
You still get kill credit? I tried with the Bellygrub pig and it didn’t count in Redrige.
---
r/whoosh
---
Heavy mageweave is an extra 10s per stack. A stack of mageweave is 50s. So two stacks is 1g. A stack of heavy mageweave is 1.2g, or 60s per stack of mageweave. Regular bandages are 55s per stack of mageweave.
---
Looks like she was finally given her powers back XD but now Karen *is* the manager
---
STV is a bad time all round if you're on a PvP server.
---
If not, it's still a bad time of you're ally while you work through northern STV since there's no convenient FP. Once you get to southern STV it starts to pay off and the zone is pretty good. For horde it's a gravy train.
---
How is Ret Pally pvp in Vanilla? 
---
Pls teach me daddy
---
Why are you bringing up content creators when replying to me stating how we did it in vanilla? It's already fairly difficult to quest in some of the zones because one faction overwhelms the other and they make use of those numbers. The flightmaster in LHC is dead fairly often. 
---
It won't be impossible, but it will definitely be difficult. Are you Hords by any chance?
---
Back in Ye Olden Days ™ before monitors with detail I never really got why the Battle Shout icon was a weird witch.
---
I thought the light part was the face.
---
Sometimes mageweave, too. I've sold stacks for almost 2g before. Sometimes theres very little on the market.
---
Ah - Thats why you can only equip two at a time! Just like rings... Oh wait
---
that's a good call. low level healers are fine and all, but when they can't tell the level of enemy mobs (since all they're seeing are skulls), there will be problems.
---
Also if you have Seal of Command, keep in mind Rank 1 Command still does full damage with it's procs, keep that up and it won't really matter if he purges it, he'll be spending more Mana to remove it than it took to cast it. Other than that, Pally v Shaman is a game of patience if both players are good. Shamans tend to have the advantage though.
---
Most folks are in the 50's? What?
---
so that's what a Uterus looks like, ive never seen that pokemon before
---
just tried this and it didnt work. Accepting summon did nothing
---
Paladins don't run as fast as hunters do in the open world...
---
If you aren't catching them from mounted you aren't catching them at all.  Doesn't matter if you freedom when you run 8% move speed against their cheetah.
---
Best way to deal is to swift pot and surprise sprint into their face.
---
Black ock Mountain
---
You didn't say if you were horde or alliance but at 35 you can find quests in Stranglethorn Vale for either faction that will keep you busy until level 40.  You can also run Scarlet Monastary.
---
Alliance Dragonscale Leatherworker with every possible dragonscale recipe at the moment. Nothing sells, ever. My highest ticket item is Hillman's Cloak. Not even Chromatic Cloak gets me business. I did once sell a Red Dragonscale Breastplate to a holy paladin, so there's that.
---
All of my money comes from skinning. Rugged Leather sells basically the instant you put it on the AH, I make my refined deeprock salt on cooldown and make cured rugged hides, I've sold a couple of those... but really, its just Rugged leather for me.
---
Fucker
---
I thought this was a ss
---
Once again.
---
Play the game or dont.
---
Players will be more likely to engage in PvP once HKs are in.
---
Sub is king in pvp
---
Hoooooly shit Zya and Zyk are still 2v1'ing 15 years later! I had my fair share of run ins back in the day.
---
I would recommend looking up recommended questing areas for your level, and then heading there to get some xp. An aoe build is certainly nice for xp grinding, but at the end of the day you need to remember that there is no rule of thumb or law that tells you how to play. Do what’s fun and enjoy the game even if your pace has to slow down. 
---
Do some research as to what areas you should go into, and head there. Supplement with dungeons. Best of luck!
---
Hard to tell them apart
---
yeah i enjoyed the silithid build up also. When you find out from the Feralas quest that the silithid are spreading out from Silithis and that is why Quilboar and Gnolls are moving north as they were forced from their homes and destabilised, forced relocate into the Feralas, Barrens and mulgore it makes sense of the earlier quests even Mankirks wife is the result of a domino effect of the Silithid threat.
---
I started a guide at 34 and was all over the place but by 45 I was able to follow it completely. You may have to back track a bit but it's worth it. And you can fill in the gaps with grinding/dungeons.
---
Which classic NA server feels alive and breathing? not looking for the raid log server, but looking for a server brimming with life, community, and activity where i can make friends and explore the world and have fun
---
Haha, I upvoted you both!
---
Probably better worded "This depends heavily on your server economy as to how much the AH stuff is worth"
---
Show me that source.
---
Or a hoodie.
---
what the actual fuck
---
&gt; I can't use commas or form sentences lol
---
Its an actual comprehensive story spanning multiple zones across half the continent, with build up, mystery, and a great story.
---
It's okay your angsty teenage years will be over soon.
---
mage aoe'ing at goshek farm when the courier spawned, i started aoeing it too. a guy ran up to me spamming inv but i declined cause i wanted the xp

---
One thing about WoW classic is that most chain quests are short. Skipping quests does not mean you lost out and have to start back. I'd say most chains are 3 to 4 quests. You are perfectly fine to start a zone your level and go.
---
So true
---
Thats why dragons dont mate so well
---
Mail is north, fly us south. Ez to remember
---
You just need 5 percent hit to not miss your abilities in PvP. So if you aren’t going to get any from the talent tree it will have to be from gear.
---
Good luck farming this before a raid. It'd take over an hour. These items always sell, and there's no listing fee either if they don't.
---
That’s my bad I am horde, I did actually head to STV before I logged off earlier also have done a few SM Grave/Library runs but not the other two, you reckon I would be fine doing the other 2?
---
Never miss the fp, always miss the reagent vendor even though i KNOW they are next to the inn.
---
That's not hard. I cant sleep and and east coast on west coast server. If I'm up at 6am on my day off that's 3am server
---
Lunches, brunches, LFG by the pool, considered a fool cause I dropped out of mage school
---
In dungeons as a 60 RDPS, how long should I wait for the tank to get aggro before I start popping off? I usually try to wait until I see 1-2 sunders, (~3-5 seconds after they charge in). I pull aggro sometimes but usually only when my crits go off. For all the tanks out there, when do you guys want rdps to start going in?
---
Thanks bud :)
---
That’s good to hear man appreciate it
---
Ok that's what I thought just wanted to confirm, thanks
---
That proc is raid Dps worthy, like Nightfall
---
I did it during raid :)
---
Drops off drak is the worse because everybody mostly wants to do jed rend only
---
The dialogue in the shadowlands cinematic was pure CRINGE
---
It ain’t that hard tbh. The essence doesn’t take that long and you can buy the burning charms for cheap. Don’t farm the tusks on when the server is at prime time
---
Their fault for not inviting, you’re just competition they could have avoided. If they were full however and said so and politely asked if you could wait then you would definitely be in the wrong, because that sucks when people do that. But if they ignore you then it’s fair play imo.
---
Honestly thought they were longer, probs gonna jump back on a guide then thanks man :)
---
Did Scholo with a 55 tank...  Desperate times the first few weeks of classic
---
Done a lot of dungeons where the tank was ~5 levels below the last boss from SM to ZF to BRD to Scholo.  Honestly the worst was VC with a level 15 war on Day 1 followed by a 53 war on Emp...
---
Gotta admit the arms description had me laughing hard, thanks
---
There is no difference to player interaction if you whisper "inv" to someone and get an invite, than if you apply to an lfd advertised group and get an invite, the only difference is 1 person typing "inv and whatever his class is"
---
I have never even encountered one person complaining about my spec let alone hours of harassment, and i leveled moonkin for about 12 levels.
---
The cogwheel on details -&gt; plugins:raid

It's 10% per kill in 1.12.

It was fun, hope to see you on the battlefield sometime!
---
Lmao u win.
---
It took you more effort to type that out than for me to take the picture.
---
Why can't you kick them in over?
---
The last part of your comment 
---
Is why I dont think fury/prot is ideal for farming dungeons to get gear
---
Lol, you can always come back!
---
It sold for 700g on my server

The man at the mall who built my computer didn’t install screenshot software

Good God retail's inflation is insane.
---
retail is what art looks like when its made by someone who just led a focus group
---
10hrs a day min for 6 months
---
ironically when Shadowlands come players will be happy when they reach level 60 too ;-)
---
60 is the new 120.
---
Haha usually pretty uneventful. I have the odd interaction here and there. But most of what I do is messing with lfg.
---
Anything above 10 requires massive time commitment. Its hard to say because this is a completely new situation. There are more players, more knowledge, more people after it.
---
And one thing in AQ.
---
whatever helps you sleep at night man
---
Not if 40 of them show up and ROTFLstomp you. 
---
Honor gains aren't zero sum. The more total HKs the more each player needs to rank up. So sitting around ganking toons that don't give honor is in effect *losing honor* if there a lot of others on your faction getting decent HK/hour while you aren't.
---
Commenting to refer back to after work. Thanks team
---
So weird, turns out competent players don't want to group with people being aggressively casual about their characters.
---
Did what?
---
You and your husband are the core of the group. Anyone complaining is infinitely replaceable. The first time or two doing a dungeon you're probably trying to do a lot quests and/or are on the low side of levels to complete it. Don't worry if it goes slow and don't sweat it if someone complains. Boot them and replace if they're obnoxious. They'll wait in LFG for a tank far longer than the  amount of time you could save by going a bit faster. You'll learn the sweet spot for your damage mitigation and your husband's mana.
---
You could talk most everything minutes being a main raid tank like you mentioned.  Ubrs, lbrs and dire maul are laughable with a competent group.  Onyxia theres is no taunt so it's only threat gen there, in mc there are the annihilators for trash that need a taunt rotation, shazz needs taunt so need 3 tanks that can taunt,  and obviously wouldn't be tanking rag most likely.  Other than those though you could easily be assigned to a second or third target on most boss fights with multiple mobs.  You have plenty of time to build aggro so never need to worry about taunting usually if you are not on the skull target.  You are not much help if another tank dies for some reason or just loses aggro, you won't be saving the day in that situation. 
---
All that being said, I love pally tanks when I'm on my mage.  I love pally healers when I'm tanking on my warrior.  For 5 man dungeons pallies definitely my favorite.  If you plan on being half casual anyways I wouldn't see any issues with rolling the pally tank.  The problem is getting a tank spot with most guilds established.
---
My chemical romance, *the person*.

Just use your temporal discombobulator...
---
These aren’t the boomer being referred too. 
---
Boomers are retired however there’s a new term that has come up in the past year or so for Internet boomers those you did not grow up with the Internet basically 28+
---
Bold of you to assume I typed it. Now go back to being a special snowflake with your oh so artsy photographic skill.
---
You don't burst them down. You outrange Fear (only a 24-yard range talented) and wear them down with your DoTs. Meanwhile, you remove Curse of Agony from yourself and let your Rejuv heal off the damage from Corruption and Siphon Life. The reflector allows you to open with melee damage (Ravage -&gt; Rake -&gt; Rip) without eating a Death Coil into a Fear. Then, after your initial burst, you can run out of Fear range, Moonfire + Insect Swarm, and force them into a battle of attrition (which you can win).
---
You're only fucked if they have Soul Link. But then again, so is every other class in the game.
---
Rofl riiiiiight over your head
---
Imagine needing Nightfall for this content lawl
---
In canon, their characters did those things, though.
---
Welcome to the server.  It feels a tad more horde favored, but I’m a hordie so whatevs.
---
I just assume other people are, so when I post LFG for an instance I use both channels + world. I keep a separate tab for those 3 channels so I only ever have to lol at it when I want to.
---
It would be amazing if they were a real flower.
---
Globaled, not one hit :)
---
Did you just assume my skills??
---
Expect 24 hours a day with account sharing.
---
Look at the jump, man. Onyxia, Nefarian, Ragnaros, c’thuns -eyeball-
---
That’s the jump I’m talking about. In one, you’re a cog in a very large machine trying to take down these forces. You’re one of a the soldiers sent to defeat these threats....
---
Then we’re squaring off with Arthas, Deathwing, old ones.. it’s insanity.
---
I want to go back to thinking a dragon was the all powerful nutso crazy baddie I need 39 friends to have a chance against.
---
Water is going for about 21g on my server atm and undeath is going for about 1g, it’s a 24 hour xmute, I luckily got the recipe off Onyxia and it basically just prints gold every 24 hours.
---
I dun wanna say you're a scrub who's clueless about the game, but there's more to it than titles.
---
Does anyone know what the Blink ability icon is supposed to be?
---
it's become apparent to me that 99.9% of the people who insist that deep prot sucks have never played vanilla or classic with even 15 points in the prot tree. all they can say is " you don't need prot to tank" and that's the grand summation of their entire experience with the tree. 
---
they're like the people who argue against manual transmissions because they never learned to drive one.
---
Post a video using reddit's image system, a miracle it actually worked
---
It was not uncommon for multiple people to play the one account 24/7 to GM etc in vanilla... It may depend server to server
---
Agreed. Loot council is HANDS DOWN the best form of loot distribution, but a disclaimer tonthat is only IF the council is fair.  
---
I knownthere are corrupt loot councils, but I'd also venture to say that manybof the people who complain about them are selfish and expect more loot than a properly loot counciled guild would allow them to get.
---
Yeah anyone defending this guy must haven’t had heard about this guy for too long.  This guy is a colossal PoS.  Idk if this guy even streams anymore but just watch him for 5 minutes and you’ll understand.  Constantly talking about how smarter he is than anyone, how much greater he is, this guy SERIOUSLY has some narcissistic problems going on.
---
I don’t know, the B ribcage looks closer to the thicc ogre frame if you ask me.
---
Hes south.
---
Mailbox north.
---
Undercity solved
---
Nah, classic memes are funnny.
---
Just because you’re complete nerds doesn’t mean we all are.
---
I just wait for the mind blast then I get to taunt &gt; sunder &gt; sunder.
---
Careful buddy, I got laid into earlier for implying that I answered people’s questions if they asked. Round these parts, you’re supposed to say “I told the stupid fuckscrub to google it and RNGesus game me an epic to show his approval”
---
I remember this happening while playing in the past, very clever thinking to use it for unlimited mana!
---
Ideally the first GCD after the fury warriors charge.
---
Fury warriors will roll on it and leather.
---
A non throttling Frost will out aggro Rogues cos Feint/Vanish
---
Furies... Well, too bad
---
Well I don’t.  I like that my characters grow in power with their experiences.
---
Should've been human!
---
Based upon the past in regards to both vanilla and pservers, it should be:
---
Rank 10 - (2-4 hours per day)
---
Rank 11 - (4-6)
---
Rank 12 - (5-8)
---
Rank 13 - (7-12)
---
Rank 14 - (10-18)
---
The range is going to vary dramatically on each realm, expect the highest population realms to be on the upper end of the range, and the lowest population realms on the lower end of the range.
---
?
---
I am a 48 holy priest and I can’t decide what gear to carry. I most quest but also sometimes heal dungeons. I have:
---
Weapons:
---
Hypnotic blade (1H, +8int,
---
+3 spi, +9 spell power)
---
Cloud stone (OH, +10 int, +10spi, +10 arcane resistance)
---
Orb of forgotten seer (oh, +12 sp)
---
Resurgence rod (2h, +8mp5 and +5hp5)
---
Rings
---
Agamaggans clutch (+5 sta, +9 spi)
---
Woodseed hoop (+9int, +5sta)
---
Ring of subtlety (+4mp5)
---
What should I keep and what should I vendor?
---
I think I fucking love you dawg.
---
It is, they have been saying since months before launch that they want phase 1 to be particularly fast as theres not much to do outside of leveling.
---
The clueless scrubs are the ones who believe the pvp will just be BRM and TM vs SS, you realize that right?
---
The best way to rank is solo or small group gank squads.  Every ranker is going to want to get a couple kills on you, solo preferably for maximum honor with the least DR.   All 48+ zones will be shit shows the first week and til 1 faction on the server comes out on top (most likely horde as they have more pop on every  pvp server) and losing the faction will be camped hard. Then the losing faction's casuals will stop logging in, which means less targets for the winning faction, so the people didn't quit are now getting camped and killed even more.
---
This has played out multiple times on private servers, the only way to reduce is it is to release BGs ASAP.
---
sure but its less likely compared to cloth and leather, and he said not warrior so i think it stands.
---
The whining in this thread tho...pve players bitch about PvP even when they have their own phaggot half a game server to play on
---
Illegal Danish?
---
I thought it was a saddle with a ring going through it for some reason.
---
Move in a curve turning kinda towards them as you run, or jump and land on the other side strafe left-jump-right-jump
---
If you can get death coil off, they're dead. Felhunter makes this super easy.
---
could be esl
---
Absolutely. Go hunting in Ashenvale and the like. You should easily be able to get to Private and get the trinket or the like.
---
How is auto attack a global? Only global is MS
---
Why wouldn’t you open up with a bleed?
---
You forgot something my dude
---
There is also a path almost directly to Scholomance from The Hinterlands.  It is a bit more obvious on The Hinterlands map though.
---
Technically maybe, but practically any hunter item is valuable to other people too.  Hunters kinda get screwed in that while everything is a hunter weapon, nothing is really a hunter weapon
---
This guy ducks
---
my biggest hit is 2,500 crit atm
---
My friend was saying he's discouraged to even start playing classic, because he won't be able to get any good pvp gear when AV comes out. He said in vanilla only the top 1% of players with the highest honor got epic pvp items. So like the bottom 99% of players that don't grind BGs 8 hours + a day won't be able to compete at a top level. Is there any truth to this? How does PVP gear work in classic?
---
&gt;I can tell from your other replies you're pretty adamant about this / angry or something.
---
Yeah I'm adamant about this because this subreddit constantly upvotes their biases when they are said by people like the guy I originally replied to who doesn't even know how defensive stance works.
---
&gt; but also not a soul on the server I play on at level 60 uses a 2hander and runs LBRS/UBRS/STRAT/SCHOLO/DM. Sword and board or two 1 handers in fury spec with a couple MC pieces. Every one of them.
---
Yeah because Arms is no good in raids because Mortal Strike pushes off priority debuffs. So you have gearing warriors who were told they need to be deep prot to tank end game dungeons or raid spec fury warriors.
---
Warlocks have banish.  Raids need at least 2 if not 4 banishes at a time, so a minimum of 4 warlocks is common
---
Usually had our offtanks use them if they weren't tanking or when their target died. It was a luxury thing, not a 'always have' thing.
---
This was in a good guild though, and our enh sham actually didn't suck and was allowed to use HoR.
---
This will be completely different though. We're talking organized groups of people playing all day, every day with the sole purpose of killing people in the open world for honor.
---
Pre-honor and post-battlegrounds, world PvP is mostly spur of the moment. This particular phase will be brutal for everyone who isn't in an organized PvP group.
---
You can still do exactly that with the modern "LFG" tool, for what it's worth.  You see the group leader's name and you can include a note when you sign up.
---
Sometimes it’s a pain trying to get behind when it’s moving around, so cheap shot and then quickly running to the back to continue attacking is faster.
---
It also makes it easier to quickly apply slice and dice and start the rotation.
---
what's everyone's opinion on logs and parses?
---
I use them all the time to inspect my play and try to push myself to do better each week. Some of my guildies think even logging raids leads to toxic behavior.
---
No clue on what optimal end game. I know there’s not much defense gear for druids and they go more for armor and dodge. But leveling I wouldn’t worry to much about tank stats. Just go with whatever you feel is best. My experience as a healer is that Druid tanks are usually durable regardless of gear.
---
My guild raids and City every week. 
---
I played in vanilla and we raided enemy cities. We didn't care about honor. We did it because it was fun.
---
Doing stuff like going to the Barrens and killing fight Masters is just good fun
---
So uh.  You pointing it out to me now is today...so 38. Been playing this since I was 24
---
If you weren’t already wrong, you lost all credibility when you implied enhancement is a greater threat than elemental.
---
He worked on vanilla.  I dont recall hearing him work on Classic.
---
As a healer who healed almost every dungeon with an arms or fury warrior as a tank, you simply do not need to be kept to tank dungeons.  It’s really not an issue like at all
---
hmmm ok, he said easy to gear dps that can find groups, hunter is ranged dps so thats a plus, less gear crowding than any other class besides warrior...just putting in my hunter bias 2 cents. how about you make an argument for another class that defeats those points instead of not helping OP at all?
---
But, weekly resets?
---
I think everyone should be 50 or higher. If you wanna down the boss especially. 
---
49 is good time for some mara. Get the cepter and do princess runs.
---
Scholo, as no tank really wants to run it as they have nothing really to get from there.
---
Strat live and reserve the orbs for you
---
they're actually really good in molten core with short fights. The encounters only starts getting long with nefarian/AQ and naxx, until then they're great.
---
The shadow priest in my guild is one of the best caster dps currently. Sure rogues and warriors are better but on good caster fights like ragnaros he's on the top
---
Water is 18-20g while undeath is easily under a gold on my server. Very profitable for sure. 
---
Life to earth is also good. The transmute recipe was under 80g before Dire Maul came out and is now 400g+
---
Yes, and yes
---
HoJ is 2% extra chance not 3.
---
I auto wand once before i start frost bolt.
---
I've considered adding a macro for when I use blizzard saying "Things are getting dicey I'm going to AoE prep a heal for when I pull aggro."
---
They did this one on purpose.  I believe it was 2 or 3 years after launch when it came up in an interview with the designers regarding raid mechanics.
---
 They said that at the end of the day they found shapes and objects you were familiar with would bring you back. They said that if you took notice in UBRS and UD Strat you could see that Epstein didnt kill himself.
---
Prot is pretty badass for pvp. Im the MT so im in almost full epics with over 6k hp after getting a priest stam buff. I got engineering and in world pvp noone stands a chance 1v1 except for frost mages.

Unless you are trading HKs, it's going to take 40-50 hours a week of game play to grind rank 12/13.
---
If you trade HKs (you'll need several hundred people, to rotate kills or maximum points per kill) you can hit your weekly cap in a few hours a week.
---
But Rank 14 is impossible to wintrade this way, and will be dependent on how sweaty your server is.

I ended up quitting my server went to shit on the alliances side and they did t offer xfers it’s to bad :(
---
Bow campers in the human starting zone man. Wow only players have no fucking clue what brutal PvP is.
---
&gt;Initial threat doesn't really mean much if you can only do it once a minute.
---
It takes around a minute to kill the average pack and for casters to drink afterwards. And no I don't mean the healer. The only time I find healer mana is what is holding the group back is when the DPS are all melee.
---
&gt;Literally 2nd pull in lbrs without CC when using a 2h you can die in 3 gcd.
---
I've never had a problem there.
---
&gt;And idiot for warriors is why the 2h tank meta is hated so much.
---
Most idiot warrior "tanks" are DW fury. They still would be no better if they used 1h/shield.
---
Definitely. It's pretty funny that I got 10 downlikes. I feel pity for those people...
---
Gaming is for fun. If you're not having fun, move along. Same thing with a relationship, job, city, or any situation...
---
And you sound like an annoying rule lover, are you by any chance a police officer by trade? It sounds like you get off on ordering people around  and THAT’s very offputting, I usually antagonize people like this in dungeons. I hate when slow and often unadaptove players whine about stuff like this, sometimes you have to sheep another target other than the marked target for different reasons. Following rules is not the mark of a great player, being able to adapt to new circumstances is.
---
Pretty tough to get a group where all orbs are reserved to you. But first orb of every run is very common.
---
hahaha yep
---
too bad its just text no animations or sounds or anything ;-)
---
This is true.
---
dungeon sets are garbage for any class and tier sets aren't bis for most classes
---
The main issue with shadow imtemization is that crit sucks for them
---
-_-
---
We must go deeper. 
---
Please tell me someone was taking a picture of you taking a picture of you taking a picture of the screen.
---
Do you mean by taking a fee? And I’m pretty sure there is some tank loot in there and I’m sure some dps gear if they want to build their off spec. 
---
Though the could reserve the Dark Runes to sell on the AH. Doubt that’s better than reserving orbs from strat live though.
---
Congrats on being one of today’s lucky 10,000.
---
If you’re going to complain about PvP ruining the game you really shouldn’t have rolled a PvP realm in the first place.
---
Post gets removed otherwise
---
Ambush eviscerate, vanish!
---
Lucky for me I'm only level 41!
---
Yes, there is, because then buyers think the price listed 50% lower than the next one is a bargain
---
The defense gear will help if you are tanking dungeons higher than your level, but if you close or above in level I wouldn’t worry about it just get as much armor as you can. You will be fine.
---
What I have seen some tanks do is they get ANYTHING that isn’t actually needed by someone in the party, eg all greens, most boe’s bags, runes ect.
---
Hmm yes, that's why we bring two hunters and six mages...
---
Is there anything more edgy than Undead Rogue PvP?
---
Yeah I think of that post every time and it works so well
---
Should I count on Blizzard delivering a fair world PvP experience that doesn't mess with my ability to enjoy the game in classic or roll PvE?  
---
That wasn't a hard choice.
---
Plus the group bonus! This is the way 100%.
---
Ugh I want those
---
It's the mount which is 0.03% I believe, the blade is more like 1% (similar to ironfoe)
---
Classicauradurations
---
My experience in Vanilla was bad because by the time I made it to 60, the expansion was out.  When that happens, no guilds ran MC or BWL or Ony because it was pointless.  They all had ran it over and over and over and over thousands of times and were burnt out of it.
---
By the time I was ready to try them, no one wanted to go after it because of new content.
---
If Classic stays as is then so be it, but of they add more content such as behind 60, there will be a time when no one runs MC again unless the rare guild who tried but has no clue what they are doing and never figures it out.
---
Someone tell blizzard this dude has TWO phones
---
I was literally just thinking of this today. 
---
Because usually a trinket is just something you carry around. A rabbit’s foot or a key chain, which led me to think why would the designers settle on only two equip-able trinkets. Because then all trinkets in your backpack are technically still viable and should be useable. 
---
Then I thought it should have been called Earrings or something. That way you are “limited” to two and the game would be kind of progress on man jewelry lol. Guess they thought of this before though.
---
Small world though.
---
Don't loot it until they move away or just don't loot at all in the case that they just sit there.
---
I leveled to 60, and now doing 5mans to get BiS as a restoration druid with a protection paladin partner.
---
Thanking is never a problem, unless there is a boss with frequent aggro reset. Any AoE DPS we have is in awe they can go crazy on mobs due to consecration and thorns combo.
---
But wait, how did you take this picture?
---
Ya, I love world PvP but I’m not like this at all.
---
I like being able to basically tell someone to fuck off and fight over resources, spawns, nodes, etc...
---
I like having to be situationally aware of the world, cautious, etc...
---
I don’t gank lowbies, don’t camp unless someone won’t get the message and move along. I don’t kill people just to get off on giving them a bad day, does nothing for me. 
---
And it’s fun as hell turning the tables in trash players that do.
---
I'd prioritize getting to at least 350 healing at all costs at first. As a priest you'll be getting about 70 of that from your spirit talent, so 280 from gear. Below 250 healing, your highest rank gheal is your most mana efficient rank of heal/gheal. At 250 healing they are all about the same mana efficiency, and once you pass 250 healing from here on out your lowest rank is your most mana efficient.
---
Alliance don't have enough quests to skip any areas unless they spend a lot of time in dungeons.
---
Would’ve loved this if I were still in Korea. Had such a hard time playing online PC games alone.
---
They don't leave lmao they wait for the devilsaur to despawn if you don't loot it.
---
They literally just an auto clicker lol and no it’s not ban-able.
---
what addon do you use that changes the font of the dmg text? ty! sorry for being off topic
---
Thats what I started doing. However, that doesn't make me money. The entire reason i'm there. I don't kill devilsaurs for my health.
---
Oh you are just classic. *Definitely* not a loser. 
---
You sure proved me.
---
Do you not have phones?
---
Ally Skeram feels nearly unplayable. I went to Herod Horde for like 5 minutes at 10 AM server time on a Monday and it was infinitely more active than Ally Skeram at peak hours.
---
I'm legit gonna reroll and say fuck it to my 500 hour /played Warlock because the Horde megaguilds completely killed the server.
---
60% of the time, it works every time ;P
---
No man i thought it was that too until 2 minutes ago..
---
all you needed was "screenshot saved" written on your screen
---
Nice Damage. It’s a decade old but still works just fine.
---
I been outta the active wow player base for a while now but to macro skills i believe you open a new macro window and shift click skills / items to use them in the macro.
---
I misread and thought you said solo the dungeon lol
---
My character wakes up after a nightmare at level 85, realizing everything after icecrown Citadel didn't happen, and he has a real adventure to go off to.
---
Mostly joking as I did like a lot of the expansions content, at least as far as leveling went, up until this current one
---
what proc lol
---
I should've rolled pve in stead. Now I have a holy priest on a pvp server that is dominated by the other faction.
---
I don't mind pvp, but I do mind getting ganked so much that I can't get anything done anymore.
---
TIL.
---
If I saw two items with one literally a copper lower, I’d buy the more expensive one every single time. Do people seriously think a 1c undercut is a good idea? I bet you’d have more sales pricing one copper above and getting spite buys from people like me.
---
I hit a warrior for 4,300, but he was in full wrath/might so it barely did anything to him lol.
---
Why are people shocked about Bolvar losing so easily. He doesn't have Frostmourn!
---
Not sure if there's a missing /s tag or you're just this big of a fanboy, but Blizzard (then Silicon &amp; Synapse) was founded in 1991 and Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans released in 1994.
---
Star Wars was released in 1977.
---
The "World" of Warcraft is a pastiche of SFF, pulp, and pop culture, from Lord of the Rings, to Star Wars, to Indiana Jones, to Lovecraft and much more. One of the more engaging storylines in Classic is a freaking homage to Legend of Zelda.
---
I mean, damn, son.
---
Hell nah. At this point retail is so muddled for me gameplay wise that I only enjoy it for the story. However BFA had a miserable storyline ruining sylvanas who used to be a badass character and the rest of the story just being bland in every other way. As for shadowlands, i don’t want to make a complete judgement without proper information but the trailer really was unremarkable and the fact that sylvanas beat the Lich king and destroyed the helm of domination within 3 minutes with zero effort was just really lazy and garbage storytelling in my opinion.
---
interesting, ty. i tried msbt but it doesn't keep the dmg over the mob and it was bothering me lol.
---
My friend did something like this to me by replacing invis in BC
---
Yeah rift was amazing.
---
My favorite tank of all time is SWTOR Juggernaut though. *Sooo much fucking fun!* even in PvP, surviving and holding off 3-6 players for 60 seconds, waiting on your team to respawn and holding down that point so the other team couldn't cap it!
---
Rift did so many things right. One of the best class systems ever created. That was good times!
---
be careful how you tone your posts, or you'll get spam downvoted by the threat police here and get a speeding ticket
---
I ran golemlord runs 40+ times for second wind and never saw that ring
---
As everyone says its a nope. But inside the key bindings in the default classic ui theres a keybind for dismounting which is by default normally blank. Set yourself a key and do that. If you want to be fancy and cast as soon as you stop do the dismount key in the air while jumping and you'll maintain mounted speed til you hit the ground and the global cooldown from dismounting will likely be over when you hit the ground so you're absolutely ready for whatever.
---
"1 hour runs in Molten Core"
---
Damn... I was happy with our 3 hour run
---
imagine if every single person who hit 60 posted it on this sub
---
You don't need claw+bite.  Cower is rubbish.  Dash is useful sometimes, growl is the most important pet skill outside of instances.
---
You should have bite/claw on auto.  Growl on auto if questing or solo.  Dash use on demand when useful
---
Unless it’s a tech startup that’s about to go global and has a pingpong table in the break room along with optional leave for when you need to go protest something.
---
those guildies are the toxic ones probably under-performing and wasting everybody else's times
---
Heheh, everyone says that, but I found it to be the most readable I found after many, more ordinary, attempts
---
You get to press 4 buttons in any given order and autowin every matchup.
---
This is your new build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/25003000505-23451010513051
---
That is as deep as you ever need to go in BM.
---
Your pet will also do 1/3 of your damage with this build.
---
BT does out DPS all other pets. I've tested this extensively. Any cat 1.3 or faster is sufficient though.
---
DM:E Jump runs with 1 healer &amp; 1 DPS
---
Out of the loop. Just hit lv40. Can someone explain the stress around phase 2?
---
Michael Garrett... the only flight master whose name I remember for this exact reason.
---
Yea
---
Same! Saw it a week or so ago.. now I’ll never forget it
---
Ninja-ing isn't considered griefing and isn't a bannable offense
---
Stones are underrated
---
Really dont need to bind them all, can use an addon like Sammys totem timers but also I use;
---
123456qerftv then alt and shift of these.
---
Then mouse buttons, click wheel, click wheel sideways, side mb, mb4,5 then I have a numpad on the side. Basically the way I originally did it which does not require a big mouse like i have is get sammys, keybind to cntrl 1-5. Then have tremor, earthbind and grounding as individual ones (3,t and 5 for me) as they are the useful react totems.
---
You ever see it in either of your hands?
---
Is the difference between a fresh 60 and a Molten core geared 60 really that great? I thought the MC geared guy would only be like 10% stronger...?
---
I assume being a less gear dependent class would help with this? A gear independent class could still beat a raid geared class right?
---
Okay thanks for the advice
---
What does BRM stand for?
---
Unfortunate. Try downloading more ram that should help
---
Cya
---
Free dodge is nice, not like a level 19 has many options.
---
Uh what
---
You mean unbridled fury the tier 2 tree of fury spec
---
The talent that gives you a 40% chance to generate 1 range when you deal melee damage.
---
That's the ground you're going to stand on to claim why fury is better to tank
---
Cause that's the only thing that gives rage without taking damage or doing damage
---
And the only time I find myself rage starved as a tank is when dps dont attack the same target or the marked target. Or I'm pulling around the corner and they think it's okay to start dps.
---
I bet you anything that's the same reason why your deep prot pug tanks seemed so bad. 
---
You probably didn't wait for them to set up position or you attacked the wrong target
---
What if I told you a character could grow in power without wielding the one and only artifact, like ashbinger, and still be unique and loved by you?
---
We’re stuck thinking it’s one way or the other, when in reality it’s possible to curve power and story without ever fighting the gods..
---
Problem with prot pally is not having taunt and needing to drink after every pull.
---
Seen tons of Orbs reserved groups, I've actually ran quite a few on my alt mage.
---
That's just an urban legend
---
Nothing really right now, but in phase 3, enchanters want/need the 1h agility enchant.

1. It's two headed ogre not two spined ogre
---
2. this is a low effort post. you know this is a low effort post. you just want the karma.
---
Hunters are the too tier 19 twink. Its a known fact in the scene.
---
Well moonkins are gems that need to be cherished
---
This is exactly how it's supposed to work lol 
---
And it's a lot less effort and more profitable to buy/resell than scream at some rando.
---
That's why I prefer BC as far as story goes WoTLK was great but pretty much ToC was the full turning point for WoW to be on the path to become retail.
---
i just give fort to everyone jumping off
---
Just spot on
---
Ideally you’d have a miner and an herbalist for this
---
if he just did the stealth to his chair it wouldve been mostly ok...
---
It’s a disease cure. Only PvP application is to remove Devouring Plague.
---
This is the answer
---
Gave it the ole ele shaman try.
---
30 minutes = 3.5g trash, 2 mithril nodes (1g on my server), 18 of those AH body parts, 4 scorpid blood.
---
The AH on my server is incredibly bare for the bodyparts, I'm pretty doubtful they actually sell. There's also 89 auctions by one person for a whopping 75s on one of them.
---
If the parts sell for 75s a piece (most prices are hanging in the 80s - tax), that's 18g. Scorpid blood sells for vendor historically. Judging off the AH, I really doubt I could sell them as fast as I could farm them if I was putting in just 30m a day even. Especially since I see one person with 30 of one body part and 89 of another which clearly aren't selling well.
---
Very economy based. I'm always wary of generic guides based off AH only.
---
Yeah what the other guy said. Strafe at a slight curve or jump as you go back side to side diagonally
---
That isnt true.
---
Herbalism isnt 100% necessary. Sure you would get the nodes on the way, but clearing for nodes will decrease your GPH.  But yes, mining is a must have.
---
I’ll watch story stuff on YouTube that’s it.
---
HEY HEY HEY ITS NO NUT NOVEMBER
---
This but only you and a healer
---
whats a better name for a warrior dwarf, Stacked or Mutton?
---
&gt;What a toxic bunch of gamers
---
You need some self reflection buddy.
---
BRD and Spire have enough content to get you to 60 if you really grind it man.  I basically did 48-60 in only dungeons to grind BiS gear.
---
You can’t. But if you have a friend come over and try while your looting he has the same chance as the griefer
---
Warrior.  Nobody will fuck with you while levelling because they know they can't kill one of you without being killed by the other.  
---
Something about this combo.  People see the mage and come to gank, see he's got a warrior friend and suddenly they are just walking here, minding their own business.  
---
At least, this was my experience
---
Devilsaur is a competitive farm, it’s something you just have to live with or find another way of making gold if it’s not for you
---
I was going to level to 60, but then I got high
---
I think there are some interesting points, but of course everything is subject to change until release. 
---
I like that there's AP/equivalent grind, selecting stats when crafting gear, the new customisation options look promising. Covenants and class talents seem ok, but I think there will definitely be 'bis' abilities for certain classes. It also looks like it will be very alt-friendly (akin to being able to do WQs and Suramar straight away, assuming you've done all content prior).
---
However, the main drawback is that I don't really care about any of it - my characters haven't felt like part of the world since Pandaria. Basically, ever since we became THE CHOSEN ONE.
---
And that, I think, is Blizzard's biggest flaw in the last few expansions. Of course there are a lot of little things such as how this-and-that was handled, but natural side-effect of garrisons, class halls and leading faction war efforts has made us just too damn world-shaking. One of the great things about Classic is that we're just another mage from Elwynn, or a student of druidism from Teldrassil, so on and so forth. Since Cata launched we started saving the world from global threats, we were made CHAMPIONS, and it all kinda went shit from there.
---
Rolled my first Undead over the weekend and spent 30 minutes trying to find the mail box. Even asked where it was in city chat a couple times....gave up and just ran to Brill.
---
Lmao I bet it makes them money. Like next to nothing but I also think nobody has ever quit over multiboxers.
---
I have seen 2 in the game so far and not once did I think it was unfair.
---
Just take a peek in the post history..
---
Agreed. The herbs would be a couple extra g here and there which can add up over time, but you’re really there for the RTVs.
---
Right now (in phase 1) there are almost no in game incentives for an enemy player to kill you. When phase 2 releases, enemy players will get an “honorable kill” if they kill you. As you get more of these types of kills you unlock different pvp ranks for your character. There are in game rewards associated with each pvp rank. 
---
In phase two there will also not be any battle grounds, so a lot of people are expecting world pvp to increase substantially as players aim to obtain pvp rewards from getting honorable kills.
---
Ohh so that’s where my briarwood reed that I got today *-waits for the applause to die down-* went when I equipped it
---
It’s not retail vs classic. It’s private server vs classic
---
Illegal is a fairly flexible term. TOS is a contract, and breaching a contract is "illegal" (and could be found so in a civil action) even if it is not criminal. Source - am lawyer
---
Speed and crit work together. The more shots you fire = more potential crits
---
He's gotta feel big somewhere I guess
---
Once I'm 60 I'll be there too grob mob.
---
I think OP is referring to his old 60%mount(see left side of the pic)
---
Kited this guy from where the poison bottle quest was all the way to Jintha. He'd spawn and attack the elites.
---
Task failed successfully.
---
Why would you? Sunders are ineffecrtive and if tank is good he should be furyprot and spamming heroic strike with bloodthirst and revenge on CD.
---
I dunno man, the more "behind" I get the less it feels there's people around to do things my level. Elite quest? Dungeon nobody needs anymore? They get harder and longer to fill.
---
omg had this in ulda.  i really try not to tank pugs and its this kinda cancer that gets me.  spriest was lowest of the three dps but constantly had a mob in their face.
---
I'm still trying to convince my dad that the game wont give the computer a virus...
---
It's because he's doing it repeatedly, he's probably known on his server for this exact reason.
---
The extra customization and building your character more the way you want it and trying to cut back on such a long leveling system. I know alot of people hate it but being level 120 is kinda lame and discouraging imo. But this is just some things i wanted, maybe they didnt listen to the players but the people at the convention seemed happy for the most part
---
There's a reason PvE realms were more popular in Vanilla. We're about to see (again) why the migration occurred the first time off PvP realms.
---
As someone who rerolled off of Skeram as Ally at level 54 when the ratio was 4:1.... theres 12k items on the alliance auctionhouse, you going to scare off everyone and fuck your AQ chances LOL?
---
I put mine in the bank, never know when/if I want to use it again for any reason
---
You just need the rank the buy them, so yes.
---
They're talking about how he still has 1.3k gold after buying a 900g mount.
---
Usually just bank the basic mount, unless you're really hurting for bank space.
---
The soy mods removed this great meme because they said it was low effort.
---
Classic was perfected years ago by people on private servers, all the information you could ever want exists.
---
&gt;There is no "side rooms".
---
I'm thinking of under the bridge to UBRS.
---
&gt;Protection has built in threat modifiers, additional threat generating abilities and more CC.
---
Arms/Prot or Fury/Prot put at least a few points into Defiance. Shield slam is nice but is a 6 second cooldown. Concussive blow is nice but bad tanks aren't likely to use it in the first place.
---
&gt;It's not magic to have baseline better tools to do the job.
---
Bad tanks aren't likely to use them though. Prot can spam sunder but most bad tanks I see will just spam it on one target while not noticing there are mobs on the healer.
---
There are situations where the graveyards can be camped as well
---
No
---
It takes a lot of commitment. Made champion on horde and have no clue how i ever did it on a very populated server at the time.  Best advice is if you really want to do it find a pre made group. I never did but it would have been so much easier.
---
Yeah. Once you get viskag, brutality blade should go in offhand, but you can use mirahs until then.
---
Yeah uh.. You should try it, and maybe get your head out of your ass as well.
---
there are paths on the mountain surrounding Sun Rock to the west as well
---
Dude wtf. Just hit print screen on your computer. It’s 2019 for gods sake. I am so offended right now you just ruined my god damn night with your crappy little picture. I mean grats on 60 but all you gotta do is hit print screen. People like you should be locked up. How dare you. Did I tell you to hit print screen? Damnit.
---
Pretty sure he implied that the lvl 3 with loads of gold to spend probably has a main.
---
Allows you to DE soulbound items.  Change to a crafting profession at 60
---
Yeah sure. Problem is the items are higely overbuffed for p1. That's one reason everything is so damn broken and why we can do Rag presons without proper gear.
---
I understand why they do it and i wouldnt do it otherwhise. But still, it's not for the best, only to fullfill a goal that was never even met to begin with.
---
Not against enh shaman, destroyed so many warlocks leveling up!
---
But...isn't asking for more why Classic WoW exists in the first place? People wanted it? Personally, I don't give a shit if they do all of them, if people demonstrably want them.
---
When it comes to making gold faction lines are blurred. If you want to take the righteous path that’s on you man, and to be frank it’s a good thing, but you have to understand, which I think you do, that these guys taking your skins won’t get them banned and it shouldn’t ever get them banned. 
---
However if they take it further then emoting at you and begin to become abusive in whispers or any other chat, that’s another story and perhaps a solution to your problem, if you catch my drift.
---
&gt;and you're over there rolling on a hunters BiS ranged weapon as a rogue or warrior
---
Well, well, well, how the turntables...
---
Sit at thorium point Tues Wed Thurs nights with a few friends imo.
---
There is actually more for tanks in Scholo than most dungeons except BRD/UBRS. The issue is that Scholo is just annoying to tank due to the LOS pulls.
---
You can, he is wrong
---
 She has the power of death powering her. Thats why she beat him so easily..  it all ties into a bigger picture mang
---
This pug MC shit and fast runs and speed leveling...these actions are all part of a world/community that I actually don’t want to be a part of lol so I’m excited for me and my low level homies to start banding together and establishing our own collective pace. Taking video games seriously just feels so weird to me. It makes me feel like I’m misunderstanding what I’m doing lol (playing a virtual game).
---
100% correct
---
I don’t know what that reference is, pls explain.
---
https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/vaginas-101
---
the vaginal canal is a word used to describe exactly what he is talking about ... also called the vaginal lumens. so maybe you need to check your sex ed facts...?
---
What if I told you my characters strength was from the journey of vanilla through BFA and not from an artifact from a single expansion?
---
If you want to talk about the story issues from a Specific expansion, that’s fine, but that’s not what I’m talking about when I’m talking about my characters growth and strength.
---
My group spent almost an hour trying to get from Thorium Point to BRD instance. It was horrible. People camping the FP. Then after 2 deaths(?) you get a rez cooldown and it increases... one guy said fuck this and logged so we had to find another person. 
---
The moment you rez, you get maybe a few meters ahead and instantly die to geared 60s. It was really rough and not fun at all. I know people will just say "then roll PVE". 
---
But the thing is, I did roll PVE before. I have a level 60 pre-raid bis geared warrior on Remulos. I'm in OCE and there's literally no guild that raids at my  GMT+8 timezone. Everyone is raiding when I'm still at work. Its quite 'dead' for me. 
---
That's why I'm forced to play on PVP if I want to raid at my timezone.
---
If you arent averse to following the rules, and being kind to the freaks (like me, just not a wow RPer :p and mods... it's a joke lol), RP servers are great for community and tend to be well populated.
---
If you dont want to deal with that, it's really hard to tell. Unlike vanilla lifespan, classic is far more populated by the endgamers. Lots of former observer and retail raider/pvp types. I've noticed population is pretty low outside peak. More so than retail was
---
Seems like they are having fun with the game. To each their own!
---
This is illegal.
---
Yeah I see the shaman tag now my bad on that
---
But that tells me you dont have much insight as a dps or a tank.
---
I have insight on all 3 specs over my 15yrs of playing the game I played a hpally for 10yrs
---
Dps need to attack one target at the start of a pull. In big aoe pulls i encourage dps to start aoe when the primary target is at 50% hp
---
It's the tanks job to make sure mobs dont attack the healers. Because healers cant really control when and when they need to heal.
---
Dps are required to keep their threat in check so they dont pull off tank and thus the healer will pull off them. Which why theres auto attack and auto wanding.
---
And yes theres no such thing as perfect groups which is why tanks have taunt, mocking blow, commanding shout. And other incredibly high threat gens abilities such as sunder armor and shield slam (shield slam also removes magical buffs of targets acting as a purge or spell steal)

Old times

Things to escalate quickly when people get fed up with your death squad. 
---
As far as min max type numbers go I’m not 100% sure. All I know is last night my mage got staff on dominance and I intend to use it for its namesake!
---
Take 10 days out and roll on a pve server. Level some alts. Not "mostly everyone" is 60 and on their 3rd and 4th alts, that's just blatantly wrong. The endgame is still progressing, this is just the warmup, in addition to that, phase 2 is real soon. Find a different endgame than farming materials or doing raids, or don't and play a different game

I think you are trying to change the subject because you know you can't defend the key issue, which is that twinkers are gutless griefers who prey on newbies, spoil battlegrounds, run away from real fights and lie all the time.
---
The thing with geared people at level cap is they didn't make a deliberate choice to insert themselves into battlegrounds that they don't belong in. A 19 twink is equivalent to a decently geared 25, and twinking is just a way of getting into a 10-19 battleground with a level 25 toon so you have a huge advantage and can win without needing skill or effort.
---
As a hunter, what is better?
---
Peacemaker or Bone Slicing Hatchet x 2 
---
Considerations with and without enchants?
---
Enchants even worth it? I have both options currently
---
just because you can ride faster than me, does that mean you can kill me?  
---
The only thing the mount would do is help me to run away faster, but I don't run I fight to the death so that means its about catching the other guy who is running from me.  
---
Ok maybe Im starting to see your point.  Still not buying my epic mount before lionsheart tho.
---
This is the only correct answer
---
Curious,  how do you get the data? I think I'm a bit dumb
---
I figured this out in 2004. I'm a little shocked at some of the replies to this thread.
---
I’m sorry you feel that way about your characters.  I’m glad I dont.
---
dang
---
I'm colorblind... lol
---
Same here. I don't even have the time to sit there and keep my stuff for sale for days. It's a lot easier to just undercut and get the stuff sold fast.
---
This is just the story of classic. Whoever makes the first move wins.

Get the necro cloth set for PvP. Insane amount of stam, int, and good set bonuses. All farmed from scholo.

---
Lololoo
---
Thanks for advice :) ! Yeah i did bind these keys i just thought i wasnt that useful with 4 wolves biting my butt x)
---
Necro set 100%
---
They had 1hr+ queue times because almost no twinkers wanted to play against teams of enemy twinkers.
---
They all pretended that what they wanted more than anything else was endless 10 twink versus 10 twink games where their skills could truly shine, until they got that option. Then they all logged off, never to be seen again.
---
Then came back shortly afterwards with endgame enchants on heirloom gear and disposable toons, that they griefed newbies with until they dinged 20 and then deleted.
---
You don't think design affect money in a significant way? Microtransactions is design.
---
Ghaha great :p
---
I know it's on the southwest corner and I still run around the circle a few times
---
Yeah like if it’s normal xd retail really lose all the social parts of the game
---
Sounds like 5 hits.
---
wosh
---
Tanks don't just provide a threat ceiling, they're also providing mitigation so they don't die.
---
They need to balance threat with mitigation and therefore sometimes the dps needs to slow the fuck down and wait.
---
If a tank ain't offering enough threat, there is absolutely nothing they can do at that moment to stop a dps from out threating them. They might have got unlucky, they might have stuffed their rotation, they might be undergeared, but at that moment they can't do shit.
---
Dps though, can pay attention to their threat meter and slow down. It's not a big ask.
---
If you're in a hardcore raiding guild it's unlikely to matter, but in pugs and casual guilss, you have to be adaptable.
---
Pretty much. Then just get anything with high stam &gt; int &gt; spell power .
---
Look for the giant bat 🦇rings on the back of the flight masters alcove— can’t miss em and they’re way easier to look for than the often obscured NPC.
---
lvl42, never played wow before classic, don't know what any of these comments mean, i don't even fully understand what a raid is, apparently screwed, don't care. I'm having fun doing my own thing at my own pace, and literally every day i play i play with others that have never played and we figure it out along the way. I'll continue doing that.
---
Well it’s really hard to get for me i sometimes use it for no reason and have to wait 30min for it, here i thought using it against 3 wolves would be useless because my health was already at half of it :)
---
Notice the how the mounts are off to the edge of the picture 
---
And the focus seems to draw attention to his currency

Lol the biggest fantasy world ever written wh?

Holy shit i've been playing this game for fifteen years
---
I am kind of amused that shadowlands is launching so soon after FF14's latest vaguely similarly themed (and very loved) expac. 
---
It looks like I would enjoy the story, but I am so out of the loop, and my computer is such a fucking potato that I have no real interest in going back to retail.

Poor guy must think 1300 is alot of gold
---
Excellent. I had farmed Scholo a whole bunch and I think I'm only missing maybe 1 piece of that. 
---
Thank you both for the advice!
---
Toujours rester friendly xD
---
Totems... seriously, what kind of stupid decision was it to nix totems.
---
Mostly depends on your DPS to your tank's ability to generate threat (pedantic, but, basically true) a well geared and experienced tank won't need much of a head start, while an undergeared or inexperienced tank could easily need you to wait for 3+ sunders.
---
Horde: Where the models have nostrils big enough to breathe through.
---
The airport where I live is in the southern part of the city. That is the only way I can remember it. Mailbox is directly across from it.
---
You are miss understanding his point.
---
They are not telling you how to design gear or daily quests.
---
They are telling the designers to increase profit and make players spend more time in game. They do not care how you achieve that, but you have to achieve this KPI by the next quarter. That is how they "give" input
---
And look at how much more busy work there is in game since WoD, don't tell me they were put in to make the game a better place.
---
I only use bartender4 to move everything on the screen as i want :D !
---
Shadowlands is basically the countdown when Classic comes to an end.
---
Just reach out to the alliance on your server and have them killed repeatedly.
---
I sure hope so.
---
&gt; This is the most old man rambling obnoxious post I've read in a real long time.
---
The fact that I've had both this response as well as positive ones, tells me that both responses actually say a lot more about the people writing them, than they do about me.
---
I can also accept being called an old man rambling, from the point of view that yes, Zoomers and I fundamentally do come from two different realities; and believe me when I say that I wish for my own sake, that I could go back to mine.  I don't want to associate with Generations Y or Z, any more than they do with me.
---
worth noting you actually understand why blizzards games are successful and what makes a successful game. a lot of the time the shareholders have no idea what makes a successful game
---
Assuming you are an in demand class you’ll get a guild and if not you’ll struggle just the same at this point, regardless if you hit 60 today or in 6 months from now.
---
Getting into a guild late means you won’t be prio in high in demand items like azuresong mageblade or BRE but then again due to loot council rules (99% of the time an excuse to loot whore) neither will most people anyway. What it does mean however is that everyone already has their tier pieces so you can get a full set of t1 and 2 pieces of T2 fast as heck when other people have been spending hundreds if not thousands of gold in consumes to get that gear.
---
You can always look for the big rings hanging in the spot where the flightmaster is.
---
I don't really like how story is going and first time ever cinematic didn't fill me with excitement. Lore just seems very absurd. But I really do like their design philosophy after watching all panels. I think if they manage to pull this off and keep that course, it will change WoW to be much better game.
---
If I am being honest though, mages that are specced right have low threat. I start casting and time right so it hits right after the first sunder (Second if he charged in or had rage to double sunder), and I have NEVER pulled off.
---
Wait. They are literally removing world questing as an option to level? I didn’t read that. Source?
---
It's a hunter, so would make sense. Don't know much about twinking but I'd suspect aspect of the cheetah would be cool to have as a twink.

I recommend flying to burning steppes and taking the back entrance in.

Every bloody time
---
Private servers helped add to the foundation that had already been set in vanilla. But, as we've discovered, had a lot of information either wrong or incomplete.
---
So while it has definitely been helpful, "perfected" is not an accurate description at all.
---
“Build me a car” 
---
Ok well I guess that guy helped us build the car!
---
I’m not misunderstanding anything — your, and his point, is terrible.
---
I kept telling people SP is overrated but got downvotes. It’s because 99% of the people here have no clue and just mindlessly reiterate dumb shit they’ve heard.
---
If you happen to be a NEET who is at the computer 24/7, and you are listing items with no listing cost (like enchant mats), there's no reason not to hover, sweating, over your keyboard undercutting by 1c every time. As often as it takes so that you are the lowest undercutter for 99% of the day.
---
But if you want to put up an auction, log off for a day and come back to some money, you don't want to play the undercutting game against that NEET. You want to undercut so hard that the NEET either buys you out and relists your stuff, or cries because they refuse to undercut you. That is how you win.
---
As a noob I always thought purple amulet of glory was the ultamite sign of wealth.
---
The Ogre Magi stuff is what I have right now. I've been wondering if I should go for the Dire maul dagger and umbral crystal instead but it seems pretty close honestly.
---
We thought about it. They were there too and I think its worse because when you touch the ramp, you are automatically dismounted forcing you to slowly run up while people shoot you.
---
&gt; I mean, they weren’t even invited to the pvp tournament..
---
You mean the Horde only pvp tournament ?
---
As a noob I always thought the purple necklace was the ultamite sign of wealth.
---
Thanks for your indepth comment! I already have a 46 mage but i got super bored just spamming frost bolt
---
Firemaw. EU?
---
Base mana is what? 2800-3500 mana or something? Afaik it's soemthing like 250-350 mana per cast.
---
I think the opposite would be better, give everyone the option to copy their 60 over to a untouchable classic realm, this way they would funnel everyone who wants classic forever to one realm instead of having the 60 community split between 20 low pop/dead servers. Then they can upgrade the current servers to tbc and make a couple fresh ones/merge dead ones ect 
---
Ofc some people will lose their name but that’s a small price to pay for an everlasting consolidated community.
---
Which has nothing to do with whether or not prot is good, bad players are bad no matter what. But at the end of the day someone that is in prot spec will have an easier time tanking a dungeon.
---
Even for Asmongolds pvp tournament there isn’t a single pally entering/invited.
---
Optimal DPS is only relevant when you are an optimal player playing with other players playing optimally. It isn't not worth considering, but skill and gear are a major factor at almost all phases of play and there's plenty of room for a warlock to be the top DPS in your guild.
---
Where does it start? Near the elemental at the campfire?
---
But he already asked where it was lol

My enh shaman is 35 and I’m to the point where I’ll log in, kill a couple mobs painfully slowly and then realize it’s not fun at all anymore, hearth, and switch to my warlock. It’s sad how slowly mobs die. If you want to speed it up and use your shocks, you’re drinking after every second pull. It’s just not fun like it was up until like 33-34ish
---
There is a ring from strath UD that you get from a simple quest (pick up and turn in at the same npc) straight after killing the last boss, it has good stats. No spell damage but a heap of int and stam. 
---
Cyclopean band from ogre dude in BRD plus the jail quest reward are both really good. Hit belt from the same dude if you need hit. That’s about all I can think of right now. Best of luck!
---
Rolling herod horde* real chads are herod alliance
---
Auto wand doesn't have threat reduction. Don't do that.
---
Shareholders tell you to increase profit. That doesn’t mean they’ve done anything. 
---
A shareholder didn’t come up with micro transactions
---
Has to be. A bit surprised he went rogue this time around.
---
I legit just did a dungeon in retail, I needed to stop for about 10 seconds to change music, dps pulled the entire room and wiped us.
---
Tanking in retail is a fucking rush where dps have 0 patience.
---
Thats breaking the community for me, I want the same server, just clone it and call it "whatever TBC".
---
Well it’s not classic but black ice is a ring that shows
---
Wind fury procs always seem to come when your target is one hit away from death, and you overkill it by like 30% of it’s HP, but it took 35 seconds to get the enemy that low. It’s agonizing
---
I tested mortar recently and it does not share a CD with sapper or nades. Mortar into sapper can get over a thousand damage to a group of people.
---
Ya STV and hillsbrad are a nightmare

I just wanted to slow them with Hamstring !!! D:

Also the room with the 3 elevators and 2 paths out to ruins, the paths out are the north ones
---
Cheers. Will keep that in mind 😊
---
Haha wow you are so clever, no wonder you play Alliance.
---
Agreed, but I think it adds such a sense of scale to them that it works. Having to wander around for a while to get from point a to b in the city and it taking real time to get around can be annoying, but it makes it feel like real cities.
---
Most humble brag ever.
---
That actually is reportable. So report it.
---
This reads like a DJT tweet lol
---
So you did a lvl 52 dungeon as a 60 congratz
---
I'll be bored with classic by the time it comes out. I'll check it out. They are taking from classic and adding to retail.
---
Mooncloth cd would probably be the biggest.

Wtf, its obviously a ring on a string. Like Frodo had you know... Its what I've always seen.

It's still 1% with talent I get a few a day with it

You can easily do arena runs at 52

I think it's sadder to look through a random dudes post history to come to a conclusion about who he is as a person.

It doesn't get people mad, it just sounds juvenile and you can just picture the red-faced, A. D. D riddled, edglord behind the computer.

When people say "cuck" anymore I mostly just chuckle at how frustrated they must be
---
So cool... i see 2 assholes... such wow.  
---
Such mature..
---
This guy gets it.
---
Nah not true watch zero do them he's around 10min most runs. Just have to be good. Mine are 15min but it's hard to zone the caster and drain it's mana at the end perfectly while doing max damage on king.
---
You'll always be able to find a guild regardless of class but you'll have to progress with that guild with certain classes and if you're unlucky that might be a bad experience, as a lock i've seen a few guilds that  already cleared 10/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia looking for 1 or 2 locks to join their core roster while the ones looking for a Rogue are usually guilds that are also looking for everything else because they're just now getting started or they're making their 2, 3 or 4 core group.
---
Gnomes, no question.
---
Yeah that's out of bounds, report and watch the magic happen, they act real fast on shit like this.
---
Not a teenager, and I highly doubt that other guy was either considering we are on a classic wow subreddit :)
---
The rank points decay, the most you can gain is 13000 RP I believe, which is what you get for being top 3% or whatever of honor gained for the week.
---
Now rank 14 is 60,000 RP and decay is 20%. So let's say you got 50,000 RP (rank 12) and want to reach rank 14. This is assuming you place at the very top of the servers honor gained for every week in succession.
---
Week 1: 50,000 + 13,000 - 50,000 \* 0.2 = 53,000
---
Week 2: 53,000 + 13,000 - 53,000 \* 0.2 = 55,400 (rank 13)
---
week 3: 55,400 + 13,000 - 55,400 \* 0.2 = 57,320
---
week 4: ... = 58856
---
week 5: ... = 60084 (rank 14)
---
So from rank 12, being the highest percentile of honor earned, is still 5 weeks to reach 14.
---
In reality most people earn way less than the full 13,000 RP, thus you can quickly see the decay becomes a nightmare. Lets say you place above average and get 9,000 RP a week, how does the last week look like?
---
Week 5 (58856RP gaining 9000 RP): 58856 + 9000 - 58856 \* 0.2 = 56084
---
Now you lost rank points (from 58856 to 56084) cause you werent high enough in honor gained.
---
It's a hell of a grind. I might have done a few errors, but this is the gist of it.
---
Its even easier, there is a /script makro that permanently buy the item on pos X closes your Vendor windows what you activate once, then just spam one button for interact at all
---
Would you rather judge a person from one statement?
---
How could she take out the lich king!
---
You mean a much weaker lich king. Sylvanas almost killed arthas before. Followed by illidan putting up a good fight against arthas. And arthas as the lich king was powerful. Bolavar isnt all that powerful compared to when arthas took the crown 
---
It makes sense sylvanas could mess up the lich king. It makes sense that someone in the shadow lands told her what to do and is lending her power. 
---
I'll try it out. Seems fun but we will see.
---
I finally started to learn the cities, But coming from alliance they are mess and the maps are almost useless.

Dang, that was my mnemonic. I wonder if someone else thought of it, or if the post was from someone who heard me talking about it on Trade chat.

Where do you rank in the totem pole of that "dev house"? Would you really know if the investors did try to change something from within? Why do you think that your one experience matters when there are countless ex-blizzard devs who left because they didn't like how much the company started catering to the suits and keeping up profit margins?

Keep hypnotic blade, orb of forgotten seer for dungeons.
---
Keep resurgence rod for leveling or for dungeon fights you know you will oom on- you can change weapons mid fight even.

Ring of subtlety for sure keep, and probably woodseed hop but you'll want to swap that out sooner when you find something good.

Int/stam/mp5 for leveling, spell power/+healing and mp5 for dungeons

Rank 10 with two hours a day? I mean you can get it like that but it'll take ages.
---
Shareholder tells you "increase profit". Lootboxes and ingame-currency is the easiest way to make profits. If you don't see how one leads to the other then I'm getting suspicions that you might actually be the janitor at that "dev house" of yours.
---
Shamans do pretty well in PvP. You can heal as one but elemental is even better and enh. Isnt bad either. 
---
Because shamans wear mail they definitely shine in PvP. Especially once they got some good caster mail in raids.
---
ive pretty much tanked all instances levelling up my warrior..
---
i understand why dps warriors exist, having been able to DPS at 60. its soooo much fun just sitting zerker stances and constantly pressing buttons that make big numbers pop up. 
---
tanking is fun in its own way, especially with guildies or friends in a call. but holy shit it's miserable with pugs. it's easy, sure, but still awful because no matter how well your rotation is you're not keeping aggro off the two rogues opening 1 second in with ambush on different targets while a lock spams shadowbolts on the skull.
---
In open world I usually have succubus out, and I bait wotf with seduce. If I have felhunter out I'm usually in a situation where I'm already expecting pvp, and am not as likely to be caught off-guard by a rogue. Being human with perception helps in this case though.
---
I want to say the difference you see is that the mage's one is pretty visually pleasing with the blue and red and thematically fits the mage, while this one just kinda looks dark and murky?
---
Hey as long as you enjoy it, fucking rock it. After all, you're the one staring at it for hundreds of hours, not us.

Tribute runs work by leaving bosses alive. The more you leave alive, the more stuff you get

To be fair, asking in-game does help fuel the community, and thats part of playing the game

Still just morning here, but worst attempt of the day. 0/10

Idk — where would you consider direct shareholder presentations, working directly with the ceo of our clients, meeting with men who have enough money to purchase most of us if they want on the “totem pole”?

You see, this is a classic “I don’t understand, but I want to seem right”

Have people left because blizzard is chasing profits? I don’t doubt it, turnover in corporations is pretty common. But you guys are vastly misplacing your anger.

Small flame sacs are used in a lot of potions, fire resist and fire breath food i think. They can also drop welp pets.

I feel like people forget that this is all imaginary money lol.  Had a similar experience with a dude spazzing on me for posting like 4 bags with like a 2s undercut (undercut was a determined % undercut by an addon).  I love the whole argument of "ruining the economy" as if a single sale, or group of sales, made over the course of a few hours makes any difference on the longterm value of that item(s).
---
That’s cause it was a Horde tournament.
---
Ooooh jeeezuss
---
Stv on kromkrush is a war zone horde stays dominating the zone tho thankfully

I think janitor would be too kind for you.

They are gonna join Classic and Shadowlands in the expansion after because the level cap will be reset to 60 in SL.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the WoW Auction House.

Garrisons and Class halls, plus gold world quests near the end of legion added a shitton of gold. I had an army of alts with maxed class halls and parked em in Argus to do the 2k gold quests whenever they popped up.

Reminds me of the time I was heading to hinterlands and saw a level 30 something warrior running from his life from cyclonian. Hoped off my mount killed the mob in like 5 seconds /saluted him and carried on my way. Dude wrote out like a paragraph long thank you message me to me about how the weapon was such an upgrade and hed been trying to kill him for an hour etc. Made me feel good was a good day for everyone.

You're probably right but It is entirely possible for some classes to fight lvl 60 chars once you're 55+
---
70-80% of those are horde.
---
For a casual guild, coordinating the head turnin takes more time than you save by getting the buff. It looks good on wowlogs, sure, but that's only because that doesn't count the time waiting in SW and flying to MC.
---
Yank sharply and voila, they're ordinary rings!
---
seems like you are the one who's dumb, what they said still is true, you thinking they should've said ''soon'' doesn't matter late 2019 is late 2019
---
notice in the login menu at the bottom it is 1.13....wait what? i thought this was based on 1.12 ;-)
---
People understand the game more. Lol
---
Same, it resembled the starting backpack icon.
---
True that, I don't understand warriors unwilling to tank either. Especially when I'm not playing my warrior main but my shaman healer alt...
---
We don't need Bliz employees approval to have an interesting discussion
---
Atleast mages can craft an OP chest an be done with it.
---
Not even for a second
---
I absolutely love the setting. Planescape is one of my favorite fantasy settings and they appear to be borrowing heavily from it. Other than Ulduar and Argus, I don't think I've wanted to outright go exploring in Warcraft as much as I do for this. 
---
Torghast is also interesting; it's a low floor/high ceiling proposition, no pun intended. It could end up turning into something players wear out after two weeks (and still have to run for progression), or it could be such a hit that it turns out to be an attraction for roguelike/roguelite fans outside the game. I don't know if they are shooting for the moon in quite that way. That being said, the presentation thus far has been light on new gameplay systems, which does make me think they might be investing significant resources into this new mode. That also means they may not get it right until a while after launch.
---
Otherwise on gameplay systems, I don't anticipate being satisfied. Playing Classic actually reminded me how little some things have changed in 15 years--the auction house, faction design, professions, the trinity of group design. There's finally some AH changes coming (though not nearly enough) and the covenants might be a fresh new look at factions, but I'm still not optimistic on this part of the game overall.
---
I think it only applies for the fair fight part. At least that’s how I perceive it
---
effective HP and threat, not defense nor avoidance
---
you're thinking of live strat which has demonshear and +3 def shoulders.
---
Haha, I know I did.
---
It also makes you stand up when trying to cast while seated. It's great
---
I'm so damn close to picking Shaman. The pvp was the only aspect turning me off one.
---
I’ll probably try it out for a month or so before quitting like the last couple of expansions
---
Undercut more  for slow-moving items the higher the price gets, stuff like stone, cloth, or potions on tuesdays though I just list the same as whoever is lowest, with a lower starting bid so I am higher up
---
You start with the Dragonkin quest in Burning Steppes. Kill the Elite Dragonkins + 10 or 15 whelplings and you will be send to see Marshal Windsor the first time as far as I remember.
---
He is inside BRD in a Prisoncell which you have to get to. Talk to him. He will send you outside again.
---
Go back to BRD and get a note to drop of the elite Mobs. Give this note to Marshal Windsor in his Cell. He will ask you to kill 2 Bosses in BRD for their notes.
---
Go back to Marshal Windsor and escort him out of BRD and his cell.
---
After that you'll have to clear UBRS but only once and after that you are done pretty much.
---
You don’t need to, and tbh unless your a pretty damn good and geared tank, your probably not going to be able to get those deals.
---
Didn't read quest, stood there for 30 mins waiting for echeyakee to spawn, someone else ran up and lo! There was Echeyakee. Not wanting this scrub tonget the rare spawn, I spammed 
---
 my /tar echeyakee /cast charge macro, nabbed it, and killed it. THEN I /DANCED. 
---
I only realized at turn-in that I was meant to summon it with the horn, and that by stealing that person's I basically forced them to repeat the quest as the summoning horn is consumed on use. 
---
I am terrible.
---
Couldn't you camp the area he is summoned at, gank the horde after they summon him then tame him?
---
no? the game should be catered to the people who play it serously
---
a warrior knows another warrior's pain
---
Nope.
---
i have created a special macro, to target and mark him, never missed him again.
---
This
---
I know there's addons that can fix this but I don't wanna be forced into getting addons.
---
Itemrack
---
I will try out the dk if its good and finally I can play 2h frost again then yeah im gonna play it.
---
Retail is getting Old AV in the new patch.
---
I know which is north and south and I still screw it up. Just like I fall in the slime regularly. Undercity is a major pain.
---
there are way too many "is it a bannable offense" posts lol
---
You can play both.
---
By the time it comes out I'll probably put some time into it. 
---
If it came put tomorrow I'd probably take a classic break to level to 60 then come back to classic.
---
A bunch of noobs doing dumb stuff and dying to mobs.
---
Now you don't have to waste time watching. You are welcome
---
Ah I did not know there was even a trailer for classic
---
Nah, I'd like to stick with the real World of Warcraft.
---
Flight south mailbox north
---
Should one just stack stamina over primary stats?
---
Try AOE farming and ZF spam! I know its cheeky but its definitely the thing to do as a mage
---
I think you can also block it ingame without addon
---
I never understood the appeal of PvP realms. Why subject yourself to constant frustration? The PvE world itself can be frustrating enough sometimes, but playing on a PvP realm adds another layer of opportunity for needless deaths. 
---
But then again I’m one of those guys that when he sees an AFK member of the opposite faction getting attacked by a mob kills the mob. I guess I don’t hate people enough to play PvP.
---
... the hate is real xD
---
Nice1 m8 but you couldn't 1 shot me while I'm bear
---
Speaking as someone whose main is a mage that loves to go ham, these are helpful tips! Thanks!
---
Man you *really* wanted to shoehorn that into conversation huh?
---
Undercutted
---
The whole return to the LK as an issue seems like Retcon to me after WotLK end.
---
I guess the bigger problem is that it felt more like deus ex machina.  
---
I also feel it's not very compelling. Maybe it's because I havent followed BFA or Legion or WoD or Pandaria, but there was nothing about the scenario that made me feel like I should care.  It was just more of OP sylvanas being OP and doing shit with no tension involved.
---
Spent 45 minutes grinding elite ogers in dun modor for a pally class quest item that they don’t drop. 3 different groups. Helped them kill the mobs for the quest there, nothing dropped. So I checked wowhead. Realized I was an idiot and logged off.
---
Everything after wotlk became trash wow imo. I love classic tbc wotlk
---
Looks like an old school horror movie poster.  I love this type of content on WoW Classic and want to try to get a large enough high quality print in a frame for the man cave.  
---
Have just seen you've linked to the artists social media so I'll reach out there!
---
jed trinket drop 5 times out of 20 something runs, lost to 1 ele shaman, 1 mage, 3 priests. mage is ok but fuck the others, especially priests. priests have better options or just same ones which are obtainable very easily meanwhile i have no choice as warlock. it's not even in their bis list. i was so mad to that much waste of time. even worse all those priests were in the guild and they just don't understand.
---
Cleave is a modified version of Auto attack , only global cast was mortal strike
---
Ok, thanks!  Yeah, I picked druid instead of warrior because it seemed like a friendlier option and possibly smoother leveling experience as well.  I haven't leveled either in Classic, just my impressions from reading.
---
This was sort of one of my biggest complaints about Legion and BFA. They lock progress behind a daily or weekly timer and that triggered my to no end. If I want to grind rep to get flying in a zone damnit I should be able to grind until my fingers bleed. or if I want to grind a dungeon to get a piece of gear again... They forced me to get on every day and play for 30 minutes to do my "chores" and then there was nothing else I could do. Thats a load of garbage. 
---
They seem to be removing that kind of gameplay in Shadowlands so im just curious what other people think.
---
What do you use looks interessting
---
In many expansions of WoW the characters snowball so badly that almost no amount of skill will save you if the ilvl differs too much, let alone being even one level below the player you're fighting.
---
I'd argue that vanilla/classic is the most lenient of all in this regard. Ofc this varies a between the classes but a lvl 54+ char can absolutely fight a not too decked lvl 60 char. That would almost never work in most expansions.
---
I bet a preraid bis lvl 60 can do fairly well vs a full mc/onyxia geared char. If you aren't planning on raiding the problem truly begins with BWL and beyond.
---
Filed away, thanks
---
I'll keep playing both. There's not a lot to do in Classic between raids so it's nice to have retail as a fallback.
---
man im so in love with the old talentsystem..
---
i hate the new one..
---
so i will stay in classic
---
Because people buy gold. 
---
Blame them, they are the root cause. 
---
If no one ever bought gold there wouldn’t be anything to advertise.
---
yeha I doubt I could &gt;.&lt;  
---
would need full sunder and x3 stacks of BRE
---
So you recommend not having specific actionbars for specific stances? That’s how I have it originally.
---
Is this you? https://twitter.com/FrvnkLight
---
WoW and Runescape are mentioned several times there, so I think it's you. Doesn't actually look like you are working at a "dev house" at all, tbh.
---
We said that with MoP, WoD, Legion, BFA....it's not going to happen. They call Legion the "best expansion" to date and I think it sucks as much as any of the other.
---
I realized before BFA that Blizzard wants to take WoW in a direction where they can minimize player time investments and maximize player transaction investments. I am not going to be a part of that.
---
Sooooo true!!
---
I started playing right at the end of wotlk so I never really knew "the good ole days" but I can see and understand why everyone feels the way they do. I am loving classic.
---
It's a trap!
---
#norush enjoy the vanilla experience really soak that mailbox search in
---
The MC breaks when they enter the portal.
---
What direction are they taking it that you think is "right"? I'm not trying to be contrary here - legitimately curious which behavior you want to encourage.
---
What did you take serious issue with that they are fixing?
---
Personally, I won't play it more than to log in for the event achievements and log right back out - just on the off chance that it does get better in the future. But I think that the company has some very serious (and at this point, deep-rooted) flaws that make me question even whether I want to play Classic. It has just become another money printing press for Activision and is no longer the passionate-gamers-making-games company that Blizzard was.
---
money.
---
The game itself changed too much to be good for me personally. If you like it, enjoy your time but for me I understood that I only like the old vanilla and BC expansion and wotlk was already not as exciting for me anymore.
---
The only thing which would catch me away from classic would be the release of burning crusade servers. Doing Hyjal, SSC, TK, BT and sunwell was the best time I ever had in WoW.
---
I would not even try it out if they would give shadowlands for free, especially not if I have to pay another 60$ for the expansion. Its not the type of game I enjoy mechanically and content wise.
---
This is exactly why I always just ask the guards right outside the elevator. Easy peasy.
---
I don't always find the UC auction guy, but when I do I've first been for a nice swim in green slime while trying to drop down from the mailbox
---
He never said that BWL will be hard.
---
But you are right. Which doesn't Change the fact that you would still want to do it as time efficient as possible right?
---
i used to do that, but it just ends up taking fooorever to wait for rezzes, replace bitchy DPSes, etc. it also makes the pulls far more dangerous, and as a warrior i need all the gold i can get; dont want to waste money on repair bills due to not having the damage to finish off the hamstrung runner. 
---
but yeah, im pretty liberal about abandoning ship at this point. i usually take the healer with me. just actually left a group because they had the audacity to bitch about an underlevelled healer in brd arena/angerforge farm while they were all sub 54.
---
I never said that about any of those expansions and all of those besides MoP were garbage. MoP wasnt bad it was just okay, I actually had a lot of fun on timeless isle. (The lore seemed good too). I get what youre saying though. Cheers
---
You seriously can't pick up what was put down?  Are you fuckin stupid?
---
Ill enjoy my down votes.
---
Yeah. In one pug we were instructed to only auto/wand DPS in phase 1. Then in phase 2 we were finally allowed to do damage. We also had to stop damage at 43%. But in that time the Mages didn't build up enough threat to get fireballed by Onyxia, so our threat didn't get reset. So when she landed, she first went for a Warlock and then for the Mages. And then the RDPS got blamed for the wipe, yeah right.

---
&gt; Prot: why would you do that to yourself if you can be an unstoppable monster that everyone hates from the bottom of their hearts.
---
Can I fix this to:
---
"**Prot:** He knows he can't win, but he'll make you spend the rest of your life with him, up to old age, brushing each other's hair, as though you two were married and deeply in love, and at the very end of it he'll break your heart and die first. But then you can celebrate, cause he'll respawn and you can do it all over again. Unless you have spells, he can't do much against spells.
---
Well said and fair enough
---
Fear being unbreakable is the most op shit in this game.
---
We have class leaders.
---
We discuss before the raid who wants what. Who Needs what etc. and this is then distributed among us.
---
Sometimes when a couple want the same Thing we roll for it. When something is an upgrade for lets say druids but BIS for priests - priests get priority. But again druids get priority over their BIS.
---
It is very organized and fair to be honest because we are all involved in the process pretty much :)
---
So instead you run around in circles?
---
I think Timeless Isle is the worst idea to ever have surfaced in WoW, even worse than Flying Mounts, LFG/LFR and Artifact Power.
---
Do what you enjoy though, maybe retail is better suited for you.
---
&gt;They seem to be removing that kind of gameplay in Shadowlands
---
I am certainly hopeful. The cynic in me says they'll still keep some bullshit that will annoy me to no end, but I want to believe!
---
Azshara Satyr's licking their lips
---
Now I’m stuck at 50, and I know why!
---
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got hiiiiigh
---
Depends on the realm size and the item. Some stuff has both high demand and high supply. On high pop realms that means a lot of shit gets sold in a day. Some idiots heavily undercutting such products often cause a chain where the price of the item dips well below the market price but you can't really start buying them off either because the supply is high so you won't be able to get rid of your stock then. Sometimes that can make it so that there's no point in selling in that day or even multiple days.
---
Ok
---
Nothing goes over my head.
---
If you don’t read this subreddit 24/7 you miss out on all the running jokes. Thankfully I do. 
---
Looking forward to the next bank manager update.
---
He's above the red entrance
---
Sometimes this works, sometimes it drops threat anyway. Most reliable strategy for most is to stop dps and have a tank pop recklessness. Prot paladins if you have one can also get an inner ate and spam greater blessings at around 42/41% as dps stop and they're guaranteed to draw aggro.
---
I did that.
---
Welcome to wokeality
---
And then the ZG Tailor items that become BiS if you have Tailoring
---
I think making leveling faster is a huge mistake, thats actually one of the things I dislike... but I think the good outweighs the bad.
---
Here's how to enjoy retail. It's a very special secret I'm about to share. You join in at launch. Enjoy the quests (as the quests still have good writing) that are sufficiently disconnected from the main storyline. When a main storyline quest comes up, close your eyes and C-stick your way through; the writing inevitably turns into generic lowest-common-denominator garbage. The moment you find yourself repeating a dungeon, smash that alt+f4 and wait for the next expansion. 
---
I've had an excellent experience with every expansion to date using this method. My "main storyline" ended with Arthas being put out of his misery.
---
In a bit more detail:
---
Your honor total (from kills and bg objectives) in a week is comapred to the honor of all other active PVPers of your faction on the realm. With this, you are put into a certain honor bracket for the week, which awards between 1000 and 14000 rank points for everybody slotted into that bracket. The highest bracket is awarded to 0.1% of players.
---
Additionally, your rank points will decay by 20% of your current total rank points every week. So, your new total is your old total x 0.8 + your weekly gain. This means, the higher rank you get, the better you have to place, just to hold your rank. Rank 14 requires 60000 rank points, rank 13 requires 55000. So just to stay even at rank 13, you must make at least 11000 rank points every week. And that's the big problem with the system, as taking a single week off at a high rank sets you back 3-4 weeks on your journey to rank 14, just due to this decay.

Nice. I bought this off the ah super early in the game for 90g before the economy really blew up and people really knew what recipes had value. I've made my money back 12x in the last 50+ days.  Undeath is 79s. Water ranges from 18.5-21g on any given day.
---
Their guild could be using a silent bid DKP system and he may have easily been the only person bidding any amount of DKP and won the two items.
---
Tell mez, when was the last time you played as DPS as a a shammy on an instance? From what I remember, I always healed, even if I had specced fully into enh.
---
Use thistle tea on cloth/leather wearers ;)
---
Strat live and reserve orbs LUL
---
Cool, thanks. I'd only known about AtlasLoot! Will try
---
Yes it is. I wouldn't play it now, our guild on classic is growing and tanking is so much more fun in classic, but when it comes out people will probably be a bit bored with it. I just hope this time they take their time and find back to their roots: when it's ready
---
Fake news I see some pixels down at the screen resembling an XP bar.
---
I don't see why they don'T do at least a minor change to alleviate the problem.
---
E.g. prevent people from ever losing a rank they've obtained and you've already mitigated a lot of the frustration of this system. It's just as hard to reach rank 14, but at least, you aren't set back 3 weeks, when you don't play a week at rank 13 or all your progress is for naught, if you can't play for a month.
---
While I do agree that the game has become too much of a World of Sylvanas, I do root for her. Now I havent played in a long time (just got 120 on two characters) but I do follow the lore through some youtubers. I think I both like her story and want to watch the retail world burn and for that Sylvanas is great.
---
&gt;It seems like Blizz is taking retail in the right direction and I want to encourage that behavior. 
---
They **said** those things, which sounded great, but they are not delivered yet. It wouldn't be the 1st or the 2nd time that they say some reasonable things in Blizzcon about a new expansion and then it gets nowhere.
---
bro everything you have posted about wow has been super toxic... Honey &gt; Vinegar my guy
---
What s the cap?
---
Slashfour is the add-on you're looking for
---
yeah i thought i was the only one who found it funny lol. seems to be all in good fun. i feel like theyre definitely intentionally being cringe about it. 
---
but eh, im a horde rogue, so maybe im just a piece of shit as well
---
i dont like having to type weapon names nor use bag slot positions so i went with a macro that uses the actionbarbuttons - hope its right from memory, but i can look up the exact code when im home... but i think i did it like this:
---
drag your weapons of choice into actionbar buttons, i used an extra bar with bartender where i changed the alpha a bit and positioned it to my liking. then i looked with /fstack what the names of the specific buttons are.
---
so when you see with /fstack that the name of the button is "BT4BUtton97" then you can use
---
    /click BT4Button97
---
and it equips the weapon you dragged into the Actionbarbutton Number 97 and so on
---
So i would put my three, four, any weapons into buttons and add their /click functions into macros like:
---
for going into stealth and equipping your dagger/offhand:
---
    #showtooltip Stealth
---
    /cast Stealth
---
    /click BT4Button99
---
for casting ambush and equipping the other weapons set use:
---
    #showtooltip Ambush
---
    /cast Ambush
---
    /click BT4Button98
---
i like this because i dont have to edit the macros if i get new weapons, i just have to drag the weapons into the chosen actionbarbuttons
---
5% is in combat. For PvP you either go hemo (no pts in precision), 21-8-22 cb daggers (no pts in precision) or imp sprint prep daggers (2 pts in precision).
---
But yeah 5% is all you need for pvp.
---
I have a skull (with the Baron mace) but I'm struggling to find the best times to use it so it's banked until I'm running flags. When would it be useful in wPVP? I'm finding blinds are easy to predict and polys aren't a problem, is there anything else it helps with?
---
Youre 100% right, which is why I have decided not to pre-order and wait to see what happens on launch before I buy it.
---
Everybody likes big numbers and its nice to a nightfall or two for the offtanks using leather DPS gear as long as they dont tank.
---
Show incoming healing
---
Wrong. Living bomb can crit for 3,4k and without details you don't know shit until you look at the logs, which lets be honest, you don't have either, nor will your raiders be competent enough to look for themselves in the "what happened to me"-tab.
---
dont listen to these guys saying you are cringey nerds. this is funny as hell, you guys keep doing you! theyre just angry alliance that you guys have probably killed, and they will absolutely downvote me for this comment.
---
you sound bitter
---
The MMO market could be HUGE with lots of diverse titles but modern Devs are too scared to take any risk (or held at knife-point by investors/publishers).
---
Safety is the death of art, I wish people would realize they can't take their money to the grave with them and start taking some risks. It would spawn a second golden age of MMOs.
---
Fortune favors the bold.
---
Idk what gph it is but yeah if you have free reign in blasted lands you re making good money (and can easily get your buffs for raid)
---
We all knew this would happen which is one of the big reasons why vanilla will never be recreated. We've all changed and the community changed. People were fucking cunts back then too but this toxic elitist min-maxing cookie-cutter bullshit wasn't as definite then cause we were all new. 
---
Since many expansions ago it is perfectly normal to require players to have better gear than the dungeon/raid drops to get accepted into the group.
---
seriously lol. the amount of crying alliance in this thread is actually hilarious
---
You monster! It honestly depends on what her intention is. In some (maybe a lot) ways she never asked to be put in the situation she is in. Kinda like Garrosh being forced into being Warchief by Thrall and then being blamed for "messing it up"
---
engineering
---
I only played the original 1-60 and tbc 60-70, then didnt play wow in forever. I came back for classic and loving it, but "a new expansion" feels like "i missed too much". 
---
Cba to level 1-150 (or whatever lvl they at), cba to compete with ppl who have reputation for everything, unique items, mounts, lots of gold and are known with the new worldmaps.
---
So yeah, i think shadowlands is ment for ppl who played all expansions and need new content...not all classic players are their target audience i think. I would only be interested if everyone starts fresh and its more like a WoW2 tho.
---
Yeah that's right :)
---
I do not understand what is going on here? Isnt mana per tick related to spirit/mp5 alone and not maximum mana?
---
Which is why I am playing Classic atm. I recently played some of the new cod too but that was also a massive flop. Apparently making a good video game just isnt possible anymore.
---
Where having the biggest group is kinda the only thing that matters
---
I've had a semi terrible BRD run with a completely decked out tank who told me not to banish destroyers because "check my gear". I did.  He was decked out in 5/8 T1 with other mitigation pieces and Quel + Draconian deflector as weapons.
---
Awesome gear right? Yes, for a mitigation tank in MC, but not for a lvl50+ instance where he was rage starved and was losing in threat to everyone and couldn't tank more than one mob. 
---
He never turned the Destroyers around and they happily nuked the whole group to oblivion with fireballs, because his gear was so great, he must have been an awesome tank. 
---
I was hesitating to single target as a crit would get aggro off of him, couldn't multi-dot and heavens forbid any other form of aoe.
---
I came back for 8.3 and am gonna stay for Shadowlands. None of the zones or covenants excited me but as long as the dungeons and raids are good, i'll play
---
We will try to make gold with friends in launch for like 20 days and after that we will return the classic. Trying to make gold with the start of an expansion is the best.
---
Threatplates isn't bad either, if you are melee or someone who can stay in range of the nameplates at least considering they have shoddy range /sigh.
---
Yea true. Frenzy would give it a boost, not a whole lot but a boost. 
---
Still any hunter with BT on a PvP realm come phase 2 and on are gonna just chew up casters and ranks.
---
yes I think so
---
I am also in classic, but honestly.... gameplay in raiding is dull as fawking hell...
---
They change everything about leveling and doing level squish so it's only level 1-60 and you level 60-70% faster.
---
Homework... Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time
---
I just read the [Scorsese article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html) where he says basically the same thing about movies (made in response to him calling the Disney Marvel Movies "Not Cinema")
---
&gt;Many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures. What's not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variation on a finite number of themes.
---
&gt;They are sequels in name but they are remakes in spirit, and everything in them is officially sanction because it can't really be any other way. That's the nature of modern film franchises: market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they're ready for consumption.
---
Companies will continue to pump out endless drivel because it is a *safe* investment and thus stagnate the industry and choke out any opportunity for small visionaries to take risks that could spawn whole new genres or ideas that evolve the medium as a whole.
---
In response to what?
---
doesnt eranikus pull every dragonkin in the instance when aggroed, making farming him annoying and not worth it
---
dude where were you during the whole nostalrius drama? that's the thing that kick started the developpment of classic
---
Very true, I'm only level 44 and not in any rush at all.. besides getting out of STV before P2 so I can focus on new areas without so much PVP.
---
you cant really have it both ways... the comment chain he was replying to was talking about a theoretical level 50 healer lmao
---
He's already got that option activated. He's probably wondering why goldsellers are still a thing.
---
As for the latter - probably because people use them. I have no idea, since there's obviously no official numbers for this. The solution would be Blizzard's official gold-purchasing option from retail, but noone wants that. So if this minor message is all that we have to suffer for this, then I'm perfectly happy.
---
Yes, and whatever the horde version is.
---
The problem with Retail writing is not that it doesn't follow it's story arcs - the problem is it's reliance on "wow effect". Everything is defined not by "what would logically follow for here?" but by "you know would be cool!?" instead. Let's kill one characters, give plot armour and superpowers to other characters, destroys things that everyone thought indestructible, burn cities that everybody love and so on. Everything must have a shock (or at least epic) value to attract attention and potentially more subscribers. And since expansions' stories are self-contained and relatively short it's just twists after twists well beyond twist fatigue. Where is the building up phase? It doesn't exist and replaced with by endless steam of vague foreshadowing to trick people into thinking that next story arc will not come from out of nowhere.
---
The first half of Pandaria was the last time we did something normal. The period of "calm before the storm" is important. It brings back the sense of adventuring after climactic endgames.
---
You could just tank by spamhealing yourself. Only time this goes fubar is when mobs can rupt you :P
---
The new ones will be available?
---
Same issue here. I loved vanilla but I wasn't nearly as hyped as my friends when classic released because I knew I would only enjoy the game if I'd be competitive in pvp. And almost the only way to be that in classic is to raid and I don't have that time. I didn't even log on to classic until two weeks in. Logged on, got completely sucked in and here I am at 59 with no plan whatsoever for 60 :)
---
Any translators?
---
DM: E jump runs, if aren't Fury prot you're gonna have to respec, no reason at all being deep prot unless you have trash gear
---
While im here in a raiding guild did MC 6 times with no loot lol
---
Yeah, why the hell not, I had more fun typing this than playing the game. PvE next?
---
Rly?? I had always thought it was a ring on a string...
---
The tank should put out threat, not damage. That's not the same as many skills have a relatively low damage output while doing a lot of threat. Sunder Armor does 0 damage but a lot of threat while putting a huge debuff on the mob which makes killing him much faster. 
---
The fury/prot build skarm suggests isn't adviseable until a later phase when your healer has most of the gear to keep you alive, basically when the raid is on farm. You need a lot of crit which isn't available in phase 1 yet.
---
Can we get WoW Immortal ASAP
---
Yes but I believe there are cheese methods and/or bursting down the boss quickly. I heard rumors of it being farmed on private servers in quickish times.
---
Just bind stance specific abilities to a macro, like sweeping strikes. 
---
#showtoootip Sweeping Strikes 
---
/cast Battle Stance 
---
/cast Sweeping Strikes
---
yea, I have been looking for this recipe for a while now. But when it's on AH, it's about 1200g, with about 20g profit from a transmute, it's going to take 60 days to make the gold back. I am not sure I think it's worth 1200 gold.
---
Also, I have 36 gold left after getting geared, enchants and mount..
---
I just have to hope that it drops for me one day.
---
It's not until p4 that the bloodvine set becomes available. That being said its bis for dps until late aq and really hard to break. You essentially need full zg, bwl hit items, then leggings of black blizz, volatile power/2.5 robe, 2.5 boots to break without dps loss for mages. Warlocks dont really break it until naxx.
---
Could you inbox me/tell me some tips on how to use logs to improve my own gameplay, and also if I can check for improvements in guild performance, I'm one of three raid leaders in our guild and this could be beneficial when we want to compete for realm first BWL.
---
just look for the ring(s) above in his alcove, also, if you went up the ramp from the bank and you have the mailbox on the right, turn around and go up the other ramp, flightmaster is on the right
---
We have always had them. Back in vanilla too. Same vendor.
---
Dwarf
---
Get epic mount or be everyones bitch lol
---
You can apply that logic to every buff in the game then. Same as consumables.
---
LIES! TIME AND TIME AGAIN blizz just lies or is too incompetent nowadays since wotlk they were chasing the magic dragon. Cataclysm was suppose to be a back to the roots of vanilla expansion, then came mop with modern game design then legion or wod in which they were promising systems and repeatinf themselves every blizzcon.
---
blizzard js nowadays too corporate suffocated or incompetent thats why a game from 2005 is killing their 15 years of extra experiance game, and why poe kills diablo in every aspect except maybe laid back gaming with the gf
---
Are you tryng to tell me there is a spooky spooky skeletons inside of those?!
---
Instructions unclear, now I’m bleeding everywhere and my scrotum is on the floor.
---
And you can drop tailoring until phase 4. Although producing your own mooncloth bags aint too bad.
---
&gt;taking the back entrance
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I use a few but will make more. 
---
I have a macro that will put me in battle stance when overpower procs when I am in berserker. 
---
I also have a macro with a cast sequence that will jump back and forth between stances for the ultimate sweaping strike cleave. 
---
I am also contemplating automating stuff using my macro mouse. Basically let my mouse click buttons for me without me doing it. I just need to get it done basically.
---
It would be super fun if just the "serious" people were on the server wouldn't it?
---
Yeah my one button rotation is starting to get really, really old.
---
DO IT!!
---
Sure they would. They definitely aren't trying to get the cycle done before shadowlands or anything.
---
Many want to PvP, but few want to be PvPed
---
As BWL/AQ release, pugging will get harder and people will have higher demands, forcing you to farm consumeables and shit. That's when it gets tricky. But maybe the increased player skill (in relation to the content) can offset that quite a bit.
---
yeah maybe there would be less bitching, would be nice
---
Shaman question:
---
The way I see it, people either go resto/ele for raid or enh/resto. However, based solely on the talent trees I came up with this build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/25003104003-5025002105-050053](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/25003104003-5025002105-050053)
---
I still pick up the essential hit from the resto tree, but get to pick up both Flurry and Elemental devastation for shock-melee synergy.
---
Gear and abilities, yes. Rotations I think are a bit more.
---
Im just optimistic. Is poe really better? I like diablo but it got boring because they just made me grind the same things 15 seasons in a row. Boring. I might have to give poe a shot.
---
As a resto druid i couldnt find a tank all week for Strat UD to get my healing robe, so i respecced tank. Now i advertise as tank, but reserve the healingrobe... does that make me the bad guy?
---
Flight path and the Mailbox are connected by the bridge. It’s all you need to know.
---
2nd this. I am a lvl 44 undead lock and I have never played another DPS class in Wow or anywhere else. Usually a healer so I have no clue how to DPS.   
---
Im playing a drain tank lock while leveling and I have 0 clue what to do if someone attacks me and I dont manage to fear them.
---
Best means best.
---
As far as PvP is concerned, "best" is subjective. Some people like burst, some people like consistency. The over-all meta and general rule of thumb is you want all the stamina you can get, and then your preferred damage stat.
---
Go to [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com)  click the "items" tab, and filter by leather, stamina and agility, and select sort by stamina. That's your list.
---
No, Shareholders tell Activision to increase profits. Activision comes up with a "model" or a "metric" of what engages people, what sells etc and then they make Blizzard put that into the game. Like, cmon, not really hard to figure this out.
---
Could you give some tips on how to pvp for a lvl 44 drain tank lock?
---
That’s what I’m saying is wrong nothing should be on res! It’s a game of RNG after.... literal rolls of numbers
---
That heavy mouth breathing though...
---
IIRC ice block helps. Not for long though
---
Sure. I never played any expansion for more than a few monthd but i played them all except wod. BC was okay, wotlk till wod was trash, legion was okay for its time (would consider it trash if it released at the same time as wotlk). And bfa was the wordt expansion ever IMO. I enjoyed legion for what it was. Couldnt keep me playing for more than half a year but it was decent. Shadowlands sounds like legion but without all the things i hated in legion. RNG legendaries, class prunning, artifact power. 
---
Ehat i know for dure is that im not gonna play any alts
---
Pretty sure the average group doesn't get submerge either
---
It's a gnomish engineering trinket with a 4 hour cooldown
---
I think many opt for a 30/0/21 ele/resto hybrid - I haven't tried it myself but probably will in the upcoming days. It does put a dent in your mana longevity (as well as missing out on some great single target buffs, %healing and -%thread) but you keep Nature's Swiftness (3 min CD, makes any Nature spell with &lt; 10 sec cast instant) and you have a good chunk of burst/sustained damage via elemental talents - good both for pvp and solo play. 
---
Shamans also have pretty insane utility with the grand variety of totems (most notably Windfury, earthbind, grounding and tremor) and a ranged interrupt on a 6 (!) s CD.
---
Guards cant
---
Most streamers or youtubers are completely out of touch with the average player. All the people I watch suggest that i have to farm thousands of gold and bank a metric shit ton of flasks, potions and grenades for pvp because "you'll use hundreds per day".
---
Eh, sure I'll spam some BGs but who cares if I die here and there and not use engineering to a ridiculous degree.
---
I think they often forget that not everyone can play this game all day every day.
---
Not having tried this solo I have absolutely no idea. It should target the highest threat target, but I do not know how it works in a solo scenario.
---
Tinfoil hat theory (but I kinda think its true):  
---
They will have the opportunity for classic characters to go to the new Retail. And dont do anything with classic at all.  
---
This will have people playing Retail a bit, subs will fall and after a while they release TBC again to see if people are not tired enough of getting milked.
---
If they keep up this publishing rate of phases, they can have Naxx out around august. Just in time for Shadowlands to get in around december.
---
Well, pvp wise you basically have 4 specs available
---
* [Ret-DPS (11/9/31)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505001-0522-052031512203151)
---
  * Similar to a pve spec, just with 2/2 guardians favor, defelction and 2/3 precision
---
  * Most reliable dmg output, but least amount of utility
---
* [Ret-control (0/18/33)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532410003-052051512203151)
---
  * key point is imp HoJ
---
  * Slightly lower damage potential and no consecration, but 35 sec HoJ cd is very nice
---
* [Ret reckoning (0/25/26)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532510003105-05203151220311)
---
  * Similar to ret control, but trades repentance and vengeance for reckoning
---
  * highest burst dmg potential, but hardest to execute, without reckoning stacks you are weaker than the two previous specs and gaining reckoning stacks is not easy, as you aren't much of a threat.
---
* [Holy reckoning (21/27/0) (3 points free)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503101501-0532510003305)
---
  * very defensive spec
---
  * mostly heals, but every once in a while unleashes a reckbomb
---
  * very powerful with good spelldmg gear
---
This is where having a couple of characters comes in handy if you cant get friends or guildies to save you. If someone's camping you still after a couple deaths, i just log onto another character and do a quest or two.
---
I just thinking finding a tank is hard for most groups and this is just my opinion. I don’t think anything should be on res, i ran SM catch over 24 times to get the head piece i wanted... saw many people win it before me. I just think that’s part of the game and reserving stuff is not. I totally get having some guild members come in for a quick run to get you the loot you want. But not in LFG where we all want loot lol
---
Just do tribute runs instead, that boss fight is super easy, i found it harder to learn the pathing of mobs to get there.
---
If you loose aggro to a mage in p1 something went absolutely wrong.
---
I dont usually even have time to play alts. I barely gear 1 character per expansion. Im a super casual player who happens to really enjoy the lore. Classic has been fun but the end game is getting pretty boring for me. I maxed proffesions got a lot of prebis and wanted to start raiding but just kinda lost interest. I have been thinking about leveling another character. idk.  
---
I want shadowlands to be good with every bone in my body.
---
We're on Everlook, the first German PvE realm.
---
I wanted to say it.
---
I'm not quite sure what shoehorning is tbh and I wouldn't say I *really* wanted to. I just wanted to.
---
And since free speech...
---
Done ony 7 times now, haven’t even seen the helmet. You lucky boy
---
But I love gearing up :( don’t take that away from me
---
I want to come back but recently everytime I play retail, I can’t help it. Mainly because of this insane rush mentality.
---
I like dungeons, I just want to chill and enjoy dungeons but you can’t chill in retail even for a second.
---
I was tanking last night and had several wipes because dps just get so impatient.
---
One wipe, I pulled the max the healer could handle, I was dropping to 20% but we all good, then one of the dps pull on purpose 3-4 extra mobs and just wipe us all. 
---
The whole dungeon was like that.
---
Then another dungeon, I needed 2 seconds because I wanted to change music, the dps just went ahead and pulled the entire room and wiped us.
---
It’s just shit, I want to enjoy dungeons but they’re ruined by this super rush mentality where people don’t even enjoy dungeons, they want to get out of them as soon as possible.
---
Sure in classic people want to do dungeons fast but generally people are pretty chill but in retail it’s just gogogogogog pull pull, tanks to slow, I will pull more, gogogo I overpulled and we wiped, fucking healer.
---
Yeah, that's a valid tactic. Alternatively you can use an off tank and have him be at about the 8th spot in threat going into phase 2. With sufficient RDPS he won't get fireballed yet and so he will be one of the first targets when she lands.
---
But don't do the tactic that pug used. That just doesn't work.
---
If you play  comabt rogue you don't even have to open with anyhting but sinister strike.
---
we have exactly one enh shaman in our raid, he wears nightfall and is allowed to stay in pvp spec for raids
---
By having them turn in the head, that's right. 6 hours before you want it dropped. This is what better guilds are doing as there's no other choice. Now you add in multiple guilds and enough care and you'll control the buffs whenever you want to (assuming you can get someone logged on).
---
Overhealing is bad when healers OOM, not otherwise. Sniping someone's heal is (if there's no immediate danger of death) either douchy, bad communication, stupid, or CH jumping where it sees fit. 
---
But I agree, there should be a balance and OH should be taken into account, as people are still apt to OOM (well, this poor shaman with too little mp5, at least).
---
Interesting theory. It makes sense from a business point of view. I wish the morons at the top would realize that the best business strategy for video games is making a good game.
---
You have to know where to rezz and how to do it and how you still get through. You will learn that.
---
It is no rocket science but it depends on the situation.
---
If you are a group use the kit you have. Rezz together, one guy distracts (a rogue or a druid who can always outplay campers, never was camped with my druid in vanilla cause it is not possible to gank a druid if he can count to 5) and the other ones run and use every CC they have.
---
Your goal is not to fight them but get to the entrance. It is a funny minigame how to be smarter than most wannabe gankers.
---
Problem is most people are not getting to the entrance together, guy A is questing there, guy B is sitting on auctions.
---
Sure that is not possible anymore. You have to focus what to do and can't be lazy anymore. Is that a bad thing?
---
Ninja skin? Its not your skin just because you tagged the mobs first. I had a druid try telling me to stop ninja his skin, and i had to tell him. Look dude, i cant cast any spell faster then your moonfire, its instant. I have no ranged instant. You will get the tag 10/10 since we are both spamming the same /target, /cast macro.
---
They are all there to make gold. If you dont want competition do another farm.
---
Possible scenario: after farming 25 devilsaur leather and fighting against his own faction to skin his own kills he said fuck it and did it out of spite.
---
I level up in dungeons anyway
---
Ah yes, playing for min maxing means people must not work
---
I mean its better than khadgar. Somehow he was the center of attention of 2-3 expansions but unlike sylvanas who you're likely only gonna see in cinematics or in a raid that fucking dude was everywhere. Sometimes you would see him after every single loading screen. Doing some quests in the broken shore? Khadgar is there. Found group for kharazhan? Great mive to dalaran. Oh gey khadgar you're here too. Use the tp to the bottom part of dalaran. Khadgar again. Now use the tp to kharazan. Who is there at the entrance? Freaking khadgar. And then we even got a pet that was literally his head floating in a bubble
---
I'm not even born yet
---
If warlocks #1, 2 and 3 all do better damage than you and you have comparable gear, look at what they are doing differently than you and adapt/improve your playstyle. Look at what high-end warlocks do, but keep in mind their gear level and set bonuses which might change how the warlock game is played - pick up tips where you can and where it makes sense. Monkey see, monkey do.
---
It does look like their talking points are moving in a correct direction:
---
1. Removing Infinite AP Grind
---
2. Talking about alts as a reason to play more (This would reduce the need for time gated content since the longevity would be from replayablility)
---
3. Level Squish. Great idea, the new 1-50 options also look good. Alt friendly
---
4. Making professions relevant again.
---
5. Re introducing class defining spells and abilities
---
No I think that's very standard for an mmo, you should strive to improve yourself, if not for you, do it for your teammates.
---
I'm the dedicated tank in my guild. Me and the healer have to be on point all the time, I'm lucky that my other teammates listened to me and are doing their best as well now. When they weren't I told them. And now our dungeon runs are so much smoother. I only play with my guild group now, but if I ever run a dungeon with randoms, I'll hold them to the same standard I do my friends. And if they don't give a shit, why should I? I'll just find another group then.
---
Get rank 14 then you can get as many DHKs as you want xD
---
As many things, people see better players and guilds do it, so they must too.
---
Same
---
Are you comparing an Alliance Raid quest chain that rewards your pvp bis Wand to ridiculous low level civilian quest npcs that no one cares about?
---
*"i have an naive opinion that i want everyone to know about!"*
---
you'll grow up eventually
---
But it's stagnant. I will become bored in a few months. Already I have sometimes trouble finding a goal. And with me there's thousands of others. Stagnant games die.
---
Pservers *had* to reset to keep the base interested. The peeps that just want to play for 8 years in the same stagnant realm are in the minority. There is a reason the biggest pservers are newly opened ones.
---
I started strong, but then got a new job and had to slow down.
---
Do I give a shit? Absolutely not. I'm here for the loooooooong haul
---
hey guys, puknratwiwanovavideahhere
---
I felt sorry for him when he was banned from Twitch for the release weekend but fuck me was it hilarious to hear his 10 minute video bitching and moaning about it. Real victim complex. He'd simply broken the rules and been punished appropriately.
---
If I want to pickpocket BRD to make some gold as a rogue do I have to be spec'd into it? Or can I just use my normal raid combat spec?
---
Well talent trees might be coming back. They are doing a level squish and said that you should get sonething every level because this is an RPG. They might just be talking about getting spells but i doubt it
---
Unless you are ally warlock facing UD - then you get assraped.
---
At the end of the week you get honor based on your standing within your server, whoever gets the most HKs gets the most honor. Unless they change the system for classic, you won't get rank 13+ without grinding 8h+ a day. You can get the blue set by playing much more casually, though.
---
The gear is nice but it's not the end of the world. Rocking a full set of marshal/warlord gear is more of a status symbol, you can compete just fine, especially if you have some good raid gear.
---
And North East mail I guess? I always go to the wrong direction even though i know they're south west/north east so it doesn't help as much as I'd want!
---
What you dont understand is for the most people, this is a game they play in their freetime to just have fun. Not to achieve ranks and shit. You got real life for achievments. Video games are for fun.
---
thanks, so I was doing everything right besides the fact that I never bothered binding seduce ( literally the only spell that I didnt bind ). will just find a spot for it and use it more often on other players!
---
Hurr, one enh shammy wont be enough to provide adequate uptime. 1 will give you like 30 ish %.
---
Hit doesn't fall off for a warrior until around 12-14%, when your mainhand auto-attacks cap out. At that point, you'll be seeing minor gains in fury generation and damage from your offhand attacks.
---
You said it isn’t good, meanwhile in classic people  dungeon farm, spell cleave, melee cleave, have 60 guildies  run their alts through dungeon just to level faster, the irony. 
---
Not trying to defend retail, I also play and enjoy classic, just saying how it is.
---
Okay I know that one, thought there is a actual teleporter like the one in booty bay
---
What about hunters or shamans? Anything interesting?
---
That's fair enough tbh, I play only a few hours a week due to life but I often overlook what my party thinks in favour what I think
---
It's not that accurate but I like to think of average ilvl as your actual level.
---
Someone in full MC gear will have an average ilvl of 66, and if you meet that person as a fresh 60, you're about as fucked as if someone at 54 met a fresh 60.
---
In classic she isn't doing a lot to ruin lore, and in retail she fixed undercity, so which game are you refering to?
---
I am not looking forward to P2 one bit. As if already there isn't that particular guild that's got nothing better to do than waste everyone's time. It's not like I can PvP 3v15. That's a pure waste of time for everyone at this point. In P2, they will have excuse "BuT i nEeD mY hOnOr". Funny thing is, these players, every time I found them on their own are actually fucking terrible at the game - they will jump you when you are pulling several mobs and they will still lose the fight. Every time.
---
Contrary to popular belief, enh shammies are one of the worst classes to maintain uptime on nightfall. Hunters would probably be the best followed by warriors and then retris.
---
Agree BFA = big fucking asscheeks
---
As a healer (resto specced) who has had several healing items - and I am not talking "increases damage and healing by X", but "increases healing by Y") - grabbed from me in 60 dungeons by people joining as DPS or tanks, I am starting to see the merit of reserving a single item when running a pug. If I've ran the place 10-20 times without getting the single piece of gear I need, I'll either run it with a guild/friends or pug it and reserve it. 
---
I realize it's selfish and narcissistic behavior to as the healer of a 5 man group expect that people refrain from rolling on the +healing gear you need (I mean, those other guys are 3x DPS and tank, but yea), but having played the numbers game and lost enough times I've grown annoyed with doing it in pugs since common sense seems to be in short supply. If I do this in a pug, however, people will be thoroughly informed about my intentions before they join and once the group is full. If they feel they need to be both DPS and have the right to need roll on that one healing item, there are probably other groups they can join.
---
5 wipes.
---
As such: 5 greater Arcane Elixirs
---
5 Elixirs of Shadow Power
---
5 Major Mana potions
---
5 Dark Runes
---
1 Blasted Lands int buff
---
5 greater fire protection potions.
---
I literally do this every time, I have to open my map and follow it....
---
If it starts getting really shitty then voidwalker is your second best friend, the sacrifice from it is unbelievably powerful.
---
Lol, no. Every class has items in MC, just not for every slot or every situation. But the best PVP gear comes from MC because stamina is king.
---
😂
---
This really bugged me lol
---
You can place an ability on the same spot as your stanceswap.
---
Example:  
---
On your battle and zerker bars, you place Defensive Stance on \[1\].  
---
On your defensive bar, you place Taunt on \[1\].
---
I've done that with Taunt, Overpower and Berserker Rage. That way those three skills are super easy to swap to.
---
**regarding key bindings** is there anyway to make the [grave accent/tilde key](https://imgur.com/a/GVwLZrB) into a modifier for 1/2/3/4/5?
---
No. Until they remove crossrealm, warmode, lfd/lfr there will be no sense of community which is what I play for.
---
 TBF, as a warlock i do like to push my threat to the absolute limit. How many mobs can i dot up w/o pulling aggro or how early/late can/should i hellfire, how many shadowbolts can i cast back to back? &amp; when they crit? I usually end up dying once or twice untill i know what the tank is capable of, after that its smooth sailing. 
---
Oh &amp; i often do steal aggro when the mob is low, when it easily is finished of by a death coil or shadowburn.
---
1% hit is worth about .8% dps increase, not accounting for rage generation.
---
Yeah, but have you ever looked TB bank? It's a fucking tent, how do you trust your items to be safe on a fucking tent?!?!
---
I got feet of the lynx for you. 500g
---
Yeah no, the system basically forces people to camp. I know people that will be farming honor 12h+ a day pushing ranks, and by farming honor it usually means running around as 5 looking for people to gank and corpse camp. Depending on how many such groups are on your server, there might not be any safe flightpaths left.
---
Hello, what does raid logging mean?
---
He asked how fast people do it. Been in pugs that clear the place in just over an hour, the raid isnt hard my dudes
---
Ironfoe is 0.3%
---
These messages can be good if worded correctly.
---
I had a guy farm the same shit as me for a while, and undercutted with 1-2g every time. Dropping the general price for a while and we'd repeat the cycle.
---
So i sent him a ingame mail, where i worded it like i was just looking out for both of us, told him to undercut me by a silver or copper and in the end we'd both earn more money. He never replied, but sure enough the next time i log over to bank alt to check AH i see he just undercutted with 1c.
---
I do like that they are getting rid of the many, many "versions" of the same piece of gear from titanforging, etc.
---
But right now, I don't think we know enough about it to really say one way or the other. My biggest fear is that they don't have any real gamers left on the dev team, so they lost that connection to what we want to play.
---
yeah but I think bringing more just for nightfall uptime would hurt overall raid dps
---
if druid could wear it we could give one to our moonkin so he can do something else besides dancing

I am making a shaman right now. Enh is basically just autoattack and totemtwist. Elemental is somewhat engaging as you need to downrank and wait for procs. I am gonna try rolling as Elehancement, where you basically just buff your flametongue/frostbrand weapon, throw all your mana at spamming big ele spells and then switching to manual crowd pummel the shit out of the boss afterwards, while still trying to get every single chance on hit proc item you can, as they usually scale with SP (and also scale with your increase to crit damage).
---
ok zoomer *^(/s)*
---
Not even old, just glad I can just come home, cook a meal and play alongside my wife. Life with no kid is great man
---
An Ele shaman can do some pretty good 1on1 and is also good in group play PvP. You can interrupt casts every 6 seconds, you can remove enemy buffs. Like iceshield for example. And you can make an instant guaranteed crit on your enemy. Hell with some luck you can cast Chain Lightning, Earthshock and then an instant Lightning Bolt to evaporate someone from full health.
---
That makes sense. I have used becoming closely knit with a guild to combat this but I do actually like seeing the same players all the time in classic. I see the same morons spamming trade and the same people grinding essence of water etc. And have grouped with the same groups after a week of zero communication just because were all together.
---
You need 5% from gear since you can’t spec into precision.
---
It there will be garrison/artefact lookalike mechanics, im definitely wont give it even a shout.
---
Really ? Is that simple ?
---
Damn it, now I want an Afroman song for WoW - he did a remixed version for Weedmaps, why not for WoW? It's only fitting seeing as how most of us are already over the age of 21 in Classic and a nice percentage do smoke bud to help alleviate their IRL stress and pain.
---
On my warr I had 1 macro for battle and aggressive stance, click to alternate between them. Prot stance on its own Key (shift 4 battle/bers, shift 3 prot stance)
---
Those frostbolts crit hard, and rogue has class-passive reduced threat. In the beginner dungeons I almost always had mobs turned juicy part towards me as a rogue, but as a mage I could pull aggro at any moment even if I was still drinking the first several seconds of the pull (and then I ran like a headless chicken)
---
Exactly my point. There is no reason to watch the video. Is is devoid of reason to invest lifetime to watch it
---
Blizzard saw this coming. Paladin healing causes half threat (0.25 threat per hp, instead of the normal 0.5).
---
It takes more time to get rage with 2handers, on a lot of trash you won't even get that whirlwind off before both the lavaspawns are dead, you won't get your execute off and so on. Your total damage matters more than boss damage, because it is what contributes to the clear time.
---
I agree, these are the kind of mechanics that made me not want to play bfa and made me hate legion to begin with. Im tried of doing chores. Let me grind in my own way damnit.
---
I think it’s also going to be depended on population ratio. Many pvp servers tend to be very horde sided. It may be difficult to get much for honour 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Bit of confusion here. What I was saying there was in reference to what the guy above me was doing, not a general statement on feral druid viability.
---
I'm totally on board with feral tanks and would have played one myself had I not already done so back in 2005.
---
Rofl ;)
---
Horde favored, high pop server and behind the level curce. 
---
Ofcourse it will be chill for you. Theres no one there to kill you.
---
I see you dont know whats a reckoning bomb..
---
Everytime I try to play retail I feel like every played character may as well be another npc. There is no need to communicate. I'd be ok with same realm lfd but that's about it.
---
Recording logs of peoples' performance for later viewing or analyzing.
---
"Inn" (N) for north. Flight path is opposite
---
Interesting. I have seen some ele shams absolutely shit damage at times. Then again I have out dps'd most of the shams i run into
---
And again trying to switch the topic to me. Not gonna work. I keep absolutely no gate here, you just cannot answer the simple question why you posted this video here. What did you try to get out of this? Praise? Laughs? Karma? I just don't get it
---
actually a lot of people still just cream their pants at anything purple even if it's not worth it.
---
Its been so long I cant remember if that is good for that level or not. Its seems like an interesting class that isnt entirely brainless though. Mage (unless its pvp) just feels boring.
---
I've seen 4 split rolls so far and they always were decided by the alphabetical order, probably because the way the names are sorted in the code.
---
Better play characters that start with Aa again.
---
The amount of damage tha you earn from the elemental tree isnt worth it comparing to the damage you loose by not having improve weapon  totems and weapon mastery, not having ss is also pretty boring but hey thats just me
---
I play a troll rogue, i don’t think i can avoid it, right?
---
"Tell me why you posted to reddit" isn't gatekeeping? Lol

Lvl 42, 9 days /played, can't wait to hit 60 and be done with leveling forever
---
I win attrition battles vs druids, granted I haven't encountered a tryhard one with engineering yet
---
Lol... There's a breadcrumb quest in Ashenvale that sends you to Stonetalon and tells you where this path is.
---
He sold his items, didnt he. And if the demand is higher than the supply, the price rises again instantly.
---
You cant tank the market on your own if the demand is there
---
It's not a threat meter and only shows when you already have aggro.
---
I use a lot of conditional macros to save space on hotbar and use same key for multiple skills.
---
For example:
---
/Cast [stance:1] Thunder clap
---
/Cast [stance:2] Disarm
---
Yeah I agree. In 1v1's Beastmastery spec is basically a 2v1.  
---
I don't think phase 2 will include much 1v1, probably rather groups of 4-5 roaming around.
---
The Phase 2 nightmare will be real, but shouldn't last too long. After all, battlegrounds will be coming out not too long after, and they'll be more efficient for honor grinding than camping lowbies.
---
Or maybe your dps warriors are shit
---
Fine, if you don't want to answer the question, be that way. But don'r expect people to ... do whatever you intendet them to do... because i am here, just questioning what i am supposed to do with this
---
15% is the debuff but we allready have one person providing it, a second one would merely increase the uptime on the debuff, if the 30% stated above are correct and my math checks out a second nightfall would mean about 5% boost to the 8 mages and 3 locks in our raid
---
5% for 11 DDs is much but we only have 2 hunters so we can't sacrifice one of them and we also only have one oomkin one cat one enh one shadow etc. so no "low-dps" spots left to switch in another nightfall
---
And... There's an Ashenvale quest that sends you to Stonetalon via this path. Lol
---
Yes of course.
---
Suc is much better for leveling
---
Holy cow i thought thats Just me ^^
---
oh it's so beautiful when the person complaining about someone not being educated on a topic is in fact the incorrect one.
---
Changing the loot rules as the group has already formed is BS. As I said everything has to be communicated from the start, as in before you even invite someone. Not doing this is basically fraud and not something I would tolerate either.
---
So going on I'm going to assume loot rules were communicated in the LFG-message. And in that case my arguments still apply. When talking about the effort I am talking about getting a group together. This can take a while of promoting your group in the LFG-channel, whispering, bringing friends and the like. This is effort they spend prior to even entering the instance. Maybe you think this isn't that much effort, but in this case you have to ask yourself why you aren't simply starting a group yourself.
---
Better equip makes it easier for you, because the run will be faster with a much lower risk of wiping.
---
Lastly reserving an item can serve a purpose of letting players join the run the leader would otherwise not invite. Like it or not, if reserving items was something not acceptable people would simply invite classes they don't compete for loot with. Someone looking for the cloak from baron might only invite casters for example. Clearly communicating what he is looking for creates a more flexibel filter, where players that look for something else can still join.
---
love them :)
---
doesnt describe my experience or intentions with the game

Pretty sure that just coincidence.

Not really. Pickup engineering, for PvP, and mining/herbing, to make some money.

---
As a young lad (10 years old or so) with english as my second language, we had no clue what "trinket" meant. So when discussing them with my friends we just called them earrings.
---
What're you trying to accomplish with this spec? Elemental Devastation is hot garbage and should generally be avoided - you won't really have a relevant chance to crit with your shocks in enhancement gear, and your melee damage won't be high enough to even bother with it in elemental gear.
---
Aka min maxing
---
its a meme
---
What makes you think I've never played on Nostalrius? People like me who played WoW originally made the game. There wouldn't even be private servers if the game hadn't been made popular by people like me.
---
You aren't asking what you should do. You watched it, thought it was shit, told me you thought it wasnt worthy of reddit, and then kept asking me what my whole reason for posting it Was.
---
Id think not
---
Obligatory "No, it's the children who are wrong" post
---
Kinda scares me that it does make sense from a business point of view.
---
I do speak for the majority. There is absolutely no way the "majority" are already 60. And if they are they aren't at the point where they've burned out on content.
---
Face it, you play for 4+ hours a day, that isn't achievable for many people.
---
Thing is, by releasing new content you made old content obsolete. Why did they release DM after like a month? It completely changes how you gear up. Just wish people who play for over 3/4 hours a day would stop acting like their subscription is worth more than mine.
---
Streamers are the biggest problem, they are visibly complaining and qqing and Blizzard feels like it needs them on side. That's the real issue.
---
Is there a way to check faction balance on a server?
---
Put a raid marker on him, thats what I did.
---
Am I missing something in your example? With what I said, if the "cartel" wants the buff out at 17:00, someone will turn in a head at 11:00 (where random guy no longer matters). Now of course there could be someone that messes it up before, but you could keep trying to go back an extra 6hours of whatever each time if it's such an issue, assuming you have enough guilds that care
---
I just asked this in yesterdays topic but since this one just opened up might as well repeat here.   
---
Im a lvl 44 drain tank lock and have no clue how to pvp. Could anyone give me tips on what spells to use in which situations and vs which classes ? I usually try to fear the person and then DOT them. Do I use immolate while they are close to me since they will interrupt it most likely?   
---
Also, what happens if I dont manage to fear them? should I even bother trying to life drain them ? Or is the whole game basically fear or seduction and wait until the DOTs drain them out?   
---
Also, a bit of an offtopic question. I dont usually game much so I dont have a proper laptop/pc for it. I run classic on a ultrabook which is overheating during it.   
---
I am considering buying a new laptop for gaming or a desktop PC during the Black Friday sales. Will be pretty much only used for Wow currently. Any suggestions on subreddits where I can get advise on what to get ? I am not planning on building my own pc because I cant be bothered.
---
One does not simply *not* play wow.
---
Our dps warriors spent an inordinate amount of gold on their gear and are bis. I drop tranq on p1 ony, then wf just before she takes off. Saying threat is not an issue in classic is crap. It is an actual issue unlike retail where you have more chance of pulling someone out of black hole than pulling threat after avengers shield
---
hunters barely do damage in p5 when you get access to nightfall anyways ;)
---
So did I but ended up thinking trinket was a fancy old word for ear ring until I was told otherwise.
---
60 lock here, I usually only cast immolate if CoA, corruption, siphon life (if specced) are applied and the target is feared. Immolate tends to break fear often due to the initial damage and the dot component, so it's often better to just run opposite of where your target is being feared to. More often than not, immolate is a 'kill faster' spell and not really neccesary to win most fights.
---
LMAO talk about over-reacting, you really think people will camp STV that much more? If anything theres gonna be less since people arent very interested in lowbies compared to 50+ players.
---
Reason?
---
Its pretty decent. I am beating out warriors on single target when they have their for the lvl bis axe ;)
---
yeah...
---
Just look for the bats in the ceiling.
---
This.  Though I have to say there was a rogue on Incendius who was trying to become another Angwe and got shit on repeatedly until he stopped trying.. THAT was funny.

In theory yes.

Pre BiS pvp set for a warrior is literally lucky rng plate greens with stam str agi lol.
---
Yep, maybe a loop hanging from a belt, something you'd latch a trinket onto. Never put much thought into it since that makes sense.
---
Tank aggro a pack, you pick his target and do your autoshot, aimed shot, multishot rotation. If you pull aggro due to crits or bad tank, you feign.  
---
You got a way to clear all your threat every 30 seconds, why wouldn't you multishot quickly?

Was boosting some pug through BRD a couple of days ago and the recipe drops. I'm halfway thinking that somebody non enchanter is gonna ninja it for gold (goes for 400g in AH).
---
Well I guess nobody really knew about how expensive it was; we greed rolled and I won! Figured I could sell it but I mailed it to my alch friend in return for free potions for as long as we play, excluding flasks.
---
If I've got the opportunity to cast immolate I will use it but it's low on the priorities. Immolate breaks fear quite a lot so if (big if) I cast immo I'm already mashing my fear cast.
---
Essentially, fear and affliction DoTs, keep 30+ yards away from the enemy and as they get close get the fear going (watch out for warrior/feral charge).

I'm a druid and I don't see how it's able to 1v1 anything in PvP. Except changing form that cost 1/4 of your max mana when you're agility focused, you have nothing to break the CC/slow. And when you're intelligence focused, you have the mana pool but 3 of your 4 spells have a casting time so long that you're dead by the time you cast it. I'm noob so I obviously am not thinking of everything, but I have a hard time seeing how druid can 1v1 anyone in PvP.
---
Oh WoW ... looks awesome already!!!
---
&gt;Absolutely not true. I honestly pity you given how sorely misguided your thoughts are on this subject.
---
Save your pity, fact is when Blizz released DM so early they made the progression change and made several items obsolete. Many of us wanted to play without DM for a bit like it was in the early days. The whole BiS list changed overnight making many things obsolete, or less desirable to run.
---
&gt;I did for the first several weeks, now I only raid log. Is this supposed to be some sort of confession? I love wow, I'm okay with saying I played a lot in the first 3 weeks. I can only assume this is an issue for you out of projection?
---
So you freely admit you played a LOT. Many people can't just take weeks out of their life to get to the point of raid logging. Don't you think it's a lot fairer for Blizzard to wait for the people who can't drop everything at a moment's notice for a video game. Why are you even arguing back with me, you have content, you're 60 you're raiding, you should be happy right now.
---
&gt;9 weeks after release. A month is 4.4 weeks.
---
Oct 15th, definitely not 9 weeks after release. This is just false.
---
&gt;Yeah so literally no one holds this opinion. Again, I can only raise your objection as projection lol.
---
Sure they don't, that's why people like you are dismissing my opinion. You think because you have sank more of your life into the game this past few months your opinion is worth more. Everything about this interactions tells me that.
---
&gt;I wouldn't know because I don't watch WoW streamers. Given your busy life, I wouldn't imagine you'd have time to watch them as well. Yet somehow you are able to opine upon their complaints. Interesting.
---
No, I don't watch them, but anyone who played then and now can see the huge culture shift.
---
Let's say you have a raid with a bunch of rogues, warriors, hunters and shamans. Obviously you'll want to have a shaman in every group but how do you divide the rogues &amp; warriors vs the hunters? Do you put one hunter in every group too so 3 melee get WF + Trueshot? Or do you try put hunters in their own group with agility totem instead?

Stop buying gold and making bullshit reddit posts pretending somebody accidentally sent it to you asshole
---
There actually was a sizable deflation when bfa dropped. In Legion and WoD you could make a butt load of gold by simply logging in and running some missions, which only took 5 minutes across multiple toons. They severly nerfed these features and prices generally halfed since then.
---
Thanks fam
---
&gt;From 260-300 is where it gets stupid expensive.
---
Is it? I skilled from 260-300 so quickly and easily, just some parts, Thorium grenades and from 280-300, bullets are orange.
---
That is actually a bannable offense. I would love to see OP getting banned for that, that'd be ironic.
---
Someone recruited me as a solo tank for UBRS at level 58. It worked perfectly fine. I tanked many instance underleveled and it works fine. The worst was uldaman at level 40 (last boss is 47),  if the mobs are not more than 6 level above it’ll work fine
---
Some? I think the majority of players in wow classic are mentally ill.
---
Would probably worth its own thread. Personally I'll say LBRS, because it is very different to later expansion dungeons, while still being run way more than BRD (full).
---
Not exactly great for horde either. Yes we have the numbers but we also have lvl 60 bitter, PTSD-hardened alliance players out for vengeful blood that will kill anything with a horde PvP icon, level or honour be damned lol.

Can't you read?

Because it was probably misinterpreted as "Rings don't show -In WoW-" and thus stating the exact thing the original comment stated.

I misread it that way too at first until I read the comment thread again and realized he was saying "Rings don't show -in Runescape-" instead.
---
Levelling an arms warrior, what should my rotation be in dungeons going forward. Level 17 atm
---
I can guarantee you druids can get ganked. While leveling it's easier to get away since you're not running from 10+ man gank squads with MC gear and epic mounts but in hot areas you are. They'll have hunters with trackings and flare, they'll have another druid with NS roots to chase you and rogues and druids positioned in the back line. Sure a druid can distract a few from the raid but not for long enough to make a real difference. And there' always the choke point at the entry to Brm.
---

I tanked UBRS solo at 58, and did multiple dungeon under level. It can of depend, hunt underlevel will do fine, warior dps will do terribly
---
You're telling me I've been entering Onyxia her period?!
---
For idiots there is no difference. If they can get any kind of emotional reaction out of you its a win
---
BRD absolutely. Though I love me some SFK, it really impressed me back in the day and I still think it's got the best atmosphere of all the low level dungeons (especially the music).
---
3rd party program which lets you change   your appearance (for yourself only others can't see it) like race, gear, mount, spellgfx into almost anything available in game. Dunno if it supports classic. Whether it's bannable or not has been discussed for years, it's a gray area, so tread lightly.
---
I was obivously talking about 40+, but seeing level 60's with the SM helmet is as common as it gets.
---
I think they should break up some of the phases a bit more, not sure about a 77day cycle though.
---
Getting a phase 2.5 with WSG and AV would add more things to do without making the players who play less/less efficient feel like they are falling far behind gear wise.
---
Also, it would allow players who are going hard on the game to start doing things like twinking
---
I think this problem goes both ways, they probably think they need to be wearing a shield to tank because so many people get upset when their warrior tank isn't wearing a shield even though it isn't needed at all for most dungeons besides certain bosses.
---
I wonder how does my huge battle chicken fit into the ear
---
I am obv talking about actual coordinated PvP here. BRE is the best weapon in the game for Warriors.
---
1on1s is a complete different topic and needs completely different talents &amp; gear.
---
This is the real money trader dude. Again.
---
When those fucker warlocks hellfire into your frostnova and break everything while you're stuck with your dick in your hands casting flamestrike; makes my blood boil smh
---
Oh wow, congrats!
---
I can feel the love from here !
---
Level 17 with 47 days played here.
---
That was a problem with the player's skill, not his level.
---
Especially as a healer and hunter, you can run all the dungeons really early. Healers won't really care about the level, and since ranged attacks can't be dodged/parried and can't be glancing blows, hunters will do more than enough damage. Only the pets will be useless.
---
If he body pulled, it means he either was out of position (his fault, not his level's), or you skipped some mobs that you shouldn't have.
---
This is hands down one of the best posts in this entire subs history! Well done.
---
Green lens of frozen wrath is worse than a green frozen wrath helm for raw dps

1 priest? Damn I want to be in that raid!

---
You like having *fun* in games? The fuck's wrong with you? It's all about streaming your "experience" while playing, blogging your wordly views on &lt;insert terrible social platform&gt; and screaming about the injustice of man against man, expecting a videogame developer to right all the wrong of the world.
---
I seriously hope they will prioritize matching teams from the same server.
---
Let the game try find a server-match for 5 minutes, if thats not possible, then change to cross-realm.
---
Skill, experience and min maxing when it comes to gear will definitely offset ALOT of at least aq40, prob first two thirds of Naxx as well.
---
Yeah if you play horde on a pvp server it is easy mode.
---
Imagine thinking warcraftlogs is representative of the average population. Hunters by far top meters in certain fights, like onyxia, lucifron easily first, stuff like garr and gehenas also since they can multi shot easily. Where mages are gonna be on top of course is rag, domo (cause aoe), sulfuron (also cause aoe).
---
TL;DR:
---
Learn how aggro works.
---
B-b-but how will we clear the dungeon if we dont sheep moon trap blue sap star hex green blind square kick x and focus skull
---
It comes from Everquest where you could wear earrings. WoW originally had the exact same gear setup but changed it fairly quickly in development.
---
That's pretty interesting. I haven't followed the news about all the expansions, but hear nothing but negativity all the time about the 'current expansion'. How do you experience these "new features" personally? Was it a lot of new stuff that you couldn't catch up with, or was it easy to step in? Also how much did you pay for the booster, wasn't that risky?
---
Decurse potions = restorative potion?
---
In no way is taunt an "emergency" spell in raids. By using a combination of taunt -&gt; mocking blow -&gt; taunt you can keep the boss glued on you for long enough to generate so much rage from being hit. Then you can use that rage to actually generate more threat with sunders + shield slam. Acting like dps actually need to wait a really long time is kind of fucking ridiculous, and is only important when the boss actually needs to be positioned somewhere important.
---
Is this an out of season game of thrones season 8 joke
---
It is going to be the same for low lvl twinks fighting each other in the leveling zones, its gonna be very normal to be rank 2-3 when you hit 60 with your toon .
---
Agree. 
---
Even without a mage it's not that hard. We ran emp really early while leveling in a guild group, and our group was prot warrior, shadow priest, healing shadow priest, warlock, and me as ele shaman. Fire Nova totem is more than enough for torch room
---
&gt; Surely 10% more overall weapon damage outweighs a low chance to periodically have 9% extra crit
---
When you put this in a vacuum it indeed does not make sense. But crits mean flurry uptime, which pushes it closer to the 10% additional damage. 
---
the main problem with the build, IMHO, is the requirement of the 13 points in resto to take the hit talent. I think without that requirement, you could go 20/31/0 and pick up even more talents to capitalize on melee-spell synergy. But alas, the 3% hit is a requirement for raiding you just can't get around.
---
Always thought it was a necklace with a ring on it
---
it has, always win those roll since my name starts with a

Cries
---
50/50. Often people see it as a weakness and just use it to spoil your fun. I don't get it to be honest. First looking desperately for a tank and then doing everything to make him quit the group.
---
I have never liked the "don't ask questions" mentality. Feels like the people that get upset when asking obvious questions like "oh do you like hiking?". Sure the answer is probably yes but it's also an icebreaker and leads people talking about why they like it.
---
Some things are better to Google but if i know something i always respond, to some degree i think it's one of the most rewarding things to put your experience to direct use, giving good hints att how to approach things and possibilities that otherwise goes unnoticed.
---
I was a 9 year old when i first started playing in vanilla, then i became the change i wanted to se and the amount of people grateful sparks joy. The people seeing helping others as a nuisance are missing out.
---
And playing wow blind seems like fun but i have to say, people in all games i know can be elitist and gatekeeping, I'd say think more of it as a personality type. Because there are so many welcoming and helpful players as well don't rob yourself of that truth.
---
Enhancer are placed on the left side (west) between Merle group and tank spot approximately. Lava burst may occasionally one hit one of them but that's all right, as long as the meele camp and tanks are not hit by these.
---
Can't say anything to elemental fire.
---
Range placent should be at least  ./range 17 you are better of  with /range 18.
---
Knockbacks are normal and fly everywhere as well unless you insist your raid to use several greater fire protection potions in fight, you gotta live with it. ( first potion pre fight so that CD is ready right after knock back)
---
Again can't tell you anything about 2 tank strategy, we just play it with one main tank and a second who tanks in case Mt got a knock/kick whatev. Maybe it's the same.
---
I hope you will do a 10/10 on the second id. Raggi is mostly about gear and that will eventually be better next id.
---
Hey you’re slower than me! My top is 27 followed by a 24 hah.
---
&gt; Not everyone uses TSM or auctioneer.
---
And even then, since the addons aren't based off of sales, but rather simply listing prices, there is no guarantee that the price it gives is actually what the item sells for. Only applicable to rarer (and usually more expensive) items of course.
---
WHAT!? NO WAY
---
Coincidence. Multiple times I've lost with my name starting A and we have the same roll.
---
Step one : check with the tank how long he'd like before you charge Skull
---
Step two : Wait that long
---
Step three : Now you charge, rend, sunder armor and so on
---
Optional step : If the tank wants you to 'offtank' a thing, then you charge, render, sunder and so on that thing
---
Vanilla has this weird itemisation where defensive stats are exceptionally rare compared to offensive stats. It's pretty much only stamina and some choice resistance/dodge gear. This means that as the game progresses, your offensive stats outweigh your defensive stats massively. By AQ40 and especially Naxxramas you will still have the same healthpool as an MC geared player, but you'll do five times more damage so everyone is just running around one-shotting people. That's partly why on every single private server the PvP community vanishes as soon as AQ40 is released. I suspect the same will happen in Classic when we get there.
---
TM vs. SS was a thing in PvE servers back then, and you bet your ass that it'll be a thing now too.
---
sort that taskbar out mate, shit's a mess
---
...how
---
As a human/dwarf/gnome, I sometimes use the Theramore&lt;Ratchet&lt;The Barrens&lt;Stonetalon path. It's also a good way to get easily the Ratchet flypath.
---
Should be very easy to check addons then, just sit in town and mash /reload until you get acceptable load times.
---
IIRC there was a way to measure addon performance, but I don't remember what it was.
---
True, 1% was way to lenient..
---
This is how I have always seen it [https://imgur.com/a/HnSeRrx](https://imgur.com/a/HnSeRrx)
---
Why would you want to kill shit? Also, how do you kill that which has no life (shit)?
---
That‘s deep... lol
---
I am using earth to water, only 8g to 20g, but still solid given that it can be obtained quite easily after few hours of grinding timbermaw :D
---
How long will it take for phase 3? 2months after phase 2?
---
It's obvious because of the R14 weapon? You don't get R14 by doing uncoordinated PvP.
---
In 1on1 or random bgs you are speccing Arms/Prot, not Arms/Fury. Just saying. Ask R14 pserver PvP player or anyone that participated as a warrior in a tournament duel setting.
---
Gear is also different as you will use a lot more gimmick items when not running around with a pocket healer. You will use a lot more engineering trinkets/helmets &amp; going for more stam.
---
While doing coordinated PvP with a healer you will use a lot more offensive stats.
---
i fucking hate you
---
Just wait until it stands still in front of the tank. Then it should be easy to get behind it.
---
I need to listen to that album
---
with my lvl 55 lock i killed lvl 60 warriors in 2v1 when they think good idea gank lowbies.
---
Alliance rogue. Lvl 38 with 60g. Skinning and herbalism. Where is the best spot to farm 40g?
---
Our healer did this with a warlock once. Refused to heal his life taps after a fight. The warlock didn’t eat or drink between pulls, so he ended up just dying from the mobs’ first hit when he pulled aggro (which he did too).
---
End result was we didn’t finish Ulda as warlock won an item off the priest (huge spirit item) who wouldn’t heal him, so priest hearthed - which was a pain in the ass for me as tank as all I wanted was a chance at a wep off the last boss.
---
Really, as long as the number of mobs &lt; the healing power and sustain or your healer, you only need the healer alive. DPS pulling aggro happens, random crit streaks etc. But if it’s constantly their fault (spriest spamming mind blast or dotting mobs on pull), explain aoe taunt is on CD, get second on the aggro pool of all the mobs and said dumb dps die.
---
Yeah yeah, clicker pepehanda ;)
---
What he says.
---
I haven't played Enh at 60, but I don't see how it would be that difficult to hit cap, especially if you go with Orc + axe, then it even drops to 6%. That should be possible with Truestrike, Devilsaur, the +1% hit boots and a ring with %hit. 
---
If not orc, a combination of DM:N ring + Mara ring + Hinterlands trinket + Mask of the Unforgiven in addition to the above ones will land you at or above cap. 
---
I see a lot of 20/31 going around, but not this split spec of yours.
---
&gt; 📷[ Righteous Fury](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25780/righteous-fury) grants additional threat on all holy abilities, not just attacks. 
---
This was confirmed by blizzard.
---
This ... I know it can suck having a second person, but there are techniques you can use to up your success chances. 
---
I kept getting skins stolen from a bot on my server when I was solo. Now if I am solo I just let him do the work and take the skin. He is on 24 hours a day non-stop between two spawn points. So with the 8 min spawns on my server, I take an hour get 16 skins and go on my way.
---
Additionally, I have found most of the Devilsaur skinners/hunters on my faction are pretty reasonable. If I let them know I am there for 2 or 3 skins and after will get out of the way, usually I get left alone. If I need a few skins cheap, I PST them and cut a deal off the AH price.
---
I don't know enough of the terminology to call this bullshit all proper like, but I think it's bullshit.
---
Because to entertain the notion that the majority of the market was made aware of this price change due to 25 Devilsaur leather means it didn't sell fast at the adjusted price. If it didn't sell fast at the adjusted price it means the 15% undercut wasn't such a steal. If the 15% undercut wasn't such a steal then chances are good people have been slinging Devilsaur leather in tradechat for less than 6g, likely closer to 5.
---
Lool this guy again
---
Sounds like someone who only has nothing to archive in rl
---
Man Utd fans are all secretly RM fans as well
---
Maybe ? don't know? between 55 and 60 I did 2 LBRS complete, 2 ubrs, 3 DM north, 2 scholo and 1 strat (on each side).
---
I guess I got carried a lot then and I'm not even in a guild
---
The cats of badlands. Their trash is expensive and you can also skin them
---
ok boomer
---
Stones elementals in badlands or fire elementals in arathi? I guess.
---
What did they do? Undercut you or purchase your items?
---
Both seem like things any idiot would do.
---
On days like this, I love being a druid.

Why wouldn’t it be

I don't know what is up with this mentality. I have never died more than two or three times on my way to brd or MC. Most classes have some way to survive at least a little bit or to get some distance. The issue I have noticed with my guildys is they can't help but stop and try and fight back even if they know it is a lost cause.
---
Are you alliance? Could always try and come from Kargath and head west (if you're Horde). I find it's safer that way.
---
thorium point is neutral and has like no guards, if you're horde fly to Kargath
---
Devilsaur gloves are actually better than T1 gloves though unless you also have the pants tier piece.
---
7 runs and still haven't seen it, it's always the fkin hunter helm + whatever.
---
Why, killing Boars in Elwynn forest, of course!
---
...can't really fathom where the 17 days come from either, but unless someone pushes for realm first 60, I guess there's no real point in rushing. Better just play the way you enjoy it in that case, I took my sweet time to level to 60 as well.
---
Would they both work at the same job? What if A wants to be an accountant and B wants to be a construction worker? Does B have to wear a tie when A is at the accountant job interview?
---
Once you are R14 you aren't premading as much anymore, because there is always a warrior aspiring to get the next high rank. There really is no shortage of good warriors wanting to rank, therefore you dropping out of the premade stomping pugs is in most cases a blessing for the premade.
---
Sure, if there is an opposing faction's premade that need to be taught their place, so they dont drag out games, you will perhaps step in again, but for the most part you are done premading once you are R14.
---
The rest of your post I can agree with. Rocket boots, goblin helm, reflector etc. are a godsend. However from 16 item slots, you have head, boots and trinkets that you are switching around. R13 gear is simply R13 gear and will be best for the most part.
---
It's no a repost, I'm doing the add to riducule it not promote it.
---
That’s possibly the slowest way to rank up.
---
A bunch of insanely powerful trinkets and consumables. Engi is pretty much required for pvp, due to how powerful it is.
---
It is, yes.
---
These are pretty safe guidelines. On Gilneas Alliance, I did 6 hours a weekday and 20 hours on weekends for 8 weeks to make Rank 11. It was insanity. I felt like the South Park kids in the WoW episode.
---
To make rank 14 on Gilneas it was 20 hours a day for 12+ weeks. If you had a full time job, it was near impossible on Alliance. The horde faction built a mafia and would organize getting Rank 14. It kept the grind times down and everyone waited their turn. It was really weird.
---
I was talking to a friend who's fury and he says its because a lot of tanks get so focused on stacking mitigation that they barely build threat. Then they scream at dps even though we did wait for Sunders.
---
Meh.  
---
\*swipes left\*
---
he has more taskbar icons than i do desktop icons
---
Is Felwood contested on your server? If not, it's gotta be the best solo farming spot. If yes, fire elementals in arathi are a decent alternative.
---
I came back for Classic, last time I played before that was Pandaria trial days (so I rerolled a Panda Shaman) where I discovered Cataclysm areas a bit.
---
My main was a Tauren Druid starded in classic, BC and WotLK came and still wasn't 60 (played by phase).
---
All the Shadowland hype as hit me, I was again curious at retail...
---
So, Yesterday I used lvl 110 boost on my Historical main, discovering new UI and all, having lost old stuff, getting the Legion weapon and all... It's a bit weird but enjoyable, easy to get back too if you're willing to learn again.
---
In my head-roleplay it's like my toon was trapped in the Emerald Dream since I left him and finally was found after all this years... I went back to Org, took flight and rediscovered the land that had changed, even run WC to get stuff to mog (yeah, fell into that quickly).
---
And you know what ?
---
I had fun, not the same stressfull and rewarding classic grinding fun, a different kind of fun.
---
So yeah, I'll stick with classic for a while, working on leveling my toon at my pace, but in the end I'll probably go back to retail and enjoy the possibilities it has to offer.
---
New Leveling seems like a Dream for the altholic/lore fan that I am, I'll be able to live through the stories that have me curious.
---
The same morons that do these kind of services.
---
And just the one Banish on Garr, oof
---
with Swtor 6.0 I already have the perfect recipe to survive p2 world pvp. I raid with my gunslinger.
---
Pet stun is very unreliable since it's reliant on your Pet's next sucessful attack i.e. not through shields and barriers.
---
With that comp you're not going to be killing Garr adds anyway.
---
Remember that players will only attack other players if they think they have a massive advantage. You have to find out what that advantage is and try to negate it. 
---
If their advantage is level based then there isn't really much you can do because of how spell hit scales with level difference. At that point you might as well just try and get some dots on to annoy him and let him kill you. 
---
If the advantage is numbers then you should act really aggressively. Most groups engage because they believe their friends are with them. If you head straight for their healer with a rocket helmet and seduce/fear another one then they will most likely panick and either completely run away or just play really bad. Warlocks are great at handling more than one target. Fear is incredibly powerful if you can get one off, especially in wPvP where the feared player can pull mobs. If you have engineering you can net melee players and dot them up while you go after their healer.
---
If you feel that bothered by a game you should probably just quit. Grinding doesn't stop in this game. Like it even makes sense.. If you want all rewards just given to you for almost no effort. you know where you should go 😅
---
I had a rogue gank me the other day while i was finishing off a questmob. I ran back, respawned and instantly killed him. But then i realised it was just a random similar leveled orc with same gear that had done me no harm. Feelsbadman
---
You probably just haven’t learned to fight them yet - at least at max level resto / balance Druid’s do pretty well against mages
---
You get an insane amount of useful trinkets (flame reflector, shadow reflector, frost reflector, battle chicken, etc) as well as access to grenades and sapper charges.
---
Yup, a lot of casters should rank to get some bis items imo. Mages won't replace shoulders for a long time, like untill AQ I believe. Don't quote me on that though

Shadowbringers next September. Classic cycle wi have 50% intended duration.

Back in the days blizzard's policy was that PvP problems require PvP solutions. You lost this one and that sucks.
---
&gt; The guy who listed his at 5g10s could have sold just as many at 5g89s and made himself more money and not tanked the market.
---
You are speaking as if that's something you have proof of, when in fact, you have nothing like it. Try to picture the psychological aspects. By lowering the price significantly there is a possibility that one lowers the price below the "pain limit" for others, in the sense that they would rather wait and see if the market recovers before unloading their own goods. I often do it myself on various goods as the price changes are usually temporary. So, if he was competing against me, he would have effectively removed a potential competitor from the market, as I would've liked undercut him in turn if he had simply undercut with 1s, while I might not be willing to immediately list at the lowered price. 
---
Not that I would do the same myself, but I can understand the psychology behind it, if that was the persons intent (deliberately or not).
---
It´s even gettin weirder: Why to left ears?!
---
why is there only 2 need rolls?
---
Queue the next "this is why tanking sucks" post ...
---
So you have taken a photo of you taking a photo of a screenshot of you leveling 60.
---
Congratz! I am still at 42 :( Damn work!
---
Both are way too contested unless u can farm at 3-6 am and you will still struggle.
---
I love when anyone uses it because I instantly know what type of person they are, and their relative IQ.
---
I hate both Barca and RM. I liked and watched them during the galacticos era cause of Becks transferring (traumatic experience) and Zizou/Ronaldo but that's it. Hated them when they got Cristiano (another traumatic experience) and then they wanted De Gea so..r
---
I did. I was out of mana and he was like 1/3 hp. He then sheeped me, took a first aid, and then I couldn't do anything against his slow with no mana. I tried to morph into a cat, but was too slow to go melee with him.
---
How did you get killed ? the fact that you did not kill him is not surprising but rather that youy did not manage to run away. A druid heal is pretty impossible to catch
---
Yeah I've done some duo farming at like 5 AM there and it's crazy GPH, you can get like 200/h combined if there isn't more than 1 other player in the way.
---
WHO USES VENTRILO, That's a fucking Ventrilo icon on his taskbar
---
Grow a pair, you pussy.
---
Masters hat is better
---
took me about 30 minutes to complete this quest. AH is a godsend for it. Spent about 80s on the pages I didn't already have. Don't know why I never did it back in the day. Even gave me some nice boots for when I hit 40.
---
piggyback: look up failz on youtube for plenty more ele sham videos. very skilled player.
---
Stomp looked like some creature grinning with a big moustache, never really questioned it until I started my druid alt...
---
Rolling my eyes at the fact hat he was a tank and so the healers probably we’re fine with it being a harder time than not getting to do it at all.
---
What do u farm ? Felcloth?
---
He would still see all the same jokes on this subreddit when he visits it... Like what is that boomer response?
---
That is what I hope too. Maybe even one by one, starting with WSG and have AB come in 3 weeks later and AV again 3 weeks later. On most servers the Alliance is outnumbered by 60/40 or even more, I'm already feeling bad for them.
---
okay :) but what have you collected for phase 2?
---
You're slightly wrong actually. You're using the assumption that without this recipe you wouldn't transmute anything at all. Fire -&gt; Earth and Earth -&gt; water should both be roughly 10 gold or day recipes, and both easy to get. Making it 120 days to make your money back.
---
Toxic horrors for waters.
---
Felcloth farming is absolutely horrendous from my experience, I did it for demonic runes for tailoring for a few hours and got almost no felcloth in the process.
---
If you have been playing together with a group so everyone knows what the other is going to do and/or all know the dungeon and the important mobs, you don't.
---
If you have high level players that know what they are doing, you also need little to none. In every other case, it is a good idea to at least communicate a little or a lot, depending on how many factors you have to deal with (new players need guidance, players that struggle due to level need to focus or it will end in desaster etc.).
---
Always play with succu, better dps for leveling anyway. Someone jumps you, seduce them. You wanna jump someone, seduce them. Need to reset fight? Seduce them. 2v1? Seduce. Against hard casting classes just spam it to interrupt lol, imagine fighting a warlock when you're stunned for half a second every 3 seconds or so. It's op. Felhunter is generally better for PvP but while leveling succu is by far the best. After seduce Heal self if needed, cast soulfire(800)(optional but fun if you crit, can replace with immolate or sbolt or fear), coil(400), fear, dot up or sbolt(400), win. The use of coil is optional and sometimes you should save it for later. When you get shadowburn replace fear and dot with burn. At this point you're at 2k+ Hp after bandage or health stone and they've lost at least 1600(2k with sburn) without being able to do anything. 
---
Against warrior use curse of exhaustion and try to stay in dead zone, save coil for when they intercept so you can space right. Against MM hunter who's good also use coex, although I've found seducing hunter and killing pet first to be the best. 
---
General tips: Make a macro that always has your pets most useful ability and bind it to a good keybind. Always sac void if you're using it. Don't channel drain Life against classes with a good interrupt because getting shadowlocked fucks you up. Plan when you let your dots drop if you need to reset fight with seduce, siphon lasts 30s so don't use it if you need seduce, you can remove agony with weakness. After you get sburn you can often rely on burst instead of fear and dots.
---
Is it though? Don't you share honor among all your Group members?
---
Depends on server kinda, large brilliant on gehennas is like 1.5g each atm, however its still some silver extra here n there ofc
---
Dont spam moonfire.
---
I never knew this until lvling on classic
---
Wait that isn’t how I ever saw it as a bag at all
---
Or use an addon who does that for you.
---
my Name is Shambolic and I support this message.
---
They also aren't close to any guards. Is standing on AH roof in Org oob?
---
#boring
---
I could have run away, but it's not fun for him in this case. I had almost 10 lvl advantage, I can give him a kill I don't really care.  
---
But I don't understand how I'm supposed to fight. I can't just spam my instant spell, it takes out my mana in 5 seconds and if he isn't dead after that I can't do shit. And I can't go melee because ice mages can always slow you down and you can't morph/unmorph to remove it without emptying your mana pool. He kept he blink for when I was casting my roots to get out of range and would cast a spell when I was closing the distance. I really felt unable to do anything
---
Option a. There would be at least one more set of pecs and abs running down the middle if it was option b.
---
It's the same honor system we had back in the days with full rewards. I copy paste one of my comment:
---
Here's the (quite awful) honor system of Vanilla: (numbers are not exact but globally right, also percentage of player in each tier changed depending on patch)*
---
* (1) kill other faction player to get honor points (there's diminishing return so you can't kill the same people over and over) 
---
* (2) at the end of the week, there will be a (hidden) ranking of the player in your faction based on who got the more honor points during that week
---
* (3) the top 0.2% of the player will be in the first tier of reward and get 12'000 rank points (not to be confused with honor point)  then the next tier (which is between 0.2 and 0.7%) will receive 11'000 rank points, then the next tier 10'000 rank points, etc 
---
* (5) to get to rank 14 you must get 60'000 rank points (rank 13 - 55'000, rank 12 - 50'000)
---
* (6) each week you decay 20% of your current rank points
---
That's all!
---
**practical exemple no1:** Darklegolass666 is rank 5 because he has a total of 15'000 rank point at the beginning of the week. He plays like a madman all week and achieve to be the first of his faction (gg darklegolass666) he will earn 13'000 rank points! next week he will have 15'000 (total before) - 3'000 (decay) + 13'000 (total of the week) so: 25'000 rank point and reach rank 7!
---
**practical exemple no2:** Darklegolass666 is now rank 13 (55'000 rank points) however he can't play 4 days because he must go visit grandma. Darklegolass666 just manage to be in the first 20% of the player of the week and only win 6000 rank points. This could sound ok but because of decay, he will not only not get rank point but lose some!  55'000 - 11'000 + 6000 =  50'000! he's back at rank 12! suck to visit grandma!
---
**tl;dr:** kill people and you'll get rank that allow you to buy rewards but don't dream too much: if you're a 'normal' player, you will never be near the top of your ladder so everything will go slowly and anything above rank 10 is almost unreachable for non-hardcore player.
---
My rogue at 58 was better geared than most 60s would be. 
---
Obviously can’t know that but I had 6% hit and 5-6 pieces of BIS or near BIs.
---
One benefit of immolate is also that having it counterspelled or kicked is fairly inconsequential. If I'm being beaten on and can't fear, I'll often cast immolate after my other dots are up. Fairly often they'll kick or counterspell it, leaving me free to cast drain life or fear uninterrupted. 
---
But in general, throw as many dots as you can on the enemy while they're feared, immolate included.
---
According to that my sever is 70/30 horde/alliance.
---
I play a night elf and I'm at 57. Phase 2 will be interesting for sure...
---
Maybe more
---
I was trying to find the mount in the screenshot.
---
Eh....I would argue you've WAY overthought the whole 'realistic' setting situation in classic. Admittedly what I'm about to say is just my opinion like yours, but I really do think the only reason they kept stuff relatively conservative was because they were still hopeful for a warcraft 4.
---
Consider every major villain in classic:
---
1. Ragnaros. Doesn't exist, not a real villain. He's not a warcraft villain in the slightest.
---
2. Onyxia. Doesn't exist, not a real villain. She's not a warcraft villain in the slightest.
---
3. Hakkar. Not real at all. Some nonsense they threw in the game.
---
So on and so forth. These aren't warcraft characters in the slightest.
---
Where was Illidan? Arthas? Kel'thuzad?
---
All this nonsense they created for World of Warcraft ensured that WC4 could come off without a hitch. I think they were surprised with just how successful WoW became and then simply decided to play out WC4 via WoW. Probably the first time they had the guts to start affecting the setting was with Naxxramas, where you got to fight Kel'Thuzad. The expansion pack immediately after promised you'd even fight Illidan. Many, if not most, of the villains to come out afterwards were all tied very closely to the original WC games.
---
I won't argue though that the writing in all these expansion packs have been terrible. They absolutely have been. Them turning the player into this glorious hero was a nice novelty, but it wore off pretty fast. And yes, being level 100+ and still being at risk from a deer is pretty silly.
---
Yes it does. 
---
I am using it as a goldmaker for my epic mount. I stopped doing quests around the time I could farm BRD/LBRS up until 60.
---
I have *WPL/EPL and Winterspring* still open and am sitting at 860g atm. Questing and doing a couple of dungeons after getting level 60 will get you your epic mount.
---
I did a couple of quests in the following zones before 60 (Alliance):
---
* Searing Gorge, Buring Steppes, Feralas, Felwood, Blasted Lands
---
I did not do any quests at all in the following areas: 
---
* Un'Goro, WPL, EPL, Winterspring, Silithus, Azshara
---
At 60 up until this point I did *Searing Gorge, Bunring Steppes, Feralas, Felwood, Un'Goro, Azshara and Silithus*. I did most of the dungeon quests minus the ones from Silithus including dungeon quests from WPL/EPL that you could easily get.
---
So I am near my epic mount with a ton of stuff in *WPL/EPL and Winterspring* to do.
---
Do you know how much it would cost to upgrade engi to 300?
---
There being a cause and effect doesnt make it good storytelling
---
yes, I think the lowest ive been killed by was a mage 8 or 9 level lower than me. Also holy is garbage for pvp anyways but thats another topic.
---
Those odds are respectably higher than you realize.
---
Not at all. Even if dual wielding they can currently use the heroic strike/cleave queue up to make that much hit pretty much useless.
---
afaik the new one is better than mc gear for a lot of classes.
---
I knew they were earrings since vanilla because of some web comic. But I would assume people would see them as something you keep on your belt/hip like the sword but more on the front?
---
Thought it was Thanos
---
elaborate please.  
---
9%hit is the cap, for yellow hits to land..... anything higher doesnt matter for 1h
---
Alright, but we're talking about retail and tier sets.
---
On retail they removed tier sets this last expansion, part of the justification they gave was gear slot flexibility. I'm saying that decision does not make sense from a MUA/DUA, or "shareholder design", perspective as it's the same amount of gear required with the same chance of incremental upgrades (random crap, like titanforging or sockets). 
---
You achieving pre-raid BiS from dungeons in Classic has what to do with this conversation, exactly?
---
Man I wonder how people did it back in the day! must have been horrible now wonder the game only had millions of people playing it
---
TIL, there is a path in the mountains between sun rock and the harpy valley.
---
Pretty sure you can't delete shaman totems from your bags.
---
All this is true for now, but I believe the market will correct itself *at some point*. People will get tired of the formulae, which in turn will spawn a new formulae. If this happens in the next 5 years or 50, who knows.
---
Life isnt stone. Life is water.

A small tip to add to what everyone else said; Try to run in as big a circle as possible. You can auto shot her at least once safely whenever you're further than 30y away. If you keep turning you won't get much range. Besides baiting skills, running straight lines is where you gain distance on her.
---
Sometimes it's just poor mental health as well. I'm a pretty well-rounded person. I can socialize just fine in public. But I also have ptsd and an anxiety disorder. When I hit some of my lows, it becomes harder to control my emotions. I don't lash out at people though, just screaming in my basement for a bit.
---
Anyway, basically I just ignore these people because who knows what they're dealing with and you'll never come out on top with them.
---
Fishing, you can fish oily blackmouths in ratchet to lvl 300 then do circuits in the azshara water and fish essence of water. Depending on your server how popular fishing is this can net you anywhere between 40 and 100 g/hr
---
I don't normally play arms, but I have sweeping strikes and whirlwind outside the main actionbar, cause I want to access them from all stances. And I frequently need to dance to use them.
---
It differs some between my stances bars, but not alot. You can also add modifiers to your macros so if you say so shift+x, it only casts the ability but doesn't change stance. Useful for let's say bloodthirst which you can use in every stance and you don't want to lose rage by swapping stance first.
---
Ok guys, can we stop acting like the serious players are telling casuals how to play? This has never been the case and im sick of people getting defensive over somethjng that just isnt happening. Ive never seen a single post telling people to be hardcore players, just these dumb ones saying that no one can tell them how to play. This is getting so old, we get it, if you want to be casual you can ne casual, no one is telling you other wise.

---
Just buy their massively undercut items asap. and resell it. Maybe you should be sent to a gulag in Northrend for re-education in capitalism.
---
People who undercut by large amounts generally are not AH players, Their one off item listing won't be a common thing, so you can often just get discounted stock.

That's my plan as well! I snagged a staff of jordan for 99g. I currently list it for ~350-500g depending on if I'm the only seller listed atm or not.
---
I don't quite expect it to sell for 500g any time soon, but it might also mean if someone may see it at 350 and snag it if the last time they saw it, and others posted, at 400+.

My guild discord has discusions for players to be weary of, those to outright ignore, and those who are fun to play with. Works like a charm for us.

We are already seeing the begining of a game industry crash. Many gamers arent accepting mtx anymore so they are aiming for the *"whales"*. At some point when enough people dont buy the drivel being pumped out, they will be forced to adapt.

Ofcourse they are. They want maximum RoI and tailoring the game to trigger the pleasure centra of the brain is now the main objective.

Doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. Except if you have a super slow weapon.

I always feel at a guild level it's a bit dangerous, because I'd disagree quite a bit with my guildies on who is good to run with! I'm sure the "gogogo aoe it down" mages and locks don't like my tanking style for example ;)
---
this guy has to be on a great payroll

Check it out on wowhead - but take it with a pinch of salt. Pserver reports might have skewed the data.

Hm. That may be the one exception. Honestly forgot those existed.

I will never understand the greed of people regarding BoEs. You're a mage. You make GREED on the ring. Not NEED. You don't need it.

I always associated it with Batman myself.
---
"Just keep at your own pace" is probably the worst advice i've ever heard. 
---
The servers will be dead by the time you are 60 if you aren't already..
---
I mean my realm is close to dead already, Barely any Shouts for high end dungeons, can go up to 40 min without seeing a shout for any thing relevant. 
---
It's better if you have already been 60 for a good month or 2, so you could actully enjoy the game when people played it and it was somewhat alive.
---
You always want to stand behind your target regardless of swords or daggers - you will also find the DPS warriors and feral druids stacked up there as well. Reason is that a blow cannot be parried if you are behind a mob (and the server also believes you are back there, eg you are not right on top of the hit box) so parries are eliminated from the hit table.
---
Very few bosses are stunable, a lot of boss ADDS are tho. There are some exceptions like Sartura in aq where the fight is designed around long cc-chains
---

I saw a recent pic posted of a 8/8 resto shaman. Is the mana return really that good on the 5/8 of? Also having 8/8 is like a lesser chain heal. Are these effective or is it better to stick to the non set, pure healing items? I am a shaman main tank healer.

I did UBRS with a lvl 57 2h tank. He got rezzed a lot otherwise pretty good rend-run.

I fell for this. I can't log in now to check, but there was an epic dagger on AH for 90ish G and 69G. I though I found a great deal for my rogue and bought the 69G dagger. I told my friend about it and he laughed and said that they are sold 35-45G. I have kept my eyes on the dagger ever since in AH and indeed they are sold 35-45G. I feel stupid, but I have an epic dagger.
---
Working as intended
---
fucking hate these tanks/players with a passion. why the hell do they have to stare at every little trash pack for like half a minute before doing something? drives me crazy
---
like, no, you dont have to wait just cause i sit down and drink. im at 60+% mana, just fucking pull already, we'll be fine
---
True. I look at it more as a suggestion list. Although most of those who made it on the ignore list were for reasons like severe toxicity and ninja looting. The weary list is for those who may not be the best but that you may have to babysit a bit more.
---
I've tried the addon and it's really nice, but I don't like that the normal tracking "Dot" doesn't show up when running near the vains. Some vains are in caves and hard to discover without the dot showing, this would have to be a high prio to get fixed.
---
just an advice, dont look at only preraid bis got pvp, also post raid. Anyone that raid regularly will have some of those pieces since its mainly t1.
---
Cool people
---
Really sad how some people have started adopting these in normal conversation. A while ago during an Overwatch game, some guy called saying "pepega" on voice chat. Like probably 30-40 times during the match.
---
He's Sith Lord of course
---
And you can save your stun for when you have nothing left, you want to prevent the mob from attacking someone, or when it enrages. This thing has a short CD and is extremely useful.
---
I guess gold farming really depends on the realms, pretty cool how they all have completely different economies.
---
Well you have to pick any color and you get three of them, but YES!
---
Same. I figured it was common knowledge. I can understand how people wouldn't think of something like a Basalisk Eye as an ear ring though.
---
How do you deal damage then. Please tell me, I never played wow before and sturggle to see how to do against a mage? Just dot him, heal and repeat?
---
Hey, I'm in this screenshot
---
I never even tried for it back in vanilla when I could play 15 hours a day. I get maybe 1-2 hours a day now so it just isn't even possible.
---
You wont have long combat times if everyone is well geared and uses potions. We take on average about 2-3 minutes for every boss.
---
Also melees are not very good on the majority of mc fights. You want to have a large amount of casters. There are a ton of fights in which melees can bately do any damage.

Do you think rp pvp servers will get impacted as much as normal pvp servers? Also just the fact that phase two encourages ganking lower levels is bad enough for me to worry about it.

&gt; It is the opposite of what makes classic fun.

That's pretty relative. Who are you to say what "makes Classic fun?"

As usual this is amazing

Bought this for 120 gold. Made already double of that, and the recipe is now 500-600 Gold. So far so good.

It was always just a crumpled up Piece of silk Cloth to me. I never questioned that!

It's not greedy to NEED on a highly valuable BoE. It's up to the winner to decide if he wants to sell it (and afford his epic mount) or give it away.

It’s only 24h in a day. As a successful person yourself you must realise that pouring down 8+ hours a day into being “successful” in a video game severely limits the time you can spend on IRL things.

this figure is comically high. And pools in Azshara are like gambling. There's 6 spawns of them on a 2-3h respawn timer, good luck making consistent gold with that method.

Blizzard has said that this is not banable. The skin does not belong to you until you start skinning.  Kill one and don’t loot it. Move to the next. When the troll gets tired of waiting go back to loot and skin.

Some people start reserving right away, some people start reserving after they've done the dungeon 100 times and already lost the item like 17 times.
---
If they tell you something reserved *after* you join the group, they're in the wrong. They should always tell you in the LFG advert.
---
Otherwise, just don't join the group. Reserving is an incredibly common practice. It's up to them if they want to spend longer putting the group together, you don't *have* to join them.

I had no clue. I honestly don't know what I thought it was supposed to be before now.

---
At this point the only thing that would bring me back to retail is some sort of reset, which they will never do, because people are too attached to their mounts/pets/transmogs, all of which turn the game visually into a gigantic clusterfuck. Any theme or style of a particular expansion is ruined when people are flying around on enormous Pandaria dragons.
---
They're on a 1 hour respawn timer. And it's not dynamic either so you can time them pretty easily. This is not a farm you wanna do in the middle of the day of course, instead try to do it later at night or early in the morning when there is less competition.
---
Wow he admitted straight away lol

Have you ever reached the end of that massive cave with massive number of Jaedenfire warlocks? I know there was a notorious escort quest that asked you to help a NE prisoner retrieve her armors and help her out, and there's the farthest I could go. But that was just like halfway through it. Man that place was so large like a dungeon!
---
If your keyboard supports it you could rebind tilde to control alt or shift and donut thatway
---
In case what? It ruins your game experience by blocking the stuff that's ruining your game experience?
---
100% this. After 24 hours of this post being up, I can for sure say there is a large portion of mage users that think it’s actually difficult to play. To them I say, go play league for 5 minutes. Then come back to playing a mage. Shits a cake walk.
---
Any showing of it is still reshowing the ad
---
I need an addon that does this! I used to have one that said Power Overwhelming when I used a trinket, need that too!
---
I agree to an extent. I don't think a reset will ever happen. Perhaps maybe we will see a WoW 2 someday when all of the WoW players worldwide can once again reunite.
---
The nice part about being a paladin is that a lot of our equipment is useless for other classes(except for specific cloth and jewelry items that priests and other spell-casters will kill us if we roll on). If it is mail or plate with spell power or other caster stats, it automatically belongs to us. Unless a hunter comes along and wants to make a mail spell power build.
---
Oh yeah that's the warlock mount quest cave. No, I was farming jadefire run like most others do.
---
LOL
---
I had a similar experience with runes. First time I went there it took me 2 hours to get 5 runes, killing like a hundred satires. Second time I got 4 runes from first 4 satyrs, and then a 5th one shortly after.
---
Yup. Thats pretty much it. Not leaving or rerolling tho... Already invested too much of our time in our mains.
---
Thanks for all the info. To be honest all of this seems so overwhelming. Some of the spells which you mentioned I dont even have on my bars because I.never use them while lvling.
---
The server you played on must have been on the other side of the world then.  Standard 56k modem pings to servers in your geographical area were sub 200.
---
You made the right decision.
---
Clearly already addressed this with what i said about "being on the other side of the world".
---
One for the priest, one for the rogue
---
Cries in Druid
---
I just can't be bothered to level again. Took me a lot of effort and discipline. Not gonna do that again.

So I'll just leave the game until I can move my character somewhere else.
---
I have no clue how someone could look at the Sub tree and not immediately say to themselves, "Well, this is obviously the pvp tree."

Oh you sweet summer child

On my server its about 30-40 silver for one.
---
Yikes, who told you this it would work?
---
It's not a very unpopular opinion.
---
Fury prot sucks for 5 man dungeons, that's a fact, and anyone who has tried arms or deep prot will agree.
---
Your aggro isn't that great without raid buffs, shield slam is just better. Defensive talents aren't that useful, dualwield tanking is worse than just cleaving with an arms build.
---
It's a weak and awkward tanking spec outside of raids.
---
Are you sure you had adsl and not just two cans connected with string?
---
I won't be a tourist this time I think. BFA was just too boring but I used to do the same.
---
Chipndales

Exactly.  BfA was the second expansion that I’ve said screw this I’m out.  The first was Cataclysm. No more blindly buying expansions for this guy.

Warlocks cannot solo a Tribute run.     
---
      
---
Apparently you don't use logic.    You say "OMG LOOK AT THE LOGS" yet when you look at the logs you'll see,  Hunter's median Damage is pretty damn close to Rogues.   It's closer to Rogue, then Warlocks are to Hunters, by double.        
---
The Stats show,  Hunter's do very respectable dmg, while maintaining the best kit in the game.    No other class gets to be the best solo class, while being top 3 class in DMG in raids.    For example,  Druids;  Have a pretty good kit, but they've got to spec one way or another, Unlike hunters who generally get the best of both worlds in 1 spec;  Yet, they're much more "average" in the DMG department.       
---
        
---
I don't think it's at all unexpected that a Hunter's position is that their class is Underpowered.
---
That thing that you call "preventing you from playing" *is* the game.  The real game.
---
And in charge
---
Fun Fact: All Ogre Mages in the game have 2 heads. This is cause it requires a lot of intellect to cast spells and thus they need 2 heads since one of their heads has so little base intellect.
---
If we keep discovering body parts in the wow UI we’ll eventually be able to create some type of Exodia the Forbidden One meme.
---
Dude I was diamond in s2 and s3 of league and I’ll call it again, you have no clue. Mage is a strong class one of the best, tho it’s not easy to be EFFICIENT I repeat if you don’t get it : EFFICIENT. And if you suck, you’ll suck as a mage anyway. It takes skill to be good at ANY CLASS just like every champion at league even the ones Op in the current meta. Srsly, what’s your point dude?

The problem with paladins is not that they can’t tank. It’s that they are 100% useless on any fight that requires a taunt swap.  If you are playing with people that will allow for an extra tank that doesn’t do anything for those particular fights then I don’t see why you couldn’t tank naxx.  But it’s going to take a bit to find that bunch of people.

Google sure can

Got charge and intercept macros bound to respective stance. Before I had hamstring macro here as well - taken from some macro guide - however this was a mistake as it would drop hamstrings when I stance danced for whirlwind or overpower.

I guess you are just a native speaker then. I swear I spent more years than I'm gonna admit thinking that "trinket" was just a synonym of "earring" because of this.

Ah okay ty for the correction!

My character name is actually "JeVousAime" wish mean "i love you" (plural form).
---
I use macros for the majority of my abilities.
---
For example;
---
.#showtooltip Whirlwind
---
/cast [stance:1] Berserker stance; [stance:2] Berserker stance; [stance:3] Whirlwind
---
This will swap me stances if I am not in berserker stance and cast whirlwind if I am.
---
Use pretty much the same macro across all of my abilities.
---
Swift thistle go for 30s each on my server. Briarthorn betweem 5-10 silver. So a single Briarthorn can net you like 1.20g if you are lucky.

I’m leveling up as prot warrior (lv 15) when I get “bored” as hunter (main/lv 28) but I’m having a hard time maintaining threat. 
---
Does anyone know any friendly guide to someone that has &gt;never&lt; played as tank (I’m also very new to WoW) and doesn’t know how to use any macros, doesn’t know any rotation of skills etc.
---
Yeah that's how mages win duels if you can't kill them outright. They let you use your mana, then sheep and reset. Key is being more mana efficient than them. It's a mage, they have no sustain outside of ice barrier (which you don't even get at 39) so any dot will eventually whittle them down. If you're very good on mana, you can shapeshift to dodge polymorph (travel form is super cheap isn't it?)
---
Oh this is grade A shit post material.
---
R E A L S H I T
---
Any idea if the chromatic sword will be worth anything? It does not seem to have the glow in classic.
---
Bought life-&gt;earth for 120g
---
Yep, you share honor with your group/raid. Rogues usually go duo rogue tho, which is more effective, in pair they can destroy most of the 3-4 players squads. And don't need to roam around for singles to kill if solo.
---
Sure thing "Mr. My Opinion is all that matters!".
---
You mean nut very slowly?
---
To be fair Diablo 4 had an amazing trailer
---
He means the other transmutes that are inexpensive or easy to get (fire to earth &amp; earth to water) already make a decent amount of gold and share a cool down with this expensive one. Therefore, it doesn’t take 60 days to make 1200 since you could already make some number wiu the other transmutes. It will take longer to break even with the expensive recipe than you calculated.
---
2nd only to pw:s. I've gotten way too use to clicking it off
---
I’m at 57 myself. Feels like it’s never going to happen lol
---
Man it was tough. The fiancée has been really cool about it all though. I’ve just been telling her I won’t have to play as much once I get 60.... lol
---
3 dudes were waiting for the chicken to appear for the chicken escort quest I just went to check if the chicken was there and they instantly tried to jump on me, I called two of my friends over and waited until they were just about to finish the quest and then killed them
---
Man I play vanilla for 5 straight years you think you can fool me? Leveling is just the start of the game, some classes level quicker on the right hands, mage is one of those classes that in the right conditions ( no competition for aoe spots/ quest mobs) and ofc skill for efficiency. But it’s just leveling, mages have a easy time leveling if you can play them right, that’s a fact. But warriors are a pain to level alone and they are just as interesting and they can be like little titans with the right gear and skill. By your judgement the class who gets a easier time leveling is the strongest. Lmfao
---
We get it.

Iron Maiden album cover
---
You're welcome :D
---
You mean stuff like LOL and lmao? Yeah that's equally bad to be saying out loud. Especially if you are a grown adult.
---
Outside the scope of the question
---
In Vanilla Alpha/Beta versions of the game there were more race + class combinations but Class designer decided to remove some to prevent huge race imbalance ratio on factions because LOTR made Humans and Dwarves too popular in those years so Dwarf Mages/Warlocks and things like Human Hunters were removed and Gnome race was forced to have Mage/Warlock combination.
---
this is what i was thinking
---
I don’t play as much so it certainly felt like a grind. Took me two weeks to go from 55-60 and 2 days for 59-60.
---
Helping her is basic it's not depend on a day. Mother's day just a day when I give her flowers because the society wants me to do it.
---
&gt;I still to this day, thought the Pinnacle of writing was wotlk.
---
No it wasn't. The Lich King was some cartoonish villain always showing up and being like "haha, I could kill you right here, but I won't. Instead I'll send my minion and retreat"
---
And in the end it was revealed that he intentionally sent all his minions for us to slaughter because he wanted to turn the most powerful army on his side. And he almost succeeded if it wasn't for a lighty boy
---
You were begging yo be AoE'd.
---
I've typically used it for 2H tanking instances and more often than not end up significantly out-DPSing everyone in the group (SM/RFD). Lvl 43 atm.
---
Guess I can check how much of my damage is from the ravager procc on a run, and compare it to an increase in DPS from another weapon, but I assume it's hard to keep up the mass-AoE on big pulls that RAvager allows for....
---
For some of the bigger pulls I can end up pulling (with Charge, Bloodrage, Sweeping strike, Zerkstance, whirlwind, cleave) and then just keep spinning thought the entire pull due to re-proccs.
---
Funny, I did that quest yesterday. Whilst there were only a few people, enough kept spawning that I rarely had downtime; I just had to run from end-to-end constantly. A little hidden area outside helped me finish off the last few items. Then I went to kill harpies up north and it was dead!
---
However down south, killing those freaking griffins for 40 metallic fragments on what felt like a sub 50% drop rate meant that there were people everywhere just farming away. That quest took me like 3 days of logging on, doing a few, getting annoyed and logging off!
---
That's from Warcraft 2 , wow has gone through so many retcons I wouldn't be surprised if a ogre's insides were a portal to the Lightlands or something

Me personally measure success in overcoming barriers, not wealth per se.
---
The last couple of years I have dedicated a lot of time, sweat and blood in fighting MMA. Growing up I was always a scrawny kid that got beat up if there ever was a fight. My first couple of sparring session at the club was pure hell, I was so scared. That slowly turned into the norm and I got to push myself harder and harder. I have fought 2 times now. Lost the first one pretty hard. My second fight I won by KO. I’m currently training for my 3rd.
---
Mork prefer da old way. Mork no use newfangled tek... tekno.. tekmumbojumbo like addon.
---
With BWL gear sure, but realistically you will deck out a couple shamans in T1 and give offset pieces to other shamans, otherwise it's a waste of loot.
---
B? Fuck I have no idea....
---
A stealthed class could kill all six defenders solo. There are videos of druids doing so. Jammal I'm 99% sure is soloable, as he has very low HP. I just don't know the proper way to do it. The time it takes the mobs in the instance to reach you is about 20-30 seconds. My guess is you just have to burst him down in that time, but I'm not sure if there are ways of making it any easier. For example like another user posted, having a grounding totem makes it so the boss can't sleep anyone in the party.
---
God damn 9 years ago? I remember when that blew up, I guess that makes me a Reddit boomer :(
---
Oh god. Nah, I want be soloing UBRS until late BC, haha
---
Ah, so the mana is always applied as being full. Limited use for this tho :/
---
You lose to mages but not warriors/rogues? Uhh..

Check his latest one. Veggie stew instead of brain. I pity him if he thinks this is trolling.
---
Well, good thing WoW offers so many options, right.
---
I was staring at it yesterday trying to figure it out after the trinket post. I couldn't figure it out until now so thank you
---
You finally put into words my issue with retail, it's not the grind, it's not the lack of spells, etc., it's the rush mentality. And not just sitting back and enjoying the game. Because if you do that you're behind and don't get to experience this patches raid then if you do that then you don't get to experience next patches raid... Etc etc. Pacing and rush mentality. That's why I like classic.
---
Dark runes have the same effect and are not BOP, it's much easier to farm something else and buy them instead.
---
Demonic runes are required for a few patterns so it's kind of a waste to pop them for mana when you can use them for crafting.
---
Frost mage is good at neither of those. Do an aoe farm like ZF.
---
Real life dwarf confirmed
---
I remember that too. I had to page through the manual while the game installed because it took so damn long.
---
A lot of these icons look really different when you blow them up from the standard UI size we're use to and really take a look at them.
---
I was looking at Runecloth the other day.  I always thought it was the corner of two pieces, one in front of the other, and I realized it's really just one piece with a yellow line of detail on it, with a really ornate hemmed edge.
---
I mean this’ll be taken down right?
---
Totally agreed. I don't care getting optimal gold for my sales and I appreciate not spending hours in the AH game.
---
Telling the hard truth about real life since you want wow to be like real life so much.
---
"Guys warlocks are good on the fight melee can't do anything!"
---
Someones been playing their DotA :)
---
Fair enough, we neither have the comp nor are we advanced enough for this yet. I will keep this in mind should the time and opportunity to try it out present itself!
---
Now that was just uncalled for man. There's no reason for you to personally attack me. I had already conceded your point. How does it make you look when you kick a man who already acknowledged you were right?
---
Was a comment about warlock v mage.
---
I really got a kick out of

&gt;As a leftist gamer myself, some of what I have to put up with on a daily basis in the gaming community sickens me, and I want to be supportive of other leftists, even if they are in the Horde.
---
You can start running for some of your BiS. The ring from princess is right in your level range at the moment. By the time I had my ring I was ready for the first half BRD   By the time I had what I wanted from arena/Angerforge I was ready for the end of BRD and it’s all gravy from there if you tank them yourself to gear your dps set.
---
God forbid.
---
You'll be required to get dBm and a threat meter when you raid.
---
How’s the “world pvp”?
---
So delete amulet, buy 100 blue/greens, sell them and they can never raid ony on this char again. Got it.
---
I had a dream last night where the blink spell actually works... Hmmm was so good
---
Does it share with Arcanite?
---
Congratulations. With 2 hunters you failed to do what one hunter can do by himself.
---
I'm curious to see how you actualy finished this.
---
Rockbiter makes less overkill dmg.
---
Isn't the point of playing a fifteen year old game that it'll never die?
---
After like 23h it can still be fine. If there are one/two more players you can still get up to 100mobs/h.
---
Sure. I guess if you've already completed the quests that drop pre-bis and don't count corpse running to instances as PvP.
---
The most popular spec for leveling is Arms.
---
Here's a decent guide.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-arms-warrior-leveling-talent-build-1-60
---
Warcraft's dialogue doesn't actually feel like dialogue, it's just two people shouting lines at each other and no one reacting to what the other says. It's as though someone wrote a flow chart monologue for character A, then came up with a bunch of interjections for character B that loosely fits what person A is saying and called it dialogue.
---
&gt; I’m on a PvE server and world PvP will be pretty much dead.
---
That sounds like a problem you put on yourself.
---
Min/maxed they can go to around 1 hit/second. Then they use that seal that does extra holy dmg per hit and they become a machine gun
---
To be fair you can just get a new key from an NPC in Desolace too.
---
I don't necessarily buy that it's too late if you want to farm materials. If you are thinking of stockpiling from the AH then its too late.
---
As others have said, top PVP contenders will use a lot of consumables, alchemy, mining and fishing are great. Free Action Potions, Speed potions, Sapper Chargers, Grenades, Health Pots, High level cooking food will all be in demand. A lot of the super hardcore have stacks of gold and materials, but plenty will be casual enough to spend gold instead of farming.
---
leaf hes gramma out off this
---
the idea of pvping in scourge torn plaguelands is so amazing tho
---
You don't need to level it to 300, most of the useful items have lvl requirement around 280 or lower. But to answer your question, it depends on your server's economy. Classic wowhead has a detailed leveling guide with all required mats, which you can look up on the auction house.
---
Range is 20 yards.
---
hey, sorry I saw your profile and I just thought you looked cute in your comments I really wanted to tell you that)) It's really rare to see girls playing video games haha! I don't know why its a guy thing honestly im like really against misogyny and like ill be the one in the kitchen making sandwiches. We should really play WoW sometime its a really cool game with a lot of intense moments, but don't worry ill be there to protect you ;) sorry that wasnt flirting I swear Im just trying to be friendly I really like your profile! sorry was that too far? Really sorry i'm really shy I don't go out much haha add me on skype we should talk more you look really nice and fun xxx
---
BiS doesn't change just because some lack dedication
---
&gt; Ret: if he proc, you ded, If he no-proc, you no-ded. Truly amazing design. Must have taken them years to come up with this idea. Insane damage if the god of luck and fortune stands by his side. Not fun for anyone. Fun rotation tho.
---
I hit my first crit proc yesterday twice in a row it felt amazing for the past 100 times it never hit.
---
They are real, this is actually a black hellebore (helleborus; also known as a Christmas Rose.)
---
However they’re not at all related to lotus.
---
Yeah it is so stupid. I can see the fear cast and place down my tremor totem. The fear still wont break. I dont know why. My totems have a 30 yard range. It just wont fucking break.
---
Like actually just taunt them lol. Taunt &gt; shield slam &gt; revenge is just the tank rotation. And should give you enough time for the next time you need to taunt. If your tank can't hold aggro in a single mob fight, they aren't using that rotation.
---
And it's sadly that fear that made WoW retail what it is. The MMO players knew is gone and that's why, weirdly, Classic is working.
---
I always thought it was a purple silhouette of somebody touching their eye :|
---
It’s far dumber to do nothing and be silent. At least he tried to change the situation in his favor, albeit not in the best way. This is normal, because most people in MMOs have very weak social skills. But in general, in such situations, you should do everything possible to make a profit, otherwise you should not open your own business or engage in trade EVER.

This needs more attention! Blizzard we need answers!
---
Keep yar feet on the ground!
---
Check skill-capped.com, pretty decent PvP-BiS list for some classes.
---
Wow seriously?  So i guess the vast majority of your XP is just mobs because there's nowhere near enough dungeon quests to be more than a small chunk of that.
---
How's the XP/hr?  Is it actually faster than questing or just faster than getting ganked while trying to quest?
---
Should make addon that diesnt allow you to log off if you are not in a inn :D
---
Sunken Temple Dragon exp runs.
---
Enter -&gt; move up to the trolls and clear the entire cycle -&gt; kill one troll miniboss and jump down into the first green dragon pack -&gt; clear all the dragons -&gt; move to the exit reset and do this again
---
If you have a dedicated group (the better your healer and the more melees you use the better) you can do 3-4 levels like this within 8hours.
---
Dungeon wise do a few Sunken temple runs, and then the majority of 53-55 brd prison to arena then anger forge. Full brd runs after 55+ as mob lv increases in the back half. 
---
Scholomance, stratholme as well as DM East,west, and North, around 58. 
---
58+ you can also start doing Black Rock Spire 
---
Questing in swamp did Sorrows to get the dungeon quests for Sunken Temple, 
---
Felwood then Winterspring, 
---
WPL then EPL, unlocks quests for scholo and stratholm and argent farm rep. 
---
Burning Steepes then Searing Gorge to unlock all the Brd, Black Rock spire quests
---
Yes, I blatantly lied about using an entire hour to find the trainer for internet points............... what?
---
No dude... I was legitimately asking because I have no clue what your post was trying to say lol
---
Canadian gramms, it's like licking syrup.
---
Enjoy your full realm and inability to farm resources. Blizzard gave you an opportunity to transfer and all you can do is insult me. Real quality argument.
---
Well the choice is around 200 damage every 3.2 seconds or a lot more on the elite. There’s still 2 more dps that should be able to burn down non elites fairly quick. Then go back to a weaker elite.
---
The Multi-Shot will still target 2 non elites.
---
If you dont feel like starting your preBiS grind yet you certainly could (Arena, Angerforge, Argelmach runs), I'd recommend going 31/5/15 and keep questing and do dungeons when you want to.
---
In ramge with the priest that is doing the q , othervise youbsee the %target macro part
---
Bruh
---
Agreed. I was more or less pointing out the absurdity of the hypothetical above me with an absurd hypothetical of my own.
---
I mostly use reddit for relationship advice and to mock people that take themselves too seriously. So either you're a bitter cheater or you have a stick up your butt. The judgement you passed on me is about as valuable as the dirt underneath my fingernails, as in it's not. Hope you had fun moral grandstanding. 
---
Also I didn't check your post history because I don't particularly care to get to know you.
---
True but I mostly quest grinded my way to 60 and I tried both methods. The difference is minimal. Enh and quests don't get along
---
Pa ram pam pam pam
---
&gt; It might also seem obvious that you shouldn't be able to just buy the items you need for a quest
---
Not obvious at all. There are multiple quests where you can do this. Whenever i go to dustwallow marsch i go buy 3 spices before because i know i will need them for a quest there.
---
I literally only realised this now.
---
https://i.ibb.co/2dGQSPg/btnblink-result.png

So it seems they changed the dwarf into an elf(?) in Reforged.
---
grat's i've already had that since we cleared MC 1 week into wow (lol) nobody cartes!
---
Dude I think you just unlocked the true power of paladin tanking...
---
I always knew too
---
You cant do warrior shaman. Stop spreading myths. Just because some guy in naxx gear with thunderfury did it on his youtube guide doesnt mean its possible in p1.
---
Stop ruining the game for us oblivious people!
---
big if true
---
Yep this is expected when you reach a particular level of skinning (usually around 200). My guess is it’s a balance thing since skinning is much easier to level than the other gathering professions. This is probably their way of levelling the field a bit.
---
Still in the bronze age around these parts.
---
Deal.
---
Is it viable to heal 5-man runs as HotW/NS? I have been getting some pushback from my guild about respec'ing as HotW/NS doesn't have a 'main spec'. I will more than likely be running 5-man dungeons waaaaayy more than raids as my guild's raid times are Wednesday and Thursday at 9pm EST. I got a full time job and two kids, so that time is none viable for me.
---
I have a great set of tanking gear for HotW/NS respec and have been slowly building a good healing set (Hammer of Grace, Thaurassian's royal scepter, Omnicast Boots, etc...) and want to make sure that healing LBRS, UBRS, etc would be viable.
---
It's literally saying NEED and GREED on the buttons. The mage certainly don't need it.
---
I feel personally attacked I play rogue and I've never picked Madrid, I always pick Barcelona.
---
All these years I ve seen a man touching his forehead...
---
Just an PSA about raid viability. 
---
Itemization and loot tables in classic are extremely different than retail. For healing weapons in classic raids as of right now, you’ve got about 3 epics to choose from. 2 depending on what class you are. All with relatively low drop chances. When BWL releases you have 1 new healing weapon. It drops from Nefarion, and has about a 5% drop rate. 
---
People are still going to be running MC well past BWL.
---
Check shadowpanther.net, they’ve got all kinds of spreadsheets for pvp and pve
---
&gt; I guess these people just want a single player experience and hate being forced to work as a team?
---
Pretty sure this is a mentality brought over from Retail.
---
Still can't see it.
---
Sure, let's remove the civilian kills for the poor people that want to kill city leaders to farm honor but who cares about the lvl 20 being nuked by lvl 60 players "because they can".
---
I'm find with removing "civilian" from npc. If they give it to any player which is killed by enemy players with 15+ level of difference which makes the fight completely trivial for one side and a rape for the victim.
---
Yup, you know that after you put something on the AH, someone else will undercut you and so on. If you already start with 5 items cheaper, you will not sell anything ever unless someone really needs a crapload of stacks and buys up everything under a certain amount.
---
There's enough shamans for everyone. The question is if you mix the hunters with the melee or have them in their own group.
---
I did about 3/4 of a level to get one. Got some really nice vendor loot too. Sold mine for 30g which was nice because now they're like 10g lol
---
That makes sense. My guilds MT is a fully spec'd Feral Tank ( he is also the Druid class leader). The other Druid in the guild is full Resto. Sounds like HotW/NS will slot in nicely between the two.
---
Ninja afks are the worse, every .... single... pull in a pug, you have to be like "everyone ready?" I now know why the ready check thing was made in raids.
---
I took mine apart and cleaned the rubber piece beneath it. The rubber itself doesn't hold a bond well so I'm unable to press it and have it pop back up. I am thinking about creating a bond with glue so it pops back up or finding another keyboard for cheap and replacing the rubber underneath.
---
Orc locks don’t lose vs rogues (:
---
Oh 😯
---
Jesus, way to come through with the most objectively useful answer to an unbelievably niche question.
---
I’d like to see an actual blizzard weigh in about this instead of all of us just speculating haha
---
I don't see why it wouldn't, but If I read that correctly you will no longer own the game or any any associated with your blizzard account.
---
Why do you want to do this out of curiosity?
---
I have about 
---
* 400 FAPs
---
* 1200 Iron Grenades
---
* 10 Librams of Consititution
---
* 100 Goblin Sapper Charges
---
* 200 Major Healing Potions
---
* 300 Swiftness Potions
---
* 300 Tubbers (this is soulbound)
---
Defense will give you only dodge as the classic druid tank don't have parry nor block.
---
Not worth to go searching for it. Stamina &gt; Armor &gt; Agility
---
&gt;These aren’t the boomer being referred too. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Boomers are retired however there’s a new term that has come up in the past year or so for Internet boomers those who did not grow up with the Internet basically 28+
---
Hate to break it to you, but we grew up on the internet too. Basically anyone that didn't play fortnite is a boomer now according to 13 year olds in WoW.
---
Yeah seems that way.
---
I don't know where people get that idea from.
---
Arugal? I bough this recipe for 120g and felt super lucky.
---
Use travel form to remove the slows / freeze. (Lowest mana cost)
---
Try to keep the Moonfire debuff on him, don't spam moonfire as you'll lose if you're oom. (Same applies for Insect Swarm if you've got the talent for it)
---
Correct
---
Except the icon is from WC3, predating WoW by years.
---
Tell it to the dps guy who wanted to get to uldaman on lvl 40, where last boss is 47 if I remember correctly. Pretty much no chance he could do any damage. Yeah I get it, it's possible to make it on lower level but why would I want carry him through. So I usually have minimum lvl requirement in group. No more than 4 levels below last boss. Even 4 is not great unless I can't find more people.
---
Thinking of rerolling a shaman, never played one before but I think it would be fun to learn a brand new class. Opinions on shamans in classic? Seems like I would be a healer in raids as the dps specs aren't good
---
Why wouldn’t it? The option to delete all your data has existed for more than a decade, it’s not going anywhere. :P  Why the sudden cry for attention… er, worry?
---
Comment chains like these get me so erect.
---
I think you were lucky, yes.
---
I'd not sell it if I were you, I bought a few on my realm for between 10-20g some weeks back, now they have climbed back to 80ish for whatever reason - but can't tell if they are selling or not as I've not had any closer look at it. I foresee profits in the future though.
---
Whats that "nearby" addon in the left?
---
As a fury warrior, what do I want the speed of my offhand to be? Does it matter? I see bis lists show the ony axe deathbringer in both MH and OH. I always thought we wanted fast off hands for rage and crusader procs?
---
I hide all of my desktop icons and only have like three taskbar icons.
---
Fuck the Recycle Bin.
---
Didn’t you play on a PvE server specifically to avoid world PvP?
---
It's nice for picking up the flightpath, which you will need later on to get to desolace quickly.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2iyyazs1OE
---
You can use form to remove sheep, did it last time I met a mage.
---
Yeah they are.
---
You NEED it so it doesn't get ninjaed. Seems you've never been in a group where the last person presses NEED after the other four already GREED'ed?
---
What are the best professions for a tauren shaman?
---
I'm thinking herbalism (taurens get a racial herbalism boost) and alchemy to use the ingredients from herbalism
---
That’s why I’m an SL orc warlock with a pet out and shards in my bags :P I understand what you’re saying, but comparing classes but only giving one the benefit of preparing for a fight isn’t fair at all.
---
Sure, good players will give warlocks a hard time. Lucky crits can win fights, too. I’m not saying warlocks are unbeatable, just that the odds are in their favor most of the time, supposing they’re ready for a fight.
---
What’s miserable about SL in group PvP? Sure, it’s not as bursty as destro, but I haven’t had a single complaint.
---
noticing a theme of not fun for all classes... lol
---
What are you rerolling from? Shamans will be specced resto for PvE but can do pretty well as elemental i PvP
---
was it really though? I thought PVP has always been more popular server choice.
---
What a wonderful UI kappa
---
We'd take a druid even if he did nothing but buff mark...
---
That warlock was Tier poop.
---
Then dont roll on a PvE server. This is great for us who like pvp
---
You can heal most raids with that spec as long as you have the right gear.
---
Cute list
---
People that could do scholo in the first few weeks were hardcore players with high skill, so I can imagine you were able to do that. The current lvl 55-56's are way more casual at the game.
---
Not a question. Just wanted to share. 
---
I may be the slowest leveler in the history of the game (I'm ok with that as i had fun while leveling). I dinged 60 last night after around 16+ days /played. 
---
Got attuned to MC at like level 56 (easy to solo as a Rogue).
---
A few hours after hitting 60 last night, one of the literally six raid teams in my guild needed someone from the bench to help kill Ragnaros. I volunteered, was accepted, and got my first Rag kill last night!
---
What an amazing experience. I played briefly in Vanilla but never raided. So me being present for the Rag kill last night was very significant to me.
---
Why. There will still be AP grinds and gear resets every patch.
---
Obv anything that you repeat 30-40 times is annoying, that has nothing to do with lingo though, which is what seemed to be the focus here.
---
In DM:N you can aoe farm dogs, not sure if it's any good for gold though.
---
Did you just take a photo of you taking a photo of hitting 60? I feel kinda dabbed on...
---
It's one FP away from UC, two from IF. Flight points in taren mill and ss are both campable, graveyard is campable. Nothing too curious about it.
---
How do you farm dark runes? Far as I know it only drops in Scholomance. Other undead mobs in both plaguelands only drop that stone token for argent dawn rep.
---
guessing, well hoping, not a tank?
---
More random procs tha better!
---
Weap with proc + plus ench proc for more chances
---
You buy them on AH.
---
Excellent raid healing, quite nice tank healing if you get some T1 raid pieces. 
---
Excellent utility that can be tailored according to your group or the fight at hand - Windfury, Manatide, Tremor, Earthbind, Grounding are all highly useful, plus the resistance totems and Strength of Earth/Mana Spring. Oh, and did your entire group get a Poison or Disease debuff? Boom, all gone in one GCD, and gone again after another 5 seconds for the upcoming 2 minutes. IMO the best interrupt available with its 20 yd range and only 6 second cooldown. Ghost Wolf for early levels is a definite plus. 
---
As a healer you should have an easy time finding a place in any dungeon and raid group.
---
I may be tempted to get it after it's been released for a while, and when it goes on sale.  They usually do a Christmas time sale where they discount their latest expansion by 40 or 50%....that's when I've bought everything since MOP (didn't get legion though).
---
There are some meme-specs, e.g. tanking dungeons as enhancement. Also, some guilds bring an enhancement shaman to raids, to apply Nightfall procs (from the crafted weapon) to bosses. If you are that guy, be prepared to die a lot. Other than that, yes, in the endgame you're sadly only a healer.
---
This is hilarious but what boggles my mind is why didn't any of you use feign death?
---
At 40 I got dotted by some 60 aff lock in gadgetzan and he just walked away, literally not a thing in this world I could do. I now keep a minimum of 5 restoration potions on my and bum rush locks that look at me. The undead rogue never forgets.
---
Eh. Lesser of 2 evils. Wanting something better shouldn't be predicated on having picked the worst option for yourself. Not everyone likes or wants to have to deal with 20 minutes of corpse walking just to start MC each week.
---
That wasn't the main focus of my comment, mostly an addition as to why someone would bother feeling so passionate about the topic.
---
This was my thinking to.
---
Dude, that is some next-level weirdass nitpicking/trolling/spergery you got going there.
---
i would read the shit outta that book, by R.L. Stein
---
Often did many runs with the same people or replaced just those that left. Also was after banthok sash and omnicast boots anyay
---
I've *tanked* both Strath and Scholo at lvl 58 on my Druid. And I was healing them as low as 56.
---
Sadly it doesn't give us credit on the meters, but the mages are happy!
---
Really great to hear experiences like this.
---
No it wasn't.
---
A thousand kilometers away at most, depending on which server i connected to. And I wasn't the only one with this ping, it was generalized.
---
Yeah you’re pretty bad. Druids are really hard to kill for Mages, especially ones who are 8 levels higher.
---
I will say. For the most basic functions that most people need. It’s quite easy. All the other fiddly bits and bobs are quite unnecessary for basic day to day use. 
---
On main auction screen. Press scan so at least once a day when playing to build a database of items and prices. Search for items like usual. But use the percentage sorter to see what is underpriced or overpriced compared to the market value you have in your database. 
---
Second is the apraisal tab. Here you select a item in your inventory and use the two sliders to decide how many stacks you want to sell and how many items are in a stack. On the right is the price per item. The addon sets its recommended price, but you can change it as much as you want. Unless it is a specialty item, I generally don’t change it though. Then just press post at the bottom right. 
---
That is all you really need to know to use auctioneer. There are many more functions and buttons. But those are for people who do nothing but sit at the AH to buy and sell stuff. For daily vendoring of cloth and other high use mats and items. This is all you need. Hope that helps if you decide to give it another try. 
---
And ya I understand. When I first looked at some of these addons. The sheer amount of options and widgets and more was and still is a headache to figure out. The one that hurts to look at for me is weak auras. That thing is a maze and a half that I’m still not sure if it even does what it say it does.
---
You get 8% int, spiritual focus, and the fear resist on top of the 12% healing. The BoF uptime is nice situationally, but you have cleanse and DS, in organized PvP as a ret you should be running with a holy paladin healer in your group anyway, who will also be bringing BoP and BoF. The extra six seconds on freedom is not a huge deal especially when youll be spammed with purge/dispel in PvP.
---
LMFAO, I give those 1 hour Gift of the Wild buffs too.
---
They will still exsist ina new for. The power bar you grind I bet they keep that. Daily world quest grinds for flying confirmed. Probably gonna have seasons again so resets every major patch/season change.
---
you are welcome

Welcome aboard!
---
Ok boomer.

is this a picture of you taking a picture of your computer?
---

goot show up that glowing 2h mace in bear form
---
The leveling journey is over, that's a big thing IMHO. While leveling, you can basically do what you want. Once you are 60, you are expected to get your BiS, farm consumables, show up to raids, etc. It's like growing up...
---
We just killed Rag for the first time and he didn’t submerge. I was deep prot and held aggro in Fire Resist gear until about 1% when two melee pulled threat and got instagibbed. 
---
tl;dr - fury/prot is not 100% required for good threat gen if you know what you’re doing and how to itemize.
---
There is an old wise saying:
---
It's the Healers fault if the Tank dies.
---
It's the Tanks fault if the DPS pulls aggro.
---
It's the DPS fault when... I dunno since I play DPS.
---
Yes but doing it this way you also get the option of swapping stances without casting the ability. If i want to taunt i press taunt twice, if i want to go def stance i press it once.
---
The only thing I can really recommend here is take note of where you got the kill at, if they come over to fuck with you hearth to Tanaris and make a trip back. Alternatively (I do this as a Rogue), I just ride away and stealth back. It makes it an outstanding pain in the dick but it just depends on what lengths you will go to to make sure you get your skins.
---
Or a tail
---
That's a pretty good combo for any class. 
---
If you want to do stuff in PvP (or have a fair shot at it when getting jumped in the open world) Engineering would be a good pick. Supplemented with mining for saving some gold on the required materials.
---
Full tank spec with plate, shield etc (gnome tho)
---
The lowest effort of low effort memes, Jesus H Cartman.
---
I've always seen it as the little light opticians use during eye tests
---
If there's a guild farming it for their members at any time of the day, you're SOL. Otherwise you might have some luck talking to people in the arena before it starts.

I was in an RFK group with an enhancement tank recently. Worked surprisingly well.

That's even worse because you don't have to go to wowhead to check that... It literally says on the mount which races can ride it lmao
---
where's that?
---
Hmm at max level I spend just 200 mana per mob when I grind (hunter) so having this on the fly makes it infinitely sustainable.
---
I even wanted to get that weapon from MC that gives mana on kill. This renders it moot
---
Gz
---
Dorf mage master combo confirmed.
---
Makes total sense as we are apex predators. Why have a pet when you can eat it!?
---
Gnomes are jacked
---
My wife plays next to me. We're both about to ding 60!
---
And they have a 10 minute patrol or so. You can kill King before they come back.
---
I just finished ZF quite late as level 49. Should I push immediately to Sunken Temple or wait until level 50, 51? I prefer bossing instances and being on the higher level requirement side, as I don't get huge amount of time to play I need my dungeons runs to go smooth and well.
---
I appreciate this.
---
I desperately want to play more wow - I have a holy 60 paladin that I keep for Raiding content, a 20 mage, Warlock and 30 Rogue but for some reason I just can't stick to  any one of them for a reasonable length of time. Is this just a case of burnout where the only cure is to give it a week and play something else? Has anyone else blitz the game for the months it's been out and struggling to keep their concentration up? if anyone has been through the classic woes and got through it through will power or determination?; or is the solution is just stepping away? I'd be grateful to hear peoples thoughts on it.
---
damn, vuze, ventrilo, fraps and skype, what a flashback.
---
holy shit that UI
---
&gt; cheap AoE threat
---
Depends on your metric. It's 1.5 Silver / Cast =)
---
Fire is fine until you want to raid. When you start raiding it's actually useless. Unless you plan on spending hundreds on constantly respeccing, fire is just a bad spec right now.
---
Except it's never the Mages.  It's always a Warlock or Hunter.
---
They still are! I'm pretty sure the whole reason Zandalari can't be warlocks is because of H/A class-to-race balance would have been thrown off.
---
People be doing some crazy things trying to get Rank 14.
---
Black lotus was around 40g ea pre layer removal 9n stalagg.  Now they're around 100g ea

I thought lasher farming was nerfed (well, technically it's normal while most private servers had the original pre-patch version that was too good).
---
This guy can play Diablo Immortal.
---
kill mobs
---
Let's say it was passable when I was just making toast for myself, but if there were 39 others joining the party it could not keep up -
---
True true.
---
Thought that had more to do with all blood elves had an insatiable thirst for magic so if they were gonna be warriors they might as well be magic warriors. Can't explain rogue then though.
---
Did they say anything? Because there's no reason a mage should ever roll on a trinket like that.
---
There is no pet called Voidhunter though?
---
I'm 20 you dweeb. Some people think of their careers you know?
---
&gt; I remember in vanilla us giving tank a full minute before we were allowed to dps
---
Jesus Christ your tanks were terrible.  I was an MT in Vanilla.  I only asked my DPS to wait maybe 5 seconds.  Once a raid boss starts beating on you, you should have more than enough rage to lock that mother fucker down.
---
I was hoping someone would follow the song up!
---
I like Griffith and the gang
---
If in this case "easy mode" is much faster than "very easy mode", by virtue of having a 58 tank there ready to go VS waiting another 40m-infinity. Then isn't choosing "easy mode" in fact making the healers job easier? Seeing as the only difference in difficulty is how long it takes to complete, availability of the 58 is the easier choice.
---
It's a galaxy 10. I think my laptop isn't the best.
---
Yeah I’m pretty limited on playtime also. 50-57 has taken me about a week and a half so far. Guildies said they’d take me into some of the 58-60 dungeons and All I need is UBRS for Ony attunement so I’m hoping that makes those last two levels go by a little faster. BRD was a huge help getting from 53-57
---
You can do ST, but it's an awful place to farm XP in so ideally you want to do it once for the quests, if at all. And the quests are all long chains...
---
So you want to stream snipe?
---
STV and Hillsbrad? Those will have nothing on Plaguelands, BRM, Un'Goro/Silithus and Winterspring!
---
Gee bill!
---
Dual wielding question, how are weapon skills like whirlwind calculating damage(mh only or both)? 
---
And how much does offhand weapon speed matter?
---
Uh, every office in the world?
---
You could talk to the mage and explain the situation (heal power, your BiS, and so on) and ask him to comply. If he agrees write a ticket and to transfer the item.
---
Stereotypes of a Night Elf misunderstood. And it’s all good.
---
And if you don’t know, now you know, naga.
---
I like to think of it as death firing Bolvar. Sylvannas was just middle management running him off.
---
Lots of people were still on dialup at first honestly. I had broadband but still had shit latency often.
---
Some tanks maybe. My guild tanks don't even have full might yet and they're already starting to shed mitigation for threat gear.
---
Ok boomer. Just get good please.
---
??
---
Is this a Filter reference?
---
Nice lionheart!
---
There will probably be a lot of honor trading on PVE servers would be my guess (and lesser extent pvp)
---
Wow this UI is disgusting
---
Ya it's pretty obvious.
---
It’s too late - all the mats related to Phase 2 went 2x/3x their price the day P2 was announced
---
Imagine thinking 5 year olds have any idea of what priorities are.
---
Tanking any dungeon up until lvl 60 is perfectly doable with any spec. I'm a lvl 37 fury warrior and I've tanked everything up until now with no problem. Keep a decent 1h weapon and a shield (for those interrupts) in your inventory and equip them when you join a dungeon group, switch to def stance, and you can tank anything.
---
Not using tank spec also makes leveling much less of a hassle.
---
I expect the price to rise a bit more, especially flask of the titans, then correct, then get another bullish run with phase 3 announcement.
---
Thnaks for all your hints and tips. :)  
---
Hit 60 last night and will now work on gear and Engineering.
---
The image is Amazing. The font tho.. it makes it loose all seriousness
---
Mother fuck I had about ten stacks that I sold last week for like nothing
---
You: "This lvl60 is ganking me over and over and prevents me from leveling up. Fuck him."
---
Also you, after hitting lvl60: "huehue"
---
Well, that is a completely different story.
---
Uldaman (and other dungeons) are designed to accompagny the player though a wide range of levels, clearing wings after wings, but never the entire thing at once. We are clearly guided by the quests that make you go back and forth and they are even named ''back to Uldaman" or "Uldaman, take 3". All of that with a back door that skip the first part of the dungeon.
---
Going for a full Uldaman run is like going to clean the four wings of SM at once. You do not ask for people to be at least 4 level below the Whitename to clear the graveyard. While I understand your point, and nowadays we expect to make a full zerg run and clear the last boss, I believe the dungeons were not always design with that in mind (maybe they actually realized the flow of this and splitted SM in multiple wings for instance).
---
I'm passing on SL. Sylvanas is now a Mary Sue.
---
It's like, why not just have her strole into Stormind and kill Anduin.
---
:\\
---
It happens.  
---
Yeah the mage screwed up.  I can't imagine they were such an intentional asshole to need something they had no plan on actually using.   And even if they were that big a prick to take something that is essentially worthless to them from someone it is bis  thats on them and not you.
---
I ran mara princess 40+ times for a preraid bis ring with a 23% drop rate and never saw it drop, let alone lose a roll on it.  RNG happens.
---
But don't let a single item define you or your character.  You have 17 slots to equip with gear.  Most of those slots will have multiple options.  
---
The key to getting geared is to keep running dungeons.  You might not get what you need on any given run, but you will collect stuff over time.
---
It is not BiS healing trinket. Trinket from DM is BiS. Trinket from Jed is bis and trinket from DMW Magister is also BiS for longer fights - BWL+ (drop chance even worse at around 5% lmao). But all and all it is useless for mage anyways. Get DM trinket + [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10659/shard-of-afrasa](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10659/shard-of-afrasa)  and you are good in MC. Then farm Second wind again or DMW trinket or Jed trinket. Or maybe you will get lucky and win Onyxia trinket. Don´t care too much about Second wind, it is not that good.
---
Relying on tools that should not exist is quite sad in general, massive majority of actual players in classic didnt rely their playing on this shit
---
Nope, you just do much more dps.
---
Yeah, fuck me. At one point some clowns formed a gank squad and corpse camped us at Charred Vale for like half an hour. That corpse run was literally the only thing that made me rage hard in Classic.
---
Three for the druid
---
Now go, cat, go
---
Delete this nephew
---
yea, we do /range 18 in our guild, and it works fine for us. 10 is definitely not enough for the knockback.
---
Time really flies. Something weird happened on my Snapchat app yesterday and it randomly showed me people I didn't have on my friends list but that I had talked to before and I actually went to message one to see how they were doing and the app said I hadn't talked to you them in over 5 years. If I hadn't thought about it I wouldn't even have thought snapchat was a thing 5 years ago. 
---
We're getting so old.
---
Well to start it's fucking annoying that at current content speed naxx be out in August under a year from release to funnel people back to retail for this expansion, so I'm already resentful towards it.
---
spiritual focus or int is also in a 11/9 or 13/7 variant. So you either get the bonus mana or the knockback protection, not both from your variant.
---
Cleanse is not that great. First of all, when you cleanse several times, you've already lost your mana bonus from the int bonus due to that. Cleanse doesn't help against everything. It can't remove hamstring or wingclip, when you get frostbolted, you immediately have 2 debuffs (slow, winter's chill), so your cleanse only has a 50% chance to remove the slow. You might even get a frostbite proc, then you must spend at least 2 cleanses to get rid of it, while freedom removes them all immediately.
---
Assuming you get spam purged or have a certain party makeup is a pointless argument. If you have a holy paladin in your group, they'll spend freedom on a warrior or rogue, not on another paladin and only two classes can do offensive dispels. There is no guarantee those even have the gcds to spend on offensively dispelling you, if they are around in the first place. 
---
And if you spend divine shield, your most powerful cooldown, on removing a slow, then I don't know what to say.
---
It's not "nice situationally", it's an essential part in pvp, especially when you face hunters and mages, freedom is your only tool, giving that up, so you have a little more mana, a small amount of fear resist and heal ~7-8% more is not worth it.
---
The blade is 0,03 according to data
---
Look at all the "I'm so edgy" cringy words being used. Good lord. Can this dude make a sentence without having one in it?
---
I love to hate Gnomes.
---
Blood Elves I only hate.
---
My last level was pretty much just 3 Strath runs and 3 quests for strath, Borelgore and the final quest for the skeleton key.
---
It's not comparable to the tbc prepatch at all.
---
Rank 1-9 you don’t really get anything. Pots, low level armor, pvp trinket etc. 
---
The higher ranks introduce 2 sets of gear. The first set is available through ranks 10-12, 5 piece set that is similar to t1/2 in stats the second set is available at the highest ranks and is basically better than any loot pre-naxx and also features some cool bonus effects and set effects.
---
Damn, I think both of you are spot on. So I don't want to grow up just like in real life. Interesting
---
It's half sad, half amusing how the PvPing/ganking increases exponentially after someone hits lvl60 himself.
---
Probably a warrior after the rogue comment.
---
I thought pvp gear is from rep with the BG quarter masters?
---
Or you can get up there and kill him yourself...? Do you know what happened when some undead mage was ganking on top of the arena in Gadgetzan? I invited 1 other guildie and we killed him, than sat on the arena and kept it clear for Ally to quest. PvP problems require PvP solutions.
---
If this was live this guy would definitely play a Goblin.

---
I gotta ask, what UI setup is that? I have no idea what Addons to use in classic for a crisp UI like that.
---
They didn't have time to make the animations for each race. Of course I just made that up but what if?
---
DarkLegolas666 gets rewards, fame and the ability to look down at everyone with a lower rank!
---
Reward:
---
* rank 1-5 are mostly random stuff including a PvP trinket 
---
* Rewards from rank 6 to 10 is a blue PvP set
---
* Rank 11 a 100% mount
---
* Rank 12-13 is an epic PvP set
---
* Rank 14 is a dozen of epic weapons as strong as the best tier 2 loot
---
You can only buy rewards when you have the rank but can still wear them and keep your title even when you lose rank.

Not necessarily corpse camping but if multiple groups start roaming the area to farm Honor it will be the same as corpse camping. They don't know some guy just blasted you. They kill you, the next grp comes by and kills you and you're basically corpse camped.
---
Thank you!

Or share an account with 4 lads.

WC3 Blink icon is different as seen here http://classic.battle.net/war3/images/nightelf/spells/blink.gif
---
Nah that went out the window a long time ago.
---
I think u/d07RiV summed it up well - it's a pretty dismal and gloomy place in many respects. You're best off looking up the quests for it on wowhead and getting all (or the realistic ones) before going there, for sure. Depending on your role, look up the level of the last boss so you know your level won't hinder your performance in there. You might do Searing Gorge in it's entirety before going there, you'll get a good chunk of XP from doing so.
---
... preferably while being a warrior with top end gear from PvE raids, and a handful of raid-geared personal healers.
---
I have the battle chicken, but it only gives me one more aoe, not sure its better than blackhand's or dm trinket.
---
Lol dueling.
---
Lorewise dwarves arent attuned in the ways of the arcane. Likewise they arent compatiable with the ways of the warlock.
---
Priest and paladinhood suit them though.
---
They dropped again. I'm filling up my warehouzes
---
The problem is that a lvl 50 will probably body pull lots of mobs by mistake and induce wipes. Plus, at level 50, he is probably really undergeared and will oom in an instant unless the rest of the group is overgeared and lvl 60, which is the same as saying he has to be carried.
---
If I remember correctly, the first rank 14 guy on our server back in Vanilla was a warrior who just 1v1 killed guys in EPL, gaining all the honor for himself while everyone else was fighting that gigantic battle in Southshore, getting lots of kills but splitting the honor between all the players, getting reduced honor after killing the same people over and over, etc.
---
Camping flight paths with large groups might end up the same as the Southshore battles of old, but then again, solo killing 58+ people doing their quests might also be more difficult with small PVP groups roaming those areas this time around... Who knows?
---
If I were to farm honor, I would probably build a group of two or three and roam EPL. Avoid big battles where honor is split between too many people, avoid killing the same people over and over who won't give any more honor, but make sure you don't die instantly when there are two enemies at once.

Take an upvote, this is good stuff

I see what you did there!
---
Unless you’re really trying to join a certain streamers guild I would roll on a different server. It’s definitely a busy server, but it’s also a circle jerk of whatever big streamers guild has drama going on that week. I started on Faerlina (and the queue times were pretty brutal at peak times then, not sure about now) and switched to a different still high pop server and enjoyed playing on the second server much more.
---
Isn't that one of the titans? The arcane guy
---
Probably everyone has experienced shit like this at some point. It sucks when it happens but months from now you'll laugh at this because you'll be decked in epics and the shitter who stole your item is still wiping on a 40 man Onyxia pug.
---
Lol nice work detective
---
Quit wow after fist month wotlk, recycling naxxramas was the end for me. How dare you? I spend hundreds of hours in classic there...to finally clear this instance.
---
So after my first wotlk naxxramas run in uninstalled this game crying and end my sub. Never touched this game again.
---
Playing since 2011 classic on private servers, still enjoy it. :)
---
Agreed. I wonder what reason blizzard had for this. If anything, humans would be alot better hunters than the stubby legged dwarves.
---
Thank you for teaching me something new today.
---
Also imagine group of level 47's (gray for 60's) to corpse camp a solo 60, who couldn't defend himself without getting DHK. Groups of low levels are incredibly powerful against a solo high level, people are forgetting it. Ofc if the difference is 30 or 40 levels, the lowbies probably won't be able to do this.
---
The speedrun is like 20 min.
---
It's the first EVER raid boss design. What the fuck did you think, they would perfect it from the start? They had no idea how the game would unfold at this stage.
---
Its not about whatbi can or cant do. Its about policy enforced by blizz
---
They obviously don’t care, either that or it’s impossible to actually “prove”, so they just don’t do it.  But believe me it’s very common on my server at least.
---
Weird, healpots share CD with FAPS and Swiftness so why would someone use all 3? Prefap but heal pot ganks?

thanks for the detailed reply! I'm currently farming up the pieces for Lionheart Helm as well, as a guildy is able to craft it for me when i get the mats. But do you think it would be worth to drop to a 2-piece valor set, get golem helm and valor shoulders, and replace legs with warmasters or eldrich? so the two piece would be bracers/shoulders.
---
Is the evasion neckless you speak of Vereks Collar? (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11755/vereks-collar)
---
I know i need to get those rings and the shield too, I'll get there, eventually :)
---
Also, as an OT, how do you maximize DPS as a prot warrior? Just wondering, I feel like my DPS is garbage most dungeons, but I assume it will be different in raids
---
That's why you travel to MC as a raid... If you really cant clear your way to the MC entrance as a 40 man raid you've got bigger problems

I like the Janice Griffith Gangbang.

Oh wait, wrong subreddit.
---
Damn, i didn't really think of that 🤔
---
With the thicc lips
---
Yeah for sure you're correct.  Just definitely are options if you really really don't want to go there
---
Belfs are honestly pretty jacked, it's just that most wow races look like they're on roids
---
I farmed another 150 whelps and got 21 flame sacs, so everything should be fine. Made around 30 Gold in 2 hours farming, thats very nice for level 40. Thanks for this. :)
---
I work customer service for a software company and we have customers send in screenshots a lot for specific errors. The ways we get those screenshots sometimes are impressive.
---
My favorite is they put a screenshot in an email, printed it out, scanned it into their computer, and sent us that black/white scan of that email thread...
---
Try sunken temple groups, very cool epic sword off last boss and some decent blues for war throughout. Btw your not missing out on raids, mc isnt going anywhere.
---
The server is dominated with streamers. 
---
I wouldn’t recommend the server unless you want to play with a streamer.
---
u sir are an idiot if ur undercutting by 20g
---
Not sure if joke because of crap picture lol.
---
The only thing I’m using is bartender. I’ve just turned off the blizzard artwork and stacked the bars.
---
lol you assume the other faction isn't also there with a 40 man raid, or that there is only 1 40 man raid present of each faction
---
It ain't that black and white bud.
---
What’s a good addon that shows the full map, even before it’s explored, but doesn’t do much else?
---
I installed some levelling guide but it was too intrusive because it did so much and I disabled it, but now I miss being able to see the full map. I just wanna know where towns are without having to check on my phone.
---
You joke but I would probably play that maybe
---
I’m at work/school for 45 hours fromTuesday to Thursday. My time is limited
---
I had 25 days played to 60 in vanilla!
---
This is one of the reasons I actually enjoy tanking. I get to set the pace of the run.
---
No, my question is , if I'm not in the same group as them , but tag the same allies/hordes as they do , if I rank up at the same speed as them . or if there is some drawback to it (like getting less honor when not grouped)
---
&gt;Then dont roll on a PvE server. This is great for us who like ~~pvp~~ *camping flight paths*
---
FTFY
---
"Should not exist"
---
what
---
You aren’t getting to rank 14 without BGs my dude, it’s not a world pvp grind.
---
Flying grind aka world quest mandatory.
---
Yes its possible.
---
I wouldent bother unless attempting speed runs or for some reason having trouble progressing.
---
It's easier for a 40 man raid if you have 2 groups clear the dungeon. Then as you said keep 1 person in the group and cycle 4 people at a time through.
---
I addressed mitigation in my post, but mitigation is not provided to the raid.  It's provided to yourself.  You don't want your tank getting 1 shot because that can't be healed.  In much the same way that someone too low level is inappropriate for the content.  But the ability to survive hits does not make someone a "good tank", it's just the barrier for entry.  Once you've gained entry to the content by being able to survive enough to be healed, your job is to provide threat.  
---
DPS can slow down, but often the need to do so means that they are either a warlock or they outgear the tank.  Smart players do adapt, they do watch threat.  It's what you're supposed to do.  
---
Waiting for 5 sunders is overly long, and the idea of waiting for 5 sunders is that your TPS is so low that you won't be able to hold aggro through the fight.  Instead, by waiting you're building enough of a lead that you can't be caught.  Which is a sign that your TPS is too low for the party.   If you're actually reading, red hamburger.  Going back to the 3 piece partnership, the longer the fight takes the more stress there is on healer mana.  So your TPS being low requires more of your healers and especially so if your TPS cannot keep up with regular DPS and someone pulls through the normal process of killing the boss.  This is why you want higher threat, it smooths out the encounter for all parts of the equation.
---
The most fun part of the raid is getting there.
---
I've basically leveled in dungeons since deadmines.  Rogues seem harder to find than Savage Gladiator Chain.
---
That's what I'm liking about the comments. It's like an insight to other realms economies. I know on mine several people try to up the price on several mats. Such as arcane Crystal's and black lotuses. Avg realm price for a black lotus was 50-60g, they're upping it to 70-90, I understand we don't have layering on my server anymore but I don't think people are willing to buy it for that much.
---
I was lvl 49 when the P2 release date dropped. I figured I could get to 60 in time so I've been pushing. I'm only lvl 54 now, and I don't think I will make it.
---
Thank you for this post. 
---
I'm going to chill, maybe try for 55-57 and just live in BRD/Scholo/strat/DM for the rest of the leveling experience.
---
Not for me.
---
This might work if the rest of the group is overgeared/highlevel to compensate. If you got your usual brd group of appropriate level, just handing them a mana pot at a boss probably won't do the trick or leave you with no wiggle room at all, and small accidents happen all the time. Its not just a few bosses that hurt in brd, lots of packs can pose a challenge in the later parts.
---
Why could this only be done in classic?
---
why not ? seems like that depends alot on when BGs are released
---
I just got to 48 yesterday, sooo
---
LOL.
---
I use slashfour
---
The biggest thing that pushed me away from retails is all the class overdesign and mathematically formulated DPS rotations.
---
Warlock for example.... In Classic I have Immolate, Corruption, Doom, Agony, Shadowbolt...... And it does not matter what spec I am playing, I have all those spells to use.  The difference between Specs is one or two utility spells and propping up an aspect of game play....and that's about it.  
---
Retail?  Its like playing a different class altogether between specs with most spells being spec specific.
---
Grilled squid. I yell out selling grilled squid for 1g each boom rogues, hunters and warriors thinking they're rogues come in droves.
---
Why would it give you XP?
---
Its still layered.  The ques next week are going to make people cry.
---
It's an angle of Antonidas.
---
Anyone else getting bummed at the number of bots? It feels like every zone I run into a few, report them and move on but nothing ever happens and they're still around.
---
Probably because the majority of people who play classic also played vanilla, and they're not kids worrying about homework?  
---
Doesn't make them boomers, my parents are boomers. Majority of people playing wow are millenials.
---
I never played classic when I was young and I'm enjoying it.
---
Somebody pls turn this into a buzzfeed listicle

soft cap as in yellow hits? when u use abilities like heroic strike?
---
because you kill something that's challenging? makes sense to me
---
I remember them saying something about not giving too many classes to any single race. They were trying to balance how many races could have a certain classes.
---
Cool thanks.  Was more curious about it for future content than something we actually needed
---
in classic, ww only uses MH weapon only (was both weapons at some point in retail) and weapon speed is normalized.
---
OH Speed does not matter for ww.
---
Your OH is what gives you rage, which you can dump with your MH attacks.
---
In current classic meta, axe and sword from ony are the best you can get. so basically, dps matters more than speed for OH.
---
I thought it was obvious trinkets are 'ear-rings'.
---
Antonidas
---
Why do people do this? Just press print screen.
---
&gt; You can only buy rewards when you have the rank but **can still wear them** and keep your title even when you lose rank.
---
I've wondered this for a long time
---
It isnt a risk actually, it is just not the most profit. Even the shittiest games actually end up making some profit, it isnt 2003, servers and maintenance is dirt cheap nowadays, after you invest first and create the game, pretty much you dont put any more money to maintain it. With the hunger for a new game and masses with proper computer and internet connection, it is matter of weeks for even shit games to broke even, and rest is profit. 
---
But investers dont want to invest 100 and earn 100 first month and 10 each month. They want to earn 500 each month, so they dont invest in games. 
---
İn 2014, LoL a free game with no p2w made over 1billion dollars. With about 1000 total workers. You make the mat, and that is what investors are after.
---
3 warlocks to summon your raid aswell helps speed up the process and not waste the buff time
---
No? It was an under city raid that killed Sylvanas and the Horde just said "Fuck it" which made it a steamroll
---
It's like the 40s that want to do an uld run.
---
How so?
---
WoW: Auction House Mobile
---
That's cause warriors take all Rogue loot, from leather in dungeons to perditions blade in raids.
---
&gt; We know Blizzard is going to make an effort to bring Classic players back into the expansion cycle 
---
LLOOOOOK! LICH KING! You liked him, too!
---
((It worked for Legion, when we brought back Illidan. This will surely work as well!))
---
Que the next outrage.
---
Cheaper than dynamite on my server, and 1.5s / cast at 60 is negligible especially if you are only using it in emergencies / 4 - 5+ mob pack pulls
---
Naah, mobs are dead faster my way.  I dont need big numbers to stroke my ego.
---
It's not that bad, plenty of groups just run to angerforge and then reset for HoJ
---
If your healer doesn't need to do anything while your tank gets pounded by one or two groups in the lyceum, you got a higher level and/or better equipped thank than usual. First time I did brd (at lvl 54, resto specced), I used about 1/3rd of my mana bar on every pull, and there just isn't enough time to drink up to full all the time. Doesn't help that I'm a shaman, which means all my utility can't be used because totems don't work on the move.
---
What's a good price for a [Chromatic Cloak](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18509/chromatic-cloak)? On my server, the mats go for ~189g. I've seen one listed for north of 300g, but I have no idea if it sold.
---
2004
---
C'Thun emotes :D
---
Is this so hard to understand? Sometimes one pot is better than another depending on the situtation.
---
&gt; ...we were made CHAMPIONS, and it all kinda went shit from there.
---
Totally agree with you. I find it hard to take the world seriously when everyone living in the world is some sort of super-powerful being, killing gods and whatnot.
---
To go from killing a world ending boss, to the next expansion doing meaningless task, for some reputation, and dungeons feels a bit weird when you think about it.
---
When you reach the top it's hard to go higher.
---
I often try to make peace by listing my stuff at the exact same price. Only bid price a little lower so it stil appears first.
---
wrong subreddit
---
But then humans could be all classes :( also not great
---
Unlike in retail classic raids don't become obsolete with the addition of a new raid. Bosses drop 2-4 items and with ony and Mc there are only 9 raid bosses available. Even if you try hard and go raiding with 30 people for more loot that's basically only 1 item on average per player per week assuming perfect loot distribution and only the actually good items dropping. Then there are items like azure song which are just crazy op and basically desired by half the raid. And when a new raid comes out the same applies so there is still demand for most items from the previous raid.
---
It's impossible for a raid to be "done" with a classic raid in only 11 weeks. Getting full epic is already a lot slower than in retail and getting all the BiS from raids is almost impossible without a guild funneling all the loot to a few key characters.
---
unless they're using xfc, then they'll just have the other group kill you first
---
Yes, which is one of the big reasons why world ranking is fucking garbage.
---
What does this have to do with Classic WoW?
---
Free Honor in the next phase.
---
This is ancient history. Get over it already.
---
you are going to want to be able to buff your fishing up to as near 425 as possible, fyi.  you need &gt;300 just to cast, and 425 to ensure a catch.  Also, other fish in Bay of Storms are also good.  pretty good catch rate on squid, mightfish, etc..  Also several rich thorium nodes in/around the bay if you mine.
---
The amount of ads in that article made my eyes bleed.
---
I wish screenshots existed 😂
---
Just make wow2 already. There is just no way I will set foot into retail again, because on the one hand, it just feels the same and I had enough of that, while on the other hand, I would have to learn the little details again which did change since I last played, would check what stuff from expansions I missed might still be relevant, etc. It would feel like watching the last third of a movie that you watched the first third some weeks ago...
---
Classic got me hooked for the world and to some extend mmo's in general again. But I'd need a restart where everyone starts on equal footing again to consider it, and an addon to wow will always give me a feeling that I'm behind the other players, even if technically everything from before this addon is no longer that relevant.
---
wow2 could reset the power level from "save the world every 5 minutes" to "adventurers", could re-invent classes and game mechanics more than they can do in an addon, it could have a shiny new graphic, etc.
---
Since the warcraft story is a bit exhausted by wow, maybe just make World of Starcraft instead?
---
That being said, there is just no incentive for Blizzard to make wow2, as people still pay for wow, and those people will love a new addon where they can keep playing their existing characters.
---
Because the absurd amount of ranking points you *need* are literally unacquirable before bgs.
---
Eh, Scorsese just sounds old and jaded. His argument is "it has all the parts but because they took the effort to make it clean and appeal to a massive group, its just not "My Cinema" as if he owns the definition of the word.
---
You can get R14 without BGs.
---
Good. Stick to your policy. Nothing as dumb as a company folding to fake outrage on social media. They are developing games, not promoting world peace.
---
I bet you enjoyed every minute of it, huh?
---
Like turning Felcloth into Mooncloth! 2g becomes 20g.
---
And my axe!
---
At level 55? I'd have to be closer to (or at) 60 I thought.
---
I’m already corpse running into brd and brs most of the time anyway
---
Wow thank your so much, this was a better answer I could have imagined.
---
Like I said, that pretty much depends on when BGs are released . If Bgs are released 3 months or more after honor comes out , its 100% possible to get to R14 without BGs
---
Can you do partial DM N Tribute runs?  I'd like to keep killing Komcrush and Cho'Rush for their drops but want a shot at the elven ring from Mizzle.  Or do I need to do these in separate runs?
---
Tbc is my most liked wow :)!
---
It's free, what do you have to lose? :) great game, this is the first league I've skipped haha
---
Officers gear up reliable raiders b4 themselves until naxx then they take everything. Works for me anyway.
---
I could individually hide it in settings but I like an empty desktop so I hide them all.
---
It's going to be a shitfest whether you fall in this "Kill Range" or not.  I"m 53.5 right now with no chance at getting to 60.  But even if I did, I'll be terribly geared and still get the shit kicked out of me.  I've already got a full rested bar on a couple alts ready for when things get really bad for what I"m trying to do.
---
My guess is they are going to do like Mara and release WSG early before P3.
---
They can get you killed very very easily. Top pvpers always collude and avoid fighting top pvpers from the opposing faction.
---
The only thing “cringe” about this is OP and his/her insecurities in writing this title. 
---
This guy is awesome. OP is just jealous of the confidence.
---
That sure is a big horse, mister.
---
shouldn't take too long.  Maybe 10 minutes or so?  you can absolutely go around Darkshire as Horde.  You can get around it in the hills on the southwest-west side of town.  As long as you go counter-clockwise (around the north end) in Deadwind Pass, you can avoid any of the aggressive stuff.  And yes, stonard is there.
---
Too meta, too furious.

Precisely

How hard is getting Rank 10 or Rank 11?

What is a warrior even going to do from up there?

your character will hang out in limbo, anxiously waiting for you to resub, like a puppy that doesn't understand you go to work every day and is super happy when you come home.

I don’t think you know what narcissistic means. I’m sure you can afford some adult classes with all that money though.
---
 nice fix
---
It is already confirmed that it will be the upgraded gear. When you can get your hands on it, then for a brief period you will walk like a god among men until AQ gear is out.

I always wondered, why is Redridge the target of choice?  Are people bound to Kargath and its just an easy hop to searing gorge then south?  Redridge always seemed so out of the way lol.

---
True AH masters sell everything at 1g above listing price. You always get a nice quick gold
---
In this case it’s a bear (yay Druid), she will understand. Lol.
---
You can't unless the dps cooperate by focusing and waiting, which they usually won't.
---
The majority of spell damage saving procs people remember were from a bug introduced in the burning crusade prepatch. Only shadow oil, frost oil, and dragon breath chili should scale like that
---
I mean they certainly don't "agree to disagree" with them that's for sure.
---
Please tell why. Doesnt it sell for 20g already?
---
Any update on this server? I have my Warlock here, but am away often so have no idea how it's doing
---
You seem pretty special to me pal
---
This 100%.
---
Just don't expect to tank Onyxia and it works fine even for some bosses in MC.
---
If you are offline for a long period (6+ months) there will be a chance your name will be reset, but characters themselves will never be deleted.
---
The second area with the chest in the middle? Most groups go along the right wall to avoid the patrols. It's faster to sneak through middle but if someone pulls it could be a problem. You can evade mobs by jumping on the railing on the stairs btw.
---
How about doing this by making the dark portal a portal to a new TBC server. So you go through and that migrates your character. That way people can stay in classic and finish their raid tiers.
---
Alright so let me get this straight.  You got out-rolled on a piece of gear that you've been farming by a person who should have probably passed to you, and that made you want to quit the game?   We should all be so lucky if this is our worst experience in classic....
---
Next time you run BRD for that caster trinket with +healing on it, make sure you spend a bit of time talking to the other casters about what their intentions are.  I bet if you'd have mentioned that trinket and how good it is for healing, and how a mage can't really get that much use out of it, he wouldn't have needed on it.  Get over it man.
---
By the way, this is not a unique situation.  Rogues, warriors, and hunters do this to each other all the time.  Everybody that does physical damage needs on rogue gear.  Everyone who can equip a ranged weapon rolls need on hunter BiS crossbows.  Some people contend that HoJ is a great hunter trinket even though we don't (usually) swing our weapons.  Losing rolls to people is part of the game.  People who can't make good use of certain items rolling need and winning is part of the game.
---
I honestly don't notice them on Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Maybe that's b/c it's a RP server, maybe I'm just not paying attention... I dunno.
---
US market Avg hasn’t changed, maybe on your low pop realm they have
---
&gt;Problem is, that playerbase (myself included) is the playbase where most people cant just allocate multiple hours of a single evening to raiding and raiding alone. 
---
Same. I can't dedicate 3-4 hours a night, 3 nights a week to raiding like I did in Vanilla - the start of Cata. I do want to see and complete the raids, but I have no idea how I'll pull it off. I rolled on a West Coast server despite being East Coast because I wanted to avoid streamers, but I need to get to bed by 9pm eastern, 10 at the absolute latest, because I have to get up super early for work. 
---
I want/need a guild in which everyone shows up prepared and knows the strats for the bosses so that 2 hour raids twice a week would still allow for solid progression. I'm not a "go go go!!" person, but I don't have a ton of time so I don't want it wasted.
---
Lmao grats from one of the dumbasses in your strat live group!!
---
Indubitably
---
I got more than half of 58 in one rested strat run it's not that bad
---
For sure. I had absolutely no idea how to level efficiently, not that it was important to me. I fucked around a lot with exploring and pvping.
---
That guy Jt is an absolutely monstrosity of a lad, I wouldnt want to meet him alone in a corn field without my chocolate milk.
---
Mats plus like 20-30g fee usually.
---
Yes but haven't you heard? Mage bad.
---
TBC without automatic dungeonfinder, and without dailies, and without flying mounts? (Some changes to map would be necessary)
---
You say you are missing raids, do you already have a guild or friends to play with? If so, see if they will help you dungeon grind, it's good xp and will get you gear for raiding. It also will leave a bunch of quests to do at 60 since xp rewards get converted to gold at max lvl
---
Are you sure? If that's true then this should work for the OP.

I'm sorry for your loss of sleep :(
---
I had this problem too, but not that severely. Since I've started playing wow, I usually go to sleep after 1:00 am, when I need to wake up at 8. It really isn't enough for me (28 yo).
---
If you can't reduce your sleep schedule from 3am to 12am directly, try at least doing it in intervals of 30min or 1h, it's really bad for your general mood in the long run.
---
Stay sane!
---
The one where you charge your team 25g each for tanking.
---
And Shamans.
---
I've solod princess 10 or so times, only saw that ring drop once.
---
No items are locked. This logiq is flawed. Classic will not hold your hand to the point where you cant roll if you shouldnt use it. You can roll on Hunter specific gear as a mage, it doesnt mean you should do it,or have the "right" to.
---
Yup in the original beta you could totally be a Dwarf mage
---
That is good to know! Just a short break - didn’t realize how addicting this game could be and I have a test coming up. Lol.
---
I can't agree with you. Uldaman is relatively small dangeon. Not even close to BRD for example.  You can complete it in less than an hour. I don't remember single lfg message for half uldaman. SM is way different, you start gy at lvl 28+, lib at 33+, armory is 35+, Cath is 37+. Uldaman is a placeholder for lvls 42(to high for sm) and up to 44 (can run zf already why even go to not that popular dangeon at this point, unless you need some item there).
---
Far as I remember it's like mobs in retail. Have to tag it. Healing doesn't count. But in theory, yes that would work.
---
Let us not resort to our Basal instincts.
---
Reverse read it.
---
Classic BiS = definite list of gear, that is not flexible (kinda like tier gear). "You get it once and you're done."
---
So while he didn't have the set, his MAU/DAU numbers were high. "Active till I get it all."
---
Now that he has it all, he no longers needs to be as active -&gt; MAU/DAU numbers are low.
---
In retail they removed this by adding "flexibility", effectively making you play all the time as you are never really done with it. Which is what people don't like.
---
So it makes total sense from stake-holder's PoV.
---
"Can get it all" = bad
---
"Has to be online all the time as the posibilities are endless" = good
---
[deleted]
---
You lack balls.
---
same with Kurinaxx, allies wont fight
---
Sunder Armor, not Thunder Armor.
---
I've been healing dungeons with pugs for 1.5 months now. That is patently untrue. Garbage gear warriors/healers still hold threat better, and survive plenty fine, than deep prot tanks.
---
Healers get stressed when aggro gets leashed on them. It is fairly rare that tanks are squishy enough that it's an issue. Holding aggro is the issue 9 times out of 10.
---
Not about hating people. I'm Very nice and sympathetic person.  The PVP aspect makes the game feel more real and alive, in my opinion.  The opposite faction are Stone Cold enemies in the game and a threat of being attacked by one when you see one is pretty neat.  I've had plenty of Encounters of just waving to Alli players and they wave back and we carry on. It's not a complete shit show on PvP servers. 
---
I will agree though, sometimes it is fun and funny to me to gank some unsuspecting players.   Having the option to do that is appealing to many. PvP and the threat of it is great
---
In b4 butt bitten. Lol
---
But seriously, I have high hopes for it as well, the only thing that's keeping me away from retail right now is the rush mentality, I mean classic has it too, for the high end people, but in retail you have to be in that mentality or you will not experience content. In classic, I can take my time and still experience content without falling behind.
---
Is the threat drop confirmed? After the knockback. I cant find any info on this anywhere.
---
You can’t solo angerforge what....?
---
But when a mage beats any class besides a warrior or rogue then they are the superior player hands down
---
I would give a kidney for that. Lost rolls on both of them several times already.
---
Lol! Sorry for that attempt, not sure if that hunter was trolling or made a beefy (!) mistake!
---
Camp blackrock mountain entrance with a handful of people. Stealth classes or night elves are best. Warlock is also good for having succubus sit in the middle of the path invisible to setup kills.
---
It is dumb and unoriginal, so why so defensive? It's still just a stupid joke so no reason to whine about it.

Were they caught in between powershifting or were they caught in kitty form? We haven't had our melee group blown to bits with our feral among them in either of our last two runs, but I'd still rather not continue testing our luck if you've got this confirmed.
---
Ive stopped playing this game for years at a time and never lost anything. You will be fine and come back to your account being the exact way you left it.
---
I mean, Onyxia is immune to taunts anyway, so that's one of the few raids where a Paladin tank has a snowball's chance...
---
Live Strat for Orbs is always profitable, being a tank you might be able to reserve one.  DM Jump runs with a healer and  a DPS can be profitable if you are quick.  
---
I know a lot of people here are going to dislike this, but... depending on your server, you can sell your tanking services.  Assuming you are a 'good tank', you can probably get someone to pay you 5-10g per player for a quick run.  Half up front, half before the last boss.  If this is something you are thinking about, please be a good tank and if you do mess up, refund or don't take the last half of payment.
---
&gt;I kinda tired of seeing the same meme every day.
---
The rest of classic community: So anyways I started posting.
---
Still believe PVE servers have the better endgame perspective. Faction imbalance is horrid on every PVP eventually and when Naxx is out PvP becomes a binary thing where you either have Naxx gear or start running. Players raided Karazhan with Naxx gear. Its an complete itemization reset.
---
No flying mount. No layers. There's not 20 different capital citys from 15 years of expansions. There is a server community because we don't later cross realm.
---
Do you happen to have a fightclub P6 build?
---
Curious as to which, if any, P1-2 pieces carry to endgame.  Gotta budget my DKP properly and would love to see what my character aspires to look like.
---
GMs do not do this anymore. I  believe they are so understaffed they do not have the time nor the resources to accomplish this like they did in original vanilla WoW.
---
When they sunset that PvP system I think they gave everyone a title with the highest rank they achieved.
---
But everyone on Reddit said not to worry about being mid 50s in phase 2 because the smartest thing to do is level while farming your preBiS in those dungeons, so what's the deal?
---
I remember when I first did WC in classic. The first run had no CC and a lot of wipes. The second run my mage friend was high enough level to join and it was extremly easy because no matter how bad the situation was I could count on mobs being CCed.
---
he's definitely trolling and you guys are getting triggered with every post so it's working
---
I don't like the idea of macroing abilities to change stance if necessary, I want complete control.
---
So I moved WASD to ESDF, which allowed my to put the stances onto QAZ. Then I have 1h+shield and other weapons bound to RGH. And abilities on 1-6, ZXC, shift1-shift6 etc.
---
Mainhand damage range (what it says on the weapon), plus something like `speed*ap/14`, where ap is your attack power, and speed is the "default" speed for your weapon type (used to be actual weapon speed but it got nerfed because it made slow weapons too good).
---
It was legendary!
---
Druid tank and healer LF 2-3 Rogues or 2 rogues and BOOMkin for stealth runs.
---
You will struggle, especially on low level.
---
While leveling you can do two things to counteract this a little:
---
1) Bind 1-2 raid targets to hotkeys, e.g. Skull to F1 and use that for the target that you focus your SA spam on and tell your dps to focus on that, too. If they don't do that, let them die. Just make sure you actually never lose the aggro of skull and prevent adds hitting your healer ever.
---
2) Keep your tank weapon up-to-date and make sure it is a really fast weapon. Caster daggers and other stupidly looking things are completely fine for this purpose and easier to come by. If your weaponskill is slacking behind, make sure to kill a few mobs outside the dungeon while traveling there.
---
Hello, macro question! I tried to make a macro to swap weapons. It always swaps to the second weapon but never back to the first. I just used /equip *weapon name*.
---
have you looked at the tooltip?
---
300 mana on use every 15 minutes, and it boosts healing spells.  It does nothing for a mage.
---
Good to know on the combo.
---
My pally main has mining and engineering so I'll just send engineered items to my shaman at some point when/if I want to PvP
---
This reads like Donald Trimps twitter...
---
This made me punch my monitor
---
Cant wait for phase 2 to get back at all the warriors wearing leather with no hp from dungeons lol.
---
Gnomes should not be warriors! They're a disgrace to the class!
---
Scholo at 59 is not a problem.
---
BRD Emperor at 53 or UBRS full run at 55 are larger problems. Also if I want to do Jed/Rend runs I'd want to run with as few as possible. Since Rend himself is 62 and the biggest obstacle when shortmanning, I wouldn't bring anyone under 60. When I say shortmanning, I say 4man.
---
Also, a lot of dungeons being low level is adding too much pull range.
---
thats what I was thinking
---
At least it's not a nipple
---
My undead rogue has jumper cables hanging from one ear and nothing on the other.
---
While HS is queued your OH can't miss. You can activate and cancel HS to generate additional rage. It is very difficult but is easier/harder depending on your weapon speed.
---
When you need attention and hitting 60 is not trending anymore.

Is there a discord where I can get more help with Weak Auras for Priests?
---
Saaaaaame
---
Your comment should be the subtitle of this sub. It captures 80% of the people on here.
---
While I like the cartoonish style of WoW and it's what drew to to it and kept me with it, this really shows the true, chilling horror of what Naxxramas really is.
---
Layers just split the population up so locations arent too player dense, they operate independently from total realm population caps (which determines queue)
---
10 hearthstones 🤮
---
I know in D&amp;D(which the classes are kind of based on) dwarves can't be spellcasters in older editions. I think they can in later editions but their racials sucks for it.
---
People hate on the new cinematic because they are stupid and haven't followed the lore. It makes perfect sense for Sylvanas to own Bolvar. The people who whine about it are the ones who think Bolvar = Arthas
---
Probably not the best choice of words there. I wouldn't call underleveled people lazy, since we're the ones that aren't able to level as fast since we have to work actual jobs, we don't get to sit in front of our PCs 12hrs a day every single day. Laziness is not the issue here. 
---
The basement dwelling no lifes that are trying to speed run through Classic are the ones ruining it for everyone else. Phase 2 is going to be just the beginning of the fallout for this bullshit that is being enabled by blizz releasing DM early and now phase 2. You all act like 2 weeks early isn't a big deal, but when the majority of players are in their late 40s to early 50s those 2 weeks are critical. This push to appease all the tryhard no lifes is going to end up snowballing. 
---
Vanilla didn't begin and end in 9 months, the best thing about it was the absence of feeling like you're rushed to do things. It's really sad seeing what's happening now.
---
So if my main goal is rank 10, decay exists at every rank? Not just 10+?
---
It's easy. And you know what, I am glad it's easy and boring. They just get to quest on autopilot leveling fast as hell. Warriors, shamans, rogues, priests etc. out here get what they put into it. Fun endgame shit. 
---
Mage or hunter is a snooooooooze fest after leveling to 60. Mages are just a hair more fun than a hunter, whenever I see someone with a hunter class I just think, "why are you spending your time on this trash? You'll either be middling dps charts, or be mediocre in BGs"
---
At least mages can polymorph, make water for healers (which doesn't really add to the 'fun' point, but still helpful), and aoe. To me, that's their greatest value.
---
Polymorph in a dungeon + healer being able to drink as much water as they can makes for an easier run.
---
Aye you can, but you could also take one of the 20,000 level 60 dps who want to do strat/scholo. Why gimp your group?
---
You can totaly tank dungeon in arms spec, and you will be totally fine if you have a plate tanking stuff. With arms spec, you can charge in with a 2h-bloodrage-SS-Berserker rage-WW and do a tons of aoe dmg as an opener then switch to 1h+shield and you will never loose aggro on packs
---
Haven't seen any
---
Yeah we were pulling at least 8-12 mobs a pull generally I was fine holding aggro with like 3-4 but anymore is oof
---
You just contradicted yourself. 
---
Add-ons existed in vanilla and do now.
---
Twas ever thus.
---
Theres not a fixed ammount of points, its based on your faction points.
---
That's not actually how economics works.
---
Got one last week now the hundreds of kills to never see the second.
---
“Loot the damn core hounds” needs to be an addon
---
So you need to consider opportunity costs and substract the 10g comission from arcanite. Or 5g since it is twice the cooldown.
---
you can certainly tank all of the 5 mans as arms. prot is more like for if you are the main tank for a raid guild.
---
Impossible he’s clearly wearing shoes.
---
It's not about the screen, it's about sending a message.
---
You can tank dungeons as arms, even without shield, though some healers will hate you for that especially if you don't have great gear. 2H will do better threat but be ready to turtle up if things start hurting.
---
Did anyone AOE grind as a mage to level? If so, was it all you did from level 20 onwards? I'm confused if I should quest as well while doing it etc.
---
It’s great. Can kill off low health enemies in pvp also.
---
Worst part is that the Boomer is clicking the buttons!
---
50 000 rank 12 55 000 rank 13 60 000 rank 14 but ok
---
Druid!
---
As a rogue interrupting and distracting gives me a chubby. Sap may only work out of combat but blind in a pinch is nice and did a lot of dungeons with a priest friend who was always below the recommended level for the dungeons we were doing. If we cc and interrupt he was healing our dungeons when the enemies were red to him.
---
Reddit's a small microcosm full of weirdos with a very skewed sense of reality.  I have 2 60's, one full t1 the other full preraid bis.  I've done countless dungeons.  Every single group I've been in is 100% on board with all needing BoEs because its logical.  There is very little toxicity and I have made plenty of friends to hang out in discord with.  It is the exact opposite of cancer.
---
That right horn with the baton on it looks ridiculous!
---
Isn't it coming with phase 5 dungeon loot update?
---
Also less thing. There may be a few unsuspecting players on a PVP realm but the vast majority knew what they were signing up for.  Yeah I can be annoying when you get ganked to when you really don't want to but everyone knows it's fair game yep
---
This might blow your mind, but ALL of Nesingwary's hunters are hunters.
---
I always wondered why the Icon was a Beluga Whale....
---
...its cuz its not. LOL
---
Just play an alt for a while, then go back when you feel like it.
---
At least that is what i do. (58 now...)
---
This guy eats dog
---
Man I've run this shit like 20 times and haven't even seen Jed spawn lol
---
And I know whenever I finally roll on it, if I'm not in a guild run, I'm gonna get shit for it because I'm a shadow priest but that shit is BiS for me too
---
If they resist 2-3 stuns, they don't. But you can blind right out of a resisted stun, if you anticipate it.
---
129 upvotes, why is this even allowed here.
---
Just sunder armor the shit out of the mobs and you'll be fine. Also, stack spirit - &gt; str -&gt; agi up to lvl 40 and then go with agi -&gt; str -&gt; stam from 40-60 and make sure you're using a proper 2hander for your lvl and it'll be a super smooth grind to 60. And yes you can tank dungoens up to 58 easily as arms spec.
---
Thanks I’ll look at this again later and try it out. My healer buddy says I do a good job relative to other tanks but I know I have room for improvement. I’m plabnning on switching to prot once I get closer to 60 but I’ve been doing a mix of fury and arms while leveling. That talent in prot that generates more rage looks great though. Either way I’ll try hitting berserker rage more often early in my rotation. I’m also ashamed to admit that I realized the other day that I’ve been reading the revenge ability wrong for 49 levels lol .... I thought it was when the target parried, blocked or dodged. Jc don’t know how I missed that. Thanks again.
---
negative.
---
 the -crit is included in the block/dodge/parry/miss.
---
What's the point of a build that only works well in a group that's running perfectly? Why not have a shaman tank? They work fine in groups with perfect target priority too.
---
You don't need the damage mitigation of deep prot for any 5 man PvE content in game right now. Not even slightly. DPS warriors with tank gear are plenty fine, and honestly better when they need to be.
---
I have a 60 mage and I didn't aoe grind even once. Usually all the good spots are taken so it ends up being a waste of time cause you're fighting over mobs.
---
Guilds not focused on hardcore progression should not be doing loot council. 
---
If you are in a guild doing loot council that is not focused on hardcore progression, you are most likely just feeding gear to guild leaders, officers and their friends. 
---
If you have to ask a question about how to do loot council, you probably shouldn’t be doing it. 
---
The only reason it makes sense is to guarantee gear to those who need it for insuring progression, ie giving the main tank gear to make them tangier and content easier. 
---
The content is already incredibly easy, and if you’re failing in molten core - the problem is not one piece of gear that the main tank did or didn’t get.
---
I don't find the XP gain to be that low in sunken temple, i did like 3-4 level in there as a healing priest. And i was getting around 1/3 of a lvl by run, while doing run in about 1h10 and 1h30.
---
The things that might make it not that efficient for most class is the time you need to find a group, wich is probably harder now that a lot of people are max lvl.
---
One of the few times I wish I could upvote more than once
---
120g in week 3 was a lot of gold.
---
For PVE content, r13 armor is generally on a par with T1 and r14 weapons are on a par with Naxx. The r10 armor isn't as good as BiS for raiding BUT they come with PVP orientated stats and bonuses which make them worthwhile if you're a PVPer. If you're a PVE orientated player, stick to PVE gear.
---
Oh they work...
---
It's just a long cool down depending on the career level of the individual. Some people never leave the noob zone, still slinging retail package for exp and rewards after years of play time.
---
Ony buff would definitely help tho
---
Went to get my forged seal of ascension for the UBRS ring the other day. while waiting for my friends to show up a couple of horde triode the dragon and forged theirs and I guess while they weren’t paying attention I walked over and yoinked it from them.
---
Just look at your [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher/steam and check all the games. Just launch the one that feels right for this moment and the most fun. I played some friggn Hearthstone and CoD last night. I got owned in both games, but it was fun. Then I emptied the dishwasher and cleaned up the kitchen a little. Whole process took me less than two hours. I firmly believe that these two hours made me more focussed while playing last night and achieve more than adding two more hours to my chars playtime.
---
And they do this to allow more people on at a single time. That's why they're removing layers as player population drops. 
---
Layers were copies of the entire world, they weren't like sharding in Retail.
---
If zones got too crowded, a layer would open. This did not simply split the existing players up (because then you'd have two worlds at only 50% capacity), it allowed more on at a single time.
---
Instead of having multiple copies of the world each with their own maximum capacity, you have 1 copy of the world with a maximum capacity.
---
Or are you seriously trying to claim that servers with 2 layers have 2 half full worlds, servers with 3 layers have only a third full worlds, servers with 4 layers have only a quarter full worlds?
---
What even would be the point of layers then?
---
Rank 10 isn't terribly hard, Rank 11 is where it starts getting really competitive.
---
4 day cd. Under 5g a day

---
Don't care at all you couldn't pay me to play that retail trash and the only reason i'm playing wow is for classic.
---
I feel like they are going to rush classic so they can try and funnel classic player in to the new xpack and its pissing me off.
---
I’m sitting here on my huntard wondering the same thing... should I be all mail? Who knows I’m dead immediately anyways
---
That's good to hear. On the same subject are people usually strict as in what type of warriors they bring in for dps? I know fury is better for pve dps so should I be respecting to fury if I ever want to dps as a warrior in a pve setting?
---
Don’t charge into every group, mark a skull and a cc I’d you need it. Try to be on the high end for lvl in a dungeon I’d you aren’t confident. Don’t be afraid to stance dance for overpower. Using a 2hander in dungeons up to SM is good for threat. Buy good BoEs some stuff like dresmsinger legs and tithes bracers will last you into SM or til you get plate
---
I gank lowbies... lvl 2 23 45 60 dont care beware
---
It would be glorious. While I stand by enjoying the expansions more often than not, I would love classic to take us to WotLK and then diverge with new content and a new storyline as that was the point of no return as far as classic content went in my opinion.
---
Saw a same faction guy fishing in azhara while i looked for elemental pools. On my second circle I saw the pool where he was fishing and I waved politely and moved along.
---
What's been on my mind later was that he never moved from the spot, he just fished non stop at the same spot for the whole duration I was there. Did I just give up a pool to a fishing bot?
---
Off with ye!
---
not gonna lie I get bitter some times when I get camped by a lvl 60. I am gray to you, comon.. (not you specifically of course) I just don't get the thought behind camping a gray level.
---
I needed a flask recipe an hour or so before I got to 300 alch.
---
I remember playing a few hours every night of just battlegrounds for weeks when in high school to get to rank 11. So something like that.  
---
It was fucking legit having an epic black war raptor for free on my orc though.
---
AH HA!
---
“Off with ye” intensifies
---
Cludens warrior weak aura 2.0 is pretty nice
---
Killing guards doesn’t give you a DK yet
---
You don't. Mages can go easy on you and open up with blizzard, but even then it's hard
---
Is this true even if the rogue gets the jump on the warlock?
---
And those are not live. He said classic, not vanilla.
---
Sounds like a pve server is right for you then
---
Then you checked in the wrong place because it’s a full day.
---
Can you distract low health mobs trying to flee into other packs?
---
Wotlk has dailies and split difficulties and death knights and a rehashed raid and lfd/lfr. It was the start of the end.
---
I wonder how many groups are actually formed there. I suppose it depends on your server, but on Fairbanks/A, I've never had any trouble using LookingForGroup (although I'll also hit up Trade if I'm in a city). I figure the number of people in "lfg" but not LookingForGroup who are actually looking for a group is probably pretty slim.
---
When I started tanking I let the group know that I was new to the role, and that I might not be as fast as they were used to. Ask if someone knows the fights and the best paths to take while clearing the dungeon. Tanks are in such low demand for 5 mans that most people are extremely happy to even find one! It's better to have a new tank than none at all!
---
Most people will understand and keep your pace, and apologize if they over-agro or pull additional mobs etc. The ones who don't are people you don't want to play with anyways. Gather up some names of chill players and keep them on your friends list!
---
Some general advice is to never spec protection. It is not worth it for any 5 man. Go arms while leveling, and spec fury in the early 50's when you have access to Thrash Blade. Fury tanking generates a lot of threat, and should make the job easier. 
---
Tactical Mastery in the Arms tree is your best friend; especially when tanking 2-3 mobs. This makes it possible to switch to battle stance and hit a mocking blow on a loose target. You can then taunt it after the mocking blow duration ends for 16 seconds of 100% threat without even hitting the target with cleaves/sunders. Don't spec fury until you have enough talent points to put at least two points into Tactical Mastery.
---
Another advice that helped me a lot is to level Engineering to 175, so you can use Solid Dynamites. They are relatively cheap to make and deals up to 290 damage in a large AoE, perfect for maintaining threat on large groups together with Demo Shout spam. Also keep in mind that you will never be able to hold threat off a mage or a warlock in full aoe. Assist them once they get agro with Challenging shouts or Piercing Howls.
---
Happy Tanking!
---
The 60 does not do the job twice as well. The difference between a 59 and a fresh 60 is minimal. A 59 in BiS will actually do better than a 60 in greens. Yes, raid geared 60s are a different discussion.
---
Said group spent the next 2 hours LF tank, so it clearly wasn't easy to find a replacement.
---
could be a ninja with tabi boots
---
That's an all-natural sunrise baby
---
Sweet. I’m a dev. I’ll pull down the classic branch and get cracking on it.
---
I always thought it was the back of a cloak and hood. Hmm.
---
IIRC healing done will have the same impact as damage done. 
---
So if you’re healing a warlock who’s blasting a disgusting mage to pieces you’ll get rewarded with an honorable (if you’re having an impact on the fight, healing after the mage is dead won’t grant you anything)
---
I have just gone into this with only my memories, and I have to say, im having a great time. There are things I remember that make the journey easier or things I remember...wrong...that end up making it way harder than it has to be. It's a fun time if you aren't relying on the internet, but rather word of mouth in game amongst other players. My fun with this game is not about getting to 60 asap w/ guide but rather to just play it casually. Not worried too much about whether or not I hit 60 before ZG drops. Who cares, as long as I'm not &gt;!horde!&lt;
---
howd you turn off your entire UI except this? or is it just pasted on top of a screencap
---
&gt; Naxxramas, the Scourge, Kel’Thuzad, the Lich King, Arthas, Northrend, etc. all of those plots you can find throughout the leveling experience starting from pretty much level 1 through books you can find laying around.
---
Not just books, half the Forsaken starting zone quests are all about taking revenge on Arthas and beating back the Scourge.
---
I'm not saying it isn't, but what about your link confirms that that's who it is?
---
He probably just cheetah away. meep meep.
---
Feels real bad!  Sorry buddy!!
---
Aw, I was hoping it was meta just to be meta, lol.
---
I'm a freaking Warlock, not a surgeon: fuck gorilla sinews!  Not technically a question so how are you today?
---
I ganked a level 26 undead mage in Ashenvale yesterday...... I'm level 56 and I was just hanging around Ashenvale to help a friend out with some quests. I kind of just wanted to be on the other side after being ganked all the time leveling up but man, I've had guilt over it since last night LOL. I almost tried to find the mage again and do a /sorry at her but I let it go.
---
I'm too soft for PvP.
---
You let all your dps warriors go ball to the wall and only have casters dps in p2. If all your warriors are doing damage one of them is guarenteed to get aggro.
---
Very cool :D 
---
I have been searching for a armory for classic for a while. Is there any plans to make it so that I can scan others too ? Or can I just upload my own character
---
Nice site :)

All I see is baguette baguette

Hello! We are Blood Inc.
---
We are an Alliance guild first established in 2005 and are now operating on Mirage Raceway (EU PvE).
---
We have settled nicely into our new home and are clearing all current content. We desire to finish filling our ranks with active and dedicated raiders that have aspirations to see through all phases.  Our vision is to have a tight knit group that raid together with little to no rotation of personnel.
---
We are made up of experienced players that have played Vanilla in the past but are open to everyone as long as you have a mature attitude, a desire to have fun and able to get on with your guild mates. Ideally you would be online most evenings and have a desire to raid 2-3 times a week. 
---
The Schedule:
---
Molten Core : Wed 2100 - 0000
---
Onyxia : Days determined by resets 2100 - Finish
---
Will we distribute loot using a need or greed roll system with the aid of class priority lists.
---
We are currently looking for:
---
2 each of:
---
Holy Paladins
---
Resto Druids
---
Rogues
---
Ultimately Blood Inc is all about the fun, the ride and the respect for our fellow gamers. If this is something that resonates with you then please consider membership with us.
---
If you're interested, you can come to our Discord and say "Hello" or alternatively you can message Togashi, Zeena, Calandor or Beanstalk in game.
---
See you in server!
---

Wowhead has a [list of some of the most popular leveling weapons](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-best-paladin-weapons).
---
In general though, if you are leveling in Ret and using Seal of Command then ideally you want any two-hander with 3.50 or slower weapon speed. If you wind up with a weapon faster than that (3.40 speed or less) then use Seal of Righteousness instead. At higher levels if you are tanking and running mostly Seal of Wisdom  or Seal of Light, then the fastest one-hander you can get will give more sustain procs.
---
I enjoy drowning people with mind control. Or mind control people into larger packs of mobs.
---
You know, basic priest stuff
---
Depends on what class you are but for the most part the old set is equivalent to dungeon gear but weighted more towards pvp stats like heavy stamina making it useless to anyone outside of new 60's who don't raid or farm pre-bis. The new set is more equivalent to tier 1 gear and the set bonuses even make them bis for a while. But again it depends entirely on the class. It's huge most every dps class will use 2 pieces in pve until phase 3 sometimes until AQ.
---
When players want to price fix without even having a monopoly LMAO. AH really brings out the best in some of these players.
---
Should make one but with races as well
---
It's not a trigger or anger. It's more like pity or wondering why, because what he's doing is spamming a similar nonsense post every day. That's not really a trolling, that's just spam. Line between a troll and someone stupid is very thin. And in a lot of cases stupid people think they are trolling, while they are just being stupid :D    
---
I believe most people just smile when they see his new post and wonder what fictive story did he post this time :D He's like a local clown.
---
its comic sans, most likely
---
He probably wouldn't have to work such long hours if he stopped messing around on his phone all day so he could actually get some work done.
---
Either way the community breaks. Not saying which strategy is better just that it'll be divisive either way.
---
I feel like humans shouldn’t be warlocks though.. but then there’s only be 1 warlock race on alliance
---
Step 1.) be a geared tank
---
Step 2.) Reserve all orbs (or 1-2 depending on market that day) 
---
Step 3.) Profit
---
Exactly that :)
---
I was fishing today in Azshara, far out to sea (on the bit of ruin which sticks out of the water) and a Paladin joined me. We emoted a few times and everything was cool. After about half an hour he went AFK and I decided to try fishing elsewhere. Thinking I was doing him a favour I used my mind control cap on him to buff him with GotW, waved, then jumped into the water. Sadly the mind control was still active and it pulled him into the water behind me. I tried to get him out but failed.
---

Yes, we're going to expand the addon with this function, as soon as possible!
---
[+21 is bis](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11766/flameweave-cuffs). Best way to farm them is from incendius, which is super easy as a warlock.
---
Not everyone has luck with all their prebis items and we have a good idea who put effort into trying to get them and who didn't. The low effort raiders get less consideration for the highly coveted items. If it's a armor piece it may go to the person with worse gear providing they are consistently attending since a lot of t1 is worse than dungeon blues anyway.
---
It’s amazing how long one joke can survive and people still think it’s funny.
---
There's no point where you particularly need fire res in a raid that has MC on farm. Fire prot potions are plenty.
---
Salamander pants though are pretty sexy. For the non-raid equivalent padres is unreasonably good.
---
Only real issues are the mana. - A warrior just needs to be healed after the fight and can press on. A paladin...they need to drink. :P
---
And defense. As a paladin you technically don't much of it, so that Redoubt can trigger as much as possible. - IMO, that's the only real bonus to using a Paladin tank; \~60% block chance (no gear), with 30% of that being on a 10sec CD. This makes for pretty steady 'damage taken'. In addition to the superior aoe-Threat generation if they take Conc.
---
((Really would like to know what the Devs were thinking with that talent. A tank getting critted is a disaster waiting to happen. So why design not one, but two talents that require the paladin to take criticals???))
---
&gt; i'll ban you from world chat
---
Who the hell uses world chat?
---
Because if a BG was released at the same time, world pvp would be dead..
---
Use your Eye to agro the entire floor of dogs, get them to pat around the edge of the court, then evade them.  As they run back tag boss before they finish resetting.  You need to clear one mob this way.  Good share
---
It did on my server (Grobbulus). When layering was removed we had a 30 minutes queue immediately that night when before that we hadn't had one in almost a month. 
---
I'm sure the remaining servers will probably get slightly higher queues when layering is removed.
---
"filled :("
---
Gotta do this as alliance in org and get thralls buff and have him MC you to safety
---
bro, use raid frames in party (found in interface options). That way you can reattached it and place it right next to your bar.
---
The line you walk is incredibly thin. Only you know what's in your heart, but if your issues with immigration are only as described, then you're obviously not racist. The problem for me is that I seldom encounter this set of views without a healthy serving of pure, baseless xenophobia on the side.
---
Some necklaces also shows (try Grand Marshall Morris neck with no chestpiece/shirt/tabard).
---
Theres probably other examples, like some rings.
---
Well if you want to enjoy the game... Rush your alts to 60 cuz you will not have fun. I promise you that.
---
It’s mostly threat based gear and death bone. You don’t really get very good +def items there. It also has Mirahs song.
---
Un'goro, Felwood, Winterspring, Azshara, WPL, EPL, Burning Steppes, and Searing Gorge.  Should be plenty there. You might as well start spending time in dungeons to start working on pre-raid BIS, too... especially at 58.
---
In theory yes ; but in practice you won’t be able to tag even 1/4 of the enemies they are without a big group and healers
---
Nerds
---
Be leery of that... they could only a few totem and it can be some lame ass shit, like we all get one permanent totem of each element (which is basically what Totem Mastery does now, with a small range).
---
Utter nonsense! They're too top heavy! Clearly they would keep falling over. And how are they supposed to survive long, cold nights in the wilderness without a luxurious beard to wrap themselves in?!
---
I'm not condoning it, but let's face it, it's going to happen.
---
If guilds are colluding on small shit like devilsaur, which just gives you gold in the long run, they're definitely going to collude on honor, which gives you exclusive gear (only a % can be at each rank threshold.)
---
This reminds me to start recording my raid comms, thank you.

How can u be that lazy to not Type 2 letters

How dare he stand by the terms of service the player agreed upon.
---
I only really use it to sort by stack size. I hated going through pages of a single piece of cloth in order to find an actual stack of 20.
---
It's an horrendous waste of time for such a small upgrade. It might be easy, but it can take you hundreds of runs to see it drop. You're better off just buying the +shadow wrist from the AH and spend your time grinding other items.
---
I was lucky and got them on my 2nd kill!
---
I did it this way though: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7qwUpL\_1No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7qwUpL_1No)  
---
Not killing Hyenas, killing 2 bugpacks with aoe and then the guard. Fast and smooth.
---
I don't have any sources it just seems clear to me. Look at the blink icons rounded head and look at antonidas classic purple chapeau. Look at blink icons "dwarven beard" and look at Antonidas mighty white beard. It just seems clear to me this was the intention seeing as it was a mage ability referring to an archmage.
---
I knew I wasn't right, but I always thought of the Pillars of Creation or some other celestial body when I saw it.
---
First day of launch. Me (warrior) and a mage, rogue and other warrior are grouped up speed running these quest in brill. While killing murlocks a green 2h sword of the bear drops. Me and other warrior need role on that shit because it would be a huge upgrade to us. Rogue also need roles it and wins it. First person to ever go on my ignore list and I’m still salty about it.
---
It's surely nice playing on PVE server.
---
I haven't seen any.  Report them every time you see them.

I always thought that jump in WC is where boys become men.

Rep rewards from AV and are totally independent from honor rankings (they are just like any other rep rewards, but rep is gained by fighting in AV)

I disagree...have you seen a gnome warrior in tier 2?
---
The wow app works for missions but the AH portion was removed. They no longer support the AH function and won't allow others to create apps for it.
---
The only rogue in our small guild is a 32 alt.
---
Then again we only invite people after they've run a dungeon or two with us and demonstrated they are decent human beings.
---
God damn addicts just can't let it go. It's just disgusting. Need something more respectable in their life, like windfury.
---
Just attach the required stance to every ability that is stance specific. So ie when you shield block 
---
/Cast defensive stance
---
/Cast shield block 
---
/Cast Battle stance
---
/Cast Thunder clap 
---
You'll ever need to worry about stances again just press the bind and you'll swap to the stance (stance changes don't start a global cool down) and use the given ability immediately. It's "stance less tanking" you'll never need to change your 1st bar and always be ready. Using this does require tactical mastery OR a quick activation of blood rage / rage pot at the right times if you don't have tac mastery. Cheers and good luck!
---
&gt; I think it has to do with in Vanilla each class was limited to 6 classes max
---
they werent really though, that's a totally arbitrary limit that could have been changed
---
Same game from 2005 as well
---
pretty sure this was added in later...as an excuse to add them to the dwarfs as the dark iron dwarfs went back to ironforge when moira joined the Council of Three Hammers.
---
Projecting.
---
I still can't figure out what the Lethality icon is.
---
DKP is great if you enjoy having people hoard points for big ticket items and subsequently slow the overall gear progression of the guild.
---
If he is a non-Druid who picked Mark of Tyranny over Blackhand's Breadth, it's not such a big deal because there are other decent DPS trinkets. 
---
But, interestingly, if he's a Druid who ever wants to be a well-geared tank, and he took Blackhand's Breadth over Mark of Tyranny, then he should reroll. Mark of Tyranny is essential and unreplaceable for that.
---
I know it sounds weird, but it's true. You have to have Mark of Tyranny to be a good Druid tank.
---
Emberstrife, ugh...
---
So I'm working on my Ony attunement, and roll over to Emberstrife's cave to talk to him for LITERALLY THE LAST TIME. He's dead, and there's a couple other people in dragon suits waiting, and a few more trickle in while we're all chilling.  Then a 5man group comes up, sans dragon suits, and starts making like they're gonna kill him again.  We plead with them to let us turn in, but our cries fall on deaf ears and they immediately pull and tag him.  6+ of us left to wait another 15m because they couldn't wait 30 seconds for us to turn in quests.
---
Cue a week later, I'm working on my UBRS key finally, and what step do I get to but having to MC Emberstrife and have him breath on the key. Working on the quest with my guildies, we get over to Emberstrife where yet again there are a few people waiting for the spawn to turn in quests.  Like slow motion, everything plays out again only now I'm in the group of dickheads that immediately tags and pulls the dragon, leaving everyone else in the lurch.  My guildmate got his key made, but we realized the breath attack has a CD of several hours so we'd be forced to kill &amp; reset him to even get another key.
---
I left in shame shortly after.  Still haven't gotten my UBRS key made...

Thats the reaction they want lol

He's a rogue and took Tyranny over Blackhand's.
---
just go in a pve server plz
---
it's called world of WARcraft
---
not world of HAPPYcraft
---
Sorry to hear about your timezone dilemma. I played PvP server back in original vanilla because "thats the real wow experience". After years of frustrating world questing and travel I said "F this" and finally transferred. This time around I am in PvE Vanilla and would rather quit than go back to PvP servers for just the reasons you outlined.
---
&gt; cuz elitists don't let us get into raids because unpopular spec (too many issues with mana). 
---
Don't be bad, we have a SP which is getting geared on the same level as our other casters. He farms consumables 24/7 tho to keep up.
---
If you're looking for youtube videos, don't trust anything that came out before the release of classic.  If it's a quest about the Onyxia attunement quest chain, that's different - since this information will be the same.  However, if its about gold making or specific things about game mechanics, if the content is older than 3 or 4 months, it's probably private server crap.
---
I've met several hunters while leveling my own that absolutely refuse to use feign death. What's up with that? I nearly use mine every time it's off cooldown...
---
This sounds so much fun. But. Can you get any benefit from this before you’re level 60?
---
Hello fellow Druid, I bring a small nuance to the comment above:
---
For the weapon, it really depends, but I’d rather say end of T2 or AQ40 in terms of power level. The caster blade for example is quite in par with c’thun blade but the 2 hand sword is quite close to Ashkandi that you can find in BWL.
---
After that, r13, especially for feral, can be better even in pve that MC or BWL, depending on the piece, with more stamina most of the time. 
---
But after all, the r13 pieces are much harder to obtain...
---
Yeah, decay always exists, although it's easier to overcome at lower ranks. Rank 8-9 is when you really start feeling the decay.
---
Shadow wrath is bis

Camping FP might be a thing for a brief amount of time, but it's not as full proof as it seems.  If the player is paying attention when they land, they can walk off as they are not an honorable kill for like 10 seconds.  Camping the same people consistently is not a big source of honor either.  You also limit yourself in the areas you can camp since the players you kill have to be high enough level.  Some areas also have guard who will attack if you attack someone in the area, like Light's Hope.  FP camping might be a problem for the first week or so, but the honor won't be there compared to going out and finding people, or those people who are setting up trades already.  If you sit camping FPs you are just going to get left behind and the end result is it will just be assholes doing it to troll, which is unrelated to the honor system.
---
Blackrock Mountain is going to be a clusterfuck though.  There is consistently level 55+ running in and out of the amount alone or in small groups.
---
Imagine pulling threat in onyxia as a hunter when you have a reset every 30s, it’s the warrior mostly

On my server it's all mind games. Some guild says they're gonna drop the head so another guild tries to drop 5 mins early. But the other guild knows that so they try to drop 5 mins before that... Last week the head was dropped 30 mins before the announced time.
---
That may become reality, i think they are done with classic, it stays as is, which i'm good with, at least we got it, but Blizz can't monetize the F out of it, i'd be fairly sure they are done with it after the phases.
---
Many retail players actually enjoy the dungeons of retail and aren’t rushing to get out of them. They are just so piss easy that there’s no reason to take your time. Once you get a tiny bit of gear, you no longer need a tank until you get into m+. They enjoy the challenge and nuance of the mobs and bosses while pushing themselves to pull quickly (but smartly, usually) and unlock the next higher key level for even more challenge.
---
Once you exceed a certain level of m+, you don’t do it for loot. It’s more efficient to do lower keys faster. They are then doing it to push themselves as players. Test their skills, think outside the box, etc. It’s something you just can’t get from much of a Classic after a point. The challenge evaporates, with nothing to take its place.
---
Okay I got you. Also in classic you don’t get exp for pvp, correct? So I might be better off speed levelling to 60 before pvp’ing. My goal is to get some pvp gear.
---
With matches that went on for sometimes literal days at a time, yes that sounds correct.
---
My favorite is when this happens, CC follows through, then someone starts AoEing...
---
does anyone really care , people are dying everyday and you guys are crying about 2 minimum wage casters and a kid playing a childs card game for cash
---
You missed the point, congrats.
---
They do for grinding mob normally without AOE
---
It's cheating, therefore it's wrong.

Because races in WoW are pretty significant. They are actually different species, not just slight variations of one species.

Best place to grind to from 38 to 40 while making gold for mount?
---
I've been careful on my spending, skipping certain spells and abilities that I don't use. I'm level 38 1/2, disc/holy priest, and only have 40 gold. There's no way I'm going to come up with 50 gold in 1 1/2 levels.
---
So - the question: Is there a good area for a level 38 to go where I can just grind mobs that drop decent vendor trash to help me get my mount at 40 or 41?  I'm bouncing between STV, Desolace, Arathi, but I can't find the right pack of mobs that drop a consistent amount of semi-valuable vendor trash worth more than a few coppers or 1-2 silvers.
---
It's possible of course that there simply are fewer people questing on the final levels.
---
With regards to the weighting, iirc it was something like 42 honor points for a solo kill lvl 60 vs lvl 60, then it gets halfed everytime you kill the same person again, and it is split among anyone who took part in that kill / is in the same group. It's also reduced by PvE dmg, so if you attack someone who is at 50% from mobs, you will only gain 50% honor. After all that, it's simply a matter of how many honor points you can collect.
---
At least that's how I remember it from back then :p

Tanks generate more of their rage from damage taken than damage done
---
Don't forget rogue, where he picks his battles.
---
Killing guards is never a DK... it’s the townspeople that give you DKs like trade supplies vendors and such.
---
How is this a reference to what you posted? They have no resemblance at all?
---
I was asking in zone chat for anyone that wanted to group for a quest. Had a group of four and a new guy wanted an invite. Turns out they're on the other side of the map. We wait patiently and notice they're mining all the way over. I drop them for a player in front of me, and they start whispering me calling me a bitch, and want me to call myself a bitch. We finished the quest,  and I still haven't called myself a bitch.
---
i thought it was a dwarf pickign his nose
---
Tongues introduces zero problems for a Druid. You should never need to hard cast. If you do, you have already lost.
---
But how is that a bad story? Mocking a protagonist and actually having something behind it is freakin' badass imo
---
FIRE
---
For real? That's easy AH money right there, especially if you have a friend to turn them into Free Action Potions.
---
I have engineering and skinning on my hunter and looking to drop skinning. What profession should I pick up? Gold is not really an issue. So I was thinking something like Alchemy or Enchanting? Thoughts?
---
I have. I've also played an arms/prot hybrid (31/5/15) and the latter is infinitely better for tanking 5/10 man dungeons for the additional threat, aoe, and damage alone.
---

I buffed a Mage with Fortitude and he didn’t give me Arcane Intellect in return. 
---
His name was Pindlworf and his guild name was AFK.
---
Even one of nesingwary's hunters is a hunter lol
---
PvP and PvE are different and require different stats
---
I mean its only useful for 100 mana, which is not really that much past level 20. A neat trick for sure, but like most classic tricks its has a very niche usefulness.
---
Has anyone tested how it works eith crit chance. For example if it works with shatter on a mage
---
Came to reinforce this. However if you get a chance always through a dot.
---
Anything 58+ is fine as long as people know the mobs and fights. Just slower than I'd prefer usually.
---
No, it’s 22 HEALING only. It’s a HEALING trinket. It’s not a DPS trinket. A MAGE is a DPS class.   
---
What likely happened, however, is that the mage couldn’t read well and thought it gave 22 damage/healing like you did.
---
He had pants tier 2

Except the animals we hunt with arent really pets

Yesterday a friend and I wanted to go ubrs and had to wait for rest of the raid, so we killed alliance a bit. We killed one priest at least three times before he could get into the dungeon. We were in discord and laughed how their raid is going to enrage any moment now because their healer can’t get inside. And then their full 10 man raid went out of the dungeon all at the same time and started chasing us. Some of them overextended the chase and got killed again.
---
It was so much fun.
---
Missed the moment for the meme.
---
Your race must be troll.
---
I never understood why AH peeps get mad like the guy in the picture but now you just made me realize why.
---
Danks
---
Haha well Alliances the bad dwarves too =)
---
Yeah. Up to rend I can solo heal, after Rend it's a challenge with two healers. lol
---
We are on the same realm and we run there together as a raid :D so much fun aoeing down the hordies.
---
As you undercut the AH he studied the blade..
---
But if you reach a rank, and buy the stuff, you don’t lose it right? There’s no rank req to continue using the items? 
---
So in theory you could aim for like rank 13 let’s say, and once you get there but the stuff and then drop
---
Oh please. The hunters in my guild have it really bad right now.  We've done 7 MCs, and 8 Onyxias.  Not a single hunter item aside from Tranq shot and Leaf has dropped.
---
&gt;Whats your guys gear
---
Some pre-raid BiS, some MC gear
---
&gt;how did u kill the last boss as 2 people exactly
---
You hit him until he dies.
---
I was excited to see it for 250 on my server, but then i realized waters are only going for 8 or 12 gold (dont remember now).
---
Prices are weird on my server.  No wonder lasher farming only got me about 40g/hr last night.
---
How is it any different.  It pulls info right from your combat log and gives it to you in an easier HUD.
---
True. But I’m spamming death cool and went that hits it’s game over 😁
---
I've seen a few posts like this today and I would like to enquire. Does anyone know what the fuck the warrior ability icon for recklessness is?!
---
Crusader and other enchants are on a PPM system, a faster offhand shouldn't yield more procs.
---
I'm absolutely on your side, but we know there are also flatearthers around...
---
Feel you
---
So?
---
Well that's rested. Multiply your time taken for that run by 4 and you have a normal ttl.
---
That screen looks mighty busy with all those spells there!
---
How did you people even make it to 60 without knowing things like this?
---
The fact that many of you can't see the reason that artificial wealth in an mmorpg is wrong, is frustrating and dissapointing.
---
Once BG are implemented, you can turn some marks for XP if I remember correctly but until then you don't get any xp from PvP indeed. 
---
So yes getting to level 60 first is for the moment the best tactic.
---
If golden pearls are going for 40+ gold like most servers, farm naga 2 levels below you. Azshara has a lot of level 48-49 naga. (or any enemies that drop clams for that matter)
---
Hunters...  Never change.
---
Don't mess with the Mafia man.
---
That doesnt mean he is mad tho.  I hate tomatoes.  Doesnt mean i am mad at tomatoes.
---
Knew about the one OP posted, but this is new
---
Well when you've decided to stop being mad at everyone you can decide to reread my comment and figure out what I was actually saying.
---
I'd say to use the Unyielding Maul until 25 agi comes out due to the counterweight being usable on it and not the Warden's Staff. Net threat increase, and basically the same stats.
---
Right, but my point is that BEST is not the norm, CAPABLE should be the norm.
---
This retail mentality of anything but the best is a detriment and they should be ashamed of themselves is toxic for the game.  I had a 59 TANK tell me that people refused to let him in LBRS.  The mobs are 57, why the heck wouldnt you let him tank it.  What are you losing out on, 5 minutes? Spend more time than that looking for a 60 who actually wants that shitty place.
---
Its SM Arm/Cath all day
---
Yes but you require more XP in comparison per level. That's why it takes "longer" or more kills to go from 59-60 than it does from 58-59 etc
---
If you do alot of DM tribute I would get mining. Other options: herb or alch.
---
But why though?
---
Alchemy. You can always have a level 1 to disenchant everything and send the mats back to your main. It's nice to have a 10-20% discount on potions.
---
Right, personally I'll be happy if my Druid (an alt) reaches Rank 8, since I only really want the 4-piece bonus as I intend to use the Wolfshead Helm anyways.
---
That moment when you realize you're wrong.

Winterspring, EPL, Silithus and Burning Steppes. I'll assume the coordinates on Wowhead are helpful, but haven't verified them:

WotF doesn't work on death coil

You can go to sixtyupgrades.com and plug in a level, then open up an item slot and look at the other options.
---
Warlock rank 10 head is BIS until BWL comes out. ([replaced by this bad boy](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19375/mishundare-circlet-of-the-mind-flayer))
---
No but gold is easy to acquire what could you possibly need to buy it for.
---
&gt;Can assure you healers had to try harder than usual
---
That's fine, healers can literally be afk for half the pull when everyone is 60 in vanilla 5 mans.
---
Yes, have absolutely no fear about losing your stuff once you have them.
---
(but be afraid of the grind to get the rank because words cannot express how crazy it will be to reach rank 12 and above on some servers)
---
The wow community are truly masters of reading what they just typed. 
---
Maybe when you’re too used to spamming the same attack pattern you start to think and write in the same way?
---
Didn't they learn holy magic from the humans though? I'm sure the gnomes could teach them arcane.
---
There's no new content in phase 2...
---
Yeah.  I've sold 2 already.  Warriors don't NEED that sword.  It's not even that good.  There's exactly ONE BoE epic that I could even use at 60.  I can afford it but still don't have it.  If it drops, do I really NEED it?  No.  It's an upgrade, but that's a lot of gold people can put towards their upgrades as well.  BoEs should be thought of as a set gold amount that a lucky person can do whatever with.
---
Thinking BoEs should be handled the same way as BoPs is illogical.  No one truly needs a BoE and the amount of BoEs usable for different classes is drastically different.  Just because you picked warrior doesn't mean you deserve all the better-than-dungeon BoEs that drop.
---
Lieutenant Dan became Lieutenant dwarf
---
I always do this. My friend, who tanks, loves it. Those caster banshees in UD strat are so much faster to kill when he doesn't have to LOS them. Not to mention the caster gargoyles who will pat over and then stand still casting if nobody interrupts them.
---
Just keep leveling as you usually would, trust me gold becomes super abundant 40+
---
Terrible idea. I remembered wrong, thanks for clarifying. For many classes updated r7-10 gear is almost equal to AQ40 for pvp. So we will skip the phase where pvp was kinda long and tactical and move straight to instagibbing. Absolutely terrible.
---
do hunters need 5 % or 9% ???
---
kind of feel like he got carried. not because the dungeon is difficult, but solo tanking ubrs means stuns galore on the packs past beast. So if youre a low lvl solo tanking those packs, youre going to be stunned half the time and the mobs hitting everyone else.
---
WTF
---
My life will never be the same ...
---
It’s Juventus, but you were right. I was wrong about Real Madrid
---
are we talking about Real Life pet hunting or Ingame now? I am confused!
---
The MC geared player is much stronger in PvP. The overall stats and resists make a huge difference.
---
It's not about beating someone 1v1. You're going to be facing groups of multiple raid geared players at all times.
---
Hey, Cairne never touched the stuff. He's 100% organic beef.
---
I have 35 days played and i dont want p2, there is so much to do in the game still. I only play my main and will only consider alts later.
---
For me I kind of believe that you have to be attuned more with nature to be a hunter, humans live in cities at this point so not a lot of nature
---
Too busy drinkin pumpkin spice lattes and reading rom-com novels.
---
It would take a lot of work, time, UI-space, and brain training to use the combat log to replicate what Spy does, and I doubt it would be even close to as powerful. Spy removes the need for situational awareness, dulls the thrill of surprise encounters, and when I tried it, was very immersion breaking.
---
wait what
---
What actually works better I think is to use group loot but game your loot ahead of the spawn.  Usually if you are killing these things efficiently you are waiting for them to pop up, so just kill a monster nearby so you know who will get loot on the devilsaur.  This way the skinner can literally mash the skinning button the entire time waiting to get the skinning notification.
---
Do you have skinning? I killed raptors in Duskwallow as a priest from 37-40 and got about 120g
---
Is it worth it to put an expensive enchant like healing power on my pre raid bis mace or should I wait for a better mace from a raid?
---
I'd like to piggyback on this and say to all you tanks out there... If you like CC, pull the mobs away from the CC'd mobs.
---
It sucks having \~25% of your damage negated because you can only autoshot and aimed shot because there's no way to control where mutlishot goes. If you're within 20 yards of the CC target I can't use multishot without risking breaking CC. Unfortunately multishot is part of my single target rotation.
---
Things will go faster if you make sure we can use all of our abilities by bringing the active kill targets further from the CC target.
---
Not since I learned that all hunters are hunters
---
Hopefully they don’t find me
---
Yeah, I considered it because it’s way more feasible and enjoyable for me to earn the gold using real money—but I’m not about to let tons of /played time get permabanned.
---
Agreed!
---
Tell your group you are new at it, and most likely they will be very helpful. It's what i found when i started tanking a little here and there.
---
you would need some insane burst to down him in 30 seconds, and thats if he doesnt banish you
---
Yep, you can trade recently dropped items in raids but no dungeons. So stupid. That's a change they should have put in only because we don't have the vanilla experience of GMs fixing mistakes.
---
unholy aura! O:
---
Honestly - just do RFC (it is easy as fun - can even tank as a shaman)
---
It is great for practising and you can't do much harm :)
---
Also just tell your Group at the beginning of the dungeon that you are new to tanking again and that they should take it easy on you :P
---
But no worries really. People always make tanking out to be much harder than it is. It is the DPS that is difficult. You have to wait a couple of seconds before you can do damage and that is reaaalllyy difficult :P
---
Don't Forget to Line of Sight your enemies if they are casters or other ranged. 
---
Use Battle Shout as one of you main threat Generators when pulling larger Groups. 
---
You will be fine!
---
happy birthday to us all
---
there's a new race of elves every week
---
But if the raid is full (as you stated) and no effort is being made to help the low-geared up to maybe start a new training raid so they can start to show their worth, why would I waste my time being benched? To wait for a spot to open up that was from someone with better standing than me in your eyes so a loot council can give that gear to another member of the main raid anyway?
---
Buying gold is cheating, sad as fuck and should be banable for all involved.
---
I recently did a DM:N run with two mages. It's nutty. Our warrior dps remarked that it was "fucking trivial" with 2 sheeps lol.
---
Same on Firemaw. Fuckers emptyed the AH and put it up for 3-4 times the price just 5 minutes after P2 Blizzcon announcement
---
I don't really see a good way to implement that without opening up huge griefing possibilities.
---
That wasn't cringe that was hilarious! Plus did u see the epic combo he unleashed on that mother fucker? What a legend
---
You might be lucky over at /r/magicTCG
---
I know it's not as bad as warriors, but I prefer Truestrike on my druid as well, even though it has no stam or defensive stats (outside of reasonable armor, but the Spaulders from ST offer better). That 1% hit has a great effect on threat generation.
---
My succubus' name is Lynrah. So I named my female rogue orc after her because I liked it so much.
---
Where the whole Apes guild camps the chest everytime it spawns and you have to pay them to get it
---
What is minmaxing
---
yeah, i've seen beyblades
---
Fuck
---
Likely because in lore human hunters suck compared to the rest.
---
You find it weird that people don’t like when people cheat in a game they love?
---
I did some maths and if I'm not mistaken you need to be in the top bracket for 12 weeks straight to get to r14 the fastest. You can also reach r14 after 16 weeks of the second bracket and then getting in the top bracket for 1 week. You absolutely must be in the top bracket in the final week. Good luck.
---
As soon as p2 was annouced I thought about going to the AH buying some real quick. Decided against it and waited 2 hours to watch the rest of the shit. Prices had already exploded :(
---
Or the highly coveted Tauren Rogue
---
Not many pages available in my Ah sadly.
---
Stratholme mages who can do this and pull Banshees and Crypt Fiends into my melee range without asspulling other groups are my heroes.
---
Yes but old good new bad
---
Druids are innervate and battle rez bots. If you're the one druid in the raid allowed to max rejuvenate, you dominate healing meters, but otherwise the class is very bad in classic.
---
R13 and R14 aside, because you will never come close to this items, the PvP gear is good for PvP but CAN replaced with better PvE gear from different phases, but have "no" value for PvE.
---
Counterpoint, if I may. I originally played starting about mid WOLTK and leveling through the 1-60 content was so dull then. Played on a pvp server but rarely ever saw an alli. I was ganked more times in my first evening in Hillsabrad a couple weeks ago than I was 1-70 before. Never anyone to really play with or against back then. Never mats on the AH that you needed. No competition for gathering or questing. No real risk or reward. I’m having so much more fun this time. The world is alive with people helping, hurting, being nice and not. I understand why some people are irritated by it but for my part I’m totally into it. Looking forward to phase 2 and alliance can come at me. But you better be red to me or you’re not getting out alive and I’ll remember you when I’m 60
---
My question is about how to efficiently farm Shade of Eranikus. My question is not: is it worth it to farm Shade of Eranikus? Therefore its out of the scope of my question.
---
These things appear unfarmable but there are players who know how to do it. On private server's you'd occasionally see people dual wielding Dragon's Call. Why someone would want to do that is out of the scope of this thread.
---
Or I sheep a mob and the hunter immediately multi shots. Every damn time.
---
we are together in this cruel world... &lt;3
---
lol "What is there to disagree on?"
---
Did you just disagree with me and tell me there's nothing to disagree about? :p
---
Using Shar's shadow weave I see...
---
I think I made 5G on double pages.
---
I went from Classic to Retail and although I am completely overwhelmed by stats and gear (only made it to WOTLK before I quit for many years), the quest mini stories and areas are really fun.  Classic at this point is a dull grind.  wPVP is EXCELLENT, but that's about it.
---
The potential for elemental fire :)
---
is there a page that shows all of the WoW icons in large format? I'd be interested in seeing what they all really are
---
Stuff should be decided ahead of time and made public. If your loot council is convening and discussing the loot as it drops, you’re probably one of the ones.
---
healing priest is pure torture outside of group stuff
---
Is +21 the max frost sp on green bracers?
---
Great question i never thought to ask, have so many alts 60 still seems like a pipe dream, but yea i'd like to know too. Pretty focused on my Shaman atm, which i dunno to me seems like it would be fairly versatile role at 60?
---
Paladin should be spamming R1 Blessings on himself with righteous fury on to grab considerably more threat as a makeup for not having taunt
---
in my experience its best to just not tell anyone you know and take the gold.  Having someone indebted to you can stir up bad feelings among both individuals and people never really appreciate huge gifts anyway
---
Guild means people with similar goals working together to meet those goals.  If the objective is raiding, and the main raid isn't sustaining members because they aren't helping lower geared players to get a chance to show their worth, then you'll have burn out of the main raid AND no new players to replace them (At least the sensible ones that know to not stick around using precious gaming time to wait for a raid slot on such a "guild".)
---
&gt; gold buying seems harmless.
---
You realize most gold sellers are hackers who steal the gold from the people they hack, so buying gold directly encourages thieves, right?
---
That's what's ethically wrong with it.
---
I mean, if you're fine buying stolen goods in RL, then buying gold in WoW isn't all that bad...
---
Should I get enchants on my weapons as a Rogue while leveling if I’ll keep the weapons for a few levels? Superior Striking for instance? How much do they averagely cost? There’s lots of PvP now where I level so maybe I’ll get a bit of am advantage.
---
Fury warriors can very easily pull threat off me if I'm not using an MCP especially on any fight where they pop cooldowns.
---
The wpl wolves took forever! I didn't realize they shared a spawn with spiders so I wasted a ton of time just running around looking for them .
---
Have yall ever seen a dwarf mage? Movies books etc
---
this was great!
---
You rang?
---
They were dropped on their head ass chickens
---
wtf when did blizz add time gating????
---
Yes I do both healing and tanking as a druid. That mana burn you're talking about - you need to make sure that when you pull those elementals that you don't bring them too close to the group or else the mana burn will nail you.
---
I also know to ensure that my own mana pool is depleted before I pull them. Know what I'm saying?
---
Im doing the dickmove right now.
---
My server is filled with people who rolled mage only to AoE farm everywhere. 
---
I rolled rogue, only to gank them.
---
A bit thin skinned, are we?
---
Reminds me of the mage who tried to kill me (feral tank) yesterday. One charge and maul and he was at like 70% hp.
---
Yeah, you're right, thanks!
---
You didn't understand what I said. I know you can feign with your pet active and in combat. What I said is that if you happen to time it perfectly where the pet despawns at the same instant you feign, it can/will fizzle or something. It could also be that I'm happening to do something wrong at that same instant, but I haven't noticed that yet.
---
How does the Shaman get passed the trash and how do you kill Jammal?
---
It would take just aslong and be just as intrusive for interrupt tracking and cool down usage.  Again dont use it, but dont complain that others play the game differently.
---
*cries in Stallag*
---
more like deformed ballsack
---
Ohk then just ItemRack is bugged then
---
He means if you transmute undeath to water, you’ll make 1200 gold in 60 days. In this scenario you pay 1200g for the recipe. Your net profit after 60 days is 0.
---
But if you don’t, you’ll transmute earth to water let’s say for 600g in 60 days. In this case you pay (let’s say) 0g for the recipe. Your net profit after 60 days is 600g.
---
So actually, for you to buy the 1200g recipe and make 600g of profit (where you’d be if you didn’t buy the recipe), you’d need the initial 60 days + 30days (600g/20 profit).
---
Ret is actually really strong in pvp...I guess the horde will realize that soon enough though. They counter rogues, they can blow up clothies, they can't be slowed(bof, divine shield), with engineering they have 3 ways to break a fear(bubble, shadow reflector, trinket), they can out sustain spriest if geared properly. They'll struggle versus hunters and warriors, but engineering can fix the hunter matchup if they can hit a good grenade. Once you get in on a hunter it's game over.
---
Grats but so who took the picture of you taking the picture of the screen?
---
when i hit alt z my chat goes away too
---
I don't think this sub has mods.
---
There is indeed a way up there. But it’s far from being a path.  A lot of mountain jumping.
---
Your question is easily wowheadable.
---
It's just bad players that need to buy gold. Fully agree though it's sad as fuck
---
Since you don't need the money for anything right now, you might be best holding off on selling it and check your AH every so often.
---
Make a note of the prices you do see. If you see the gloves rising in cost over the course of a month, hold off selling it until you're in the situation where you need/want a good chunk of cash money.
---
On the other hand, if you see a steady drop it'll be worth getting it sold before it depreciates further.
---
On the weekly reset, your gathered CPs are used to calculate your rating. Your weekly rating is calculated with an average of your last week's rating, and *your current standing compared to other players on your server.*
---
The Classic Honor System does not work like a straight leveling system, but as a measure of your efforts in PvP when compared to other players on your server.
---
l2p
---
Because no one wants a rogue and pug tanks roll on my gear so I only run with friends now
---
is it ok now? :)
---
It's in ALT + °
---
What professions should I prioritize as a mage?
---
Free King Kong!
---
F for the player that lost the roll
---
Irl blood diamonds
---
It's your party or raids damage I thought. A healer rolling with 4 friends or as part of the raid would share honor with everyone in the party or raid so long as they are in range. So as a healer keeping people alive is enough if your party or raid is killing people.
---
You ought to take all those points you insist on firing against me, and take a hard look at yourself. You're likewise refusing to take any of my points and making all these assumptions on my play. Do I need to start a stream just to prove to you, some unknown stranger who insists on calling everyone here bad?
---
Look at you saying "I've only run into a handful of PUG tanks that were great" - wow, **only a handful** that were any good by your exacting standards. Take a look at what that means. Meanwhile I've run with many, many tanks(and tank dungeons myself) and you know what? My measure of success is
---
1) Do we get the dungeon completed in a reasonable amount of time
---
2) Was the run pretty smooth, with no wipes?
---
The only thing we can agree on at this point, is that we should do each other a favor and put an end to this conversation. You've earned a spot on my block list and I'd ask you to please block me as well.
---
Let's put a stop to this once and for all.
---
With their intelligence capabilities, they won't be hired for anything higher than labourer.
---
say sike right now
---
Well. We sure got some good info
---
Thanks to everyone
---
Do angerforge + arena brd runs for a chance of a good epic chest from arena (savage) and hand of justice from angerforge :).
---
Then u dont have to do the grind at 60 wher3 u dont get any exp
---
If you're min maxing, you're respeccing for every raid as a mage. So your point is moot.
---
It didn't feel very casual to be honest. Probably 5+ hours most days.
---
How's the horde alliance split on grob?
---
Not normally on my sever. After you add in listing fees and AH cut you would have been better bandage and vendor it.
---
Sometimes You'll run into someone grinding rep with an open C.O.D. order that is paying more than vendor value. 
---
Rarely you will see the price spike, but about as quick as you can list them, someone comes along and starts the undercutting war back to bare bones.
---
I was today years old...
---
you ... you have your sound on and are not listening to something else ?
---
Affli: Every Warlock spec
---
Demo: Ends up
---
Destro: Casting Shadow bolts
---
At least PvP is fun for us.
---
The one dramatic rework/pruning of classes they did was about 10 years after release, in WoD, and it was massively unpopular. To this day it's often cited as one of the dumbest things Blizzard has done.
---
They take a huge risk whenever they start fucking with the core of what makes their classes, and I think it's just smart to avoid it when you can accomplish the same thing through other means. That doesn't mean every attempt of it is "good" or "fun", I personally enjoyed Legion Artifacts but I didn't enjoy Azerite, but that's par for the course.
---
As for MAU/DAU I honestly don't think it has much to do with the cash shop, I think it's used because it's a more accurate measurement of the games health. If you've got 4 million subscribers but only 2 million people playing each month that suggests problems, so MAU/DAU is simply a more accurate and useful figure to work with. I'm not in this field so I could be wrong, but just because you play the game doesn't mean you'll spend on microtransactions so there is probably a more accurate statistic in regards to that behavior.
---
Considering rerolling on Grobbulus. Can someone give any insight on the ratio between horde and alliance?
---
MY UI IS NOT THE SUBJECT (and my desktop is beautiful). Cheers
---
&gt; You in the same comment accuse me of pulling numbers out of my ass as well as acknowledging I have 2 60’s that took me 7 days.
---
Those two aren't mutually exclusive. Let's take a look at what you initially wrote (and hence, what I replied to): 
---
&gt; The average for hitting 60 is probably about 8.5 days.
---
I asked you to support that claim. I listed arguments as to why I viewed your claim with criticism. 
---
&gt; Therefore I must have some idea of how long it takes to hit 60 for a person who maxes professions and does dungeons. I have taken entire weeks off of playing WoW and still have what I have character wise.
---
No, you have an idea of how fast it *can* be done. You try to use an anecdote of yourself to defend your claim regarding an *average*? When you clearly aren't even remotely close to the average yourself? What made you think that was an argument supporting your claim?
---
&gt; All of my friends with jobs have had 60’s for weeks.
---
This still doesn't support how you can claim the average is 8½ days, especially considering you haven't responded to the arguments I've put forth, based upon general data and not personal anecdotes. 
---
&gt; And you admitted yourself in your last sentence that they are in fact slow, “just having different priorities in life”. Okay cool, then they clearly don’t invest enough time or care enough to matter in the game catering to them. 
---
No, I did not. So if someone isn't playing more than 3 hours *per day* on average, they are slow? Sure, compared to you, maybe. But compared to the average? You still haven't argued in a way that supports that. 
---
&gt; Also tagging me in a classicwow forum because you really want to win an internet argument that no one else is looking at at this point is pathetic.
---
Also, not responding because you realized you didn't have anything to support your initial claim (other than useless anecdotes of yourself and a couple of friends), while the other person presents valid arguments is pathetic. 
---
Trying to argue against valid arguments with anecdotes and still attempting to take the high road? Good for you, lad.
---
Lol right? The fuck is this guy on about
---
We tried everything and the pets died and we died a lot of times.
---
Mark targets for kill order priority, learn which abilities generate the most threat and should be used on rotation, and ALWAYS do your best to Line of Sight caster mobs if you don't have someone to CC them.
---
It's A.
---
If you look at their backs, it's clear that they only have 1 spine.
---
If you ban a bot immediately after detecting them, the person botting can better pinpoint what triggered the ban, and fix it for next time. 
---
Also everyone accuses players of botting and the vast majority of times it's not a bot.
---
On days like this, I love playing on a pve realm
---
Should be decent gold to get selfheal/reflect gear and aoe farm dungeons as prot, can probably do some crazy shit in sm/zf/stratholme
---
I like the Tetris style layout of all your spells :) adds to the nostalgia
---
&gt; I know the addon doesn't go against the TOS in any shape or form
---
So basically you want it removed just cuz.
---
No, the comment was removed, probably by auto mod. You might not be able to see that it was removed it without viewing it from another log-in. Try reposting or contacting the mods to see why it was removed.
---
Before Classic launched, I re-upped my subscription to try out Legion. I was doing some dungeon, killing some naga or something, and I aggroed a seagull. A level 112 elite seagull. And it killed me. I have fought the ancient elemental evil of Ragnaros. I have slain countless dragons. Thrall, warchief of the horde, lent me his hammer. But this seagull is apparently so badass that I need 4 friends to kill it?!?
---
Yeah unless you have the extra gold, definitely better to prio other things :)
---
Shame in retail gold is useless unless u buy tokens ehich are dope
---
There is a huge difference between world BoEs and Foror. The chances are slim a world BoE will drop in a dungeon run. However, if you equip the BoE right away and it's an upgrade, then need on it, otherwise greed. 
---
But most people are selfish assholes.
---
I mean, you created the example, I only elaborated on it lol. Also, fire can be a lot of fun and is completely viable for leveling.
---
I got control of world chat last night and banned all the other enchanter who were LFW.
---
If they wanted to promote their services I charged them 20g to rejoin world chat.
---
Dick move? Maybe
---
Profitable? Sure was.
---
mabie 20-30 mins
---
Same. 300 skinning and LW, 300 fishing, cooking, first aid. Lots of wpvp, which meant a lot of dying for me. 
---
Some afk time, but that's probably only about 10 hours.
---
Lmfao you don’t seem to understand the massive advantage hunters have in open world. Take care bro
---
I tried solo, I couldn't. They killed me easy.
---
What?
---
Will the new expansion fix wow?
---
That's a straw man and I'm not arguing any of that. Blizz doesn't define them as illegal, the o.o I responded to did. Don't be so purposefully obtuse because you wanted to deliberately misconstrue what I wrote.
---
Get a job.
---
Ranking points are awarded by your honor in ralation to all players in your faction on your server. 
---
If only one person PvPd and only killed 1 Horde per week, that person would get Weekly Rank 1  points and get rank 14 in 6 weeks.
---
'strategic maneuvering' yeah, it might be a little harder for you to permastun oneshot noobs. Tough life.
---
True. I remember doing exactly that.
---
What is your group comp?  Generally you go right (counterclockwise) since the Guard doesn't pat there.  Have a rogue/druid steath solo and get the key starting that the right side but really anyone can get it if they are smart.
---
I would recommend taking a rogue as you can pass all the bosses with no mats (no orge suit or frost trap) very easily with a rogue.
---
Focus on your homework kid.
---
Don't trust mages. I have had 3 Healing items rolled on by mages so far. 
---
They are the new hunters. 
---
I only needed one of the items that got rolled on by mages but I also lost one to a mage. It hurts. It is unneccesary. And it can defenitely be avoided if they just gave a tiny bit of Attention to what they are doing.
---
But whelp. As you said. Vent about it. Get over it. Get it. Replace it :D
---
*Flames Incoming*
---
Thank you, this was exactly the answer I was looking for. I felt like I was doing dungeons wrong. I haven't really used curse of shadow too much or amplify curse. Will definately mix those into the rotation. I hadn't thought about sacrificing the voidwalker for hellfire but that makes a lot of sense actually. What add-on do you use as a threat meter?
---
Is it illegal in your country to get a part time job in 8th grade or what? Never to early to grow up and be a man.
---
To the detriment of everyone who didn't join the gold rush back then. First couple of weeks in BfA were hard and I still have to farm and craft almost everything myself. Flasks and potions, enchantments or buff food... Prices in AH are just too steep.
---
ZF zombies would work, it's just a matter of how many you could pull at a time.  A mage can pull the whole room with practice.  paladin probably could if you rotate your cooldowns and use potions but you're still taking a LOT of melee damage and it might be tough to do enough damage to them all before you expire!
---
But for real, starting off with holy wrath, consecrate, and then judg/seal light to avoid bubble as long as you can.  Then you can consecrate again during bubble's duration.. But I don't think that's enough DPS to bring them all down.  
---
Holy wrath is about 500 damage AOE.  Consecrate is about 380 for the full duration.  900 damage together, 1300 once you consecrate twice.  I just don't see how that's enough damage even given the ret aura / block damage you'll get as well.  Zombies melee you for whatever it is (probably less than 100 per hit) but given 3500-4k hp that won't take long to kill you!
---
Nah, it was mostly people who took vacation time.  I ran into plenty of people who weren't hardcore top players but were just super excited to play classic because they started wow late but were worried about having the time to play with work &amp; life so they decided to seriously level at the start.
---
The biggest thing is none of them were high or drunk...  I've since leveled a second 60 and I have to say the only poor performing players I've run into(pugging all leveling dungeons and most of the max) on either char were either drunk or high...  Or at least they used that excuse I guess
---
Fun? Play mage or hybrid druid.... maaaaaybe a rogue if you don’t play BG’s or group PvP.
---
You know I was gonna check that post history and see if this was legit or not and hook a brother up but your only 2 posts are begging lol
---
Herbalism and whatever else suits your needs. I would suggest alchemy to pair nicely and guarantee more money per day selling arcanite transmutes on cooldown
---
If you have Shimmering Flats is good and the beasts in the lower half of  STV.  the vendor trash is good they both drop things that sell for almost a gold per stack.  Or you can go for elementals in badlands
---
Tab maul generates more threat.
---
That’s interesting as I already have Questie. I’ll update it tonight and take a look at the settings.
---
At the end of the day, the loot is going to someone. All anyone really cares about are the big ticket items. Thats where loot council sucks and dkp is better
---
I played War2 for years, and I'm just now realizing that Ogres were completely nude.   Somewhere under that belly flab is an ogre dick.
---
You may indeed have some WoW time. If you get a job, you can afford WoW time! Amazing how that works! :)
---
This, they probably get hundreds  of reports a day from salty people who've had their nodes stolen by real people.
---
For a long time I always thought it was a guy pulling back on a bow string.
---
I always thought they should have just used the Warden ability icon from WC3: http://classic.battle.net/war3/images/nightelf/spells/blink.gif
---
Flexibility did not exist. You’re ignoring everything pre-WoD. Also, tier gear only came from raids. You may have had 5-6 options for what slot you filled, and those tier sets may have been WF or TF, but you still needed at least your 4 set and in many cases in Legion a 4 set and 2 set. Even though those pieces could be upgraded they only dropped from specific bosses, once a week.
---
Once you rolled the dice you could not roll again.
---
In BfA this was changed to Azerite Armor, reduced to 3 slots, and the pieces you equipped were less definitive because you may go for certain traits baseline with the secondary and tertiary traits having marginal upgrades. Compound this with the random pieces from your weekly box and then further more with the random AA pieces you bought with residium, a resource that could really only be gained through endless grinding to buy a random piece of loot you had to sim to see if it was a .1% upgrade over your current piece. This was compounded again with Benthic gear. Random piece that needed a random affix that needed a random gem socket. Also the essences, you don’t just earn these, you have to eternally upgrade them. And don’t forget about the fiasco with the HoA and AA fir the first 8 months of the expac.
---
This stuff isn’t driven by fun, it’s generated by a need to require players to log in for their chores, every day.
---
Imagine being a US company punishing someone for their free speech and pro democracy. Tsk tsk
---
thats more or less how i do it. Check date and check gear used in the video for availibilty in classic.

i watched a rogue doing some stuff in BRD, but then i realized he was wearing AQ40 Gear.

Unfortunately he will not be allowed to hit 60.

Resto Shamans here are some skills to have ready for effective PvP: 
---
-R1 Magma Totem ready to drop for stealth protection
---
-R1 Frost Shock for cheap slow / damage when healing DPS not in group
---
-R1 Earth Shock for cheap interrupt
---
-Windwall Totem for added protection against ranged DPS
---
-Stock up on Fish Oil / Shiney Fish Scales for Water Walking and Underwater Breathing (great utility to have when needed / bringing the fight to water)
---
-Consider Improved Ghost Wolf for mobility utility (it's a fair investment, but mobility in WPvP can really change the tide if a fight -cough, cough, DRUIDS, cough, cough)
---
I'm level 27, I get killed regardless. I'll be used to it
---
&gt; After you add in listing fees and AH cut
---
This seems like you're trying to trick me into doing math. I WON'T HAVE IT
---
Im new in reddit
---
No you may not. Now do your homework
---
Would I ever need tailoring for BiS gear?
---
I've been healing a lot of dungeons and even some MC and ony as 31/0/20. Took some learning due to the mana issues but I use down ranked versions of each heal. Rank 1/2 chain heal and a couple ranks down for the healing wave spells. I only use highest rank spells for when in real trouble. For raids I try to be put in a group with a resto shaman who has improved mana totem and mana tide. In raids, most fights I have to mana pot still.
---
I love people coming in here claiming druids are the boring one that clearly don't play one.  They just read on Reddit somewhere "druid bad" then forgot to wipe off the drool and chip crumps that have begun to solidify on their dirty shirt as they press one key in raid on their mage.
---
Imagine living your whole life up to this point just to passive-aggressively message a stranger rude words because of petty disputes on a virtual fantasy auction house where no real moqney changes hands.
---
I've realised something about the conspiracy against sword and board Protection, recently.
---
It doesn't actually come from tanks themselves.  As a tank, why wouldn't you want to be able to press a single button (shield slam) and generate 600-1k threat?
---
The popular insistence on Arms/Fury/2h/DW or literally anything except Prot and a shield, comes from DPS players.  If you look carefully, you will notice that the narrative changes.  They will tell you either to use a 2h, or to dual wield, which are two different things; but the one thing which is always consistent, is that they never want you to use a shield.
---
DPS players don't want to be required to literally do anything other than spam maybe two buttons at the most, from the first second of an instance to the last, and by doing so top the DPS meter.  Topping said DPS meter with the least amount of effort (whether mental or physical) required, is literally the only thing they care about.  
---
Prot is not wanted, because that requires DPS to actually think and engage in restraint.  They want any additional difficulty to be passed to the healer, (which is what happens if a tank is not using a shield; because mitigation is lower, the tank's health drops much more quickly, so the healer has to work harder to keep the tank alive) so that they can focus exclusively on what they want.
---
Lasher farming + herb imo is the best spot for pallys still imo.  I’m getting close to 50g/hour (give or take) after selling herbs on AH.  You also don’t need that crazy of gear to make it worth your time.  I tried ZF a few weeks back with worst gear and knowledge and couldn’t clear it in under 20min.  I don’t think it’s worth it quite yet, if ever.
---
Any open world spot, such as sorrows hill in wpl, which is an insane farm spot, is completely over run with other people at all hours of the day.
---
There's a hunter on my server who intentionally griefs any mage of the same faction who is AoE farming in WPL.. Pulls mobs off you as you mount pull then feigns death, aggros mobs and drags them into your blizzard and tries to break your nova effect. Been there every day for weeks.
---
Just use a VPN
---
I guess something along the lines of the hunter catching the enemy's eye and them going 'OHH A SHINY' and chasing him instead of their original target.
---
What does it actually do
---
SL in group PvP blows because 30yd range and around 10% less damage output and no good burst.
---
Well irl; it is forbidden to sell products under the average cost of product to protect economy in certain fields; but wow isnt real world; there are no costs and most importantly that guy is big loser nerd
---
WC3 Riflemen were all dwarves, as were Mortar teams. There's a long tradition of dwarves being ranged units in the Warcraft universe.
---
This is correct, I managed to stay alive for awhile has a feral druid after the rest of my group had died and he didn't cast sleep.  i got really lucky with a ton of dodge/miss so I took very little damage. 
---
However, I've also killed it a few times where the sleep was being cast CONSTANTLY (like every 15 sec or so) and another fight where we took him down and there was only one cast over a minute + long fight.
---
You and me both buddy.
---
You mean much faster?
---
You get 3 blue items in the chest, and would lose one for killing Cho'Rush, and another for killing the Captain. That would leave you with only 1 blue item in the chest.
---
Your odds of getting a ring in the chest are much lower when there's only 1 blue item in the chest instead of 3.
---
Oh shoot really? I never noticed lol.
---
Still, padres are the bomb. Just need to find a tank willing to run DM:E which is a challenge for sure.
---
You can't force an item onto someone and take away their dkp against thier will...
---
So no the loot doesn't always go to someone who will use it to benefit the raid. Been doing this for 15 years the only way to ensure loot is getting distributed evenly across the raid is to take away the ability to point hoard and just distribute it evenly. Also why would you want the eye of div to go to a random priest, it should go to your best priest. Why would you want the band of accuria to go to a DPS over a tank? A fair DKP system allows those scenarios, you can modify the system but then you're just doing officer loot without calling it officer loot. 
---
15 years, only had loot drama once. We had way more when we used DKP.
---
Depends. I'm not even full prebis and I've two shot (ambush-backstab) lvl 60's Warlocks and Mages. I've only ever been owned by a Warlock if I'm doing 1v2 or 1v3 because they catch me out of stealth.
---
Would be amazing if you took this picture with an actual camera.
---
&gt;I'm level 38 1/2, disc/holy priest
---
&gt; Is there a good area for a level 38 to go where I can just grind mobs that drop decent vendor trash to help me get my mount at 40 or 41
---
Hello, you are gonna need to head back to desolace. Farm the beasts on the **east** side of the mountain range that is just **north** of the Valley of Spears. The basilisks and vulture things drop the best vendor loot. Hyena packs look scary but just dot them all up w/ SWP and fear bomb them. Choose one to wand down, then finish them all off w/ wand as they run back. If you find they are too low level to be worth your time- there is another spot full of beasts to kill down on the southern part of the territory, **east** of the Manoroc coven.
---
You may not get the 50g you need by 40 but you will certainly make a lot of gold this way.
---
Alternatively you could head to Dustwallow Marsh and farm the raptors up in the northern part of the territory. This is better if  you have skinning, otherwise I would stick w/ the desolace farm (it's what I did).
---
*laughs in windfury totem*
---
BRD has a lot of great healing items for priests.
---
Try to snag some full BRD runs.
---
Split your moves on as many targets as you can handle. For example a 3 mob pull I will charge, demo shout, defensive stance, sunder target 1, sunder/revenge 2, and sunder/revenge 3 and then return to main target 1. Hold taunt for any mob that loses aggro and use 1 spell on. Dungeons are progressive so by the time you are 60 you will experience pulling huge groups/ mobs that are hard to hold aggro
---
The DM trinket for rouges is quite nice
---
I get accused of botting at times because I buy listings immediately after posting in the AH, but all I do is refresh new listings and snag some deals.
---
Hell I've been accused of botting twice just because I fished for a long time without moving. I was in guild chat and discord lol
---
Holy shit! Well done my friend, never noticed that!
---
Makes sense. Trying to farm in Felwood and there has been a Tauren Hunter there for 3 days CLEARLY bottling. Jw when he will get tf out.
---
They decided "number of classes per faction" or some shit was a funner metric than "shit that makes sense and is fun". Only meth can account for choice that dumb.
---
I cannot accept this.
---
Reflect damage helps a ton get shield spikes buff thorns/Ret aura  when possible the little bit of threat helps if ur nervous about aoe pull u can carry a stack of oil immolation and have some bombs if engineer or rage potions.you will no doubt lose aggro as players will ignore skull in pugs just be ready to taunt. Threat plate addon helps to see what mobs are focused on you.
---
Rotation prio single target
---
Revenge
---
Shieldslam
---
Shield block
---
Heroic strike(not often in dungeons will be rage starved)
---

---
Battleshout
---
Demo shout
---
Revenge if up
---

---
If healer gets aggro u can use battle stance mocking blow if ur taunt is on cd already
---
If you go for the Ele/Resto hybrid you'll be very versatile. Damage is great and you're formidable in PVP.
---
I've not tried it personally, but from what i understand from others, you're healing output will be adequate to get you through all phase 1 raids and any other raids you have on farm.
---
The prot paladin is literally the turtlelest turtle that ever turtled.  With stuns.
---
Horde or alliance? Brd staff off emperor, cape off the torturer if alliance. Two quest rings.
---
Google priest best in slot , or just go on wowhead bis lists, it's a good starting point.
---
Ogre staff is better than those two given the stats and crit chance. Crit chance is roughly equal to about 15 sp pwr for a well-geared lock and Stam/ Int are a bigger priority in PVP.
---
And yet, rogues..
---
Why though?  It's not BiS for threat or utiliity.  It's wholly mediocre but it looks cool.  If they want a decent, cool looking sword they can buy it.  Prices are tanking STILL on that dumb book.  Why should everyone else give up  a few hundred G for that meme?  
---
To be fair I'd pass it to a guildy who wants to use it.  I don't run with pug tanks.  I wouldn't make an exception if I did though.
---
Was with 2 other people a long time ago in Loch Modan doing that elite ogre quest. The Wanted one. We are clearing the last pack into the den and a party of 2 walks up and tags him and his 2 body guards. We disbanded our party and asked for invites since there would have been 5. The mage polys the boss and I wand the sheep to make him pop back out. We ask for invites again. They keep trying to do it as 2 and I keep hitting the enemy they poly once. They wipe and send us invites. We decline and form our group again, kill him and leave.
---
Blood elves look more like a normal human than actual humans in the game. Look at the human model's forearm and hand, the forearm is thicker than the upper arm and the hand is bigger than their whole head.
---
I'm at about the same level, just starting STV and only plan to stick around until I hit 43. Then I plan to go to feralas and farm for a couple levels.
---
I have a deep, long standing hatred for uldaman and plan to skip it entirely. Around level 45 I'll head to Tanaris to quest and spam ZF
---
It's this. There is a TON of great healing stuff in BRD. I did 55-60 almost exclusively healing it, and got basically everything I needed from there + all my quests.
---
Sapped a human Paladin while she was halfway done farming a Black Lotus last night in Silithus, then I started herbing it in front of her and she bubbled, cancelled bubble and tried to fight me. I just used blind and finished herbing it and vanished. Was my first one ever so far but I feel like lotus nodes are 100% going to cause pvp encounters.
---
They don't even manually ban them anymore if my knowledge is correct they just use their own bot system to ban which is actually shit. Because it's known to also ban legit players
---
&gt; I will say I did get cussed out by one guy telling me to never tell him how much to post items for and how dare I blah blah
---
People are too fucking proud sometimes.
---
Mages are easy to "one shot" if they don't have frost armor, mana barrier, or ice barrier &amp; if they don't blink.
---
I don't see how you would 2 shot level 60 warlocks unless they are in greens with a few blues and have no demon armor (and don't see you coming)
---
A competent warlock shits on rogues in p1.
---
PvP doesn't use PvE stat calculations. Defense has zero impact on PvP.
---
do you get the 'deserter' debuff?
---
Wow.....so actual communication really worked?
---
How exactly do the training points work for a Hunters Pet?  I have noticed the last couple skills i trained my pet with, I was actually able to train it with less points (almost half) than what is listed as the number of required points.  Is there some kind of "discount" at certain levels?
---
Also, how does the unlearn skill work at the pet trainer?  Will I recover all of the training points and then I can use them only for lets say Bite 6?  Oppose to have spent points on Bite 1, Bite 2, etc.
---
Follow this path and end up another sheeple.
---
Dwarven rifleman were a staple unit in warcraft3 which is why they are a thing.

---
The macro makes it so it casts on who your mouse is over instead of who you're targeting so you don't need to switch targets.
---
Ignore below, the archmage rob is BOP and requires 300 tailoring. It is the BIS robe for a long time.
---
Yeah, I have auctionator, the price is not very high on my server.
---
Your points are, "I play the way I play and your way of playing sucks" how is that a point? Go ahead, post a stream. I want to see you lose aggro and not complain. Just because a tank isn't good doesn't mean I don't like them or bitch about them. I'm just happy to get dungeons done without wiping too. 
---
That doesn't magically mean those tanks are good though. If we go by your low standards then great, 95% of tanks are good. With you feeling that way it's no wonder you feel no tanks are bad and everything is dps's fault.
---
Thank god I'm on your block list though, whatever the hell that means to you lmao. I'm probably not even on your server.
---
Sixtyupgrades.com will give you a great list of items that you can pick between for gearing targets. Since it doesn't just give "the absolute best" you can pick/choose what you think it realistic to get.
---
SEE CAROLUS RISE
---
Nah, I work full time and have played wow since it came out and I never had the elitist mindset. I play the game to relax and have fun, the moment some gnar mage starts freaking out that the dungeon is taking too long is the moment I start looking for a different group to heal.
---
But that dinosaur mount with an AH on it is pretty neat
---
Think its pretty close to 50/50
---
Life of a pvp server- get ony buff only to die outside BRM
---
clicking power word shield man jesus christ
---
keybind ur shit
---
Disagree. Druid healing in raid has significantly more buttons and complexity than other healers and 3 easily distinguishable healing specs if you get bored of one. 
---
I guess we may have different ideas of what’s boring, but I would say spamming exclusively flash of light 1000000 times is boring. Same with spamming exclusive chain heal.
---
English people use hahahaha, latins use jajajaja and portuguese use huehue or kkkkkkkk.
---
Can I heal brd at 54? I will definitely look into it, thanks
---

What Class is this BIS for?
---
Imagine a rogue that doesn't  vanish DC
---
I've stopped playing, haven't got enough time to work and play at the moment which is sad. Can't justify spending 6 hours a level grind when I get home haha! Plus the horde ganking really put me off playing on a PvP server!
---
From what I've heard, Blizzard bans in waves, so him and most of the other bots will be gone all at once the next time they decide to do it.
---
Not roll, loot counciled early on to some of the tanks for threat gen. Then a rogue got perd/cht but quit game for personal irl reasons. Now I'm pretty sure all the viskag/bruts will go to rogues. We keep a dagger rogue in each raid and they have perditions too, now. They're dropping pretty much every rag kill for us. We finally got our first viskag after 12ish ony kills. I highly recommend dropping to several 20man ony groups. Slow and steady wins the loot. You'll gear everyone out super fast and probably be more consistent vs when everyone cares about meters and messes up the p3 transition.
---
The ToS is extremely broad. Whether or not it goes against the ToS in this case is up to Blizzard.
---
It breaks "the spirit of the game", much like safespotting guards in towns does.
---
It is really close to 50/50.
---
This is embarassing
---
tl;dr according to this thread, every class sucks go play another game.
---
Real answer though, is tanks and healers. The person complaining about mana users/casters needs a reality check.
---
Talking about inefficient space usage... Jezus this is horrible
---
The cost of the skill level is the difference of the current cost and the previous level cost.
---
Its viable in the sense that it can be done, and im pretty sure its better than full on 'memespecs', but youll be quite a bit worse than equivalently geared rogues and furies (as horde the difference is smaller). If you have good dps gear, maintain a decent tank set, and can offtank when needed, tgeres probably a raid spot for you somewhere, but I doubt its in one of the raids that currently clears ony and mc in 4 hours.
---
But we knew the phases beforehand so that's not really a valid complain
---
Oh my God you guys are starting to lose it
---
I kill all the lasher packs + take all the herbs I can without pulling elites. That’s it.  I pull two lasher packs at a time.  Takes about 10min to clear and 3min to reset on alt.  I know I can get below 10 with some practice and I’ll be right above the lock out timer get 5 runs an hour on.
---
Only when your tank generates shit threat.
---
That's what you said. Twice. You actually started your own rubbish.
---
The asnwer is in the name. RET as in retar....
---
It's trash for a warrior.
---
How would you feel if an addon made it so formshifting doesn't break CC for you anymore?
---
It's a vital part of class kit that's being negated.
---
Really? I am pretty sure I notice a difference in how often I crit a prot warrior vs a dps warrior.
---
In the beta they could be mages and then when the game launched they took it away :(
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha
---
Ain't begging not allowed in this sub? Mods please..
---
as a mage you have great mobility and great CC. should be fun fucking with ppl in PvP, use Frost Nova and Polymorph a lot haha
---
&gt; Even one of nesingwary's hunters is a hunter
---
But did you know one of Nesingwary's hunters is a hunter?
---
No, it was similar except the silhouette was of the warden.
---
I feel like it went under the radar in Safe Haven cinematic when it showed those assasins actually being invisible. It's been a debate since WoW vanilla whether rogues were just being super sneaky when stealthed or full on invisible.
---
Charge is W or QW depending on which stance i'm in
---
Intercept is W or ZW depending on which stance i'm in. 
---
W is a macro that charges in battle stance and intercepts in berserker stance. Q/Z change into battle/berserker stance.
---
I find this pretty convenient
---
Someone in another thread made a good point that it just takes already given info from combat log and makes it an easy to use interface, similar how other addons work just fine. Although I'm not a fan of the spy addon, and I wish it would get broken, I don't think it should be anymore.  If you don't like it that's fine, don't use it. I dislike the entire thing about the addon so it will not be used, I like more surprise elements like, seeing the # of people around you wanting a battle, and then getting close only to see 3 more ranks of people, where as the spy just says # of people nearby. Let others have their fun their way as long as it doesn't break tos its fine.
---
MC or Ony ain't going any where. Just get there when you get there.
---
Yeah for sure. Some groups might not be willing to take you on a full run, but you should have no issues doing it. 
---
When I started at 55, we took a bunch of guildies from 50-56 and did maybe half a few times until I started finding higher level DPS to take to the end. 
---
It's pretty good exp either way, and half the stuff you need is in the first half anyway!
---
Yeah I don't tend to go "left" it's drop down on the raised root and just right, adding in the hydrospawn boss (weapon drops that you can sell or just vendor well and extra chance at essence of water) stops you getting locked out.
---
Absolutely useless
---
Pretty sure this is completely wrong
---
Night elves were very anti-fel magic though, that's why Illidan was exiled for absorbing Gul'dan's skull and becoming part demon.
---
Then that comment, which was directed specifically at someone replying to me, probably would be for you huh
---
Should be easy farming places like sfk for those twink items
---
welp I am deleting my mage now
---
 horde4life
---
&gt;This stuff isn’t driven by fun, it’s generated by a need to require players to log in for their chores, every day.
---
Another way to look at it that isn't as cynical is that it gives players who want a reason to log on said reason. If you remember back in Vanilla, and even now on Classic, and later early expansions this was a common complaint. People wanted endless shit to do, because they quickly got done with available content and found themselves bored.
---
I happen to agree that "World of Chorecraft" is a thing and I'm not a big fan of it, but that doesn't mean I buy that they've completely abandoned trying to design a game that's at the end of the day trying to be fun. This reasoning of yours can be applied to virtually every design decision in any subscription based game if you're cynical enough, because it's in the developer/publishers best interest to keep you playing. 
---
I'm sorry but it's clear as fuck we're not gonna agree and I'm getting tired of repeating myself, and reading repetition, so I'm going to duck out. I'm not saying I'm right or that you're wrong, but we are in disagreement and I don't see a sensible resolution coming up any time soon when you've got this level of cynicism in your back pocket.
---
Thanks for the info will look into it in morning 😊
---
i dont know
---
Higher block/dodge/parry will also push crits off the table just less so than defense does for pve.
---
I enjoy the irony that as you're insulting the class, you can't bother to spell words properly.
---
Didn't know you could do conditionals I'll try something like that. Thanks
---
ROFL
---
Twinking- best part of WOW
---
&gt; But most people are selfish assholes.
---
And this is why a majority of in game players are fine with everyone rolling need.  We don't live in a utopian society of morally perfect individuals.
---
Depends on what you want your professions for?
---
Making your own gear? Making money? Do you want to have to invest actual time in them or just have them on the side?
---
I'd say some good options are:
---
- Alchemy + Herbalism. Quite easy to stay on top of without having to go out of your way to gather herbs. Provides good passive income and pots to use while levelling.
---
- Skinning + Tailoring. Probably the lowest maintenance combo. Just skin the beasts you kill for quests and make things out of the cloth you get from humanoids. You'll be able to make yourself bags and some pieces of gear as you level.
---
- Mining + Engineering. Requires the most effort and will likely cost you gold as you level instead of generating any gold. But gives you even more tricks as a mage with the various trinkets. There's also the [Green Lens](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10504/green-lens) which can be BiS with the right random enchant.
---
- Tailoring + Enchanting. Allows you to turn the cloth you get into gear and that gear into enchants. Similar to Engineering, if you try to keep your Enchanting level high it will likely cost you money. It can be the hardest profession to make money on too, since you need to actively monitor/spam the trade channel. You can't just throw your enchants onto the AH unfortunately.  
---
You could also take Enchanting just for the ability to disenchant random drops and quest rewards you don't want. But I'd say you'd be better of vendoring the quest rewards and sending things to an Alt for disenchanting instead.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Amazing shit aye?
---
Most tank builds should use the anger management talent in the arms tree. Keep up to 25 rage when switching stances is awesome. You can sometimes use charge ro build initial aggr an then switch back to def stance
---
Depends on the group. A full run is probably at least 90 minutes if not more if the group is lower.
---
Dude players are so bad in classic that I get whispers telling me I'm really good because I use counter spell and sheep patrols/mobs behind our healer.   
---
I sincerely hope most wow classic players don't drive. They have 0 awareness of sorroundings (I do play in a low pop server so probably that is why).
---
Helpful?
---
Good.
---
Keep politics out of the game
---
This is why some warriors recommend using 6% hit later around AQ patch
---
It's because we're tired of your shit!
---
What happens when you play a hand hold nerd server
---
Update your add ons.
---
Not very appealing?
---
Defense increases your chance to block, dodge, and parry.
---
Just try it and if you hate it, that's fine.  I mean, it's fine anyway, but I played two warriors in Vanilla and I think this is just such an improvement.  It kind of turns stance dancing on its head, to be something you only step into after you've done moves.  So you do whatever needs to be done, and then you dance back to wherever you want to be.
---
The specifics don't really matter, but charge for me is Shift e and Hamstring is just h.  Then I have keybinds to go back into whatever stance I actually want to be in "in general" for that fight.  Usually I tank, so I do my opener and then switch to D stance if I'm not already there.  
---
Perhaps Charge is not needed for you because you've already combined it with Intercept.  Try Hamstring and Whirlwind then.
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't let you. And their corpses were there for like 30 minutes so I don't think they found a way up either.
---
Right?
---
At least you didn't lose a 100 vs 100 roll tie d/t your name - only to never see this again.
---
Never in my life seen such a complicated way to take a screenshot
---
Yeah. It's literally the same thing. Those of us who grew up with text speak on the internet rofl'd and lol'd all day long in chat, but there's always that one person who says them aloud and it sounds really weird and awful, regardless of your age. Context is key, you say it where it's expected and it's fine, you take it out of its context and you just sound tragic
---
What server time did this raid happen? Sorry that I missed it
---
Pfft, thats funny man.
---
Oh that's a fair point, I'm a priest and saw lasher farming! I don't think it would be time efficient to add it in, my bad.
---
Please for the love of god keep it out of trade.
---
You can press any bind as fast and middle mouse scroll. What difference does it make? People that don't use CS is not because of keybind access they are just bad.
---
I'd say more than 50% of the dungeons I run are complete pugs.  Of the remaining 50%, most them them usually have 1 person from outside of guild.
---
As soon as I log on I post in /lfg  Tank lfg/lfm for whatever dungeon I want.  I just don't get many whispers from rogues, also can't remember last time I had a druid in group either dps or healing.
---
In what world would a hunter stay in intercept range? I have screens of schooling fully geared p1 rogue and warr on my 52 hunter in mix of greens and blues
---
No I said it right the first time.
---
Maybe if the content were difficult loot council would make more sense. This is some faceroll memetier shit. Once your tanks have gear the raid should be able to decide who gets what via spending DKP. Your dps warrs arent using might, and your rogues arent using full nightslayer anyway. Your priests, druids, and pallies use very little tier as well. The fact that the tier loot blows in MC for most classes doesn't justify resort to loot council.
---
Taunting when you already have aggro... read the tooltip...
---
Depends on what you don't like about retail.  
---
I didn't like the legendary system it felt cheap that everyone had the same "legendary" I don't like the azurite or leveling the legendarys to get new abilities. not a fan of current pvp.  Tanking and healing don't feel the same in retail.  
---
We will see how it goes I hope they do fix it.
---
Horde has a green quest reward Cape option. Rings are chains yes, fordrings seal and whatever the horde equivalent of songstone of IF is.
---
In Lore, a lot of the major Warlocks were mages first.
---
I mean maybe? But you're under no obligation to help them. Just ignore it and move on.
---
I've asked questions like that here before. Sometimes you also want to be able to ask follow up questions or see what range of responses you get as well.
---
I don't see any world where Aragon fits the hunter fantasy over warrior fantasy. He never uses a ranged weapon at all lol.
---
Honest question, what proffession besides alchemy would you take for some passive income if you want to be a raid logger?
---
If a mage piece drop and no one bids DKP on it, then it goes to greed roll. It’s going to someone. On top of that, a lot of guilds have DKP decay.
---
gnomes can jump three times their height.
---
Omg this is amazing
---
So incredibly uncalled for
---
Ah, Fairbanks Horde!
---
But yeah joining a good guild will solve all of your issues.
---
Join the lookingforgroup channel. It will make it easier for you to find a group/
---
its ok, at least you didn't lose something like Thermaplugg's Left arm to a hunter.
---
Even more nonsense when you realize the space goats who crash landed in a spaceship could be hunters before humans could.
---
You're on your way dude! Keep up the good work!
---
The main point of my post was that you don't benefit from flametongue or windfury totem if you already have a weapon enchantment on, but I appreciate the "um actually" to my post from over a month ago.
---
You see as Mage, all our hard comes from getting the gear and it shows in Raids! :P
---
Don't worry. DPS Warriors barely get any loot in raids. You'll be decked out in tier 1 before some of your warriors even get a raid item.
---
Vanish is broken.  Rogue is gimped ATM.
---
We were all noobs once.  Just be cool and don't be afraid to explore and try new things.  If you aren't already in a guild, I encourage you to find one and maybe find a senior or more experienced rogue to show you the ropes.
---
This wowhead thread begs to differ https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=67949

540 def cap reduces crit by 5.6%, but as players have about 20-30% crit it doesn't matter that much.
---
As a druid, I am looking for an addon to automatically remove my current shapeshift when I want to cast something. I am currently using macros, but I have more spells that I need than macro slots... Anyone knows something that actually works ? 
---
An addon allowing you to have more macros than what is given by Blizzard would be nice !
---
Yes, technically Viskag is better for human warrior tanks and Deathbringer is definitely better for orc warrior tanks. 
---
Try convincing your furys and rogues of that, though.
---
Lmao nerd shitter go to retail. “ I can’t stand getting killed in a game where there is no punishment for dying” pathetic
---
Because dungeon set 2 is a completely different set that is gated behind massive questlines, gold, reagents, extra boss fights in dungeons that dont agree with the progressive patching we currently have.  
---
They didnt "rework" Dungeon set 1 into Dungeon set 2  
---
They reworked the original PVP set and REPLACED it with the new set.
---
... using which statweights?
---
I'm still not convinced that there's just that much of a difference between any of the setups. I've seen it go every which way. Your weapons will matter way more than if you're running standard pre bis/6pc SC, etc. That said, pigeon holing yourself into a specific set bonus has just never been fun to me, especially when you need 6 pieces of said set. I can just say "yep, this is clearly better" rather than having to pull up a spreadsheet and trying to theorycraft every little thing. Regardless, high parses are and always will be more about what buffs/consumables you have.
---
According to everything I’ve found online this is incorrect
---
tbh, skull is generally the last mob I sunder.  Of course I hit it with a shield slam before I proceed to sunder the other non cc targets.
---
Gaming is serious business...
---
And these are the dogs i meant. This might be a difference that stems from my language, but i wouldnt call the dogs we hunt with pets. In estonian we have 2 words: lemmikloom,which means pet, and koduloom, the difference being that a pet is somebody you adopt for your pleasure and not a specific purpose i.e cats, dogs(not hunting dogs), fish, turtles , birds etc.
---
Did I say I didn't have 1 pre bis???? No.  I didn't say that at all.
---
Basically what someone else said already, a hard hitting 2h is going to be your best bet. If you want specific items, I would go Smite's hammer at 18, Verigans Fist at 20, Corpsemaker from RFK at 29, Bonebiter at 35 from the SM quests but it'l probably be a little hard to get it that early, one of the 2h weapons off last boss in Uldamn I think require 43 to equip, Gatorbite Axe or the 2h mace from Princess in Mara require I think 49. That'll pretty much be good until 60, the next thing I got after that was the polearm from Rend in UBRS at 58 but I never used it cause my polearm skill is 1/300 and I'm lazy.
---
Are we all forgetting about Impale build Prot tank? I use this in dungeons and tanking and never have a issue holding threat. But I also have Quel'serrar
---
Youre blind
---
 Were talking about blue/green equipped lock with one epic, no spell power enchants and only using +40 shadow spell DMG elixir, not some fancy hard core DPS.  
---
Your rotation add like 930 threat per that first 10 sec, which still requires 300 DPS with AA/HS to tank it which no shield tank has.  
---
Look great tanks can make world of difference, they do. That is not what Im arguing about.  
---
All Im saying is, that if you're impatient enough to start hammering 2 seconds after pull, and you happen to crit 2 times in a row, then for the love of god, stop casting that third one, because if it crits, there's no tank in the world that will hold it... assuming decent gear, which brings me to my original point  
---
\&gt; If you can go ham after 2 seconds and not worry about aggro, that just means your gear is shitty.
---
As a tank since classic's launch: only 1% of DPS do this. I'm building a Boomkin armor set as we speak so I don't have to deal with you DPS monkies anymore.
---
I would rather Oomkin, than attempt to get agro from you fools who wont let me build agro for even a full second.
---
Pagle was great forever alliance. I recently swapped to a pvp server but lots of Alliance on Pagle!
---
I mean you are welcome to say lol or lmao or pepega as much as you want but good luck getting a decent job or finding a mate :)
---
Madden is a game and there's plenty of hiking in that
---
Did I say I have zero items??  No I didn't.
---
Do you mean having the attack ability active or the actual weapon swing? 
---
Either with The attack ability in a bar and making this icon big (bartender) or any swing timer (quartz)
---
First time I encountered it I was sooo damn confused. Like where did this guy come from???
---
The bright white eye is a good start, move left and you see the side of a nose.
---
hunters are the best class
---
Then why would you need to be hit capped? Humans and orcs can’t utilize a racial? Are all other racials disabled for pvp?
---
Warlock is a fantastic solo class, it's also just generally one of those most fun and we'll designed classes in the game. Tons of variety in the spells and talents. Great choice as long you you like that damage over time play style.
---
SC is the new pre Bis, the old prebis was based on Private server data which had a different hit cap requirement
---
R14 grind will probably be done by cross faction collusion, at least at the higher ranks in early stages of phase 2. There is a limit how many people can be promoted each week, so it's good to have some communication among the people who go for R14. Because otherwise all grind like mad, but it would reward only some with the rank promotion. Usually there was a deal that XY people will be ranking this week, while the others just cover their weekly honor decay. Most likely you won't be able to leech honor effectively as the opposite faction will kill you and your faction won't defend you because you are not a part of the pact.    
---
Also if I'm not mistaken, honor is being split between the people who tagged. So their honor will be split with you if you tag along (=they get a little less honor because of you), so they won't be happy about it. I wouldn't recommend trying to do this, it won't be the best for your reputation.    
---
Btw you probably won't be able to grind 1 hour longer than these guys, because those who aim for R14 will be playing all the time except while they need to sleep and some of them even sharing accounts to play 24/7 :D But if you really plan to invest that time and go for R14, do it your way. Not as a leech, which wouldn't be as good in reality as it sounds in theory. At least that's what I think :)
---
I said "probably". I never even stated it as a fact. But that doesn't matter to you. HANG HIM HIGHER!
---
Some pvp gear will not come out until phase 6 like the spell pen trinkets and other stuff that was released in later patches.
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
The houses of my country do not have grass to cut
---
That's indirectly the shareholders turning the game shit though, since they put pressure on them to generate more and more profit. Do they come up with new ideas to make money? Probably not, but do they sitt in earnings call and say "that mount thing sold very well, make more mounts to sell!"? Probably.
---
Like they are responsible, not for all direct design choices obviously, but they can easily push for more of feature X since it showed good metrics and profitability.
---
And game development is very different in this regard than normal software development. I don't imagine in investor in say Facebook sitting there calling for certain features, it's a very different product.
---
As a tank, can confirm the threat drop.
---
From my understanding its base plus gear combined.
---
Because it’s not fair... it’s cheating.
---
6 class cap for races because of the character creation UI
---
It's even more efficient if you have rank 1 agony and reck set up in your toolbar. You can jockey that motherfucker back and forth like a stray dog.
---
i have a hunter and its not that easy to find a group, you usually compete with Rogue and Warrior for the gear so they dont like inviting you. For raid i do agree there's less competition except for rings but who cares
---
I almost lost my coffee you fuck ass.
---
why use many word when few word do trick
---
Yes mages have it so tough, with their amazing dps, amazing utility, great PvP viability, and ease of farming mats and gold.
---
Not saying it can’t be done with a whole raid team helping to make it happen. Though any boss that needs a taunt is a no go. People have pulled off crazy shit over the years. If your raid team is so far advanced already that weird builds like this are an option, go for it. But your not going to do this with a casual guild or a guild with only one raid team/night.
---
To me this is something to attempt in a content drought for funzies. A large part of the player base is just now hitting 60. Like if your raid team is sitting on BIS and are just looking for weird things to do for the luls in an alt raid have at it.
---
I’d sooner look at a Druid or even Paladin tank before utilizing a rogue tank though.
---
Casual playing as opposed to speed leveling. If you’d spent 5hr/day speed leveling it would have been quicker.
---
Yeah, phase 2 will probably cause me to quit... I only have limited time to play now. And at level 41 I don’t think I have enough time to make it to 60 before D Day...being killed constantly doesn’t make the game fun... hell its not phase 2 and I was being camped by 2 allies last night... I don’t want to think how much worse it’s going to get...
---
Lvl 19/29 twink items are much more safe and lucrative.  Come phase 3 when battlegrounds are released a lot of people are going to be looking to gear out twinks and prices on these items are gonna skyrocket.
---
Why you exposing my alchemy like that bruh, now everyone gonna think they Elric with a philosopher's stone
---
that's some weird shit, bro
---
i mean. maybe turn off ALL your addons then try it
---
if that fixes the issue try turning them on one by one to find out which one it is
---
the typical horde 2h fury 20/31. I started in leather gear first but died almost immediately so switched to tank with 350 defense, while maintaining 6% hit cap. I dont want to be that guy but i think im not the problem here. Will try with another shammy, will see how it goes
---
Looks like herbalism and alchemy make some decent coin and you can make yourself buffs which is nice.
---
RIP non-60s.
---
Sorry for the loss of your tits. That’s too high a price to pay.
---
Are you using any addons, if yes you could try to eliminate them. 1 by 1. I have noticed some issues with fishing buddy clashing with some other mods.
---
Yep
---
I want that sweet mark of the wild. Mages are nice too or a priest that has spirit buff lol
---
I have 3 hunting dogs. Ill take one out to shoot pheasants and another 2 to hunt raccoons, they all 3 like to chill on the couch and play fetch. 110% they are pets.
---
I pull a cheeky - "gona vendor \[wand of +healing\] for 3g - anyone want it for 5? " in general chat in the zone I am in - very often get sales for gear with good stats. 
---
Hate paying the AH fee for an item that will probably not sell.
---
Pretty solid meme to be fair
---
Borrow is quite generous.
---
Will Feral is a tank?
---
No one thinks this from what I tell. Druids literally do it all and do it pretty well... .other than oomkin
---
Warlocks will be desired for all raid content because of their curses buffing the group as a whole. Hunters fall off toward endgame. What we've seen is that you don't need massive numbers to finish the content out currently.
---
 Level 60 priest here. Had 30 minutes to kill and I was in Hillsbrad..  Someone calls out a ganking level 42 hunter and priest. So the crusade  begins. I went to the yeti cave and preceded to kill them and 5 other  alliance for the next 30 minutes in that cave. Did the 5 that weren't  PvPing my people deserve to die? Yes, they were capitalizing on the  death of my people... no mercy once blood has been shed I say!
---
Sounds like an addon problem to me
---
Yes, it's several weeks of Honor grinding at higher ranks because it's a percentage of total honor.
---
Nooooo! You twinking in classic? (probably a stupid question with an obvious answer)
---
I am the GM and I run dungeons with guildies all night.
---
I take dreamfoil out of my own inventory to make fire pots for Rag
---
A good GM is always willing to help the little guy!!!
---
Problem solved! Lol
---
Meh, prices rise and fall naturally throughout the week based on the day and time.  If you just figure it out, you can flip arcanite for much, much more.
---
This is why every warrior should also have at least the Valor set for when they're out alone.
---
I've replaced most of my leather with plate from MC and LH Helm, so now I'm a wall that hits like a truck. GL rogues.
---
Yep you can tell how good a tank is by their ss cpm
---
You are awesome!
---
padre's pants drops in DM:W
---
its from wowhead dummie. i didnt say anything lol, scrub
---
Ya your right i was thinking of cheap shot.
---
It will take a minimum of (I think) 8 weeks for someone to reach Rank 14 from the get to. That's due to the way the ranking points are awarded with a cap and decay.
---
the nerve of some people. did you report him for harrassment?
---
As far as I know, the best way to do it is to camp people questing from 48-55 because they put up little to no fight. if there's one change that is to be done, it's this. this should not be a thing.
---
And Aedak is there with them? I mind controlled that dude in the lava in BRM once and killed him when his roaming healing team wasn't with him.
---
Yeah, that's definitely a lightning's blade horde guild.
---
I skip hinterlands entirely at 54 I still only have m like 4 quests there not worth it.
---
The shaman blue pvp pants are actually almost just as dope but malistars is huge right now, so much armor. I lost a roll on it too but loot distribution for the shaman in our raid has been fair so far, we all got 2-3 good pieces at least
---
It's actually my fleshlight.
---
Genuinely laughed out loud. Usually I'll type LOL when something is kinda funny and the air rushes out my nose.
---
Now that will definitely ruin their day
---
Why is that awful? The speed? Why are 2Hs with fast speed are considered awful?
---
Deja Moo
---
I’m not counting on the economy to repeat the past. The AH actually seems kind of dead now. I find myself vendoring most uncommons. I wouldn’t invest in rares/epics unless somebody messed up on their listing and set the price really low
---
Mine has been doing it as well. I've been right clicking the buff to come out. Pretty annoying tho
---
lol nice "correction"
---
Rank 10 is blue helm and shoulders
---
Rank 11 is mount
---
You every played a druid?
---
.... Like even once? Because youre doing it wrong
---
This is the main reason I actually have spy. Both of those characters go on my KoS list in spy and I put a note as to why. Then I get a nice alert next time they are in my are and it's fucking murder time.
---
spent 650g  on skerem for the recipe. buying undeaths for 1g, and selling for 18g. itll pay for itself in about 38 days, then pure profit forever!.
---
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WITH THAT UI
---
Is there a lazier dungeon design in the game?
---
I’m a lv 37 warrior and having trouble knowing which stance to use. I’m half arms and half fury on talents. I want to be a prot tank endgame, but not for leveling. I currently use battle stance with my whirlwind axe, defensive stance when dungeon tanking with dagger and shield, but should I be using berserker stance and am I do those are stances right? Any explanation about stances would be appreciated. I only have done warlock b4 so this is all new to me
---
People in mind guild have been having really weird ping issues this week outside of fishing, and tons are having issues even connecting to bnet. I'd give it time.
---
Why are 2Hs with fast speed are considered awful?
---
Ok thank you thats what I kind of figured.  I wish it showed that real cost of the training
---
How weapons kill works above 300. I knew it helped and that at 305 you essentially required 3% hit less. But someone explained to me how additional weapon skill works in that it really just reduces the penalty for glancing blows and a very small amount of increased crit chance.
---
I never know about those aspects as my main was a Shaman from Vanilla through BFA(and only ever played Resto or Elemental). Never had a max level melee that I was interested in raiding on so I never had to learn the differences between caster and non caster DPS.
---
Now I’ve leveled a Warrior to max and am learning a whole bunch of things I just never needed to know or bothered to learn. 
---
(I also never played Ally until WoD, so my leveling experience is completely different than it was in Vanilla)
---
Depends on the friend.  I would never do this with online friends, but I totally would in real life.  
---
People in my guild always ask for 20g-30g for items off the AH.  I'm level 57 with 250g after powerleveling alchemy from 0-300 and buying a ton of other shit like mooncloth bags.  If you're 60 and don't have 20g, you're not going to have it in a week when I ask you to pay me back.
---
&gt; I am the GM and I run dungeons with guildies all night
---
yah, that's why ppl suck u off and u think everyone does this for everyone else.
---
Possible that mage just misread. Still I understand that OP is pissed, although there are better options and he should just work on getting 60.
---
I finished up Un'goro crater, then went to felwood and did most of the quests there . I am almost level 54 now but last night I grinded the ape cave in Un'goro for a couple of hours. The greys they drop + skinning was able to get me a lot of gold. Plus there were small thorium viens so I was able to get my mining up to about 265 from 255. I want to run sunken temple but I can't find anyone to run it with. My plan now is to start farming the bloodelves in Azshara as they are one of my favorite farming spots. After that I'll probably be level 55. Once there Ill probably start finding somewhere else to level.
---
IDK why, but I've always associated Dwarves very strongly with the image of a gun and a pet bear
---
*precedes to accidentally go into shadowform* KICK HIM RIGHT NOW.
---
1. So now we're talking about a 52 instead of 50.  
---
2. Yes, it can be done if you have the jump on the war. But you don't have much room for error (bad kiting pathing, aggroing a mob, getting resisted / missing key abilities).  
---
Never said impossible, I just said "schooling warriors left &amp; right" is an overstatement.
---
The two-headed ones are actually pretty smart.
---
Warlock. I like cheating at PvP and using only half of my long-dead brain cell at PvE. But I am thinking about rolling an alt Resto Druid after listening to Naruto outro music of the first episode.
---
Feral tanks are viable off tanks all the way through naxx.  Cat druid dps are currently in their strongest state but will only fall behind as more tiers are released.  Boomkin/ele sham/enhance sham are complete memes and not to be taken seriously.
---
The price is based on supply demand, if 10 ppl want one and there is one, expect a higher price. The price was higher because there were more buyers than sellers, so buyers were checking AH daily to see if someone finally looted one.
---
If you have 10 in bank and have 1 up on AH always, it will look less rare and sold lower than those wowhead comments. Other finders of the item will just undercut u aswell.
---
Also, the profit margin is really low. Buying a rare recipe from Ah ell give u more (hide of the wild for example)
---
This is the best.
---
You're not wrong.  In Orcs and Humans, Orcs only utilized demonic magic and Humans utilized arcane and holy magic.  The whole Shaman thing didn't come in until WC3.
---
I've got ns head, shoulders and gloves. Dr mh/oh, ony neck, strikers mark. Only 2 rogues in my ony group. Other one has 2x bf and viskag; so at least it's mine as soon as it drops. All our tanks have band of accuria, so now it's finally going to start going to rogues exclusively. I just need a little luck and time. Then again, I am the guy who didn't get dr mh until the 53rd rend kill, and then I did another run to help attune a guildie and mh dropped on #54 too.
---
Yeah he can probably shoot them to put them in fight mode
---
I got a decent job already. Are you implying that you can't change your vocabulary and manners when in a professional setting?

Dude, you got downvoted and I got upvoted cause thats how we all read it. Cry some more pleb.

No, it's Phase 3
---
I've been maining mage since vanilla and I didn't know what this, or half of the spell icons for mages actually are..
---
What helped me the most was watchin a few different  pvp guides for my class! They explain what todo what not todo and how to counter certain scenarios....macros are huge as well...in classic it’s all about knowing the in’s and out’s of the class...so my advice is to just watch a few videos and practice the technics they offer
---
The fight ended in appropriately dramatic fashion with several deaths and a final chase which is why Edwin’s body ended up down there.
---
&gt; a completely unneeded epic item
---
was it boe though?
---
&gt; He's going to be subject to poor capabilities of holding threat vs. his 60 counterparts.
---
Not really, since you usually ask you dps to focus either an assassin or dragon lady caster, you have enough time to focus the others. Just land a taunt on the main target when it goes out of stun. You can't tank assassin if you solo tank they gouge you and every mob just run everywhere
---
Only "dangerous" part is the higher chance of taunt resist after the agro reset of bosses
---
You can run up the mountain and jump a bit to avoid the cave altogether. But if they don't know that route.... gottem
---
Phase 3 reputation item
---
Like what?
---
How can you NOT take advantage of the double SB? Being a Warlock in dungeons is like playing with matches, lol. I'm level 44 with +187 shadow damage, so I'm already squishy from the lack of stamina gear.
---
Yep. Blacklisted him with our entire guild.
---
Yeah, good point. It's a retcon but it's been established for so long that I often forget about Orcs and Humans, haha.
---
Hahah all good.  I might give it a try for the hell of it, but don’t think it will be worth it.
---
Oh right. Thats DM East
---
Seal fate (assassination) spec does well once you're geared a bit. Lose your only aoe source though so...bleh...
---
Yes.  Against the spirit of the game.  People that buy gold are losers.  Taking shortcuts.  Probably pull the same sht IRL.
---
&gt;listing fees
---
*listing deposit
---
If it sells, you get it back. As long as you make 5% more then vendor price then you should always AH it. Or just COD it to one of the many people buying runecloth in trade chat.
---
Never mind that Dwarves, not being magically inclined, is an odd choice for a mage icon. Whereas an Archwizard and someone who almost held off the Scourge makes perfect sense thematically.
---
Do mining in silithis
---
Shadowmeld into a surprise mind control.
---
I usually don't heal locks between pulls unless I'm full mana and everyone else is full health.
---
Ha!
---
Yeah that could probably help a lot for PVP. PVE I think the racials are kind of useless.
---
dude your ui is cancer

In classic there’s no skill level restriction on disenchanting.

Cheap Shot, Vanish, Gouge, Kick and of course Blind.

I love my toolkit.

Iron Man Challenge? &lt;3
---
Number one thing I noticed while doing PuGs in MC on Rag is that most of the melee dies half way into the fight and was the main issue everyone
---
Just tell your melee in the fight to not go in and start attacking Ragnaros again until after he says “taste the flames of sulfuron”
---
How would that work? Curious, because that sounds great haha

---
Short answer: no
---
Longer answer: professions don't just = free gold. You aren't gonna make gold from skinning unless you go out and actively skin. Can I ask why you HAVENT gotten a team together to farm Devilsaurs? You only need one other person, maybe a herbalist / miner...
---
If you take enchanting, you are gonna need to put work into it if you want gold. Why would you make gold disenchanting and selling low level blues when there are probably 10000+ players on your server who had this idea. You could even check AH yourself and see if it was worth it.
---
Whilst I agree, he's successfully playing the game still, chill your beef before it rots.

Its not new pre bis, it was always pre bis...

Im thinking the same thing. My alt already has alchemy and tailoring. Debating getting my bank alt to 5 for disenchanting, but there are lots of soulbound items id still have to vendor

I leveled up engineering to 240 and took Gnomish spec, to craft a handful of things before I drop it and re-level to go with Goblin spec. So far I have crafted the Gnomish Battle Chicken and Gnomish Death Ray. I play a Warrior and don't really care about PvP (for now anyway), but I do play on a PvP server. Is anything else from Gnomish important that I should make now before dropping it? I don't want to just blindly make everything because my inventory space is already a problem with carrying around both tank and DPS gear everywhere, so I just want to make things I might actually have a use for.
---
Real chud hours here on WoW Classic huh?
---
I usually played with a mage, warlock, and hunter and that tended to mean lots of drinking after most pulls anyway. Honestly seeing g some videos the pacing in 5 mans almost seems better with a paladin because everyone needs to rest/fight/rest.
---
Well yea, but why would you reroll based on how they are in pve? Most classes consists of spamming a few buttons and are generally pretty boring to play in pve imo.
---
Warlock one was funny.  
---
Otherwise it reads like a game of how many hyperboles do I have to use to be funny.
---
Everyone is in Trade by default

There was very little actually said in the deep dive that I’m not inclined to preorder the game just yet. Their sentiments towards the game seem to be in the right direction but you never know until we get to test it.

I think I'll probably be hitting stuff with a big sharp stick! I really like the two handed sword aesthetic.
---
blacksmithing / skinning are ofc the main professions to take on warlock
---
Starshards is where it's at
---
Or it’s just a large ribcage
---
Because it works
---
I do a lot of dungeons without tank, 2x mage 2x rogue and healer. Sometimes it's even easier cause people are more focused. Definetly it is more fun than normal run
---
I dropped skinning for enchanting it can be ok but expensive to level initially
---
Nah I'm Horde and would have definitely of understood. That wand was a pretty nice upgrade for me even at level 49. I just did that quest last night.
---
I mean gouge interrupts cast too. So you could always gouge the next cast. I think its funny when we are mostly through the dungeon and the first one pops up. Its the ultimate sign of a noob rogue to me.
---
That first film is like 80% of all rogue videos haha, good luck though!
---
And I thought [Whirlwind's icon](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_whirlwind.jpg) was some kinda bat-like claw holding onto a golden ring for the longest time, not an actual sword silhouettes and a swoosh effect!
---
Still wondering how NaCl is an allowed name on an RP realm.
---
Like the Summoners in Scholomance!
---
Disenchanting dungeon blues was a great money maker at the start of my server... I was running BRD and LBRS non stop, and DE'ing items that would normally sell for 1-2g and selling the shards for 5-7g.
---
Prices on shards plummeted though, to 2-2.5g now on my server. It's occasionally a little gold here or there, but it's not much and not a huge money maker. It's better than nothing, and will be useful for getting nexus shards of BoP gear in the future, but all in all it's a meh profession not leveled. Still better than other profs unleveled, since it's basically passive gold income, but it's not great.
---
Yeah, I see what its like on release.
---
Classic WoW did upgrades the right way. They felt/feel impactful, whereas retail they were just handing out rares like candy, it was next to impossible to be undergeared to the point of gimping yourself for the leveling journey. Classic is nice because not everyone is the savior of Azeroth, being handed everything and worshipped by NPCs all over. You actually have to work for stuff, and it's very rewarding.
---
I mean.. I understand your issue, but Perd's blade is BIS for us for threat for a pretty long-ass time, so when we have warlocks and warriors and you rogues up our ass for threat... /shrug
---
That being said I still passed the first two Perds blades to my dagger rogues, but eventually it'll be mine.
---
*"And he would beat scissors, but he can't* **FIND** *scissors, because scissors are invisible"*
---
Accurate representation of battlegrounds.
---
I'm also new to the Honor system, does this mean there will only be X numbers of players who can be rank 14 at any given time?
---
fun ;-)
---
there was no vanilla 1.13? who knew!
---
Still doesn't change the fact that Dwarves don't exactly have a lot of connection with mages lore-wise. Humans and Elves do. Gnomes like tinkering with everything. Dwarves... not so much.
---
I stand by every thing I said.
---
What server you on?
---
I would say cast bars is worse then spy as it gives you a competitive advantage, where spy just notifies you of the combat log. 
---
  Spy literally has no competitive advantage, afaik it only tells you when people in combat range stealth or are in the range. I used to be with you on wanting it out of the game, but after listening to some arguments I feel otherwise, it's fine until it gives a player that leg up.
---
Feral tanks very strong. Better than warriors until Nef. :(
---
So you mean to tell me that my warlock used to have Kezan's Unstoppable Taint in my ears?
---
Kinky.
---
Dun touch meh nodes mon!
---
There's a pretty good add-on for warlocks called necrosis which helps you with cc if you are new to the class
---
Post BWL, Mages open up for spec options.  It's the immune and high fire resists that make mages one button heroes.  Once you have the option to work in Scorch or Ignite as viable raid specs, it does change a bit.
---
Or players that can’t/aren’t willing to commit hours of their time spent playing the game farming for gold.
---
Speaking of, i was incredibly mad when my "Save the king" questline that also spanned ~20 levels ended way early.
---
6 pc / 2 pc is BiS... [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net) confirms this with MAEP values...
---
Any rogue from Vanilla would know to look for MAEP vs looking at places such as wowhead or icy-veins...
---
Basically saying do it on a 35 alt.
---
Is there an actual macro limit?  I didn't realize that at all.  
---
I don't think there is an addon to automatically cancel forms either.
---
You are very well spoken I love it
---
You can't vanish from DC or the subsequent fear. And by that time you already have dots on you.
---
Obviously not but it's a bad habit to get into. This guy was saying pepega so much he either had formed really bad habits or was trolling. 
---
I know you can change your behaviour in professional settings etc but trust me, it's not good to be faking who you are for the majority of your adult life.
---
what does it mean?
---
I definitely get what you’re saying. 
---
In WC3, dwarves are primarily Dwarven Riflemen, which is probably where that comes from. 
---
Also, it’s maybe less prevalent than the “heavily armed and armored” close combat version, but Dwarf lore in a lot of fantasy universes has a focus on gunpowder.
---
It's very doubtful. We don't know the exact results that were desired by the changes, so it's pretty hard to determine WHY those design decisions were made. 
---
Also, as a side note, go to hell Ole Miss.
---
That could be any big nose, beard havin' mothafucka.
---
Warlocks are more fun then mages at endgame. Way more complex than just casting frostbolt. But farming shards is futile
---
Lol.  No.
---
Exactly what I used to do at his age.
---
If you want to help him quest just follow him around without being grouped. Let him tag mobs and help him dps them down. This way you don't hurt his xp by being in a group.
---
How is this better than puggle - genuine question
---
As a warlock I love being able to add this utility to groups.  Banish, Enslave, Seduce, even fear if used carefully are handy tools to have and it makes me sad to see many Warlocks with only hellfire and lifetap on their bars. 
---
Hell a healer the other day was complimenting me on using Curse of Tongues on some casters to nerf their DPS and had never seen a warlock ever use it before, lol.
---
He also said "dwarves" when he clearly meant "everything, and also StarCraft"
---
yeap top 5 in most my raids as a hunter...
---
Well the way you feel/think is just outright wrong
---
This is wholesome af.
---
Or playing a recording?
---
I have been really working on this for the last couple of weeks. I am running 20/31/0 build at the moment for tanking dungeons and still being effective at raid healing.  Currently I am decently geared Judgement helm, spell damage gear, tier 1 pieces for raw stats, crest of retribution etc. Really think I could speed up my farm with Skullflame Shield and Demonforged Brestplate. My experience so far:
---
* ZF Farm - 15 - 25 mins pulling the scarab room three pulls at a time, pulling zombies 4-6 at a time, kill the boss get the chest, and reset. Roughly 30-45 gold and hour to get lucky and significantly harder. CD will probably be used if you get 6  or more at a time. 
---
* Sorrow Hill and the Crypt- Usually do 2 big pulls outside and 2 big pulls in the Crypt, LOSing the skele mages. Sometimes I get the rare mob at the crypt 28-32 gold per hour, got some rare drops for it aswell. Really Easy probably can speed this up and be more efficient.  Sucks if its contested but mages never got to the crypt. 
---
* The Western Plagueland farms - 3 to 4 huge pulls around the house. For the Mages always LOS either into the farm or the house (which usually has a chest) 20-25 gold per hours. Its easy, but I hate it.  Overpopulated probably best to go during dead times. 
---
* DME Lasher Farm: I am not a herbalist but I got roughly 30-35 gold from here. I do it when I am waiting for Jump Run groups/Tribute Runs/Want a peaceful farm. Its easy, safe if you are on a pvp server, and profitable regardless of your profession. There are two book spawns on both sides of the room that you should look for. You can kill a couple lone demons too for a chance at felcloth. Usually they drop about 20 silver. 
---
Dungeons runs I haven't explored from a low level just cause I have been helping my friends by grinding them through. Curious to see SM/Gnomer/Razorfen Money.
---
Well according to one Warlock I'm a dick for not helping him gank low level horde and letting him die to two mobs while I was farming gromsblood for raidpots. A nearby druid explained to me that him (the druid) and the two horde in question were all perfectly chill until this moron of a warlock showed up and started trying to 2v1 the horde, failing everytime.
---
At the time I was trying to process the incredibly vague "There hordes here" that was said to me, while he just stood there and let two hyenas kill him. He seemed to believe that since I was max level I was obligated to be his bodyguard even though by all accounts he started it in the first place. About 30 mins later long after I had left the zone the druid whispered me again saying the lock was still trying to kill the horde and trying to make a gank group.
---
Part of me wonders what the two horde were thinking through the whole thing. Probably laughing, same as me, at the angry warlock with a chip on his shoulder.
---
Take a break. Spend some time on another hobby. If you’re having trouble getting on the computer it’s not an issue with wow.
---
I mean, you outrange plenty of classes, have +13% all damage with succubus, and are only missing Conflagrate as far as burst goes.
---
Is SL as good as destro in a PvE style dps role? No. But I think that SL is viable in most situations.
---
I have enjoyed countless times when the mage pulls a mob, as a huntard, I can dash my pet quicker than a tank can to said mob, blow the two abilities to get massive aggro onto it, then make the pet go back to the tank, pulling the mob along with it.  Tank then picks up the mob and hasn't had to move at all.
---
Servers are different. I can definately see things being "better" on yours.
---
Mine doesn't often have a C.O.D.  buyer, and the buyers we do have are usually above vendor price and below bandage price.
---
Yes and I will play my mage in a later phase. Not very interesting atm.
---
I was going to say the same. I’m doing a dissertation on Lovecraft and it’s the very first thing that came to mind. Really great job.
---
I made a lot of gold on private servers using leatherworking.  I had devilsaur, hide of hte wild, and eventually corehound belt recipes.  Check the AH daily, buy mats low, combine, and sell for profit.  It worked well, I was over 1.5k gold by the time I quit.
---
The other fun combo which is doable now that DM is out was dual fiendish machettes with lifestealer or even lesser elemental slayer if you're on a budget. Hilarious for farming elemental invasions, but yeah still doesn't hold a candle to a rag wep like BRE.
---
I’m confused. Where are the naked chicks?
---
Well I typically behave like that while playing
---
exactly why I still haven't completed "what a long strange trip its been" for retail
---
fuck pvp
---
Thank god, someone else with a brain!
---
Though if you are using distracting dagger, mugger's is overkill if combat dagger.
---
Ty, do you know what it’d be used for by any chance? I checked the raid potions and it wasn’t listed
---
&gt;Feral TANK: No one really needs you or likes you but you are there to take care of their trash. Literally. No endgame for furries. But if you are a furry, you will have fun anyway.
---
Bullshit. I love feral tanks because I fucking hate how greedy warrior players are. Warriors are the new hunters, and people bend over backwards to let the jackasses ruin the game for everyone so that they can feel good about themselves.
---
Yup, I don't have a problem with that mindset itself. The game is great because it's different things to different people and all of those people can still find exactly what they enjoy and just do that. It's just a problem when you close your eyes to something and then claim it doesn't exist lol.
---
https://i.imgur.com/xAp8f0I.png
---
Its a sword that's been stabbed through someone and coming out their back.
---
REAL SHIT!
---
Absolutely. It's a shit design that was a technical limit not a design choice. 
---
Fuck no changes.
---
There are tons of margins like this. But world Epics aren't a good one compared to some of the others. Elemental earth was 20 silver each at launch, now it's 1.5g, it will be 5g each when AQ releases.
---
Maybe it's just my server but I've had better luck just hanging out in the zone or area where the dungeon is and responding to General chat.
---
Nah dude, if you gank greys in WoW you clearly have real life issues and probably need counseling lol.
---
I work at an urgent care clinic.... we are getting to cold/flu season early this year. Or as I call it "I hate my life" season.
---
Blackrock Mountain
---
Pleeaasseee do some research on keybinds, that 2-3 seconds it takes you to click something could be the difference between a wipe and you saving the day
---
I hate your UI.
---
Are you using standard action bars or an action bar add-on?
---
Warlocks are always desirable in dungeons, raids, and pvp. They have a utility toolkit that saves everyone else time.  They are harder to play than hunters, but arguably one of the strongest classes all-around.
---
i didnt get how you didnt get that this was the joke
---
You can switch to fury and clear those dungeons, sure, but I wouldn't advise it, especially if you're running with pugs. You never know how decent your healers are going to be, so forcing them to work harder isn't really advisable. 
---
Fury spec in dungeons is not fun at all as a tank, I tried it once and immediately switched back. Not having tactical mastery is crippling, to say the least. Further, you claim you've got BiS gear, but I'm sure you don't, because you mention UBRS - which has exactly 0 pieces of BiS gear available. It has pre-raid BiS, but I wouldn't advise a tank wearing blues to switch to fury spec to tank anyway, because you wouldn't have the survivability. You also don't mention if you're wearing mitigation BiS or threat BiS, which can make a pretty big difference for fury spec tanks. 
---
Finally, fury spec is incredibly overhyped on this sub in general. For most guilds/players, it just doesn't make sense. Will it work? Probably, but you're really putting your groups, especially your healers, in much tougher situations by doing so, and right now there's absolutely 0 incentive to make the switch. No group's DPS is currently out DPSing hard enough to be threat capped, and 95% of tanks switching to fury spec aren't spending the time/money to get consumables that successful fury tanks are using for their runs. 
---
TL;DR - You can switch, but I wouldn't recommend it for right now.
---
Costco pumpkin pie is pretty legitimate.
---
At least until the end of Naxx progression, no. If Classic+ is the direction Blizzard takes, and they want to start redesigning things, then that's fine. But I want a Vanilla time capsule at least up until the end of original Vanilla content.
---
I think the debuff limit creates some very interesting choices and interactions within a raid. You need a spot for your curses, sunder armor, annihilator, nightfall, etc. At what point do you drop curse of weakness? Can your healers handle that?
---
The first change to look at if any changes ever happen, which again I don't think should happen until after Naxx, should be leader of the pack and moonkin aura going raidwide instead of partywide. This would lead raids to bring 1 moonkin and 1 feral druid, like they bring 1 shadow priest, giving a bit of legitimacy to specs completely written off without throwing the game into chaos.
---
Yeah, arms does alright Dps, hopefully your guild isn't full of spergs who will freak out about the debuff. 2H fury does well also if you're horde.
---
My first time in Moonglade, Horde. Moonglade is kinda seen as for both night elves and Tauren. Wowhead describes it as "a haven for all druids. It is an uncorrupted neutral zone, protected by mountains and shrouded in green light, without any hostile mobs or gathering resources" so it's very much a leave-each-other-alone-zone. Night elf killed me.
---
Quoted for truth.
---
He responded to my comment like 25-30mins after I posted it, so even that wouldn't matter. Guy was just so desperate to have a "gotcha" moment he made one up.
---
Oof. Stay safe my friend.
---
Have you tried the queue method? Its really painful to do, I cant imagine most folks would ever do it. Your swing timer changes when you parry, so you would have to have amazing reaction speed to pull it off.
---
I play Horde on Westfall, and it's ok. Couple of guilds doing alright. 
---
Made an ally toon there and the difference is night and day. Super active everywhere. 
---
I wish this server was more balanced but what can I do?
---
You’re ally so I can’t tell if serious or not, if serious then gO bAcK tO gOlDsHiRe
---
That's actually the Martyrdom proc, checkmate mages.
---
By the time your max rank greater heal goes off someone else will already have healed with little heals.
---
Most of your heals are going to be healing people from 75% to 100%. And you'll have a good number of other healers all trying to do the same heals.
---
Is anyone having issues with thier game crashing after 2 min of logging in? Played for the last two weeks with no issues. Logged out last night with no issues. This morning the game keeps crashing my computer. Disabled all add-ons too.
---
So seems like the market was working as intended no?
---
Thank you for your deep and elaborate feedback. I hope I will do better next time.
---
Yeah once you hit a certain stage, gold becomes rather pointless. It won't give you those BOP drops you need, or PVP rep etc.. Sure you can buy a mount and some patterns or a bit of gear, but eventually the things you need are locked behind BOP so you need to play to get them. (well except buying runs I suppose.)
---
Nonsense, seeing as my remark applies for the best guilds in the world you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Well, it depends on how you look at it I guess. It's not a completely victimless crime, though. Gold sellers get their gold a number of ways, including their customers' compromised accounts that they logged after you click around their website. That customer will also be banned for manipulation of the in-game economy. This is Blizz-speak for botting and gold selling and does not apply to auction house tycoons. So that player who buys gold has their account "hacked" (it isn't really hacked, it's keylogged) and to rub salt in the wound gets permabanned by Blizzard. Some are able to appeal, most can't.
---
I don't see much of a moral issue here, any more than I see people torrenting a movie now and then. Gold sellers don't "hack" accounts of completely unsuspecting random players, they utilize spyware embedded in dodgy emails and their websites. Meaning they largely victimize people who already bought gold.
---
I just don't think it's a very smart thing to do unless you take safety measures, remove spyware/viruses, and change passwords. I'm also not overly fond of the pay2win model and think that people who don't have the time or for whatever other reason *can't* play the game as intended are probably playing the wrong game and should unsubscribe and spend their money on something they have time for.
---
Who gives a toss, it’s not like the game has a RRP for each item, sell whatever you want for whatever you want.
---
1. Corruption shadowbolt shadowbolt shadowbolt shadowburn (or drain soul if I need shards). If you're not getting heals when you lifestap, only lifetap til health and life are equal, then drink and eat simultaneously til you're back to full mana.
---
2. Cast assigned curse (usually Curse of Elements or Curse of Shadow) corruption shadowbolt shadowbolt shadowbolt shadowbolt shadowbolt lifetap corruption shadowbolt etc. Drink a major mana pot as soon as you can, and use a Dark Rune when you need mana again. If the fight is going on forever, you need to lifetap more frequently and use healthstone/bandages if healers can't spare the mana/attention.
---
Never cast immolate on a raid boss. Raid bosses only have 16 debuff slots, and immolate isn't a strong enough debuff to warrant a debuff slot. In some situations (like if the raid has more than 3-4 warlocks), you can't even cast corruption. 
---
I bring 10 major mana pots and 10 superior mana pots, plus a stack of Dark Runes to MC. I don't use everything, I usually only go through ~5 major mana and ~5 superior mana potions. Use the major mana on boss fights that depend on your classes dps. Use the superior mana pots for everything else.
---
Will the new expansion won’t fix retail wow.
---
Change my mind.
---
No, it's not.  On this subreddit there's a bunch of people who hate retail to such an extent that they will circle jerk among themselves and downvote anyone who like retail.  It's always been that way.  You guys are like the Boomers of the gaming world, and it's pretty sad.
---
and?
---
Scholo should be an exception. It seems like more bosses in that dungeon have aggro resets than don't. 4 dps + heals would probably be easier than bringing a prot pally there.
---
Hey, you say whatever you want to whoever you want. I for one feel that it's fucking stupid to say LOL or pepega or 4head out loud instead of communicating with real words or laughter, but that's just me. Maybe I'm just an old grumpy bastard.
---
It's not the joke, the joke is that he didnt take a screen shot on the computer, he also didnt take a picture with his phone, he took a picture of a picture with his phone, I didnt miss the joke but apparently you did, instead of telling him he could of taken a screenshot on the computer I went one step below what he did, playing off his joke, but you didnt get that, and that's ok dude
---
But this is only possible cause mc is so easy right? In harder content they will have to be more efficient or will it always be this easy?
---
Since you're horde...
---
Start thinking about pre raid gear options (not just best in slot, but 2nd/3rd/4th best in slot are sometimes just a little worse and way easier to grind). 
---
Have you done Hinterlands? There's a trinket that gives +20ap and +1% hit that is fucking fantastic for warriors. Shit ton of quests and not much of an alliance presence since Blizz didn't give them many quests for the zone. Probably my favorite zone in the game if horde.
---
Searing Gorge has a decent number of quests and they're all nice and tight in one spot.
---
Blasted Lands has a handful of quests that are worth doing if the zone isn't busy. There were too many people every time I checked on my server though for it to be worth doing.
---
Felwood is....okay...lots of running back and forth but worth doing some quests on your way to Winterspring (you'll want to be 55-56+ before Winterspring though).
---
WPL is good around level 54+. Argent Dawn rep will be handy eventually.
---
EPL is great at 56+. The Tirion questline is a must for the neck reward at the end. Both plagueland zones are full of lore and lead-in quests for Scholo/Strat.
---
Winterspring as mentioned earlier has a good amount of high level quests.
---
Instance-wise, I'd only bother with Sunken Temple if you have a handful of quests.
---
BRD has a ton of quests and a couple best in slot items worth hunting down. Get your MC attunement done.
---
Running LBRS/UBRS/Scholo/Strat/DM once you're at the appropriate level is great for leveling and knocking out pre raid bis and attunement.
---
Something to keep in mind is this will be the last week before the honor system is implemented. AKA--there will be a reward for killing you so you might want to do as much questing in the open world as you can.
---
I wouldn't think so.
---
More gear being released just means people have more money &amp; less need for these BoE Epics.
---
For spellcleave, you are there to gather the adds, not hold aggro, the mages should rotate CC and nobody should take damage after the initial gathering of mobs.
---
First off, it's against the rules of the game so violating those rules is cheating.  Cheating is unethical.  
---
Also, I'm glad I don't have the temptation to buy gold, because I might if it wasn't potentially going to get me banned (if it wasn't against the rules).  I'm glad that blizz cracks down on gold buying, because I don't want that dynamic in the game.  Have you ever played a micro-transaction game where you came across players who must have spent hundreds or thousands of real dollars on it?  I'm convinced that at least a significant portion of these are people who stole credit card credentials.  
---
As others are saying here, gold farmers usually don't come by their gold in honest ways either.  They hack accounts, steal the gold and items, vendor all the gear, then send it off to be sold.
---
They kept their feet on the ground!
---
Yeah, I need my carrot on a stick, Frank
---
It's cool I'll give him a quick crash course right now: 
---
1. See enemy player
---
2. stealth and move somewhere he wont think to look for you
---
3. wait until he decides you've left the area and goes back to trying to kill things
---
4. As soon as he pulls something start murdering him
---
5. rinse and repeat as often as necessary
---
Stereotypes of a warlock misunderstood...but it's still all good
---
I finally just gave up and decided I was happy enough with tooth of gnarr.
---
"If i want to PVP i'll join a BG when they come out"
---
Then population balance is meaningless, BGs will be cross realm
---
Personally I stay in battle stance for the most part when questing.  The extra damage you take from berserker stance is a little high for me.
---
There are a few key skills in berserker stance though that are quite useful. Intercept, whirlwind, berserker rage, pummel. 
---
Assuming you have tactical mastery I'd get some macros for those skills which switches to berserker stance and casts them instantly. Then switch back to battle stance manually.  They are all kind of situational skills (except berserker rage which I tend to use all the time solo questing) - but very handy to get to quickly.
---
Tanking I'd mostly use defensive stance, except again a quick switch to berserker for whirlwind on bigger packs, and battle stance for overpower if I remember in time.
---
I've never actually dps'd in a dungeon but I'd probably use berserker stance mainly since I'd not be taking any damage.
---
That's my thoughts anyway but I'm far from a pro.
---
We created brand new characters together at the start of the weekend. One guy had never played WoW before and it had been years since the others had. Oh yeah, we were bad for sure! But it was fun and nostalgic nonetheless.
---
Such a distinctive style.
---
Yes it’s cumulative. So if you clear all the pets training, and train like Bite 6 and it’s 75 training points, it will take the full 75 and automatically train 1, 2, 3, etc. My pet is level 47 and I just did this last night. Once I cleared I had like 200 or 300 training points to use, can’t remember exactly. Growl is free.
---
Everybody wants a get-rich-quick scheme.  The cold hard truth is that, no matter which avenue you take, you're gonna have to work at it.
---
The only way gold just falls into your lap without effort is if you get a lucky world drop.
---
In what way is it broken?
---
If you click willy nilly, maybe.  I'm not sure why you think it would be a waste of rage to avoid clicking two buttons in favor of one.  You do have to keep track of your rage and what stance you're in, and make good choices.
---
Phase 2+. Is damn near mostly group pvp.
---
You gotta clench your teeth and add em to a kos list if they catch you out alone though, and that kind of sucks.
---
Yes on condition that all monsters health was increased to balance the change out.
---
only .3% of the entire population of RANKED players can have rank14. That means the more people who rank, even if its just the 35 kills or whatever to get to rank1, increases the total # of ranked players and therefore more rank 14s. This was buffed from .1% in a patch at some point, but we are going to get the .3% i believe
---
As a first time wow player that’s about level 42 rogue I’m having so much more fun after respecing to subtlety. I felt like combat was jus a bunch of stat boosts but after swapping I just have so much more fun during combat, even if my dps is way lower.
---
Hahahah this is so great.
---
In my first read, my eyes saw "take one out to shoot peasants" and wondered to myself when did the ancaps take over.
---
Tell your tank to keep building aggro during P2.  This stuff isn't hard.  We were doing it 15 years ago.
---
Actually just watched a video on Starshards build and it seems useful with the 6 second cast and mana regen.
---
lol major bag fail. 
---
L2P or delete your toon bro.
---
your the guy that used noobtube in cod wernt you?
---
lolfailzord
---
I do not have any actual numbers, but there is no icd. I've had it proc 5 times in about 8 seconds. I've noticed that it seems to double proc (2x back to back) more often than not. I've had entire mc boss fights with just 1-2 procs.

But I've also had a 2 minute rag fight with 14 procs. I looked at energy generated vs the other 3 rogues. They were all between 180-300 bc of thistle tea and relentless strikes. I think I was around 700, also with thistle and rs. It was the first time I tried it on a parse, though. I did much better than the week before when I was wearing the prebis gear. I could see you getting unlucky and not getting many procs though. However, several of our mc boss kills are &lt;40s now. With a few lucky procs, esp as combat daggers, I think this would be the ticket to record breaking parses. Lucky procs on this and wf and you could feasibly break 1600 dps on a fight like magmadar or gehennas with perd/ distracting or sunrazor. I think a 1.3 dagger might be a better oh than cht for these ultra short 30s fights where an extra proc or two can mean a 300+dps swing.
---
Yup gear in Classic doesn't make you good. Just means you play a lot. Bunch of shitty priests out there with benediction still spamming flash heal. lol
---
I just thought it was a dps warrior.
---
A lot of the rogues that follow the list I assume you are wearing on your warrior (truestrike/forsake/devil/2 hit rings/hit bow etc.) The staple private server list (cause their hit rating was different) don't understand that you only really need the 9% hit chance for your special attacks. while yes our Auto attacks make up for more damage on average, having 17&amp; hit chance to maybe have a few less glancing or what have you doesn't make as much of a difference as getting more agi/str/crit/ap etc.  
---
Rogues get 5% hit rating from precision, and then weapon expertise gives 5 weapon skill (I think it's 2.5% hit rating) So that puts us at 7.5% from talents. only need to get 2% more from anywhere else which is pretty easy with tarnished elven rings being out now. That means more agi/str on other pieces of gear (truestrike/forsaken/devilsaur all which have no agi/str and only flat stats). Which means kings scales the stats on your gear whereas if it were AP it wouldn't scale.   
---
People are so quick to follow lists though without doing any research and forget basics of the game. Crit &gt; Hit once you get 9% as a rogue. And agi getting amp'd by kings means more crit/ap. It's just common sense at the end of the day.
---
Mindtap Talisman,  down to just that in non-raid.  I would like 2 of em cause I havent seen the ony trinket either but after 30 runs of the horrible DMW I now just try to do one run a day with hope I might get lucky.
---
Go away concern trolling.
---
And Titanic is just a Hallmark movie with a big budget, I too can easily throw shade on things I don't like as well. He's gatekeeping "cinema" by saying that having a product that was tested before it was released meant it felt "wrong to him"
---
armor is best stat, then agi for crit, hit and dodge, then Hit if you can get it, then Stam, then defense.
---
Defense is OK, but we only benefit from some of it (since we can't block we dont get as much out of it as a warrior, its nice to have for sure, but not at the cost of armor or agi)
---
armor is key, any point of armor is effectively quadrupled in dire bear form, so gear like Tooga's Ring from that turtle escort in tanaris is a mighty asset.
---
I wish i could sugercoat it, but dwarf is the way to go
---
If I want to level as a prot warrior, should I go with two-handed like whirlwind axe or stick with sword and board? I feel like more dps is more threat but shield block, slam, and bash are all so good.
---
yea that is how i find groups now too. Just go to the dungeon and ask in general for a group or the super old school method has been surprisingly successful as well. type /who warrior 58-60 and message everyone in that list "Hey want to tank &lt;insert dungeon&gt;". Once that is successful you start spamming and whispering healers. DPS will fill fast no matter where you are going so whisper tanks then healers.
---
Its not hard to do at all. My swing timer bar has my parry right above it. Regardless, you get far less out of that much hit from your offhand than you would from the crit replacing it.
---
so fight back, join a guild, become good at pvp... 
---
it just amazes me that people rolled on pvp servers and then complain about pvp existing.
---
Just you.
---
Alright. Thanks for your insights, might give this a shot!
---
That's how it was born
---
Last weeks before bwl? Bwl won’t be out for months.
---
&gt; last weeks before BWL
---
uhh wut?
---
yesterday a warrior in my guild with viskag just dkped predblade for his oh weapon. even after i talked to the gm about how corehound tooth is like 10times better as an oh.
---
predblade is just, so long bis for rogues it's actually sad seeing it getting rolled as an OH for a fury warrior. 
---
i know its an upgrade and all, but shit made me salty and still grinds my gear.
---
i am new to the guild, but i swear to god, even if i didnt even had a chance to get it, it makes me sick to my stomache that not another rogue got it.
---
He's an Ole Miss fan, they're not known for their smarts. Hail State!
---
Just got to 240 Gnome Engineering, should I be making all of the Gadgets and then switch to Goblin for PvP?
---
I'm maining a 0/30/21 hybrid....i can do everything, but no one loves me as much as a warrior or a priest.  I feel this post so much rn...
---
58-60 isn't a huge difference.
---
I would rather be a main raider in a small guild than be a material bot for stronger players. It’s really up to you though and what you would be happy with. If you do get to raid with a bigger guild after being on their bench you’ll be essentially a carry which isn’t my jam.
---
Holy shit
---
First off, we don't know if we're THAT close to BWL. You could still get a whole month and a half to 3 months of rag/ony clears before we see razorgore.
---
Second, I think you should do what you would more enjoy. If you like your guild, stay. If you don't, look for greener pastures. But I would not suggest leaving a place you enjoy for a place that is a bit faster at doing content that has an end to it in the first place. It doesn't matter how slow you are at WoW Classic. There isn't going to be a new patch that completely wipes out the last one. You need MC gear foer BWL, and you need BWL gear for AQ. Everything will always be relevant.
---
Prices fluctuate in every market, if you think it's too low then the last thing you should be doing is bitching about the amazing bargain you're getting. 
---
It's honestly kinda hilarious how all these self proclaimed ah wizards seemingly don't understand literally the first fucking part of playing markets: buy low
---
You can do a similar thing with just the base client. Right click on a persons name you’re whispering with and there should be an option to move that individual conversation to a separate window.
---
I totally forgot about Uther's Strength, Is that worth it? How much does the shield absorb for?
---

---
Again, depends upon the realm. I chose arcanite reaper which on average has less than 5 percent of the active players of Herod. That is why the range is 10-18. There are literally never more than 30 of any given class at 60 on arcanite reaper - even in prime time.
---
*blinks behind you*
---
NANI?!
---
What class are you? I'd suggest checking out the discord for whatever class you play. They will always have a ton of resources. Simple google for "(insert class) discord classic wow"
---
Can confirm, two mages in DM:N is easy mode.
---
You are underestimating how much people want to procrastinate lmao, someone will watch anything
---
Phase 2 is just world bosses and HKs.
---
BWL is Phase 3 and won’t be out till well after Xmas.
---
This game is a fun game. Your current guild will be clearing Mc and Ony this week. No guilds are further ahead! Also, why the hell would you want to farm stuff for others to have fun?!?
---
Am I missing something?!?
---
I've done pure prot for 35 levels and since I play with a fire mage it's easy leveling.
---
How do you not die using two handed? My healers go oom already sometimes.
---
It is when you are fighting lvl 62 elites. Not being able to hit them = no threat.
---
Roll need if you need.
---
The only things that are questionable or controversial are: 
---
Rolling need on BoE blues/epics.   
---
Rolling need on cloth blues if you are a leather/mail wearer and there are clothes in the group.  
---
Rolling need for off-spec items. 
---
They may cause tensions with some, but are fine with others.. 
---
But generally just roll need, if you aren't totally sure then ask the group
---
Thats correct. You can usually make the boe gno.ish trinkets and sell them on AH for a decent profit too.
---
It isnt 1% but 0,1% over all classic.
---
Yeah there will always be people with better gear but who cares, getting the rank 14 only means you've wasted 3 month x 12 or more hours camping honor.
---
thanks, so you press the key and it activates on the next creature you hover over or do you already have to be hovering when you press the key?
---
People pulling aggro when it looks like they shouldn’t in phase 1? Or 3?
---
This is the best advice here, people are arguing over whether someone should have rolled or not and all the rest of it but the bottom line is that the game is not a sprint it's a marathon. Yeah it's nice to be some of the first people to grab super rare gear and all that but you can't get down when it drops and you lose it to someone else, even if that someone else really didn't "need" it. If your guild refuses to take you to MC because you are missing that trinket it may be time to find a new guild that isn't as restrictive.
---
Also if it makes OP feel any better there are rogues and warriors probably going on their 150th Anger/Arena run and still walking out with no HoJ or Epic Chest (don't know the name). I've done upwards of 30 for HoJ and haven't even seen the darn thing drop let alone get to lose the roll to a Ret Pally on it.
---
Blood Elves couldn't be Warriors at first, it kinda made sense until Blizz caved and changed it.
---
Also, might be worth revisiting as t 0.5 4pc bonus later on.
---
.... It alerts you whenever an enemy stealths within 20 yards or so of you. Lol.
---
Kudos!
---
There is no reason to have goblin for pvp on both if he can make the bombs on one char and send them over.
---
Locks will fuck you, so I just run. But you can ice block dots and burst and pray, but it’s a hard battle.
---
For hunters, sheep pet, blink into their dead zone (it’s like 8 meters) and nova them.  If you’re in dead zone and you can nova, you can frostbolt + fire blast their helpless ass, and when nova breaks you Cone of Cold and follow them in dead zone and either scorch / frostbolt if you think you can get away with it, or spam arcane explosion.  Cone of Cold on cool down ALWAYS against hunter
---
Against rogue, you must ice block their kidney or their burst and avoid damage, then kite.  If you can get a sheep off, wait out the nova cooldown and reapply ice barrier and open up with a max rank FIREBALL because the dot breaks vanish.  And kite.  And kite.  If the rogue lands a kidney and you don’t have ice block, you are dead.
---
I don’t know how to fight Shaman because I’m Horde.  But Paladins are annoying with all the cleanses and BOF, so I just try to block the BOF and hopefully land a CS on their holy school and then burst down.
---
Good priests are tough too, just kill them ASAP and lock their holy school so they can’t heal.
---
If you have any other questions, just ask!
---
Exactly it's an opinion so why can't I have my own?  I play a priest, shadow in pve and world pvp disc in bgs when they come out. Some people think it's boring I enjoy it.
---
You forgot to add /cast curse of elements before the soulfire
---
A large part of my job involves sitting there on standby waiting for a call to come in with request. If nothing comes in, I can't just leave but there isn't much else to be done.
---
Do you need to clear within an hour for it to drop?
---
It took me 5 weeks of full MC clears before I got my first piece of raid gear (ring of spell power). There’s 7 mages on the main roster, plus ~4 locks that want some of the same gear too
---
Just pick a random pvp realm, as a horde its gonna be a faceroll anyway.
---
Just farm your class DM quest trinket or the 11mp5 one and ignore the second wind drop.
---
    #showtooltip Charge
---
    /cast Charge
---
I just copied that from the Fight Club discord.  All of my skills are macro'd in this style.  It is ONE button press to use this to Charge, regardless of what stance you are in.  It's not like the old days where one press changed stances and then another did the Charge.  One press.
---
It’s hard for me to say personally. My guess is that it might have just been harder cause the tank was much lower level. Google said the BFD range is lvl24-32, so the warrior was just at min level. He possibly could’ve had worse gear that made it harder to keep him up?
---
See I was told otherwise, I don't use the addon. Thanks for the update

Not sure if it was recently updated, but even if it wasn't,  this should only be about a month old.

I always shakle the ranged ones in strat/scholo if the tank can't LoS it.

Dudeo even when I first played vanilla I missed AQ40 (more of a bc boy). If you're having fun have fun. It's not like leveling becomes impossible, PvP is just going to be more prevalent (and for the first few weeks... Uh... Maybe it'll be as bad as you think for that time) but so so so many people are behind.
---
Most of my social group played more vanilla than I did. I'm level 47 and the highest amongst people I know. You are so far ahead of the curve yo, you're just comparing yourself to those ahead.
---
Shrug, means they don't like action adventure magic sci fi, and they are trying to frame that dislike in the terms they use to judge their films and their direct compatriots films.
---
Thanks! Thats what I will do.
---
No but I don't think it matters, this is standard operating procedure for all rogues regardless of faction. Maybe I shouldn't give the guide away to a potential enemy but like druids we rogues have a code...teach other rogues how to rogue better and then kill them mercilessly so they learn it by seeing you do it to them.
---
Go prot, find 3 leveling mages and a healer. Run LBRS and kill all the trash up until the ogres then reset.
---
Level as arms.
---
Over populated servers sound nice in theory but a slightly quieter server makes for easier questing/profession ect ect and quieter doesn’t mean dead, I’m on a med high pop server and I’ve been enjoying it

---
I can't seem to get AOE farming down. How do you do it? I almost die every time. I try to wand - blizzard - frost nova - blink - blizzard but it feels like blizzard doesn't hit strongly enough for me and they catch up too fast.
---
Most of the good ones are BoE, yes, but you'll have to pay an upcharge for them, so not sure if that's worth it in the long run. It's relatively cheap to re-start engineering and quickly get back to 240 (or it was a week ago, before they announced Phase 2, I'm not sure what prices are at now). 
---
There are some Goblin recipes that are BOP, but not sure how great they are. The Goblin Dragon Gun and the Goblin Bomb Dispenser are both BOP, but those are the only two I see as well.

Yeah, I think I misunderstood the original question. I was treating it as both or nothing, rather than mix and match.
---
But it is **a** reaction. Which is all they want. 
---
It's their way of "asserting" power over you. They get a rise out of you and tell themselves, "I have power over this person! I can make them dance to my puppet strings!"
---
Look at the prices of shards on your server. Of ypu get enchanting you can run dungeons and DE blues for a really good profit most of the time. You dont even need to enchant anything.
---
People that say alchemy is a good money maker are half right. IF you have herbalism and IF you spend 500+ gold for the useful recipes then you can make decent money. Alchemy without herbalism is pointless.
---
They're on the spectrum.
---
I'm a priest, never enjoyed the mage in 15 years I leveled one and never played it after lvl 86. I've tried multiple times, I just see more friends on mages reroll, because it's not what they expected
---
&gt; If Classic stays as is then so be it, but of they add more content such as behind 60, there will be a time when no one runs MC again unless the rare guild who tried but has no clue what they are doing and never figures it out.
---
You can't compare a new extention to classic's phases that's plain wrong. 
---
You'll always need to run MC / BWL to gear up people's alt etc
---
 (And let's be honest most fights in MC are over in less than a minute this raid is terrible so not running it isn't the end of the world).
---
So then you're just looking for bar clutter in all stances?
---
Paging bars with similar functionality occupying the same hotkey slot is far more efficient and allows you to have 100% control over your stance dancing, which is a core aspect of the class.
---
There are so many flavors of crutches warriors are relying on these days with macros, and my advice to you is pretty simple: practice and learn your class. Much like no professional racers drive automatic cars, good warriors don't rely on that sort of macro.

wowhead is dumb for having both itemization sets still on their site, Classic is using updated 1.12.1 itemized sets (req lvl60 blue ones vs older itemization 58lvl req different stats/bonuses) and those items are in phase 2 with honor-rank rewards.
---
54-58 I did nothing but tank BRD, there a lot of prebis there. I got everything I wanted but sgc. At 58 I switched to lbrs and did that till 60

I didn’t disagree. But any reaction is what they want.

I stopped at rank 11, was in it mostly for the cheap epic mount, the rest of my group (3 locks and druid) continued on and eventually all of them rotated to rank 14, they were very dedicated...

How valuable is Serathil? (1H Axe with 40dps +8str +90 armour)
---
I had seen it on a Orc Warrior Pre-BiS list, so when someone offered me it for 45g yesterday I pulled the trigger. I checked the auction house but there weren't any being sold.
---
My guild told me the value was closer to 100g, but is this a situation where the item isn't very often sold and the price is skewed upwards? Or did I get a really good deal on this weapon.
---
I know prices fluctuate based on servers, I play on Biggelsworth so high pop servers should be a good reference point.
---
Sounds like you never ran high M+ keys. Having a perfect (literally) interrupt rotation is the difference between chesting and depleting.
---
Announcing interrupt isn't saying "I'm so good I can interrupt". It's so other players don't use their interrupt at the same time so they can save it for other casts.
---
You really sound like the noob here.

Gouge can't stop things that can't be stunned. Not sure how many bosses in classic are kickable, but I remember that call-out being useful when organizing pugs in Kara, for example

So the guys at Fight Club discord aren't good warriors?  I don't see any particular reason we can't have a civil discussion instead of all these personal attacks you're slinging my way.

You can certainly have your own opinion! I was just pushing back on some of the logic you offered in support of your opinion. Bad logic, not a bad opinion.

One of my Officers is the most helpful guy ever.  He’ll log off of his alt and do a dungeon he doesn’t need just to help out.  He plays a Druid and will play any role to help the team.  And when he needs something, you bet your ass people help him.  In fact, I am going to help him level his warlock tonight, and I expect to get exactly nothing out of it.  Except for fun with my bro and good karma with a person who has helped more times than I can count.
---
If you aren’t getting help, it’s probably because you aren’t being helpful and/or friendly.  Take a look into the mirror buddy.

that's more than I've ever seen I think
---
Dumb mages who burn through their mana pool and then drink to full don't use wands.
---
And totally inaccurate. Anyone who thinks shadow is on the same level as boomkin is objectively unintelligent. We hit cap easier than any other caster, only needing 6% from gear. In a raid setting, our shadow damage gets a total modifier of over 80% between shadowform, darkness, shadow weaving, and imp shadow bolt. We have two, and only two, real weaknesses:
---
1. No built-in mana regen. We don’t have mana gems, we don’t have life tap. However, proper gearing and use of potions/runes make up for this (ex: in full p6 bis gear, a spriest will have about 45 mp/5. Over a 4 minute encounter, that will regenerate just about 2000 mana).
---
2. We do not scale with crit, at least not very much. It’s true, we can’t get insane high-roll parses like mages and locks can with a lucky string of crits. We do, however, get the benefit of being able to almost entirely disregard crit (and hit once we get our easily-attainable cap) and gear purely for max spellpower and mp/5. What we lack in high rolls, we gain in consistency.
---
Only the town is, where the guards are. Otherwise it's as PvP as any other zone.
---

The best part is since you're a druid he's going to be all the more confused that he ended up drowned. Would be a lot more obvious with a priest.  I wouldn't even be mad.

Sorry I can't hear about your rejuvs, too busy tanking MC
---
Mobs usually die in one taunt + a few sec, there is also cc so if you play correctly it shouldn't be much of a problem.
---
BiS tracker addon
---
Yeah, I am not saying you can't do it.  I am saying your aggro range makes it so the people spamming arena can't skip the same mob groups they would usually.  That means you get invited less as a dps (or it did for me).  Healers likely get a pass, and people will gladly clear the extra mobs to get going faster and not have to wait on a higher level heal.
---
None of them legitimate. You don't need to see your targets target if they're attacking you, because you can see that. You also don't need to see it if they aren't attacking you... because you can see that too.
---
I've played since classic, raided at a high level in all expansions playing all roles, and have never needed it for anything.
---
I'm a ret main so that was part of the joke xD
---
You feel like the person that doesn’t know other classes but expects them to be gods either way. Gouge is 45 energy, the highest energy ability rogues have outside of backstab. Cast usually take about 1.5-2 seconds, which is about the same as the 20 energy tics. So unless they had 25 energy floating before the mob starts casting (assuming kick is in CD), they won’t be able to gouge. The flip side is asking a rogue to always conserve energy for gouge, which is unrealistic and honestly quite demanding. Yet you are expecting them to constantly be on the look out for this all the time??
---
It's always been a (human) face in profile.. what did you think it was until now?
---
Surprised they didn't just log off.
---
I don't think it would be good for the game for something like that to have been the way to go, but I would love the chance to play Classic with some of the class tuning of BC (and the debuff limit removed).
---
BWL is not phase 2 though
---
;)
---
Personally fury warrior, it is quite literally auto attack the class.
---
They're only doing it because streamers are doing it. A lot of them don't know why they're doing it, why it was created, or why for the content right now it's actually not superior for 95% or more of players.
---
I've tried fury/prot, my old guild wanted me to make the switch, but after trying it out and doing some research, at this stage of the game it not only doesn't bring much benefit, but it also has a lot of downsides, so I switched back to prot and I've had absolutely no problems with it.
---
I stand corrected. Still uses it about as often as Warriors in WoW do lol.
---
You move along the edges of the room in that case. Helps mitigate the larger aggro range.  
---
The 50 healer will likely need consumables, as well. Totally doable, though.
---
I'm a Druid Feral Tank that just hit 60 and I honestly have people trying to snatch me up to tank to whatever run they're about to do. I don't know if the tank economy is that lacking or if I'm just competent, but I think it may be because I'm a Tauren named Stinky.
---
LOL, if your tank is surrounded by multiple mobs you cannot just “use your eyes”. The seconds it takes for you to figure out what exact mob the tank is targeting could mean life and death, good run or bad run etc
---
What a silly explanation and excuse...
---
There is a reason why every player average or above use this function in the game.

Some people are anti social ass holes. And that’s that

Yeah we can't have big battles in classic because they are hosting the servers on virtual machines in the cloud to maximize profit.

On some of the more populated servers there is what’s called the devilsaur mafia.  It’s a group of players from each faction completely controlling the devilsaur market.  If you try to farm them while they’re around their partners from the opposite faction kill you. Repeatedly

They take turns between them killing and skinning.

Hi, /u/CelicaFireMage

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ds2hix/how_to_fury_tank_and_furyprot_build/).

Real talk, that's not going to happen unless you both are prepared to no-life it.  If you are, then dungeon runs over and over and over.  Full BRD runs until 55-56, then move to Strat/Scholo/BRS.  He should be able to handle those as a healer as long as the tank is decently geared.  His low level won't be too much of a concern for pulling extra stuff since you want to kill everything anyway for the XP.  
---
Best to find a tank dedicated to this effort as well, so you can just cycle in DPS as needed.
---
Here's another one:

Imagine being the leader of the fucking Kirin Tor and people mistake you for a random dwarf
---
I can't possibly know since I was unable to play at that point, but I did it pretty damn early and it definitely wasn't wipe7daysoneveryboss-hard.
---
When I deny the request to group I try to say something too.  That's a good &amp; nice move.
---
Are you tanking raids or dungeones? there is a huge difference
---
Bookmarked. Thx!
---
It scans all LFG channels and gives you dungeon groups in a list you can filter for dungeons you're interested in. Also adds notifications if you enable it.
---
I did give feedback that what my comment was. I think you need take your own advice ya sad fuck. Lmao
---
I'm 51 on my tank and have yet to find a rogue who saps.
---
Ideally rogue would sap, id charge in and use demo roar to grab aggro then pull back a little.
---
Instead I just get rogues that decide to run in and aggro and start SSing while the healer is oom and drinking
---
I think it depends on how you plan on pvping. If you are doing a lot of world pvp then survivability and mass dots are your best bet. If you are more into the ganking/2v2 route then bursty dps with a healer is ideal. I wouldn't worry too much about gear as mechanics are much more important in pvp.
---
I wouldn't call that a dick move on your part, but a dick move on their part. Good work.
---
Always the Mages fault 😂🤣
---
Given what we know right now, we can expect Phase 3 to arrive in about three months. But Dire Maul launched midway through Phase 1, it's certainly possibly that BWL will follow that model. And even if it doesn't, there are three major holidays during this period where it's possible raids won't fire -- especially in a smaller guild.
---
Then there is having to ask for arcane intellect when there are 2 mages in the group
---
You can argue that there is a market for each expansion. So it's not a good argument
---
Yes, spanish version of huehue. Also, spanish version of:

hahaha

kkkkk

etc.

Every language has his own written laughter.
---
Rune of the guard captain if melee.
---
I guess so, I started at 51 as a DPS and never really had issues finding a group
---
feet of the lynx
---
&gt; Why did you rend?
---
If a tank is using rend past deadmines you probably have bigger issues.
---
Correct. Pair that with the fact that split rolls being awarded in alphabetical order seems like a stupid way to handle it. Its most likely just a non-shown re-roll that happens between the players.
---
Anyhow, I'll make sure to take note of any future re-rolls, if just so I can prove his statement false.
---
666G and I am struggling to get my 1st mount lol
---
Because I'm not trying to share loot and at the same time im grinding and your taking exp. And I'm not doing anything that requires help
---
spyglass is one of those addons I think should be banned
---
Instantly pissed
---
It certainly won't sell for double. You made out. It'd take months of dedicated logging in to have that investment pay off, but all you had to do was get a drop and click a button.
---
&gt; You're giving up flexibility and control for convenience.
---
I'm giving up nothing of the kind.  I'm giving up one button press.  
---
My setup allows me to hamstring with one button press.  Yours takes two.  We both have to decide "Is it worth it to switch out of whatever stance I'm in to hamstring?  Is it worth the rage loss?  Is it worth possibly taking more damage (if I was in D stance before)?"  Then we make the decision and I press one button and you press two.  No big deal.  Play how you want.  I'd rather press one button.
---
You must play with some really bad druids. Yes, druids get the shaft as "other class gud" at the same roles the druids can fill, but what other class can step in on the fly and fill any of those roles? Saying you hate druids is like saying you hate everyone, because druids can replace anyone.
---
Plus, MotW is always worth the price of entry.
---
Yep. I find it extremely boring. That's kind of how opinions work.
---
I suppose so, but that very same priest happens to top the healing meters. Very likely in part because of the free innervate he gets but anyways.

And this is why no one tanks.

Sometimes if it's a low volume and expensive item I just want to sell it, and I don't have faith that the few listed are at a fair price. I care more about getting my gold for what I can than your market politics
---
Robe of the Archmage isn't replaced until Phase 4, and then it's replaced by another tailored recipe, Bloodvine Vest.  Not until Phase 5 is there a non-tailored upgrade.
---
Need some mage water bud?
---
Nah, if i dont want to study I will do ANYTHING
---
Stay shadow till around 58 then spec into holy/disc. You'll be able to do dungeons fine till 58 as shadow spec. You might want to quest some and shadow is just plain faster when it comes to that.
---
im sure!
---
A bit late with my reply, but this is GREAT!
---
Thanks so much for the tips. I'll try to put them to use.
---
If it’s a kill quest it makes sense but those “loot 10 of this item” quests seem like they take forever as it is let alone competing against someone else in the group. I personally never group up for those ones.
---
RIP the guy that rolled human while the rest of you were NE.
---
Mind Vision:
---
1) I've used it to help find Jed without walking far into ubrs
---
2) I've used it to help guide someone to our group in a dungeon without having to go back and get them. 
---
3) I've used it to find and mark the torch guys in the huge room in BRD. You can jump from target to target while you're currently channeling it, so you can technically use it to explore the entire dungeon if you wanted. 
---
Mind Sooth:
---
1) Good for helping non-60s get by packs we aren't planning to pull)
---
2) Good for stopping the guy at the edge of a pack from aggroing when you pull a nearby pack to the group.
---
I play resto druid and for dungeons I'll take a fury/prot tank over a deep prot tank every day of the week. I'm constantly getting aggro with my healing and there's a lot more healing due to also dps getting aggro. But with fury tanks I'm never seeing this problem. At least that's my experience.
---
Isn’t the pattern unavailable till phase 3?
---
Why would you ever solo tank ubrs? Two tanks makes it super easy.
---
Not sure which is why I asked
---
this is so true lol. the one time i killed over a node i got an arcane crystal so its 100% true 100% of the time for me :P
---
Yeah, there was just no takesy backsy on that cinematic. 
---
Now that it’s come up, I have to wonder if hunters would be the oddballs for dorfs. 
---
“Ah want tae be a hunter Da.” 
---
“Git tha fuck out wi’ that. Yer no son o’ mine. Go outside then wi’ yer stupid furries.”
---
Not really much more complex as you add corruption to a shadowbolt spam lol
---
Now I want to take off my weapons and be a raid boss against 40 lvl sub 10’s
---
Additionally warrior has a few abilities that "mirror" another one in different stance such as taunt and mocking blow or charge and intercept. I've bound those for similar keybinds to easily remember them and also to have faster reaction if the first option doesn't work or is resisted. I have taunt macro (taunt in def stance, def stance otherwise) bound to R, and mocking blow macro bound to shift-R so if I see my taunt resisted I'll just add shift to my R-mashing.
---
Uh yeah, I have a full/nearly full t1 tank for my raid group. full prot is literally worse across the board outside of raid content in terms of rage generation.
---
I'm a level 60 Warlock currently on the last part of my epic mount quest. I want to pay someone who has the mats to summon the dreadsteed but I don't have a ballpark idea of what it should cost to have them help me get my mount. What's the range for the amount of gold I should give someone who has the mats and can help me?
---
The trick is to lifetap often and now down to as low hp as possible. If a loc does it every 10-15 secs it's not an issue
---
And when they left the made the problem worse everywhere, instead of sticking it out and letting things balance out they broke servers.
---
Metadox - The Hero of the Horde
---
Epic! Legendary! Awesome!!!
---
Just uploaded my character, if the addon gets the ability to upload other people I'll def be scanning lots of people. I like contributing to this kinda stuff. I was super into the census addon before it got borked, was running it on two accounts to get counts for both factions.
---
I can see why some get pissed. I've grouped with many warlocks who lifetap to full mana and stand there. Just so they don't waste a pitiful amount of gold on food/water. 
---
People be shitty.
---
I totally agree with this, especially playing at low levels I've usually consumed atleast 1 marijuana and am watching Netflix.  I don't wanna group with someone and then afk for 5 minutes because I decided I needed to go make popcorn.
---
Starsharts is horrible because it has a compounding damage effect like curse of agony does. So the initial dot does less dmg than the end dot. This means of yoi get attacked or spell push back you'll lose out on the highest dmg tick of it.
---
Also it takes up a debuff slot.
---
I'm not railing on NE but starsharts is a fucing terrible spell.
---
Cimer Miette Putain !
---
I'm aware of how the game works and that a level difference can be negated. You are splitting hairs to make a point. As far as the 2 hour search goes, I don't believe you at all. I've seen this moronic claim parroted 50 times on reddit by casuals circlejerking each other and I don't believe you for a second that an intact ubrs group spent 120 minutes looking for a tank while you saw them advertise. Just accept that people can choose not to bring sub60s and that they have a perfectly understandable reason for it.
---
Yeah lol I wanna see it when its like 600+ in BWL gear
---
Hinterlands has more than 4 quests. It is worth the time to go there especially if you can herb or mine in skulk rock for ghost mushrooms
---
Is this against tos? I'm curious if blizzard would do something for this type of behavior. It's such a dickhead move.
---
I have both an ally and a horde toon on Westfall and, while I enjoy both, the ally side is definitely much more active/populated.  It definitely keep things interesting, but can also get annoying when there's a gaggle of idiots yelling nonsense in general chats for extended periods of time.  Overall, recommended.
---
Threat? I didn't say anything about threat. It has everything to do with rage. If you go deep prot when you're in decent gear you don't get nearly as much rage as the fury/prot build.
---
Best meme I've seen all day. I love this meme with the cat. Plus I hate cats.
---
Imagine being the guy who doesn't get the point of six friends having fun together. It sure would be pathetic to be that guy.
---
~75-100g is what I've seen warlocks on my server offering it for.  I'm not sure if they ever got any buyers, but theres a ballpark for ya.
---
And if you're survival, Wyvern Sting will give you even more utility at 40.
---
I honestly wouldn't go too crazy about BIS for preraid. It's something to work towards but many other blues are close runners up / suffice just fine.

Shut down Wow
---
Go to your World Of warcraft folder then \_Classic\_ -&gt; WTF -&gt; Account -&gt; There's a folder with some numbers here(this is your account name but covered up) go on that one, now there's  a folder called SavedVariables, you inside there, and you will see some LUA+BAK files of all your addons. Delete the ones for the addon, now go back , and to be sure, go under your realmname folder -&gt; Character name folder -&gt; SavedVariables, and delete for the addon again if there's any files with the addons name. This is the character specific settings.
---
Open up wow again
---
And you are done.
---
I wish people switch their dps meters to threat meters.
---
However, have no idea about paladins in classic
---
Huh, I always thought it was purple blob with sparkle.
---
actually, my understanding is that they were fixed a few weeks ago.  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)  has data from within the past 30, 14, and 7 days available.  It's by no means \*complete\* data (e.g, there's no data on Horde side available within the last 7 days on Bloodsail Buccaneers) since it relies on users having the addon and logging in and being able to 'see' people, but it's data.
---
Under WTF\Account\YourAccountName\SavedVariables, you should see a .lua file for Shadowed.  Delete it.  
---
Same thing under WTF\Account\YourAccountName\Server\Character\SavedVariables for character-specific settings.
---
as somebody who does the rep quest once a day or two, i dont think i've ever even seen another person farming them. nobody wants to farm that shit just to pay another 1k gold lmao
---
BEST SERVER
---
Pre-raid bis is so unbelievably far from necessary that doing any grinding that you are not having fun doing is an absurd waste of time.
---
Warlock spergs trying define shadow priest, very cringe. Bad post in general
---
The only icon i gave much thought too is aspect of the cheetah being a tiger.
---
Maybe it helps deleting your savedVariables
---
\_classic\_/WTF/Account/"AccountName"/SavedVariables in here you should find two files for ShadowedUnitFrames
---
Dont know if this works, but please try and give feedback :)
---
More like he wasnt completely stupid. :D
---
Burden of proof is on the one claiming that fireball is a threat reset. Such a claim is easy to disprove. I took three fireballs in a row with no absorbs on the two first. Fire potted the third in order to survive. The next fireball targeted someone else.
---
You have 17 slots to fill.  Stop worrying about a single item.
---
They are a plague to my bag space
---
HAHA ! Was more looking for potential guilds or whatever but touché :-)
---
I think there are only a couple pvp servers that have slightly more alliance than horde. Faerlina and Benediction. pvp servers so far have heavily skewed horde. Benediction looks like the best bet.
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/
---
For some reason SUF isn't there, checked it earlier.
---
I loved these with the exception of arcane mage because all the others had so much truth in the meme but the arcane mage.
---
They arent rare if its a guild set up. Until fire takes over. You still can be considered frost because well... you cast frost bolts. But I know a few mages that arent the frost stacking b*tch and went arcane.
---
We are multi tools and sometimes I think no one really understands just how versatile we are.
---
Oh nevermind. I read the SP orb as 12 SPI.
---
Yeah with that clear now I agree with you.
---
Dont u need to be lv62 to learn sw:Pain as Holy Paladin?
---
That's awesome, I thought it was just a leveling warrior/rogue with engineering and a nod to how silly a lot of random gear looks together. Happy to find out it was much more thought out than that! Great job.
---
Dude how can you play for fun when the gigantic billboard of a UI covers ur screen could barely tell where the dude was running between ur abilities
---
wait are the CC removal trinkets coming back with the honor update?
---
Almost done leveling my second alt.
---
My alt is there to farm gold for my main (in my case), not the other way around, so I was pretty hands-off on buying gear for them. I was a lot less conservative buying weapon upgrades/profs/consumes than normal, since I didn't need to fund mount gold, but other than that they were mostly just on their own taking upgrades as they found them.
---
I did hunter, which is a pretty gear independent class since they have insane pet scaling and flat AA damage makes up the bulk of their output. Had I done warrior or mage, who benefit a lot more from gear, I would have been more inclined to buy them solid upgrades.
---
To any priests reading, you should be spending a lot of your time spamming dispel on enemy players. This is your most important function in group PVP and will also gain you HKs.
---
Weird the server I’m on I just do pick up MC and ONY rarely not clear.  The mechanics are so simple compared to retail.
---
in vanilla i started twinking in the lull between bwl and AQ releasing.   
---
it was honestly some of the most fun I had in the game. Getting guild mates together, getting insane gear/enchants and two shotting people with 10 levels on ya.   
---
then developing a good rivalry with the other factions top group of twinks.    
---
great fun.
---
&gt; untouchable classic realm, this way they would funnel everyone who wants classic forever to one realm 
---
I mean, I kind of thought that's what the release of classic was. People who wanted classic could play *classic*.
---
Hey. At least your not a hunter or warlock. Poor bastards.
---
Gearing can be a serious grind, but it's also not 100% necessary. You don't need full pre raid bis , and in my experience barely anyone even has it.   
---
The difference in pre bis and other 60 gear is probably less noticable than perfecting boss mechanics and rotations.   
---
If you're burning out and hating the game because of the grind for the gear, do something else. It's kind of the entire point of the game though. Even if you get it next run, you'll have something else you want right after.
---
Ppl losing agro on ony is an isue for every tank tho. Ppl need to hold back dps. Ony is a competence check not a gear heal or dps check in eny way imo.
---
Really? Didn't know that GM also enforces these things.
---
Unrelated but I really wish the villages in game looked like that and weren’t just 3-4 buildings typically.
---
Official LookingForGroup chat all the way, screw World chat.
---
&gt; They still aren't going to be able to mitigate as much physical damage as a warrior
---
Well at least Prot Pallies don't need to balance their gear for threat and can just wear the tankiest gearsets in the game to compensate.
---
During the fight you cast your 2 minute curse, corruption and then shadowbolt. That’s the rotation. 
---
If you want to talk about the rest of the utility and compare it to mages then you would be remiss to not mention food/water, arcane intellect buff, counter spell, and ports that mages can also hand out.
---
&gt; it's data
---
You seem to be missing the point.
---
What good is data if it's not accurate? How did you verify that data? How do you know what the /who command is or isn't doing behind the scenes?
---
Blizzard doesn't want the addon to work, it's naïve to assume that it does.
---
If you're receiving FULL Raid DKP for being on stand by, you should be farming raid materials. Any less of an expectation and your leadership team is robbing the people actually raiding.
---
If you're not receiving full dkp on standby you should be free to do whatever you want up to and including joining another raid or logging off.
---
Perd Blade? Just a guess, its a gnarly weapon for daggers.
---
Pretty much this. Unless you're in a guild that will only give you loot if you are a top performer.... just do MC in whatever gear you have and get raid geared.
---
My expectation is that, if you are Raid Qualified and do not have a raid slot you are expected to be farming for the raiders, yes. A guild may offer you DKP for doing so, or it may just allow you to retain your Raid Qualification. Tanks have repair bills, new gear needs to be enchanted, flex players need to be reimbursed for respecs (sometimes by boss), and the guild may need capital to do things like Auction House buyouts depending on which markets it wants to control.
---
Ah yes but we didnt know that when we chose our servers did we
---
Thank god I play a filthy medium pop. Feels more like classic than a mega server less pserver shenanigans.
---
I really don't understand this myth that somehow ele / resto is deeply inferior for raiding. Some observations:
---
Mana tide isn't necessary for getting the full benefit of shaman T1. Anyway, you'll be in a melee group, and I think most raid leaders don't want the hassle of swapping players in and out of caster groups mid fight. Mana tide adds 17mp/5s (+3mp/5s from imp stream totems) which is dwarfed by Major Mana pots (75mp/5s) and Dark Runes (50mp/5s). 
---
Purification doesn't scale with +heal, only the healing of the base spell, and therefore is strongest when you have no gear, once you have preBIS it has a lot less value. Since you heal in raids by downranking and your +heal does more and more of the work as you gear up, purification loses more and more value. Already in preBIS/t1 more than half of my healing comes from +heal, so purification already offers me less than 5% increased healing, and with every upgrade that drops. It's not a bad talent, but it's not as good as it looks.
---
Healing Way is good if you are tank healing because you have t1, although t1 is plenty valuable even without Healing Way. Having 8/8 t1 and getting healing way is pretty much the only good reason to be deep resto and not ele resto for raiding. 
---
Shamans scale best with gear and consumables for healing in raids, not very much with talents. The most valuable talent for shamans for raid healing is 5% cheaper healing spells, the second -0.5s casting time on healing wave, both first tier of talent tree), and also Nature's Swiftness is useful. This is because their best spell in a 40 man is chain heal, in the other areas priests do things better (tank healing, spot healing). Gear and consumables have a far greater effect on shaman healing than talents, this is because hardly any shaman talents scale. 5mans are totally different and a lot of the shaman talents are very good for 5 man content (such as healing interruption, ancestral grace and healing way). But then if you are already preBIS / t1 geared you overgear 5 man content anyway and don't need these anymore.
---
If you are using consumables ele / resto performs at practically the same level in a raid setting as deep resto. I'd rather farm / buy consumables and have a spec in which I can farm / pvp / anything solo. You don't twist as ele / resto, you're thinking of enh / resto.
---
Right now no fight is particularly long enough to justify deep resto. It's a crutch to help gear up in 5mans for MC when you have 0 +heal gear, but in raid healing it doesn't offer anything important in the current content we have. In the longer fights in BWL, AQ40 and Naxx maybe the situation might be reassessed, but I'm not sure it's a given necessarily to go back, given that mana tide will still be offering that same 17mp/5s, which will make up an increasingly smaller proportion of mana regeneration at that point (for entering AQ40, for instance, around 70mp/5s from t2ish gear + 75mp/5s major mana + 50mp5 dark rune + 8mp/5s nightfin soup + 12mp/5s mageblood potion (phase 4) + 12mp/5s brilliant mana oil = 227 mp/5s). Purification will be of even less value the more +heal one gains.
---
If you want to make sure that you are actually putting out the highest numbers possible, then sure, go deep resto. But consumables and gear have much more of an effect - and I'd rather put the effort in on those and take 30 points in talents that don't have much of an effect and use them to make playing my shammy actually enjoying for anything other than healing a 5 man, which poses no difficulty for me as ele resto anyway.
---
I'm loving my shaman, but I just started raiding full resto. I enjoy healing but the 31/0/21 is really fun to dps in 5 man's and pvp with
---
I mean...there's no weighting to look at, one just has +9 more damage (the weight of int is absolutely tiny). That said Sublime is obviously better in PvP and it doesn't hurt to wear some stam/int in PvE a lot of the time.
---
It's an old stereotype that hunters need on everything because "Hey I can use this!" whether it is mail, leather, 2h or 1h melee weapons for stats, etc. that there is a crapload of class competition for. 
---
They're saying warriors have become the same way, especially as they are both a favored dps and tank class now.
---
That’s probably vanilla. In classic there is only one skeleton for each player. The last one despawns the moment you die again.
---
I'll undercut big on my Arcanite Bars sometimes just to be sure they sell. I logged on one day and the price was 80g instead of the typical 40g. I knew I wasn't going to be on for a day or two so I priced it at 70g. It sold right away but I couldn't risk it not selling and the price dropping to 50g in a couple days.
---
 i think the sneaky vs. magic wasn't resolved until like BFA tho
---
&gt;  I have a full/nearly full t1 tank
---
wtf is that supposed to mean?
---
Locks are useful in MC with their banish and from what I've seen on my server (Incendius/ally) it appears that there's a bit of a lock shortage. I've seen lots of pugs specifically looking for locks, and I've been in several raids with only a couple locks which is obviously a great situation when those set pieces start dropping. Both locks/hunts have good tool-kits for solo play, farming, etc.
---
You can, its just that not a lot of people are going to follow your train of thought when we go from talking about drop rate to you pointing out the proc rate as an indirect way to say it's not good
---
I agree with your overall point, guess it’s just the delivery. The mods are def asleep are the wheel around here.
---
That'd matter more if rogues didnt already have harder existing counters
---
It’s the reason I even commented to begin with, this whole thread chains from a comment about solo tanking it at 58...
---
when naxx gear comes out it is good. until then it's pretty bad
---
At level 41, you got plenty of spots that you can grind mobs in peace. If you're Horde, the area around Camp Mojache is great for mobs and the GY right there. If you're Alliance, you have a private grinding island at Feathermoon Stronghold. Don't go to STV or Tanaris or whatever for quests.... you'll just get ganked even now in phase 1.  You can do this all the way to level 50.  The Hinterhands are good for late 40s for Horde side with all the turtles.  Go to ZF and Mara when you need a break.  It's the low 50s when grinding spots are harder to find.
---
The hero we don’t deserve
---
Haha we are on loot council and I got the shoulders and the aurastone hammer earlier that night. I’m still pinching myself at work wondering if this is real life. (We also had a mage blade and perdition dagger drop in same run lol, was crazy night)
---
Ghouls can be shackled, no?
---
Already got 3 huhu! One drop and two baught for 500 and 750 gold. No need to farm anymore for... ever
---
Gotta beat 'em at their own game!
---
The game already has that, click a meeting stone
---
Except hunters are some of the best damage in raids until everyone else starts getting AQ geared. I'm never below top 10 and I raid drunk half the time. We cleared MC in about 2 hours last weekend and wound up number 4 on overall damage. The hunter comment might be relevant in a year or so, but even then hunters arent total shit at damage, they just dont top the meters anymore.
---
Problem is that last bit you said... Most healers ignore them. They're every bit as important as any other member of the group... Keep them alive. It cost you a lot less mana than me to heal my own pet
---
I love that spec. I get to be a shitty second-string tank that becomes a shitty second-string healer for one-tank fights.
---
Have a bank alt do a quick scan of the AH every time you log on and know what “of the ____” your class needs and you’ll be golden!!  Honestly any greens 1-10 make things so much easier
---
You were looking for potential guilds based on a post of a girl cosplaying? Hmm. *Ron Burgandy voice* “I don’t believe you”
---
I'm playing Horde for the first time this go around and never did Hinterlands as Alliance. It's a must do for Horde, though. I actually never did a quest that took me up that path, just one from the small camp there.
---
I found it because I was mining in the area and got invited to a group. I was dreading taking a FP the UC or EP so I tried looking up a shortcut since it was literally just a small mountain range between me and Scholo. Then it seemed so obvious once I saw it on the map.
---
The tank is equally to blame here - if an add is on the healer that means they've put out more threat than the tank. I lose aggro all the time to dps, but if something hits the healer that means either someone body pulled or I've done a bad job.
---
Maybe they're just reflecting some of your toxicity, dps warriors need to be adopted by a feral tank or they get guilted into tanking every. Single. Time.
---
dwarf priest tho is god tier
---
I always laugh that it’s a sheep ya get morphed into as it just sort of bobs around in circles doing nothing, which is what a lot of people default to in pvp scenarios anyway
---
Edit: filthy but hilarious
---
If I recall correctly, the faster pets doing more damage is due to higher uptime on Frenzy
---
Yeah, I'm not seeing a definitive answer there either. Just that they're considering what the community would want regarding those, and it's unclear to them whether bc/wotlk would be embraced *or not*.
---
The boss Garr wouldn’t be possible without warlocks banishing in MC. Mages have no such importance in endgame. And your the one that said mages only frostbolt so your kind of losing credibility at this point
---
I sometimes play dbd while playing Wow, so if a game pops up, then I will go afk. That's why I sometimes do not want to group just because I don't want to be a dead weight
---
Mind linking your logs? How much DPS are you pulling on something like Golemagg? Does your raid not have decent warriors or rogues?
---
I always thought it was abstract purple ether stuff.
---
yea i am sure, but it also used sort of mini antenna, those were bad times, but at least apart from wow i really didnt use internet back then
---
Playing a childs game for cash, and doing well, $18k in tourney winnings, this does not include, streaming revenue, team salary, sponsorships etc. I would say he's probably doing ok especially for 21 yrs old.
---
they didn't have a tank lol
---
This review is nitpicking and biased. 
---
/Dunkey
---
Why are they farming those mobs? Gold farming vendoring greys..?
---
I’ve had legit PvP wars and wrote other players names down on paper over these flowers. Over 1 flower....what has my life become.
---
I imagine a lot of people share your frustration, but they tend to put it into a different context that allows for a more balanced perspective.
---
There are always going to be wild distributions in terms of loot... some people get baron mount on their first stratholme, others can't get things to drop after "hundreds" of runs.
---
(i put hundreds in quotes, not to be cheeky, but to hint that there's a large degree of exaggeration on both sides that make anecdotes unreliable for statistical analysis)
---
Here are a few suggestions to help with some of the frustrations you mentioned:
---
* Build your own groups. If you enjoy playing with someone in a group, add them to friend and build your personalized network of consistent, positive players to invite.
---
* Reserve items in the groups you are forming. Losing a roll on a rare item to a last minute replacement that just zoned in can be frustrating, but having an item on reserve gives you the assurance that IF it drops, you won't have to have it fall through your fingertips
---
* Try to worry a little less about the specific pieces. For all intents and purposes, a slightly worse item is going to potentially be a negligible difference in output. With this mindset, you're running the dungeon for reasons other than 1-item in mind.
---
* Modify your runs if possible to farm specific boss(es) to increase probability of the item you're looking for to drop
---
* You should expect that most dungeons you run will not net you an upgrade. As you further your gear score, upgrade probability diminishes as well
---
BTW for context, I helped a couple mages from our guild get their legs from Omok last week - I was prepared to spend a few hours in there, but they both dropped back to back on 1st and 2nd run!
---
You're my level 26 Hunter!
---
&gt; why AH peeps get mad
---
They're too stupid to buy the item and relist it themselves?
---
I type it DURF to increase drama
---
My two chars are dwarves tho
---
This will be huge for Phase 1 Nefarian (not to be confused with release phases).
---
Warriors used to use battle shout for aoe threat, but I believe that is patched out.
---
*R e a l S h i t??*
---
I think the main downside damage-wise with Shadow Priest vs Mage/Lock is that the later have high rolls with crits **and** consistent damage. 
---
Lack of AoE hurts Shadow Priests in raids and there are only so many DoTs you can put on a single target due to debuff limits. 
---
Not to say that SPs are bad in raids by any means, just that most groups are going to want a limited number to buff Warlock damage and they usually won't be topping the damage meters.
---
&gt;Classic is working.
---
Is it though? I would love if blizzard would release some statistics and data that they've collected thus far. 
---
It will be interesting to see how the longevity of classic plays out. So many people want no changes, so many more want Classic+ or expansions. A very large portion of either of those groups may outright disappear a year from now once the announced phases have run their course. 
---
I think that without any data being released,and the game only being a little over 2 months old it may be a little early to tell. The only thing we have to go by is our gut feel. 
---
Hopefully we get some data in the coming months and some sort of vision, perhaps even with a more concrete roadmap, so that we can better determine. 
---
In the meantime all we can do is just enjoy what we've got without really knowing how things are actually going. :)
---
Anyone have an idea of how long it will take to hit rank 3 in pvp for the 100 gold epic mount discount. Like 1 week or 1 month debating if I should wait to buy.
---
Lmao I thought it was some dude holding his forehead oml now I’ll never look at it the same again
---
Wanna be my internet gf?
---
Do you happen to have the talent build? If not no worries I can figure out how the points populate the tree
---
Was just looking at OPs previous post about twink guilds and got curious. But I think you guys have a point. Unwarranted
---
If it wasnt for fear ward and stoneform, no one would want to play dwarf priest.... 
---
Coming from a female that plays a female dwarf priest
---
You're whining about shit that's just made up in your own head.
---
They aren't small ... and I have been watching calories so limited myself to one piece a night :)
---
Short sided? You mean a simple solution? Anyone can mark targets. If you want to do that your free to. Otherwise attack the target the tank is on
---
&gt; Tanks have repair bills, new gear needs to be enchanted, flex players need to be reimbursed for respecs
---
More succinctly asked, why is it on the "alternate" players to ensure this happens? Isn't part of being "core" preparing your own toon for success?
---
I feel like the propensity for abuse (under shitty management, which I assume for most guilds) is palpable in these guilds.
---
\^seconding and adding to this. I'm tailoring/herbalism, tailor for the robe/mooncloth and herb for the cash. Got an alt (35+) that's an alchemist and a bank alt that disenchants. Min/maxers would probably tell you to drop tailoring after you make the [Robe of the Archmage](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14152/robe-of-the-archmage) and pick it back up for bloodvine (P5?), but I'm just gonna keep tailoring and hoard patterns.
---
I guess we'll see what happens tanking MC this week, but I'm pretty sure I can outtank the warrior I was healing last week in MC.
---
*shrug*
---
The adds don't hit that hard. It's not that difficult to tank all the adds. I find it easier to be honest. No warlock fucking up the only reason they are brought.
---
there are a few items that do still mostly lifesteal procs like skullflame and demonforge and a few others I don't remember
---
Even more trivial taking a priest that has MC on their bars. Those reaver mobs do a shit ton of damage.
---
Main tanks are DPS warriors? Maybe they shouldn't apply to be main tanks.
---
Or did you just have a reactionary fit to a post about warriors and not read the comment?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/00532310505105-320305002001-05
---
That's the cookie cutter one on Wowhead. Seems like a good middleground to me that allows you to PvP &amp; PvE at a high level without gimping yourself in either.
---
I was thinking about dropping Skinning but I already have Finkles so I feel like it would be a waste if I did drop it
---
Disagree - completely arbitrary.
---
i've been mortal striking in MC and we very easily clear 10/10. all good
---
Me as well. I thought they were saying they won't be fighting any 1v1s and you're naive to think they will
---
My bad, it isn't free money because of the CD.
---
&gt;Also, is there an emote that lets an opposing faction member that I want them to rest up and fight me?
---
/point  
---
/doom  
---
/ready
---
That should get the idea across.
---
How
---
Only logging in on raid night and nothing else
---
The place I go to farm light feathers has a lot of hostile mobs in very close proximity, and is also the site of a horde quest to reach an object at the end of this gauntlet. I will typically KoS any horde lowbies I encounter while farming, as it helps me work through my frustrations about being ganked at every instance portal.
---
The first time I did this, I killed a lowbie trying to do the quest. Then I killed him and the two other lowbies he'd brought. Then the hunter outside. Then the druid nearby. Then the quest givers the first guy was trying to talk to. All told, I spent about two hours making five people miserable, and I think they eventually just logged off. I got a ton of feathers out of it though.
---
Any advice for a healing paladin?
---
Bleh - I actually miss loot council a lot as someone who parses super well with garbage gear. Feels bad to keep losing gear to people gaming the DKP system and who aren't putting it to use.
---
But why would you want to spend your time farming for others to play this game? Where is the fun there and what do u get outta that?
---
I’m in a casual guild and we clear MC in just over 2hrs, and we are by no means rushing. Ony is 1 shotted and done in 20 mins. 
---
There are many guilds looking for regular players who will show up on time and have their own buffs. 
---
No idea why you’d want to bench yourself and farm for others, when your own guild will be downing Rags soon, but each to their own.
---
Jokes on you! Vet clinics and dog boarding facilities get Slammed during this season as everyone’s going on vacation.
---
Ok.
---
Isn’t it kind of bullshit that servers aren’t able to handle massive raids like this?   It’s an MMO.  This is one of the things that the game advertises and huge fights like this are completely unplayable.
---
Both! There were two different versions with different icons.
---
Right? Oh I'm not good enough to bring along, so you think I should go farm for you?
---
It's one thing if the guild encourages it in terms of "hey if you're looking for something to do, help us out by farming this or that", but to set it as an expectation to make it to raid roster? Wow.
---
Shadowmeld only works standing still.
---
Hi, /u/thepiratewizardking
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ds2xfp/ragnaros_killed_by_noobs/). 
---
Yeah you're probably right and i agree.  CoR is a random drop from a level 60 boss, and AD is a quest reward from going through 3 different dungeons so you'll probably have about equal chance to get both.  if anything, AD is easier to get because you aren't rolling the dice that the boss drops it. 
---
As your gear gets better too you are crit less and less, meaning redoubt won't proc.  
---
The other great benefit to AD is that there isn't a "expires after 3 blocks" or whatever mechanic like redoubt and holy shield have.  The AD can potentially grant a TON of extra blocks.  10 mobs, hitting you 20 times per 3 sec (1.5 sec attack speed), is about 80 attacks in just over 10 sec.  Basically a 55% chance to block at minimum from base % chance and this proc.  60 damage per block at least from Blessing of sanc (35 dmg), shield spike (average of 25 dmg).   
---
The math works out to -
---
60 damage * 80 attacks at 55% proc rate minimum (44 procs average) = 2,640 damage!  That's a pretty crazy damage proc.  And it can only go up if you proc redoubt which would be 100% block rate but ofc only for a few blocks then it goes away. 
---
There's also the damage reduced by blocking so much- 30% boost from shield spec, probably about 100 damage blocked for easy math's sake, it's basically a "passive hp regen" of around 4500 HP over that same timeframe assuming you have 10 mobs whackin you.  So 2640 damage, and 4500 hp O.o
---
Oh ok I have no idea what dkp means
---
Now good luck farming ring from ubrs
---
lol so you aren't even gonna tell us how. downvoted and moving on
---
Someone made the mistake to mix rangers and beastmasters to reduce classes.
---
Id love to have a ranger or rifleman without the need of pets nor deadzone penalties. Pretty much like WC3 units
---
Yeah, this is the obvious question that probably should have been said in the OP. 1k-g/day seems very off.
---
I mean in a more casual guild that's fine but that debuff slot could be a corruption for a warlock with the proc or any number of other things
---
Confirmed
---
Maintaining PVP rank 3 gives you a 10% discount on everything you buy from your faction vendors, including mount cost and repair bills.
---
I’m an officer and have a raid spot and would never take or use anything that a lower guildie was told they had to spend their play time farming for us. Absolutely not.
---
Used to think he was informative, now I realized I’ve been wasting my time. Very addictive and worthless.
---
We have a very skilled hunter with lots of tier and rokdelar...he never beats the rogues/warriors/mages, except on fights where the melee has it rough like barron/shazz.
---
Spinal reaper!? To a hunter!?... Typical.
---
No, there are paths around the town without aggressive NPCs. Like where the water elemental is.
---
Shamans you can do this too! Just use rank 1 Earth Shock (otherwise now you’re the tank)
---
Unless you go hard, it isn't going to be 1 week. The average player will probably get roughly one rank a week, up to about rank 4. (On a PvP server at least)
---
Haha yeah, 
---
* -2000 on threat
---
* Nightfall proc while casting shadowbolt
---
* Hold on to your butts 
---
* **Double crit**
---
* rut roh
---
At least in dungeons by then you can DC/SB combo and probably finish the mob off, but gotta be careful on the higher HP bosses if you don't let the tank get a healthy threat lead.
---
Oh man I never checked to see the difference in the icon.  I just always assumed they were the same.  Damn you’re good at this
---
Someone doesn’t read the theorycrafting discord 😂
---
Any raiding DPS that doesn't have a threat meter is a waste of a raid slot.
---
Get Herbalism. Easy to farm and will keep your consumable costs down since you can get get an alchemist to ccraft your consumes with your own farmed herbs. They sell very well and it's an easy relaxed gold farm.
---
This guy is talking completely out of his ass and doesn't know shit about shit. He's some pencildick dweeb that wants to argue semantics because he's a dipshit loser that likes to argue on the internet.
---
Is the data 100% accurate? Probably not.  But it's more than accurate enough to point OP in the right direction.
---
Net-o-Matic projector and pray it doesn’t backfire
---
Get force of will and ideally a skullflame shield, thorium spike that bad boy, slap on ret aura and just pull the entire sm into your consecrates.  The boss handily aggros the whole place you dont gotta waste much time.
---
Assuming you're not a pugger: That's entirely between you and your CL or RL. But your output will suffer. I'm certain that a rogue with pre-BiS swords and a meta build will make you look bad. Unless you simply rolled for loot, I'd assume that you were entrusted with those gear pieces to maximize your raid's overall DPS output.
---
Personally, I would never raid with a suboptimal build because I would rather carry my own weight. But that's just me. The content is trivial enough. If your guild is cool with it, do what you want.
---
you don't need crowd pummelers in dungeons, and if you've been farming and using them for that, I pity you
---
Hunters can use Eng too...
---
STOP DOTS!

Technically shamans

no way. we gotta make sure rag can't heal too much

What is your opinion on the 1984-85 San Antonio Spurs?
---
I present to you Gracespear, leader of The &lt;Northwatch Hold&gt; Guild.
---
She's a level 20 Night Elf Warrior in white uniform, wearing a Theramore Tabard. She challenges any Horde inside and around The Hold, and today she managed to defeat 3 invaders at once!
---
They tried to escort a valuable blood elf asset out of Northwatch control, and decided that I was worth their time defeating!

Here are some more pictures, for those interested.

This is excellent advice. I have an active guild and I should be able hopefully find an enchanter to help me out with those buffs.

---
You can absolutely delete JUST a single addon's settings without uninstalling the addon. I'll explain below, but I also want to give a little background information so you understand how it all works. I am also assuming you are running WoW on a PC, I assume it is the same for a Mac but the file locations may be slightly different.
---
Addon data is stored in two places within your World of Warcraft program folder. The first is within your "Interface Folder". `C:\[...]\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`This is where the addon's lua script, xml, api, etc is stored. You can consider this the core of the addon and it contains all the rules for how the addon should run. If you delete this folder the addon will no longer exist in-game.
---
The second place addon data is stored is within your "WTF" folder. More specifically, within the SavedVariables folder. `C:\[...]\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\[your account's name]\[your realm's name]\[your character's name]\SavedVariables` **This is where the addon's settings are saved.** There are also SavedVariables folders located immediately within both your account folder and your realm folder but these are typically only used for addons that share settings across multiple characters. For most cases you will use the SavedVariables folder within your specific character's folder. **Within this folder you will find multiple files ending in ".lua" and ".lua.bak". Deleting these files will delete the user preferences for whatever addon they are named after.** So, for example, deleting the files named Questie.lua and Questie.lua.bak will delete the setting for the Questie addon. After deleting these files WoW will make new default ones the next time you log in.
---
I hope this was both helpful and educational!
---
As others have kind of said, there is some validity here but since we can't see any more than a chat log it's not possible to judge. Generating threat relies on generating rage which relies largely on getting hit. If dps takes everything off you right away you will be fighting just to get a single target back, much less 3 or 4. This also makes the healer heal more which is obviously a vicious cycle. It doesn't sound like the tank was doing great in this case, but it's just important to consider how all this stuff is connected before pointing fingers.
---
Level alt with mining.
---
My alt is 18 and shes netted 150g selling ore.
---
Amazing haha good job!
---
I mean, looking at the picture, those are both left ears. You are VERY lopsided.
---
I'm going to have to disagree. As a healer our threat can get up there when we are healing everyone bc dps can't wait for tank to get aggro. If a dps pulls all the mobs b4 the tank establishes agro, then dps drops aggro after being hit a few times, the healer will have already been stacking agro while the tank isn't bc they are chasing the mobs. 
---
Not like the dps run to the tank if they get agro.
---
Any class can play value wars on the AH... is there any substance to your post behind your brag?
---
I know exactly what happened as a fellow tank:
---
The Mage pulled threat on the main target so the warrior burned his taunt, or even two taunts to try and hold it... in the meantime a secondary target or targets turned to beat on the healer. The warriors taunt/taunts were down and he had nothing left to try and pull that secondary back while still struggling to maintain threat on the main target from the mage.
---
Priest dies, everyone blames the tank like a bunch of classless scrubs.
---
OP and the rest of you should feel bad. Poor tank trying to do the best job he/she can.
---
How much you played in 3 days? That’s the real question
---
With something called a credit card lolz
---
I know I will obviously have an edge on this front because I rolled a warrior and am not afraid to tank, but my friend I highly recommend starting your own groups.  Can't get booted or get shafted by "reserved" gear if you are the party lead :)
---
Great attitude though and best of luck out there.  Try to befriend some tanks who you can call on to dungeon grind maybe? :)
---
In my 40 years on this god-forsaken rock, I've come to the conclusion that people tend to lash out at others over things they most dislike in themselves. 
---
So if you see someone like this, it's a fairly accurate assumption that they themselves don't fully grasp how to "economy" correctly.  
---
Probably following guides and best practices, but still coming up short and they don't understand why.
---

---
in TBC
---
The tank is "on" multiple targets though. When I'm tanking I'm constantly tabbing through them applying sunders to hold threat on every target from the pull. It's not like tanks just get in there and facetank a single mob at a time, we've got to hold threat on everyone all at once. It's your job as a tank to mark the target that you have generated the most threat against so that the DPS can put out damage on the correct target.
---
I used to think the immolate spell icon was just a humanoid figure looking at their own hands while they were burning alive, didn’t realize it was just a hand with fire around it
---
The seal fate build becomes better once you get a shit ton of crit gear.

that's when you realize grinding random mob will give you better xp/hour than going for that quest

I didn’t even know it was a dwarf till today so.

He clicked accept when he got a channel invite.
---
At work, idk why but my logs are shitty over a whole raid but had a priest whisper me saying I was overall dps an entire run. Golemagg I had 443 dps, person below me was another hunter. At the top or near it for every fight for us is a hunter besides Rag.
---
I'm also undergeared, only have 3 epics (not GS or Rhok'dar). Other than that pre-BIS everything except chest. Rogues and warriors are usually right below the hunters or on some over us but we still pull more dps through an entire raid. If your hunters are at or near the top then they are either destroying their itemization with bits and pieces of GS or their rotation or spec is subpar.
---
I appreciate this. Thanks. They’re much better than shadow wrath bracers for pvp so I’m going to follow this tonight.

My second toon is a lvl 16 rogue, am going combat swords, can I spec a bit into subtlety for BRD pickpocket runs or is that just not optimal for raiding? 
---
Also, how is combat swords in pvp?
---
Better computer
---
Idk maybe it did, but I don't usually die at all in our raids and if I do it's not to overaggro. So yeah. If the tanks aren't shit, then you really don't need to look at threat. Obviously if I was in a pug or worse guild I'd put on the threat meter again.
---
I'd like to add to your list: Warriors who 1) will actually tank, far too many times you see a warrior in LFG asking for a tank, and 2) when they do tank use the appropriate gear, stances, and abilities as needed, not just charge every pack in zerker stance while wearing leather and DWing and expecting the healer to keep them alive.
---
Also a shout-out to the Battle Mages in Strat Live as amazing MC targets.
---
If you have a friend and play with them a lot (warrior) a holy paladin can be rewarding. However playing a holy paladin is super dull, ret is fun but we all know playing ret wont get you into groups/raids very easily.
---
How do you guys deal with constant ganks? 
---
I am in my mid 50s now and all of the quests are in zones where 60s farm various things. And, well, I feel like I spend 30% of the time corpserunning. Considering the fact that I can get 1-2 hours of wow a day at most, at this point, I have a feeling that getting 60 will take another month. 
---
Do you guys have any advice?
---
Had a wipe at Kirtonos because our tank didn't know and got yeeted out of the instance. Pretty much every non-caster boss in Scholo can knock back so it's easier to just tank every one of them against a wall.
---
I rolled need in an instance on a 150g alchemy recipe that required 300 alchemy.  I rolled need (as did the party leader) and while we were waiting for the other party members to make their selections, the PL asked if I was even an alchemist.  I said yes but I was only 288/300.  He raged since I "can't even learn the recipe." 
---
I was booted from the party, and the timer thing to teleport me out started ticking.  The others in the party waited to roll until the end of the timer (they were all in the same guild).  I'm new to WoW so I don't know if this is how it's supposed to work, but I got the loot message saying I won the roll. Sweet, right?  No. Not sweet.  My dumbass had my inventory full so I never got the drop and was force-hearthed out of the instance.  
---
Is there anything I can do to get the recipe back or am I completely SOL?  Aside from the obvious of not being an idiot and leaving empty inventory slots, is there anything I can do in the future to prevent this from happening again?
---
I'm a simple man. I see a Boondock Saints reference, I upvote.

Lol, farming lotus is significantly more difficult that farming thorium. There is literally only 1 per hour, and it spawns at one of multiple locations. The person/group that got the last one is certainly tracking the timer. It only becomes efficient if you get lucky and find one, then spend the time to follow up on the timer for a few hours. Meanwhile you can farm mobs in one clump of thorium spawns and just wait for them to spawn. You should see roughly 4 per hour. Getting lucky on arcanite or sapphires is a shitty part.
---
good one tell that to my 3700x 2080
---
Well idk what they're doing or how your meters are compared to ours but that's not how it's working. Hunters are at the top or near and through the entire thing. Maybe I'm not using the right meter? I use details with damage done, I thought the number right of total damage was the dps, but I also know they have a different "damage per second" option instead of damage done.
---
All our rogues and warriors have prebis and pieces of gear out of MC.
---
I played Druid in vanilla and I know they’re boring. Can’t burst anything, just play defensive and dot your enemies to a slow death. They’re not bad at all, just really bland imo
---
You lose your title.  You're thinking of the titles they added in a later expansion for people who used to pvp in vanilla to be able to display their pvp ranks of the past.
---
95% of people will drop group the second they're done tho
---
There's only seven required mobs to unlock Eranikus. That's the six on the top layer of the temple and Jammal. Everything else in the instance is technically optional.
---
Taunt also applies a debuff on anything you use it on which forces it to attack you for 3 seconds. So if any dps out aggro you with their initial burst, you still keep aggro. The tooltip is kind of misleading. By using the taunt mocking blow taunt combo you are keeping up a debuff that forces the boss to attack you. I literally do this all the time on my warrior.
---
You do realize the tanks swap their target every global cooldown or two, right? I'm starting to think you're not a tank, and probably pull aggro from your tanks by thinking you're attacking the one he's "on" when you fail to realize that the tank doesn't just sit on a single target the whole fight.
---
Edit: Also, lack of personal responsibility? It's the personal responsibility of the tank to mark targets for a smooth run.
---
Warriors (like me) have the advantage of excluding rogues from either of these farms. It took me 75 runs to get my HoJ and all of those were caster heavy (you know because ae is so so important for this camp!!!). I always feel bad for rogues they will basically always have competition for HoJ.
---
This is kind of neat too.  I like the addition of Riposte.
---
So Re: macros, I dont quite understand when click #2 activates line #2 in the macro, or if one click does everything etc.
---
Do you need a click for each /cast?  Or if riposte is not up, clicking once activates SS?
---
You're the worst part of this community.
---
Got my HoJ on my ret paly at 55
---
I spit on every druid playing that spec in raids. :P
---
This guy has 0 idea what he's talking about.
---
The site's aggregate data is more than accurate enough to answer OP's question and guide him to where he wants to be.
---
6 second actually.
---
Love druids as a warrior. Armor, stats, and thorns! Plus some HoTs for your next pull as a cherry on top.
---
I thought it was the back of a purple cloak moving right before the blink
---
It's just called spy. Why should it be banned? People have 100 different add ons to provide them knowledge about what's happening around them and spy is your line?
---
Every rank 14 I knew back in the day had multiple people account sharing.  They had a group going 24/7.
---
It's def that off brand processor lmao
---
Mind soothe more or less forces  the target mob to treat you as though you were in stealth: You can get a lot closer to it without drawing aggro.
---
Also, I wouldn't take OP's advice about MCing powerful dungeon enemies - not only will your group probably need you healing, but mind control causes an absolutely *legendary* amount of threat that the tank is definitely going to struggle to overcome.
---
To add to /u/ponzLL's post -
---
Mind vision:
---
- See which dire maul tomes have spawned without fighting 50 packs
---
- Use it on rogues just before they stealth, and now you can permanently see them and communicate their location to the party
---
- Scan caves for ore nodes and quest interactibles without taking a single step
---
- Scan for enemy players nigh-invisibly by scouting through mobs and critters
---
- Check the position of patrols when you can't draw LoS to them
---
- Find the location of allies and people you want to trade with without partying up
---
- Pinpoint enemy players that you're able to target, but who are hiding behind terrain
---
- Find named mobs hidden in godforsaken gauntlets of nearly-identical mobs
---
- Make people profoundly nervous at great distance
---
Mind soothe:
---
- Imagine your entire group was rogues, and it's all thanks to you.
---
- Skip pulls that suck ass
---
- Skip pulls that are easy, but you're lazy
---
- Sneak into places you have no business being while alive
---
- Speedrun content for a laughably cheap 100-mana cast
---
- Kill people without aggroing the guard they're hiding beside
---
- Collect resource nodes without aggroing every bears in a 40 yard radius
---
- Bestow one of the most anxiety-inducing debuffs in the game upon unsuspecting players, who will fret over the ambiguous description and shadowy particle effect
---
&gt; I've been a pally tank since vanilla
---
K
---
&gt; I'm upset that design choices - which were later improved upon - aren't improved yet in this version.
---
Idk I don't have any sympathy especially since you knew what it was like, having played since vanilla.
---
And was never a warlock
---
Very nice!  I’m excited for twinking.  Got a 19 priest 29 rogue and 39 lock all ready to go and now working on my 49 warrior.
---
Sounds like a tank issue if the DPS aren't able to DPS without pulling.
---
These aren’t BIS.
---
You're assuming they made that change to break the census addon rather than to help stop spam invites and whispers by gold sellers, and at the same time you're telling me that my assumption that /who generally works is unfounded even though people use /who on a daily basis and find the data returned valid?  Nice to meet you, pot. I'm kettle. 
---
Thanks for conceding that people are in fact not just making up numbers.
---
Lol pally tank, shadow priest in healing gear. I already see the problems.
---
Easy Money would be tailoring/skinning and then just farm dungeons. You would be able to use all the cloth, all the skins, vendor the trash and BoP's and send the BoE's to your bank to D/E.
---
Otherwise it's going to depend on your professions and spec.
---
Lvl 58. Still wearing lvl 38 greens because no  
---
upgrades
---
Do sunken temple until 52/3 then start doing brd arena and prison area, then first half. Tank everything from here on out. Once you are 56/7 do lower blackrock spire,  start your onyxia attune. Once you are 58 you can do everything.  Dungeon spam to 60 and pick up all your raid gear along the way.
---
2h arms will always be the best.
---
That's not my goal.
---
Lol you have fun with that.
---
Won't be huge when you never have more than 2-3 mobs up at the same time and when the pally goes oom one minute in the fight spamming kings.
---
Tis very smexy, and if you're raid healing as opposed to tank healing you're only lacking 10% healing and mana tide. Perfectly fine for a WF dropping healer.
---
Will need respecs in the more serious raid content, but for now it works great.
---
Played a mage since BC and never knew what it was...
---
Exactly. If im playing a mage and have a "collect 15 ribs" quest I'm sure as hell not gonna group up with anyone other than another mage. Me killing 7 mobs at the same time as warrior jonnyboy struggles with 1 mob but him getting half of my loot is dumb and why should I agree to that?
---
Fuck the guild you mentioned. Farming Mats for other players is ridiculous. You’re doing the raids you’re getting opportunities to get the gear don’t change anything. Don’t rush yourself into a guild that thinks they’re big shots because they’re more experienced at doing researched raids that have already been cleared many times in the past.  
---
Plenty of time for MC/Ony and get the gear requirements. There’ll be plenty of people raiding BWL that comes out so you don’t need to rely on elitist pricks.
---
Rogues can go stealth runs in duos with a rogue or other stealth class, or even solo it if they git gud
---
I'll let you know when I get banned.
---
Still better than Tips lol
---
Probably will teach him to find a guild with a tank that can actually put out threat.
---
At 51 even two handed I'm still at 49% DR. Charge&gt;demo roar&gt;thunderclap mitigates a lot of damage
---
The lack of accountability by not owning up to the fact that you were probably tabbing through targets and refuse to mark targets for others says it all. Just don't tank. You're going to wipe groups with your plausible deniability mentality.
---
how many hours a day were you putting in to hit rank 11?
---
Nothing you can do unfortunately.
---
I consider it pretty BM to roll on high value plans if you cant learn them right then and there.
---
Wowhead and icy-veins will break down everything you need to know
---
This is an ignorant comment.
---
Because the honor system came out before wsg was added...
---
P U S S Y
---
&gt; That’s because in canon you are the “group of adventurers” who started as nobodies, but went on to save Azeroth dozens of times over the years. Your character participated in the defeat of onyxia, rangnaros, the lich king, deathwing, and many more powerful threats. Of course you’re going to known as a champion of your faction. 
---
In modern wow canon you actually don't really exist.
---
It wasn't a "rag tag of adventurers" who slain the LK. Tirion did it 1v1.
---
It wasn't Nilhilium and co who cleared the sunwell. It was primarily the draenei forces from the alliance, specifically the alliance. Not even the shattered sun offensive. Just the alliance.
---
&gt; 2h
---
lul
---
What groups are you running with that people stop to drink each pull?
---
Classic wow is bad game design? You don’t say
---
I'd never bring a boomie. They aren't worth bringing just for the crit buff. I'd always bring one Spriest. One, and only one, purely to heal the warlocks while they life tap and provide them with a damage buff. It isn't a huge deal to give them some gear either. You gear that one single spriest and then everyone else has free rolls. It's not ideal - you'd be better off giving the gear to locks or mages, but you can't bring someone and not give them any gear. I mean you can, but that's just really mean.
---
What kind of stuff are you even talking about though? Enchanting mats? Herb/ore is still easy enough to get, and there are enough people still leveling that the market is pretty saturated. And the 39/49 twink brackets are two of the least popular, and we won't be seeing twinks till P3 with BGs. What kinda stuff is selling from there?
---
Which they shouldn't be. The entire point of elves in fantasy is they're tall, attractive, and thin. Of course all the 14 years olds with fragile masculinity when BC was announced collectively flipped their shit in horror when they found out the Horde was getting a race with vaguely effeminate men that didn't look like cartoonisly jacked body builders. Looking at the Warcraft 3 models for Belfs they're definitely not nearly as built as their WoW models are, even the heavy melee units, the Lieutenants, just look like they're wearing bulky armor.
---
Of course one of the reasons for adding Belfs was to hopefully balance out the factions by attracting some Alliance players who only play pretty looking races, which I can see as being pretty controversial, but having elves be thin, especially since Belfs are primarily casters, shouldn't be.
---
This guy lost a felstriker to the tank 100% confirmed.
---
he also likes to sell pizza and push insurance
---
True. Might not be necessary if you don't pull enough dps for it to matter
---
Arathi Basin isnt coming out untill next year mate.
---
Crowd pummeler without the use is still a decent stat stick.
---
That my tank is in 6/8 t1? Is reading comp hard? 
---
I like that you're now trying to avoid the topic though because you got shut down by an actual tank player. Lmao.
---
Pluuuuus Ultra?
---
Interesting. Time to get rid of our spriest I guess, thanks for the info.
---
Not if the mage waits for agro before going ape shit.
---
Not to mention vanishing breaks sap if they aren't in combat with another player as well. I'll sap if I know the group/tank; but it usually means I'll have to either evasion or sprint out after. A good tank/mage knows to let me get I'm sap range and then either start bow shot or start casting sheep. This way I can time my sap to hit just before they initiate combat. Otherwise it's a pretty pointless endeavor. 
---
Some places to consider forcing these saps: drakk room in ubrs (vs an assassin preferably) , any duo/trio content (dm n stealth runs etc).
---
Nothing concrete to add, but I do wish that Blizzard would consider at least somewhat reducing respec costs. A middle ground would be nice. It's not dual spec and it can still be somewhat of a gold sink to dissuade people from going back and forth all the time.
---
In a real minmax 40man raid there's barely any warlocks either though, almost only rogues/warrs.
---
I did the same thing oh so many years ago and "ninjaed".  I got a friend that still accidentally rolls on everything and hes been playing for a long time.  Hopefully you'll get the hang of it.  ;) good luck.  Rogues are really fun.  Go to wailing caverns if you can good pants and set. Or the defias looks cool on everyone
---
P2 is coming shortly but in this context OP is talking about the second phase of the Onyxia fight. At 65(?) % Ony jogs to the front of her room and takes to the air.
---
As a tank, the only mob that I've ever cared to let be MC'd are the battle mages in live strat.
---
They justified it that Blood Elf Paladin is a Warrior with magical abilities cuz even the lowest of the low of Blood Elves are still more magical than the average joe
---
I had 4 mobs chasing me and saw a druid of my own faction mine a rich thorium vein. I wanted it, so I gathered all the mobs on him and his own rejuvenation made him get aggro, then ofc I yoinked the node while he was taking a big assbeating.
---
Yes the damage dealt is how it's looked at. It says total damage dealt for example 50 000 then in brackets the dps (600) or something similar. Details is the most used dps meter it's totally fine.
---
They're either not as pre-bis as you think or they're doing something very wrong.
---
You don't even need nades really. It's a pretty one sided duel, all you have to do is play around their mana. 
---
Dot up, and then wand them down, if they try to heal, start mana burning, if they don't shift they get burned, if they shift they spend loads of mana anyway and you keep damaging.
---
Basically you just sw:p wand and dispel yourself when they put swarm + moon. It really is one sided. But druids VS others is also one sided to the druid! It's all the game of rock paper scissors except warlocks haha
---
I spent half of vanilla on a PVE server and this wasn't true. At least half the day TM vs SS was guaranteed PvP, and even late into the night people would still be around fighting. Running around enemy zones flagged would get you some action much of the time as well.
---
The important part is you got to feel good about yourself, which we both know doesn't happen that often.
---
Garrs possible with a few solidly geared tanks. The original comment was about the rotation and you keep wondering off point
---
Agreed, just be aware that you really need to rush down eranakus then.
---
Classic Wowhead doesn't say how much HP he has but I think its in the ballpark of 20-40k.  I don't know how long the green dragons take to reach him and start fighting back.
---
You havent seen top guilds kill garr have you
---
1 day you will be good at trolling but today is not that day
---
Do you have have stealth placed on the other bar when it switches?
---
*Overkill might override the effect.
---
Yeah; I'd only reserve it for pulls where one mob is extremely dangerous, and the rest of them are going to take more than 30s to kill anyone. Otherwise it tends to be more trouble than it's worth.
---
Hard disagree on trinkets, you want the pvp trink and another useful activated one there, like a reflector.
---
Literally unplayable

In vanilla ive been prot from lvl 10 to 60 whit 0 issues. In the end i menage to become the main tank in all raid contents due skill ive build.
---
You dont need any just do what you like to do.
---
Skill&gt;all
---
That feeling when I resubbed in Legion and found my totems gone.
---
Seriously, why strip the class like that?
---
Did the Alliance have any characters dressed as ....ghosts... on this raid?
---
Lore-wise resurrection is very rare. Canonically, we never died to a random boar in durotar. Spirit rezzers are just a gameplay mechanic for flavor.
---
Otherwise we would have just rez’d Tirion after he died.  Sylvanas wouldn’t be concerned over her dwindling Val’kyr count (as they sac themselves to keep her alive). Stuff like that.
---
I would rather spec fury or arms for dungeons, so I can still farm rep or speed up my DM:E runs.
---
just do prot when you start raiding.
---
Maybe so in MC and BWL, but in aq40 and naxx the optimal raid comp shifts to include more casters due to their scaling and itemization finally catching up as well as many fight mechanics in those raids being very unforgiving towards comps with too many melee.
---
Delete your post, you leaked your email
---
I did Maraudon at 50 something resto shaman. Our tank had agreed to a full run. But went AFK for 15min without explanation when he came back. Right before we started Noxxion he stated that this was his last boss. We were mad that he had agreed to a full run and went  afk and needed items to vendor. We were mostly made up of people trying to get the scepter so we needed Noxxion for quest. We almost wiped with our Rogue killing Noxxion alone at the end. I used Ankh and rezzed everyone but him so he didn't get the quest item he needed from Noxxion. It was the most petty thing I've ever done in wow but considering he wasted our time I felt it was deserved.
---
&gt; You can call it pointless but their design logic is pretty evident in the class/race spread.
---
You're misunderstanding me.  I'm saying it's pointless to debate the race choices on the merits of lore, because it's evident that lore was not the motivating factor.  It was logistics.
---
No it’s a red and purple swirly octopus with a star on it
---
That's not how it works till arenas.
---
Lol I got pretty lucky. Mask in run 2 HoJ within 20 and Lord general sword for me, also got bow from DM E within 3 runs. Done MC twice and Ony once and am sitting with 3 epics now too. Life is good
---
Does anyone know of a roll tracker addon that shows party rolls in a window? There is Roll Tracker Classic (https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25330-RollTrackerClassic.html) but that only shows manual /roll, not the ones done by group loot.
---
Ah ok, this makes sense. Guilds generally use a system called dkp (dragon kill points) and long story short you earn points to buy / bid on gear.
---
Some guilds will allow you to gain full points even by not being in the raid (because it's full and you're on standby).
---
If you're on standby but getting full points I was saying you should be doing something for the guild. It would be bizzare to be getting full points for a raid and you were available or doing anything productive.
---
No it's only okay for warriors to take them not paladins. 
---
Yeah. My ideal bachelor party would be a DnD game. Chances are it'd be my husband to be's first choice too. So we may just have a game of DnD.
---
Even then, you gotta put the work to sell it.  Seeing edgemasters going for 200g because “I don’t want this to be my problem anymore”
---
All I see is his gut hanging down xD
---
It really is. I'm 30/21/0 and living the good life. Can raidheal as good as full holy Paladins AND can dungeon tank every 5 and 10 man and Onyxia. Prot Paladins are ridiculous in all these 5 mans where all the Warriors are rage starved and hating themselves while I'm just spamming max Consecration and never go oom because of Flurry Axe SoW spam.
---
Also my gear is ridiculously stacked because nobody plays Holy or Prot paladin and all the unwanted staff goes to me.
---
Oh, and you can also dungeon farm with this spec and some thorns items and get some decent gold in the meantime.
---
All in all I'm pretty happy and hybrid play is perfectly viable.
---
I still laugh at every Ret pala I come across though, these guys really hate themselves, lol.
---
Shift 1-3 for stances 
---
Make your bars look the same 
---
Weaponswap macros are legit tho
---
&gt;One thing is for sure though: Blizzard did jack shit to promote balance and made everything worse by opening up transfers without limiting them to specific factions.
---
As far as we know. 
---
If there is one thing(alright 2 after talking about launch week woes and lack of transfers to help fix it) that I really hate how blizzard is handling with WoW classic it's the lack of data given to the players. 
---
It's all black boxed whether it's in relation to if it's a success/failure, future vision and roadmap or just server specific information such as player count. 
---
It's all felt like a truly rushed and cobbled together launch and it would be nice to know the numbers.
---
In this case it will activate all abilities in order, all at the same time. 
---
However, since Riposte will trigger a GCD, the SS won't cast. Start attack will be cast, since it is not on the GCD. 
---
There is the option to /castsequence Ability 1, Ability 2, Ability 3. in which case the first press will cast Ability 1, then the second will activate ability 2 etc. (It will keep the order until it is able to cast the next spell in the sequence).
---
Really? I think an mmo set in the starcraft universe would be interesting... but it's a game much more dependent on units and strategy than the heroes involved. So, it would be difficult to do well.
---
Probably not the answer you are looking for.  But wait until you hit 60 and pay someone to solo it for you.  I ran the princess 15 times while leveling saw the ring 3 times but lost the roll.  
---
Once you hit 60 there should be a few warlocks and priests that are soloing her for $$$ that will be more than happy to sell you a ring.  I paid 15g your server may differ on pricing.
---
Is there a link to explain wtf each icon is? Some of them are totally crazy looking
---
How does your guild handle lapses in the Raiding roster over the holidays?
---
Yup, they are bad players.
---
Hearing old names like footman frenzy is like scratching an old part of my memory.
---
Lvl 19 dwarf female rogue
---
Prepare yourself for more LFG snobbery - when you hit the range of 55+ dungeons ( starting with BRD) most groups aren't going to want you since you're not 60.  The remedy to this is to run your own groups.
---
Damn son, have you bought a lucky charm by any chance? Soon I will be lvl 30 and will sell them myself lmao
---
Generally on high value stuff that can be sold, everyone rolls the same. So if everyone was rolling greed, you should have too. Typically everyone will roll need to keep people from taking things.
---
I probably see how Herod will go
---
HUNTER WEAPONS ALL
---
Not gonna lie that got me!
---
There is a range limit on awarding loot to somebody in a dungeon. For example in Maraudon, people can not get Princess loot where they port in with the scepter, they have to move to one of the cubbies that is closer to her room and you need to kill her in a specific spot too. Odds are the rares in SM are significantly out of range to pass loot to somebody waiting at the entrance.
---
Raid zones do not seem to have the same restriction.

Nope, they are a big guild.  RP doesn't matter for guild names, only character names.   And that's iffy at best also.
---
Basically the only difference in a RP and PVP server is the RP server has stuff going on at Goldshire.
---
The decay is percentage-based, so it gets worse the higher you go. But it's still there for lower ranks.
---
Not quite till p3. If you get both t2 and the rest t1 it's very slightly better than shadowcraft.
---
It's soundboard or something.

It took me 32 resets to get my ring, the warlock I was paying to run me was not happy lol.

"LIGHT GIVE ME ONE FINAL BLESSING"
---
come on dude. if you're going to shit on wows story then at least have the grounded perspective to recognize its always been shit.
---
This would seemingly require redoing the entire level bracket system also
---
Look at the last 30 days. It is based on census data. If nobody adds the data the results are not going to be accurate
---
Or if you're a Tauren, a *moo* point.
---
Just get to 60 already
---
Yeah and again I play on a more casual server so I was expecting it but still funny. 
---
Yeah I love how useful I am in group settings, between water, poly novas that allow aoe to happen/save people, hell even rank 1 frosbolt is useful outside of pvp! Mage is just amazing outside of raids that is 😗😗
---
Do you mean Jed/Rend runs by 5man runs? I thought those were super easy when I did them.
---
Locks are awesome. Great levelers with a couple different leveling specs. Healthstones, soulstones to reduce run backs both while solo and dungeons, 4 different pets. Free 40 mount and reduced epic mount cost for a badass looking mount.
---
Theres not a ton of them in raids, so if you get into a team your chance of tier gear is good. They do solid damage through all tiers. In pvp they are super fun both in open world and bgs.
---
My main in vanilla, bc, and bfa was a lock. And always my first alt otherwise, including classic. Super hard not to like playing one.
---
Lmao, no lucky charms here. I always felt if I go in to a dungeon with the idea I won't get anything then I can never be dissatisfied with no loot dropping. Just gotta go with a "no rush" attitude and the game will treat you right, at least I think
---
Whats going on here? Another ddos or something?
---
IIRC, some of the quests inside AV give XP the first time you turn them in.
---
I was contemplating the same a while ago. But having tanked a lot of dungeons while leveling. And I still do at level 45 I feel that I don’t want to tank “forever”. It’s about 4 times as stressful to tank than to dps as a Warrior in dungeons and i sense that it will burn me out if content gets much harder as it is atm. 
---
I tank will full arms spec mosty with sword and board. 
---
In addition I want to look cool and I find the odd leather and mail pieces extremely cool looking and I will like to continue to use that and that’s impossible for a tank to wear. I still wear the mail herods shoulders since that look so badass and as a dps warrior I can continue to wear them without too much sacrifice even at max level.
---
I do have a lot of respect for players going full tank spec. You take one for the team for sure. Hopefully you enjoy the stress hehe.
---
I'm getting my classic MMO's mixed up I guess!
---
Seriously, this could just be a key turner who doesnt like doing extra steps
---
I'm sorry, that only means the other rogues you're rolling with are bottom shelf.
---
Why did you say you were 288? He didn’t need to know.
---
Pvp is much different than PvE. Thats why a swarm of low levels can take down a high level in PvP but no matter how many level 20s you bring into Zul Farrak they will be decimated. 2-3 levels is completely unnecessary, the levels for HKs are fine right now.
---
Ah had no idea it was percent based.
---
Ah ok. This raiding bussiness is serious stuff lol. I think once I ding 60 that'll be it for me. I don't have the time to dedicate my time to something like that.  I was just hoping to get my benediction staff and then roll and alt. This is my first ever toon and I just play video games for fun and not try to make a second job out of it lol
---
It already has. This place is a fucking trash can.
---
I farmed epl water eles in off hours.
---
Observed an enemy mage AoE farming in Hillsbrad.  Saw that he was getting close to being OOM and still had 3 melee mobs left to kill.
---
He started casting Blizzard and I Hammer of Justice'd him then mooned him.
---
The mobs killed him.
---
This happened shortly after I was corpse camped by Squintz (nsfw: &gt;!fucking level 60 Undead Rogue bastard!&lt;) from Hillsbrad to SFK.  I just wanted to run a fellow Pally through the dungeon at 46.  You're on my list Squintz.
---
\-Lt, Kirtonos
---
One of the reasons hunters look good at the start (at least in my guild) is they get gear much faster because there are elss of them.  We have 2 hunters in our 40  man raid and 6+ rogues and mages and 5 warlocks.  So yes obviously the hunters get geared up quicker.   Plus they get an epic weapon from a quest item while the average rogue is still trying to get his UBRS blue.  (I assume hunters can do that quest in phase one, but I admit I didn't check, so  correct me if I miss the mark here)
---
Gouge, Kick, Blind mouseover make you lose combopoints.
---
Level 50 rogue right now, what's the bare minimum I can start doing BRD and the likes? Preparing to dungeon grind to 60 once phase 2 drops lol
---
I'm probably gonna end up 52/53 not much time to play before the patch drops ha
---
Not Heartseeker, though. Alliance dominates that server.
---
Lol I love the fort buff idea. Gonna use that
---
Hunters will be top DPS total raid. Melee dps will top certain fights. There's enough melee preventing stuff such as Shazzrahs Arcane Explosions and Baron Geddons fire pulses for ranged to come out on top. Hell hunters out range Magmadars and core hounds fear/stun, Golemaggs debuff and Rag stuff. Ofc they are gonna do most dmg over the raid
---
costs less
---
I don't know what happened here, but there is a hunter and mage. If the hunter opened with multishot (they always do) and the mage opened with aoe (they always do) then the tank will have no rage. Hunter feigns, mage blocks, warrior taunts one mob but only has rage to auto attack from this point on. Next person to have aggro will be healer.
---
How can you see how many points each food gives?
---
Shit, I'm just happy to get a tank who doesn't use Taunt as an opener and blow all his rage on Heroic Strikes.
---
Did you read his whole post?
---
For what it’s worth after the tinket the honor system is garbage for rewards. Only the most no life hardcore types have a shot at the epic items. You could raid for 4-6 hours a week and get lots of epics without all this grinding players. Also without BGs it’ll be a shitshow.
---
TLDR PvP honor system benefits only hardcore players and everyone else is just inconvenienced when questing by roaming 5-mans looking to pick you off.
---
I logged into UC while this was on going. I thought the world server was down or something, it took like almost 5 minutes to load into the game and then I couldn’t even hearth out for another 5, it was great.
---
So go mining/blacksmith?
---
All 3 of that (lacking, your competence and your name)
---
Yea i get that, it's just that i worry about low pop servers becoming dead servers over the next couple of years.
---
I used to do this to farmers. I would wait till they were only 2-3 hits away from killing the mob, then banish it. And repeat. Or fear to try and get more to come kill the guy. On a PVE server so, couldn't kill them, but could ruin their grind.
---
That’s why you cast sb first and while it’s traveling to the target you cast immolate so they hit at the same time
---
SC is also very good for ferals, it's not rogue specific.
---
It obviously depends on class, but if he isn't able to hold aggro in phase 1 then something is wrong because phase 1 is more or less a tank and spank phase.  If this was about losing aggro after the phase 2-3 transition it would be a different story.  
---
The slow dps in phase 1 is to control the transition from phase 2 to 3, not so the tank can just hold aggro in phase 1.  
---
And it's counterintuitive but the faster you can bring her down between phase 2 and 3 the less chaotic it is in that phase, so high dps on Ony is pretty high value.  
---
My last guild kill was sub 2 minutes, and I had a top 100 parse for my class, for whatever that's worth.
---
I mean, every DPS class that's true. Outside of raids and VERY skilled dungeon runs you will be using a lot of your kit as a tank
---
I’m embarrassed to say I’ve always been like, “wth is the blink... whatever”.  I’ve been playing mages since 07 .
---
TIL.  Thank you!!!
---
I was tanking full BRD runs at 52 as Arms.  So long as you have a quality healer, and some AoE for the torch room, you're good.
---
I just hit 39 last night and I have 50g. I’m wondering what is the most efficient way to get money for my mount. I have skinning leveled up enough to skin anything I can actually kill so I have been killing mobs of guerrillas and panthers in STV and I’d say I’m getting like 4 or 5 gold an hour. I’m a warrior if it matters. Thanks for any suggestions not advance.
---
My husband always says dorf when he means dwarf. It always reminds me of Tim Conway in Dorf on Golf.
---
It’s a tale as old as time my friend. RR and occasionally you’ll catch the same thing at the flight master in Westfall.
---
You have a full threat dump every 30 minutes! ;) As long as you "accidentally" soulstone yourself instead of your rezzer.
---
i dont get it
---
Oh it’s 100% a bot. I followed him for a few laps around this lake area. Takes the same path, kills the same mobs, and absolutely no reaction or response whatsoever if I stole his mob tags or whispered him accusing him of being a bot just to see what he’d do. Literally any reaction would have kept me from reporting. Stopping what he was doing for a moment, replying with a simple “fuck you”. Anything would’ve convinced me he wasn’t a bot. But there was nothing. Just kept going along the same programmed path no matter what I did. I’ve found quite a few alliance ones around this area, but this was the first Horde one I’ve seen so far here.
---
It's perceived as very difficult. And no, I meant full UBRS clear
---
Did anyone else read the sub rogue comment in Arnie's voice?
---
GotTA GeT MY MoUNt
---
Well in that case yes you should wait for 60 to tank it. 
---
But also we’ve dragged people as low as 55 through.  You just need to pull a couple extra packs and be careful not to get too close to the sides of the rend arena.
---
If your healer is complaining about your lifetapping, that means you're doing it too much. General rule is don't tap below half health
---
Yeah I had an issue saying I needed active game time yet I'm paid all the way through Dec.
---
100% agreed.  I'm not pissing and moaning that I think I'm entitled to it, as I understand I messed up.  Lesson most definitely learned :)
---
Funny enough, when I started playing FFXIV, I was so distraught that I HAD to wear fucking earrings that I quit the game. I got to a point where I couldn't do the main storyline (which is tied to unlocking all dungeons/raids) because my item level was too low because I refused to wear fucking earrings. 
---
When they finally put a glamour/tmog system in ffxiv, I went back and happily played.
---
If there's a group of low levels I'll kill the gnomes and leave.
---
Bear rotations are fairly easy. It's the gearing that is interesting. If you've got decent gear, tanking as a bear isn't all that hard. You \*can\* do macros and stuff to optimize a touch, but smashing the obvious buttons is like 90% of it. 
---
Plus not dancing through three groups or something ridiculous. Most players don't do that, but every now and then you get somebody who is truly creative with their fails.
---
West arathi
---
That's a choice you can make. But it's that thought process that keeps lower pop servers lower pop.

Why 31/5/15? I know for the prot. tree - but I wont be able to tank if I'm, say 31/20?
---
Look....you're already so upset that you are attempting to make a factual claim without any ability to support it. Sucks to suck there Franky.
---
You probably don't need the blink part I would think Frost nova is going to reset your global cooldown and after the second passes and your able to cast blink you would have been able to run out of melee range of the Frozen mobs.
---
If something hasn't happened to you, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  "lmao".
---
Until you try stratholme, scholomance etc.
---
Just ignore it.  Enjoy your dagger and move on with some newfound knowledge.  It's just a small amount of gold, don't sweat it.

My work gets slow in the cold seasons so I can have more time to play wow.

Too lazy.
---
My bud is a prot warrior otherwise I’d consider it.
---
Are do gains not a thing in BGs still? Asking to see if twinking still a thing we can do in classic
---
I did it at 58 after I got turned down when offering to tank scholo.
---
Alright, thought it maybe somehow made sense.
---
It's the healer who decides if the dps gets healed or dies. You just do your job.
---
Nope!
---
Contact a GM. They should be able to see that and restore the item for you
---
Lol, how convenient warcraftlogs is down atm for you so you can talk shit. When it's up go have a look and learn something, kiddo.
---
It's interesting how condescending you're being about this when the logs you're referencing themselves completely contradict the claim you're trying to make.  Hunters pull HALF of the damage that rogues and warriors do on the majority of fights + trash pulls, while only topping meters on occasion for a single fight.
---
We had this same exact argument in the private server world for *years*, so it gets tiring after a while. Just because you see results doesn't mean they correspond with reality. 
---
Private servers intentionally altered the /who function to obfuscate their populations. You could do /who a few times in a row and get accurate results (which covers 99.9% of legit use cases), but after that it would start feeding you bad data on purpose. The only reason people knew this was because the devs said so. /who is the only way to check population numbers, and you can't use a function to validate itself.
---
And even though the devs admitted that the /who function was broken, people still did the exact same shit that everyone here is doing: They constantly ran the census addon to compare different realms against each other, using a bunch of completely random numbers as if they weren't meaningless.
---
If Blizzard wanted us to have population data they would just give it to us. It would literally take 30 seconds to put it on the realm list. Clearly they don't want us to have it, **and** they went out of their way to break the /who function in a way that appears to depend on rate limiting (which is exactly what the census update confirms).
---
Can you post your logs?
---
Every caster should do at least /range 18 and only have 1 other person show up, ideally. You may not be fully utilizing the entire room available.
---
Knock "back" direction is your orientation with respect to the person targeted. So you can orient next to the caster stacked in your group to point yourself exactly in your preferred direction. This should allow casters to never be knocked directly into the melee group, for example.
---
There is some environmental Lava Splash damage that occurs throughout the fight on anyone near lava. Every raider still will want to pre pot GFPP and then pop another as that runs out - this should make the fight very clean and remove tons of pressure on all the non-tank healers.
---
Then it's simply a question of getting enough dps to pre-submerge kill to make the fight even more clean. The bar for that is actually quite low assuming there are not early deaths in the first minute or two of the fight - submerge typically only should happen when something goes very wrong, or when you are running with much fewer than 40.
---
If you can link logs I'll take a look at them in detail.
---
Assuming you have 2/2 Improved Frost Nova, something like this?
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cancelaura Ice Block
---
    /castsequence reset=21 Frost Nova, Blink
---
Seconded. I'm holy for raids, leveled and farmed early on as shadow. Once I went holy, I just raid log the toon now. Cannot solo efficiently, healers are abundant for 5 man stuff. Raid teams have 10+ healers, enough for 10+ dungeon groups, so it's not even easy getting into guild dungeon runs.
---
I'm leveling my fav, warlock, right now. Easy leveling to 50 so far. Will be good for solo grinds, pvp, free/cheap mounts. Will be my herb/miner. All my priest is really good for is mooncloth cd and fishing right now.
---
its not a political gag order. Its them not allowing their gaming tourney to be used as a political platform. Completely in their rights. 
---
If the company itself wants to take a political stand on something and address it on their platform that is completely fine. But some random dude that just won a tourney shouldn't be using Blizzard's event as a political platform. Plain and simple.
---
\&gt; Unless you have a group that understands how threat works warriors suck
---
wtf am i reading
---
\&gt;warriors suck
---
huh
---
I mean, the Marvel movies are pretty bad man. Sure, they're entertaining, but they're far from good cinema.
---
As aholy paladin you have literally the best ranged tag of any healer.

I don't have a screenshot of the exact quote. But it was his wording that made me answer my skill level.  Something like, "Is your Alchemy even maxed?" To which I reploed along the lines of "Almost. It's 288." 
---
I know ultimately I didn't have to tell him, but I wasn't expecting to get booted for that.  Ah well. Hindsight = 20/20
---
They are tall. And that means closer to heaven and the lord;)
---
I thought it was someone picking their nose
---
I just quested and ran dungeons.  Even quests that rewarded items I didn't need.  Sell those items and the loot you get from running dungeons.  I've also seen warriors offering to tank for all unneeded BoEs.  I've never done that, but it seems lucrative.
---
Grobbulus is 50/50, with stronger alliance guilds atm.
---
You don't have to do quests. Just grind. I'd be surprised if you can do WPL quests during prime time. 
---
Start doing easier parts of BRD and Dire Maul East.  With just two hours, it will be tight on time to get it done.
---
Focus on the attunement quests. You need to get this done even if you are corpse running alot.
---
Azshara is a good grind spot, especially on the beach. 
---
Silithus is good as long as it's not the elementals.
---
West Ungoro near the GY for grinding until P2.
---
Oh sorry meant rage, but although there is a fairly large difference people speak as if though deep prot builds cannot generate enough threat at all. Which isnt true if set up properly
---
It’s more like not enjoying waiting around for absolutely no good reason.
---
yea, I've learned from playing my sub spec rogue at 60 that no one wants anything other than the optimal specs for raiding which is god damn stupid but good luck convincing the raid officers of that. Their loss though, I raided all this content back in the day and could be a huge help to the raid *shrug* luckily I like leveling
---
5.  I don’t accept ninja invites
---
/cancelaura ice block
---
/cast blink
---
And 
---
/cast frost nova
---
You should have blink and frost nova separate man
---
Personally ive been prot from the second you could having no problems soloing. My healers love it a bit more as well. Im sure its all preference tho
---
Searing pain sb combo, sb shadowburn combo, deathcoil on fear immune mobs, both aoe spells, downranked lifetap/sb, healthstone which is pretty much is converted to Mana. 
---
That's slot more than 1 spell
---
There’s a few things with it:
---
1. How do they have 11% hit in tank gear? Even if they’re gearing for threat, 11% is an insane amount if you’re wearing plate/mail. 
---
2. If they’re fury/prot and mainly dual wielding it would have some benefit from the extra OH hit chance, but at what cost (see above). people mention the HS queue trick, but as a tank the micromanage would be incredibly high. 
---
3. Past 9% you can get more threat by having basically anything else but hit. Or just increase your survivability?
---
Can you show me some logs?
---
Didn't ask
---
I'm shitting on warrior tanks that tank as FURY or ARMS.
---
I'm shitting on ANY TANK that runs up and pulls 3 or 4 groups and expects the healer to just keep them up starting from half mana
---
Pull mobs to one spot. Easiest done with having ice barrier up and running past a couple mobs. Wait for them to gather up around you, or are more or less in one spot you frost nova them. If they are in a line, that is also fine, best idea is to run parallel with the line away from the mobs and wait will you are at max blizz range. When the frost nova has about 2 sec left you start to blizz the mobs. You should not do it later because it takes about a second for the blizz to actually hit the targets and apply the slow. You should place the aoe so that the mobs further back will run through the AOE and get slowed. This way the mobs that were further back are closer to the mobs in the front and are more clumped up. Once the first mobs exit the aoe area you have 2-3 sec time to re-position your blizz again. This is just enough time to do one quick hop away from the mobs, land, and cast blizz again. The mobs should be quite close to you when the second blizz ends. Frost nova should be pretty much done now or have 2-3sec in its cd. Rinse and repeat.
---
Avoid blink because it costs a lot of mana. Though if you get dazed when doing the initial frost nova then you might need to blink. Keep your mana stone up and if it looks like you messed and and can't kill them, just back off. Blink and run. They won't catch you. Then try it again.
---
You WILL NEED imp frost nova, permafrost and imp blizz. Maybe doable without imp frost nova but probably tricky.
---
Keep mana stones up and possibly a few pots in inventory.
---
Do not pull any ranged mobs. They can be dealt with but are a massive pain in the butt. Kill them separately first.
---
Why aren’t you on a pve server?
---
You sound toxic, why not just keep the tempo up?
---
Touche:D
---
That's what common sense would dictate, but they just spam aoe to gloat at their DPS. The last 3 expansions of WoW that has been the dungeon meta just aoe everything down. Maybe a lot of mages don't realize that warriors have very little in the way of serious aoe threat.
---
And having 305+ wepskill makes that 6%
---
I did this near launch, with a quest in the Barrens for a key. I asked for an invite, and they said that they were full. Mob spawned, i tagged it, suddenly a spot freed up for me. Killed it solo - if they weren't willing to help me out, why would i help them out?
---
Solo runs = hunter, also fastest leveling class as well.
---
Second account means more money for no viable reason, just ask for dungeon boost from your guildie who also is leveling an alt so you can boost his alt with your main after.
---
only 1 mage needs to have WC the rest go arcane
---
If it’s a human, they have Perception. Anything else, all I can say is that if you’re right up on them, you’ll get spotted anyway, unless you’re talented...and even then...
---
Maybe you do that becasue you are idiots?
---
None of the engi stuff is hard to get and if you're raiding you should have engi already. With just the engi stuff, chili, and oil of immolation you can outdo a paladin. The defiance talent works on all that stuff too so your threat gain is huge. Paladins will never hold a candle to a warrior.
---
I'm guessing you mean exp gains for BGs. There is no exp for BGs in Classic.
---
Are you specced into improved Blizzard? 
---
Are you using CoC? 
---
Are you wearing green "of the eagle" gear in every slot you can? 
---
Are you maxing out the range of your Blizzard casts when you frost nova the groups of mobs?
---
They made a mistake putting stupid fast mount speeds. Consider that the boot enchant gives something quite small like 8% run speed boost but was still a noticeable improvement. The mount speed increases could have increased by maybe 20% and been a significant improvement. But they doubled or tripled the speed which is absurd.
---
For terrain to feel big, it has to take a while to traverse. Traversing is boring, but sometimes things happen while you're traversing, particularly (but not exclusively) on pvp servers. So the effect of extremely fast travel is a small-feeling world, where less stuff happens.
---
Your idea for making flying mounts slower than land mounts is a good one. This means that on a land mount you can escape pvp flyers - unless the flyers are able to take terrain shortcuts. This would provide for some interesting dynamics.
---
Yes,  twinks will be back in a big way
---
Just leveling seemed efficient for me. At level 43 ish it seemed so much easier to get gold.  But that's as a warrior grinding mobs and quests solo.
---
We can go deeper.
---
I don't want to come off as entitled or being a whiner.  I fully accept responsibility for not having bagspace. That's on me.  The only thing that wasn't in my control was me being kicked from the party.
---
I mean, according to that one trailer rogues literally make themselves invisible. Seems like magic to me.
---
No, there will not be xp in BGs
---
This is why you can't find tanks. This is 100% the mages fault.
---
I see the mods are follow the same system that let /r/wow  become the cesspool that currently is: "use the downvote button durr"
---
Anyone who's paid attention to the speedrun logs for the past weeks knows that the data does not support your claim, so I don't understand where your confidence is coming from.
---
Wow, you provided evidence
---
which weps are those? :O you look sick btw :)
---
Wowhead says its phase 3 with BGs. Pretty sure  it was released in vanilla alongside AV.
---
Icy veins then. Most of the time the discord links directly to wowhead or icy veins.
---
I really liked the Scythe of Elune quest chain too for similar reasons. It's a lower level chain that starts in Ashenvale about the night elf who finds the scythe which is like the One Ring from LOTR - allowing her to amass an army of worgen to obey her only for them to slowly turn evil and act independently. It explains worgen presecens in ashenvale, felwood, and you follow her trail to Ratchet, then Booty Bay, then Darkshire, and this ties in to the origin of worgen presense in Duskwood. One of my favorite quest chains so far, but doesn't really conclude the story of the scythe and current whereabouts (though this is a usable item in later expansions i believe).
---
Rogue discord channel for more info as well as Sorrana's discord imo.  
---
From what I have read you're either PVP or PVE as a rogue.
---
This is exactly what I have always wanted.
---
That is why you do not join PUG raids. It is essentially the LFR of Classic.
---
Detect invisibles.    I play lock and I always catch rogues hiding or afk.   It’s the little things that make it enjoyable.
---
You really want to be close to the last boss level in ST, he hits like a truck and sleeps the tank. Probably would grab all the quests before going in there as well unless you want to run it a bunch for the chance at that sweet epic sword at the end.
---
As a warrior, I can agree with you that I do see some greedy warriors. I dont think it's simply people who play warriors are greedy, but the itemization required to play warrior is very time intensive and straining. And it's almost a must to gear out both tank and dps to be able to get groups, unless you're the main or off tank of a raid group.
---
As my day job, I'm a therapist, and I'll say that even if you're not wrong, your perception will not help your emotions/behaviors. I can see a greedy person and not feel compelled to rant and rave. I still perceive them as greedy, but not as the sole problem, just a small part of a bigger problem.
---
I just imagined 10 dwarfs entering moria

&gt; Who use mind vision to track down flagcarriers who are hiding in WSG. 
---
This is like my sole purpose in WSG.  However, you can't do this, if you're with the flag carrier, the distance is too far for /target. (yes Mind Vision is unlimited range, but you need to be able to target the player still.
---
Well my dumbass thought it was a shiny knee
---
Correct.  I knew this was the case as it has happened with less important items in the past.  I just destroy an item in my bags and pick up the item.  But in this case I was force-hearthed out and because I was kicked from the party, when I returned to the instance, it had reset.
---
tigerstrike is for 29 twinking
---
Bugger
---
Yes, I've heard.
---
In the future paladins can target a friendly player and cast a spell that will taunt up to three mobs attacking that player. Paladins will most likely use a Marco so it functions like a regular taunt. In addition, healing done to paladins will replenish their mana bars!
---
I dont get all this "hunters do no dps", We only have MC and hutners do very good dmg, expecially in ranged dominated fights like Baron and Shazzrah. Hunters are  always on top in the Shazzrah  fight.
---
Vanq sword looks very cool. I had it on my warrior tank only for a couple levels though until I bought a better but oridinary looking axe on the AH. Felt kinda bad vendoring the sword.
---
Not at all. There are [addons for that](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/trinket-menu).
---
This is what I’d like to do but the time I play on my server is super late and I struggle to consistently find groups even as a tank so I feel like there’s a lot of wasted down time. I have today off so I’ll probably try this for awhile while I can find groups. Thanks
---

You have no idea how many people I know think the image is like a light flicker and smoke being left behind after you blinked.

The reality is it's a Dwarf looking to the side with ["Omae wa Mou Shindeiru"/Glowing Eyes.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/glowing-eyes)
---
Fair enough, I can see why you would think that.  While I did go into it a little skeptical because of my past experiences, their was no bias here.  If you were to hear even a small sound bite of the discord you would instantly understand where I'm coming from.  I mean can the sentence, "I better not see a single dot on these mobs or warlocks get NO loot" be interpreted in any other way?
---
I switched over from swords to daggers and keep up just fine with the sword boys. But I do raid as full combat daggers. 
---
If you want to pvp as daggers you don’t need cold blood. I run a mostly sub build (for prep) and put points into combat to get 3/3 backstab, then the rest into the sin tree.

---
When Alliance coordinate on Herod, they completely own Blackrock Mountain.  I dont think it's so one-sided.
---
You’re definitely correct there lol
---
Sure as heck looks like it's supposed to be that tho. Judging from the image.
---
Ohhh rogues have a way to get out of situations like that.
---
That does not sound correct, but I don’t know enough to fully discredit it
---
You start off by immediately having a negative idea of how discord would turn out. When you look for or expect a bad experience, you’ll find one. This is a “you” problem, not raid toxicity.
---
Now the raid leader does sound cringey. However, I feel your expectations of comms lends bias to this and it may be exaggerated. I could be wrong.
---
But, in regards with how he spoke to the raid, I will defend him somewhat. Sometimes, especially with large groups, you have to treat everyone as the lowest common denominator. Most players are both extremely stupid and bad. He was doing little more than herding cats.
---
Could he have done better? Sure. Could he have been less cringey? Absolutely. Can I fault him? Sadly, not really.
---
Haha, this is wonderful.

Put Fiery on it. I believe it can proc off it.

I actually didn't realize the icons were an earring or the dwarf, so I found it interesting. Judging by the level of upvotes, it sounds like many others did as well. Would you prefer another screenshot of someone killing Rag?
---
Searing pain pulls aggro. In a typical raid the most mana efficient damage you’ll do is with corruption/ shadow bolt spam. The original comment is a debate between mage / warlock rotation, which are very similar. You start mentioning all this other utility you need to mention all the mage utility as well.

Get the Addon Questie to see available Quests on the Map/Minimap.

And yes normally most of the time you will be doing quests to level up. There is much more to the game though.

for real that shit is unplayable. what is the logic behind this layout, what are you going for here?

is your screen just big as fuck?
---
&gt; warriors can push 1k+ dps on most bosses.
---
They can't in pahse 1.

Also no way a warrior is topping the meter in Shazzrah.

Mining allows you to smelt bars not blacksmithing.
---
They have nothing better to do.

Your secon professions up to you
---
All hybrids were designed to be healers in raid content in Vanilla.
---
2H-Arms is the superior choice for PvP. Get a pair of Stronghold Gauntlets so you have "Immune to Disarm" and then enchant your weapon with Crusader.
---
Its ok for tanks, I would think, but of course the flask is better...strength is good for tps and block for warriors, and then they can use mongoose too.
---
Is it a consumable? 99.9% chance you cannot use it in form

Is it chance on hit weapon? Nope

Is it chance on hit trinket? Yup

As far as I know this is generally true.

Just die above Gnomeregan and spawn at starter area

You're a true hero in my heart

If you are running the instance with them - 50g
---
if the instance is already cleared and you just need to click the horsey - 75g
---
Reference: Herod - Horde.
---
Your client isn't suppose to be capable of revealing enemy buffs under any circumstances
---
It kind of sucks but paladin makes up for it by ret being the sickest pvp spec by far.
---
She even has the Silverwing Battle Tabard which you get from Exalted with the WSG faction. :)
---
Yeah exactly, thanks!
---
Bringing a druid tank or healer is like hiring someone with only an associate's degree for an office job
---
If they have experience in the field it's perfectly fine, you're just being weirdly picky by demanding more
---
Sheeps on majordomo are basically the exact same thing aren't they?
---
&gt; I won't go back with any dps that isn't 60
---
Just dont take hunters.
---
I'm 53 and still running Mara for that damn ring.
---
For now yes you’re just going to quest but soon you can start doing instances and imo the game gets like a million times more fun
---
Yup for me the most profitable transmute I have is life to earth.. so in my case it's Days until paid off = Cost of pattern / (Cost of water - Cost of undeath - Cost of earth + Cost of Life)
---
EVEN THE LYNX FEET, love the dedication in of your xmog :) Looks great!
---
brd is amazing xp for mages and people in groups with mages
---
do the starting 2 loops, hit arena and kennel if you want, repeat
---
You know everyone is able to mark targets? Or is this new to you and/or too much work or maybe you're a little too shy to take the lead?
---
Im sorry for being a little sarcastic there but for real, were replaying history here.   You don't have to wait till the end of this documentary to know how it'll end is all I'm sayin.
---
I was a big fan of rogues and hunters at 19. Rogues were strongest at 19 though by far. 
---
I think hunters were a bit stronger lvl 29 and warriors were pretty good there too.

---
I don't think this makes sense since you don't get honor for killing people with 40 level difference.
---
Yeah and I know it’s silly but I really want that mount right at 40.
---
You might be right, but it sure seems to work when I buff it as lock.   I guess I’m just very lucky seeing stealth players.
---
1. Undead Strat - Groups are tightly packed and there are a lot of patrols that can cause issues. The final two bosses hit hard and the waves of mobs in between them can catch people off guard. Most things are un cc-able without a priest or hunter.
---
2. DM:West - I consider west and north equally as tough. West has some undead mobs that cant be reliably CCd and some silence, mana burn, and do a lot of AoE damage. If your group isn't effective in target killing or you dont have a strong healer, you could be in for a ride. Bosses are easy.
---
3. DM:North - Some mobs in North hit hard, but everything is cc-able and relatively straight forward. Plus, you can skip a lot of mobs.
---
4. Scholo - The mobs themselves arent super difficult, but like UD Strat, they are tightly packed and have some patrols that can cause sticky situations. Most are undead so some cc is unreliable. A few boss fight rooms can be rough depending on your group composition. Examples are having a full melee group against the shades that are immune to physical damage, or the room with 100 zombies if you have no AoE.
---
5. UBRS - Fairly easy. Some mobs hit hard, but if you cc properly nothing should be a problem. Bring 2 healers for easy mode.
---
6. Live Strat - Unlike undead, you can cc most mobs in here. The mobs are fairly spaced apart and none hit too hard. Beware of undead patrols spawning behind you as you go through and you should be ok. Bosses are the easiest of all these dungeons.
---
It's been posted several times by several people thinking they are original and that others care they dinged 60.
---
Druids are highly underrated...
---
What? I am not even sure where to start.
---
1. Ret is a viable dps spec - no it is not, don't even try and say it's viable. It is straight up garbage.
---
2. If pallys could tank just delete druids - Both classes just like every class in classic have their own spells and abilities and bring something unique to dungeons and raids. Why would you delete a class just because another is better? Than why do we have rogues when Fury warriors out DPS them in raids?

---
Yeah... the tanks going to love when you cast searing pain. None of those will net you more dps than straight corruption/ shadowbolt. Throwing in a deathcoil or shadow burn after casting 20+ shadow bolts will not move your overall dps much.
---
Not for a long time dude. It's really bad dps right now when compared to combat.
---
It can definitely outperform some other classes, but it definitely won't outperform combat or _any_ warrior spec.
---
I really regret rolling warrior. As someone who can’t dedicate as much time as I did the first month after launch, and with all my friends having quit/having trouble finding a guild, this game has been on hardmode. My dps is great, the class is a blast, but my only choices are pugs, can’t find heals willing to help me out, and can’t solo just about anything in the world worth farming. Great class. But without a good guild, it just feels very frustrating.
---
I’m just not spec for tank plus I’m average at best at it so I feel like a punk trying to charge people for my tanking but I have considered it

thx for your service mate
---
You only need 1 mage with WC.
---
The rest go Arcane for that massive damage boost.
---
if you have disenchanting at least you get shards
---
I love pvp. I play with about 15 buddies I know in real life. We just do random thing but we’re on discord shooting the shit and it’s fun. 
---
It really just comes down to what you find fun. I attack horde on sight at brd while my buddies are tryna run in and more so want the gear while I want the high tempo fights and then I’ll hop in and laugh as they camp a friend lol 
---
Stupid shit like that just makes it fun for me
---
Not really a battle. More like a slideshow
---
Was the other guy's comment removed for attacking others and not being civil/respectful?
---
There’s literally nothing you need Druids for except that it’s a viable off tank. Nothing. Raids could exist entirely without them. Take them out as the only viable off tank spec and they have no use. 
---
Yes Ret is viable. And if you think fury warriors replace rogues dps wise you clearly haven’t raided much.
---
True, but in groups I find it extremely fun. Priest is the most fun healing class, solo just is tough/takes a lot of mana.
---
Sell the axe and heal

It dropped a lot of the fun and situational awareness out for me. I am however, enjoying my shaman in classic-- much more than I have in years.
---
Yeah it’s incredibly inefficient
---
Or they're a sociopath who reckons they can increase profit margins by harassing strangers.  Words are free!
---
Crazy. I'm glad I never payed attention to that stuff back in Vanilla when I was young, crazy, and actually had the free time. Now, I'm a busy adult human and don't have the time to actually fall into the pit of despair that would be grinding out pvp ranks lol   
---
Great recap too, my dude
---
You’re definitely right in the only thing holding us back is the stigma. Patch 1.2 saw dire bear form 125% armor to 360%. We were literally garbage before that and the stigma sticks to this day.
---
Yup 10% faster than any other faction.
---
The 200 AP from tribute, 120 AP from ony head and the 40 AP from juju might are all melee-only.
---
Understandable! It makes the game a lot more enjoyable.  Good luck.

lol, another naive and uninformed baddie rogue. Keep living in a bubble while we actually have the stats of over 10k raid logs.
---
You can probably get into ring of law runs at 52, angerforge closer to 53-54, and further in the higher your level.
---
Sometimes it's nice to group with someone but there's also added pressure when doing so. It can often mean slowing down your questing if they don't go at the same pace or in the same way as you. For one quest it can be nice if it's difficult but don't be offended by I say thanks and leave at the end.
---
But sometimes I'm just in the mood to zone out and do some leveling on an alt, which means I'm not in the mood to socialize. Some days you're just too tired and want to do your own thing.

I used chili's fairly liberally in the late 30s, early 40s. At the time, they were 25s or less, and thus had a fairly decent cost/benefit ratio. They're higher now, and they also are less important as you get into higher dungeons. So, I've slacked some. 
---
But they're certainly not necessary. Mostly it's about what kind of experience you want. Using consumes can make a run a bit more pleasant. Not bad in moderation, though of course gold is always a concern.

Most trinkets have very long CDs, so just have your best 2 equipped at all times and whenever those are on CD switch them out for another 2.

 SHAMAN:

 **Ele:** Third version of a Boomie. This one doesn´t change the appearance or color but is just as terrible. Maybe even more so. But it is fun for those sweet 14 seconds till you deplete your mana pool. Then just run around and pretend that you are doing something very useful.   
---
so true xD  
---
But u still can pull your weapon and charge for normal hits and pretend better
---
I mean no, that's literally what the best mages do as well in raid.
---
Sorry bro maybe next time we can discuss proc rates
---
Well, it will be impossible for me not to say this in my head everytime now. And I'm fine with that. Thank you.
---
Oh that's not our MT who is like that. I'm the MT for our guild heh. That guy who took sulfuras as a prot warr, he's the MT / RL for the other big raiding guild on our server. We're getting new applicants from that guild asking to join ours daily. They just hemorraged 37 players that formed their own guild rather than deal with that guys bullshit lol. I'm the guild master for our guild, and I would not stand for the kind of BS that I see some pulling.

if he's talking to them like they are children...

maaaaaaybe its because, like children, they don't listen

no changes

you do realize its a satirical content, right?
---
The nice thing about reserving the first orb is that 0-1 orbs is pretty common. It's a much higher percentage of orb drops than it sounds like, over multiple runs.
---
A couple from this past week. 
---
First: the level 56 hunter that requests healer assistance in guild chat in order to finish his BRD key quest. We get a guild group together to help him out and HoJ drops off angerforge. Yay tank, right? Wrong. The hunter needs it as well and wins the roll. Then proceeds to AFK through golem because his "weed guy" has arrived. 
---
He proceeds to show up as we are fighting Ambassador, train us with mobs and wipe the group. After being called out for his douchebaggery he /gquits and hearths out. True class.
---
Second: Running an UBRS to help a couple of guildies finish ony attunement alongside a couple other non-guild players. Things are going smoothly up past Rend. Then we have a couple of people drop group. It's fine there's still 8 of us, couple healers couple tanks. The beast is hard, couple folks die but we win. Path to Drakk is hard as fuck, tank does a clue times but otherwise smooth sailing. 
---
We wipe to deal but we get a Divine Intervention out on one of the non-guild pallys, who then proceeds to click it off and hearth out of the dungeon without rezzing anybody. Just ups and leaves after being saved. 
---
We were able to get a replacement along with a couple of DPS and finish but I mean wow. Absolute asshats.
---
Yea icy veins is very good
---
You’re correct: the amount of time needed is entirely determined by other people in your faction
---
If your faction is playing super casually, you can get a good placement on the ladder without playing a lot. But... corollary is that if everyone in your faction is playing hardcore, you can hit a plateau even at rank 11 if you don’t play crazy amount of time.

---
Go prot at 55. Do BRD till 57, LBRS till 58. Strat/Scholo till 60. UBRS at 60. 
---
Probably throw some DM in there too
---
Why is that anything but a positive? Buy it and sell for a 190g profit.
---
Eh. My guild is a bunch of guys that have been together since launch. We're just now finally filling out our 40 man. Been having to pug the last 10-15 slots last couple weeks. Not always a negative thing.
---
The biggest complaint I have as a healer, and god bless the tanks because I'm sure they feel the same way, is that most DPS from PuGs I've ever had the pleasure of running dungeons with only care about out-do'ing each other on the damage meters, and tend to see "top of the meter" as a valid strategy/win for that dungeon.   
---
I don't know if retail has ruined them, or if they don't know any better - or maybe even just don't care. Upon pulling, DPS always starts immediately and at full throttle. It's rare that a tank even has literally one second to try and establish aggro. It's just a mess. DPS need to learn to attenuate their DPS to the circumstance, and understand that topping a meter isn't necessarily the pinnacle of being a DPS class. Being good at DPS doesn't mean always topping the meters; being a good DPS also means knowing when not to and knowing how to use your kit.
---
Thankfully, I mostly run dungeons with guildies wherein the DPS knows how to behave.
---
By full resto, do you literally mean 51 points in resto?
---
Not true, Randy Marsh is a human hunter level 2. 
---
In the outside world he’s a simple geologist but in WoW, he is Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. He has braved the Fargo Deep Mine, and defeated the Blood Fish at Jarod's Landing...
---
If you look at the bottom of the who window it shows the search parameters. Typicaly when you type /who it opens the window with search parameters for your current zone and +-5 from your current level. You can modify these and refresh to get different results. I don't know if it lists everyone that fits the parameters, some random subset of them.
---
Also a hunter spell

I always saw the face but never noticed the beard

That's not true, my guild name got removed because it wasn't RP. "Some kinda AOE", and had to be changed.
---
Also, Goldshire is a ghost town whenever I check.
---
Don’t turn it into a 2nd job; I play games to relax and unwind, not stress out about keeping up with everyone else.  The reward is the journey, not the destination.
---
Regardless, people will just check your gear in capital city instead of on armory. You cant avoid elitist jerks just by not having armory.
---
This was in response to "Classic+". So if they did do something. That's about as far as I would go.
---
I mean..it's either Classic+ or just TBC...then Wrath...then Cata..on up to "one expansion before Retail". With the likelihood that they just release another round of 'Classic Servers'; basically a very long Groundhog Day. Should the 'current expansion' not end before the next 'expansion cycle'
---
((I highly doubt a Classic+ will happen. They'll do the above and just try to keep things afloat while hoping "this expansion" brings people back [to Retail]. Sad times...))
---
It’s worse when you land in the lava, but it’s shallow enough that the fall damage still hits you and you die.
---
Counterspell is best spell.
---
Well yes, as a human I use context clues to piece together my reality.  The raid chat before joining discord gave me enough context to formulate an expectation.  My expectation turned out to be in line with reality.
---
Is this not something you do?
---
Cx
---
I'm a human Warlock so I get perception and detect invisibility (whether it works or not).  Not sure you run into this but if I hear a stealtlh sound I toss a couple random AOE's around as well to see if I root anything out.
---
Are we sure lockout timer is actually 5 and not "effectively" 4? I get locked out of Mara averaging 12 min runs + 2 min alt reset, which made me start thinking about it
---
Aren't you still "tagged" to an instance until you're out of it? So if I start Mara at 00 and reset at min 12 and repeat 12 min runs ie
---
1. 00-12
---
2. 12-24
---
3. 24-36
---
4. 36-48
---
5. 48-1:00
---
The sixth would in theory be 1:00-1:12, but at 1:01 I'm still locked to the first instance I was in because I didn't leave it for another 11 minutes. So I would be locked to six instances at the same time. Sure, you can do 5 dungeons in the first hour, but if you're grinding for multiple hours, you can't do more than 4
---
Lol at "shield mitigation doesn't matter"
---
Put a shield on and marvel at never stopping for healer mana.
---
yeah, drop that windfury totem and smash it hard.
---
Nah, that's the real deal.  No transmogs here.
---
What server is this? Sounds like someone I've pugged with.
---
I will chime in on the Demonforged Breastplate. GET IT ASAP. It scales with +healing and procs like mad when you have 10 lashers hitting you at the same time. It is costly, but it is a much worthier investment than the skullflame shield which is quite sub-par to be honest (from personal experience).
---
19 is popular because it's the easiest/ quickest,  rogues are by far the most popular.
---
Our warlock tanks phase 3 ony sometimes.  Pretty easy to keep alive too..
---
I plan on pushing for it too, I only hit rank 8 in vanilla, but I was primarily raiding and twinking when raids weren't happening.
---
Well Arcane power, frost is by far the best dps specc for raids.
---
"Speak Friend and Enter"
---
LOLNOOBS!
---
You gonna enter a login que then choose your account if you got multiple and then lose connection.
---
Being able to detect people beyond your normal line of sight seems like cheating to me.
---
Because my idea of fun includes pvping in the open world. If you’re going to type “getting camped is part of it” I’ll save you the keystrokes, I don’t care. Most people who play on pvp servers love pvp, it’s the only reason I’m back in classic is to pvp. Although apparently I have to love being unable to play the game for days on end because “lol u rolled on a pvp server u deserve it hehehe xD”
---
You won’t need subtlety to do the pick pocket runs. If you’re level 60 you can stand basically right in their face and not pull mobs lol only thing you need to watch for is a pickpocket resist
---
I skipped Scholo and LBRS entirely.
---
It's definitely not all ranged. You pop a greater arcane protection potion. Pop Recklessness, Death Wish, and whatever other cooldowns you have, and the boss dies before the first teleport. Look at logs for Shazzrah, all the top damage are warriors. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Arms sucking in raids has a lot more to do with the awful dps than the debuff.
---
It's a burst spec.
---
Strange. I though if you have cash to buy gold, but don't have time to farm, you are not loser. Your logic isn't perfect
---
Yeah, I'm level 35 and still using my Cruel Barb and another drop from SFK because I don't feel like paying AH prices or zerging Gnomer for a better weapon. Having the same swords for 15 levels sure doesn't feel like rewarding gameplay to me.
---
Anyone else kind it odd that in a flurry of being stabbed and slashed at, the thing that actually interrupts the spell is a simple kick?
---
Warriors can keep shield block up 100% of the time to push crushing blows off the table. Paladins depend on holy shield plus redoubt for the same effect, the latter of which only triggers when the Paladin is crit. You can go without redoubt, but you need significantly more defence than a warrior.
---
That's not even considering the lack of taunt or the mana management issues. With a raid that knows how paladins work and are willing to help the tank out it might be possible, if difficult. Your average pug isn't going to cross this threshold.
---
I love pally tanking, but vanilla/classic is not the time to go all in on it. I'm willing to wait till BC for my time in the sun.
---
This makes so much fucking sense holy shit....
---
Google 'Mage' levelling guides! There are a ton out there and are very informative. My RL buddy just started a couple weeks ago and I recommended he do the same thing - Now he's higher lvl than I am. [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide) is a good place to start. Make sure to look into AOE farming!
---
TBH it was one of those icons that I never took a close look at. But there's a few like that. Blood Fury has an icon that I never really looked closely at.
---
I wish I could get pets, hugs, and aggressive cuddles from a big kitty.
---
Yeah I have a bunch of anecdotal evidence from old wow forum posts saying to expect a 30% chance of misfire... thats.... a lot....
---
you joke but hunters are the only ones who will/can make use of this sword throughout the entire game. With this sword a hunter can chase druid Flag carriers in WSG. I'd honestly tell a warrior to go fuck himself if he wants it, once he gets a raid weapon this thing is going in the bank. Period.
---
You can't use items from your inventory while shapeshifted, (potions, etc.) But you can use items that you have equipped.  Like the manual crowd pummeler, pvp trinket, etc.
---
You can go whatever spec you like just make sure you're getting 5/5 defiance and points into sunder. The new hotness is going 0/31/20.
---
idk worked for me
---
Same lol
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, don't all surviving players run up to check the loot as soon as the boss is dead?
---
You have to press it multiple times.
---
I get pretty excited when I get invites that way too! I'm always down to run any dungeon though.
---
I went prot at 52 and spammed BRD looking for HOJ and chain until 60, it was quite boring, so only do it if you are ok with grinding the same stuff over and over. I think I got ~60-70 runs in before I hit 60.
---
I've joined it on occasion. It's fairly quiet on my server, so I don't think it's of much value. Again, I don't think anyone seriously looking for a dungeon group is in /world but not /LookingForGroup.
---
Resto is not mentioned in leveling guides because it is not an optimal way to level. It slows down your kill times in solo questing by a lot. Not many people level in their dungeon specs.
---
Is there a resource out there that would show AH prices across realms? I know the economy is exclusive to each realm, but with things like BoE items, if there isn’t one posted I never know how much to sell it for. So I either list it too high repeatedly and waste deposit gold or sell it way too low and miss out
---
Yeah, I've never not seen it as a earring.
---
Sounds amazing! We have a addon ready for this part, but You have to uploade a file to us like warcraftlogs, but we’re trying to figure out a smart Way to do this!
---
I may have accidentally made a click-baitey title.  I did not mean to assign it to the whole community, I know there are good guilds out there.  I just wondered if others run into this as frequently as I seem to.
---
Thanks!  Should save time on my alt....too late for my main!
---
agreed most are in both. on Herod /world is crazy
---
You miss out on nightfall as well snd succubus is rather poor for SL.
---
humm maybe when i did it they guards hadn't respawned. well, my bad :D
---
Nice work on the leggings of the fang ;) and talbar mantle!
---
Looking for some advice/suggestions.
---
On my server, all the organized raiders raid at almost the same time. I have not been able to find a single group that has raids that fit my schedule (anytime on weekdays between noon-8pm server time, which is Eastern Time if that matters). 
---
I could spend many hours trying to farm 5 man dungeons, but even at the end of all that, I'd still have way worse gear than someone who spends a few hours a week in an MC farm guild
---
and that (gear discrepancy) is a fairly big deal on a PVP server, which I am on.
---
If I could, I'd transfer servers (surely there must be at least a few guilds on all the servers combined that raids within that 40-hour block of time), but of course that isn't an option. At least not right now. 
---
I guess I could re-roll. I hate to lose all the progress, but I wonder if that'd be my best option. Anyone have any advice?
---
okay cool, that all makes sense to me. Thanks for taking the time to reply, this is all good information.  Sounds like I need to be looking at getting my +hit up with eleven rings and saytrs bow,  and then do a bunch of UBRS for basically everything else; shield, girdle, legs, shoulders etc. while I wait to for raid to form. My irl priest friend still wants to do a bunch of Scholomance still so perhaps i can grab those bloodmail boots there too for more hit.
---
I love that movie. One of my favorites. Unfortunately it's probably getting so old now that this meme is completely lost on a lot of the zoomers in this sub.
---
I prefer to squeeze my hog to some hot grill cosplay Kreygasm
---
Are you using Vanish while having a DoT (Damage over Time) on you? If a warlock puts a curse on you, or a Warrior puts a bleed on you and you Vanish, as soon as it damages you again, it'll take you out of Stealth
---
People train that? Flametongue and Windwall totems are still sitting untrained and I've been 60 since week 2 lol
---
Question: 
---
How can I assign target markets to mobs in dungeon using my bars instead of right clicking enemies? 
---
I'm guessing there's a macro command?
---
I had a twink rogue at 29 and a twink hunter at 39.  I don't like the 19 bracket because I don't feel like I have enough abilities.
---
 very helpful, thx!
---
oh nice. is that 9 stacks of each wool or more?
---
Have your melees bring gapp pots and thats going to change.
---
Not true in the least; Spy mod is proof enough of that. You're talking out your ass.
---
Right because trying to farm mats as an ally just leads to being camped in epl 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
"Wow these bugs are coming from this zone that we named after the bugs"
---
oof, that 13 minute break before the last message. Maybe the saddest part of this whole thing
---
I doubt that. Any one in the raid can view the items on the corpse, even in master loot. So I don’t think it would be left behind.
---
"Odd groups go to the left. Even groups go to the right. That means groups 1, 3, 5, 7, left. 2, 4, 6, 8 right. 7 and 8 are on whelps"
---
"You are going to dps very very slowly"
---
"Throw more dots, more dots, more dots. Okay, no more dots"
---
I wouldn't mind being able to play wow from my phone, my work productivity would drop through the floor but I could grind up alts so much faster
---
Ony buff is melee AP only
---
Weapons is a no. U use ur paws not the weapon
---
Moon is the universal sheep marker.
---
Lol what did everyone think it was?
---
I think Snipedaddy is trying to emphasize how much of an impact the net can have on a single fight. I know as a shaman, 1 crit every 50 spells is not bad, but a good PVPer is not going to let me free cast. If I could choose to root an opponent that relies on distance or guarantee a crit, it's always going to be the root. If I am unable to cast a single spell that requires cast time, I'm probably not going to win.
---
You should also look in to an addon to swap trinkets. In your scenario, if you are maximizing your gear, you should Net for 1/10 fights and %2 crit for 9/10 fights. Obviously that's on paper and practicality changes things.
---
You cared enough to comment. :)
---
The answer is no. There were at least 400-500 people total and everything was unplayable. Still a ton of fun but the servers were definitely starting to fail.
---
Jeez, can't people enjoy something without wanting something else....
---
I am glad you are not neglecting flushing out carbon dioxide out of your body.
---
Mate those are two of the most valuable keys you can use, yet you claim they're frequently unbound. I'd definitely change that habit asap. Like the other dude said, i use mousewheel click for my interrupt and shift mousewheel click for similar stutf
---
I (dps) left a ZF group after getting what I wanted, a Ghrazilla kill. Hey, it was 4am.
---
For me, it's friends, just like any other game be it online or in real life.  I'm pretty poor in game because, although I'm a Warlock, I can only grind out princess or drop runs for about an hour before I get bored and look for something else...  but if my buddy's online, I can happily grind out our lowbie alts for 12 hours straight and wonder where my day went.
---
Story wise, no I haven't done it this time around.  I'd probably quite enjoy a full group playing in story mode, with some over the top dungeon master style narration and some RP actions in game, but I don't have those kinds of friends.   That's Ok though, we have fun playing as we do.
---
This can’t be real .
---
They dont scale with gear as well as other classes. So they will fall behind relative to other classes as further phases come out
---
Only thing left; pull the boss.
---
And then do it again.
---
Yes.
---
Can't speak to the other classes, but the resto druid prebis list is completely garbage. Like, so many things are not even close to the best available.
---
Nah, flying was one of the best parts of BC.
---
Probably both
---
I understand you use the word "generally" really awful. But I still don't see how filling in missing spots with pugs correlate with a guild being bad. Sometimes finding people to fit a raid schedule is simply really hard and there is a lot of cases of people simply not showing up for no reason and come up next raid asking for an invite. Its not an issue of people leaving due to poor raiding/guild control, but its just people being busy or selfish sometimes. Its easy to get 40 raid ready people, but about 15-20 of that 40 will actually show consistently for raids. I do believe guilds treat pugs differently sometimes and that is definitely not good. Pugs can be an opportunity for more guild members.  I believe it is important to treat pugs nicely and show them appreciation for sharing a weekly ID with your guild. I just don't believe resorting to pugs to give current guild members a raiding opportunity while the guild grows doesn't mean a guild is bad
---
Willem Dafoe got a shit character with bad writing but he did the best he could
---
You can’t have it all. Succubus is just fine for turret dps. You can also spec Nightfall if you want to.
---
I’m not trying to say SL is better turret dps than destro, just that it usually works just fine.
---
Duh. 
---
If it takes 30 seconds before the tank picks it back up, you wipe. We have tanks popping recklessness and a mighty rage pot and still can’t get it back. But sometimes she lands and goes straight for the tank.
---
 There’s a threat mechanic going on that is not yet understood that is different than vanilla. In vanilla, her aggro reset when she landed.
---
That's the first 10 levels of classic hunters and it sucks.
---
Or without the range dead zone you would just point blank mobs with your bow which sounds silly.
---
In retail you can do just this with the lone wolf talent.
---
I expect the reset part will incorrectly lock out the nova in that case. I expect just a simple /cancel /cast /cast should work, though it'll print/play the can't cast message when nova's down.
---
Rogues in pvp: cc,cc,cc,cc
---
Rogues in PVE: what? cc, but my damage meter
---
anyway i try to cc everything in dungeons
---
and by cc i mean pick pocket
---
Wow it scales with +healing? Are you sure it's +healing or is it +spell damage?
---
That uncentered minibar is giving me more anxiety than any game I have ever played.
---
Tribute and Ony buffs are not melee only AP. Also you cannot stack scorpok salt with roids. They share buff slot and will override each other.
---
Now take into account that literally none of these especially juju farming is necessary for MC. Almost nobody is farming this unless the whole raid is going for some kind of server top 10 list.
---
I was never arguing top potential damage but the reality of current raid dps. Which is warriors topping the fights they can stick in melee at but hunters doing more dps across the full raid because of previously mentioned examples
---
If he tops the meters in mc and he is oom he is overhealing a lot or the rest of the healers are giga bad
---
Someone once said he died because he hit a rock in the lava
---
I will kindly disagree with you on this point.  I'll also add, this strategy failed in this scenario as our group wiped and fell apart.
---
Spy mod pulls from the combat log, which means it can only get data within a very short radius around you.
---
I'm not sure how you think that extends to the entire world...
---
To be fair Scorpio sting has a little more sparkle to it but other than that exactly the same hahaha
---
Flying was a major selling point to that expansion and was also necessary to reach certain parts of zones. Plus, it was expensive to get the 60% mount, let alone the 280%.
---
Lmao!
---
Find a guild, you always overexplain in pugs because you have new players
---
No. Because Hand of Antu'sul is a mace, it's "Chance on hit" proc refers to "Chance on [this weapon's] hit." When you're in form, you're not hitting with your weapon, you're hitting with your paws, so it doesn't trigger the weapon's "on hit" effect. 
---
Compare to Hand of Justice, which reads "2% chance on melee hit to gain 1 extra attack." The key term here is "melee hit" not "weapon hit" so your paws count.
---
I always liked survival
---
Yup, they have to sneak past the mobs since they'll be aggressive to any new people entering the instance, but if they reach the end they can get the buffs.
---
My guild does a DM run about an hour before MC/Ony, and anyone can just join at the end for free buffs.
---
This coming from the guy who said rogues should be able to use 2 handers. I’m sure this isn’t a troll post at all
---
Look, another arm chair game designer.
---
I thought the same thing.
---
People have been posting about dinging at chromie since 2 weeks after the game came out. Considering she is a quest giver in WPL you have a pretty relevant chance at dinging by one of her quests.
---
This isn't to hate on your post, just giving you some context on why people might be treating you negatively.
---
Also, I dinged on Chromie and thought it was pretty cool myself. Grats on 60.
---
Yeah, I assume the more meme servers have some crazy shenanigans going on. My server is often regarded as the "dad server", plus I'm on Alliance. There isn't nearly as much dumb drama or shitposting in global channels.
---
Aww sounds like someone’s little feelings are hurt
---
I ran a full BRD clear for a couple guildies last night, a 50 warlock and 55 priest.  They both still had weapons from SM for the same reason.  At least Emp dropped the healer staff for the priest!
---
Seems like a bad redo of the weird Al  parody that's the world of Warcraft that you play.
---
Two-step it, eating/healing to full between. It's much safer.
---
https://www.bootybaygazette.com/ Does exactly this. It's a paid service though.
---
They don’t really need to cast, though.
---
I was just there few minutes ago, are you talking about the gobelin inside the engineering house, just on the right of the inn ?
---
I see princess runs mentioned a lot, what are they and why are they so good?
---
That’s awesome but ... how do I count six in deadlines? 
---
I thought just 5
---
Really? My last line wasn't enough? Alright then: you've been r/whoosh -ed.
---
Bonus points for the irony of you replying to clear satire with "wtf brah, u not get mah satire?!"
---
&gt; why does your sword skill matter?
---
cuz he's out of arrows(or will be very shortly)  
---
he was joking that he would soon would be a melee hunter
---
I have never really enjoyed raiding (mostly due to the massive amount of downtime they inevitably have for stupid unnecessary shit + your complaint) and so I have not tried to raid very much in my wow career. I've probably attempted maybe 10 total usually because there was just something I really wanted (so yes I'm the pug) and I'd say about half the time there is toxic talk happening. I just leave immediately since I don't enjoy it to begin with and it refreshes my memory of that reason to not attempt raiding again. 
---
Last Saturday I had a BRD group dps bail because he had to go for something, but we were literally on Emp. So our healer had a raid geared fury warrior friend come help finish. He ended up being such an elitist asshole for like no reason at all. It left me speechless. I mean we didn't even have to do anything but kill a boss and he found time to be an ass. 
---
So in my experience, raiders tend to lean towards being dicks. Maybe because they take the game WAY more seriously than I do. Not sure.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Spy just parses your combat log. /who functionality has nothing to do with that.
---
&gt;Prot pally gets no ~~love~~ taunt D:
---
Killing people  
---
I pretty much refuse to play with skinners. I wind up killing all the mobs and they're still skinning. Gets really old.
---
i always thought it was a cloud of aether with a star in it.
---
Rag phase 2? Ony welps? Axe throwers in zg? Decurse??? Not to mention fire blast and coc will significantly increase your dps if you have mana to support it. 
---
But you’re right, the best mages just afk frostbolt all raid
---
He’s talking about disenchanting bop’s. Can’t do that through the trade window.
---
item is garbage due to high fail rate
---
Hopefully all of your mages minus one are showing up to raid with Arcane Power rather than Ice Barrier
---
Then why will phase 2 change anything?
---
What’s your shadow priest gonna do? Go out into the open arms of all the other guilds begging for shadow priests?
---
Are you sure he isn't just exploiting being a Gnome who can literally fit under that building... LOL
---
Yea i saw that earlier today when searching some pvp stuff. That seems so busted for warriors!
---
Are there any notable items or abilities that act as exceptions to this, or does it really give you immunity to all stuns and movement impairments? I imagine there aren't many classes that could last 30 seconds with a warrior in a 1 on 1 at least without some way to create space.
---
I think that says more about how bad your Rogues and Warriors are
---
No its a guy with a single eye going "hmmm"
---
The only time Alliance has control of BRM is when Tempest comes around, and they purposely avoid Bipolar and Storm.
---
I actually think its good game design. The unique aspects of every class is reflective of what an RPG should be imo. That is how Dungeons and Dragons works. Not every class should be able to perform each role.
---
What the fuck is up with all these visual vomit UIs lately???
---
&gt;but how are you beating your warriors?
---
Not him, but my experience is a combination of threat, our raids not running strats that truly benefiting fury warriors, and honestly all of our fury warriors kinda being hot garbage.
---
And then tbc comes out and Hunter is best in game.
---
B tier but incredibly easy to farm compared to some other bis pieces.
---
He sounds like an asshole, and there are far better ways to handle idiots then treating them like children. A little respect can go a long way.
---
That said, if you assume incompetence you will be right far more than you'll be wrong...
---
Yeah crap, I mean who doesn't just kick ass in a 4 v 1 scenario. Careful your insecurities are showing little tough guy.
---
My wife's favorite thing to do is buff people. For over a decade she's always on top of it. She got pregnant shortly after classic dropped and man..... its like that whole part of her brain went on vacation.
---
We'll be questing and I'm like "ahem....." then in dungeons and I'm like "aHEM cough........." then we get to the boss and I'm like "AHEM.............................................................cmonbabeimarogueandeventhemagegavemearcaneintellectpleasegivemefortitude"
---
She is so lucky she isn't a Paladin.
---
I really don't get this mentality... Why play pvp at a low level when max level pvp is so much better? Twink a 60 that's what the best part of wow really is
---
NO QUIT
---
[ONLY HIT](https://i.imgur.com/q46L4QH.jpg)
---
Net is good to prevent the enemy from kiting you, not just to stop melee from getting to you. For example net is a top tier trinket vs hunter, and one of the backfires (net both, pull you to target) can actually be better than the normal use.
---
I was with a guildy running DM nort tribute. Me as a tank with only 3% extra hit. I really wanted the +hit ring from the chest, but he rolled and won. He already had one of those rings + blackstone ring (which also gives hit)
---
Druids for WSG flag runners are popular. Warlocks for fear locking. Priests for pocket healers. Hunter/rogue for solo flag defending ability. Warriors for plate and arms crits and that decreased healing debuff.
---
Basically play whatever sounds fun to you.
---
My guildies are going lvl 49 twinks... Because they are insane. But you can also get really good gear by then and have all the best moves learned.
---
No, it’s the children who are wrong
---
No joke, it's rough!
---
I've been doing DM:East Jump runs with a Warrior and usually 1 other random DPS and we disenchant all of the green/blue loot drops. The disenchant value tends to be higher than the vendor sell value for them so it's definitely worth considering even for higher level dungeon farming.
---
Okay, well, setting aside the various costs of these, what are the options for PC gaming without Windows? Generally, I think you can define three:
---
1. MacOS. In the case of WoW and other Blizzard games, this isn't a problem since they run natively, but there are a lot of games that don't work with MacOS natively.
---
2. Linux or MacOS using Wine/Proton/some other compatibility layer. Again, for a game like WoW which could run on a modern toaster, this isn't a problem, but games aren't guaranteed to work, you may have to mess with configuration and extra helper packages and whatnot, and you will take a performance hit.
---
3. Linux using a VM with a passthrough (something like Hyper-V and PCI-E passthrough). This will get you much closer to native performance and full compatibility, but is definitely a pain to setup. It can require compiling things from source, mapping hardware components such as sound and video cards using unique identifiers (by manually searching for them with shell commands), and may just straight-up not work at all depending on your combination of kernel version/features/hardware/driver versions. And of course, maintaining the setup can be a pain and involve a lot of these steps again as well.
---
All of these are opposed to Windows, which, for all of its flaws, generally "just works" with games. You install Battle.net/Steam/Epic/whatever launcher, click install, and click play. So pray tell, which of these options is "knowing better" than gaming on Windows?
---
[Filtered on WoWhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/spells?filter=15;0;spell_arcane_blink) for all spells using that icon. Apparently you can search by the icon image to see all things using the same icon lol wow
---
With herb. Otherwise just do ZF.
---
ZF is 45g per hour, averaged over many runs. DME with herb is 60-80 with herb + satyrs
---
ok
---
I'm a lvl 60 retribution paladin who is looking to get more into raiding. 
---
I know that people are really only looking for holy and was considering respeccing.
---
 I have only like 5 pieces of offset armor and was wondering how I can build a very simple set to start healing dungeons. Just buy them from the AH? Any specific and cheap pieces?
---
Have you thought about asking the three players involved what their feelings are also?  It's entirely possible the Shadow Priest might surprise you can tell you to give it one of the healers - you never know.  As someone who was a Priest in Vanilla I would just say that it feels better if you are at least kept informed of the decision so even if you don't ask them ahead of time I would at a minimum let each of them know who the next one is going to proactively.
---
When doing that you could even just set a priority for each one so they know the order going forward is Holy Priest 1, Shadow Priest, Holy Priest 2 (for example).
---
&gt; No, the reset part sets the sequence back to Frost Nova when it's off CD without Blink having been used.
---
I understand what castsequence and reset do. I thought it would proceed even on a failed cast but that appears not to be the case.
---
&gt; You can't /cast /cast two spells that trigger the GCD with a single macro. The script will end with either recasting the first spell or printing an error message if that spell has a cooldown.
---
Nonsense. It'll trigger the first and print an error for the second if the first is available, and print an error for the first and trigger the second if not (or print another error if that one's on cooldown too).
---
So some trinkets have a cast time and some don't?  Is there any way to know besides looking it up?
---
Remember in Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3, where your trinkets took up room in your inventory?
---
mother of GOD that UI
---
Post more of your UI, I love watching peoples brains explode over it.
---
Priest can just manaburn, no? I will watch Video tomorrow. Thanks for the guide :)
---
at least the 2h fury warrior didn't take it from you because 'it's got as much dps as my 2h'...
---
Hes outside the inn, by the mail box, You have to be level 35+
---
Just keep questing, you'll have more than enough gold by the time you're 43/44.
---
Depends where you level.  
---
Stormwind is easiest, because of abundance of quest and all their locations are linked together.  
---
Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood, Hillsbrad, Arati - you should be at Reverted around this point.
---
Misinterpretation of how the stats are applied, trying to do some sort of atypical build, shits and giggles?
---
People are always going to be at odds with theorycrafting. I can't even convince my rogues to use more than a 1cp SnD half the time and then they come to me all confused why their uptime is 32% and their damage is trash, because apparently that 600 eviscerate hit is too important. Just do you, crush them in numbers, and laugh as they scratch their head but refuse to listen to reason.
---
In Vanilla I'd practically off-tank as a Rogue by just stunlocking enemies for 30 seconds straight. I'd look them in the back of the head and say "shhhhhh, no fight, you sleep now, you sleep forever".
---
His character was one of the best in the movie though lmao
---
Looks like Pharah with a mad sun reflection.
---
31/5/15 is an okay tanking build while keeping your Arms talents. You end up okay in PVP/DPS and okay in tanking.
---

There's what I have now at level 57. Switching from this loses so many good things... 50% crit on regrowth. Or swiftmend or +10% better healing or nature's swiftness or 15% better rejuv...
---
Dude I dont know how many different people and how many downvotes you need to get before understanding what is a super obvious and clear concept.
---
Shareholders apply pressure to increase profits, game designers are now influenced by this pressure to make decisions they otherwise might not and develop mechanics that might increase profits at the expense of a quality experience for players.
---
How can you not grasp this? Do you think the 50+ people that have commented here disagreeing with you are all wrong? Take a second and think about this man.
---
Yes we look amazing and we have shadowmeld!
---
this post? this ui? this situation? all trash. he’s a gnome you dork.
---
Boondock Saints reference ? Take my upvote kind sir
---
He seems like the perfect guy the corpse camp and completely piss off.
---
I usually just put /target jed in a macro an spam it for a while. Same with other mobs I want to find.
---
And Charge/Intercept
---
No, but I've read about a few of them, and seen quite a few movies. The Friday the 13th ones are pretty good, as is Predator.
---
Disagree 100%, it depends on current composition and how healing is handled.
---
I just buy roasted quail from innkeepers.
---
Strat UD is a LOS nightmare.  Mages who CS are amazing in that dungeon.
---
Depends how comfortable your healers are, if the healing in your raids is a bit rough and you get to the end of fights with people on their last gasp then the extra healing would be a big boost. If your healers are fine then making one of them even more fine won't bring a huge benefit to the raid, whereas adding a bit more DPS would get the bosses down a little bit quicker, which smooths things out a bit. In a 40-man that means a lot less than it would in a 10-man, though, and the benefit is likely to be minimal compared to a boost to a smaller healing team IF that boost is going to keep people alive where they would otherwise die.
---
Big upgrade to healing team who needs it &gt; smaller upgrade to dps &gt; upgrade to healing team who doesn't need it

I was just transported back to my childhood

See that's the thing. My max game play time at any given time is 2-3 hours. Exept the rare occasion wife and kid are gone for the day.  I'm not like alot of the guys on here who will willingly ignore there child for wow lol. 
---
 So say even on the 1.5 hour clear. When I log in I'm sure there is guilds out there who can keep the time down. But as most thing I imagine if raid time was at 6 it doesn't start untill 6:30 or even 7
---
obvious troll
---
No one is getting any punishment for kicking someone from a party or raid.
---
Eh kind of ruined it for me, his scenes were so cheesy.
---
To be fair I think because of the cult following I take this movie too serious and judge it harshly because I expected it to be a dark thriller/action movie but turned out to be almost a comedy
---
Why don’t you just ask someone on your server who is level 60 or on your server Discord?
---
ahhh, alright.  Was wondering if there was something like that.
---
Because twinking a 60 is hard unless you're in the absolute best raiding guilds. Twinking a level 19 is decidedly easier for even the most casual players.
---
the ui works for me sorry it isn't simple enough for you. also, exploiting is exploiting. lil muted mage will get a ban for this. :P so take ur white night bullshit elsewhere kids.
---
Is ritual of doom not in classic?
---
I don't believe you. 
---
That many runs would see you swimming in a couple thousand gold almost from shared coin drops alone. The odds of seeing those items only once over so many runs is less than winning the jackpot.
---
Dragon Kill Points.  Basically currency you accumulate for being present for boss kills.  Gear is then auctioned for DKP.  Some guilds also reward DKP for things like donating flasks/pots/elixers to the guild bank as well.
---
Hunters just fall off instantly once everyone gets even MC weapons because of the lack of weapon scaling on aimed shot and multi shot.  Being ranged simply isn't enough to offset the raw damage increase from weapon scaling on their abilities.  While they do outperform melee on Shazzrah in most cases, because they deal half the damage of rogues and warriors on every other fight (including Geddon since you can down him before nova), hunter damage is pretty abysmal compared to other classes, which is why the top guilds only bring 2 for trueshot + tranq.
---
there are haste enchants
---
Don't worry, Cruel barb is technically better than that leg in gnomer anyways. I never had a barb drop on my rogue and had a friendly smith make me Jade Serpentblades instead to bridge the gap until SM. Might have to provide your own pattern as it is a world drop. The SM and RFD swords have held me over since then, and Thrash Blade is just around the corner.
---
Didn't they try that for Survival hunters one expansion?
---
I outdamage all the pure MM or MM/BM hunters in my guild. 31 Surv / 19MM.
---
It is a circle icon made out of squares so...
---
Go to Azshara.
---
You have an AH mount now ...
---
No worries, I know tank paladins are bad and most likely will stay that way. All I'm saying is that I genuinely felt bad for the tank paladin raid leader. It struck a nerve because I was that guy 15 years ago.
---
Great at notging mediocre at everything? Sounds like your pally is just fine
---
my first ony raid: "guys can whoever turn the soundboard off its kind of a lot"
---
raid: "lol welcome to DBM"
---
"feral tanks are useless" "Disagree, they're better because warrior players are jackasses" cue fragile warriors. 
---
Saying one tank is useless *automatically* brings warriors into the discussion since there's only two tank classes on horde.
---
Lowkey roast
---
Did you spec to get NS at 60 or did you play with EM from 40 to 59?
---
Because it’s really nice to be able to hop on and PvP with a character that’s fully BIS and always will be fully BIS. It’s a way to escape the gear treadmill and it allows you to set up your character exactly the way you like without having to raid for BIS.
---
Yes ur right. It’s just my banking auction alt. Crafting was an afterthought.  I would probably do hunter next time
---
How is the game unplayable? Please explain your logic. You sound like an entitled manchild crying about the game not catering to you
---
They are not smarter than the 1 head ogres. But they came to the conclusion that 2 heads is better than 1, so they believe to be smarter than the others. It's explained in one of the books. I believe it's 'Rise of the Horde'
---
Ok. But what about the food stuff?
---
This, exactly this. That was the exact reason why I didn't try WoW classic before. I regret it to this day, still enjoying it now though :D
---
maybe, if it wasn't for the fact that he has to blink under it. and it says invalid target when they come out. i mean cheating is cheating.
---
Well shit. That sucks. Oh well. Just gotta keep grinding I guess.
---
Iv not even watched this video, but coming from runescape this was a very common tactic. Manipulating people into thinking certain items are get rich quick but they’re actually your items you’ve been buying for a while and then sell off to someone trying to make money. Odds are they do if they’re one of the first ones to jump in on it so more and more people do it until no one wants to buy and some people lose money by being the last ones to buy them
---
He said he's already on Skeram.
---
atleast 3,000g on the low end for that many runs. You're correct, pity pity qq
---
You actually get yelled at by people if you keep pvping hard after you hit rank 14.  The whole system is based off how others are doing, so you essentially take the slot of someone trying to rank up still.
---
you forget mc fights are 2-3 mins long. I am a top 7 dps in most fights, and top 3 on rag. Currently spriest are better than a lot because the fights are fast and bursty. In BWL we should drop a bit but MC we can keep up with big damage.
---
Guildie gave it to me. I'm guild alch and he only wanted 130 2 wks ago. I offered to buy it half off (guild price) and he said just give me 30. Then in trade I tried to buy it for 50, 20 more than he asked. He was so happy that I was willing to help him by offering more then what he asked that he just gave it to me free. Idk. If I personally ever knew the power of the recipe I woulda told him to keep it and sell it for mount money, I mightve had I not been alch. At the time I was just trying to collect all the recipes tho and stumbled into a happy printing press.

Carrion bird deals 7% less damage than an owl.
---
A Carrion bird has 5% more armor than owl.
---
I’ll take the damage tyvm
---
You're better than I. I want to solo farm instance
---
Once you have some gear you can heal as 30/0/21, but until you have at least some pre bis items you can’t REALLY heal a 5 man without either drinking after every single pull or having to REALLY try. You just aren’t mana efficient enough
---
That's not even close to enough at 60. Maybe while lvling.
---
Like I said, I only have this single run screencapped and therefore cannot provide evidence that my memory of this week's speedrun logs is correct, even though I am certain that it is.  In addition, attempting to use "10k raid logs" worth of data to support your claim that "top guilds" have hunters at the top of charts is completely disingenuous.  The majority of logs do not matter if your claim is regarding top logs because the majority of logs are from low performing guilds who likely do not have the gear from which rogue and warrior scaling stems.  Yes, hunters and mages have the highest performance when everyone has bad gear, but that bit of information is irrelevant in a discussion about the practices of top guilds.  
---
Even without the logs up to provide evidence in the current moment, how can you honestly believe that hunters, with no weapon scaling on aimed shot and multi shot and with HALF of the boosts gained from tribute + ony buffs + flasks can out damage rogues and warriors when all parties have their bis weapons?  
---
What are you willing to wager on hunters not being at the top of the meters for the top 3 speedruns once WCL comes back up?
---
Yes, and they also increase the speed at which casters can wand down enemies.
---
OR... you could do it how i do it and not kill any of the mobs..
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptAtUzNlp-8
---
this is the only reason i can think of either. it's so bad players can dominate and feel good despite having little to no skill
---
I need to get me one of these "mains" everyone is talking about.

[This place was Armageddon](https://youtu.be/yz2QPabGc3Q?t=145)
---
&gt; You can't /cast /cast **two spells** that trigger the GCD with a single macro.
---
&gt; Nonsense. [...] I have such a macro for my mana gems, to use the best one I currently have available.
---
Those aren't spells. Those are items. I stumbled upon this problem when I tried to double-/cast Blood Fury and Blade Flurry with a macro.
---
Agreed. The flying made it horrible but it was really flying + cross realm grouping that killed it for me. A decent fight almost never happened. If the sides were evenly matched there was so much lag it was impossible to tell what was happening. But most of the time it was either a swarm of Ally or Horde and if you were lucky you'd be on a shard where you outnumbered the enemy faction.
---
it's ok kiddo, puberty is just a phase. Hang in there.
---
Just saying... rogue has sprint at lvl 10, which is fantastic to have on a crafting alt
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
They wiped in phase 1. You don't need more thank 1 tank for phase 1.
---
Onyxia resets every 5 days, and there's a weekly reset Tuesday nights.
---
Good call! We searched up how to do that when one group went back and forth to Darkshore.
---
ExtendedCharacterStats is an addon that will show that, hit chance, individual magic school damage bonuses, etc.
---
you just want to dominate people who have no chance of fighting back...
---
I'm not trying to be offensive in any way, but do gay men attend a bachelor party together? I've never actually thought about this before. If you're a woman then it's another story, you get a different party lol
---
You don't even need to kill any dogs..
---
&gt;Quite a ... to say no mystery and no emotional danger to a company who literally killed half of their heroes in one go.
---
The snap? There was nothing groundbreaking about the snap, and then they Deus Ex Machina everyone back to life. There is literally no threat of danger, the heroes always win. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's certainly not risky or dramatic. It's like watching MacGyver, you know he's never going to die and he's always going to make it out of whatever silly trap he's in.
---
&gt;Those movies didnt start yesterday, they started with bunch of unknown or second tier , no star power actors, and reach this level by pure professional well deserved success.
---
You've got to be kidding? Ironman, the first one, had RDJ, Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Hulk, #2, starred Edward Norton and had Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and William Hurt. Ironman 2 had all the others and added Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Samuel L fucking Jackson. Thor, had Natalie fucking Portman and Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins.
---
Unknown??? Second tier??? Mate you have got to be joking. These people were all well established. You could argue RDJ had a bit of a comeback with the MCU, but the rest of these folks were already huge. 
---
Also, Birdman was fucking great.
---
A snack.
---
Pulses every 5 seconds.
---
I haven’t forgotten anything, I said exactly what the purpose of a shadow priest is. If you are top dps that says more about your other dps than it does you, unfortunately.
---
That's why you mind vision one of your allies that's closer to the enemy base, and just chain mind vision.
---
I farm rich thorium a lot
---
The worse people, are same faction mutts, while you are on top of the node handling 1 mob, they will mine it under you as if they didn’t notice you there at all.
---
I'll have to try it when I get back home then
---
As a warrior tank, I accepted long ago that Bear tanks are better than me at everything except mitigation. It's part of why I'm leveling a druid tank for my alt.
---
Quiver/ammo bags.
---
No they don’t work on throwing knives or wands (for anyone wondering)
---
I play herod and have not once seen any mafia. I've skinned at least 100 devilsaurs.
---
Juju power is also melee only. Most people dont know that.
---
fuck tbc
---
Deep BM is actually terrible for lvl 60 pvp and the answer is obvious: Pets don't scale with your stats.
---
Also BM spec pets can still be killed by most dps easily. On top of that you need los of your pet to cast intim/wrath. Cant use either while you are cc'd too.
---
Phenomenal leveling spec. Ass in pvp.
---
Damn, warriors can be scary.
---
Invisibility is different from stealth.
---
Wait that's part of dbm! I could of swore it was just a guldie playing that every time we do ony.
---
So you’ll eventually get your legs chopped off and burnt to a crisp. Probably never even smashed Padme a second time..smh...
---
I joke that, as arms, I will ALWAYS kill the warlock...and then ALWAYS die to same said warlock as their dots kill me while i walk away.

This....and I have seen it happen

No, blizzard, nostalrius, and the classic community made this possible. Chromie is just a dumb gnome they gave lines.

&lt;Exhausted&gt; US-Westfall
---
Exhausted is a new alliance guild on Westfall switching from the horde side due to population issues. We are looking for new members dedicated to the game. Currently re-rolling means re-leveling, but during the switch we would like to build a core that is ready to raid in 1-2 months minimum. Our current needs are social members, but also people who plan to strive for endgame content. Everyone is welcome to join, but at the same time we will be looking to build several raid ready rosters for split MC/Ony runs, as well as a community to push PvP rank in phase 2+. 
---
    Warriors: Need All
---
    Rouges: Need All
---
    Mages: Need All
---
    Priests: Need All
---
    Warlocks: Need All
---
    Druids: Need All
---
    Paladins: Need All
---
    Hunters: Need All
---
Exhausted is built on the hope of obtaining several core rosters to push each phase in classic WoW, and we need people who are willing to persist in that goal. We want like minded individuals who are willing to help others and be a part of a community.
---
These are the current raid times.
---
Sunday 8-11 pm server time
---
Monday 8-11 pm server time
---
[Raid times may change as the core group is built]

So in a pug I hesitate to do this.  If I see the tank is ignoring a caster, it's a no brainier.  Otherwise, I'm going by markings.
---
Try to build a set that is +spelldmg even if you have to compromise for mail and (rarely) leather. Currently I have +200 spellpower with my set and am at a point where i won't need that much mitigation as things just start melting.
---
I don’t know what you are talking about. I’m Fury War with only the Drakefire Amulet for Fire Resist. I’ve never needed a Fire Prot Pot. I’ve lived through all fights we’ve cleared.
---
Rag is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
---
Idk why you'd waste that much time killing those packs when you can kill him in under 4 minutes by just keeping the dogs kited on the ledge
---
Time to revive Mail From My Alt With Touching Story Made Up posting
---
Our guild is “pugging” MC with 1 other guild while the rest of our squad hits 60. Our guild is full of 30 somethings with a lot of them having kids so they are leveling pretty slow. 
---
So far it’s been pretty good. Still no rag down but we are clearing to him every time before we run out of time. Some loot drama but nothing major. Working on brokering a merger but that’s always scary. 
---
If you want to raid you are much better off joining a guild that is either already clearing or is about to be clearing on their own. A lot of guilds are pugging till they have the numbers. If you join a pugs discord and the raid leader is a prick, just leave before you zone in so you don’t get saved. There is a reason that leader can’t field a full guild run on his own. There will always be another pug. Pugging raids is a much bigger thing than it was in Vanilla.
---
A lot of our squad are in their mid to late 50s. So hopefully we won’t be pugging for much longer. 
---
Good luck my dude.
---
Brace yourself for the downvotes.
---
It’s way too early to release additional raids.
---
She made the turbo discombobulator tho
---
I know how you feel. I've been lucky with the classes at uni this semester, so I've had a lot of spare time to game. I can't begin to imagine how it'll be levelling your first character once phase 2 hits
---
If you put in five more syllables into the middle line for warlocks it could've been a haiku!
---
I leveled ret then switched to that same build around 55. It can be a bit tough to tank dungeons at first until you get crazy good gear. Holy shield would probably help. I had a few healers complain about how much damage I was taking...but my DPS was excellent.
---
Yum yum:D
---
90g epic mounts at rank 11. 
---
Never had more than 250g in vanilla.  Hit rank 11 and bought 2. (horse and cat), then grinded out cat rep.
---
(and before you say I could have farmed the money faster, I had a BF that was grinding to Grand Marshal and he basically required me to heal him to rank 14, so I was already pvping anyway)
---
Many people don’t which is why I am saying that, I been in 6 Rag PuGs and most of the people die from fire/poor positioning
---
So is Aspect of the Cheetah and 6% bonus from talents...except you’ll level to 35 faster than any class in the game..
---
No it's not, MC and Ony are being routinely pugged.
---
I saw a weird purple penis shape until now. Never really thought much about it as many icons are abstract
---
What bug?
---
Only your characters abilities/skills are effected by +elemental spell damage ( Hunter pet skills ARE NOT effected).
---
I keep looking at BWL and naxx gear imagining the golden god my warrior will become, I feel for you
---
dammit.  i wanted to join this damn raid (as alliance) since a guildie mentioned it, but I couldn't find anyone advertising in LFG chat since I was out in the world so just assumed he was mistaken.
---
I hope to join the next raid, preferably thunder bluff since i love that place
---
do you have a video of this? I'm not sure I entirely understand what you're describing
---
...so? They’ve been routinely pugged since there were enough people to run them, lol. It’s still too early
---
With fights that last 2 mins spriest will beat alot of people. Healers will be overhealing after 2 weeks why night up dps potential. If the spriest is a guild player and works for the common goal.
---
Number #3
---
IDK but i've been getting a lot of people that will ignore you over 1 joke, like right away.. (like making a joke about a dps warrior tanking instead of waiting for a tank after 20 minutes of looking) among other things
---
&gt; Hell a healer the other day was complimenting me on using Curse of Tongues on some casters to nerf their DPS and had never seen a warlock ever use it before, lol.
---
All we see is Rain of Fire and Hellfire and Life Tap so when a Warlock does something that reminds us they're not a Mage using fire spells it's pretty great.
---
Oof yeah BFA has been incredibly rough gold wise for me since I didnt abuse the mission tables
---
I totally understand it’s not for everyone, but for my crew, it was a blast! It was a throwback to a much simpler time when we all played WoW together. Now we hardly have time for WoW or video games in general, actually. It was so fun and chill to hang out and level up together in between the other activities and outings we had throughout the weekend. I’m happy Classic was released when it was so I could incorporate it into the party. :)
---
id still rather pvp on an undergeared 60 than a low level char who offers me no challenge because im one shotting ppl
---
Thanks dude. Hope it works out. Doing the live chat right now.
---
Listen to this guy. Because being 60 wont keep you safe from the incoming gankfest
---
I feel like with the recent release of Dire Maul, any PVE content that would come with phase 3 should stay away for now. I wouldn't mind having Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin released this month though.
---
Hmm, it's a close call... Get chopped and burnt, but still smash Natalie Portman or not
---
You can do demo sacrifice and deal shittons of damage in vanilla too, the TBC talents are not needed.
---
The only problem warlocks have in terms of dealing damage is the lack of threat reduction (especally as horde). Two massive shadowbolt crits in a row on threat sensitive fights (basically all of BWL) will wipe the fucking raid, but at least you are shitting on everyone in the DPS meter.
---
And if you put 1 shadow priest in the raid you can just stack warlocks just as people like to stack mages. 
---
Warlocks also have great sustainability (again, even better if you create groups like 4 warlocks + 1 shadowpriest) and they will self sustain very well, and deal shitton of damage.
---
I’ve been in a worse guild. They use loot council. Nice. Except not really. Guild leader has a list for officers who gets which weapons in a certain order. Kinda defeats loot council purpose. May as well use DKP except this way you make your guild feel like they have a fair chance if they need something but in reality you’ve made your own loyalty program. There was a 2 week trial period. Can’t get loot. Cool, no problem. 2 weeks of watching them give BiS weapons to other warriors who had 2-5 pieces prebis and some of them mostly in greens/defense gear. That’s fine. I’m still on trial. Then the 2 weeks were over, after killing rag the 2nd time I ask if I can be a raider and eligible for loot. I’m by far the best geared warrior on the team in full prebis I would like a shot at a weapon. “Check discord”. 10:50pm 5 minutes after asking there’s a post “new raider prerequisites” 4 weeks of raiding to be eligible for raider. They told me we will consider that I was there before the new rule and after 1 more week I’ll be raider. Ok fine. Go kill Ony and clear Mc next week. Ask GM if I can be raider. He kicks me from guild lmaoooo
---
Read what I just said. If a shadow priest is beating your mages, rogues, hunters, and warriors on a 2 minute fight, you are doing something wrong.
---
You could go with La Migra which is kinda the slang term for border patrol.
---
I used the SM quest axe instead.
---
Your shittiest Mage goes WC
---
Perhaps I'll understand better when I'm in a raid but I feel like everything I have chosen gives me the option to be either. Why does moonglow's 9% mana effeciency to healing and nature's grace proc outweigh 50% regrowth crit, swiftmend, 100% threat reduction on tranq, 15% rejuv effectiveness, 56% less chance to get interrupted while casting healing touch and regrowth and tranq and 20% less threat from healing.
---
Yeah the gap is who is paying more attention to their second monitor/phone lol
---
Delete all your bars and make weak auras for abilities that you use with cooldowns.
---
Swiftmend is a viable spec, and you can definitely go over 30 in resto if you really want. But you shouldn't go 0/0/51. Why? A lot of reasons:
---
* You don't need subtlety or improved tranq. You shouldn't be pulling aggro, even when going hard on raid heals. If you are, the tanks have messed up pretty badly.
---
* You don't need improved enrage
---
* Only 1 druid needs to take imp. reju/swiftmend, really. It doesn't stack across multiple resto druids, since only 1 can be active on the target, and usually there aren't *that* many people taking sustained damage that would benefit from multiple rejuvenation druids. Plenty of druids will spec into it regardless, and it's not a bad talent (esp. with swiftmend), but it isn't necessary by any stretch.
---
* You don't need Furor as a straight resto druid, it's wasted points
---
* Only 1 druid *needs* to take imp. MotW as well, since you can just organize with them for consumes.
---
So there's only a limited number of actually super beneficial talents in resto. In comparison, you've got HotW and MG/NS; both of which are much better at solo content than straight resto, and still hit most of the major talents. They're just generally more versatile while still allowing for "good-enough" heals which is really all you need on a healer. 
---
Better heals means fewer wipes, but if you aren't wiping in the first place, it doesn't do anything else. Healing is about exceeding the bar minimum threshold by a factor of safety and calling it a day.
---
p.s. I saw in your posted spec that you didn't take nature's swiftness... Take nature's swiftness
---
A band of brothers meme on this subreddit? a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Yes it's to buff shadow damage, but if you recruit an spriest, or in my case asked to switch for locks don't screw us over.
---
Honestly, don't even listen to anyone that says you have to respec into prot at 60. Unless you are raiding, doing dungeons is still a cake walk as arms. Just make sure your gear is good and you are good to go.   
---
Here is what I did:
---
Post level 54 I only ran BRD. This has so many BiS and other great items for you to grab. You can start farming for HoJ and Savage gladiator chain. As fulfulling the tank role you can reserve HoJ until you get it no problem. Other items you can get that are going to be great for you are Head and boots from Phalanx in the bar room. Then you can get neck, cape, and dreadforge retaliator if you run arms outside of instances. 
---
Just make sure you run a lot of dungeons, stay very well geared, and you can do ANY dungeon as arms with NO difficulty and get VERY quick dungeon groups. As someone that focuses mostly on wpvp but wants fast groups and quick gear, this way has worked for me greatly, and literally playing arms tank through post 60 dungeons is EASY if you keep grinding dungeons/buying BiS pieces like (Myrmidions signet) off the AH.   
---
Just stay geared and you're fine not respeccing if that's not what you want to do.

Some pretty good battles at the dark portal for the first couple days after launch. But ya.
---
I'd wish
---
Seal of righteousness.  I know it’s SoC for slower eels, but every SoR tick has a chance to proc chance on hit effects.
---
&gt; Half the raid is split on each side so you’d realistically get less threat than usual.
---
If you were doing that with a Prot Pally you would just make sure enough of one class is on one side. It buffs just one class, not the whole raid/group. 
---
&gt; The threat pallies gain through spamming kings requires a fuckton of bag space (two stacks pet minute)
---
Where are you getting 'two stacks per minute'? You would need a 0.6 GCD to be able to go through even just one stack per minute. You do know Symbol of Kings stacks to 100, right?
---
&gt; and doesn’t scale whatsoever while warriors scale exponentially and have multiple tools to ensure mobs stick to them.
---
Yes, it doesn't scale.. but it's providing so much threat right now that it doesn't matter until AQ or Naxx. A Warrior's highest threat-causing ability as far as I can research right now is Revenge, with a threat value of: 315 + threat from damage + 25 threat on stun proc. 
---
Which is a non-spammable ability. Here's their AoE threat generating abilities. If the values are off I'm happy to change them, but this is what I'm finding. 
---
Thunder Clap: 130 per mob hit + threat from damage
---
Battle Shout: 55 per player receiving buff
---
Demoralizing Shout: 43 per mob receiving debuff
---
Greater Blessing of Kings is 114 threat per player buffed. More than double Battle Shout. So even with just five of a class, that's providing 570 threat -per cast-, with no cooldown, and a very minor cost of 150 mana and 1.35s per reagent. 
---
That's just talking threat without considering threat from Mana Gain (Wisdom), Retribution Aura, or Sanctuary which all will be going on with auto attacks without interruption while spamming Kings. 
---
&gt; There’s also 0 need for aoe tanking since only 2-3 mobs should be alive at any given moment on each side, which makes the entire point of “aoe threat for Nef P1” completely moot.
---
Now that, I'm not arguing against. I wasn't arguing that they're suddenly necessary for those situations, but I think you're misunderstanding why the Kings spam has value. If your raid has even just 6 of a class which is very common when it comes to Rogues, Warriors, or Mages, you're generating genuinely, mathematically ridiculous amounts of threat on a very low cost. That's without considering the threat from quite literally anything else. It doesn't make having a prot Paladin necessary or some MASSIVE advantage that every raid will want one.. but it's an example of a situation where they can now let everyone burn those mobs with reckless abandon pretty quickly IF you have one. 
---
You don't -need- to sit there and hit kings every GCD. The value is in the fact that you can snap and build threat on demand. Your DPS do not need to give much, if any time before getting to go all out. 
---
As of right now, I personally feel the best value of Kings spam is on Onyxia. You have no problem holding her through Phase 1, and you can build snap threat as Phase 2 is ending so your DPS really don't even need to slow down -- and if something DOES go wrong and someone is say, feared into whelps, Kings raid-wide threat actually picks up all whelps and makes them waddle straight through the blender that is your DPS harmlessly while you do nothing but tank Ony.
---
You’re right. I also have pretty good tanking gear for my level so I think most people are pleased to see me join their group. I just like casually doing dungeons and I feel like people start expecting a lot when they’re paying for a tank.
---
I started playing Vanilla WoW about 6 months after release. Never had any problems leveling up 60's on PvP servers. Got a lvl 48 right now, can't wait for the fights. I have no idea why some folks are saying that  getting to 60 is now going to be some Hunger Games death match. Yeah you might get ganked some more. PvP servers gonna PvP. Just play the game and enjoy.
---
The raid isn't split, they stand in the same spot to group up all the skele's for their res to be aoe'd down.
---
The problem with your narrative is that I'm a healer and I quite like healing 2h Arms warriors, because anecdotally they have been some of my smoothest and fastest runs. If that's because a 2h weapon is what it takes to keep ahead on threat, that's fine, I'm not running out of mana if the enemies die fast because the DPS get to open up. I don't really feel like difficulty is being passed off to me.
---
The majority of other healers are all resto shaman solidifying their places with mass chain heals. They are all very close to each other on the meters, firmly taking 2nd to 5th spots or so. 
---
The only time I measure up is on certain fights where chain heal doesn’t work out and they have to resort to single target healing. 
---
But in any case healing throughput is not the problem that’s for certain.
---
Thanks so much. Fast offhand?  Dagger?
---
How did you see the mage when your UI takes up half your screen???
---
how else do you ruin low lvl bgs for everyone else?!
---
Again with the blocking out of names. Honestly, these are the people who need to have their names put out there. Why hide them?
---
Wow, that's quite insane if anyone managed to pull that off by actually banning RL even for 3h.
---
You're in the jungle, baby!
---
Okay, those are some pretty good arguments about the reality of things in casual guilds.  I have definitely been more toward the hardcore end in recent years.
---
I do find that knowing where you are going (in terms of skill or practice) are valuable to have even if you're not there yet.  For example, if you're surviving fights, understanding that you might be able to try adding more threat gear as a tank is very valuable.  You may misjudge and not know when that point is, but it's good to know you go there eventually.
---
Thanks for reading, I enjoy the discussion :)
---
Sadly I know da wae
---
Okay cool, I'll check this out.  Any recommendations on a pally build?  Should I just go full prot?  I'm looking up the drain tanking thing and found this guide that I'm going to read right now :
---

---
I'm assuming it's just gradually pull 1 after another while maintaining aggro and building up dots while we move, but I'll see what it says :)
---
I did this my very first drop
---
Is WorldDefense channel supposed to be global? It's currently identical to LocalDefense and only warns when something in the zone you're currently in is under attack. I know you get to talk there once you hit R11 but wasn't it supposed to also list attacked zones worldwide?
---
I had skinning / LW and dropped both. I am a miner now (2-3 man DM E jump runs = profit) and an enchanter for doing 3 man strat/scholo/DM runs to disenchant greens/blues that drop. Ill keep enchanting until i pick up engineering for phase 3.
---
You’re not getting screwed over, it’s putting the gear where it matters most and makes the most difference first. If you expected otherwise then your expectations are just off. 
---
Secondarily, most of the gear you want as a shadow priest is outside raid anyway.
---
&gt;  Stronghold Gauntlets 
---
Get Death Grips from UD Strathome
---
Well I've given you examples, and until you can give any counter to anything I've said, it's better than everything you've brought to the discussion.
---
Why do you care so much?  I wasn't even talking to you originally.
---
I fully endorse fucking with bots.  Good work.
---
Because you get Arcane Power...
---
Why?
---
Negative ghost rider, it's not Nef that's the problem :( There's a lot more before then and your distinct lack of gear or any real 'advancement' so to speak. You get kinda left in the dust and then pick back up again later but you never really 'recover'. you hit armor cap and.. then not much happens.
---
Skype for business, look it up. So basically millions of people use it every day. And no, not a fan of it either, but that's how it is.
---
This is why I love Horde on Blaumeux. The ratio (from that server post a month ago) had the server at a dead center 50/50 split, and it really feels that way too. If for whatever reason you're in a 40+ zone and " /1 " for help for Alliance picking on you, there's always someone willing to drop what they're doing to help out.
---
I thought it was some dude with his palm covering his jaw to his nose and giving us a shiny eye.
---
Used for what good cause?
---
What kind of statement is this? Lol
---
I respec weekly on my warrior. Arcanite transmutes on two characters is 65ish gold per week at minimum for doing nothing
---
Vanish when VW shield goes up if you can and reengage before they summon a second VW (if they do) or another pet.  Death coil is a 2 min cd so if they start with that you could be on to a winner.
---
Of course, you will probably die anyway.  Stun locking does work, to an extent, but if they are deep in aff you will end up covered in dots anyway.  Only ever interrupt shadow school casts.
---
can outrange mana burn with travel form
---
Nice save... 
---
Personally I would have admitted to a pro over taking 2 hours to do an escort quest.
---
There's a scepter you can get from Maraudon that allows you to port to the back of the dungeon. You can then quickly farm the last 2-3 bosses of Maraudon. They drop some good blue gear (notably a ring with 1% hit); can also be used to farm gold efficiently if you vendor the blues and have herbalism to pick the ghost mushrooms.
---
I work at a controller modding company, we're about to get busy as fuck.
---
You're welcome, and thank you, dps/tanks, for letting them wander a surprising amount of times, rather than breaking them until I give up and aoe.
---
It's easier to say, there is nothing you can do in animal forms
---
**Except.**
---
You can /use trinket
---
you can /use Weapon charges like MCP.
---
You can craft Bandages but can't use them in form.
---
You can gather herbs, and skin, can't mine.
---
There are like maybe 3 doors in the entire game you can use while in form the rest you can't.
---
There are like 5 quest objects you can use in the world you can interact with in animal form. (these are mostly attack animations. e.g. destroy the archive)
---
for things like potions you need a macro for each one + Form. The below macro cancels your auras (so you don't lose them) , then your form, then uses Major Heal potion, then puts you back into bear form with a single press.
---
    #showtooltip Major Healing Potion
---
    /cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
    /cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
    /cancelform
---
    /use Major Healing Potion
---
    /use Dire Bear Form
---
Dear god this has to be the worst UI I’ve ever seen, reminds me of Talladega nights with the Fig Newton ad on the windshield.
---
I've never ever thought of it that way, but it's hilariously fitting haha
---
If the loot priority wasn't discussed beforehand than yeah I agree kind of a dick move to bring someone who isn't aware that they aren't being considered for certain loot. 
---
I might be a bit biased because my guild has had several people have hissy fits and gquit when they find out we already have a SP for our main raid (co-founder of guild, no less) and that even he won't be getting the staff until the Holy priests have theirs.
---
There's nothing wrong with getting upset if loot rules that were set down aren't being followed.
---
To me dwarves are associated with hunting because they're quite often in a snowy areas (even before I played Wow), where they'd have to hunt for meat since there's not much vegetation
---
Completely agree.. raiding without ony buff feels underwhelming and boring now, as you can't compete for parses without it. The content is so goddamn easy without ony buff too, and there are like 6-12 times more people on each server than we had in classic 💁‍♂️
---
Its insane. We even have people advocating using an addon to make details not show your talent spec so you can lie to your raid guild about your spec. They're selfish and entitled, masquerading as being anti elitism /min max
---
You should already know growl to teach it, the pet won't really matter too much imo. Yeah Owl will hold some aoe threat better but if you are horde it's a lot of time to get at low level.
---
Just check your pet training you already have and teach it growl.
---
That's not every night? Must be fucking nice.
---
For sure, if one class is brain dead they all are
---
You do realize that there's an official Blizzard ran and moderated LookingForGroup channel, right? Like there's absolutely zero point to having a player run "LFG"?
---
20/31/0 is my paladin alt. I don't give 2 shits about divine favor, and holy shock is horrendous. Tank the 5 mans, heal the raid, you know what's good brother.
---
Some of this is attributed to how good the Cruel Barb is, and how at lower levels you level pretty quick and can easily go 10-15 levels without upgrading a gear slot. That compresses in the later levels. 
---
I don't mind the more sparse upgrades, they feel super good when you do finally get an upgrade because it isn't as marginal.
---
Ony isn't a DPS race. Phase 1 should just be white damage. Phase 2 is when you wanna go hard.
---
You can run BRD if you are in your mid 50s. Or DM east no problem. If you are in your late 50s I'm ready to take you to LBRS or DM North.
---
But if you want to go DM West, Strath or Scholo, you better be 60.
---
At least pummel makes sense
---
"Everyone has a plan till they're punched in the face"
---
Doesn’t matter what weapon it is so long as it has good dps and isn’t slow ( like anything 2.4 or slower )
---
What am I?
---
That’s true, was just an example
---
There is no Way to blacklist this, Since we’re not using their API😅
---
I def have nature's swiftness, not sure why it didn't copy over.
---
Thank you for the built out reply. 1st off, I'm not concerned about solo content. and you are correct about furor, never taken enrage. But if I'm the only resto druid imp motw is a must? Also see my reply elsewhere about the talents I lose just for moonglow and nature's grace. Is it that much better?
---
Please tell me she knows what a “twink” is IRL... It makes her costume rather perplexing.
---
Not there yet, but my plans are Lashers and Maraudon. Can still pull decent gold when combined with herb and it’s braindead stuff.
---
as opposed to frost bolt spam? lol
---
That sounds like a really interesting job. I open up, diagnose, solder, and fix electronics pretty regularly myself. Not because I have to, but I only do it once a week, so I enjoy it.
---
Me and my guild and everyone i ran it with never had any issues if we just waiting for them to pat away.
---
The guy asked for the fastest way, I told him. Why downvote someone for that haha.
---
One thing regarding these farmers is comical. Blizzard actually stepped up their game and now we see them actually farming again just like in real vanilla. So thats one thing from vanilla that came back. You can see them in multiple spots. Tyrs Hand, Maraudon, Winterspring Lake, and Dire Maul. The hunters are in Mara/DM. I'm even seeing some of the chinese farmer rogues wearing the old classic setup of Felhide Cap and Stormshroud Shoulders. It's nostalgic as hell!
---
I feel like the /target was still only what was in range of your actual player and not who you were mind visioning. That being said, if your team mate can target, you can select the target of target and mind vision that way. I definitely remember doing it that way as well.
---
Nobody cared about the tank before they died and took them for granted, but suddenly realize their importance when shit goes south.
---
I'm not sure when healing started counting for hks but it wasn't always that way.
---
He said he doesn't like purple mages(warlocks) and my rebuttal was one button rotations(frostbolt)
---
You could never swap trinks in combat
---
see i was asked to go spriest after working my ass off for holy prebis. I swap work my ass off for spriest prebis I also dump heavy damage on bosses. It was way more beneficial for me to have it then another priest since it would increase speed by a little bit. I also, heal outside of raid.
---
Decursive saves lives
---
it sure is, lots of butt hurt ppl on these replies too. guessing the alli comment more than horde :P
---
&gt; The unique aspects of every class is reflective of what an RPG should be    
---
Why does this not go without saying
---
Lest we forget
---
I get what you are saying but I don't think it was Blizz's intention to have 90% of Pallys in dresses healing when it came to raiding. It was a simpler time back then and the overall game design and itemization really messed a lot of classes up, not just Paladins. I don't think the devs accounted for min/maxers and theorycrafting when they were designing the classes and subsequently designing the raid encounters. When TBC and 41 pt talents launched it wasn't just a step in the right direction it was like a trebuchet launch in the right direction for some classes.
---
And BRS. BRS you can bring more, though technically that's because UBRS &amp; LBRS are a single instance.
---
Alch/herb is probably the most stable profession combo since people will always need consumables
---
Yeah, idk what the issue is if I don't want a run with pugs to be slower.
---
Get more priests and warriors, they'll learn what shield wall does. Eat through them till the boss dies kkthx.
---
I dont agree with the statement that no one likes boomies. Mages and locks love me.
---
Yeah tgis sub is....a but negative sometimes
---
There is a limited amount of PvE content available. If you move this up you move the rest of the timeline up in the process, while also drastically increasing the player power scale at a much faster rate. This has implications for PvE and PvP. 
---
Phase 1 also requires the biggest time investment for players in PvE because you have to level to 60, get some kind of dungeon gear, find a guild, and start clearing the raids to prep for future content. A significant portion of the playerbase is still in step 1 of that process. It’s possible to release content so fast it discourages people from playing the game. Obviously you can wait too long as well, so you have to have balance in your content schedule.
---
Should I continue?
---
Sounds legit. I was at least going to get a lock to 20 for this reason. I should get a better feel for them by then at least.
---
then fuck  phase 6 as well, kinda irrelevant to just consider 2 phases and ignore all the rest.
---
Also, Blessing of Light makes life so much easier for you. I would recommend using it on your tank. Will make you healing much more effective.
---
Yes it’s true and it can be argued that players are adult (or should have their playtime supervised by adult) and it’s not the game fault if some player becomes addicted but still: if I was a game dev and put in place a system like this, I would feel bad
---
Honestly love shatter spec DPS in classic assuming your group is set up to not have an actual tank. It's not exactly complicated but it feels so rewarding.
---
What server are you on? You should check your servers subreddit or discord to see if there's a guild that will be a good fit for you.
---
Hey what are your thoughts between 30/21/0 and 20/31/0? How important is holy shield? Can I tank end-game dungeons pretty well without it?
---
Yes most gear is outside of raid. If my guild asked me to switch then never gave me loot why would I raid with them? I can go anywhere and heal, multiple guilds have asked me to join, I passed because I like the people and trust i dont get screwed over. I worked my ass off for 2 prebis+ sets, farmed my eye, helped multiple others with their prebis, and get my necessary buffs to perform best that I can. I doubt ops guild has all dps doing this. Which is why i say currently reward the players putting in effort. Come bwl and beyond then go for gearing needs.  MC is a cake walk, by bwl if youre clearing mc every week everyone will have the loot ready to go.
---
I dare!
---
Man this subs quality is just crap.
---
Whoever thinks Paladin in Raid PvE is boring never played the class.
---
First of all its healing AND dispelling. Paladins can dispell anything except curses with the cheapest cast.
---
Divine Shield pulls - Pull a boss with his adds without the risk of having your tank one shotted by the group. 
---
Aura and buff management - depending on boss paladins want to change up buffs and auras, sometimes group composition need to change etc... 
---
Pre-Buffing tanks with LoH
---
Knowing which boss mechanics you can face tank/ignore with divine shield and which you cant. 
---
Learn which physical debuffs can be dispelled with BoP, when to use BoS and when not. 
---
Divine Intervention rotation to have a rezzer and start the repair-bill-mafia.
---
I consider Paladin fairly enjoyable in a raid environment.
---
Awesome! Hope everyone downvotes this and stops contributing so that you have to walk up and inspect players instead of asking for their gear score or raider io score, the way MMOs played before TBC.
---

---
But by this point a significant portion of the playerbase has already done what you consider phase 1.  There might be a few stragglers but at this point that's their own fault.
---
Yeah unfortunately without herbalism it’s not really worth it. I’m Tailoring/Herbalism on my Mage though so I like it
---
Dude, play a warrior at 60, you get messaged all the time if you'll come tank shit. It doesn't matter what spec you are.
---
200g max bro
---
I hope you let his GM know.  Some guilds are really weird about their 'no revolving door' policy.
---
Hell yeah, I’ll be leveling the alt in phase 2 so pvp will be meaty, also planning on getting this particular alt to 60, so there will also be a fair amount of pve played
---
Yes, and no. I mean it was 500+ people at once, in a very tiny area, but also it shouldn't have lagged as badly as it did.
---
When i charge a pack I open with thunderclap , demoshout go to def and sunder the first one. I never really have problems with the first target but the rest is a struggle with some groups. I do not want to blame mages etc and want to improve as a tank. 
---
Should I focus on stacking as many sunders on the rest of the pack to keep threath on me? This with shield bash should keep most aggro on me right? Also i spam revenge when it is up. 
---
The skull should melt pretty fast if I play correct so should I focus more on the rest of the pack ? I am using taunt way to much to keep it together.
---
Is the glitch the fact he can go under the building as a gnome? Because I can't understand the title of this post at all.
---
You do UBRS without a tank? Ok, lol
---
Or that Overpower is a literal sword.
---
prot/fury war - tanking dungeons and dpsing raids.
---
Gear Questions
---
- Does edgemasters (for a tauren) reduce the need for hit? Also, are they good for tanking dungeons? 
---
- Lionheart Helm. I know it's mainly a dps helm, but for tanking what's the piece that's equivalent to it (i think in dungeons it'd be fine, but when i eventually tank raids, what should i be looking out for?)
---
thanks.
---
increased mana pool isn't actually useful if you don't run out of mana.
---
Seems you've never been to Black Rock Mountain. I'm pretty sure the corpses spell out full sentences there
---
I do this all the time but i don’t think anyone has ever noticed :(
---
I sap rogues in the Silithus caves and mine the nodes in front of them. Then I kill them. I’m full pvp spec with the engineering stealth detection goggles.
---
I never said never give you gear, I said the shadow priest isn’t a top priority to gear up as it makes minimal impact compared to other classes.
---
The Horde don't need to talk to that guy for their Ony chain.
---
Indeed.
---
A lot of warlocks are learning that they should not be putting siphon life, CoA (if you arent on proper curse duty) and even avoiding using corr unless nightfall specced.  Too many other dots are far more important.
---
You bring 5-6 locks to a raid, thats all the debuf slots gone if they dont know what they are doing (which happens a lot, initally).
---
And thats not even considering all the other dots which should be there.
---
Herbalism is pretty crap imho.
---
It is much faster for me to configure my own groups. For one because a lot of people only search for groups. And secondary because I know a ton of tanks and they love me.
---
Great input, thank you.

about tree fiddy
---
At this point in the game, almost everyone will still be deep prot just because the DPS aren't geared enough to be threat-capping. Some of the server first people, that were clearing MC two months ago, might be getting there, but for most guilds that have only been doing MC for 2-4 weeks, their DPS aren't geared to the teeth yet, and therefore threat has not become an issue (or it shouldn't assuming you have a competent tank). Tanks can probably take some of the fury gear from dungeons if no one needs it (I've seen Eye of Rend won by greeds multiple times, and one time even Truestrike Shoulders), but for raid gear right now there's probably no guild that has ALL their melee DPS fully geared out yet, so it shouldn't be going to tanks. 
---
My old guild wanted me to go fury/prot as the third tank (I was hired to be OT, but got bumped to third because I was 59 for our first raid night, and somehow never recovered my spot) and roll against the DPS for gear. My question was, in what way does that help the guild? And they said it helps "gear the tanks faster", but the flip side is that it slows down gearing for the other 10-15 melee DPS. I'm new to WoW, but I've been playing MMO's for 8 years now and I've never played any MMO, of any kind, where tanks were given this weird preferential treatment, and it's a very weird mindset to me. I don't particularly care about the progress of one person, I care about the progress of the raid as a whole.
---
Well i am sorry to inform You that, a lot of players seems to love to contribute, we have around 38000 inspected players who love what we’re doing
---
You're gonna need blackened armor still and judging by your equips you're already 19
---
hope you got that sfk ring.....
---
Just change your dismount keybind
---
Got my Netherwind Crown in a pug that only wiped once before...something something luck.
---
People will dispute this but I recommend Anathema. It is one of the newer servers so a lot of the population is still leveling up. It isn't high pop but it is definitely healthy and I always see plenty of LFG activity. Balance is about 60 40 or 55 45 alliance to horde, so come help us fight back these pesky alli
---
A lot of this has already been said but to summarize:
---
Lava Burst - Only affects mana users (this includes enhancement shamans, ret paladins, and druids in caster form).  If your group has these, keep them separate from the rest of the melee group and tank group.  Ranged should be put in stacks of two... each stack should be spaced 18 yards apart so that no more than 2 are ever hit by this.  The mana using melee all have to stack together.  If feral druids are getting targeted, keep them out of the warriors and rogues alltogether.
---
Elemental Fire - are you rotating your melee in and out of range of ragnaros's  "wrath of ragnaros"?  If not, this could be the mysterious source of knockbacks and extra damage.  Melee need to disengage and move back, out of this ability's range.
---
Placement - see lava burst above
---
Knockbacks - the direction of the knockback can be unpredictable.  Walls can help.  Staying near to ragnaros can help.  I have never been knocked back into the outer lava ring if I was positioned on the inside of the ring closest to rag.  Those stationed far from rag need to be against a wall or know where they can quickly swim back up to safety should they be knocked into lava.
---
Also, after being knocked back, it is very important everyone return to their original spot ASAP and be aware of where they run to get there.  Mana users should not be running near the melee or tank groups.  If they get knocked near them, they need to gtfo asap and run back to their position.
---
Fire protection pots, healthstones and bandages will serve everyone in the raid well.  Everyone should prepot a fire pot and have another ready if their first one is consumed.  Everyone in the raid should also have a healthstone.  Everyone should have heavy runecloth bandages (only to be used once you have returned to your proper station.  Bandaging out of position will put yourself and others at greater risk).  There is no excuse for anyone to not have ALL of these items.
---
I was having this issue for like a month in my late 30's and early 40's. It was infuriating because I couldn't consistently replicate it. Sometimes my stealth bind would stealth me and then work fine to unstealth and then other times it wouldn't. Then I stopped noticing it in my 40's and just realized it hasn't happened to me in forever now. I hope they didn't re-break it.
---
I’ve played a mage for 12 years, and I didn’t think it was anything more than a purple blob!
---
Shadow priest dps will pretty much always be shit and they are there mainly for shadow weaving. might as well give to the healers.
---
Yeah, I'm a network engineer, "virtual machines and cloud" are not the reason why.
---
You can get great performance out of VMs and cloud, even moreso than physical because they can be configured dynamically to use more resources when available.
---
Then just 50% twink.
---
Whitemane gang
---
It's much different from 60 in that you don't have to poop-sock to get the BiS gear.
---
We have a difference of opinion. I feel at the current state reward those who put in the effort, since mc you can fart and kill all the bosses.
---
I mean, sort of? It's classic, we're taking shadow priests, ret pallies, boomkins, etc cause the content is braindead easy. You're going to do more dps than those three, and we're still taking them, so why wouldn't we take you?
---
Lmao ok.
---
Oh they stop attacking?! I did not know that...
---
I agree that 48 is too low for a random.
---
But BRD level range starts at 52.  No group I have seen would turn away a lvl 52 healer.  
---
At that point, it's a question of how low would most groups be able to go without issue.  A lvl 50 that is likely to hit 51 during the run anyway is pretty easy to accept in to a group and work around without significant impact.  The healer hangs back far enough that aggro ranges are an extremely rare issue.
---
The reason why there is discussion over this is because it's people communicating their reality and viewing the question from different stances.  One side is seeing little to no slow down in exchange for starting faster in most cases, the other is recalling some nightmare of a run from a lowbie that had no situational awareness so pulled everything, mismanaged resources because they were then on tilt so had to sit a lot, maybe had another problem member of the party so the lowbie had more issues than normal, etc.  The actual math and average case gameplay doesn't lend to avoiding slightly lower level healers.  But if you had bad experiences and want to avoid them, no issue with that.
---
0/31/20? Humanoid slaying, maybe some in parry, savage strikes, entrap/wing clip your preference, hp talent, deterrence, clever traps. Kind of preference really for a lot of the surv talents I believe. Just switched to this myself for raiding, DM:T runs, and to assist in world pvp.  Will switch to 5/31/15 (more pvp leaning) or 20/31/0 (more pve leaning) once I get more hit.

As a HotW/NS spec 46 druid that wants to both tank and heal dungeons, what is the best way to go about tanking a dungeon I don't remember from Vanilla? Healing is easy as I can just follow the group. Tanking however I'd like to lead the group and mark mobs. 
---
I have AtlasLoot with the Maps module, so I have all of the dungeon maps. However, some end game dungeons have multiple paths and bosses out of the way.
---
So, if I'm tanking a dungeon for the first time and have the map at least, how can I go about leading the group properly?
---
I know I can either 1. Watch a run of the dungeon, but I don't really want to do this 2. Ask someone else to lead/mark mobs and I'll just pull as we move along 3. Wing it following the map and tell the group to tell me if I take a wrong path/turn 4. Heal the dungeon first before I tank 
---
Which of these options would be best? Is there another option that would be better? Thanks!
---
I would always give it to a healer priest. Shadow priest damage is garbage. Their role is to give locks the debuff and if you don't take lots of locks its kind of moot anyways.
---
oh shit, forgot I was playing retail. Oh wait, I'm running SM in vanilla wow...I dont really think we need a perfect rotation.
---
A few is probably more like 30-50% of the playerbase.  
---
Just because you’ve completed it doesn’t mean you’re done. I’m sure the majority of your guild still needs a ton of their MC/Ony gear. And you’re getting more content in the form of world bosses as well in phase 2.
---
They don’t need to release a new raid yet.
---
Uhhhhhh no shit Sherlock.
---
What the fuck is this post lol. This sounds like a child explaining what they want for Christmas while stumbling over their words.
---
Deadmines dungeon in Westfall (there are quests related to it). Redridge Mountains are good for the level too
---
Leggings of the Fang are 5 Str 9 Agi 4 Stam, theyre not budget theyre better
---
Mage probably. I got mine to 60 and then haven’t really logged on since. Super boring to just spam frostbolts.
---
I always do this, if you don't undercut by enough to move the market I buy what looks like the first posted item.
---
Just read the talent dude or go look at any raid spec'd Mage. Doing 30% more damage is pretty good.
---
Serious jesus that is harsh on the eye holes
---
\#AllHuntersAreSobel
---
Benediction.   Most balanced pvp server.
---
My point is they are the best if gold is not a factor. If you have the gold and want the best item you can get for the slot, it is Stronghold Gauntlets. Anything less and you are going the "cheap" route and will have a lesser setup then someone else may have. You may opt for a weapon chain, or the Death Grips from Strat, but someone else may go for the BEST option and have just that much of an advantage on you.
---
Regardless of how much that advantage is, it is still an advantage.

blinking in RL works Also.

Step 1: Run

Step 2: Close Eyes and keep running

STep 3: open eyes

tadaaaaa: 10 meters blinked
---
Aheem, also gl nor hitting shit
---
Yeah she's a lvl 19 twink lmao
---
You're asking them to change the traditional release schedule in order to cater to pvp players that rolled on a pve server, at the expense of world pvp players that rolled on pvp servers.  World pvp is going to take a big hit once the BGs are released.  Changing that release schedule would be contrary to the spirit of what classic is trying to make happen.
---
You tell me one other change they've made that would be even close to the same scale as this one.  UI improvements?  Nerfing warlock infernals?  What?
---

Kinda hard to see the cloak - but with some benefit of the doubt, let's just call it Sentry Cloak
---
/console reloadui
---
In classic some classes have hard counters, in warlocks case, its the hard counter to almost everything.  There is nothing you can do against a decent warlock, best don't fuck with em and go stabby stabby something else.
---
*Feign Death*
---
Annnnnnnnnnnd now it’s your problem
---
If you aren't running out of mana then you could have played the fight more optimally.  In a theoretical perfect fight you should run oom with both your pot and rune on CD right as the boss dies.  Mana left in your pool after the end of a fight equates to wasted potential healing.
---
Warlocks are tons of fun but if you don't like dots and pets then you will probably not like playing one.
---
Thats great!
---
Also, Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
It’s a pain in the ass I got to the last part with the first 2 rows sorted out then one of my coworker messed it all up over the night
---
I'd rather have +1% crit , +1% parry, +12stam  and immune to disarm over the alternative of Death Grips that will be +22str and immune to disarm.
---
Lol y’all deserved to get wiped for being so bad.
---
ok u didnt come up with the shadowcraft thing that was discovered like a month ago
---
i like ur UI lmao
---
In some cases they may have their own group of friends they'd go off to party with individually.
---
It'd be odd if they did 2 parties with the same friends and then the second party you'd have friends being like hey we did this last weekend with your fiance!
---
I work in the mortgage area and boy this is the busiest it's ever been with the feds dropping the rates the industry is at a all time low.
---
Why don't you go take a shower.
---
I know! It was hilarious when I did my first Onyxia raid. I never played in vanila wow (joined in WOLTK) and I didn't know the story. I'm familiar with the "run away, little girl, run away" voice from DBM but having this through DBM is just so fun. 
---
I believe if you die, DBM will play the part where the guy yells "minus 50 DKP"
---
Good god.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they drop one of the BGs early like they did Dire Maul.
---
That UI makes me want to gouge my eyes out.
---
The whole time they were out of combat I was inwardly wishing they would bandage up for the love of baby jesus
---
A twink!
---
why you having a panic attack lmao? the fuck, hunter top the charts, it's a fact. everybody is saying it in this thread for a reason and the logs only substantiate it.
---
Yeah sure warrior dps will be higher in some raids, but it deosnt mean that it's the case in all 10k raidlogs. The top guilds always have one or more hunters in the top for a reason.
---
found the ***disciplined*** priest
---
Not really with Dire Maul out. There are plenty of pieces that are easy to obtain, especially as tanks don't need to compete with any other class
---
so there are two individual timers?
---
It was selling for 400-500g. Now it's dropped to 200-250g on my server.
---
I speak in the situation where we share friends. I'd rather hang out together than have friends choose favourites.
---
That PC is old as shit. I haven't used it for gaming in years, so it has old programs/task bar icons from bygone eras that I've never bothered cleaning up.
---
Things will also go faster if you alter your rotation according to the needs of a group like an actual good player idoes nstead of blindly following whatever guide you read on the internet
---
The ability to adapt is way more valuable.them your dps meter.  Amy money with a keyboard can rip a dps chart but battlefield awareness and the ability to adapt to changing situations is what actually makes you a good player.
---
Enhance can use two handed maces and axes. If you are leveling as enhance I'd actually highly suggest Taran Icebreaker. I did and it felt a ton better just searching for more WF's. Brain Hacker is used end game for the same reason.
---
I love me in raids, as the spriest.  And really, that's what I care about most.
---
Raid geared Spriest to pvp with is the dream.
---
Also you get to be smug when beating the other casters.
---
Not on emp runs. You cant make it through the Atrium thingy if you have people below level 55. This is because you will aggro all the packs around you as well resulting in a constant slaughterfest until you die.
---
Make a macro for every single trinket? Doesn't seem very practical.
---
Unfortunately we become a one button rotation in TBC to be top DPS.
---
I always thought it was fingers holding a sparkling diamond. wow. my mind is blown after 15 years lol!
---
Yes, MC is 7 days and ony is 5
---
Great maybe, in some specific scenarios it is decently useful. But do you really need to tell me you kicked mana-burn on our warrior tank in SM?
---
Heal the dungeon first and learn that way. You still get to play while doing that and can learn easier. Dont wing it since some of the dungeons dont have direct paths like DM.
---
Rainbow warrior?
---
There is no "hurting the economy" in this game. Any "value" an item has is purely because that is what the market will pay. That Mighty Spoon of Mystery that you are selling really isn't "worth" 100g if you can easily sell it for 80g. As there is no cost of production for any item besides time (which has extremely relative value determined by the individual player), there is no "base cost" to judge and create profit margins for. 
---
And actually, if I sell an item for 20g less than the next and sell it immediately because of this as oppose to waiting for a day or two and having to perhaps re auction, then the "value"  am getting is time. I get my money sooner which might be more worth it to me than that 20g tomorrow or the next day.
---
This UI configeration is so confusing
---
What?  
---
The lock just has to Life Drain?
---
Dont use the blizzard client... Use the shortcut (wow.exe) in your classic folder.
---
Way better
---
Just like the guy lashing out, you don't understand that such a message communicates weakness. And I would never cooperate with someone like that, because I know that I don't need to. They can't handle the work of competing, so eventually they'll quit and I'll have less competition. And that *is* thinking of profit.
---
why?
---
Hard no. Catering to the demands of the loud minority, you in this case, is what made retail terrible
---
Space cannons
---
What kills me is when 60 warlocks haven't learned all their curses.
---
dang it, maybe next time
---
I can confirm this works, but I can't get the macros to work as well as in the video. I was practicing for about an hour last night on raptors in STV. 
---
So far the most effective method for me was have a swing timer, right click enemy to start my swing timer, and about halfway through their swing timer, sit (with x button). Then, try to hit S (or some other movement key) at the EXACT moment their swing timer hits the end, while spamming right click. I would get critted like 90% of the time with this strategy, and cause a reckoning proc about 80% of the time. 
---
I also tried putting a /sit macro on 3, /attack on 4, and spamming those. Not very effective. Also, on single tarket, doing the /sit, /startattack, /stopattack, /sit macro spam was not very effective but was kind of effective. I'm going to experiment with removing the final /sit from that macro later, or even the /stopattack. 
---
Long story short though, you can absolutely, 100% force crits and reckoning procs, and I fuckin **deleted** raptors last night doing it. For some reason this makes people very, very angry as evidenced by the pissed off people in /world insisting it was impossible, and the downvotes here. It's possible, for some reason not many people are doing it but it's possible, and you should be aware of it and how it works because you will get nuked in PVP from it if you don't start strategizing around it (i.e. be ready to hit a pally doing /sit spam with a stun because if they're sitting stunned they can't bubble).
---
If explaining everything in detail constitutes a panic attack for you rather than an exasperated attempt to convince someone who disregards logic and information, then sure, call it a panic attack.  We can simply wait on the site to come back up while you continue to spread misinformation.
---
Nobody said that, Its a discussion about gear, if youre too young to have a simple discussion about gearing please leave.
---
Those are PVP players you're grouping with.
---
So much this. It's easier to lash out and make it someone else's fault that accept that you made a bad flip and might not make a profit or actually lose. 
---
It's always the same options: A) Buy them out if they are so "Stupid" and undercutting by too much, or B) undercut them because you can't stomach buying for their price and therefore shouldn't have expected anyone else to buy yours for higher than that.
---
I used to play like that until I started playing lock. Nothing is more fun than juggling fear with that curse that turns off fear ( I forget the name) and just dotting the hell out of a mob of player.
---
&gt; For me it was camping the Felwood FP. As soon as I dropped I was dead lol. Jumped on the alt, ruined any fun these guys could have by camping me.
---
I think that's exactly what they'd rather you do, Not be on the character they know you as, and not progressing.
---
He was just being a salty bitch. Extremely valuable recipes are generally just freeroll from my experience. If you were 288/300 alchemy you have a legitimate  claim to roll need on it.
---
One of the questing addons (questie, or classic codex) automatically turns in and accepts quests, which is annoying for group escort quests.
---
200-250
---
Thats the thing, its useful in some specific scenarios. I don't really think it needs to be on 24/7. And it seems like every time I see it, I think to my self "Holy shit, is this really the first time you've kicked something in this dungeon? We've been here for half an hour"
---
Yeah. Those are just bad warlocks. The very least they can do is level first aid and bandage themselves back up to 60-70% before the pull.
---
It's also pretty easy to not get ganked frequently on a PvP server, just don't quest in the most popular areas.
---
The amount of people who complain about getting ganked on a PvP server and yet also insist on questing in STV....
---
You do realize a BM hunter puts 20pts into the Marksman tree only sacrificing 5% increased over all damage to ranged, 5% increased damage to Multi-Shot and 50 attack power.  For that you get an increase in pet damage and a much tougher pet that doesn't die instantly.  BM spec'd hunters do very close to the same damage as MM spec'd hunters.  In fact, in my raids with my guild I have done MC four times, twice as BM and twice as MM.  In all four instances, I am the #2 hunter and about #7-#10 in dps consistently in both specs.
---
Seriously, wtf is the point of flying?
---
Convenience, that's it. The whole point of Classic is that it isn't convenient. 
---
\#NoFlying
---
I loved when they released 2H axe but this time I hope they do it right and add 3H axe. Maybe give people a cannon or a ladder to be 3rd arm to crit noobs on zip lines between floaty islands
---
I can confirm the sit spamming works. Not as well as on private servers but it works. I was doing it last night.
---
You won't regret warlock at 60 when you visit Ratchet for a hassle-free no-gold-to-pay mount.
---
Warriors can help in the rare circumstance an archer mob is stubbornly standing and shooting away from the pulled pack you can intercept and disarm them.
---
It stacks to 4.
---
You do realize that he id a rogue?
---
Any plans on letting people make their characters private? I really don't like armory and raider.io idea.
---
Been selling em for 300ish lately. Farmed 34 of em solo with a few more in a group
---
what are good ways to get obtain gold at lvl 60?
---
Nope. But I'm sure lots of hunters on different servers have learned the tricks by now.
---
I had to do that today... We had an unspoken agreement until I shielded up and started casting, then they hit my mob... No pal. That's what we are not going to do!!
---
You can do this without resetting your swing timer by spamming a macro that looks like /startattack /stopattack.
---
I have 2 PCs, one that's for gaming, and one that got retired years ago. The old one is just a disaster in general.
---
OK boomer
---
Rank 1 SW:P has a longer range, is instant, and costs 25 mana.

How bad idea is it to have both herb and mining? Since you can only track one at a time

Coming soon "Dorf Gets Offended"
---
Use classicwow.live - it’s an amazing leveling guide.
---
Will tell you when and where to go to zones, what items to pick up prior. What xp to grind to before you move on etc.
---
Really makes things smooth if you’re looking for that.
---
&gt; If there isn’t much killing going on world pvp wise would that mean it would be easier to het higher ranks and rank points as a result?
---
Yes you can, you can play horde on a pvp server not named heartseeker or some scattering of small balanced pvp servers.
---
&gt;I'm on a pvp server and so far I had 0 issue with gankers.
---
Yes, I am also horde on a pvp server and alliances are so traumatized that they also all try to leave my sight as soon as possible.
---
What spec are you?
---
I've leveled both but I've stuck to my mage as my alt.
---
This is all warlocks do.
---
Dot dot wand. That's your entire rotation leveling. 
---
Mage, frostbolt,frost nova,blizzard ,blink cone of cold poly.
---
Your choice. I just moved to mage because warlocks are just dot and run
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
What is wrong with that? He gets his money more quickly. 
---
There is no way to "ruin the economy". The value of items is driven purely by what the player will pay. Many items are overpriced. And if you really are "playing" the AH, you would simply buy the cheaper item and relist, instead of getting annoyed you would see it as an opportunity. 
---
I go to the market to sell oranges from my trees at home. It took me very little effort to get those oranges, only time. No production costs. I see someone else selling oranges for cheaper than what I know the public will pay for them. Do I berate the other seller? No, I go buy up his stock, he goes home, and I sell the oranges at a higher markup. 
---
Just a free-ish market at work.
---
I’m not asking them anything - as I said I wish it would have been released with a BG rather than just world PvP. Sorry if that offends you so much? 
---
How about removing the 10 man xp grind from dungeons? That was never removed and was a part of the game. It’s not that I used that method to level but if you seriously sit there on the no changes bandwagon when there have been multiple changes from the original state then you’re either blind or dumb.
---
One more slice'n'dice and wipe or...not wipe and stun the caster. hmmmmmmmmm
---
In addition to other info, when fighting casters:
---
Use a 1Hander + spellstone.   Spellstone removes all magic effects on you.  This includes, sheeps, roots, dots etc (and all your own buffs, minus a soul stone).   It also gives you a shield in addition to a vw sacrifice shield.  With death coil and a healthstone on top, someone will need to do a serious amount of damage to you to even touch your health pool, never mind kill you.
---
Yeah wtf i saw a trail going into the mountains and tried to follow it but couldn't--it just dead ended into a steep mountain.  Are there more than one and I took the wrong one?
---
There’s two types of people here, ones that want to play classic forever, and those that want to play classic now and continue to new content later
---
Looks like the mage glitched under the building and isn't attackable
---
I've farmed 4 of them and my experience selling them has been:
---
First two sold for 450g  
---
Third one sold for 320g  
---
Last one sold for 250g
---
That depends on their effective stealth level vs your stealth detection level as well as their location to you (i.e in front or behind)
---
pretend to be a tank, join a spellcleave group, blame the mages then you cant hold aggro, and get free xp
---
Okay after reading through this thread, I conclude that you're blaming current lfg channels because you're toxic and blame other players for not wanting to carry you through content.
---
Negative is an understatement. Honestly this community is cancer for the most part id say 90% of people on here are toxic towards anyone who doesn't post the same 10 things that gets stupid amount of upvotes IE ( Chromie dinging 60 / Random imgur posts of someone raging in whispers.) Honestly just gonna unfollow this sub as most of the time its just the same 5 - 10 topics getting recycled week to week with the odd retail bash thrown in now and again.
---
As a resto shaman. I can raid, do dungeons, fish and maybe gather some herbs. 
---
I cant kill monsters. I currently level a mage to be able to farm.
---
Nah I like WPvP and this will be the patch that makes it explode until BG's come out.
---
Hell as a rogue I will run up and kick a motherfucker then bring him to the tank.
---
They go for 350g on my server.  In some ways it kinda sucks not having 1000 chinamen farming every valuable spot 24/7 like on pservers.  Supply for these types of things is much lower as a result.  I never paid more than 80g for one on a pserver.
---
I would just consecrate a whole bunch. Even if it's rank1
---
&gt; Come to Skeram to see if its PVE. You will Cry.
---
He said "horde PvE server"
---
aka, if they roll horde, it will be a PvE server. and he will not cry. Unless you two have alt-accounts now, and are also leveling up two gnome rogues to hit all the sides? If not, Have fun on your pve server with the occasional rare spawn alliance fam.
---
Only thing that comes to mind was a dude ninjaing a chest in a dungeon, laughing it off saying he is not a ninja and he was just in auto mode and made a mistake, another guy asks if we can roll on the enchant he looted from the chest, ninja says sorry i already used that.
---
Do you get less rep for these quests since you still get EXP before 60 ? I plan on turning in cloth for rep anyway to get other racial mounts, knocking out 2 birds with one stone would certainly be nice
---
&gt; There might be a few stragglers but at this point that's their own fault.
---
Yeah, fuck everyone with a job, a family, and a life outside leveling their WoW character. 🙄
---
It's been out 10 weeks. It takes 7–10 days /played for most people to get to 60, and the ones not there yet are likely on the higher end of that. You think Blizzard should just leave in the dust everyone who doesn't put in 3+ hours a day? Learn some patience or GTFO.
---
And even those of us who have been 60 for a few weeks now don't necessarily have any or many epics, since there's a limited number that drop every week.
---
I'm level 36 and I put 1 point into survival. I have been wanting to do a full survival / melee hunter tho. And I might.
---
Yeah. I got a solid 40-50% of a level from hinterlands quests. I made sure I grabbed the hinterlands quests from feralas and tanaris as well.
---
The AoE people give us Mages a bad rep, but it makes it really easy to look good, just cast Polymorph.
---
Sheeping something, anything, will make you a rock star. Who cares if it has DoTs or is the main target? You used a button that wasn't Blizzard, and that places you in the top 1% of Mages.
---
World PvP is world PvP, if you like it, you like it. My point is that the world PvP objectives did nothing to encourage world PvP, because the objectives were very cumbersome and rewarded almost nothing.
---
The main draw of BGs is fast respawns and fast action. EPL and Silithus were very slow respawn and very far apart objectives.
---
It's a pair of blue hands holding a glowing gem.
---
There is no economy to "ruin" since nothing in game has actual production costs outside of time, and the value of that for players is completely subjective. 
---
Honestly this is just basic free market stuff.
---
Probably in that 25-50% better range depending on class
---
Realizing that the Azerothians intended to slay the Guardian, Gul'dan hastily ransacked Medivh's mind for the Tomb's location. He was still deep within the Guardian's thoughts when Lothar and Khadgar killed him, ending Medivh's treachery and forcing Gul'dan into a coma.
---
Just saying that EShaman has tools to counter the SP. They aren't an easy fight at the high levels, period. Sure you can win, but they can win too.
---
It ain't SP vs warrior, completely 1 sided.
---
this UI is just fine on my 32in screen. i would understand for the ppl playing on actual monitors. but again. no one seems to notice it saying invalid target and the fact he can't run under there, they have to blink.
---
hate to be a pedant but that’s not classic
---
speaking of flying i was about to hearthstone to Goldshire standing in front of the entrence to Stormwind saw a player on a griffin like right blow at the entrence and i was like  lol wut? and they were like i have no idea i just happend to appear here 
---
and i thought for a moment they added flying in classic ;-)
---
Did not really want to link somebody else video on this users post.  Look for "How to Solo the 1st Boss in DM North as any Ranged Class" to see what I mean by  agroing the dogs and evading them after they pat around the edge of the court.  You can use eye from the kite location, drop down to the edge until the dogs pat around, then jump down for reset and tag.
---
Yeah, I rather like gear lasting a decent amount of time.  I've had four weapons total so far (and I'm 60): DM staff, SM staff, BRD staff, and currently Scholo staff.  It makes the upgrades you do get matter more.
---
Wow alliance have it easy for Ony attune
---
Man that’s awesome, the morning after my Stag do (NZ name for bachelor party) when the extended group had all gone home me and my groomsmen LAN’d the beta test for Vermintide.
---
For me that was honestly the best part of the whole weekend. Good on ya!
---
&gt; with their mouths open
---
Fuck it take an upvote
---
On the flipside, they get dismounted by shallow water.
---
I know! Love to run strat and scholo because they allow me to do some cc as a healer. 
---
I usually run to the entrance with the tank for Rattlegore for emergency shackle in case the tank accidentally pull a mob with Rattlegore.
---
Wow, that’s gnomist!
---
He's not dissing him he's just being humorous.
---
French is a great language.
---
Don't forget to equip your Parachute Cloak before you teleport!
---
You just run out of mana way too quickly to be worth anything.
---
Very fun in pvp but you cant play them like a mage, you still have to use other forms and the whole druid kit. In pve they are very gear dependent and do lower dps than almost every class/spec. You will have a hard time gearing up. 
---
But rank 10 isn't too hard to reach and that gear offers ok stats for any druid spec. It works really well if you play a true hybrid druid.
---
I play deep resto  shaman in raid/dungeon and I'd vouch for that.  Using the right combination of totem is an art. I have 36 keybind on my mouse alone and that doesn't even cover all my spells.  Managing my GCD when I put totem down and remembering which monster require me to put down tremor, disease, grounding, poison, windwall  totem is a task itself.  On top of that I always have Earth shock totem (lvl 1 for low mana and treat) to interrupt spells to prevent damage that in the end save me some mana (most of the time I end up with the most interrupt per pull). Frost shock to kill/slow mobs fleeing at low life, always a Flame shock on boss for a bit of extra dps, earthbind totem to mass slow everyone in case of a messy pull where casters/hunter have to run around for their life.  Oh yeah and avoiding casting near certain monster that have  some kind of interrupt that put my whole kit on silence. Learn to LoS casters you have aggro on because of treat generated by healing...
---
The list goes on and on
---
Meanwhile mage/priest don't bother buffind anymore (far from that day 1 where people were chasing you through 4 zones just to buff you back)
---
A warlock healthstone? What is that? A warlock Soulstone is 50/50.  And let's not start with Life tap
---
Rogue that use kick? impossible
---
A hunter that use his pet taunt to get a monster off of me to prevent push back and damage on healer... never seen that yet.
---
Edgemasters will give you about 3 hit against things 3 levels higher than you, which is good for threat but i dont know enough about tanking to say when its worth it. Theres no real lionheart equivalent (i.e. insanely good boe) for tanking, but i imagine some people use it for threat...it can make sense to use a fury prot tank and just kill stuff in 45 seco lnds with the threat that enables.
---
I'm guessing hunter is the best solo farmer for this?
---
I had never done any of the dungeons before classic and tanked my first time through many of them. I just told people "I've never been in this dungeon before, I can tank fine but tell me where to go and any boss info I need to know".
---
95% of the time there is someone chatty willing to tell you where to go and what's up
---
It's not that the hit rating was different, it's that they miscalculated the 6pc set bonus. It's only the difference of a few percent hit anyway, standard pre bis has you at like 13-15%.
---
But gameplay-wise, it's pretty much the same.
---
Yeah he people who play 5+ hours a day. Appeasing a minority of players who wear adult diapers and are unemployed is really bad strategy for a healthy MMO
---
I think they are usually LoSing him. I am not a hunter so I don't do the runs, but I have watched a fair amount. You are definitely right that they do it all the time when he is fairly close, though. Maybe because they make sure to have pet have a bit of aggro, like a growl or two on him?
---
Try riding in from Lakeshire or Kargath, depending on your faction, if they're camping the flight points.  Then you can all move together and  pvp as a group if necessary rather than individuals.
---
How do you test the batch timing like that?
---
Am I the only one that sees someone picking their nose?
---
Ringo is my bane.
---
I grouped with someone to do this escort, but there was horde, then alliance, then finally he was up, but I had to wait for my party to come back so I didn't turn in yet to make sure he was able to, of course as he comes back with a mob, another person runs the fuck in, so he activates it and I didn't get the credit. He offers to do it with me again and instead he dips when we are done. Whatever I'll do it myself. I literally got to maybe the base of that camp when my comp freezes and I have to log out.
---
That escort can suck it soooo hard.
---
Please link all the quality content you are creating for the sub.
---
The healer (priest) was 60, and I think the mage was as well.  The rogue was 58 or 59, so we had a pretty stacked group.  But surprisingly, I didn't have any threat issues at all, so could be I just got lucky with misses on Emp.
---
2% crit is nice but isn’t that big of a deal, whereas utility trinkets can completely change the outcome of a duel. 
---
Every person that PvPs in this game at a high level uses their judgement to swap gear as needed. When done properly you aren’t missing out on much when you have something equipped you don’t use and you gain massive cooldowns when you’re using the right gear. 
---
Idk man I’m just trying to help, if you don’t want to use utility items that’s on you.
---
Uhm, this one guy said what a horrible UI, and I just replied to say I agree with him. That’s it, just an opinion. Of course people can play any way they want! Am I telling them to stop playing? No... I’m just expressing my agreement with someone’s opinion that the above UI is horrible.
---
* Rank 1  = Tabard
---
* Rank 2 = Trinket
---
* Rank 3 = blue cloak (not good)
---
* Rank 4 = blue neck (not good)
---
* Rank 5 = blue bracers (not good)
---
* Rank 6 = Potions and entrance to Harry Potter's Secret PvP Chamber of Secrets in your capital city
---
* Rank 7 = Blue boots and gloves (good)
---
* Rank 8 = Blue Chest and legs (good)
---
* Rank 9 = God I wish I were rank 10 already, WTF is taking so long, are you kidding me right now???
---
* Rank 10 = Blue head and shoulders (good)
---
Rank 11 is a mount, but just stop here because you need to be able to shower regularly, get some sunlight, exercise, and not lose your family and friends.
---
OK you didn't listen, Rank 12+13 is epic version of the blue gear you got and a chronic case of hems, BO, and self loathing.
---
Rank 14 - lol, yeah right...cool you got a weapon. Was it worth it? No. Now go look in the mirror and cry because you're a fat piece of shit.

If the Warlock pulls aggro, that's what BoP is for

The best mages don’t see rag phase 2. And frankly, even the bad mages shouldn’t either with how much spell power is on gear right now.

&gt;**Feral TANK:** No one really needs you or likes you
---
OP have you ever used the lfg channel? Even for a minute?? How many groups do you see spamming "LF TANK ..." on your server per hour? On mine, it's at least 5.
---
Just being a tank is a golden ticket to pick and choose a spot in virtually any 5 man group you want. Its great.
---
Firery blaze and use seal of righteousness. It can proc off of procs. It can proc off of its own damage. The more procs per swing you can stack the more chances you will have to proc the spin to win. Good luck
---
He used ZA WARUDO to kill OP at the same time he leveled.
---
What's the name of that add-on? The one that gives all DE, Market price, etc
---
I have yet to see anyone banned, and someone is up there constantly, on every single server. Show me any enforcement of this rule on Classic in 2019.
---
Wtf I’ve been 60 over a month have like 200g
---
I didnt ask till later...lol
---
are you serious 40+ gold... I was there yesterday and got one and vendored it for 1g. Fuck I messed up.
---
Actually, when you reset instance and immediately enter it - it is always at same state. Mobs are always on exact same positions etc. So enter, spam macro, and you’ll have Jed targeted even before entering 1st room. 
---
Rest MV utility is very true, guiding through LBRS the way you skipped all that packs etc.
---
2 virgins brawling it out. What a beautiful sight
---
I’ve literally been camped until I log out, every day for the past two weeks. No matter what zone 50+ there are more horde than quest mobs. If I log in and spend 2 hours corpse running only to get killed again before I have the time to mount up. Is that “playable”?
---
Sword of omens is one of the few things that always makes me regret rolling ally. One of my favorite classic sword models
---
I never said there aren't good reasons to consider hunter also.
---
Icy veins has good dungeon walkthroughs along with maps, I usually have that open on my second screen until I remember how the dungeon goes.  If nothing else just read up on it while you're flying to the instance or waiting on others to arrive.
---
I originally played wow at the tail end of vanilla. My main character was a druid that like you I leveled feral until 40. 
---
At that time there wasn't all the readily accessible information that there is now. On top of that I was at the end of gradeschool/beginning of middle school so any "research" I did was basically thottbot searches for quests, dungeon loot etc.  
---
I hit level 40 and decided to go boomkin because I thought it looked cool. At first I had a lot of fun. I remember running ZF a bunch and filled all roles doing it. Tank, heals, and even dps on occasion. The single biggest problem I remember having is the extreme lack of mana/Regen. I mean seriously you will be drinking after almost every single mob kill. On top of that they really don't do much damage (lvl 40-50) at least so the leveling process when going solo felt painfully slow.  Like warrior slow. 
---
I only ever made it to 55 before TBC dropped at which point I switched back to feral because I honestly just couldn't take it anymore. I have zero personal experience of end game play with them so I won't speak on that. I will say it's a game so you should do whatever you enjoy. I have some good memories with it and it was a fun thing to do for a while but I wouldn't do it again and can't really reccomend it from my experience.
---
This is a good response.
---
3/3 Ruthlessness if you're Horde.
---
3/5 Improved Poisons if you're Alliance.
---
3/3 Improved Eviscerate if you like bigger numbers but lower overall DPS.
---
Lol my friend ran LBRS last night. Greater fire prot recipe dropped. Everyone hit greed. My rogue friend isn't alchemist, but he rolled need. Basically free 120g or so.
---
I feel like what you are not understanding, is that not many priest want to play shadow in raids for the exact reason you are saying. They will be last for loot and are useless. But many guild leaders and raid leaders want atleast one, so that the 4-5 warlocks can get a buff. But now explain to me how you would go about telling a priest in your guild they have to play a role they rather not play and are also not getting any loot or reward for sacrificing for the guild..
---
Id be all for an early release of warsong gulch a few weeks into phase 2, similar to the release of DM in phase 1. Just having any alternative to world pvp i think would be healthy for the servers. Just my humble opinion.
---
Sub:get out of here
---
Y u do dis
---
Well to be fair rogues in classic need to spend talent points to be able to sap and remain in stealth.  Sap with immediate body pull by the rogue tends to go wild pretty quick
---
The ending was my favorite. Epic moment, followed by ‘Whoops!’
---
Lmao as a fellow Alliance player stop being a pansy and JUST FIGHT! I’m looking forward to being outnumbered. Means there’s more enemies to kill
---
I just swap between them with keypresses. It's easy and makes tons of money, definitely worth it.
---
The agro reset in phase 2 is all about the fireballs. The first tank at the end of p1 will always get the first fireball. If the 2nd tank is 2nd on threat and they stack with the first, she will repeatedly try to hit him with fireball but because its also hitting the lowest threat(first tank) it doesnt apply the threat loss to the 2nd tank.
---
Im the guild MT and our OT tanks p1. We make sure I'm 2nd threat and stack in p2. Last lockout I ate 11 fireballs in a row and she came straight to me at p3 transition.
---
Dumb ass
---
Thanks!  you rock xD
---
That's partially why I switched from druid to warlock.
---
Playing with a group (be it in a dungeon or not, with friends or strangers) and trying to see how much you can do if you try your best.
---
I play druid, and the most fun I've had is some of open-world elite areas (stromgarde, jintha'alor), when the group pulls a bit much and I end up using my full toolkit, and we actually manage to survive. Especially when I did stromgarde, I ended up doing all roles at different times. Felt like peak druid.
---
It was a good death
---
Interesting.  Were you able to heal dungeons okay?  Assuming u did that, or did you tank them?
---
Yes, I'm going to allow it
---
I’m glad I’m not in your guilds loot council. LOL
---
Yup!
---
I'm Ed
---
OP wishes it was a hooker as he cries in Orcish.
---
Moonking. Best oomkin character name,
---
lock, sm/ruin
---
You have something like 20 days played just in strat and LBRS? Hmmm
---
Counterspell and sheep are some of my favorite tools. I tend to go on the fly, but if the sheep breaks twice I'm going balls to the wall with the warlocks and rogues. 
---
Counterspell is super important in Strat Live, lots of healing going on in that dungeon.
---
.... and get MS resisted in the middle of DM - priceless.
---
Equal tenure and guild contributions it should go to the H priests.
---
Alright, so: 
---
* Imp. Regrowth: Crit is a mixed bag for healers. Nice, yes; high priority, not really. Especially with regrowth, which is half a HoT (and therefore does not benefit from crit), and a spell you are usually not downranking. So, a crit might mean a lot of extra overhealing, which is kinda pointless. And if you are trying to flash heal a tank low enough that a crit would make it all the way through, then you probably aren't using regrowth and are instead using swiftmend or NS+HT, or are just casting HT and expecting the priests to flash heal or precast through it.
---
* Swiftmend, while a very powerful instant speed heal, it uses a *ton* of mana and requires you to have a regrow/reju already active. This means that your one druid tank healer, who is spamming reju, actually needs to have this ability. 3x resto druids won't benefit a ton from all having swiftmend, unless they are dying frequently and swapping MT heals (they shouldn't be doing that). Again, it's a "only 1 person needs to use this" type of talent, and it's effectively a 10 point sink to get it. Very arguably not worth it.
---
* Gift of nature: I *could* be wrong on this but would be surprised... It should only be base spell healing and not account for +healing on gear. That is how it works for the priest talent with the exact same wording. While *nice* pre-60 when you don't have a ton of +healing and are not downranking much, when you have 600 +healing and are downranking your HT's for 90% of your healing, it's pretty useless.
---
* Lastly, you didn't list the threat talents, which are the most useless out of all the talents you have picked up. You can justify uses for imp regrow, swiftmend, imp reju... But the threat just shouldn't be an issue outside of 5-mans, and even then it shouldn't be all that critical unless the tank is *really* struggling.
---
So, you're gaining some minimal buffs to resto, that can really be alleviated by communicating with the 1-3 other druids in your raid group and figuring out which roles you should all have. Remember, 10% better efficiency means 10% more healing you can put out in a fight, and 20% more mana means slightly less than 20% more healing you can put out in a fight; and both of these are huge benefits when healers get double fireball insta-gibbed or knocked into lava. Slightly better reju/regrow just don't have the same weight that a shitload more HT casts have.
---
Now, with all that said, *at least one druid should have swiftmend/imp reju*. So:
---
* If you are the one, maybe two, druid(s) designated for swiftmend/reju
---
* You have zero interest in PvP
---
* You don't want to tank in dungeons, or off tank raids whatsoever
---
* You truly do not care about any solo content and just want to raid heal
---
Then I can see you justifying 0/0/51. *Somebody* should take swiftmend, and the other 20 points in feral/balance aren't going to do a ton outside of solo content or PvP healing (although they are very good for those). However, it seems odd that you'd want to do strictly healing and no versatility on a class that is designed to have versatility as it's key feature.
---
Tanking in fury or arms is completely doable. I tanked UBRS as Fury.
---
You play with some really shitty tanks, guy.
---
I am just trying to garner discussion on the pros and cons of swapping out these trinkets.
---
learn rank 2
---
Frost/Fire just doesnt synergize very well. Your talents are going into completely different spells that you wont be able to use simultaneously. Fire mages are just trying to get crits and burst as fast as possible, frost mages are trying to kite as much as possible with slows and get damage of Frostbite. Their best talents dont crossover to the other and both of them lose a lot of potential but not going deeper in their own trees and not getting some better Arcane talents
---
Give Rextroy the credit he deserves in the video title/thumbnail you content-leaching clown
---
If you prefer immersion over efficiency, don't use leveling guides much. It's awesome to discover new areas of the world for the first time. 
---
Questing is the way to go because in addition to just killing monsters you kinda help the quest givers in various ways, they give you experience points for faster leveling, and rewards. Soon you'll be moving to a new area because you "outgrow" quests and monsters in yours. Silverpine Forest is nearby and it looks kinda similar, or you can go by a zeppelin (and then walk some) to the Barrens which is like savanna in Africa. You can do both too of course.
---
Also starting from a few more levels you can fight in a team in dungeons. Monsters there are harder than usual but there are 5 players in a team, and loot is cool. The team leader, the tank, takes hits from monsters, you as a mage and 2 others deal damage to them, and the raining guy heals everyone else. People are often looking for more others for these teams in the chat, so you won't miss those dungeons.
---
Yeah so as an alliance I can't really call you a dick for that. I knock rogues off of mining nodes all of the time and take them for myself.
---
....except in those bug tunnels, you guys can have those. NO SPANK YOU!
---
I reported a fishing bot for 3 days in a row. It was gone the 4th day, and I haven't seen it back in weeks.
---
That's amazing lol built one person at a time, the guild in in now is pretty big over 100 people online sometimes. All above LVL 50 so I guess it won't be long to find a spot. I havnt even started running end game dungeons for pre raid bis cause no one will take a shadow priest lol
---
Nope u don’t even need a shield for most of that content either.
---
Charge&gt;sweeping strikes (if you have it)&gt;Berserker Stance&gt; Whirlwind&gt; Berserker Rage&gt; Defensive Stance  
---
Then tab through and throw up your sunders/revenge.  
---
If everyone is doing what they're supposed to do, the skull should die before it has a chance to do any real damage, you don't need to worry about keeping aggro on it. Your goal at the beginning of the pull is to keep everything off of the healer; the dps aren't real people, they don't count.
---
I wouldn’t tell them that. I’d tell them to play the role they want to play, lol. If they want to heal, heal. You don’t have to have a shadow priest. Hell they can even still get the spell power gear later to play shadow in pvp, and they’ll get an eye of divinity and by extension Anathema. 
---
However, if they choose to play shadow because that’s what they want to play I’m still not going to gear them up first, and they’d know that well in advance of rolling shadow. It’s just not what’s best for the whole guild.
---
And I’m expressing my opinion.
---
/pat
---
When you say that those 2 talents are dependant on faction, im assuming it has something to do with playing alongisde shamans or palladins?
---
WC mage here, can confirm.
---
Urist McKilledUsAll cancels drink: doomed.
---
There was two players named wifey and hubby questing in STV, so my friend and I killed hubby, but not wifey, and just /whistled at her. 
---
We did it probably 3 or 4x before she made a rude gesture and hearthed. 
---
I still think it’s funny.
---
Can I tell you about Eye of Kilrog and how I love it?
---
Buying gold being popular = gold farmers/bots in every farmable zone and hackers trying to get into your account in every possible way. It also inflates the economy an absolute fuck load making it harder for people that don't buy gold.
---
Yeah, and if a Rogue pulls, never taunt from him, he can vanish or evasion or whatever else.
---
My biggest is not turning it into a job, any time i've down that I burn out fast.
---
Just keep doing things as I want and find people in that mode as well. I don't need to min/max and clear everything as fast as humanely possible and if we wipe because we are too laid back so be it if the people i'm playing with are fun it doesn't matter to me.
---
Is that robe also bis for balance/resto druids?
---
Ty brother. I feel justified now
---
Warlock:  Use only two spells and then wand
---
Mage:  Lists off entire spell book.
---
Only reason I didn’t upvote
---
Hey, I'm planning on being my guild's main tank. I've got a solid Fire Resistance set now with around 236 (which I've heard is a fairly good place to be to tank Rag (with the Shaman totem and maybe even the BRS Fire Rez buff). I'm also starting to build up my Nature and Frost resistance sets, with a few pieces here and there in preparation for AQ40 and Naxx. What I'm curious about is if there is any reason to collect Arcane or Shadow resistance? Are there any tough encounters where those are a must so I can make sure to need on Arcane/Shadow rez gear ahead of time?
---
Alliance rogues use poisons on both weapons.
---
Horde rogues use windfury totem buffs on their MH and poison on their OH weapon.
---
That would be so amazing
---
So you are saving that 55-60 I will be coasting as everyone needs a tank? Does re-speccing protection make a lot of sense?
---
Sorry for the typo guys. Been suffering a migraine for a few hours
---
It’s funny, they refer to druids as Jack-of-All-Trades. But they say a Jack-of-All-Trades is a master of none.
---
I disagree with that and would argue a Jack-of-All-Trades is a master of adaptation.
---
However there’s nothing to adapt to when all is well I suppose lol.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
What class are you?
---
Guessing warlock or mage for hat?
---
Can't you just buy a close enough "of shadow/of frost" green from the AH?
---
BiS doesn't matter so much and there's a lot of alternatives that are close enough (or in some cases better for pure damage if the rest of your gear has some survivability) around.
---
Sorry, what’s MC got to do with it?
---
Is there a way to turn it off?
---
Healed fine. I took Divine Intellect and Spiritual focus and you have more than enough mana for dungeons. Did not tank, though I probably could have. Just never fell that way.
---
I wish you had a better perspective on poverty. The fact that you have no empathy for it at all makes me sad.
---
Hmm... I dont think anyones using growl though? It makes it very risky to try and pull that much threat off of Gordok and not get your pet killed.
---
It certainly is NOT just LoS, because I do that everytime. I think it might be possible that I need to get a few auto-attacks on Gordok with my pet though, as I usually do the alternative pull where I have my pet attack Chorush instead. So perhaps I need to get my pet to attack Chorush and Gordok at least once to not get water agro.
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Human's don't have natural stealth detection with perception, I think that came in bc maybe. As of now it is a spell that greatly increases detection for a short period of time.
---
ah, right.  thank you sir
---
How sick would it be if Blackrock Depths, Lower Blackrock Spire, Upper Blackrock Spire, Molten Core, AND Blackwing Lair were all in the same instance, divided only by doorways, not portals.
---
Do you mind equipping some spell power gear and seeing if it scales to spell power?
---
I'm hearing conflicting reports.
---
Never said otherwise. Comments exist in a thread. Read the thread. He's saying *that's why people think warriors are greedy.*
---
No one's saying it doesn't happen. The argument is that's not why people think warriors are greedy.
---
Yes but you’re also putting words in my mouth, which is not cool
---
Yes, yes!  Release your anger and let hatred flow through you!  They are different from us, and it is useless to try to talking to them as they do not understand reason nor keep faith.  They have no honour, as they only respect power and mindless violence, and they only hunger for our lives and our homes.  They live in the shadows and turn away from the Light!  Look how they embrace the Forsaken and glorify death. They are no different from the Scourge!
---
Kill them, crush them, obliterate them!  They are vermin to be erased from our pure, clean world and a disease upon Azeroth.  Their very existence is a sin against the living, and the souls of the fallen of Lordaeron, Theramore, and Teldrasil call out for vengeance!  Do not spare the young, the females, the old, no one!  Just as they did not spare us when they invaded our lands, burned our fields, and killed our families, our parents, our friends, *our children*!
---
It is time, my brothers and sisters, to cleanse this land of the Horde!  Swear upon this day, this dawn, a solemn oath to let none of this disgusting, evil, *plague* of Horde scum live to see another day.  Let this sunset be their final one as they die beneath our just and holy crusade, for today, we fight for us, for our families, and for our future!
---
For the Alliance!  Charge!
---
You really need to pump those numbers.
---
I want to give more awareness to shadowpanther.net. Not only does he have a formula for PvP gear (so stam actually has some value), but you can see the top list of items for each slot instead of just the theoretical best single item for each slot. I’m not going to pass on the handful of other viable shoulder slot items just because they’re not BiS. They might still be better than my greens of the monkey.
---
Isn’t a mages entire dps rotation basically just frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt? lmao
---
This is true. The reason is that the biggest guilds on Horde are progress oriented and are focusing on raid rewards and generating pve resources like consumes, gold etc.
---
Once phase 2 is out and PvP is rewarded, you'll see a massive outpouring of PvP from Horde.
---
It'd be cool, but it'd also take a while to load.
---
No need to patronize the LGTBQ community. This has no place here bigot
---
150dps for a fresh 60 vs 300dps for a pre-raid bis gearset.
---
I thought it was the Traveler's Backpack icon
---
Hey this is what I needed. I’ll just stick with feral. Thanks for your experience!
---
Oh I'm going to fight them, but the fun level of pvp is greatly reduced when every fight boils down to a 3v1 because everyone (on both sides) is just looking for that gank.
---
MoP, but it was too late. Class homogenization ran deep already
---
I don’t need to have a rez if I just keep everyone alive, amirite?!
---
My point is Hunter is the best and Rogue is a fairly slow leveler 1-35. You could consider Warlock for summon too, and you’re not compromising as much leveling speed.
---
Maraudon is also dangerous it seems. Healed it last night as a ret paladin no problem but too many pulls included creeps with AoE stuns or silences. At least I had a protect paladin tanking so my downtime was the same as his for the most part.
---
Sure, but like I said if he is horde I don't know if it's worth the time to go grab it when his issue is just that his current pet has no growl ability at all.
---
Still like 400g on my server, grobbulus
---
I've sold my last two for 450g and the ones before that 350g. It difficult to farm on PvP servers and is only ramping up, the walk back if you die is at least 3min 40 sec. You also cant kill 20 an hour that are all slayers/initiates, some of them will be manastalkers which dont drop eye. 
---
And just cause it's a 1% drop rate doesn't mean you'll ever get it. So a priest only farms so much before they say fuck it and buy it, were talking about one of the best weapons in the game theyre about to have. I'm on Bigglesworth and they're all listed for over 500g Horde side. Mostly because you have to pvp so much to farm them now. I can't see myself selling it under 400g.
---
i don't understand why someone would just want to spam a spell and not help w cc. seems so boring to play on autopilot.
---
Warlocks are one of the best solo farming classes. I think your best option is either Mara farming or DM East farming but you'd have to ask an actual warlock which is better
---
Exactly!
---
Anyway, we have a rez. Once every 30 minutes. That should be plenty, right? Right!
---
As Mage it can be huge. When I just hit 60 I would barely do like 230 DPS on Ragnaros. Last night I did 523 DPS.
---
Same here *for the horde*
---
And Druid.
---
Duh
---
Shout out to Linken's Boomerang when it successfully disarms gun/bow mobs and they run right up to our group.
---
No changes you knew what you were getting into.
---
Tbc classic you will be a god
---
Yeah not enough content. Replayability is ok at best. I don't think pvp will do it for me. Had a good run but after a couple of raids I burnt out.
---
You can bait out mistakes pretty easily having people overestimate what they can do in a given situation. Like if 2 people are rolling up on a gnome warrior defending stables they are probably more inclined to rush in and try to down him as quickly as possible than if they know there is also a priest chilling right there ready to heal/dps as well. It doesn't flat out win you games but keeps tempo in your favor when you are able to wipe a few off the board briefly without trading anything back.
---
Seduce them when they open on you
---
Layering increases max server population. That's one of the main reasons it was put in.
---
Where do you read rank 7, 8 and 10 (rare set) is available on phase 2 ? The only mention here is "pvp gear" which could mean either both rare sets and epic sets or only epic sets with a stats adjustment on phase 5 (i.e HWL cast weapon is as good as AQ instead of Mageblade)
---
They have a 3% spell crit aura, right? Put them in a group with 4 mages and I bet the group's DPS would go up enough to justify keeping them around.
---
I'm a little confused, are you saying that Survival Hunter is good? Hard to play against?
---
I dont care much about what you can do in retail. Just thinking out loud what could have been and didnt
---
The shadow priest reached out to us first saying he'd really like it since he'll be no-life grinding honor for the pvp sets since they are better for pve than the gear available from MC and Anathema would help a lot for that.
---
This is spriest bis so posting here so I can check this out later. Hope spriests can solo!
---
Advertised lava jump emp runs the other night. Got a guy to join. He asks what a lava jump run is, we explain that we will basically be doing arena then incendius and skipping straight to emp. He says cool. We lava jump and get to torch room. He starts asking when we will do golem Lord. What? That's not part of the run. If you want it we can go that route next time if you're doing a quest or need plans but this group isn't farming it. Dude bails. Whatever, clear emp with 4 people and realize a 3rd DPS isn't actually necessary.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Thats pretty much been my guilds position. Get 60 by phase 2, get geared, prepare to crush in phase 2. We'll see how it plays out.
---
So queue times will increase?
---
Because we're doing the easy raids. DW tank Patchwerk.
---
Nah you’re overreacting and being a dick. Your response was valid for both guys but you only agonized one of them
---
Drinking mana pots in between fire pots is tough business. Well I guess you have to sheep stuff sometimes too.
---
So you play with two daggers? This sounds exactly like how I want to play. Do you have improved gouge and improved backstab in combat, and improved ambush in subtley?
---
I'm not patronizing anyone. The only one patronizing anyone here is you. Don't call me a bigot.
---
If by endgame dungeons you mean raids then Holy Shield is kinda good yes. For 5-10 mans and Onyxia you don't need it. But honestly there are better main tanks than Paladins even with the high threat, so you shouldn't try to MT but rather try to stay hybrid like I did. If you are 20/31 you are missing 5% spell crit which noticeably makes you a worse raid healer.
---
I guess you can even tank MC with my build but I haven't done it.
---
Your 3rd point is the nail in the coffin. I was not aware that gift of nature was only base healing. I have a shite ton of +healing gear that is not getting buffed by that. So now that I'm past 0/0/51. Which of the two, mg or hotw should I go with knowing what you know about my play style? I will eventually pvp alterac and warsong, but my first love is dungeon &amp; raid healing
---
Well you only get Flametongue Totem at 28, giving all of a four level period to use it. Windwall prevents ranged damage and comes after windfury, so nothing really lost there.
---
Slow season for me too. I work for the government, so all kinds of paid holidays and long weekends. Forget thanksgiving food though, all terribad. I prefer to get my calories from alcohol.
---
Hey you, you‘re finally awake.
---
WoW has a majority trash community.  Retail is 1000 times worse to.

&gt;Even on a PVP server, I cannot comprehend how someone could spend days on their level 60 character one shotting other people trying to get through a few quests in Redridge or Duskwood or STV after a long day at work.
---
It's fun 
---
&gt;I'm trying to escape from the prevalent sadism and selfishness I observe on a daily basis in the real world only to end up sharing a game world with people that get pleasure from being someone else's misfortune.
---
Try killing some noobs
---
[Nope.](https://imgur.com/a/KE4VFq0) The main reason behind layering was to prevent 15.000 players from trying to compete for boars and wolves in the same starting zones.
---
You friend, have good taste.
---
Someone whispered the word "fuck" in the chat panel and it didn't turn it into @!#$, how do you do that?
---
Yeah I just worded it wrong, mostly meant they have built in stealth detection with a cooldown. People are splitting hairs over this.
---
Getting a Flurry Axe is the biggest upgrade you can make because then you have enough mana with the high attackspeed and Seal of Wisdom. If I would have to gear my prot paladin again I'd go for that first.
---
Just run some Scholo and get the Deathborne set, it's pretty much pre BiS for prots. After that T1 is BiS because the stats are so high and you don't need +Defense if you are not MT.
---
I thought it was kinda gay.
---
I leveled as subtlety during TBC. Obviously, the talent tree was cleaned up a bit by that point, but I still felt like the advantage I gained by having Camouflage, Elusiveness, Improved Sap, and the super beastly Ambushes was more enjoyable and well worth the trade-off of having lower sustained damage.
---
You are correct. Hence for the above macro, 1 press is sufficient, provided you have enough energy. Otherwise only the first one will be casted.
---
I'd rather not raid than play with people like that. Luckily I have options.
---
Check your server discord for MC/Ony PUGs
---
The thing I disliked the most about PvP during classic was the gear.  You had to raid PVE to be geared for PVP.  I did fine in early classic because of the PvP vendor rewards you get from faction, etc., but over time it was very noticeable.  I left the game until BC, then got hooked for years.  :)
---
At the back of the building you can just walk in as a gnome, I used it to drink up at one point when horde were hunting me
---
For most people that's the WoW Dream.
---
Wait is there a built in range checker? I can’t get one to pop up from DBM
---
100% not grey. Can, has, and will ban for it
---
Well I’m not gonna respond to everyone - that’s too much time. I said my peace.
---
For sure we don’t have many upgrades in BWL. However come AQ 40 and Naxx we start getting upgrades again. So as your guild has BWL on farm Yeah the warriors will outpace you. But until then a T1 warrior is about on par with you.
---
You'd think so, but the spell crit is honestly negligible compared to just having a group of 5 mages instead. Winter's Chill and Ignite provide enough group DPS for mages to the point that spell crit just ends up being less worth it.
---
“What? You refuse to carry my dead weight through the instance, and you require some level of validation that I will contribute to the success of this party?  ELITIST!”
---
I never really understood the idea.  To me it just seems like entitlement to expect to just show up and win prizes for no effort.  Those who get upset about tools that at least help to evaluate the performance of people prior to inviting them are very likely the types of players that I don’t want to pay with, so it kind of works itself out.
---
Turns out when you put real-life people into a game world, you tend to get real-life problems. You're not going to avoid selfishness unless you only play with very good friends. That holds true no matter where you go, in gaming or in life.
---
I'm with ya pretty much 100%. I think the difference is that I expect there to be assholes and I pride myself with standing out from them.
---
I'm a holy priest. I *love* helping people. I often will spend literally hours just helping people, sometimes with literally zero in-game gain. Hillsbrad farm? Spent many nights around there just healing all the people doing their quests. The pirate cove in Tanaris? Help all the people there for hours. There's parties there questing and I am running around healing them &amp; wanding their mobs.
---
I'm Horde and I'll even stop to help Alliance. I'll take mobs away from Alliance who are overwhelmed. If they're not in the middle of something I'll emote them, and then Mind Control them to give them Fortitude buff. Sometimes it's just me and one other Alliance in the area and we take turn helping each other kill mobs.
---
After I'm done with quests I stay around to make sure everyone else finishes their drops. Healer doesn't leave early. "I really appreciate ya" someone told me the other day. All day. 
---
I'm a friendly dungeon mate and I have a long list of friends I've made on the server who invite me to their groups. 
---
TLDR: maybe focus a little less on the negative and use that energy to be the positive. People notice the positive.  You *will* stand out.
---
Also on Rattlegore, hoping to get the eye of divinity tonight. Bought my eye of shadow for 300g after spending 5 hours farming it with a warrior buddy
---
Go hotw to be flexible, you'll be able to tank or heal dungeons and mc.
---
Pretty sure it will work from where you are mind visioned. 
---
I can test with farsight tonight... It works with tracking herb nodes and herbalism.
---
Which is an odd mentality for people to be pushing given most fights in MC are lasting what... 45 seconds?
---
Was Oomkin really THAT bad with mana?
---
make sure the macro will apply to current target if your mouse is not hovering over a legitimate target, outside that is just becomes muscle memory in moving your mouse around.
---
I went on a pvp server because that's what my real friends wanted.  They're playing less than me and I find myself solo lvling most of the time.   Round lvl 29 - 40 I got ganked on a regular basis and was considering restarting on a PVE realm.  But I've noticed recently a lot less ganking and occasional helpfulness from the other faction.  And even as an undead rogue I don't fight unless provoked, I'm finding emote joking with the other faction a lot of fun.  I still get ganked now and again but when I don't retaliate or show any signs of frustration they quickly move on. I hope you find fellow players who are nice and start to enjoy it again as there is a lot of fun to be had.
---
Well gathering proffessions and skinning are always good money for straight vendoring for some cash.
---
Interesting. Thanks for this. I had always thought it did increase max server pop, and then I was fully convinced of that when the first queue that my server had in several weeks came on the exact day that my server dropped to one layer for the first time. This was followed by small queues on the next couple days as well. And it wasn't the "hype" because my server (Stalagg) was put on one layer without an announcement or anything. That seems like a very large coincidence and because that is a ticket and not an actual blue post I'm gonna stay convinced that layering does have some effect on max server pop.
---
Opened this thread expecting it to be biggest dick in terms of most badass, not most asshole, for some reason.
---
Wrong person to ask fella, I didnćt make it past 40, I stopped there. It was a burnout because of several factors, but the plan was to run EM until I get enough crit chance then switch to NS as EM is then pointless. It really all depends on what you want to do, really. If you plan to be a full DPS, until you get geared EM. If you plan to be a semi healer, NS. One thing is for sure, when I return for the endgame I'll definitely get NS.
---
wow, grats
---
Found the guy who's never even talked to a woman without giving out his credit card number first.
---
notice that the highest MAEP value armor set is the 6 pc SC with the 2 pc DS?... 
---
yea. might want to go back over those before you start talking about not using devilsaur, and why would you spend loads? easy farm.
---
What happens if someone prefers frost for pvp?
---
&gt; Hunter was the last class added.
---
This probably explains why there is almost no hunter specific loot in dungeons...
---
that is less impressive of you and more concerning of the other healers
---
You can't single pull these anymore, you have to fight all 3 at once. I solo'd it on my Shaman the first time by de-aggroing the two adds, but on an alt after the mob leashing change I needed to party for it.
---
Thanks for the answer. 
---
I like to experiment a lot, and i was also thinking to try a Fury - Prot build just to ligthen up my curiosity appetite. 
---
This game is just too vast to follow one prescribed build.
---
What exactly are they doing? I googled for info last night and found nothing major. For me, they'd have to be making huge fundamental changes. Reducing number of difficulties, scrapping titanfirge gear, bringing back class spells they removed, no longer require timed mythic + runs to advance through the week... and a bunch of other things. 
---
The only one I read related to my concerns was class spells revamp and there was zero information I found of what that means. My guess, not even close enough to be acceptable. I have absolutely no plans to buy the expansion. If I need a change from Classic, I'll play Cyberpunk, some VR games, or new RPGs.
---
Conversely, I've found the community -overall and as a whole- quite awesome! At least on Grobbulus (#GrobSquad). Of course there are asshats and others out there who generally hate life and only find happiness when they can make other people have a bad time, but man! I pass by a fellow player and nearly always receive a buff (even if it's a 'lock and all he has to give is underwater breathing or detect invisibility). Mages are always handing out free water. Finding a questing buddy for this or that is always easy and near instantaneous. I could go on and on about the absolute BLAST I am having playing this game again. Sorry you've had a bad time, but I absolutely cannot relate!
---
I was lvl 45 in Vanilla when the honor system was released.  Still had a blast.
---
I find dungeon runs to be the best because all the random greys and green/blues you can’t use really add up. But I’m very opposed to mindless grinding in terms of the fun factor so others will have suggestions for if you just want to turn your brain off and grind.
---
No, but the treatment from ignorant people can do that. The perception of "jack of all trades, but ~~master of none~~ can't do any of them" is pretty strong amongst the elitist communities.
---
Even here, people instantly point out that all world firsts here on Classic has zero druids in them. And point to that as evidence that druids are non-factors in the game.
---
I got my flu shot, sorry bout the rest of these jerkfaces.
---
I masturbate to this fucks and I get off on the smexy spine.
---
Dude DotA and footies kicks ass!!!
---
They're Zya and Zyk, so close.
---
I'll save your replies cos oh boy this is a lot of content and warrior-knowledge that will be useful later! I can't thank you enough dude.
---
Probably spiked in price because p2 is fast approaching. I bought mine a couple weeks ago for 295g. Now I 'm seeing prices between 400-500g. Certainly overpriced, but about to become much harder to farm..
---
The full saying is actually... Jack of all trades and master of none, but often times better than a master of one.  Fits nicely in what you are saying :)
---
Honestly I learned it originally with the 2 step method and someone told me “dude you can just jump in the lava” annddddd
---
Voila
---
Consecrate to tag everyone amirite?
---
Right? So many refi's.
---
So...so many
---
You could start your own group and not reserve items.
---
Periodically I will go out and about and hand out 8/10 slot bags (and sometimes money) to random warriors.
---
Lmao aggressively casual. Same people who say min-maxers are the devil right?
---
lvl 60 warlock here with the SM Dagger, lol.
---
So setup your own JedRend runs.  And that's why I stick with guild.  Little loot drama
---
So you rather be one shot by a level 60 that you have no chance of ever catching up too than twinking?
---
FYI when you twink at say level 19, you have to turn of your XP gain at a battlemaster allowing you to stay at level 19 and when you do that you only go up against other players who have also done that meaning...other twinks. So yeah.
---
as well as what you said.. leatrix maps also reveals unexplored areas, show class colored group icons on map (resizeable), enlarge player arrow, show flight points, show boat harbors, show tram stations, rescale the map, set map transparency, show zone level ranges, show dungeon level ranges, show minimum fishing skill requirements, lets you zoom in and out of the map, remembers the zoom level when toggling the map, lets you move the map frame, lets you hide the town and city icons, show coordinates and remove the map border for a truly sexy experience!
---
leatrix maps is best map addon for classic
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-maps-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-maps-classic)
---
got 1 from a buddy for 400G
---
and one was rnd drop in BRD
---
"standard" BiS isn't very standard... b/c they don't understand the math though, that's kind of the point. Even if you don't use 6 pc, the BiS lists are trash b/c they would have you running 14% hit or greater, and 316 dagger (if dagger) over higher weighted stats on other pieces (such as the Ancient Bone Bow over Satyr Bow).
---
Not understanding mechanics or stat weights is killing people's dps.
---
I’ve attacked people my own level that have tried to run while spamming /hug, so the opposite end of the spectrum exists too.
---
no its not, a fury or rogue shits on hunter.
---
hunter is really only good in bad melee fights.
---
Glad I could help
---
I've had a similar ui in the past. Only thing I might recommend would be to scale it down a little so it takes up a little less space
---
[Starter gear, low crit/hit](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVcuVfMqoZVzjb0x)
---
[Hit capped, well geared](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVcuVfMqZZVzLx0xo)
---
You'll probably stay Elemental Mastery for a long time. The fact that it works for two casts makes chain lightning+shock a godly combo.
---
19 rogue !
---
Yeah that's big yikes.
---
Not sure how I'd feel in that situation. MC is a cake walk, bwl might end up being that way too, but if it isn't then I'm concerned to be the top dps right now on a hunter.
---
I'm a bit too sensitive in real life, but I've been online since I was an adolescent in the late 90s. Basically, I've seen some shit! That has given me a thick skin for online crap. So I tend to ignore them. I'll leave general chat when it annoys me enough.
---
As for PvP, I expect it honestly. It was bad in vanilla, but not nearly to the extent it is here. Because here we have servers with over triple the numbers of the highest pop vanilla realms. I mean Kern from Blizzard said vanilla realms had 2500-3000 maximum. Now we've got realms with over 10000 online on just one faction alone. This means we see it much more and you can't escape it. Especially if you're on a realm like mine. I'm horde on a PvP realm with 80% alliance to 20% horde. It's brutal. You won't make it to BRD without corpse hopping multiple times. Same with Dire Maul. It's not fun. But I'm on a PvP server so it's on me in the end.
---
For those of us on PvE servers Phase 2 is basically keyrings, so woo!
---
Thank you
---
bro yes REFI's
---
That mob has a lot of health. You are better off nuking 1, jumping off the ledge to bug the others, run back, do the same with the other, then you have just the named alone. Solo'd it on my priest that way using MC.
---
Well, after those two (quite important) logistical constraints were imposed, it was based on lore. But as you state, it's about gameplay and balance to that point.
---
Retail only. Keep classic as original as possible.
---
As a hybrid engineering druid who knows how to play the class well, even when I am undergeared, I lose 0 match ups.
---
It is.
---
I said rely
---
Not talk
---
That version of wow you have to rely on others too
---
Wtf how is 3% crit only 10 dps that seems super low.
---
Fun fact - Warcraft was developed to be a Warhammer game but Blizzard failed to secure licensing rights from Games Workshop. Best failure they ever made in retrospect.
---
Yes for retail. I heard there giving free expantion too you if you hit 60 in classic. Not sure just a rumor.
---
My first ever award
---
Thank you wealthy stranger!
---
If they're doing a full run it isn't snobbery but practical. Lvl and hit chance matter a lot.
---
My Paladin alt is parked in Scarlet Monastery because I'm sick of questing after doing all the same quests on my main already. So, between finding groups, I hang out in the lobby, where naturally tons of Horde come and go. My favorite is to spam /hello at them and sometimes they'll emote back but when someone starts attacking me I just use my bubble and /no at them and slink backwards into the entrance of whatever instance so I don't get murdered when my bubble is up. 
---
Anyway, probably the most fun I've had leveling a character lol
---
Unless you are the healer! But then we're back to that part where you just don't let anybody die in the first place :D
---
No one lets you roll on spell damage/crit gear :(
---
Omfg the comments in the thread are hilarious.
---
I love you too kind stranger.
---
Our power lies not in any sort of misguided quest to change/better other people, but in the way we work with our own reactions to things that are completely out of control (and by and large, just none of our business)
---
That said, I'm going to give you my own unsolicited advice =)
---
Your sensitivity is a good thing. It's not your problem; it's an asset. Your problem is that you are intellectually/emotionally irresponsible. Learn to be more responsible. When someone else does something insensitive, it's not your problem, your reaction is your problem. You are the cause of the problem. And you are also the solution.
---
Its all hunter loot. Especially the weapons.
---
Happy I could help friend
---
dungeons and raids are 2 different things
---
I couldn't keep watching this vid because of that horrid horrid UI.
---
I'm happy your happy
---
Yeah true that might happen. But I’m going to team up with guildies and make hit and run death squads
---
Thunderclap is not a good option for its rage cost. Battle/demo are better aoe and sunder/revenge on each target should enough if dps isn't split. If dps is split you will need to constantly switch and have taunt and mocking blow ready
---
Ha! Never had heard it all, thank you!
---
I mean, it should be noted that while Feral dps falls off hard and stays bad for p much the remainder of Classic, bears are still okay. There's plenty of weird gear that gets made pretty much exclusively for bear tanks, like all the leather with very high stamina. Just look at something like Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark, or Guise of the Devourer, or Gloves of the Hidden Temple. While you do lag behind equivalently geared warriors, you don't ever lag that far behind. The issues more stem from how little defence feral tanks can ever get their hands on. This is partially made up by the fact feral tanks have the highest tps, so we don't necessarily need as much threat gear, but just dealing less damage isn't the hottest.
---
Feral Tanks still make a perfectly fine offtank all the way to Naxx though, and can even maintank sometimes in Naxxramas. It's just a bit harder and requires more gear than equivalent warriors.
---
but 30 seconds is still much faster than WotF
---
I read your comment as
---
"I just try to boyfriend who I can..."
---
What is wrong with me lol
---
Is there any class with a fun dps rotation? 1 button is bad but all rotations seem real simple
---
Do we really know anything
---
Yes, let's do this!
---
&gt; no one uses that
---
Because nobody wants a group finding system 😜
---
Some of it is on Cruel Barb for how good it is, absolutely. I just feel that the whole reason upgrades feel good should be because you have been using the same piece of gear for 15+ levels.
---
Sounds like a server imbalance problem and has nothing to do with phase 2. You’re the first person I’ve heard say they’ve been camped for hours every day, assuming you’re telling the whole truth
---
To be honest I experience the most random aggro chains due to drinking when not right up against the pillar and also when against the mage style cho. Changing aspects can also reaggro the king.
---
At any rate I usually start drinking as the King hits the upward ramp. With crystal water thats more than enough to be well and full for full unloads. If you bait the charge with your pet you can also get like 2 extra auto attacks a sting and a multi in on him as he comes on you. My fastest consistent consecutive runs is ~16minutes but theres a knife edge to walk between rushing and dying. One death is a huge efficiency loss.
---
The largest time saver is combining the bug/ogre pack pull and the last gaurd dog/ogre pulls to get to the arena. If you time it right you don't even have to kill the dog pet as you fight the boss.
---
Marry me
---
If you're in a raid guild with loot council, you should probably find a new guild.
---
Yes. Gul'Dan was probing Medivhs mind for the location of the tomb of sargeras. That does not mean that Gul'Dan was controlling Medivh or gave Medivh the powers and knowledge of a warlock. Gul'Dan was trying to be sneaky for his quest for power. It was still the knowledge of banishing demons from the guardian of trisfal and Sargeras himself that made Medivh a warlock too after he was initially a mage. You think Gul'Dan was strong enough to control Medivh who was possessed with the spirit of Sargeras who was the one to contact Gul'Dan and show him how to build the dark portal in the first place? Gul'Dan learned his warlock powers from  Kil'Jaeden
---
I had a lvl 40 rogue in booty bay try to distract me into the water while I was running for the boat, guess they thought I was auto running and not paying attention. 
---
When I didn't run into the lava they clapped excitedly for me then they got on the boat and started spamming beg. I killed them anyway.
---
If they hadn't have done that and ran onto the boat I would have killed them too.
---
Sometimes the ?? is just gonna kill you. Such is life on a pvp server.
---
Is casting time same as normal mount?
---
This game literally has the nicest/easy going community. Dont play lol or cod.
---
45 lock here. Should I drop alchemy for enchanting? I'm already artisan, but damn, it's very difficult to earn much money in alchemy at the moment. Getting free health pots has only been the real benefit.
---
You can turn off the filter in the settings
---
Exactly, running around as a twink 19 in WSG you feel like an elite compared to the people who queue while they are leveling. I mean an actual in game Elite. The other team either has to coordinate to deal with you, or send their own twinks. It's not just 'you deal a little more damage, why bother', you're on a whole different level and it feels like you've been rewarded for taking the time to do it.
---
Download Atlas Loot. It has a list of dungeons in a drop down list, and lists each boss + the loot they can drop.
---
There are still people hitting 60 for the first time daily due to things that are in fact not their own fault.
---
Id actually argue the people who are “ done “ with phase 1 are in such a position due to their own fault. I have no sympathy for the people who raced through the game and are waiting now.
---
Why? Do spriests beat warlocks?
---
Shouldn't be surprising that those complaining about classic are also bad at it.
---
They want the same gear in raid, which you say they'll never get, which may be true, and that they are the only other class that fuck s with warlocks in pvp
---
Say a mage has frostbolts that hit for 1k, on the high end unless you're using AP or ToEP. That's 400 dps. Talents (+6) and gear (+1) to 90% hit makes it 360. Assume the talent to double frost crit bonus (to 100%). If they already have 25% crit (5% base, 10% winter's chill, 10% from gear or ony buff), their current DPS would be 360*1.25 = 450; with the extra 3% from the aura it'd be 360*1.28 = 460.8 for a difference of 10.8 dps. 
---
What a lot of people don't understand is that spell crit doesn't scale super well. Better than spellpower, which doesn't scale at all, but it's significantly less than +1% damage from 1% crit.
---
The aura is more useful on mobs in a dungeon and bosses &lt;63, where your base crit is probably lower, your hit is way higher, and your dps is higher because you're using more than just frostbolt.
---
Why don’t you just go level in dungeons? That’s what you should be doing anyway getting the BiS gear from 52-60. Are you on skeram?
---
People are saying that shareholders wants lead to these shitty game designs. What kind of simpleton do you have to be to think they are sitting down at the design board with the devs? nobody is saying that and it should be obvious. Maybe work on your own comprehension.
---
This, among others, is one of the reasons tanks burn out.
---
Once ZG comes out, get that spell hit cap!! Also enjoy actually being solid dps in 5 mans and surprising people. It is fun!
---
Is their a way to tell what your rank is throughout the week? Or do you just have to keep playing and hope you got enough honor that week.
---
I'm sure when the mage pulled he ice blocked and forced all agro to the next closest being the healer.
---
Yeah, hence why I'm gonna test the /target thing tonight.
---
I'd be really surprised if /target didn't work to be honest since the client more or less treats it like your character is at the viewing point (hence why they let the bug slip through once upon a time where we could nuke people from where we were farsighted/sentry totemed to).
---
Hunters benefit from kiting casters to keep them out deadzone and to let viper tick while mitigating incoming damage. Warlocks or spriests will often want to kite other casters and let DoTs tick. Elemental shamans are often kited to get them out of their totem forest and/or run out of range of their spellcasts.
---
I'd have to agree. I quit right when 3.2 hit
---
To help optimize cooldowns - IE to using a 30s Death Wish 10-15 secs too late or too early.
---
Barage girdle
---
what would you say about faerlina?
---
My argument is other classes are 100%.
---
Druids are 70% + 70% + 70% + 70%.  DPS, stealth, healing, tanking, innervate, multiple CC spells.
---
Nice gatekeeping mate.
---
I'm pretty sure most twinks enjoy fighting other twinks (and not just ruining the day of randos). Twinking is a way to have a max geared char without what's "max gear" continually changing and while also having it not take forever to hit that max level of gearing.

I'm hoping they'll add in the exp lock (that they did in wrath?) and give twinks their own bracket. Then every complaint you have about twinks ruining low level pvp doesn't really exist. Of course people can still leave the lock off and try to ruin BGs, but at least we can know which twinks are doing it to be dicks.
---
That shield is great but be aware of you take it you can't take the blue lightsaber sword from the same quest.
---
Personally I took the sword.
---
From what I noticed in LFG on my server last weekend, most people are still looking for BRD and ZF. People who powered through the content at the start and began raiding from the get go may be tired of it, but the majority of players casually playing throughout the week are still almost to 60 or just getting there and picking up MC and Ony.
---
As a disclaimer, I'm not saying power through as if no-life-ing to get to 60, I mean those that stayed ahead of the pack.
---
Image being that political.. Like.. What the fuck
---
They won't. I tried.

Pretty brave to post this on Reddit here where no one is sensitive to emotions. I understand this but (I hate saying this) that’s the Internet man. Plus, it’s just a video game. Definitely take a break from WoW and play a single player game.
---
Being a player is good enough for a need roll on any item with a 150g sale price.
---
Do you mean people who worked for there gold and don't feel like handing it out to someone that put zero effort in before begging? Yeah such scumbags.....
---
I never directly give them money,  i trade them vendor trash.
---
I went to brd at 52, having finished hinterlands and ungoro. Figured im taking a bit more damage than id like as arms, and respecced prot. Just gonna spam dungeons for prebis till 60.
---
Questing as prot sucks, and i would recommend respeccing to prot after you consider yourself to be "done with questing"
---
Hell yeah!
---
Do people die doing the cannonball leap method?
---
People don't interrupt period. I don't pug anymore unless I'm really bored but any time I do I have to walk up and kick the cast just to get the mob to the tank while the mage stands there spamming frostbolt or whatever.
---
Even my guild is pretty bad about it. I had 5/6 of our total interrupts on sulfuron last week.
---
Still won't help us with stuns though sadly. 
---
Rogue's trinket is only for charm, fear and poly.
---
Any other pallies trying to bring back sit spam reckoning? I've had ok success with the /sit /startattack /stopattack /sit macro, but far more success timing sits for the end of a swing timer and moving right during the swing. 
---
Anybody else playing with this? Thoughts?
---
Its somewhere between 10-20% inferior. Which I would say is significant.
---
If you have discord or any other way to talk via voice chat and don’t think it’s weird, I’d be willing to have a chat and answer any questions you have, but it’s too much for me to type
---
Ironfoe is Epic
---
If you think humans are being shit irl you should really stay off the internet.
---
Idk out of 2 guild farm runs probably 5h we’ve gotten 7.
---
Just level mining and do 2 or 3 man DME jump runs. Split thorium or if you’re lucky and you’re the only miner, don’t split them lol. Usually about ~70g per hour for me. Then I just buy my Dark Runes (or do 1-2 Scholo runs) and farm the Icecap for my Major Mana potions (I’m herbalism and get the Dreamfoil from the DME runs)
---
&gt; Tanking however I'd like to lead the group and mark mobs.
---
Just don't bother on your first couple runs
---
Same reason i'll never give someone 'the last 10g they need for their mount at 40'. Only gonna create more problems down the line. If you can't be bothered to earn 100g for your mount without begging then you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Enchanting makes like no money on my server. Once you get max herb and alc and are lvl 60 it can be pretty good money I belive. Idk how many major mana pots locks use. But those things sell for shut loads on the ah.
---
Yeah it doesn't have to be a stealth specific add-on. Just any add-on that's causing conflicts. Usually if console reload is fixing it then it's an add-on issue.
---
Makes sense, considering dwarves can't even be mages.
---
*WHOOSHHH*
---
Does it speed up your crafting time also?? That’s awesome.
---
You realize better guilds are at the point where melee ignore mechanics on Shazzrah and Golemagg, and get fear wards for Magmadar (who only has time to fear once anyway). Your melee should have 100% uptime on all those fights, and with 100% uptime the melee (combat/fury) will beat a hunter no problem.
---
Can't interrupt the Crypt Fiends, but Banshees and Gargoyles it works wonders for.
---
My friend hit me with the "man, I just *raped* this priest!" c. 2005. We still don't let him live it down
---
Actually they have shown at 305 weapon skill you only need a \*total\* of 6% hit (not an additional).
---
This is due to gaining 2% hit and also the skill removing the 1% penalty so in effect gaining 3% hit.
---
So with spec (5%), you only need 1% from gear to be capped for specials.
---
The enchant, you used to be able to use the enchant to proc off procs.
---
Will bwl bosses die in 30 seconds too?
---
Wondering the same.
---
*You have bested me*
---
Honestly I have the same problem but instead of just taking the abuse I end up dishing back it up at them and I frankly don't like being that guy.
---
Most of my problems stemmed from simply not ignoring the douche and reading their hate until I gave a reaction.
---
Once I started trusting my gut and ignoring the douches before they even started spewing their crap, I've had a much more enjoyable time.
---
Some may call me sensitive, or a sissy. But why on earth should I eat some elses verbal bullshit?
---
If I ever convert my Ele shaman to Ele-Enh frost spec (for raid / pve dps) I would love nothing more than a pair of these.
---
This post should rightfully make a lot of people envious.
---
I don't mind ones that follow you. The railroad ones are terrible, especially if they are long (Ratchet high elf for horde...)
---
i use the version 5.7.148
---
reinstalling the addon is the only thing i can still think of
---
sorry
---
On a shaman, what a waste. Gz tho, where u the only one needing it when it dropped?
---
Mages have to decurse in like 4 fights.
---
water or lava lol
---
No way it ever sells for more than 30-60 days transmute profit
---
This might be the new worst UI
---
I got Briarwood Reed my first UBRS run lol.  Two questions though:
---
1. Does using the Egg Freezer item for the quest spawn any whelps?  Or is it safe to do without group being ready for it?
---
2. Does Finkle Einhorn spawn every time someone skins the beast, or just sometimes?  I forgot to pick up his quest because I didn't notice him the first time.
---
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy isn’t for everybody.
---
Ahh, yes. The glorious PowerPoint Presentation of Doom. 
---
Long time since I heard it’s siren song
---
Some context: there's a chest on the shore of Swamp of Sorrows.  Two Murlocs spawned on elevated platforms that they cannot get out of.  The chest spawned in between them.  If you try to get near the chest, you'll be put in combat, but the two Murlocs are stuck in "Evade" mode.  You can't kill the Murlocs, and can't open the chest.  It will be there FOREVER.
---
Quick update, found the root of the problem....
---
It was my keypad, somethings fucked up with it and when I was pressing buttons it was making my pc flip out. That's it.
---
After countless hours of scratching my head, uninstalls and reinstalls, fresh windows install, cursing my pc etc etc, it all boiled down to a faulty keypad! Which is why for honor didn't affect me (played with xbone controller, no use of the keypad)
---
Im on ashbringer
---
If have no concerns of keeping aggro on all the mobs then sure
---
The online community seems a lot more Asshole-ish than it did 15 years ago. People that have stayed playing MMOs over the last 15 years are used to it, these attitudes are considered 'normal' now.
---
For those that have been absent from MMOs, the change is notably significant (imo). I feel this is due both to me getting older and the average game player age being a lot younger (than I am). You just don't have time for baby shit selfish attitudes anymore, so they're behaviour stands out a lot more to you.
---
1) You’re making a lot of assumptions off things I didn’t say or even insinuate.
---
2) Poor != in poverty. Poverty is being extremely poor, destitute. If you are in poverty, you should be working (this doesn’t mean physically) to get out, not comparing your characters aesthetics to the aesthetics of someone else’s pretty pixels. That’s a distinct failure in priorities.
---
If your priorities are that fucked, or you’ve given up on attempts to better your position (which sounds like your case), you lose any sort of empathy from me. I’ve been poor, I no longer am. But I don’t now or did I ever try to embellish my situation and try to insinuate I was in poverty for sympathy, which your posts carry the tone.
---
Interesting.
---
I'll have to poke around to see if its something odd, as many others are reporting similar issues.
---
I might have to test common addons like Questie or Atlas to see if there is something going on there.
---
if you needed this over any other class that can use it then shame on you
---
Spoken like someone who never gets invited to bachelor parties of any kind at all
---
Your talking about raiding 
---
I'm not
---
Where are the maps? I found the dungeon guides and it has a walkthrough by text, but I don't see any maps.
---
Needs more "f-f-f-fuck"
---
also
---
&gt;FUCK!  
---
ASS!
---
Shammy got felstriker over a bunch of rogues in UBRS on my server.
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
We have a great guild name set up for Pagle NA is you are hunting when Phase 3 drops
---
Except in once case you are grieving your team, and in the other you are grieving the enemy team.  
---
Do you really not see a difference there?
---
Yikes :s big F
---
But it's a respectful big middle finger.
---
Mage is far better
---
I have no interested in taking anyone who isn't 60 through stratholme, scholo, UBRS, or DM: North or West. You can find plenty of groups for dungeons you aren't at an extreme disadvantage in. Your gunna ass pull trash, do less damage and there's plenty of 60s who want to come.
---
We dont need to be spreading this information :)
---
that is indeed the trick i was referring to in my post
---
I do this as well I make sure to ask if it’s an alt or not but when I was lvling up tailoring I had way to many 10 slot bags left over so now they are gifts to new people trying to lvl on the server.
---
I see a really enthusiastic player asking you for gold. I don’t see the desperation here to call it begging.
---
However there wasn’t an amount specified. If you felt like being a champ could least hand the brother 5g.
---
I haven’t played retail since WotLK but this “retail/classic” class discrimination got to stop.
---
See it from the guys point, he was so excited to play he ran all the way to Org to get some help.
---
And seriously bro, WHAT THE FUCK do you mean “classic experience”? You slaved yourself off so others have to? People that pay their own sub can play how they want.
---
Brother, you is a stuck up prick. You don’t have to give the gold, all good but the attitude I see here... wow...
---
Then you come to reddit and show us this stupidity.
---
You don’t need to me empathetic, this person is not suffering, but wow that’s such a dickhead convo I see here on your part.
---
I really do wish you the best in your WoW experience, but you need to adjust your approach when it comes to  other players.
---
Just mane felcloth hood or dream weave. Legs off the beast will work fine too.
---
You should try playing the super casual snowflake of a game called Final Fantasy 14
---
o.o
---
Lol I thought this might be the response! 
---
Only because mine are so basic y’all don’t need me to share!
---
With the gear you have, how well you do statistically against others who have similar gear. Basically it tells you how good you are irrelevant of gear. So if you parse really well with bad gear, if you have good gear. You will be at top of meter
---
He was being kind, he didn't feel like being a dick. He should've been a dick.
---
Use VW and aoe taunt the bug packs. Start hellfire and sac void as soon as he loses aggro. Dead. Bring a couple limited invuln pots for fuckups.
---
Took me about 15 tries to get these babies
---
I bet you can find some people to duel in IF trade chat.
---
This is why I'm glad no one on this sub has any control over any aspect of Classic.
---
Yea bait out the shield and cc him until it expires, really your only hope.
---
Also restorative potion is a lifesaver
---
Shame.
---
Of the Monkey gloves, bracers and ring are bis for hunters and rogues. Guy below is right, fang leggings are best legs
---
Depends on if you want to keep killing mobs to skin them to make the skinning worthwhile. Overall I would say that there is more money in mining, however.
---
Dayum, someone is a salty druid
---
Sarcasm? haha
---
Might pick up 300 tailoring if you havnt. Grind felcloth and sell the bags.
---
Maybe you are just using an obvious path after vanishing.  I mean you walk slower in stealth so it's easy for them to catch up and see you if after vanishing you use the most obvious pathing.
---
I don't know if you have ever played League of Legend but Shaco (a sneaky clown) can turn 100% invisible and at first I kept getting caught and was wondering if people were hacking since they seem to know where I was. Up until I realised  that I kept using the most obvious path after stealthing.  People aren't stupid NPC player that once you vanish will stop walking and be like "omg where did he go" he'll try to anticipate what you are going to do : "If i was  a sneaky rogue where would I be right now" and just outrun you and see you
---
At least this guy was nice for the whole conversation. My last begger said that he will suck me for couple of gold. For those who interested, I just ignored him.
---
Impale/Prot (17/3/31) Gnome Warrior here.  In near pre BIS.
---
I enjoy prot quite a bit, but I am curious how others felt switching to fury/prot. What gear point makes it worthwhile (even1h/sh) fury?
---
Also does anyone get a muggers belt and go daggers for that sweet 305 weapon skill?
---
This is why I hate all the advice telling new players not to buy all their skills. There are some skills that offer very little benefit when upgraded (like warrior skills that go from weapon damage+15 to weapon damage+18), but you should at the very least learn the first level of each skill
---
First a pally to about 44 because I wanted to try alliance, then I made a rogue and haven’t looked back since.
---
The thing is, this doesn't break the game. I'm sure they've had thousands of reports of this issue, but it's just not a high priority, or maybe it's so difficult to fix that they're just not going to.
---
There are tons of bugs in the game and this one is cosmetic. There are probably hundreds more issues that break things for various classes or quests or whatever, and those will likely get fixed first. 
---
Just try not to let it bother you, and know that you'll be done in the plaguelands eventually =)
---
In centuries since the founding of Dalaran I don't think they were keeping out gnomes with aptitude.
---
How much will Phase 2 Honor system affect the game?
---
This is my first time playing WoW and I’ve been a pacifist up to my current level, 50. I’ve had a lot of peaceful encounters and I’m wondering if phase 2 will turn Azeroth into a bloodbath.
---
Hunters with perception.  Just what the game didn't need.
---
Personally, I would avoid enchanting at this point in the game. Making money from it is more trouble than it's worth.
---
Mage is literally just spamming frostbolt, very rarely in the open world unless AOE farming do mages use anything other than frostbolt and MAYBE frost nova if a mob gets close enough
---
it's happened to me and i use stealth just as the good lord blizzard intended
---
&gt;&gt;Just because you see results doesn't mean they correspond with reality.
---
that's exactly what he said. 
---
He said that the data are out there, but that no dataset is complete. He's just arguing that the guy who said "people are just making up numbers" is wrong. People are referencing available, although incomplete, data sets.
---
Yeah.  You can.
---
I always saw a purple wispy cloud with a star shining through it. Much like you’d see in netherstorm. The star like shine, I thought, was the Mage passing through the cloud with the ‘blink’ spell, similar to how the spell effect is in the game
---
Yeah, you just need to be within viewing distance of a party/raid member when they get an honor kill.
---
Shamans can tank when paladins get a ranged DPS spec.
---
His first dungeon was Deadmines. Odds are he's a human rogue.
---
Do these buff stack with others? Like does the +Intel one stack with mage buff?
---
I see ppl throwing around “RMT,” what does that stand for?
---
Hinterlands also will give the 1% hit trinket as well, and theres a TON of XP in those elite quests.
---
LIES!!! I love boomkin DPS. I will take one boomkin over any other role.
---
They have the single most entertaining dance in the game. Every raid needs a boomkin mascot to dance and provide their 3% spell crit. How are you supposed to properly celebrate downing a boss without a boomkin dancing on or around its corpse!?!
---
He either did a rend run or was a shitty off tank. You can easily get through rend with a decently geared 58 tank. Drakkisath would shit down a 58 tanks throat tho. Poorly geared 60 tanks with average healers get destroyed...
---
Only playing against bad shadow priests then
---
I just got into a decent guild and never pugged again (majority of times).
---
I’m not leveling another character with the same BIS list as a warrior. Also I’m not a streamer. A guildie isn’t gonna power lvl me for 30 lvls. Time is money, 15$ is worth less to me than spending 30 hours power leveling somebody else. If I create another account power lvl a mage , I can use that mage to power level all the alts I could dream of on my main account
---
I believe it, but it goes both ways - they have a much lower floor, too. It's made me hate partying with resto shaman.
---
yes
---
Lol sounds so tough...
---
You... are the... mafia.
---
I keep trying to decide between mage and rogue actually, which is why I asked. What do you like about rogue that much more than mage? Considering mages have so much qol, I mean.
---
it absolutely is
---
My first run in a dungeon, I looted a chest without realising that the roll I saw on chat is for that one. Lol.
---
dang I ran Deadmines a few times and never saw Cruel Barb drop lucky lucky!
---
Seems balanced.  
---
I loved prot pally in MoP with vengeance, especially solo-tanking Garrosh. You could be top damage and top healing as a prot paladin tank. It was amazing and not OP at all. /s
---
It's objectively not.
---
Who's bright idea was it to give ranged DPS the ability to pretend-die instead of actually dying when they make a huge mistake and wipe the party?
---
You seem like you're having a blast playing this game.
---
I was just saying that's why I was confusing the 2
---
heheh, it must be that sharper sound that plays from certain ones. I think(but not 100% sure) that the shadow wands sound OK, but the arcane ones are particularly bad for some people.
---
On my ele shaman I have a macro that turns on my auto attack whenever I use earth shock or frost shock
---
#show tooltip
---
/target seletec [nodead, etc....]
---
/dismount
---
/cancel aura shapeshift
---
/cast frost shock
---
/start autoattack
---
Something along that nature.  Also the order matters so that it only dismounts you when you have a valid target in range.  That macro isn't 1:1 what you would paste in the macro since im at work, but that's pretty close to what I have on purge, LB, CL, ES, FS.
---
Since casting a spell does not start auto attack I can only imagine how mandatory this type of setup would be for a shaman.
---
If they're that level and you don't have the items yet, I got some bad news for you.
---
That's cause Resto Druid Rank 3 Healing Touch is one of the most mana efficient heal in the game, perfect for spamming on the tank.
---
Avoid fighting Warlocks in general. In world PvP you can get an ambush and win. If it´s a duel where everyone has everything ready, you won´t beat a Warlock. If he is a Soul Link spec, you will never win. Only maybe with a Free Action Potion, you can do something but most likely you will die anyway. 
---
I played Warlock a lot on private servers and I have to say they are literally broken when it comes to PvP. They have a void shield that absorbs over 2k damage, then another one immediately. They have 30% damage reduction, healthstone, and death coil. If you want to kill a Soul Link Warlock that has semi-decent EQ, you will have to be able to deal at least 12k dmg to him while he only needs to deal like 4k dmg. Which he can do simply by putting 3 dots on you. 
---
There were a couple of duel tournaments of pro-players and best vanilla players (you can watch them on youtube) and each and every one of them was won by a warlock. AND Soul Link spec was banned from the tournament so they could only play an affli. 
---
Some say that Shadow Priest is a hard counter to Warlocks, while I think that Warlocks are hard counters to Shadow Priests. You have a purge on your felhunter, high resistances from talents and gear, which makes you resist 1/4 of their spells, you can silence their casts, you have a shadow ward, spellstone that absorbs over 1300 magic damage, 30% damage reduction, mana drain and better fear. He can´t do anything against that. You can absorb so much damage that he will drain his mana faster than he drains your health. I fought many Spriest and there is nothing they can do. Put dots, purge, mana drain. After 20 seconds, he has to wand you. That can´t be done when you are sitting on 80% hp and full mana and he is 30%hp and 0% mana. 
---
The only thing that killed me was a properly geared warrior that popped a Free Action Potion. No mage, no rogue, no priest, no shaman, no one. Sadly that is the state of PvP balance in Classic but it wasn´t the main focus of the game back then so I can´t blame the developers
---
Calm down get some sunlight mate
---
I wore the gnomer pants until 57 and bought devilsaur
---
dont sweat it
---
While warriors are rogues are definitely better than hunters atm, hunters are still probably third on the charts and I can see how a hunter would beat everyone else in a semi-casual guild if they were geared and pulling around 600-650 dps.
---
This is some dumbass shit.  If they have it still set to group loot id just need on it and tell em to get fucked.
---
That sounds fun?
---
This doesn't happen after lvl 20
---
I sold a Krol Blade and had to wade through a lot of bullshit to finally get a sale. Lots of scammers; tells from people you're asking too much, people saying that you gotta lower it and sell it quick, guy whos in thunderbluff but needs it CoD'd (DONT COD EXPENSIVE/RARE STUFF) because he can't make it to Org, etc. I ended up undercutting the AH price and ate the 5% tax, it wasn't worth trying to sneak out another 25-40g.
---
The lack of dual wielding threw me off
---
I had invited someone to a party for Sunken Temple, and he asked me for 10g to respec. He would probably have earned that while running the instance.
---
Are there priests that don't put 5pts in spirit tap?
---
it will be months until he has it if hes not prio in his raid. He was just nice to you.
---
I hadn't heard of any server having a preponderance of Alliance.
---
Here on Incendius we also use trade and general, so you just make a regular tab with everything and remove loot and skillup messages.
---
Are any new servers going to be opened?
---
I was in shock when I saw him drinking a dew off the bat
---
You are not remembering correctly
---
What should I do as far as enchants on my gear for aoe farming?
---
Thats not true. Weapon procs scale with it.
---
Probably leveling by lasher farming.
---
Yeah, it's so nice not feeling any need to be top tier anything - I've done it already, and it wasn't worth the effort then, so it definitely isn't worth it now.
---
Helps me keep it all in check, because there's no question that this game was an addiction to me years ago.
---
I'm not even 60 yet, just taking time to enjoy it all. Like you said, there's a lot to appreciate about this game, even now.
---
Anathema is literal trash while Benediction is god tier.
---
That’s a really good idea ty
---
people are free to enjoy the game any way they want
---
Never, go arms ideally or fury if you plan to raid MC in the near future
---
Hmm. Does that mean that Undead warlock would be better than Orc due to having WotF as an extra CD against other warlocks?
---
Or is the orc stun resist just too good overall do you think?
---
When they started removing layers queues increased thou so most likely they changed their mind in panic and used layers to increase population
---
I tanked a BRD run earlier where every time I actually marked a skull it died last or simultaneously with the last mob. People are fucking stupid, and on top of that they're douchebags.
---
Demon armor life regen is nothing compared to reg from food/water. Locks should tap to even mana and eat+drink or tap to low and bandage to reg as fast as possible. If you don't have mage water and want to save gold you can just drink or eat, it's slow though and if you are the only one drinking you are wasting the group's time. Warlocks don't have gold worries at any point in the game because of cheap mounts and good ways to farm at 60 so it's not a big deal to spend a little on water, food and bandages.
---
When I use blind and nobody breaks it I'm so happy. Most of the time someone immediately attacks it even in a bad pull where there are 4 other things running around trying to murder us.
---
Any chance Eye of Shadow price goes down in p2 with the release of Lord Kazzak? It's about 350g on my server atm
---
TLDR; In people realizing tanks can really make use of buffs (IE: Battle Shout) for threat, people realized Rightous Fury, despite the tooltip, actually affects all Holy Spells. Not just attacks like the tooltip, which Blizzard confirmed as functioning correctly. 
---
Combine that affecting Blessing of Kings (Which has the highest base threat) and the fact that Greater Blessings uniquely affect the entire class, rather than are limited to a group. 
---
In turn, if you have 6+ of a class you can, for 150 mana, cast a spell that generates more threat to everything in combat than a Warrior can generate with their highest threat-generating Single Target ability, let alone AoE.
---
what a strange thing to retaliate with lol
---
When you find every complaint about raiding and loot on Reddit being a result of a 'Loot Council'... well that tells you all you need to know about this poor system. Just put a value on tasks and people have the choice to invest their time to earning the DKP. If they spend the time to earn, they get first or second pick usually because they have the highest DKP. 
---
Very simple reward system to reward effort and contribution. Doesn't need any power tripping groups opinion and one sided 'i like this guy more' that just makes the other players feel shafted. LC's encourages nepotism significantly
---
He asked for one single gold. You see it in the first message.
---
Exactly! If it makes you chuckle it’s good to have. I don’t understand who thought a wow subreddit couldn’t have memes...
---
Keep on kickin', brother!
---
Warlocks straight up orc. Guldan makes the warlocks.
---
Thank you, yes the threat with rockbiter would be too much.
---
As for ravager with windfury its kind of wierd as it sometimes stores your windfury proccs during the beyblade, I had a lot of double windfury proccs the moment the spinning "naturally" stopped pretty much oneshotting the mob. 
---
But like I said its a wierd interaction, because if you get a ravager procc while spinning this doesnt seem really work.
---
Shame
---
Impale Prot is a bad build. 
---
There is no objective 'gear point' that makes it worth switching, but I'd recommend at least having full blues, most of if not all your pre-BiS and hitting the yellow hit cap.
---
If you're not human/orc, going daggers is not a bad idea if you can get one of the +daggers items (preferably the gloves from molten core)
---
We don't know. Likely they will still offer transfer to the "medium" ones as with time it will be falling down anyway. FRESH likely won't happen until like 2021 assuming 2020 Blizzcon will show what's the future of Classic and Classic TBC/WoTLK etc.
---
Not true. My current Id is about 6 hours old and I am making bank. Every 30min mobs respawn tho.
---
Please start with mara. I've jumped in DM E after watching a couple of videos as sm/ruin and I got frustrated after corpse running for hours not killing a single satyr (let alone boss). It's not that easy in my experience. Mara is more forgiving because you don't aggro any trash unless you'd stand right on top of it. Having herbalism and/or mining makes both Mara and DM E better for gold.
---
You should compare Arcane Crystals to BL, and I know that I'd much rather farm BL solo right now.
---
Do you make your own groups?  Try it, you'll find nothing is reserved.
---
just go in and heal the dungeon first time you do it, or just let people know that you might need some directions if you're tanking. People are grateful to have any tank, so they'll give you some slack in that respect.
---
I spam tanked dungeons from 20-60, and each new one was a refresher for me, but I didn't have any issues taking charge and leading after a run or two.
---
Yes. Many pallies are already doing this in the manner you describe and other ways to cheese spell batching.
---
Hoping you're trolling here. What kind of new player skips the starting zone completely to go to the major city to beg? How enthusiastic about the game can they really be?
---
One of my guild's Resto shaman has one. I tanked the run but I'm an Orc that already has a Deathbringer so I'd never really use it. He won the roll.
---
People get SO salty when they see it.
---
The social aspect is what made WoW so popular. The modern bland version w/ no social interaction is far, FAR worse. 
---
My suggestion is try to find likeminded people. Theyre out there. And grow a thicker skin. That's just life. It wont ever change. And shielding yourself from it costs you far too much in other areas.
---
55-58 is when i started to have threat issues as arms.
---
Bad idea if you want to stay competitive in PvP.  Unless you plan on getting at least rank 10, in which case you'll probably be ok until AQ40.
---
The weapons are far better than the best t2 weapons. If you get rank 14 you will be using those weapons when you kill KT in Naxx.
---
Yep-- they're a very accessible class. Swing weapons, shock things sometimes, heal. But there's so much more available if people pay attention to what their skills *can do*.
---
User interface.
---
Wait really? If I see a cast bar I feel obligated.
---
DM was supposed to demolish the economy, yet the effect is only a fraction of what it was claimed it will be. First days people may rush but then it will cool down. People will return to raiding, gold making, farming. Some organized HK farming will persist but hard to tell what the meta will be for actually consistent farm if any.
---
People did world firsts while choosing to eschew mark of the wild?
---
You got the with mats in the bags, you learn, start spamming an enchant, learn more and repeat.
---
Honestly just as youre about to raid, arms is way better for open world content and dungeons.
---
But you can do whatever you want to in this game. So up to you really
---
I've been 60 for weeks and got my first two beggars in the past few days. I just didn't respond.
---
I don't see it that often, usually only strath with first orb for tank or a dm group where furors book is for tank.
---
I didn't even make it to 60 honestly. The pve aspect of the game is painfully boring. I can deal with easy content no problem but when the core gameplay of my class is boiled down to press one or two keys on repeat i'm just done.
---
They rushed phase II.  They will be rushing other phases.  I was hoping Classic would last YEARS before TBC.
---
Skin of shadow.  A royal pain the ass to accumulate four of them. Save them for ZG patch or burn them now?
---
Do you have 5 points in spirit tap?
---
It is if your main focus is pvp. If your main focus is pve, though, then you are right.
---
Go away
---
40k, gold is nothing retail either which is also sad I believe there’s a 5 million gold mount.
---
Mind soothe only works on humanoids though :D.
---
Well Heartseeker is it my friend. It was a transfer server at first. No one went to it really for the most part when only Stalagg could go, apart from a few alliance. So it remained low pop, and it was actually peaceful and we had a 60/40 split pop which was not bad at all. In fact I enjoyed it because I went there hoping for balanced pvp. It's partly why I left stalagg as horde.
---
Well after the third transfers opened, an influx of alliance poured in as 10 realms could come. So every alliance member sick of being zerged down left to come here, and no horde came. So all the alliance poured in... to do the same here that as done to them lol. 
---
Thus the population changed. And as horde can't level here they're rerolling elsewhere. This is why we have the 80/20 split as seen today. 
---
I know the numbers are absurd, but myself and a few others have been keeping count ever since the census got busted awhile back. I have two accounts and I'm always checking things out. It's disgustingly overpopulated by alliance
---
Thanks mate
---
Oh I grouped with that guy earlier. Same dude who tried to say he was doubling my dps on the meter (which, 1), I was tanking and 2) no he wasn't, he was about 120% of my dps). I honestly don't even care if DPS pull aggro as long as they don't dump it on the healer, and as long as the healer doesn't go OOM trying to heal them. Let them suffer and die for their metasexual meter humping.
---
So you would join under the assumption an item is reserved then ninja it? And they are the ones pulling dumbass shit by announcing their intentions for the run at the beginning?
---
My best advice would be to just try random things you hear about/see online. Pick one or two things to try a day and go do it. Over time you will have a good idea about what methods are good or not and also when they are good. It's usually good to have multiple sources of potential revenue available to your character in case for whatever reason one or more of your current ones are unavailable. Not to mention it's more fun (generally) to play this way anyways.
---
Stun locked a Rogue to death as a Sub Rogue with Imp Backstab the other day. People just don't understand...
---
So ignoring utility a boomy needs to do within ~40 dps of the other group casters to justify their position? Can boomies pull that off?
---
I still have no idea what they did to the gear. It’s just stats now? Also the story seems like a huge jumbled mess.
---
Gearing tanks first is the best way to progress your raid as a whole.
---
Bruh getting bags starting out makes a huge difference, and would give someone I thought was a newbie 1g no problem (or maybe directly giving them a few bags). That being said, I'd probably ignore someone who was whispering me begging for money because that fuck probably already got gold from a few other people.
---
Starting with bags could be the difference between a new player deciding it's not their cup of tea or keeping with it. Way to gatekeep what trying classic is. I like do do RFC runs on alts and then give people who are noobs (as in literally new beginners) bags/wands to help them start their leveling process.
---
It feels great seeing the 13 minute gap between his last two replies. 
---
I take my hat off to you, OP.
---
So mandatory as enh shaman! Thanks a lot for sharing!
---
I always give out underwater breathing buffs on boats just in case we sink
---
Threat is a non issue in raids, regrowth is only used as a last ditch, and tranquility is situational though sometimes useful,also you wont take much damage in raids so pushback is not necessary. Swiftmend and imp rejuv are the main benefits of going deep resto the other points are better used elsewhere.
---
This is is why tbc ain't the right move forward.
---
Weak to frost? No such thing. Locks are weaker than mages in early raids because their talents are a bit lacking and they don't get enough hit and crit to get the crazy scaling going. You should still not be doing a third of a mage's damage, especially because some locks can get a corruption slot to add a little bit of excitement and damage. 
---
In dungeons you can go ham with dots as much as you want (or rather as the aggro allows), it's your own fault if you spam shadow bolt.
---
Appreciate the fact that you’re horde and that Orc warriors don’t want dalrends or they shouldn’t any want
---
What level?
---
i still see a one eyed blob monster
---
Get all pvp enchants for your pvp equipment. Might possibly increase in price
---
That's the problem they're all waiting to zero out on a mage blade or bone reaver and not picking up all the other items that are upgrades.
---
If you know where like Rich Thorium Veins spawn you can run with herb detector and swap to mining when next to those.
---
I started my mage with skinning/mining and then dropped skinning for tailoring and now dropped mining for herbalism. Skinning early with devilsaurs + 1 pristine hide and dropped when it was collapsing. Thorium was selling well but not so long ago prices decreased like 4x so after stashing arcane crystals for personal use I dropped it for herbalism (having 300 alchemy alt also, making various pots and selling on AH).
---
Congrats!  That's some crazy luck!
---
I had two Krol blades drop for me in the same day on my Rogue but I lost rolls on both. :(
---
Idk if opening a ticket helped or not but it got resolved about an hour after I did. So in total it took about 4 hours for it to go through
---
This :) Few hundred gold in leftover quests.
---
Canute?
---
The above post was about dungeons though.
---
Raids are the only things to do in the game
---
But then he just pops out of his soulstone. 
---
You always have to kill a lock twice.
---
Tanks don't share gear with anyone at this point, so if you're gearing tanks at the expense of other classes, you're doing it wrong.
---
Because most Druids are awful. And yes, I'm aware that Warlocks are the hardest matchup for Druids in a 1v1 situation. We have to resort to specific trinkets (shadow reflector, PvP trinket) to stand a chance. That's how this whole conversation started...
---
Priests can farm 40-50g/h. But I agree, 400g is a bit much. It costs around 300g on my server and I think that's a pretty decent price for it, all things considered.
---
Go timeworn mace + offhand from strat live instead of warden for pvp
---
Take this down! I just started doing this yesterday!
---
Noob lol
---
Alliance - Kirtonos A hunter was advertising an UBRS run so I joined telling him I was coming to complete the final part of the Ony attunement, so we wait to get the group together, all run there while getting ganked several times, finally all get in and clear up until we kill Rend. Then the hunter says "whelp pugs you're out, thanks for coming" and proceeds to invite his guildmates in place of us. I ask politely to stay telling him I told him I was coming for the Ony attunement but he went ahead and kicked me and another pug out of the group. Ended up missing my guild's Ony raid that night because I didn't have enough time to get another run in.
---
you must be talking to someone else because we were talking about UBRS
---
Because the only shadow priest a raid should bring is actually a 31/0/20 Disc priest. They can still throw shadow weaving up, but now can also do useful things like heal, and ~~give~~ sell their Power Infusion to the highest bidder.
---
Why would you ever use rank 1 corruption?
---
The appeal of twinks isn't twink v scrub. It's twinks v twinks.
---
You sound insufferable
---
Folks get temp banned for this if you agreed to a loot rule set by the leader and then violate that rule.
---
He's 55, you want your entire group to be at least 52 because of how he pretty much ignores the tank and how hard he hits.
---
Dunno but it certainly has gotten me out of all sorts of pickles
---
Double freezing band is 2% freeze chance and 42 FROST damage. In PvP mages use a lot of fire spells, and if you aren't a mage then the frost damage is likely useless. 
---
You are giving up health and mana for only a 2% chance. It's fun when it procs but it isnt worth dropping real stats for a 2% chance, imo.
---
it's trash against anything but rogues and you should shit on rogues without the ring
---
The icon is from WarCraft 3. Where it was to be used by him / his model copies random heroes (but i think Wardens got it in the end).
---
So the icon was specifically created with him in mind
---
Oh awesome! Thanks for the explanation. I never played a paladin in vanilla, and I don't have a PC for classic so I had no idea this was a thing. Pretty interesting "clever use of mechanics." Do you think they'll change (nerf) it at any point in the near future?
---
And I just imagined 10 dwarves entering Moira...
---
In dungeons, spam on ads, consumes almost no mana, less likely to pull aggro because almost no threat
---
&gt; Hunters are always on top in the Shazzrah fight.
---
Obviously they do well on a fight where melee literally don't get to play the game, and casters have to constantly stop casting because of the counterspell.  Hunters don't have to do anything to avoid the mechanics of the fight, every other dps spec does, so they do well.
---
&gt; you still need 12% hit for your mainhand to always hit, and 24% for your offhand to always hit.
---
Where are you getting these numbers?
---
" you are a dark edgy emo lord. Emo lords hate fun. "
---
Thanks just DM me next time
---
I use scroll up to send a pet to attack and scroll down to set it to follow.  That shit makes sense.
---
Pretty much all of the streamer/youtuber mages who are pvpers aren't using freezing bands and they're telling their viewers not to waste gold on them.
---
Venruki, North, OhGee, Ziqo, Xaryu just to mention a few.
---
Is this whitemane?
---
I don’t think that’s a retcon necessarily - a retcon is going back and changing something, but that’s not what they did here
---
In Orcs and Humans all the orcs are running off demon blood so you don’t see any of the Shamans. Saying that orcs were shamans before he demon blood, and can be shamans again after the demon blood isn’t retconning anything it’s just adding more to the lore
---
In my case anyway its easier to control the bridge and is easier to run away when i get 5 people mains on me
---
2 button rotation is boring
---
The only reason why I like it on DH is cause it's a fast pace 2 button rotation
---
 &gt;The first half of Pandaria was the last time we did something normal. The period of "calm before the storm" is important. It brings back the sense of adventuring after climactic endgames.
---
This is what I like about Alliance side questing in BFA. There was a lot of low-stakes, world buillding, and adventurer stories.
---
But yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think for every expansion ever, there are cool cinematic story beats they want to do, and they just fill in the blanks to get to those story beats.
---
Sounds like I hurt your fee fees about all of your whiner friends and your projecting tbh. It's ok, don't cry.
---
Rogue is just a better class overall in classic, that said they are one of the least useful classes in BGs due to long cooldowns.
---
As for leveling speed, if you have plenty of bandages and good weapons on your rogue you will level almost as fast as a hunter.
---
FIRE!!!
---
&gt; he tab targeted the boss on accident
---
Ah, the tab targeting while shooting and accidentally pulling extra mobs, what hunter hasn't made that mistake.
---
Hey. Another comment about your UI...
---
What add-on is that for your nameplates? Class icons and colors shown in a blizzard style. I like that.. what is it?
---
Everyone just wants to be able to do everything
---
Oh, they do.
---
People keep talking about difficulty of farming but most of the best farming spots don't involve killing tough mobs.  It's usually fighting other players over spawns of mobs 15+ levels below you.  Unless you are trying to solo winterspring elites what is giving you so much trouble?
---
Thrashblade or bone slicing axe in my offhand for fury?
---
This is the truth of it. If you want to be a goblin and flip AH stuff you need to dedicate a lot of time for it, put up with a ton of whisper nonsense from people claiming stuff sold for 200g less last week, or you waste a ton of gold on AH deposits, undercutters, and the 5% tax. It’s a pain. 
---
The only solution is time and spending too much time in trade chat. Find the people selling good deals and have the gold to grab them ASAP. Always be posting a few items to move, especially when the AH is overpriced and you can get a good deal. The 5% on big ticket items sucks too much so avoid it. 
---
Source: I bum around in trade chat, flip epics and expensive crafting mats a lot. Make a few hundred a week but it isn’t free money and it takes time and annoyance.
---
Kinda like the shittiest priest goes shadow for shadow weave.
---
I will never be the same.
---
Yeah something is wrong here lol is this guy really running around throwing ruptures up on multiple mobs every pull?
---
Staged text logs aren't funny.
---
I think he just means this is 4x more profitable than mooncloth.
---
Well dwarves were the standard ranged units for the Alliance for 10 years before WoW came out. Woulda been weird to flip that long established dynamic just for WoW
---
Wow all you needed to do was yell "LEEERROOOOOOYYYY......"
---
Same, my biggest source of income is striking a deal with groups that need a tank.  I don’t need gear anymore, so I just ask for all green drops, gold upfront or for all the cloth people get.  Everyone always scoffs at the idea until I’m like “alrighty I’ll find another group” and suddenly the deal isn’t that bad.
---
Even doing that, I’m only making 15-20g an hour, the mages I’m grouped with can make that in 20 minutes doing their crazy AOE farms, so I never understood the issue.
---
Having popped invisibility on my mage more than once, yeahhhhh
---
In Dreams?
---
also they leave when they are done.
---
Pregnancy is weird :o
---
O sweet summer child
---
Uh no you can’t. You’ll die.
---
Even just questing i had ~700g when i dinged 60 on my enhancement shaman. No blue/epic drops either, Just didn't spend money really.
---
Did the US government sanction the dps of boomkin?
---
I honestly think it's the other way around. My experience in vanilla had way more toxic people, assholes, and gankers. There's more insults about not performing the meta now, which are honestly way milder and tame than the toxicity used to be. The community in general seems to be more mature. 
---
It's probably just that as an adult you're noticing the immaturity more now.
---
I hope you sanitize database inputs
---
Embrace the Oomkin! Strength+Intellect+mp5 build
---
Whinging will fix it. Shut up sook
---
I mean, I watched the video and they seemed to be doing just fine as 1h and shield. This is classic not retail: the epeen meter race
---
I live to undercut. Not trying to maximize my profit, I'm trying to make a sale and get rid of my shit, while all the other fuckbois are selling for 1s under the next guy and their posts sit and waste their deposit.
---
You’re assuming that blizzard has the capability of creating stable servers. They don’t.
---
Why does every ally repeat this lie?  Does it help them cope with getting face rolled by horde?
---
Holy shit it’s a 19 Twink Rogue
---
&gt; bolvar was an incredible fighter before, 
---
What are you basing this on? I think the only time we've seen him fight is at the Wrathgate.
---
&gt;he is still the lich king.
---
OK, but what does that actually mean? The only power we've seen him have, is the knowledge that comes with being a Lich King, and the fact he can control the undead. That doesn't make him a god.
---
I don't understand where logic fails. You haven't really pointed to anything in the story that contradicts. It just sounds like you're upset that Lich King lost. 
---
And regardless, what they're doing with the story is way more interesting than the predictable, where Bolvar turns into Arthas 2.0.
---
Do everyone a favor and go be a stick in the mud by yourself.
---
My friends keep telling me that I need macros to play Warlock effectively, especially for PvP, but I'm not really sure how/which ways to set them up
---
1. Yes, from 9% =&gt; 6% vs lvl 63 mobs. Also, it significantly reduces both the chance for your strikes to be glancing blows and the damage penalty from glancing.
---
2. Helm of Wrath for pure mitigation. You should be looking for upgrades.
---
Please scream this louder so all can hear!
---
When a group of people has the exact timer and people spread out at each spawn, its pretty much impossible to compete with them until they move on for the day. Even if there isnt a group, it doesnt get efficient until you find 1 and have multiple hours to pursue after for the next spawns
---
Oh my god! I freaked out when I saw you! Great Twink Cosplay!
---
Priest is basically unkillable in this bracket
---
I would grab the lowest level weapon from a vendor and then fight level \~40 wolves in the hinterlands.
---
The level difference means they can't kill you, and you wont even start killing them until about a skill of 200. 
---
I was able to level my 2H axe skill to 300 in about 30 minutes.
---
Grab a couple scrolls of int, find a mage to buff you. The intellect helps a lot with the last few skill points.
---
Storywise, you can't really write the story as if the player is brand new. You kinda have to assume they've done everything or it feels meaningless.
---
You can mind soothe the first pack in UBRS, run to the door and use /tar Jed.
---
&gt;Combined with concentration aura you will have 0% pushback and be absolutely pumping out dps with Hellfire.
---
Whoa whoa whoa.  So concentration helps with channeled spells?!  OMG no way!  That sounds AMAZING!
---
upvote for boondock saint reference.
---
I read this as estimated flight length, and damn that's a mod I really need.
---
Prot pally?
---
Idk why you wouldnt want a prot pally for dungeons
---
The macro can't detect that the ability successfully interrupted anything. It just broadcasts that kick was used, meaning it is now on cooldown. Using an interrupt that late, especially after someone else did, is certainly bad but it still puts the ability on cooldown.
---
Understandable.  Yeah I'm not too interested in tanking, unless it's just to do a dungeon really quick.  Definitely not my M.O. tho
---
Youd take a tank that cant do any aoe over a tank that can?
---
Interesting
---
If you consider that comedy, sure?  I guess I prefer something that doesn’t feel like a hand grenade of sub-par imagery and parallels.
---
Yes, only downside is it doesn't update your wow
---
Blizzard has already been throwing out bans for account sharing, i'd say this isn't a huge concern.
---
Well that was the last information we had from blizzard. It was expected end of december from their wording.
---
When you realize its in fact a sniper aiming at you in MW
---
It’s not an upgrade. Ironfoe is a downgrade for Enhance since they cannot dual wield.
---
I’m going to keep answering people’s questions until I’ve destroyed WoW and you can’t stop me
---
&gt;Pre-Cata you were just "A member of a world famous adventuring guild" You alone were just a nobody, it was the fact you had 39 other people with you.
---
It was way before Cata. You start dealing with world leaders directly in Vanilla's end game and you become a staple of affairs from TBC onwards.
---
I use a macro similar to this. When dismounting, I have to click it twice to cast my shocks. It works fine coming out of ghostwolf though.
---
When do you decide that course of tongues or even weakness is better than the dps you’d add from CoA or CoS?
---
Literally is used wrong here brotha.
---
This makes me miss wow so much
---
&gt; So ignoring utility a boomy needs to do within ~40 dps of the other group casters to justify their position? 
---
&gt; Can boomies pull that off?
---
With better gear or a better player, sure. But all else equal, no way.
---
Only one way to find out
---
So is a warlocks lol. Except shadowbolt...lol
---
And just to clarify, these are only to 51/52, so you have some extra points to play with. Also, Bane vs Aftermath you might consider flipping if you wanted to play with the daze effect, though dazing isn't really helpful for Hellfire. And, as another poster mentioned, you can sacrifice the imp to get an extra 15% fire damage
---
Calm down mate. Ita a game.
---
Unless they have axe of deep woods or flurry axe, Dal is pre-bis I think.
---
Always played with 100-150 and it is fine. You get used to it. The problem is spikes but if it’s solid latency you won’t suffer much imo.
---
Enh until 40. Then elemental. 53-57 as resto.
---
I've leveled both. You have to use your spells. Warlocks you dont
---
Trump plays classic... Reads like 1 of his tweets.
---
It doesn't happen too often if you wait a good 10 seconds before charging in. Sometimes  you lose your charge because it puts you in combat, but if you hang back it usually doesn't happen. It's just that people are stupid  metasexual spreadsheet fuckers and don't actually understand how to play the game.
---
Wtf
---
you must have never been to Nesingwary's camp on a PvP server.
---
I’ve never seen anything more disgusting in my entire life
---
as a hunter you should be able to manage. i did ungoro on my warrior 50-51 then came back around 53 to finish it off
---
When was nathanos' story written? He was in vanilla but was his background as a famous human ranger written at that time?
---
I mean its literally the best outside of spellpower ring that has a 3% chance to drop and is contested between 20 other ppl per raid????
---
I dunno, I'm enjoying the conversation. Maybe go find something you actually enjoy.
---
This might be a noob question, but why not just levitate?
---
Don’t say “this is all warlocks do” when it’s exactly the same as a mage’s then?
---
Mouse over definitely works for healing.
---
If other classes don't share tank gear, then how are they getting it? Certain items that look like dps gear in disguise should go to the tanks. Like Band of Accuria.
---
We miss you too bro
---
Thank you for the side by side comparison. I was definitely looking for someone who had leveled both to 60, because this alt will be getting there eventually. I know what you are saying about mage mostly being engaging through AoE combat, and I’m not sure that is entirely possible right now due to population, and excess of mages overall.
---
I think trying warlock this time around might be something different , and feel like a new way to level, not to mention all of the pvp to come. Seems like you can really mess around with all of the abilities, and it can get pretty technical, maybe it will actually feel like i am learning something new :) that’s always fun. Thanks for the reply!
---
That's what everyone always thinks
---
Sure it is, whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
No axe weapon skill is &gt; Dal’Rend. It’s pre-bis for humans.
---
They say I'm wrong but I've leveled both. Dot dot wand is all you do.  People throwing In fear? You mean fear the mob into another group of mons pulling aggro and you dieing? There more fun in a mage then a warlock.  All you do as a lock as you level is dot and wand. They act like I personally attacked them.
---
U cant use poison on u MH and benefit from windfury totem buffs?
---
I still think it looks like master roshi.
---
A lot of my UBRS runs seem to think the Father Flame event and Solakar Flamewreath are guaranteed wipes and time-consuming do. They are not, in fact! You kill everything before it even has a chance to do anything threatening.
---
Those look like either shadow unit frames or perl unit frames, but really any unit frames addon should be able to do this. You just need to go into the health and mana bar settings and change the test display to total health and total mana.
---
If I see a mob pull to a healer or another more vulnerable dps I will pull faster than shit as a rogue it should be the secondary mindset for dps that can tank if the need arises
---
Who says “fee fees”? I’m not bothering with any kids
---
We've all done that. If you really want to drive the point home start crafting bandages while they get beat to death.
---
A game that you suck at matey.
---
The basic form is  
---
    /use [@mouseover,exists][fallback 1][fallback 2]... Spell
---
"exists" can be replaced with "help" or "harm", but not their complements "nohelp" and "noharm".
---
can't you see the green parrot with the iron helmet?
---
Ton UI est absolument déguelasse :)
---
small indy company just can't compete with crowdfunded private server hardware.

Un'Goro is recommended as a level 48-55 zone, at 49 you should be fine. I went there at 48 and was able to clear a bunch of quests without too much trouble, though the random Devilsaurs did stomp me a few times.
---
While there may be some higher level quests, you'll still find tons of NPC's in the 48-51 level range which should be yellow to you.
---
We've been so lucky with those. I think we have 4 holy and 1 spriest with eyes now. Just like 1 priest left and we're done.
---
Funny how they went from that to now trolls can be every class except dh and paladin, and there's another troll variety that *can* be paladins.
---
Demoniac dhs when? Let me finish my troll collection.
---
I tend to blind any range mobs the tank can't get into the pack easily and if need be I even vanish sap if I don't add afterwards
---
This is all they do leveling. I've leveled one. At 60 all you do is spam shadowbolt like mages frostbolt. 
---
PvP is more fun on a mage leveling to. Stop acting like it's some personal attack. Warlocks are fast yet boring levelers.
---
Mage should be moving with you incase they grab threat from the polumorph or CS anyway.
---
russian pirate servers perform better than blizzards cheap ass cloud garbage
---
server performance is actually getting WORSE right now on Classic
---
Resto druids are so much better then people give credit. We have a resto druid who constantly is 2nd or 3rd in healing.
---
Shouldn't ever happen. Melee handle it. N/A. Resto pots.  
---
My last time playing classic on a private server I was a mage in a guild that had all the world records for boss kill timers. I just put all my cooldowns, trinkets, and frostbolt into my mousewheel and watched a stream during raids.
---
The whole point of druid IMO is that you have so much utility. You have travel form for +40% speed (and aquatic anywhere near water) whenever you need it even in PVP, you can heal  yourself or others even if you're feral/balance, you can instantly remove roots/snares as any spec, you can go stealth to sneak around even as balance/resto, you can turn into a bear to be fat if you need to, etc. I remember being in PUG's and when things went to shit I could pop heals on my tank/healer that were taking too much heat or battle rez or temporarily tank because the tank got CC'd by something, etc. 
---
=
---
You're right that you're never going to be strictly better at doing X compared to XYZ class (e.g. feral vs a rogue, balance vs a mage), but you will still be able to do more things in general compared to them, overall. 
---
(note that this sort of playstyle also requires that you are able to have a decent hotkey and/or macro layout so that you can switch between forms at will and still be able to use the various abilities)(it also helps to replace your "form shift" bar with a bunch of macros that first unshift you and then shift you into that form, so that you can instantly removes root/snares whenever you hit a shift change)
---
I know exactly what you mean.
---
How good is Julie's Dagger? Wowhead comments from the past said it's great with 1.30 speed. I picked it up on the AH for only 12g.
---
[wowhead link](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6660/julies-dagger)
---
Nope, Atiesh!
---
Even while leveling people don't try to attack me while at 10% health.     
---
To their defense, I stay with the fingers on the death coil button.
---
Were you Jaya Ballard?
---
*laughs in I work in retail*
---
I still dont really understand the benefit of amplify and dampen magic. You take more or less damage at the cost of healing? I legit have no clue when I should use these in a dungeon.....
---
Idk about tos but let’s be real, it’s a game mechanic that every lock has. Only way to fix it would be to change the way banish works.
---
Lots of people are respeccing 2x a week, and ranking isn't even out yet.
---
I am not the only one?
---
Private servers didn’t have lag nearly to the same point as classic does, it’s shameful blizzards paid product is shittier than what a handful of volunteers can put together and it’s shameful people keep defending blizzard.
---
I'm coming up to 200g as a 57 hunter and I've dropped 250g on gear. Just leveled normally. Quests and a few dungeons. Never got any lucky drops. Maybe because I went herb/skinning and I fish for pet and use the cheaper arrows
---
Yeah... not a bad idea but i was really hoping to hit 60 before phase 2
---
And then blood rage giving you a ton of rage....10% more damage is nothing for a few hits and the amount of AoE damage you do with a single WW while even just having riven spike will make holding threat on the rest of the pull much easier. I also frequently use the cheap rage pots as well which really helps. Again, tanking dungeons as fury prot does suck compared to normal arms or arms prot (especially while gearing still). But I did it as well and it wasn’t too bad doing what I said above. The consumable thing is just something you should get used to anyway cause fury prot really relies on it in raids and the cheap rage pots are very very cheap.
---
Just fyi if you click your link you can see that it says added in content phase 5 at the bottom. So it's not in the game and won't be until phase 5.
---
Strat (both sides) seems to be mage proving ground.
---
It’s nice to come across someone like you in-game, just wish it happened more often, cheers
---
We are basically playing dragon Ball z. It takes 2 years to power up a big enough sprit bomb.
---
That's a refreshingly understanding response. I'm glad you could see it my way.
---
Not in game till phase 5
---
Rogue class hall also mentions specifically that all 3 rogue specs tap into shadow magic to stealth, which is why they turn totally invisible instead of just hiding good
---
I have to get my felhunter out to silence even when a mage is in the group....but I have loads of water and food so 🤷‍♂️
---
In the current meta I think the real question to ask is once you get 60 what are you doing if you aren't working towards better gear.
---
BiS lists should be looked at more like a roadmap than a checklist.  A lot of the pieces aren't very difficult to get, and understanding how your class works can help you optimize your gear to still provide a good boost.
---
If your goal is to raid you aren't a casual player.  That doesn't mean you have farm arena 372 times to get the savage gladiator chain, or lock yourself out of instances constantly searching for Jed.  But it is a pseudo expectation that you know how your class works and you gear yourself appropriately for the content you want to tackle.  
---
If you are being denied a raid spot because your gear isn't perfect pre-raid BiS then you should reconsider your guild choice.  At the end of the day finding a group of people you mesh with is important, they will be more than happy to help you understand your class and gear options for the benefit of the whole team.
---
true. People always just compare raw damage without taking in account everything else.
---
A mage make better damage than a druid, but the mage isn't the one giving more stats and resistances to all the group/raid (making everyone better at their job), nor the guy giving back an entire mana bar for a healer, and even less the one who will save the group of the tank or if the heal die.
---
Melee hunter is *viable* but it's not strict melee, you use your stings. Volley and multishot still, you drop explosive traps in combat, you weave in melee when your abilities are on cooldown. you'll use a ravager, you can use consumables to boost your dps. Alot of the time, you won't be meleeing as it isn't optimal to do so. It's only best to do so during deadzone fights and big aoe fights. 
---
But with the right technique, and gear, you can do more aoe melee dps than a mage, and your melee can and will outdamage your ranged dps.
---
You’re likely right, I’ll take your words to heart, thank you
---
If your canadian that is october :(
---
As a Hunter, I quote this line pretty much any time I PvP with another Hunter.
---
can't levitate over lava iirc
---
either way I didn't have the reagent.
---
5 manned it today. Took 2 tries. Yea its buggy.
---
Yes but get to level 5, then run to Org and ask if anyone can spare some linen bags for a new player. Ask in trade or something, not a private whisper which makes the other person feel guilty. Offer to repay the debt. Be polite and respectful, and someone will probably give you much better than linen.
---
Eye of Shadow is already going down in price, about a month ago I was able to sell one for 500g, now I'm competing with 2-3 other people to sell for 250-300g.
---
With the release of Kazaak there will be more Eye of Shadow drops, so we can assume that the price will drop.
---
That being said... Kazaak is going to be a tough encounter, one player can ruin an entire raid and since the servers can now handle 12k~ people, it's going to be a bloodbath just to kill Kazaak. Considering it is going to be a guild effort in most cases, you can realistically except the EoS to go to one of the priests in that raid.
---
Blizzard has been pretty clear about wanting to keep things as close to their reference client as possible, and since this was looked into on their end already (And easy to fix if it was incorrect) it very much looks to be one of the many things we just didn't know about back in the day. Rather than being wrong. =)
---
a level 40 mage can 1v1 a 60 warrior :p
---
Alliance already sealed their fate. They run around with 10 man death squads,  get put in place, and then wonder why the horde strike back
---
"Rilled your basal instincts", oh man
---
Searing Gorge is a good location.  Wide open and good level mobs.  Tanaris is good too.
---
Sham* on you.
---
&gt; bear threat is ridiculous
---
Is that dependent on MCPs?
---
Shoutout to the Priest that hinted at me how incredibly useful Mind Soothe is. I mean I'm someone who uses every shit he has and I certainly used Mind Soothe before when I saw it fit but I never knew just how big the aggro radius reduce really is. You can skip so much shit by just Mind Soothing everything.
---
My guild does reserve runs for people.  Wondering if I'll get help lol.
---
UBRS trash is serious business!
---
Quality post
---
You know what sounds more boring? Having to wait on the mana users as a non-mana user.
---
Grinding full pre-BiS is certainly valuable and definitely worth your time, however I've found much of the game is lost in the process. If you're not a top percenter you can easily survive paying less attention to it.
---
On my Hunter I'll be getting the pieces I come across for sure, but after Devilsaur I won't be drooling over pre-BiS stuff all day. I'll become a Dragonscale LW and grind out the Black Dragonscale Recipes because they're cool. After those, I'll get t0 and call it a day. With that gear I won't be at the top, but that's not my goal.
---
you dont remember what vanilla was ,clearly
---
You should give it a shot! Check the LFG channel and whisper those in need of a tank.  I usually say something like “hey if you can’t find a tank I’d be happy to run it for green drops or runecloth drops”. Most people will keep looking, but eventually hit you up when no one else bites.
---
BRD runs are the most profitable, especially if you already have the hot items like HOJ. So many green drops and runecloth.  Ask for the greens and you will make about 25 per run, and I can usually clear a full run in an hour. Or join the Arena/Anger runs with the same deal but maybe try to grab the blues no one needs or wants, which can go between 2-4g per blue. That’s like 10g per run and they only take like 20 minutes max. So let them know you will take the blue drops no one wants as payment, most don’t care.
---
Haha good point. None of this matters if he hasn’t trained Growl.
---
why are you crying in hunter when hunters can solo farm like gods and make fuckin bank
---
No image?
---
There was a post yesterday talking about dungeons. The top comment was a guy complaining about groups that invite people who are a little lower level than the rest of the group.
---
U didnt upload an image
---
Not that easy yet a dozen frenchmen somehow figured it out... there are zero excuses.
---
spell crits only do 50% more damage, not 100%.
---
What if it was just one Hunter with six guns?
---
Yeah so imagine the voracity with which people attack you in STV, except that's basically anywhere you someone now.

fixd
---
This is serious for anyone asking
---
I've had someone print out an error message, hand that to another person, who then takes a photo of that print out with their camera phone and sends us that photo of a print out of an error message.
---
It's not disrespectful.
---
I'm agreeing with you in that if I had kept pugging, I would have burnt out too.  
---
But because I found a solid guild with players who I trust know what their doing, I can tank more relaxed, at my own pace (which they let me cause I'm the only damn tank in the guild).
---
from the research i have done it is only very few specific weapon procs, outliers rather than the rule.
---
Instant BG ques. I’m down wit it
---
That's why I put in the part about assuming the talent that raises it to 100%. Anyone tossing frostbolts in MC would have to be incredibly ignorant to not have it.
---
Not everyone is at the same level of progress. My guild started clearing MC on week 2 but that doesn't mean everyone else did.
---
Also, some dps items are BiS for tanks and sometimes items they need don't drop. (shocking!)
---
I thought it was a paint brush painting a metal thing yellowish green.
---
Because that’s not the case when leveling...? We have to spend a ton of money on pet food, water and arrows
---
Unlikely that they will open any new servers in the next few months.
---
I saw HOJ drop 3 time in a row and ended up rolling need on it for Offspec (I'm resto shaman)
---
Always saw a swinging axe... until today.
---
This is the way to finish it: Have only one person drop the bag, then have that person stay at the bag the entire time, just stay put. Everyone else can protect the npc’s.   
---
If the person who drops the bag moves away from it, it bugs out.
---
If you place more than one bag, it can big out too.
---
Forsure warriors are a great class, dont get me wrong. Mages just have such a good kit. 
---
and honestly warriors kind of suck in PvP unless they have a healbot / dispeller or are chugging free actions pots
---
Or any caster in general. Or a hunter.
---
This is the first one i hadn't seen before of the ones posted recently (although i kinda prefer to think of it as the iron parrot)
---
Part of the reason we never saw feral players in Vanilla was because of the talent trees. Until AQ innervate was the 31st talent point in Resto.  DPS was considerably lower because we didn’t know what we were doing, didn’t itemize as well as we do now, didn’t have the end state item changes we have now (giving us more raw stats), and didn’t have 1.12 talent trees.
---
When every boss in MC falls down in sub 1 minute mana isn’t an issue at all and innervates aren’t as needed as they once were. And they’re baseline for Druids so it doesn’t matter anyway. Paladins are beasts now that Holy Shock is more than just an offensive spell, so healing doesn’t fall squarely on the backs on priests like it did in Vanilla.
---
Add all of that together and you get viability for feral Druids! They’re not great main tanks, but they will remain viable through Naxx and are amazing in fights like Twin Emps (in AQ40) and Patchwerk (in Naxx)
---
Really? Don’t know if it is the time I play or what. But never felt we were that outrageously outnumbered. Yes horde is definitely the majority. But not so bad that you couldn’t get some alliance down to help push back.
---
100% works on unit frames. Clique wasn't working for me early on in classic so I made a mouseover macro
---
Maybe a noob question..... but how do you have spaces in your name?
---
Do you have succubus? Great time to practice seducing , doing damage with shadowbolt/searing pain , and reseducing
---
Same.  Always thought it was a claw.
---
He's so enthusiastically..... begging?
---
(If you're not trolling I'm going to call you painfully naive)
---
Lol, what? Would it also be “pretty BM” to roll on items you need to level once before equipping? I understand the stance that everyone can roll need because it’s money, but in what world do you need a recipe less just because you can’t consume it on the spot?
---
[Wow looks like I was wrong!  Look at all these top 10 dps hunters in the top speedrun guilds I guess I forgot about!](https://imgur.com/a/KjkbalB)
---
Probaby, but would be slow enough to not be worth it.
---
Bear threat is strong baseline and MCP allows it to go to infinity basically.  Or at least as high as you need it. Dps can go balls deep if the Druid goes full MCP. 
---
In general you don’t need to use MCP every fight as a bear, whereas with Cat if you want to boost those numbers it’s MCP 24/7 on bosses.
---
Possibly coords with no decimal? CL = Current Location? No idea dude sorry
---
Did you make those boots yourself? They’re awesome
---
Isnt it the other way around?

Spriest is even easier as you can mind soothe and just walk around the right side straight to the bugs avoiding all the hyenas
---
no, sadly disengage is just a threat lowering ability, no backward leap.
---
I used to love this skill in WOTLK because with good timing and mouse control (easy to learn), that is also a great forward jump.
---
Also it saves you from high falls if activated at the last moment :)
---
I would like to use eviscerate but alas....
---
If you just killing some mobs yeah but mages usually like to flex their aoe skills and use 15 spells at the same time
---
56 Warlock here. PVP server. In a sizable guild.
---
I have 300 tailoring. I was intending on doing 300 Enchanting but it's such a bore/drag. Would it save me money if I switch to Alchemy and buy raw mats off the auction house? Just being able to make pots for PVP and raiding seems like I'd save a little money compared to buying the pots outright.
---
Was running a few instances today as a healer but I'm shadow spec so was feeling the mana burn.  Suppose it keeps me on my toes though. So... 
---
Thanks hunters?
---
Yea i did this a few days ago and it was really easy we even ran on  few eggs for the lulz
---
I did that when classic came out, and throughout stockades I can't it was extremely fast, but i can say that exp was around 70exp per mob, so it wasn't that amazing but from my experience as a mage getting to 60 doing aoe farming is that id still prefer 3 mages in a 5man than 10man, felt faster, and i personally thought it was better exp.
---
That’s the spirit, keep workin at it

I’m trying to see it but I can’t... all I see is an axe.
