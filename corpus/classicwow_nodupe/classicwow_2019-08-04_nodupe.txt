Probably better off selling the thorium bars?

I wouldn't mind cosmetic pets, relm transfer would be fine down the line.
---

---
Anything that impacts mounts or character appearance would suck.

It depends. There are so many consumables that you will find profit margins if you look hard enough. People are lazy and would rather buy a finished potion than to make their own.
---
I've already purchased the game more than once, and all expansions through Cata twice, and MoP-Legion.
---
I would not play if I had to purchase it again, and it's far and away my favorite game of all time.
---
Do some math? 230,000 signed the petition to get classic, there are a damn site more that will play it, that is 3.5 million per month at least, when most peoples expectations will have classic in the millions of users, i would say being conservative and guess a million resubs (money they did not have coming in before) so about 15 mil.
---
You assume much when you hold up the other purchases as an example, fact is the retail game is bleeding subs and has been for a good long while, getting people re subbed and playing either version is going to make them money...they whole reason they are doing it is because it will make money, if they didn't think so then they would have just not bothered.
---
Yeah having an insanely short draw distance was very difficult to figure out, and fun to play!
---
Crown is missing, but the trail is there.
---
It should be, I believe they have servers in both Chicago and LA
---
No point monetising a dead game.
---
Heh, I did that the first time around, explored everywhere, read every line of text and finished every quest. I never did the power leveling thing before in Vanilla

Unarmored mounts. They were in the game and this would allow people to get them "without rushing" or whatever their excuse was.

What about purely cosmetic items that have no stats, like a cool looking hat? (I'm not advocating, just curious.)
---
https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/
---
In my opinion, it will have things like:
---
- character re-customization (for example haircuts, classic has no barber shop as far as i know);
---
- realm transfer (probably after the last phase and only if population starts to decline);
---
- things like race change, name change probably won't be in the shop, because identity has a semnificative role in classic;
---
-mounts, pets, cosmetics etc. won't be available for purchase, i think they want to keep that for bfa.
---
I can't think of anything else.
---
Flasks were barely in demand before C'thun/Naxx - they were mainly used for tanks on special occasions before that.
---
In fact, they didn't even persist through death until 1.7.
---
Now we have limited lotus, flasks that persist through death, tryhard guilds going for week/day one kills, and people fully aware of how powerful flasks are - so no, they'll be much more expensive than they were in vanilla.
---
Might have to try find mine in storage, best toilet read
---
No in game shop is acceptable, dont even want paid server xfers. 
---
No pets, definitely no mounts, and no fucking xmog. NONE 
---
developers beware, implement mtx if u dare
---
I have seen people trying out some backstab specs basically you need to have enough damage to ambush gouge backstab evis and hopefully finish up mobs with that. Now what exactly is the best way early lvl is really hard to tell. Although I would really recommend getting the +5 hit from combat so that your abilities actually land when you open with ambush.
---
They basically do that though you get rep for your race faster simply by questing in the zone up until the war effort
---
Have you heard of frontstab? Not sure if you're able to in classic but that would help leveling a ton.
---
What do they affect? They don't stop you from doing any content. They don't stop you from doing PvP. The only thing it mildly effects is farming time it greatly affects nothing in the game and has no effect on anyone else in the game.
---
You can't use the bank undercity is under attack
---
per character per day. Limited time only!
---
Yes. That’s why you want to do it as soon after your auto as possible.
---
Just clueless bud, I could never be as enlightened as you.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Tabard of flame/frost? Ehh still would suck to see a real money shop
---
Come join the horde we have scarlet monestary so close to undercity.
---
You argue against me, then agree with my sarcasm by saying having a second Druid makes everyones experience worse.  Your heads going to explode trying to figure that one out.

Everywhere varimathrias is in the throne room
---
Says the guy caught buying gold on pservers lol
---
Honestly I know I wouldnt mind paying a lot THAT much, but I know it would discourage the friends I want to see come back. So that would ruin the game for me
---
can't wait to suck the dick of the company that axed nost and then told us we were delusional to find it fun
---
No offense but saying the gear isn’t meaningful in the least in retail is very misinformed. If you want to clear HM and above you’re going to sim your character and determine what stats you’re looking for, which traits/essences and so on. You don’t have to shit on retail to appreciate classic you know - they’re two different games and I love them both
---
Nope never ever ever
---
Yeah it's him
---
If 1 million people will sub for classic and lets say each sub is 15$, does it mean blizzard will make 15 million bucks from the launch of classic?
---
Sure no problem. Every quest is started, completed and returned at a point in time (and tagged as such) and everything is indexed in chronological order. Based on the brief video, it probably wouldn't be all that difficult to write a script that converted my data into a usable format for the add-on.
---
It's a cool add-on idea, I just don't know what would happen if you imported 60 levels worth of data at once and how readable it would be.
---
So you're saying you haven't used different accounts on r/classicwow (mostly because you keep getting banned)?
---
Need more info. Easiest way is probably an addon that all must install to participate distributed at the start of the event so nobody has time to figure out how to spoof.
---
Correct.
---
where is this from?

Lol.

take post down and reupload with codes blocked, someone could try and claim your account with that information.
---
Hard cap should be higher than 14
---
no yes, thanks for clarification. I guess it makes sense after such a stressful time, which it probably was. Its just that I personally felt that after a breakup/divorce, I view things as games as pretty mundane regarding what I care about in life, and I mainly play to distract from other stuff tbh. I understand other views tho too
---
Good. But only if it cost the original 1000g. And maybe had an expiration date. Swap specs as much as you want for X days, but then you have to buy it again.
---
maybe, idk yet
---
I think it would be good, but you should only be able to swap in town. Then again, I don’t trust Blizzard anymore to start changing things ‘their own way’. So better leave everything as is.
---
I remember doing SM as alliance this one time.  
---
It was a huge run - Ironforge to Southshore, thru silverpine then across tirisfal.

We were nearly there then i got perma DC'd. LOL

Fun is a valid reason, gear is another.
---
Bad. Every single thing in classic is a part of the classic design system based on a specific effort and reward system. Changes cut into that. Whether or not we find Value in the things we do in that game is on us. Whether or not it feels like work or like fun is on us
---
lol jesus christ.  I'm happy that you're opting to continue on a private server........right?
---
Both accounts have to have the same last name. I’ve gifted my brothers characters.
---
im down to discuss this 6 months after naxx
---
gotta let classic run its course with no changes tho
---
you're 100% right
---
Doesn't work
---
I'm saying specifically Blackrock Depths gear is essentially pointless at the point you get it in retail. BRD feels like a waste of time when it's not meaningful gear.
---
Not referring to retail as a whole
---
Perfectly designed then. More content is a good thing!
---
Because there's more to the world than just America (and prices vary).
---
You have to distinguish between raids and 5mans when arguing that elitists are incentivising people from rolling tanks. Because a lot of a that feedback is down to raids, where druids are indeed less desirable - or at least not as desirable in the number of people interested in playing druid tanks. As for prot pally, it just isn't good and only works if the pally tank and the group know exactly what they're doing.
---
Lying to people about the viability of their character would be incredibly unfair. If that means there's going to be less tanks for 5man runs that is sad but still preferable to someone putting several weeks into a character only to find themselves unwanted or unable to perform.
---
Great point on the intro.
---
I think he meant the gear from BRD isnt meaningful in retail.
---
Ahhh I see, thanks for clearing that up!
---
I let my mom throw that away when she sold her house a few years ago that I grew up in playing wow vanilla. Definitely regret that.
---
I have not thought about a add on, might work. But might complicate things for 100-200 plus player battle.
---
Any amount. Gimme my world of warcraft.
---
Show me your sims where you are testing what BRD gear you need to swap in to clear HM.
---
I'll wait.
---
If I had to pay for a game that I already own I’d be annoyed. Maybe like $20 would be my max.
---
No changes
---
There's no way they only launch 3 NA pvp realms.  We'll see Aug 12 when they allow people to make characters.
---
Alliance.
---
It hasn’t been announced but some people who visited and betatested inhouse (sadly I can’t recall his or any of the others’ names) said that Blizzard were positive towards it if people wanted it. Could of course be just something they said but I think that is the natural course if Classic is successful in Blizzard’s eyes.
---
Almost as cool as you having 150+ posts on r/classicwow in the last 24 hours despite only being active for a total of a day on that account.

Dodgy is just mad that he can’t buy gold directly from the devs of this server by using his “Pserver vet” status.
---

---
I never had a chance to play Nostalrius before it was shut down, I was so disappointed when I saw the news, I thought for sure we would never see Classic. But here we are, less than a month away from release!
---
Solution: Quit being poor.
---
THANKS!
---
Reality for many of us
---
&gt; The solution is simple - we need more people playing tanks.
---
We just need the DPS warriors to tank for a change
---
They will profit off subscriptions alone. They always have they always will. They don't sell all the pets and mounts and everything else because they are losing money, it's because subscription profit alone was no longer acceptable to shareholders, they always have to meet their targets and those targets are always raised. 
---
The game would still be profitable off pure subscription as long as the content was good enough to keep people engaged
---
It really is crazy to think about how many hours have to be filled in for. Took 2 weeks off my cooking job and i never take vacation.
---
Well, now it's 2.
---
I talk alot of classic with some guild mates of mine . Texting back and fourth I must have added it to my dictionary by accident. Thanks for such great concern though, oh great internet warden.
---
All this cock talk, made my day
---
I played my fair share of runescape but then I found guild wars and really liked it. But friends in school were all playing WoW and telling me I should play it, my thoughts when looking at it was that guild wars looked much better.
---
But they all kept on playing it and I finally got interested enough and asked a friend to try out their account. Man what an eye opener that was, the game world was huge and unlike guild wars players were roaming around the game world normally and like OP mentioned being able to jump was awesome.
---

I meant in terms of hub activity. Everyone congregates around SW or ORG. Getting rep for those factions is done by questing in zones. I mean, actually getting game players to be there, offer them a discount for being in their "home" city. not just an exalted one. like less discount on deposits, a portal only you can use, cheaper costs of mail etc. can be rep locked as well but mainly be race locked. so undead end up in UC, Taurens hang around in TB, Orcs and Trolls in Org. you can go elsewhere but for it to be your main base would cost you. I just think it would add to the world feel.
---
TBC/Wotlk were actually fun, I guess that’s a pretty big difference
---
Ultimately, yeah. There's very little legal precedent on any of this. Another post mentions that there was recently a decision made in regards to *abandoned* games, but there's still no word in regards to older versions of an *active* game.
---
the aura buff only works in one party... id rather have a solid dps instead of an oomkin
---
Might be the best orc hunter Role Play pet!
---
Yup.
---
PUGs are PUGs; this has always been the case. Why would you expect any different this time around? I'd recommend doing guild runs instead if you don't want to be inconvenienced.
---
Yes. I want gaming companies to stop making accountants their CEO's. It's bad for the game. Look at retail.
---
Hey thanks dude
---
Why did they suck during vanilla?
---
Companies don't build each new product with the intent of being its most profitable offering. Look at car manufacturers or graphics cards or processors -- there are always a bunch of different tiers to meet different market needs. 
---
Classic is similar to that. It's an expansion of Blizzard's portfolio, and while it probably won't rival the per-player profit of retail, it will likely bring in a decent number of people who aren't really interested in retail. 
---
It's also an experiment. Although EverQuest continues to produce new expansions, their legacy servers -- basically classic wow, but with a structured expansion release schedule -- have brought back a ton of players that aren't interested in retail. They also provide a relatively easy, cheap way of keeping subscriptions high, letting them fund other things.
---
I feel yea. I just reply the same way because the majority of people coming to play classic wow are in for a treat when they realize you'll be putting 100s of hours in. 
---
Fun leveling though if your ready for the grind.
---
Just do quest till around 20. Depending on if your horde or alliance. Pick up instance quests and do them.  
---
To really give you an idea on a fun path I'd have to know what race your making.  Each race has different starting zones and different areas you can get to with out a long journey (Took me 5 hours as a night elf to run to iron forge to the next quest area) Because I wanted to goto westfall.
---
Theres a lot of things. Drowned in this hype lol.
---
You will run out of quests in each area. That point is were you will end up grinding. Look up the different areas so you can enjoy it
---
I personally recommend night elf for alliance (The best starting atmosphere) or on Horde Undead. Their areas are more fun.
---
Even bs spec, you are absolutely fine for leveling. It's like a 10% difference between specs at most.
---
A lot. Som classes can save like 20+ gold
---
Realm transfers only. Microtransactions in a game for which you already pay a subscription are one of the main reasons I quit retail at the end of wrath. I tolerated it with realm transfers since I felt the charge prevented widespread use of transfers which would be devastating for server identity/community, but when they added that mount and my subscription no longer paid for the whole game I quit. Not that activision will care, if they think they can make a buck they'll do it anyway, screw what anyone thinks.
---
yes, but they need to focus on gameplay first. Look at what happened to retail. They keep putting stuff in the cash shop for people to buy. They are focused on making money first. I get that, however, if you make a solid game and focus on gameplay and story then the money will come a lot easier.
---
I tested every spec to compare leveling times.
---
If you must go that spec you posted, go combat first for that 30% crit, then go sub, then assassination. 
---
It's gonna add four whole days /played to hit 60 though. At 40, even with the best dagger / gear possible, you still fall behind combat swords.
---

---
Monetization doesn't necessarily mean evil. Cosmetics and loot boxes that are irrelevant and optional to my experience doesn't seem evil. All companies, including Blizzard, are intended to make money. Every dollar above the line is worth getting. You can't get mad at Blizzard for doing what very literally all companies do. I still love Blizzard games, and WoW might be the only exception to this - store mounts suck. They remove the accomplishment that we want as traditional RPG players. The fact of the matter is that WoW peaked at WoTLK and has decreased in value ever since. They need to continue to make the same amount of money each year, otherwise the project receives less funding. 
---
Quarterly review, cut costs, increase throughput. 
---
As far as "crunch" goes, the reality is that game studios (mine included) set deadlines. Software is fickle. Even the greatest of engineers can underestimate time budgets. I myself have been through the crunch and, though it isn't fun, it's just the reality of promising a product to the customers and doing your best to meet your own deadlines.
---
I think everybody there is still shocked by the classic fanbase. They were surprised at people still playing the hell out of the beta lmao. Those of us left at the end you couldn't tear us away.  Ever thought I'd put in 20 days played, but here we are. 
---
I bring that up because it shows it's just as good as we remember. That specifically showed them we do really want it, and how bad. Shit at lvl 40 we were getting deathrays farming lvl 58 elites.
---
If that's really the spec you want to end up with, then this is the order I recommend: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=rogue&amp;t=uNuOtktRtmtwtvtltStTueumunuoupuIuJuKuPuSuTuLuMu9uDuEuFuGuHuyuzuUuVu8u5u6u7uWu~u-vavbvct~ufugtYt8urusut
---
Expensive respecs are a major factor in Classic WoW. The idea was that you might want to respec every now and again for a change of pace, or because you got some new gear, or some new content came out. Specifically, it WASN'T for players to play multiple specs with the same character all the time.
---
If you want to play heal and DPS with the same character, try a mixed/hybrid spec that takes bits of both. Similar deal for raiding vs. PvP. Or Group vs. Solo content (something a lot of Warriors did was a mixed Arms/Prot spec, which got the key tanking talents then put the rest in Arms for Mortal Strike). You won't be thr best at either but you can definitely be "good enough."
---
Dual Spec (or Cheap Respecs) kill this, and with it you lose the only in-game incentive to do anything other than follow a particular cookie-cutter spec you found online.
---
So, no thank you.

| NA Server TBA | Alliance-PVE | Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding]
---
* **ABOUT US**
---
Looking for a casual raiding guild that'll still progress, are adults, aren't up their own asses and just want to make new memories in classic with you?
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
* **GOALS**
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec / Jan or so. However, I want you to take your time. Smell the roses etc. Once we’re all hitting max level and have some early dungeon gear we WILL be raiding and taking it fairly seriously.
---
* **RAID SCHEDULE (Central Standard Time)**
---
We're thinking weekends in the evening once MC gets underway. 2 nights a week (Fri Sat or Sat Sun) with a much more casual mid week raid night that’ll be ZG / AQ 20 etc. 
---
* **LOOT**
---
DKP and Loot Council with a stronger emphasis on DKP. There’s rare exceptions we might allow someone to get an advance on their DKP (tanks healers) for the sake of progression. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins. 
---
* **EXPECTATIONS**
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules and policies etc.

Put whatever you want in there. Won't impact me at all as I'll be gone the moment it shows up.
---
Never said that. I think they made leveling too easy in retail. They made it all about end game and everything before that is useless. In classic the story lines kept up in end game too. Why can't you group with people while leveling in retail? They level to fast and there is no community focus anymore like in vanilla. The problem is "leveling for months and never grouping". Why would you not group if leveling wasn't so easy? why not group now? Because there is no community. People don't care about the people in their groups. If EVERYONE had to grind to max level like the old days they would group up. Saying they wouldn't group till max level wouldn't be the case.
---
It might not be needed on everyone. If enough people have it that all of the kills are tracked in logs/ honorable kills or whatever you should be able to tell the general k/d of the whole battle. Once one faction reaches like 5 kills to every death you could declare them the winner as the other faction is basically routed.
---
Thgh to hhhy the
---
See where I said i've never heard about the addon till today? I am on reddit and the classic forums every day. I've never heard of it. It may not be as wide spread as you think. I don't want it to be either. I want people in the chat channels like we did in classic. I plan to have a vanilla mind set. I know my guild does too.
---
On my warlock and mage, no 
---
On my spriest who is herb/ALCHEMIST, yes he'll also be my cook/fisherman
---

No, it has nothing to do with some perceived lack of community in Retail and everything to do with everyone else already being at a level relevant to the latest expansion.
---
&gt; And the "I play with no screen and no sound" challenge?
---
Also known as the Hellen Keller challenge.
---
And the total time of them being CC'd is less than if you just fd/trap.
---
I leveled a Hunter with a Bat on classic beta to 30. You cannot sustain Bite and Screech spam when you chain pull, uinfortunately. The headache to learn Screech Rank 2 and Bite Rank 2/3 may also not be worth it as Claw is easier to pick up in the Barrens.
---
All in all I would not recommend it and at least myself I will just get a scorp, then a cat in the barrens.
---
as you do not appear to have a basic grasp on hyperbole, i'll break it down for you: i did not mean they are literally saying the word sjw. i mean they are, in this thread and many others, basically saying blizzard has cultivated a very controlled environment where language like the kind used in the op will be seen as ''not pc'' and get you muted/banned. the language used may be something along the lines of too fragile, too sensitive, sjw, pc, special snowflake, ect but it all means the same thing. obviously, this is not the case, as we can see by this post. it really just depends on who (if anybody) is reporting you.
---
meanwhile people act like current blizzard is a dystopian hellscape where saying the f-word in public or ganking someone will make daddy blizzard come to your house and execute you. in reality the only noticeable change will be 5% less white supremacy in chat

---
Its about courtesy and respecting your fellow player not about the number of invites per hour. If I message someone and get a reply I appreciate it, so I treat others the way I like to be treated.
---
I really don't think the decisions you're referencing are done out of laziness. I think if the team making Classic really were trying to do it with as little time invested as possible, they wouldn't have taken another look at their 4 phase cycle they initially described. Nor would they have gone through all the effort with this beta test and trying to address the bugs and inconsistencies they can.
---
They, and I think a lot of other people, *do* think that 1.12 itemisation and talents will make for a better game, even if slightly less authentic. And I genuinely think they believe layering will make the launch experience smoother (even if I, also, personally disagree).
---
Don't get me wrong, fuck Activision-Blizzard. But I really don't think many of the individual actions taken by this development team are being done to make things easier on them. Call the team wrong or incompetent if you'd like, but I don't think greedy or lazy is correct.
---
Yeah players did do that. They complained because classes they thought were always gimped or lacking some sort of utility like a CC break. The game was unbalanced so some classes were exceptional at specific things while others for example support classes weren’t great at one thing but not terrible either. So there would be full class reworks and then classes that hadn’t gotten one in awhile would be ticked so over time Blizzard just made them all the same and balanced. Players absolutely helped cause the pruning.
---
Same. I also queue directly for LBRS as soon as its available and do nothing else till 60. What I like about those John Staats dungeons is how much you can bring to the table just by knowing the layout cold. People hate getting LBRS when they queue randoms and it is a huge relief to hit the jackpot with a competent tank in there.
---
FD trap is too wonky to consistently land even with a macro and trying to guess what direction someone will move in...  Scatter nearly always gauruntees they will get frozen...  And even with DR it is worth it, especially mid fight in PvP.  I did so much freeze trapping in vanilla, I know how it felt back then.  I get the feeling it feels different somehow based on people talking about it.  Maybe servers are better now and FD trap will work consistently? not sure, but I damn well know if someone is moving you got to somehow lay the trap in their path which is not ways perfectly predictable and certainly harder on some players strafing around like nuts.  Best bet was to scatter to gauruntee a freeze.
---
It's pandoras box.
---
I'm not saying that the change would be all bad, but it is the road that retail WoW took and it is a game I feel is worse than back in the day.
---
Its been debated hundreds of times before. And no its an unacceptable change. It would severely change all aspects of the game and in my and most peoples opinion, in a bad way.
---
I'll take all the shop items. Pets, mounts, toys, boosts, and especially WoW tokens. Yes please!
---
The 4 phase cycle is evidence that the entire project was created as a cash grab. The fact that they reconsidered was only after mass outcry.
---
Hi,
---
They are not telling you to combine paladin and shaman numbers, but to adjust for faction size (it's a form of data normalization to account for difference in scale) if you want a more accurate and representative distribution of classes rather than just the raw count data. If the latter be the case, you are right, no adjustments are needed. 
---
But by doing so, a more accurate gauge can be made of potential future groups. E.g. you can estimate which classes might have a shortage for your faction, or even realm if you go further. If you do not adjust, it might look like there are only a few paladins and a massive amount of warriors, which is true on the global raw count scale, but false when you actually want to gain any useful representative information from this data. 
---
I.e. when you arrive at the Deadmines, you will see a lot less Mâydiés and a lot more Árthäs' than the poll suggests.
---
&gt;Your family takes precedence over your games, that's totally fair, but that's very different from suggesting that your family/choices give you the right to mess up *my* games. 
---
I agree with the point being made in principle, believe me, but people, in general, don't care about your time being spent in multiplayer games. The reality is you're playing an MMO filled with potential jerks. People who, at level 1, will be mob-tagging everything in sight so you can't quest. People who will corpse camp you in contested zones for fun, at *your* expense because you decided to log in. People griefed the hell out of each other in vanilla over herb/mining nodes and they probably will do so in classic. So the expectation that people should be reasonable and not "mess up your games" is naive at best. 
---
Regardless of if people have children to look after, homework to do, or their dog is about to spontaneously combust, people will do what they like with the time they have.
---
They can just change it?
---
In my first post I said it wasn't in vanilla.
---
Mages aren't underrated but they are high skillcap.
---
People will defend the status quo, whether it makes sense or not.
---
Yeah it makes no sense. JC and sockets in weapons came in TBC and Cataclysm was coming after Wotlk so no-one knew pandaren were coming.
---
All i know is scorpions in durotar drops a lot of decent vendor items. They have a chance to drop their eye that vendors for 95c which is pretty good for being lvl 5-10, but you asked for 10-20 and idk about that sorry
---
Only with 24/7 no lifing and a stockpile of poopsocks.
---
This is how I remember healing in vanilla, but I did play the horde, so idk.
---
ha i was technically correct, the best kind of correct.
---
My quick input, as a resto druid you have some clutch tanking ability for if things go wrong. As a shaman healer u have tons of utility in ur totems. Both are really fun and have big toolkits.
---
Anyone heavily into WoW and Warcraft would have been excited about the TBC and even more so about Wotlk as the lore was great. How's life otherwise? Still living in mom's basement to fight off nasty change?
---
Penis vagina shit fuck
---
I reply to everyone, but it's not important for tanks to reply to people at all. Tanks can be the biggest assholes in the game, if they're skilled they're getting invites.
---
By the time you've purged all the Mage's buffs, you're dead.
---
well the new expansions are designed to appeal to more people, right? 
---
but classic is designed to appeal to those of us who played vanilla and they will only alienate people if it turns out to be inauthentic
---
rofl because people gonna go back to what they know, plenty dont give a fuck and will do what we've been doing since pservers and vanilla
---
Then pay the gold for that flexibility.
---
Not true at all, world PvP was huge in tbc

Fucked around with alts, but my first character (shaman) stayed my main throughout classic.   Missed tbc and came back for wotlk switched servers and factions to plah with friends leveled a lock to 60 to unlock DK and played that as my main.
---
Leeway only increases range when the attacker and the target are moving. It won't help you get behind the target at all.
---
As someone who didn’t play private servers until after Classic was announced just to play around a bit, what was so special about Nostalrius? Weren’t there always plenty of private servers? And the ones I played on all seemed pretty solid are they downgrades from what Nostalrius was?

I played mage through cata and came back in wod on the same mage. Always had other alts but never had a different main until legion when i mained DH

Now in bfa i main lock and dh

In classic i plan to play heal druid and maybe splash lock and maybe splash warrior

Sure, you can macro equip a dagger and Ambush before macroing back to your non-dagger, but you're better off just using Garrote or Cheap Shot.
---
YES!
---
That’s what she said
---
Ressan the needler is a very good bat to get. Has a silence for casters that would come in handy for you Hunters
---
You could use it, but the whole point is if you don't feel like questing, or can't, due to bottlenecks. You'll make more gold than questing and level trade skills but at the cost of faster leveling times.
---
lvl34, but getting there. I keep my single game strong!
---
Was that an immediate thing? I remeber faction changes was way later
---
I have recently learned that they will be starting in 1.12 so they wont be terrible, but og druids were relegated to supplemental healing and motw. They could certainly heal in their own right but the later rework made it possible to tank in bear and dps in cat form similar to warrior and rogue. 
---
The later rework just further improved their jack of all trades abilities. They didn't exactly suck but they were improved in the later patches. No one wanted a feral speced druid (dont think they ever got arcane in the right spot). The rework made them pvp viable as well as well as being pve viable (in both specs).
---
But to be honest, this was so fucking long ago I don't know what the fuck to expect and I was dumb and in my late to early 20s. All I know is I'm rolling my NE druid.
---
That's impressive.  My rerolled druid currently sits at 85. I log on briefly every now and then to admire some of my old set pieces but that's about it
---
I have a hard time believing sub count has dropped so low. Would be very interested in seeing any evidence of the number is remotely close
---
Their hope is that if you come back and don't like Classic maybe you'll like BFA, since you're subbed anyway.
---
Classic provides the old school, more hardcore experience, BFA the new wave of MMOs where everything is more accessible and streamlined.
---
They can't go wrong with it. I'm shocked it took them so many years to realise this. It's a brilliant move from a marketing point of view. They invest minimally and stand to gain millions of dollars in the first month alone.
---
I would agree.  Druids definitely were
---
I am going warrior, and my wife is going priest. For leveling together, should she go shadow or holy?
---
it would be silly to expect to retain classic players by way of a new retail expansion, there's far too many differences in the gameplay.
---
more likely is just that blizzard monitors how many unique accounts are playing classic, how many people are getting into MC/BWL/AQ/Naxx, and what the subscription curve looks like after releasing the final phase.
---
i'm skeptical that they will release BC and further expansions. but speaking as someone who really only played vanilla, i would certainly enjoy having the chance to play through BC and beyond. but i would not be interested in jumping from naxx to retail due to the vast differences in gameplay
---
[Truth](https://youtu.be/PDNZX2nql2Y) He will end up being right.
---
I disagree with the talents thing. Even though you have these large trees, there are only a few optimal builds that can move a handful of points around in them. Sure, there are thousands of bad talent builds, but that is what gives the illusion of choice.
---
Class identity on the other hand is a huge issue in BfA. Its centered around the fact that you play a specialization and not a class and all specializations of a certain role have the same basic tools as all the others.
---
Honestly... I’d pay like upwards of $200 to play classic WoW... it would take a lot of money for me to say no, and even then I would most likely beg for donations from friends and family.
---
Leveled a nelf druid to like 15 switched to undead warrior and that has been life ever since.
---
Not sure why they are being downvoted.    This is correct.  We know furyprot will take a hit in classic, and it's really not a spec 99,99% of people should be using regardless.    It's a niche spec for speed clears.  It really makes no sense for anyone else to try to use it.
---
LOL for the past ten years 99% of the crafts should have just said:
---
Sacrifice X Mats for 1 skill point...maybe
---
It still means that before the change, you could mix from the trees and be unique. In Retail, you only get one tree with 3 choices per the 7 levels.
---
That's a strange way to spell Thex.
---
Came from diablo, my brother was always way more into Warcraft and I was more into scbw and LoD.  Tried a NE hunter for a few levels, then he said a class could straight up go invisible and just gank people.  Immediately sold.
---
I’m confused warriors don’t heal?
---
Make it cost 1k gold to unlock, keep having a cost for making changes to your spec and having to go to a trainer to change between your two specs
---
If you keep it like that, then I don’t mind it. I think it could be a help for people who aren’t too into alts
---
They could also add a Cooldown between changing your spec, so you have to think ahead before changing between them
---
But it doesn’t matter what we think, cause they won’t add it
---
The gameplay isn't *that* different. And besides, no one knows what the next expansion will bring to classes, spells, rotations, talents, etc. Blizzard has made huge changes before and if they want to convert Classic players over, they will again. We do know that it will have a level squish, which means Blizzard could even let Classic players transfer over and still be ready for the new content alongside all Retail players.
---
Being able to save a second spec: yes
---
But it should still cost gold to respec every time. Saving it would be super handy tho
---
Don’t worry, there’s a ton of people with that same mind set, even more than the classic community.
---
I’m personally a BC fanboy, but WOTLK was the height of player subs, and I’ve seen so many people hoping this leads to BC and WOTLK.  I know the pure classic+ players don’t want that to happen, but I’d much rather have BC / wotlk begin to go into a + mode with alternative timeline, while keeping the things that made vanilla, BC, and wotlk amazing at the forefront. (And this is the general populations hopes. So many people are playing classic solely for the hope it heads that direction)
---
Your not alone, mate.
---
And the best part is, if you're an annoying little twit like that, your reputation on Classic will follow you.
---
Yeah get out of our beloved subreddit, your beliefs are invalid and deserve to be shut down
---
Rogue to 60. Hunter to 60. Priest to 60.

Priest is love. Priest is life.

My guild is planning to have 4 separate raid groups.  One of them will go 10 am to 1230 est wednesday thursday friday.

I was watching it online with my fiancée who started in Legion. I just kept saying “No way” when he was talking about ice cream and got super excited when he said vanilla. She had no idea why I was so excited because she had no idea what vanilla is.
---
Her and I scheduled a week off to grind on launch.
---
That's not how I meant it.  I was talking more about personalities.  Sometimes you just don't get along with people.
---
People are apparently forgetting that a big part of the community did ask for easier dungeon access (LFD) and easier Raid access (LFR) so they did listen to the community and added it which in turn caused other people to be unhappy.
---
Point is: Every player has his own wishlist and obviously Blizzard won't be able to make everyone happy.
---
Do they listen to the Community these days? Not really, and for good reason imho as you have seen what a shitshow it is.
---
Damned if you listen, damned if you don't listen.
---
Ah exactly the color of my balls right now.
---
Due to inflation the cost of WoW has gone down each month. It’s getting cheaper to play every day, don’t be silly.
---
Bfa I can mushroom stamp my keyboard and clear a raid. All pre-raidfinder expansions are better. Including the ass end of cata.
---
Hunters take a lot less damage than those melee classes which scale so hard so there is a ton of value in that.
---
It's always hilarious when I hear about Flying ruining W-PVP despite it ceasing to exist for the most part (outside of a few skirmishes from time to time) due to the addition of Battlegrounds.
---
Flying didn't ruin W-PVP, Battlegrounds did but no one really wants to admit that as it was a part of Classic.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Then what you seek is the Group Finder, not the Dungeon Finder.
---
If im going to tank dungeons at 60 do I want to build a tank set more than just a sword/shield? If so how should I go about doing it and what are some crucial items? Thanks
---
Nah, there were plenty of PVE realms with high populations: https://web.archive.org/web/20061113194222/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/serverstatus.php
---
And Blizzard is doing everything they can to make sure every realm is high population. 70% of players saying they'll be on a PVP realm just means there will be more PVP realms down the road.
---
Warrior so you can get groups easily
---
It was already aged when milked.

You know there are multiple races with dark skin hues, right? Yes, that would be racism. You can be a bigot to your own race. Plenty of people are self hating.
---
I don't understand how you can't comprehend that people who say racist things are racist. It's like listening to a guy make jokes about beating his wife. Every woman in the room knows to give him a wide berth as he's either thought about it, or has actually been involved in domestic violence.
---
What is the classic replacement for Bongos? Looking around it doesn’t look like it’s being updated for the new client. What would you use instead?

I created [a spreadsheet (for mages)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AOaUrcqD2VACC3faoIEl0DJWhXCbyDtY8vtMjRkhmAI/edit#gid=0) to figure this out exactly. By marking the core spells for my spec (your mileage will vary) here is what I get:
---
164.71 Total Gold spend from levels 40-60  
---
53.31 Total Gold spend from levels 1-40  
---
209.32 Total Gold spend for all spells  
---
16.72 Total Gold spend from spells marked 'y' in the Buy column
---
Blizzard has a tendency to tell you to get fucked, and it's never going to happen, only to implement the change months or years later.
---
Ironforge &gt; Orgrimmar/ud combined...
---
They dropped off Naxx trash mobs and were tradable iirc
---
FWIW: I just focused on spells to level 40. I was trying to figure out the amount saved just getting to 40.
---
So true.. My OOT cartridge is literally saved with me in there after giving up as a kid...
---
I don't recall the playerbase requesting a complete stripping down of the stat system, removing talents, introducing rampant rng, and pruning classes to their most basic level.  When it comes to how classes play and gear / itemization, that is all on Blizz.
---
This is great! Where did you find the cost of the spells?
---
Jesus christ those times are not even bad case, they are 'afking after every pull, literally not hitting buttons half the time, and possibly being asleep on follow for the whole dungeon".
---
I think you are massively over estimating both how bad people are and how hard dungeons are.

Can we choose between circumsized and uncircumcised? Length, width, etc?

Thank you for enabling endless porn, easier delivery service and the possibility to see how kids are so I keep using condoms.

---
My argument is that most of the people on this subreddit have no interest in retail wow. So they arent going to be a customer for the base subscription let alone pets and mounts. Also who actually wastes their money on the lame pets, mounts toys that blizzard puts out. Mounts are usually a status symbol and people use the ones that are the hardest to collect which usually have the best looks anyway. As far as boosts they give you a free boost with every expansion so if most of these players are up to date with the game they should have most classes already close to max level.
---
And thats With dynamic spawn. Classic release is gonna be fucking nuts. Ill be surprised, as a troll shaman, if I can get to lvl 10 after 5 hours
---
Why are you single for real, then? A lot of single people are by choice or sheer indifference, but you make it sound like there's a much more serious hurdle.
---
Nice try Activision, we dont want that crap in here!
---
I was lucky, I rolled a Warrior as my first class and 13 years later I found out they’re the most OP class in WoW.
---
You didnt mention Trolls. So roll Troll
---
They’re just trying to justify being a thief because they don’t want to pay $15 a month for the real thing.
---
I wasn't intending to comment on Blizzard's behavior, just that argument in general when/how it is used.
---
Yea yea yea, i do what I want
---
First - thank you immensely for the detailed write up, I really appreciate it.
---
Second - holy shit I had no idea some dungeons would take that long! With my limited time to play it looks like I *won't* be knocking through a couple of runs an evening like I assumed I'd be able to, even with having the tank/healing roles already sorted. That's useful to know. 
---
Dungeons sound a lot more epic and much more of a time commitment in vanilla then when I used to play in wrath. I'm still keen to try them all (except maybe Uldaman) but I think I'll be putting them in the 'sometimes food' category rather than trying to level solely through them like my partner suggested. Thanks again for the great write up!
---
You're crazy, man. Retail and Vanilla/BC are two entirely different games.
---
Feral and feral hybrid Druid builds that are well played counter mages easier than even hunters. The limiting factor is that they are extremely poorly represented and a mage will rarely face one played that way. Most druid tend to pvp with their heal or hybrid heal spec and gear straight out of raiding.
---
No, Pokemon and Call of Duty are two entirely different games. Classic and Battle for Azeroth are very similar.
---
Blizzard could never decide if they wanted to let players minmax or not. The same people that gutted enchanting gave us reforging. Now with the super sterile progression system we have, I doubt we'll ever be able to again -- in retail.
---
Yea man, you're really gonna stick it to em!
---
Bend em over a barrel!
---
Easier said than done.
---
Since the only class can really tank all that well is Warrior (Druids do exist, but finding a Druid tank while levelling is like finding a unicorn since barely anyone plays druid) and a lot of people generally don't want to go through the slog of Warrior levelling, it's hard to just say "we need more tanks, you should really play a tank in Classic"
---
Yeah but then he has to be troll.
---
To me, TBC was WoW's golden age. Even if they released further Classic expansions after TBC (assuming they even get to TBC, that is), I'd stick with TBC and not go any further.
---
I've played private servers, but there's no PVE servers with a population more than a few hundred.
---
I really don't enjoy PVP servers, so I'm excited for Classic to play the game I love without the drama and the griefing that's so damn common on pservers.
---
It amazes me that I've never seen a duo rogue leveling group named Drizzt/Artemis.
---
I'm not trying to trash talk anyone here, I'm just stating my beliefs.
---
**If Blizzard would ever consider writing out new content for Classic+ / TBC+ / Wrath+, the way to do it that would receive the least criticism would be to play out TBC+ and Wrath+.**
---
Classic players are purists. They're mostly in it for the nostalgia. The 16 debuff cap in 40 player raids doesn't bother them. Having only one viable tank class doesn't bother them. Entire specs being invalid in PvP, PvE, or both for the entire release doesn't bother them. Bringing green-rarity resist gear to current content due to lack of available resist gear in dungeons and earlier raids or as buffs doesn't bother them.
---
These things and others are not defects or poor design to Classic players. They are the embodiment of the game as it was. They don't want a "better" Vanilla. The best Vanilla for them is Vanilla as it was, all of its quirks, flaws, and features included.
---
I do not get that same impression nearly as much from those hoping for TBC and Wrath. The friends I've spoken to are much more open to changes, especially in Wrath. Adding Naxxramas hard modes, re-tuning class rotations and talent trees, building out professions more, bringing back the Path of the Titans, bug and quality-of-life fixes, adding difficulty to dungeons / heroics, reworking the Argent Tournament. These are all ideas I've heard thrown around.
---
TL/DR: **Classic was the first. Those that enjoyed it found a way to love it for what it was. Those that enjoyed TBC and Wrath fundamentally embraced and enjoyed changes made to the Vanilla system, and in general should be more open to the idea of additions beyond what went into retail TBC and Wrath.**
---
Eh... This is great and all, but listening to the community is a big part of why the current game is in the bin. People have been shouting "listen to us!" for a decade but they never realised that the loudest majority were those who wanted less interaction, less buttons, less effort for reward. Remember that raid panel from the very first Blizzcon? They straight up made fun of players, they did not give a shit. WoW was at its peak when Blizzard just put their own vision and passion into the game without any other input. I'm not saying the community isn't important, but there's a point where a community can dictate way too much for their own good. Listening doesn't mean they always have to concede every decision just to placate the forums.
---
Its hillarious that the votes swung in opposite directions for us when we said essentially the same thing with different words lmfao.
---
enjoy classic bud.
---
Priest is the best healer.
---
Some classes have good specs that work in both PvP and the Raid environment.
---
I'm playing on an alliance guild and the one thing I kind of regret with that decision is not being able to play resto shaman. I played it in vanilla, I played it thru Legion when i quit.  
---
But it will be fun on a new character with a good new group of people. Can't wait.
---
Strange game. 
---
Only winning move is not to play.
---
r/wow has a leak
---
They make the best Rogue Dodgetanks Alliance-side, but nobody knows just how useful dodgetanks are yet so who knows. They also have the unique Arcane Priest spec, but that's projected to be pretty low-dps, especially with the new data on boss Arcane resistances.

the economy just doesn't make sense, it is financially beneficial to treat people like garbage, lie, kill off people, appeal to shallow emotions, be popular, andddd being efficient (probably the only good thing) Whereas it's not productive being honest, generous, helping others.
---
The fact that actors, casters, people who literally stream games, make substantially more money then the average person who might pick up garbage, or do construction, or do foresting is just illogical. Whenever a topic goes into what's financially beneficial makes me vomit in my mouth.

 "Things you CANNOT do: 1) No weapons, armor, or other wearables maybe be equipped at any time.  This includes hand weapons."

    I cannot have no weapons? So I can have weapons? I see what's going on here...

That didn't exist. Anything you found on the shop were either in vanilla or the vanilla game files. I bought a black panther mount from the shop...it was the same mount the guards rode around on in Darnassus.

I don’t mind running there. It’s just finding the group itself.

Having an automated process for finding a group is just 100x better than physically finding the group.

Like... it’s not even possible to find a random person to join your group after 1 person left half way through a dungeon.

There definitely was dynamic spawning in beta, just as there was dynamic spawning in Vanilla. Don't state your opinions as fact.

Yes dynamic spawning wasn't as severe as it was in later expansions or on pservers, but it definitely existed.
---
I mean... the forums are a cesspool now.     
---
If I was a developer I wouldn't want to look in there... same with Reddit since everyone seems to be up in arms about every single decision Blizzard makes.

Blizzard is clearly going to test WoW As A Service. First comes classic, then TBC, then you have a timeline of all time hits constantly refreshing all for $19+ a month, no other mmorpg can touch that.

Yeah but pve server :(

The one thing about wrath I liked is that I played a resto druid and was almost unkillable.  I remember one time messing around in stv I got jumped by 3 players.  I think it was a shadow priest a rogue and I can't remember the 3rd class.  I had them beating on me for about 5 minutes while I slowly walked my way back to base.  Could barely keep playing because I was laughing so hard.

No.  And thank god.  Invisible landmine deaths were the dumbest shit.

When are people going to realize that the current state of the game isnt because it's everything the players wanted, but that it's primarily the result of Blizzard trying to get more NEW players into the game. And also not everything that changed from Vanilla made the game worse. I'd argue most of it made the game better. There's just a few big core things Blizzard fucked up.
---
One time, my group was delayed for an hour cos our tank and healer decided to make out on the golem creation tables in the room right after Argelmach. The two of em didn't even know each other before the run began but I guess after killing dwarves together for 3 hours, sparks were flying. The rest of us decided to just wait by Argelmach's corpse for them to get done rather than go to the trouble of hearthing out to Ironforge to look for a new tank and healer..
---
Hi Skirvin. Nothing wrong with a little theorycraft before bed. 
---
Unless you're working on a Retadin. Many brave souls have been lost going down that rabbit hole.
---
Oohh, across the bridge in that barracks area right?
---
For sure, getting directions and having to figure out where to go, and look around to find what matches the description added a lot to the exploration element, its also a basic story telling element for an adventure, to be pointed in the direction of fortune or danger. When I last played WoW there wasn't any story at all, because as you said reading the quest text was just a waste of time. I hope retail learns to restore what it lost with lessons learned from classic, but also hope players appreciate classic, and not immediately jump to addons that negate the point.
---
Generally a higher % of horde chills at one place, org, than the alliance %, as they are in ironforge and stormwind, so they aren't as concentrated.
---
You could be right though, people that pick horde over alliance could like duelling more.
---
I think that’s exactly what he was saying...
---
Nost was the one that got popular, that's it. There were others, but nost got the "no XP bonus, no cash shop, vanilla private server" into the mainstream. That got blizzards attention, so they shut it down. Nost then became the martyr for classic wow.
---
Haha good idea
---
Yeah I'm hoping she becomes attached to it
---
My first and only pally was a blood elf. Not gonna do that again haha
---
 Just go into fury until 40, then respec to arms like most warriors usually do. Then just keep speccing DPS and respec into a proper tank at/near 60. 
---
Yeah, I think I´ll do that. Thanks for the response dude, you sure know a lot.
---
The modern gamer and social culture influences this more than anything else. Classic requires better guild cooperation however and you clearly see a more friendly atmosphere in general if you stick with doing things in guild. Pugs generally are fine. I had very few bad encounters and considered them one offs if things went bad and the cause was easy to notice (typically one person).
---
As with real life, your chances for fun is highly influenced by the crowd you choose to hand around with.
---
Well guess I'm the guy who was bored by leveling enhance.  Damage is so dependent on windfury procs.  Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes it does not proc till it's nearly dead.  Using shock means you'll be drinking a lot more.
---
In general I agree, cross-server battlegrounds definitely changed the playing field a lot, but back in those days, it was often a necessity... If you had an imbalanced server or just a dead one, forget getting a queue at all... Even for Deathwing-US which was a high pop server at the time and mostly balanced (think it was like 60-40 horde), getting into battlegrounds still felt amazingly sluggish.
---
I think Battlegroups were a good compromise for a hard problem... At first I hated not knowing most people, but I actually did in fact become familiar with a lot of people in my battlegroup (BG9 Nightfall for Deathwing) and it presented an interesting means of communicating outside my normal ecosystem even if I could only ever meet them there -- it was kinda like making friends with a foreigner and only seeing them occasionally when you happened to be in the same place.
---
The way it is now where it's literally a hodgepodge of everyone, there isn't ANY consistency anymore. No chance for meeting someone twice...
---
Sure it's 6 feet long, but it's a *feminine* penis!
---
I'm a naked Undead but I identify as a Troll, is that ok
---
People crying about it just makes it more like...
---
oh, everything
---
Ayyyy
---
IF was the main alliance city in vanilla wow
---
&gt; Classic and Battle for Azeroth are very similar.
---
In what way are they similar besides aesthetic?
---
BFA questing/leveling is linear. Classic is not.
---
BFA has very little community and is basically a multiplayer simulator in the open world. Classic has discrete communities.
---
Classic dungeons require use of coordination and CC every pull. Threat is a legitimate challenge to build and maintain as a tank. Mana isn't just a time constraint, it's a resource you have to manage. None of that is true for BFA.
---
The rewards in Classic are earned over large expanses of time and usually require a significant time investment to be completed while they are top of the line. BFA, well, does not.
---
Retail is much closer to a multiplayer action game at this point. There's a primary stat and 4 secondary stats to manage. Gear worn while PvPing is functionally the same as PvEing.
---
Endgame raiding is just as much about roster management as it is actually learning the relatively simple mechanics. BFAs raid mechanics are exponentially more complex.
---
They're really not that similar besides the fact that you level by clicking on NPCs with a "!" and turn into a "?" when complete and the aesthetics.
---
I think if there's a level squish, it will be explicitly just scaling everything down. So, say the old level 60 (vanilla content cap) is equivalent to level 30 post-level squish. All level 60 characters just get their level changed to 30 instead.
---
Daoc did the same with 3 factions (realms, Hibernia, Albion and Midgard) The population was split between the 3 more or less equally, no realm drop below 25% or was above 40%
---
Ironforge gates....
---
3 button whackamole is an improvement over 1 button drinking bird
---
Where do you see literally any of that

---
Fck...ill definately do that and drop out unexpectedly if i lack time.
---
No, both were available at launch. Only RP-PvP was not available at launch.
---
I think I ran BRD dozens of times but only did 1 "full run".  Unless somebody needed something on the right, we made straight for the doors on the left.
---
I don't think they will either, but it would be hilarious if the classic server names were Nostalrius, Kronos, Light's Hope etc.
---
You can determine all that without a realm list.
---
&gt; Hey, do we want to roll Pacific, Central, or Eastern?
---
Eastern!
---
&gt; Do we want to roll PVP, PVE, or RP?
---
PVP!
---
Okay, there will be ONE server that matches that.
---
Done.
---
Warlock detect invisibility work?
---
It was more about fast access to Blackrock Mountain for MC/BWL.
---
There were high population servers at low population servers of every kind, the people on the low population servers were usually pretty quick to compensate with having a tighter knit community.
---
Classic will be bigger than fortnite. Asmon is already bigger than Ninja and will be bigger than Tfue after Classic. Some for Soda.
---
that seems like a lot of servers tbh but math wise it makes sense, I could see them launching with less servers until server queues become an issue then opening more up as needed
---
I don't think it will happen but it would be hilarious if the Classic servers were all named after different private servers.
---
You've settled it for me I'm going to make a Melee hunter. I'm going to raid and get my guilds first Thunderfury.
---
&gt; No it isn't, you have lots of choices.
---
Lots of choices? You mean choosing between 5 zones and their linear paths to follow? Or do you mean being offered linear side-quest chains within the 5 zones and their linear quests? 
---
BFA questing/leveling is 100% linear if you're good at it.
---
&gt; Sure it does.
---
What an argument.
---
&gt; No they don't.
---
Oh, look, another shitty argument.
---
&gt; There are other challenges that end up having the same effect.
---
And a third one. My turn.
---
&gt; BFA and Classic share 99.99% of the same DNA.
---
No they don't.
---
&gt; if you've played one, you're familiar enough with the other.
---
No you aren't.
---
&gt; That's not true across genres.
---
I didn't say they're different genres. I said BFA is "more of a". Learn how to read. Stop LARPing like you're going to participate in a discussion just so you can functionally spam "I disagree" with zero substance. It's a waste of everyone's time.
---
Hope someone looted the engineering pattern there at least.
---
People usually think highly of Mages when they are good at playing a maid
---
typically guilds will throw funnel t2 on one hunter, other hunters in the guild will be using whatever else in the meantime.
---
Also, you don't always get what you want from raids.  If this is an upgrade for a hunter, they'll roll on it.
---
Yknow, the first time I read his comment I also read 'phase 3' but he never actually says it. Weird
---
Hm, if you add a Dragonbreath Chili and an Elixer of Greater Firepower, the dps gain is even greater. Can you add fire or burning into your naming?
---
People hated jail break.  Of all the times I ran BRD, I only did jail break a couple of times.  Same goes for the ring of the law sequence.
---
Even legion was far too much grind for the sake of grind for my taste.
---
Artifact power and by extension azerite power are the worst systems ever implemented in the game since they're numbers literally for the sake of numbers. Retail has been so metrics and "engagement" focused for so long i felt more like a lab rat than actually playing a game.
---
I mean yeah, classic is still grindy as fuck, but at the end of the day you had *fun* doing those grinds with other people. It at least had the decency to hide the experimentation equipment you were undergoing behind the curtain and be a fun game first like a civilized skinner box. Rather than just expecting players to want to see numbers go up just for the sake of it.
---
When those numbers have no meaning, and there's nobody to even share them with in the first place, it's too easy to see behind the curtain for what the game truly is nowadays.
---
Classic grinds feel super good to finish up. Like you actually *achieved* something. Current retail grinds invoke a feeling of "thank god its over" and you feel like a circus animal jumping through arbitrary hoops to get the carrot at the end of the rat infested tunnel. That's is the biggest difference for me in pre-wotlk versus post cata game design for me.
---
Yes. There's just not enough room outside IF and SW isn't a popular hangout. All horde characters hang out in Org and it's a far better and bigger area for duelling, and your average horde player probably is more interested in pvp.
---
Not sure how you got that i think its a bad thing.
---
Kommer ta mitt community med till denna server, vi är rätt många som kommer lira :) Alltid roligare med mer svenskar!.
---
I've done it a good handful of times, I LVOE the instance. To be fair, they mostly family/guild runs with people that liked to do long, stupid shit as well.
---
The trick is escalating it from the forums to the devs
---
Thanks for the reply,
---
Was one of the orders I tought... But guess it's not woth to delay the 5 points in oportunity to get that CB earlier right?
---
With your order at lvl 24 with the remorseless procd I will have a good chance to start with a crit ambush and them I just Gouge, Backstab (good chance to crit as well), kidney and another backstab. Sounds good or do you recommend some other rotation?
---
For me it was the opposite I was on PvE and thought PVP would be way better so I jumped at rolling on RP PVP when it first came out and ended up really regretting it. Turns out I like PvP sometimes, but not all the time. It's definitely something I will have an alt for, but my main will be PvE.
---
I know man. I always laugh at these people who are so hateful of blizzard when they are giving them exactly what they want. It’s like a kid snatching a gift from their mother and I stead of saying “thank you” they’re saying “it’s about time.”
---
Why go pve?
---
Ew. Purple?
---
I’m not even trying to argue with anyone. You can agree or disagree. Your opinion doesn’t effect mine in any way.
---
I SHOULD NOT HAVE TRIED THIS. I got stuck but used my brain and figured a way out and i thought it was absolutely hilarious. Party leader said night elfs cant do it.... i said watch me
---
(this is the quickest walk to sm from alterac for those who dont know)
---
just wanted to share cuz i had the largest grin on my face from something so dumb
---
affect*
---
Plot twist. Blizz made bfa borrible on purpose to push wow wish a secret "no advertising" tactic. I guess 3 million subs. Top kek
---
Playing through vanilla recently and I found that arms is probably the quickest, but imo fury is the most fun leveling experience
---
and again you keep thinking people are chosing servers based off of region, most people do not care about region. And i have absolutely no idea why you assume there will only be one server for each region, I promise you there will be more than one US-west Pvp server lol
---
Spoken like someone who doesn't have kids.
---
TBC Smite Priest
---
they always have thats how the game got to where it is now
---
Paladins are used to heal the tank because tanks always need a heal. A big part of Mana management for a priest involves cancel casting sniped heals to abuse the 5 second rule. Since tanks are always taking damage it's better for a paladin to spam heal them.
---
I 2nd this 1000%
---
in this sub you see some fences against classic tbc, hope it doesnt grow
---
What monetization does. It assigns a dollar value to accomplishing certain things in the game, and for many people they feel like that devalues the time effort they put in to accomplish thing those same exact things.
---
At the same time, not everyone feels that sense of devaluing.
---
&gt; essential skills 
---
\*Cries in Druid\*
---
So for half of the life of vanilla, feral was totally viable and no one bothered to figure it out...
---
I feel like you just spent a LOT of time proving MY point.
---
Hey warp, sweet list thanks for all the effort!
---
Was wondering if you could answer me a question. Lets say i combine intercept with hamstring, and use that as a double tap macro.
---
Is there any way to see Intercept's cooldown?
---
(As you would normally when you have the ability in your actionbar)
---
(I have only worked with macros in a 1.12 client so i have no idea what the limitations are right now)
---
I played a hunter and was my guild's top dps on almost every fight. We were also #1 Alliance and we fought for server 1st kills with the horde counterpart. We had some pretty good rogues and locks too.
---
Just saying that you could definitely play something else and do just fine.
---
over on the bigger servers but not nearly as bad as vanilla
---
bfa and legion had relatively smooth launches save some big servers, the thing for classic is that it truly can be unpredictable
---
You get disarm trap at 60. Theres no reason to have it before then. Its not “never get these abilities” its “ some of these abilities aren’t worth the money low level so don’t bother buying most of them and a few past rank one until 60”.  Your wasting mount money on a slice and dice rank that only adds a few seconds to the rank when you should be killing stuff fast enough for that not to matter. You’re basically throwing money down the drain on skills you won’t use till 60. I don’t even train disarm trap until I’m about to start bwl.
---
Think they hinted at it, said something the trend like if enough people want it who knows what will happen in other words, if classic makes us filthy rich daddy activision will grant us TBC.
---
it's barely worth half a shit in 1.12 lol.
---
Very true
---
I want to eliminate the wasted time when I'm the victim of world PvP.
---
MTX. Thats where a massive chunk of the money comes from.
---
Tokens, mounts, pets and account services.
---
Max leveled a warrior, realized I hated it, rerolled hunter. It’s funny because if it weren’t for the fact there are going to be WAAAAY too many warriors, I’d probably trying rolling one again.
---
May I ask why druid with rogue? I understand rogue but not druid. Is druid good at pvp?
---
Bro I'm right there wit you. The world is fucked - but that's a conversation for a different sub at a different time.
---
This is a heavily controversial opinion but - blame the consumer. It isn't the streamer's fault that viewers shill and spend insane amounts of money on what is essentially a virtual friend. It isn't Brad Pitt's fault that he makes 7 million dollars in a single film. Film, TV, and social media are consumed by media gluttons who would rather sit in front of their television and have their opinions decided for them. 
---
People need to educate themselves, quit being so lazy, and learn how they can make a difference. It's sad. I feel like smart people are suppressed by idiots who refuse to listen, refuse to change, and refused to find credible sources for their opinions other than Facebook. 
---
Sorry for this tangent but it's something I feel strongly about.
---
It's not illogical at all. Putting eyeballs on screens has incredible value, and the jobs you just listed are all specialized at doing just that. Actors make money because movies and TV shows make money. It would be illogical *not* to pay an actor an amount of money comparable to the value they bring to a product. Economy is many things, but "illogical" is almost never one of them.
---
Dud, we used to Server 1st so much of this content with 35 people, 5 smoking week, 10 drunk off their ass and the rest having no idea how to play their class even close to optimally.
---
It was not designed for perfect information. It wasn’t designed for the level of spreadsheet data driven calculations that the community has decided should the norm for raiding.
---
Don’t stand in the shit, When you’re the bomb go to the wall, and learn what LOS is. Got it? Know that and you can probably autoattack with a stick and make a raid team.
---
bfa also has shown that they also can listen with the recent changes, blizzard has a big issue of being stubborn though
---
It sounds like people who badmouth the idea of burning Crusade because they keep confusing their feelings for burning Crusade with how they feel about battle for Azeroth and the whole 15-year process. People forget what they really thought about burning Crusade back in the day
---
Also, you really cannot lump burning Crusade and wrath together like that, especially when they have many differences. But again, none of us are accurate judges of how we felt back then versus now.
---
Likewise, people who get angry over the idea of burning Crusade coming next, many times, that is just misplaced frustration at knowing that the time they invest in classic and those characters now, 15 years from now there's a strong possibility those characters will be right back at Battle for Azeroth. And that depresses them
---
Ah yes. I think that we agree then.
---
Paladins cancel too.  no pt in just letting heals land and just completely overheal for no reason.
---
&gt; I'm not sure what drives that mentality
---
After believing they were the good guys, the Alliance was crushed when they learned that they are actually the villains.
---
You are going to see so many people think Warrior or Mage or Priest then get to about level 15 and swap to Hunter. It was a bitch to level those three classes. They were not designed for solo leveling.
---
To be fair, nowadays blizzard gets so much disparate feedback from so many people that they're definitely better off not taking their advice
---
7th grade summer my mom was the manager of our local swim pool so hence I lived at the swim pool all summer. There was this lifeguard who was the coolest dude I knew and he would always talk about video games with me. So one day he brings wow to work with him and tells me to ask my mom if I can download it. (I think my mom had a 01 HP and it took like 18 hours to download) from there I would play all night and wake up and go to the pool. I leveled a troll shaman and was probably the worst player on the realm (bloodscalp) fun times!
---
Lvld a shaman to 60 back in 2005.
---
One thing i can tell you is that shamans are far from boring.
---
As soon as you get WF its so much fun, youll suprise yourself with what your capable of sometimes. Also very RNG cus of procs so thatll help with the excitement factor!
---
Saving 10g is super impactful for your lvl 40 mount
---
Nope. No time to waste on professions. Plenty of time to do that when I’m 60 and most of the server is still leveling.
---
Alliance rogues should avoid training vanish.
---
I know nothing about PCs so have no idea to judge whether my laptop will run Classic well or not. It currently runs Lightshope private server perfectly on full graphics, will it run Classic on low? :l
---
No they won't lose money. Just the opposite, they will have even more money to put towards new expansions from what they make on people returning just for classic.
---
Is it in anyway related to limewire?
---
But, it's so cheap there's no reason not to just pick it up asap and forget about it. It's one gold. I can kill like, 20 hyenas and be done with it.
---
Back before players got burned out and directed their burnout frustration at blizzard in the form of dissatisfaction.
---
I remember asking for classic back in Wrath and Cata. So for me its been way over 7 years.
---
I'm bad enough that I actually like mechanics that rely on a bit of RNG.
---
I'm making the switch to PvE in classic.
---
Gonna miss it but I need more control over my limited playing time.
---
First aide spec warrior.
---
What exactly do you get out of this? You're adding nothing and just popping off disagreeable one liners.. The only possible way this isn't sad is if you're on the spectrum.

I'm not well versed in pserver history, mainly because I only heard about pservers because of Nostalrius. I had no idea such things existed. I can't be the only one. They managed to host and promote a gigantic Vanilla pserver, props to them.
---
Upvotes, obviously. Though I doubt many people are following me trashing you, it's clear that our audience agrees with me and disagrees with you.
---
Same here, I don't have the time to invest like I used to.
---
TBC and early cataclysm heroics were the pinnacle of 5-man content to me.
---
Hopefully Curse will add them to their client, installing addons through Curse is by far the simplest and easiest method.
---
My first character was a nelf Rogue because the night elf description said they were better at stealth.
---
Those people are still around.
---
Bring up classic on retail and you'll still get shit on.
---
Lmfao please describe the ways in which you're "trashing" me.
---
Oh man I remember that desktop wallpaper
---
I would argue that a skilled Resto shaman excels in pvp
---
Right, and dps bitch about things like that, and I am just like.... 
---
&gt;Then be a tank man?  
---
&gt;Show us up!  
---
&gt;Enjoy all the perks and prove to the world how superior your ethics are!  
---
&gt;I would enjoy the chance to play a disposable class and bitch about how you run your groups. 
---
But usually they just ignored me and didn't do anything but keep whining.
---
[strong disagree](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cijx1d/how_long_did_raids_take/ev8fr3n/)
---
Paladins actually level up pretty quickly.
---
The Argent Dawn are a lot of ex Silver Hand.
---
To shadowpriest in Black Temple.
---
 Server transfer
---
Explain "rage capped"
---
trash - *verb* - to throw away, vandalize, destroy, attack, assault, spoil, ruin
---
Yep, that pretty much sums it up.
---
Yes, the Wildhammer Dwarves are shamanistic
---
Okay let me rephrase myself. 
---
No good players do full clears tho
---
First character was a nelf Rogue. Played for about 5 hours then deleted him to make a Mage, didn't realize that you could have multiple characters at the time.
---
It’s the rarest role across pretty much all games. Even in FFXIV, where the dungeons are all straight corridors, 95% of all boss attacks are telegraphed, and holding threat is trivial (tank stance, which you get at level 10, has no damage penalty and a 10x threat multiplier), tanks are always in demand.
---
People are afraid of having to be the “leader” or the most visible/responsible member of the group. It even has a name: tanxiety.
---
I'm familiar with the word. Describe your inputs to this exchange that you feel qualify for the descriptor "trashing" me.
---
You need an active sub to play, not to download.
---
Would be interested to see the other classes and their associated costs.
---
The only thing keeping you from playing Classic is the calendar saying it's not the 27th yet.
---
Poggers! But f the horde :)
---
We need an Azeroth theme park.
---
Ive been waiting for classic since the day they anounsed burning crusade, so get on my level =D
---
I'll probably use some variation of this build. Sweeping strikes is super underrated for tanking.
---
Level 2
---
I main balance in live, and would like to play it in classic. I wasn't there in vanilla, so I don't know, but is boomkin as bad as people say it is in raiding? Or is it just bad on the top end side of things?
---
A hunter stealthing as their cat pet was the coolest thing to me
---
Or because they know that gearing a tank is irrelevant unless they plan on actually raiding as the main tank. Until naxx most fights are still just mt ot, so the other dozen warriors don't wanna go tank or use loot rolls on tank gear.
---
No there were pvp,pve,rp servers at launch.
---
Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne
---
I remember outleveling my friends as a paladin by a mile, free mount and godly self healing FTW!
---
Most of vanilla was pre patch 1.9
---
Sorry, but if your reading comprehension isn't good enough to scroll up and know it yourself, then my summary isn't going to do you any good.
---
2% of us are going to steamroll.
---
The other 98% are still going to have immense amounts of fun and entertainment.
---
Doubtful. They're testing a global hardware rollout. The best way to do that is put everyone in the same region on the same server. I doubt there will even be a choice of PVP versus PVE in the Stress Test.
---
Ive been playing blizzard games since the lost vikings and rock n roll racing on megadrive. Family got a 2nd hand pc that had wc2 installed on it. Been warcraft obsessed ever since, so the transition to wow was not only natural but also mind blowing.
---
FT is linear in its damage application (However it scales a bit with spell/fire damage thus if you have this faster = better). Otherwise, stated faster to slower weapons get no benefit other than coefficient. By the time you have some SP (enough to matter) WF is &gt; the FT anyway.
---
The only case which this is not true is with hybrid builds where you are stacking caster stats.
---
What does occur is Rockbiter scales with slower weapons a lot.
---
I’ve been saying the words “i miss vanilla” since 2008.  Thanks nost. We owe you one.
---
Recruit. Make a choice. Pay the respec. See above. 
---
The more you water the shit down the worse it gets. Why not make it triple spec right away, in case you want a PvP spec too.
---
I don't really like theme parks, but I would definitely go to that
---
Didn't name him thex? SMH
---
Funny that with all your exp you are still level 1.  I have played more then most and would never claim more then someone i don't know.  I let my knowledge prove itself.  With multiple people telling you that you are clueless just stop with the nonsense.
---
I think the "never goed away" crowd a really just fearmongering...
---
Truth be told, all we know is layering will be gone before phase 2. When exactly is up for grabs. 1 week? 2 weeks? A day before phase 2? Could be anytime really. Only time will tell.
---
You don't see it, do you?
---
1st case. 
---
The coefficient is unaffected by base damage or weapon speed.
---
You don't have a brain, do you?
---
That sounds like an amazing experience! I recently met Jeff Kaplan at an Overwatch related event, but got to talk to him about his work in WoW Vanilla and BC and how much we all LOVE Molten Core raid (which wouldn't be in the game if it weren't for his blessed soul).

I'm the one with the upvotes here. How's your score doing? Probably negative.

I rolled Troll Hunter at the recommendation of my friend. Switch to the Alliance because my 10 year old self couldn’t handle playing as Horde. The first time decided I wanted to reroll Paladin since they got their mount for free. Didn’t get too far. Wanted to try a Gnome Rogue. This began my indecision that still goes onto this day.

---
3. Yell blood and thunder as I fight
---
4. Get home
---
5. Start up Classic
---
Vanilla is dead, long live Classic!
---
Go look at the Blue Post from three days ago, where did they call it a stress test?
---
I do! I spent way too much time thinking about it. It was 1g.
---
Too ignorant for me gl kid.
---
People should live their life by that philosophy
---
I think I’d play BC forever. Fresh server, play for a year or two, take a break, repeat.
---
OH SHIT I JUST GOT **TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASHED**
---
True, i feel the same way. Only the world bosses really form any sense of challenge and even those are pretty easy if you pay a little attention... The only thing i've really died to are other players in war mode, and a dungeon wipe here or there because the healer or tank idn't doing their jobs. (i often seem to pull aggro as a frost mage... I have a tank alt, it's so easy to hold aggro in retail, how the fuck are yoy letting that mob even set 3 steps toward me let alone attack me once...)
---
&gt; We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test – 20:00 CEST to 22:00 CEST, as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch.
---
They may not have used the word, but the implication is clear.
---
Thorns and maybe roots are the only balance skill you need post 10. You can probably get away with leaving healing touch at 4, rejuv at 3 and only max regrowth. Then it's just feral skills but I'd only worry about a few of the cat skills.
---
Oh yeah for sure, preferrably I'll be aiming at farming the more hard to get/rarer materials as much as I can before I switch my mining to engineering.
---
Read my post again, where did I say the word stress? And besides:
---
It 100% does work. If you’re having trouble disengaging from combat, remember to put the pet on passive before you try it. If not, they can put you back in combat right after you feign.
---
You need to be good and know how to counter,! Free action potion ? IB! Hunters? Just blink into deadzone and cast your insta spells and nova the tard. Getting dispelled? Cast your buffs again. Mana potions and mana gem for mana ofc.
---
Im going to run dungeons with my guild and when im doing pug dungeons im the healer and i will be sure to make some tank friends, you can always find dps.
---
Yeah I think this is the best way to contribute damage and also heal. Imp. Wand with something like a Gravestone Scepter is actually some pretty great damage for no mana investment and will help out a decent bit in dungeons and whatnot.
---
Most of us are so much better off today than when retail vanilla was released.
---
I've been playing private servers the last 5 years. If Blizzard provided the same service with stable servers and some staff, no doubt that I'd much rather pay for that than playing for free on a pserver.
---
Downvote me all you want, but they used clear word choice of “Global Pre-Release Test”, after using “Stress Test” for the first three tests.
---
Enjoy, dad!
---
Joyland is not Azeroth, it's a fake illegal mashup of lots of different intellectual properties including Transformers, DC Comics, and Marvel.
---
faps arent free
---
Wow, one of the books that still really resonates with me is Lord of the Clans, it's the reason I played a shaman and it was just an epic adventure reading Thrall go from slave to war chief. That'd be a baller fucking memory to have.
---
Warlock -&gt; Priest -&gt; Warlock
---
As far as I know all instant cast don't reset swing timer.
---
I'm in the awkward working hours boat too, also looking to play a shadow or disc priest, planning on doing ZG, MC if I find time and AQ20. Don't want to commit too much to the game but want to try and experience as much as a non hardcore player can!!
---
True, we’ll know one of those days!
---
You should posted this on the main WoW subreddit. People would have been more appreciative over there.
---
Well if that's proof, then [this](https://imgur.com/GKbA5F1) is too.
---
Just make a pit stop In Korea
---
Real talk. The past is dead. Enjoy the present. Dude is in vacation.
---
This time around is going to be a lot different than 2004.
---
I assume there will be more people that dont understand it, but vanilla veterans will. And they are the ones I would prefer to group with anyway
---
Do not let blizzard know but i would drop $500 to play. I wish they would have offered a classic wow collectors edition.
---
Ah, so you’re a troll.
---
Yes, and actually you made me realize a bug in my Intercept+Hamstring cast sequence macro. The showtooltip command does display the cooldown. It works properly in the first version, however in the castsequence version, that showtooltip will display Hamstring until the sequence resets. It will show Intercept's cooldown if you hold ctrl. If you wanted to know Intercept's cooldown at all times, you'd use:
---
showtooltip [mod:ctrl][stance:3] Intercept
---
This will display the cooldown if you are either holding ctrl or are in Berserker Stance. You'd want to do the same thing for Charge in that macro.
---
Vanilla veterans will have no problem using /world as shown with every Private Server and the Classic Beta.
---
Because they have us what we asked for? Of course they're gonna want to make money from it. That's what a good business does. How can you be mad at them for that?
---
I actually considered that haha, defiently worths the money.  Plus I can learn a lot from their Korean gaming skills.
---
Yep. Even had a sleep study done.
---
Depending on who's in the guild.  Come phase 2, pick up a pair of aged core leather gloves or mugger's belt and just go Dagger Fury if you don't want to get edgemasters.  Rogues already get +5 weapon skill through talents.  That +5 to +8 soft cap is a difference, but not as much of a difference as the +0 to +5.  But I'd just maybe figure out what the rogues are doing.  It's also a phase 2 drop, so you'll pretty much want to get edgemasters anyway for phase 1.
---
If you have a ton of human rogues and a ton of human warriors. There's going to be a lot of waiting for swords.  
---
Human warriors can use maces as well in a pinch with their racial, so it's not all swords.  You can get Kazzak with Ironfoe (yeah if you're lucky on the drop) for phase2, kazzak/spineshatter BWL, sand polished hammer and Qiraji War Hammer in AQ, and Naxx has Castigator and Servo Arm.
---
And so it begins. . . the first paladin power ranger raid set.
---
Go go Pally Rangers.
---
Take care, son!

When you have more rage then you can spend.
---
If you are using your abilities on every GCD and you still have spare rage to dump using Heroic Strike, you will want the fastest weapon possible because HS is tied to weapon speed and is off the GCD
---
holy shit
---
Nothing you do in a game will compare to real life experiances so please dont go home just for classic enjoy your travels around a forein country as azeroth isnt going any where
---
Accepted a quest from Ilthalaine
---
Not sure about that. Population will be much higher than pservers. Might as well just go with trade chat?
---
No way that could go wrong... 'link Group score only 3000+ gets invite'
---
Is there any in diablo 3?
---
/u/Mxdarin lol deleted
---
Going by Nost then elysium which both ran a PvP and PvE server they sat around 1/3rd the pop of the PvP server. Obviously not an exact representation but feel it will be a somewhat similar overall ratio .
---
lmao!
---
When i played back in 2008 i mained a gnome mage. I kind of want to roll horde this time just to see what the other side is like.
---
You'll rarely want to enchant gear that isn't soulbound anyway, so it's not much of an issue
---
being level 60 on horde and using eye of the beast to terrorize red ridge is a true classic
---
I played tbc-cata but I feel like I’m coming in a new player
---
Link to that wallpaper pls?
---
Well shit, forget Classic then... Retail WoW here I come!
---
Ez-thro Dynamite?
---
As a paladin I would buy these by the stack for ranged pulls. Guessing there isnt much profit?
---
Trying to get on the train but ive just been taken back by surrealism and how dream like this seems to be.
---
wow, I'd completely forgotten about reforging.
---
I leveled during the first few months. It was basically just constant auto attack. It was so damn mindless.
---
8-27-19!!!
---
A swing timer reset is a bad thing. Say a tauren warrior has a 3.0 speed weapon. If he swings (3.0 till next aa) then mortal strikes, then warstomps after the gcd, the next swing is now 3.0 seconds after the warstomp rather than from the first swing.
---
Completing the Mor'Ladim quest chain in Duskwood and wielding Archerus. That dam elite killed me so many times, I was thrilled to get revenge and and wield his weapon 'Archerus'.
---
Mages are extremely strong with a lot of tools to help them win fights.  They have a high skill cap so good players tend to have their way with you.  They do have bad match ups for sure depending on spec and class.  But I think the thing that makes mage frustrating to fight is that they have the ability to just simply run away if a fight isn't going their way in a lot of situations.
---
I scraped them off of a server (lots of RegEx expressions to clean it up)
---
Reminds me of the old communist parties in the US which were like 40% government operatives
---
You probably don't want to doxx yourself, Mr. Michael E. Wood.
---
&gt;Second, I'm not talking about which classes people are playing, but such roles they selected as their main roles.
---
In dungeons you can do any role as long as you have the gear and aren't really under leveled.
---
Tauren warrior!
---
This thread happened, because someone picked the FotM class, joined an instant-60 server and didb't immediately own, having no clue how to play it.
---
Definitely has to be the class or pservers being wonky....
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for!
---
Found it:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage/Abilities](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage/Abilities)
---
Thanks for the info and the tips. 
---
I think the main problem I'm having is in BGs. You don't always have your IB or Cold Snap cooldowns ready to go all the time. And you can't poly and play the waiting game when there is an entire BG attacking you at the same time. I rarely find myself getting 1v1 opportunities in a BG, but I see a lot of team fights where a lot of my 1v1/duel strengths feel obsolete.
---
VS Warlocks, it really does feel impossible. SPriests seem completely overpowered in Vanilla, I can barely dmg them it seems, even if I blow all cooldowns. I play alliance, so it feels like the enemy teams always a ton of SPriests, Warlocks, and Shamans.
---
thinking in doing a warrior, started playing warrior on WOD, and played till legion, never touched BFA, liked warrior so much, but I don't know if I'll like it on classic, what do you guys think?
---
I'd pay extra lol
---
High skill cap lol, mage is super easy, the damage of instant spells is so high you don‘t even need to cast. Mage has no counter and many default wins.
---
I started with a belf pally in late BC as a stupid 13 YO 
---
Didn’t make it past 20 
---
Rerolled alli female shammy 
---
Randomly decided to delete shammy bc it was female and couldn’t connect to it. Plus hated alli races too much by wrath 
---
Went and played opening of this server called Borean Tundra 
---
Rolled an orc warrior and smacked this Tauren hunter in a duel before razor hill around lvl 7. 
---
Will never forget him talking shit about how his warrior would destroy me. 
---
Ended up leveling to 20 in 2 days of no lifing (this was summer) went on to discover the religion of the Arms warrior. 
---
First max lvl toon was warr, only toon was warr. 
---
The path of the warrior is a way of life once found you can’t quit.
---
Nice try Blizzard.
---
Are you Welsh?
---
Imagine hiding behind a troll account on Reddit lmao.

Thank you! I bet there's some decent free ones

Swiftpoint Z. You can assign actions to mouse movement, tilting the mouse, pivot. You can even have multiple g-shift  buttons  which opens up for more actions to bind. It has onboard memory to store as many profiles it can hold and software does not need to be running and you can take the mouse any where. I have 12 different games profiles with sub-profiles.
---
I like the button placement , especially the under the knuckles. No need to stretch your fingers to the sides for the extra buttons. They are all easily accessible by just the index and middle finger. The mouse cost a little more than normal gaming mouse but it can be had for much cheaper if you look for sales.

Orc rogue.... Bloodfury and stun resist shits on WOTF
---
What he said
---
I prefer the banana armor to the dress with the mask myself
---
If u say that a class is super easy, you're probably playing it wrong to start with
---
&gt;from what i have figured out, rogue is optimal. i mostly just looked for what class has the best passives that dont require a weapon and with proper talents rogue gets:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;2% bonus damage to humanoid, giant, dragonkin and beast. 5% crit rate. 5% dodge. 5% parry. 2% lower chance to get critted on by mele and ranged. 4% reduced chance to be hit by ranged and spells. +10% attack power
---
What bout layering?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Cross server bgs weren't that bad when it was battlegroups. You'd still see the common PvP players. Maybe not quite as often but you still had a community.
---
Haha no cigar for you @jefframclassic :p
---
I remember when lfd first came out I leveled a paladin tank and dragged a group through that entire instance. I established this up front, the healer and 1 dps were down, the other 2 were not.
---
Over the next 2 hours me and that healer went through about 15 different dps before we finally cleared the full instance and all the quests (the dps who was down for a full clear unfortunately had to drop out eventually). Had him on my friends list for a while after that, we had spent the instance chatting about the state of the game and other shit. Good times
---
Balance has nothing to do with skillcap.  A character can be very hard to play at the highest level and still be shit.  A mage is hard to play at the highest level and good.  If you don't think a mage is hard at the highest level you don't know what high level play is.
---
I’ve been asking for classic since I was a little zygote in my mother’s womb
---
The community has asked for better balance. They still are. Perfect balance is when all the classes are identical. Less complexity is easier balancing.
---
The community has also complained about trash items that they looted, so that was removed. No more fun items except for toys.
---
Changing talents was because the community complained about cooky cutter builds. They realized that with the old system with flat damage upgrades there would always be cooky cutter builds. So they removed and simplified them.
---
Sure the community might not have come up with every single idea directly. But most of those changes were thought of because of community feedback.
---
No talents for this challenge, though.
---
i got my hunter to 40 but had no gold for a mount. rolled a rogue specifically to make money (must've really been intrigued by lockboxes) and took him to full tier 2 before quitting
---
and i'm gonna roll a rogue again because if it ain't broke
---
Is enchanting good to level? Im going druid and was thinking of trying it out
---
IIrc , dodgykebaab got banned on a private server for buying gold.
---
Cause it’s fun to hit things with swords. I’d be a paladin if they had crusader strike but here we are.
---
"The Naked Troll *Punching* Guild"
---
1.) Shaman can do more for your warrior woman than just keep her alive.
---
More importantly, monitor her feelings.  If you aren't legitimately having a fun relaxed time it will be almost impossible for her not to feel pressured with you hanging around, always looking for the next quest/level/dungeon.
---
The challenge clearly states no talents.
---
That's a solid average he posted. Within an hr of my time in beta. Keep in mind it's easy to be behind this time table easily. Beating it isn't terribly hard either. 
---
I would recommend enjoying the climb. Don't worry about time played so much or 1-60 is gonna be miserable.
---
I met him on my first day of work. He wandered into my on-boarding class and came up for an impromptu Q &amp; A. He just seemed like such a nice guy, it never felt like he was a corporate officer for a company that size. I was really sad to see him go but he totally deserves some family time.
---
Friend of mine remebers being being in his fathers left ball, telling his possible brothers and sisters about how ie is hyped about those sweet sweet classic servers
---
Got a gnome mage to level 6, went to Ironforge, took the tram to stormwind, got lost and couldn’t figure out how to get back. So the only solution was to reroll to a rogue for some reason
---
I always hated melee but for some reason always enjoyed playing my friends warrior during vanilla
---
dang hope things get better
---
Just hope disney buys out activision blizzard.
---
Uhhhh that's a ways off
---
Read the edits 4head
---
read the edits 4head
---
I've lvled it from 1-60 and I'd say its one of the more fun classes to lvl since u can be so diverse and have a massive toolkit. And for 60 pvp (damage wise that is) it's mostly auto hits and shock casts, but if u get a good 2h u will shit on ppl with windfury procs.
---
Druids are on both factions and paladins are only alliance. You need to cut the druid number in half to get an appropriate comparison for being alliance side.
---
I think the large consensus is that they told the wrong story. Most people agree that a Warcraft III movie would have done much better.
---
First char mage. Lvled it up to like 17. Then rerolled rogue "until i could decide what to play".
---
Played that rogue until tbc.
---
Yeah and you could grenade escape attack basically getting free windfury otherwise
---
You should get a bigger SSD. Looks like your windows is compressing everything.

All 8 buttons plus scroll wheel and 2 extra edge buttons are all easily accessible by just the index and middle finger. That's not even counting the shift buttons you can assign which opens up for more actions. The mouse cost a little more than normal gaming mouse but it can be had for much cheaper if you look for sales.
---
Just called being a rich fuck with poor planning skills, trustfund baby woop woop. just buy your lvl 60 when u get back.
---
people in chat who say lots of racist things whether they really believe them or just want to be edgy, it's not a great thing to see all the time
---
I was a rogue so I can't say for sure, but it didn't appear to
---
If you don't care about being top 10 on the dps meter u should definitely try going ele or enh at 60 for pvp and raids. I've seen some people play it on pservers and its no as dogshit as ppl tend to speak of it as. Obviously it's not as good as mage or fury warr but still isn't dogshit. I cant recall a single time someone in my raid/dungeon grp has had any problem with us having an enh shaman in the grp.
---
Why can't it be both? Both pandering to the players and getting new players into the game.
---
I totally agree that not every change was a bad change. Most of the guild changes were quite nice. Ui changes. Removal of daily quests. Challenge mode dungeons. Just to name a few.
---
The ghosts grant soul shards, great way to farm them quickly.
---
Which are very handy for point #3!
---
Idk if this will work to their liking because BFA still has a hefty box price. 
---
I doubt many people who want to play Classic that would be willing to play retail don't already have BFA and have given it a shot and I don't think many people who don't already have BFA would wanna pay the box price to play it.
---
Haha wish I was buddy, worked my ass off for a year to get this trip going. Hope you'll have a great day :)
---
I am. Have been pretty torn but think I'm decided now that Troll &gt; Undead in most cases.
---
Have Joana said that he will take payment for his guides?
---
He admitted to that a bit in an interview with Scott Johnson from the Instance podcast. 
---
Basically said that he was going through a divorce at that time. And that he felt like his world was coming apart. And that he recognized that artists always put a piece of themselves into their work, he feels he may have gone overboard. And that some of the creative team gave pushback at the time (Cataclysm's development) but that Chris insisted. Said there was one quest in the game whose dialogue he still finds deeply embarrassing and on-the-nose, if I recall.
---
Essentially he might agree.
---
Omegalul true--- but they'll play how they want to :)
---
this was 2006, pal. you can say almost anything in chat now and it's pretty unlikely you'll get banned unless you're spamming
---
Some people like the idea of having machine guns during Ancient Rome's wars. Don't knock it.
---
When I was 4 or 5 I played warcraft 2 well until I was around 9 or 10 (I was shit at it onviously. Kind of hard to do missions when you can't understand what the mission is). Then the game busted. Fast forward a few years and I see the warcraft episode of South Park. I flipped my lid. I loved the game so much and begged my parents to get it for me, but it turns out our computer wouldn't be able to run it. We finally upgraded the shitty computer to a slightly less shitty computer and I got the game in 7th grade for passing my science class.
---
I started either late BC or early Wrath. Our Internet connection was so bad it took days, possibly a little over a week to completely download the whole game. But when it finished it was like 4 or 5 AM and I snuck out of my room to play before I had to go to school. Made an Undead Warrior on (I think) Blackrock.
---
This, my realm was great for alliance but borderline dead for horde. All horde raid progress died after bwl and soon only the pvp guild was left.
---
I have literally no idea what the hell you just said
---
Go Go banana shoulders!
---
Race changes
---
Make sure you make a Mage friend to conjure you drinks! Balance doesn't get anything cool like Priests with their Spirit Tap or Warlocks with their Life Tap. You're stuck drinking after every fight like Elemental Shaman and it's very slow to level.
---
As others have said no shop would be acceptable imo-any form of microtransaction is enough to ruin the original feel of the game. Do you want a pet? Buy it from the AH/farm it. Want to change the look of your character? Too bad, reroll. Want to transfer server? Sure thing, make it happen old school. Want cosmetic items/transmog? Go play retail.
---
BUTTLICKER, OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER
---
It's quite a shame, it was more a reflection of poor storytelling and time in my opinion than mine
---
Don't you want to hang out in stormwind to try and grab rallying cry of the dragonslayer? I mean, the flight time seems less important than a world buff.
---
Yeah they talk about the tools they created for this that basically can be used going forward
---
You do need enough healers though, which is basically the source of everyone's min maxing.
---
"There's 40 raid spots, you can definitely bring my enhance shaman even though I'm doing horrible dps."
---
"We'd love to dude, but again only three healers showed up. There is no raid tonight, again."
---
Arguably better than boobie shoulders.
---
It’s not really about bashing it, it’s more about disagreeing with the assumption that if you don’t min/max and play the right spec that you’ll never get into a guild or be able to raid. That’s the issue.
---
What kind of sleep schedule do you have bro
---
57 is my least favorite. You're not 58, because next comes the light at the end of the tunnel. 59 to 60 has the most experience, but you're cruising at that point. 57-58 is the worst.
---
LOOOOUUD NOOOIISES
---
If people are not playing their Druid at 60, then raiding guilds obviously aren't going to have Druids in their raids.  Not sure what leveling speed and flavorful quests have to do with raids not finding Druids.
---
Mommy never loved him
---
&gt; if you don’t min/max and play the right spec that you’ll never get into a guild or be able to raid. That’s the issue.
---
No one really says that. They just don't want you in their guild or raid.
---
That's awesome man, good for you! Hearing voice actors irl is always surreal, this must have been a big moment!
---
It takes 11 respecs to get to the point where you're forking over 50g per respec. Respeccing is a good gold-sink for the games' economy. It's a good cost/value relationship. Want to be the perfect spec for PvP or PvE from day to day? that costs you. 
---
If you can't bring yourself to PvP in a PvE spec for some fun with friends, then pay the money and make it count. Know this, there are likely people on the other team who are doing the same calculus, and are often PvE specced as well.
---
It is amazing in PVP.
---
i mean... a competent group can clear BRD in full at lvl 55-60 in like 90-120 mins
---
Yeah it technically was a raid and it's the biggest dungeon in vanilla. Low-key a masterpiece , but also a labyrinth that can crush a group's will.
---
You'll be fine, just have to adapt. Be prepared for the class to be still broken when the game is released though-there was A LOT of genuine bugs affecting hunters and I doubt that they would had managed to address all of them.
---
Good change, sir.
---
1.5 hours seems a bit light for full clear.  I'm going off of memeory though.
---
Yeah druids are the least played class but they aren't *that* rare, you can totally find bear tanks for your groups while leveling. Also pretty much every druid is feral while leveling so all they need to do is maybe throw on a couple stam heavy pieces and they are good to go. Not to mention aoe threat in dungeons is a fair bit easier for druids than warriors since swipe hits 3 targets with no CD.
---
Thing is they change the combat log and now that's breaking combat log parsers (yes that was a thing back in vanilla) and now your add-ons are broken again. Who knows what systems internally this change affects as well.
---
I don't think people realize that "sure why not" changes sometimes have hundreds maybe even thousands of dependencies - and having a blizzard employee on a forum commit engineering to what sound like simple changes is the best way to a develope a product as complex as this.
---
If anything blizzard gets in more trouble for committing to something on a forum, panel or on one of their twitch broadcasts (which they do constantly!) and then not delivering on it fully (because maybe it was impossible to implement) or taking it away later - essentially setting expectations poorly.
---
If you're planning to dip out you should play a dps?
---
Nades, lip, shadow reflector is all you really need as a mage to counter everything in the game.
---
Nothing of what warrior is in classic existed in the post-cata era of warrior design. So give it a try but have a back up if you dont like it.
---

---
My only gripe with theme parks is they're too packed with people to ever be enjoyable.
---
A Disney shareholder did say they wanted Disney to buy Acti-Blizz
---
I could feel this comment straight in my heart. I think I might be crying of joy once I login on the 27th. The anticipation is real.
---
Nothing more fun than female orc dual wield animations! They look awesome, ill be playing one.
---
It's pretty painful to level. Much easier to pick it up at 60, and then just solo low level dungeons for loot to disenchant, and level it up that way. 
---
I mean you can do it, and you'll still be able to level, but it's a pretty substantial gold sink.
---
I met Smulders and Her hubby Taren here at the resort as well, they were so nice and funny. Honestly, this is my first job after getting out of the Army, and it’s definitely unlike security almost anywhere else. There’s a huge emphasis on guest relations and helping people over acting like a hard ass, even when things go wrong. It’s a great corporate culture and I really enjoy it. The pay isn’t bad either lol.
---
I'm a Disney shareholder and I say they should not.
---
I remember Maraudon took 8 hours. I think it was late TBC, but may be early WotLK. That was one epic experience.
---
Yes Horde duel a lot more. They’re more into pvp and Orgrimmar gates is a far better dueling spot.
---
Care to elaborate? I don't think anyone asked for a complete set of new gear with every patch, get pruned every expansion, farm something all expansion long just for it to be taken away the next expac. You know, some of the biggest problems right now.
---
Yeah you couldn’t be more wrong. SW will be empty compared to IF.
---
Gnomes and humans also get salvation which leads me to believe that gnomes with the int buff do the most dps out of all the locks
---
Cool.
---
The guide would have to be split up in different chapters somehow. /u/judgement_classicwow can tell you what happens when you load a whole guide at once. :)
---
People that don't prepare to kill a raid boss properly honestly shouldn't be raiding in the first place. Once you have that raid on farm, THEN play your meme specs.
---
Are you going horde PvP? I can just follow you and save you a few g’s
---
Nah, the Lich King isn't Arthas.
---
My wow addiction helped me through a pretty brutal breakup. Met some lifelong friends who have followed me through many many other games.
---
im more interested in the eventual responses from the nochanges crowd
---
I...don't agree with that, but netherstorm is my favorite set so....biases
---
Warrior paladin imo, priest loses alot of healing from not being able to use bubble (no rage from taking dmg). Plus might buff is the best. The pally can go ret and just offheal when necessary. Another benefit is, the paladin can throw on a shield and tank an instance if the warr wants to DPS :)
---
Boars were my favorite. In classic there is no gore though.  So you are only able to have charge, bite, and growl on a pig. All of these abilities have a cool down so unlike pets with claw or lightning breath pigs have no way to dump their focus. The inability to dump focus means your pet will always have unspent focus and thus leaving potential dps/threat on the table. 
---
I do love boars,  but they are not as good until TBC.
---
Remember that classic has raw version of warriors. Many flaws are there. Stance dance is a real thing, basically you are a sand bag to kick and get punched by, mages, hunters, warlocks, pvp rogues. And other classes, if they know “how” to play and act counter for your weaknesses. You are pretty much fucked up whilst leveling in pvp servers. Good thing is, you are getting used to doing corpse runs which helps alot in progressive part of end games. 
---
Unless you have buddies, you will have hard time of finding a raid groups as dps due half the classic. Players intending to play warrior. Remember for loots competition against 10-15 person at least. 
---
But if you plan over tank/prot since day 1 and start from there, believe me the things changed like day/night. Competition in raids are almost nothing for you, You will get what you want most of your wish list in no time. Even its getting quite boring sometimes, IF you do a good tanking. For that, just be a friend with an experienced warrior / tank and listen-sync yourself to his playstyle. There is always a born warrior in most guilds cause when you go warrior, you cant get back from there. Its a disease you cant resist the pain and frustration of failing as warrior.
---
Yeah! And if you want to join me, I'll throw all these consumables at you too. Well, at least the ones I can buy.
---
Someone didn't play on Private Servers or the Beta...
---
I’m going alchemist I’ll sling you some shit too.
---
Fury/arm swarrior. You can tank most dungeons no problem while leveling, and iirc they are top tier DPS when raiding (fury) and arms is top tier PvP, especially with a healer
---
/swoon
---
For pve Fury Warrior is probably the most fun you can have in Vanilla raiding. Their play style is just so much fun and so satisfying. Rogue rotation is not the dullest in the game but I think it’s boring compared to Fury.
---
Exactly this. The game was better when blizz just made a game they found fun for them selfs back then.
---
Druid T1 is a shit tree looking set. T2 is where it gets sexy.
---
You’ve never played vanilla or you wouldn’t be this clueless.
---
I'd pay around $20 max.
---
Ew
---
heaps
---
Warlock with a felhunter is a pretty hard counter.
---
We get the boring without anything where the elites die way too fast.
---
Gotta say thanks to you Sable17.
---
This comment has aligned the stars in my mind and I've now settled on my class! I'll be rolling a Warlock with Tailoring&amp; Enchanting.
---
I feel like they made a great move with mythic dungeons and M+ and having to actually go to the dungeon again. Of course it's still faster than vanilla because there are more flight points and it only takes any two people to summon, but you at least have to know where the entrance is.
---
The stuff you queue and get auto-grouped for is such low-tier content these days I wonder if people that complain about it are actually going to ever get anywhere in classic.
---
Mage definitely has appeal. Best CC for dungeons (IMO), and you're right no respeccing costs between dungeons and PVP.
---
That’s already a thing in America.  Don’t wander into an Walmarts in Texas...
---
1) Losing 5% of your users is terrible, and if this was the actual figure, there would literally not be a single corpse in the game. Wow's success comes in part from lower system requirements and this is why, say, Star Citizen, will never have a very large population.
---
2) The problem isn't corpses, the problem is the delta of performance. Corpses are just one system that could potentially add more load, and by itself it might be fine, but it is then a system that risks causing poor performance when combined with other systems that might generate additional objects.
---
Then it reset the swing timer
---
Warrior to 28 -&gt; rogue to 39 -&gt; priest to 60.
---
bring a dps shaman and it's not an issue ;)
---
no
---
He became green jesus during cata
---
[Glad you agree!](https://imgur.com/ohgN8FW)
---
I'll settle for a damn dance studio.
---
Thinking other people enjoying the game the way they like is a bad thing.
---
Stealth runs are great but they wont make you crazy rich. Basically with 2 druids and some rogues you can in 1-2 days farm every dungeon you want to totally gear out. Problem is finding quality folks. It was the only way I would have put up completing the wild/feralheart sets and ubrs key.
---
lots of BRD bosses have exceptional good loot aswell. That dungeon was underrated back in Vanilla.
---
Once classic starts I'll prob leave this sub. Dont need to hear about peoples shitty streams
---
even in Rift: Planes of Telara where every class has a tanking option, you still have tanks in demand.
---
&gt; the biggest problem is they tend to end up imbalanced in favor of Aliance.
---
And since they're PVE, it's really not an issue.
---
Let me guess. You will be a Warrior in classic.
---
Seriously, if the group was enjoyable to play with I'd still be happy to do half a dungeon with a fun group of people than a full dungeon with nerdragers.
---
LOK’TAR!
---
I'm no expert at poly clay, but I think it's not optimal for this kind of detail. There are however special clay for minis like this. I want to point out though I have not done this with clay. The model itself is out of games workshops line, this one in their "Finecast" mold which me and many other dont like... their plastic molds however are excellent. 
---
I use some clay for base work. But except that the closest I get to clay is using "green stuff" which can be used to connect plastic, sculpt things etc, however rarely used to make full models.
---
Shaman to Mage, stuck through with shaman all of vanilla, but rerolled before tbc.
---
Warlock has been a serious contender for that exact reason, and for the cheaper mounts.
---
Good news about not much game time is that you play at almost 100% rested XP, and there is alot of downtime to research effective levelling and questing guides
---
Your username
---
Literally waiting for the Remastered version.   
---
But I'm scared that I will be losing my life to WoW that I won't be able to start W3.  
---
Hype is through the roof though.
---
Heh my intention and dream would be to study the cognitive benefits of video games - such as what is frequently being done with Starcraft 2. 
---
That’s a fair guess. It’s something I don’t personally understand very well - I find it obnoxious, not interesting. Why people follow blatantly stupid things would be something worth studying, perhaps I might better understand some asinine things - like America and its love for muppet man. Not entirely sure I want too though, but it’s a thought.
---
alright I honestly had no idea that people dueled outside of SW now. there are tons of alliance dueling outside of SW. phew. thanks everyone\~
---
Pve servers are my default servers. I pvp a lot and I play many pvp shooters. But I generally don’t like to pvp when I pve. 
---
But this time around I will play pvp server. Added dimension and it’s just a repeat. I mean. I played vanilla. I have already experienced it
---
Anything other then healer or tank will make lfg A LOT worse. So if that is important you only have those two choices
---
Played an Orc hunter till 30 something where I got absolutely stomped by a druid in stv. He killed me over and over even letting me heal up and revive pet etc then engage him when I was ready. I still died over and over. I took note of his name then rolled a Night Elf Druid and got advice from him on 1v1 pvp as a feral druid. so hard for most classes to fight 1v1 in the world while leveling.
---
That's sadly one of my realisations. My favorite dongeons in the game are the big ones like Maraudon and BRD. As an adult, I highly doubt I'll be able to sit on the computer for 2-5 hours straight without having to deal with some shit or some people around me.
---
I'd pay a couple grand as well.  Imagine spending thousands of a gaming setup just for WoW and noping out of the greatest game ever made at $80+.  Blizzard's going to get that money too, will be subbed for a long time on several accounts.
---
That’s an interesting take. Probably something to it
---
Fishing/Cooking/First Aid.
---
Doing it all.
---
I really hope they add an option to clone your character then, so you can keep playing vanilla but also TBC.
---
No reason to suspect it won't be August 12 3PM PST.
---
I started as a rogue on day 1, and still play rogue today. I spent the first month of Wrath as a DK and the first month of Pandaria as a warrior. Both times I got bored and went back to the rogue.
---
Well I’m not arguing with you, as I said there are those who do.
---
Iirc it is 6pm pst on the 12th, just figure out what time it is if you're outside of the zone.
---
6PM EST, 3PM PST.
---
Fixed my post, thanks
---
Thinking of getting rank 10 during phase 2, otherwise PvE will be my main focus with some casual pvp thrown into the mix.
---
Thinking of leveling as skinning/herb, then drop skinning for alch at 60.
---
But it might be more worth to have alch on your alt and get engineering for your main.
---
I swear you’d be more use to me if I turned you into luggage.
---
Really? You couldn’t find it anywhere? Not even in the 2nd link when you google “wow classic name reserve”?
---
It’s exactly 2 weeks before release, so whatever time release is in your region just be ready 2 weeks earlier. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291719/claim-your-character-name-in-classic-character-creation-starts-august-12th-13th
---
But holy shock is a great tanking talent. 
---
Its a ranged pull plus it's a good instant threat generator.
---
5GB at 512KB/s is almost 3 hours. Unacceptable!
---
Of course an emergency can always happen no one will shit on you for that. The people who are not genuine about it will be found out anyway since they will try the same trick too often.
---
Its the same way here. Bring up retail and you get shit on. Makes absolutley no sence. Totally different games. Retail has gorgeous art,amazing raids, a number or collector oriented things etc.
---
I dont even pkay retail but it dord have its strengths.
---
My R11 grind started [2018/4/4](https://i.imgur.com/5sM1sya.jpg)  ended [2018/5/23](https://i.imgur.com/cglQRrI.jpg)  , 10 hrs a day ,server : Lightbringer  .
---
I'll give a try  to R13 on classic for the shoulder .
---
I mean, you can believe what you want. You definitely come off a lot more childish and offensive here than you do in your videos.
---
Can you please specify what are you referring to?
---
So I've always heard anecdotes about celebrities running into funny/awkward situations with security where they're missing credentials, so I'm curious to ask someone who clear is close to this line of work: how much truth is there to this? 
---
Are most people you run into laid back and aware that you're being a pain in the ass for their security or are a lot of them secretly just asshole?
---
This starts off like one of those memes but doesn't end like it.
---
I was full expecting something like "Chris then dropped his pants and took a shit in the middle of the airport shouting "I AM THE REAL WARCHIEF"
---
There won't be BGs in phase 1 or 2, just saying.
---
Not in Classic.
---
Part of the problem of using a single character as your outlet for years. Your darkest moments are their weakest points as well.
---
Just play when you get back. The game is still going to be there, and I can't imagine it would be that satisfying to play on a PC that isn't yours, without addons.
---
Just don't waste people's time in general.  I remember having enough time to do a dungeon many times *if people would just get moving!*  Having two hours to play and a group ready to go to some mid level dungeon sucks when you're standing outside for 30 minutes while people repair, and vendor, and train, and poop, and take out the trash, and grab a snack/drink, and let the dog out to pee.
---
"Increased Staves +6"
---
Lol why?
---
And I assume you meant Master's Cane for Druids? They don't get Chance on Hit affects...
---
Nice to see another CM in the sub! 
---
I’m jelly, I worked today and didn’t see him but I’m glad that he was wonderful!
---
I'll be streaming for a bit. Preparing for launch in case anyone wants to hang or have questions.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/pyntetv
---
Not for leveling while trying to afford 40 mount
---
I'd be interested to see what happened if some cult-of-personality nonsense guild fed a moonkin gear, like Esfand with ret.
---
Yes in Classic. [Patch 1.12.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0):
---
&gt; Eviscerate: Manual of Eviscerate (Rank 9) now drops off Blackhand Assassins in Black Rock Spire. In addition, Eviscerate now increases in potency with greater attack power.
---
There a quite a few odd items in classic, might just be another one of them. Might be useful for enhance shamans though.
---
I would say yes. In my small office alone there are 4 co workers who can't wait.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Thank god that the name reservation allows up to 3 characters! Thinking that priest will definitely make the top 3
---
Any dwarf, pally, shaman, priest.. or anyone who cares about pvp would have jungle remedies to dispell diseases.
---
Yes.
---
The other way around, actually. I just dont want to do extra trips to IF to get the stuff i need :)
---
kinda crazy to think about how guildwars1 already had guild-wide "garrisons" over a decade ago, AND each one functioned as the equivalent of a Battleground (since you could pvp other guilds in them), AND there were about a dozen different ones to choose from.
---
but of course, blizzard being a small indie company, we can only afford to get just one of these things each expansion.
---
Have they whipped Battlefront 2 into shape yet?
---
Could be. Its just my thoughts on what a gold sink is
---
He earned it.  He was a big part of some of the best games ever to grace a PC.  Lived the dream!  Earned the right to just chill for the rest of his days.  
---
I do, however, wish we had a 25 year old version of him running the show though.  All that success and all those great games earn you the right to retire young.  What's left now that guys like him are gone is a bunch of corporate stooges trying to sell you loot crates.
---
Got any more details? Is it still doable?
---
This is reassuring, looking forward to trying it out!
---
Even without an in-game cashshop they should still be able to charge for the usual metagaming services like name changes, server transfers, race changes.
---
I believe you dont bring an enhancemnt to dps, just need him getting as many wf/SS hits with a nightfall as well as totem twist and throw a chain heal when there is nothing better to do( meaning you proc'd nightfall)
---
Even female dwarves?
---
My first character was a dwarf hunter, I got to like level 7-8ish and I saw a druid in Kharanos running around in bear form. I thought it was the coolest shit ever. I knew instantly I picked the wrong class and I ended up maining druid up until mid wrath.
---
Thanks for the answers . But I was wondering if you respecced at 40 to Ele wouldnt your Gear be useless since it doesnt dépend on intellect spirit and what not or does Agi and strength still work for Ele ?
---
It’s funny. After reading Lord of the Clans and playing through WC3, when I first fired up WoW and made a Shaman, in my head, I made him a young Orc who idolized Thrall and wanted to be just like him. Lol
---
Classic is going to have a world chat right?  You at least won't have to go back to a city to spam.
---
Heard about the barman. Didn’t know you could beat him that early tho! 
---
Never thought about enchanting, but that might be worth considering. Thanks mate!
---
Just crush everyone in pve spec cause you’re a raider not a pathetic normie. Problem solved.
---
thank GOD I have no family so I can play WOW as much as I want.
---
They're just inbred trolls.
---
So might be worth rolling two druids instead of two rogues? Well this gives me more to think about. Thank you dude!
---
I can just imagine the response if it hadn't been Chris Metzen. "Chris Who?" "A developer for World of Warcraft." "World of what?"
---
Everyone knows bottoms have all the power.
---
I mean you know how to do thé most damage without needing to be oom every 2 mobs .
---
I started playing a few weeks before TBC with my brother, and played a lot with his warrior, both during levelling and end game (casual raiding).
---
Now, I'm planning on making a tank for wow classic.
---
I remember how easy it was to find groups for dungeons, but I never had to struggle on finding a guild for raiding since I tanked in his guild when my brother was not available for a raid. So here's my question:
---
Since there is a need for only one MT and a few OT for 40man raids, how hard is it going to be to find a guild for casual raiding or pug raids?
---
But seriously, does anyone actually have that info?
---
Was wondering myself, as my dungeon memories are murky, and all of a sudden people now claim that you can finish MC in 3 hours.
---
Yeah bookins were amazing... In tbc
---
Oomkins, in vanilla, on the otherhand were not so great. Maybe in bgs if u had good gear.
---
I am insanely jealous
---
People asked for better balance, and there was a shit ton of QQing about high end players doing more damage despite having an extremely similar item level.
---
"Why can I not get into M+ my Ilvl is whatever."
---
So they simplified rotations.
---
if you level it with leatherworking for example, you can disenchant the stuff you make from leatherworking to help level enchanting
---
What a time that was... so many emotions.
---
And when layering gets turned off in Phase 2, do you think they will just split everyone on that server into multiple servers? That would be a shit storm. Guilds would be torn asunder.  
---
They need to have all the servers ready for launch.
---
Right?
---
Ah, that moment when you literally peak after looting your first set of level 15-16 gray shoulders. No matter cloth, leather or mail, I'll be putting those sum' bitches on and rocking them till I get my greens.
---
In fact it's such a critical moment in character progression that if I ever loot a 2nd pair of shoulders, I will always try to give them either to my friends or just to a random passerby to make his/her day.
---
Why?
---
I'm not hearing a bad side here 🙃
---
This time around make a guild "Is pee supposed to be red?"
---
&gt; They need to have all the servers ready for launch.
---
No they don't. If their projections show they'll need more than one server per type/region/language/timezone, they'll make more as soon as possible. It could be days or even hours after launch, but there's no reason to have them ready at launch. Even if the original launch servers need to bleed population, free transfers to avoid queues are better than server mergers because they launched too many.
---
[“Shunned”](https://i.imgur.com/sUqe5Of.jpg)
---
I have only one Warcraft book and it's Arthas.
---
If there are dead realms, and I hope they remove layering before that. Also your name is mage girl but your sign is a warlock. Phony!
---
It's like a resume of our good memories in Vanilla
---
[“not liked by the internet”](https://i.imgur.com/sUqe5Of.jpg)
---
If your going to be a prick and call out OP. At least post the Time to reserve names so everyone else who clicks this post has an answer. Not a douch reply. Forcing me to click on a link instead  of giving a 3 word answer is also a douche move.
---
People that played on pservers most likely wasn’t very casual. I believe you Can go hemo pve when classic comes.
---
Unless you're involved with devilsaur mafia or really grinding gold hours a day most people don't have the 600+ gold to get Edgemasters early on in phase1-3 after the couple hundred from lionheart's. Otherwise you're playing half the content without it.
---
Why do you expect there to be a queue available to get into before the server goes live?
---
I didn’t specifically say the time but indicated it twice in my post.
---
3% crit for other melee op.
---
Why does this statement make you worried? Did you assume the algorithms to be used for classic were somehow unique and more advanced compared to the ones used for retail?
---
The time squidward.
---
It’s just Zandalar when referring to the empire.
---
Can't wait for this story to get retconned too.
---
You can grind 100g in 2-4 hours depending on server population, gear, etc. If you don't have the time find someone that plays a lot of classic and wants to trade gold for game time and try to make a deal with trading a token for the 400-500g you need.
---
40% crit maybe withe every world buff and you never dying. 
---
&gt;so it's 4.4/140
---
Crits generate more rage than normal hits (double) so you effectively increase ability damage more than the base crit increase.
---
Doors have pockets now?
---
Wow I remember that name from Kirin Tor. What a small world.
---
People say Blizzard doesn't expect Classic to be big, but in the latest interview they said they are treating Classic like a normal expansion and the whole WoW team is helping out for launch.
---
There's a graphical slider and 3/10 is marked "classic". That'll be the closest thing to the OG client.
---
Hi. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. That's quite inspiring actually.
---
Have you tried going deep prot first? Does Reckoning make a difference?
---
- More blizzlike than any previous private servers.
---
- No cashshop, XP-bonuses or other paid-services.
---
- Capable of supporting 15k concurrent players at the same time. Previous private servers would go down on their knees at 2-3k players.
---
- Better, more authentic scripting than previous servers. Everything just *felt* so close to actual vanilla.
---
Well, I never tried normal, but heroic certainly requires more attention than the OP is talking about. Even LFR Dazar'alor had the freeze gauntlet you need to pay attention to.
---
The Alliance races for PvP are pretty neck and neck for rogues, imo, excluding humans who are obviously the PvE choice.. I think having an inherent stealth buff is more powerful all-around for a stealth class rather than a detecting cooldown.
---
Escape artist and stoneform are undeniably good but Shadowmeld makes stealth more potent so you're inherently better against other people using stealth. And since it's an Alliance race, it's not as though you have to worry about rogues Stoneforming your Blind except for duels (which I wouldn't recommend anyone base their race choice on).
---
Also that dodge chance is pretty good. The only relevant racial stat gnomes/dwarves get are the small amount of Frost resistance that dwarves have, which I don't really think is comparable to a whole percentage of dodge on such a squishy class.
---
You can easily raid casually in classic with PUGs to a point. He might have to wait longer but let's not pretend people didn't PUG MC constantly on privates for a decade
---
Welcome to the internet squidward
---
DD/MM/YYYY
---
Tbh this was not a bad example of doing what the players want but a lot of what makes retail so bad is because blizz listened too much
---
How much difference can it be? Do you mean that supporting a warrior requires more Holy and supporting other classes more Protection?
---
It's still not that high, it's an increased benefit due to flurry uptime and rage gain is relative to damage anyway, not critting in itself in vanilla, thats after tbc normalisation, so in vanilla crit=more rage isn't true for a higher scaling, as increasing your damage itself increases rage gain as well.
---
No horde druid then. ;D
---
Shadowknights and Necromancers have always been my go-to class archetype for mmos. I rolled a Warrior in WoW because I wanted to tank, and there was no Shadowknight equivelant to do so.
---
I've also been playing my Necromancer in GW2 a lot and getting into the DoT spec for it. So I figure it'll be a good transition.
---
I actually met Chris 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but mod fucking Chris himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there sipping a cup of tea and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Chris, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Chris put down his cup of tea, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barber shop. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.

K*onos fanboy I presume?
---
I was working 12 hour shifts with 1.5h commute during vanilla.  I was able to knock out one dungeon (two if I was lucky) on a work night.  Time management and organisation with a solid friends list will do wonders.
---
It was as close as any private server had gotten in 2015, and it was pretty damn close.
---
Thank you for this. As a returning Classic player with hazy memories I was really concerned I’d be the guy this post advocates against but now I have a measuring stick to help me out.
---
When I saw the title I thought it was a alliance guilde running trough enemy territory and punching trolls naked
---
Is he going to play classic?
---
I know what it means to play mage at a high level and it‘s just so easy to win against other classes. You have big instants, best slows, best ccs and roots, blink and if you fuck up, there is still iceblock. 
---
Playing mage allows so many mistakes without beeing punished, which makes it for me not a very hard class to play. 
---
If you are a noob, ofc it may be hard to play mage but its even harder then to play another caster, like wl. As a wl you have nothing from the above and you get rekt by melees very easily where as a mage melees are mostly default wins
---
Sword art online is a damn good alternative to a wow-like world. It's actually really good
---
Perhaps so, but intellectual property is kinda badly defined. There hasnt been any legal official options for vanilla wow appart for private servers, yet blizzard still kept shutting servers down. It is kindof like attaching a self-destruct device to an old piece or art, and then when you release a *"new, better"* version of that art you destroy all previous versions.
---
Like George Lucas did.
---
Not really, mages can win the dmg races pretty easily with iceblock
---
Give us Arthas already ffs. I’ll take an indie scourge horror film with no major characters aside from arthas showing up at the very end or some shit, just give us the Lich King.
---
I didn't because the talents early on in the tree didnt seem very appealing. I later went back to ret around mid 40's but it was still mana starved. I think if you do aim to run every dungeons + quests, along the way you won't have much issue. I played at weird hours though and didn't do any 5 man dungeons while leveling myself tbh. Just make sure you have another gear set for whichever roles you want and if tanking keep your 1h weapon skill up to date
---
&gt; I've heard now days mobs scale with your level no matter the zone or area
---
well, not entirely no matter where, but yeah, vanilla zones go to 60 if you're 60+, and BFA zones are all 120 if you're 120. And sometimes if you're 111, because bliz is dumb
---
Ruined my 20's, now it's time to ruin my 30's. Lets go!
---
"Oh you don't have purps? Sorry."
---
You can compare your components to those of Classic minimum requirements online. Thats what I did.
---
raid in pvp spec ! haha
---
I don't have a sub but I could prelead Classic.
---
? You can queue LFR in retail and literally go AFK and unless some sweaty LFR hero spots you and convinces everyone to kick you you’ll still get rewarded. 
---
Your rotation in classic might be easier but just getting your foot in the door at an acceptable level to raid takes an immense amount of time.
---
I was immediately fascinated with the game the moment I rolled my first character, a Nelf Druid. I think it was the combat system, the art style, and the prospect of exploring a brand new fantasy world filled with thousands of players that hooked me. What kept me going after that was the feeling of progressing my character and the enjoyment of doing a dungeon for the first few times, learning about its layout, its bosses, and of course getting the loot upgrades. I never knew what raiding was until I was about a year into playing the game and TBC had come out, but once I discovered it I fell in love all over again.
---
It's kind of crazy how many fun utility abilities have been lost over time. Hunters were amazing scouts for rares and potential world pvp threats in classic.
---
So this upcomming stress test we can set up our UI and addons and they will stay untill classic launches? im confused because i thought this stress test would use the "Beta" client like previous stress tests.
---
Arthas, ends with him "defeating" Mal'Ganis and going to Northrend. Arthas: Reign of Chaos, ends with him resurrecting Kel'Thuzad and destorying Silvermoon. Arthas: The Frozen Throne, ends with his fight against Illidan and him ascending the Frozen Throne. Arthas: The Lich King, ends with Tirion Fording killing Arthas. 
---
I don't think a trilogy is enough to tell the whole story and my ordering would cut out the summoning of Archimonde and the
---
Kalimdor storyline already.
---
Cdew mainly changed for dueling though, and this topic is discussing lvling. Elemental has stupid amounts of burst past lvl 40, hence his success in one of the duelling tournaments.
---
It was the former CEO that forced him to do it, as a final ”act” for the community. Its in an interview.
---
You have a lot of good points. I've never done most of those dungeons at the appropriate level so it's good to know they can be split into smaller runs. 
---
In truth I do kind of like the sound of running a dungeon with the express purpose of clearing certain areas and defeating certain boss(es). Makes it feel a lot more epic and like a mini-raid. P (Perfect for someone like me who's unlikely to ever be able to commit to an actual raid schedule.)
---
Did you put on him a chip or something that i could follow to meet him too??? All legal ofc.
---
You are a Security guy.. i mean... easy job! ;)
---
The great majority of item with proc that deal damages unfortunately do not scale. Only a few of them does at it seems, and we’ll only see this when classic drops and we test every single items !
---
Stoneform is broken for rogues. You hardcounter other rogues and it allows you to reset against Warriors and Hunters because stoneform removes bleed and poison allowing you to vanish and get a clean reset. The extra frost resistance is more than welcome against Frost Mages. Resisting the odd frost nova or frostbite is amazing. Playing nelf rogue in pvp you’re just arbitrarily gimping yourself because the racials are useless.
---
I wish more dungeons (mini-raid really) were designed like BRD. 
---
A huge, multi-cultured non-linear DUNGEON. It is awesome to just walk around and explore BRD, 
---
It feels like stepping into the Mines of Moria, just epic.
---
That really hit at home. It's too bad those days are gone though. What I would give to forget everything wow related and relive these exact moments again. I miss sporting my defias set and bad ass cruel barbs regardless of the stats.
---
Wtf I got chills just reading this. Meeting a legend such as Chris Metzen!!!
---
Some are waiting since years, I remember joining a level 60 only guild during Wotlk...
---
Regardless of spec and weapon type you'd end up with, shaman has a lot of quality of life stuff that shouldn't be overlooked. Great for solo play, can heal dungeons, ghost wolf at lvl 20 etc. While maybe the typical auto attack while waiting for WF procs isn't that engaging, it's just one part of the class's utility.
---
Stupid squidward
---
The settings themselves are basically identical to the retail/BFA client.  Here's what I'm using in the Classic client (basically everything maxed): https://imgur.com/a/7p7Y4M9
---
The things that have the highest impact on performance are Anti-Aliasing and the stuff under the "Effects" section.
---
I think it’s a really good thing to have the real Vanilla enthusiasts here and all the people that want Vanilla/classic+ in another subreddit.
---
If you want your „open discussion“ go where people wanting to hear your take on this.
---
It’s not always „the others“ that are the problem.
---

My main was a human warrior I levelled all the way to 60 and geared up to pre raid bis. Just couldn't commit to full time tanking raiding. 
---
I then rerolled a human warlock and got him into my brother's guild where I was able to do MC, BwL, ZG and AQ 20 with him.
---
I got my Undead Mage in tbc to 38 in dustwallow marsh when I made my first alt a Tauren Druid. Levelled it to around 20 before hopping back to the mage.
---
Oh my god its mindbogglingly boring. Please dont roll shaman
---
*more raidspots for me*
---
The time sink comes from preperation outside of raids for raiding, especially later on as we move through the phases.
---
The first time sink (after leveling) is getting pre-raid bis which will consume a lot more time than combined than multiple clears of the raids.
---
I agree that raiding is a lot more casual though, less time commitment inside the raid but don't expect to get an easy ride if you don't do the preperation.  Most retail guilds are what 3-4 days a week, 4 hours a day?  Most good guilds will clear MC + Ony in one raid.  It's when more raid content comes out that it begins to become more time consuming as there will always be something to farm out from the previous raids.  Albeit you'll be able to clear MC in under 2 hours, it's still going to add half a raid day for previous content.
---
Chepi FTW.

---
Right. I forgot about that. Is it still 60$, 1 year later? You can still play the old expa s I guess
---
I started as orc warrior and.. Ended as him. Never rerolled.
---
&gt; 4% more damage in other stats also equals the same average rage gain benefit, so then the 4% dmg increase is still 4% dmg increase because it's still relative to itself.
---
You don't get other stats however. You get a totem , you don't get to pick twisting 2 str totems as there aren't two str totems. In this case the 4% increased damage from crit is more rage. Its more than just 4% increased rage generation, becuase as a Fury warrior you get 6.5% dodges, 21% misses, 40% glancing blows which are (~70% damage = less rage and damage) and up to 32.5% crit which do double damage (on dual wield whites, on abilities glancing doesn't exist nor does crit cap, well its too high to ever hit.)   Thus again it at 28% crit its 10% more damage thus rage.
---
Why only 100g? Most guilds raid two times a week.
---
Well I have received both Yes and No on my comment but nobody can cite any theorycrafting proving what is best.... This is why I asked in the first place D:
---
Dear god man, why are you even here? Sounds like you don’t like either game.
---
A group of  people in a small community cleaned MC.
---
I'm sure I can grab 40 friends. and clear MC quick.  That's why a guild is needed to raid. 
---
What I'm saying is you cant play this game casually and raid. Doing it casually means people leave and the raid falls apart. And followed by you wont get any items most likely because your not in a guild. The first few months of MC will be a shitfest.
---
People shouldnt compare how the private server game plays to classic. One community is a group of people who loved wow and just abandoned blizzard and the other is the regular community that comes with the game that doesnt gave that experience. 
---
Do you really think if you play this game casually you can get a solid group together? That right there will take a couple hours. Then followed by the constant people leaving and your raid falling apart 
---
Join a damn guild with a raid schedule that works for you. Dont think for a second your going to say to yourself "I'm cant wait to go home and pug raids"
---
It's not how it's going to work. People are to conditioned to current WoW lol
---
Wow was profitable before all the cancer that is micro transactions. Blizzard will earn a buttload of money of classic.
---
Can't remember where I found this, but someone made this neat spreadsheet for which rogue spells you should learn in which spec:

Questing became the clear fastest choice after they buffed the quest xp right? I don't remember when that was though
---
Dude, I saw this *years* ago and just 2 days ago thought of the video with the "smooth feral transition" - and here it is! 
---
That's some coincidence. Thanks a ton, this one's awesome
---
No, it really isn't necessary at all.
---
"What does your metrosexual elf eyes see XxXRealMalfurionXxX?"
---
We usually went to Barrens and Ashenvale
---
**You should not put any points in prot tree when leveling**
---
Tanking 5mans is dogshit easy 1-59 just by spaming sunder-tab-sunder in def-stance.
---
oof
---
Hi, /u/urripities

---
Literally one of the easiest classes to play 'well' in PvP
---
Necessary no, useful yes. For instance if you're lvling with remorseless attacks it's not uncommon to get a beefy SS crit when changing target and getting aggro. It'll of course depend on your tank, or you can avoid it by waiting a bit before attacking, but using feint could be a dps increase comparatively and is good safety utility to have.
---
What the hell
---
Have one toon for pvp and one for pvp, problem solved :P
---
Not to diminish your work or anything... but *why?*
---
Calling the comparison funny is also a stretch
---
I'm pretty sure it is. I think they put it on sale decently frequently, though. They'd be dumb not to discount it before people's first sub ends
---
And they're still fighting there to this day.
---
I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't love it either. In my opinion they should have set it around the War of the Ancients. Then you'd have tons of potential sequels to publish, and we'd get to see Malfurion, Tyrande, Illidan, Rhonin, Korialstrasz, and &gt;!FUCKING BROX WHO THREW HIMSELF THROUGH A DIMENSIONAL PORTAL AND WOUNDED SARGERAS THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS!&lt;!
---
That's... Not how it works, even at Blizzard. Again, people mindlessly hating because "lul Blizzard".
---
when will they advertise the game on twitch and such
---
also i need some server names is that hard...
---
So instead of taking a hybrid that will clash with the mages over x piece of gear you'll take another mage that will clash with the mages over the same piece of gear?
---
Seeing the Scourge invasion of Quel’Thalas or the Battle of Mount Hyhal against the Burning Legion and Archimonde would be amazing.
---
True, however it can be a mana strain, and why wouldn't you also want to double up with an enh sham proccing Nightfall/Annihilator while also spending his otherwise inconsequential mana on Totem Twisting?
---
Don’t feed the troll.
---
If im a top guild yes because mage dps should always be more consistent than hybrid
---
How hard is to play in pvp as a rogue if your big cooldowns are not up?
---
Ex: prep, vanish, blind, etc
---
There is very little gain from skilling blacksmithing while leveling. You wont be able to craft gear for your self. At level 60 there are key items a player can get crafted that is the reason why you choose to be a blacksmith.
---
Lionheart helm is the best warrior helmet a warrior can get for example. Every warrior will be looking for it. However, people will first look to their guild members first to get it crafted. There is no real point for you to take blacksmithing unless you have the knowledge on what recipes to get and where to get them then also have the mindset / means to provide your crafting services for these specific items to accumulate gold. 
---
But yes, generally the best gear comes from dungeons and raids.
---
This is why I recommend you use engineering instead. This will provide you with a lot of different tools to increase your success in both pve and pvp. BUT it requires some extra management in combat (not much extra, you will get use to it)
---
Was there a (short) amount of Spell Queuing in Classic?
---
Us with the 5 fingers on each hand agree though
---
Unacceptable is having that download speed nowadays mate ;D
---
Great post totally agree! I lost interest in either expansion due to those two systems.
---
I was so mad when they removed Eyes of the Beast. It was so useful, I’m glad we’ll be able to use it again.
---
highly doubt that its the same patch version.
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Public\_client\_builds](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Public_client_builds)
---
last beta was  [1.13.2](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.13.2).31209    31209  
---
my guess, release will be 1.13.3 which means you need to edit your addons .toc files to patch number 11330 to have up to date addons.
---
Unless u have decent/good gear it Will be Hard. Depending on what class u face
---
In my opinion, TBC and eventually WOTLK were continuations of the Vanilla game. Basically Vanilla with lots of QOL, but no fundamentally terrible design flaws introduced.
---
Such an r/classicwow post. Lmao.
---
But if you respec optimally you can clear MC 5 minutes faster!
---
It would make more sense to target it at Wotlk and Hearthstone players since there's far more of them than Classic players.
---
But you know what? This is not a contest of who it was targeted at. It was obviously targeted at all of those groups.
---
They *could* the issue is we only have sharding because modern wow servers are designed in a way to host as many different servers on one machine as possible to minimize costs. If they were willing to pay more for the servers sharding would not be necessary. So yeah if the question is if they are willing to cut back on profits .... I do not think so.
---
&gt; Will there be summoning stones at instances?
---
No. In Classic they were still just Meeting Stones and had no summon functionality. That was only added in TBC.
---
&gt; Will there be AH/bank at every capital?
---
Yes, even though in Vanilla there was a time where the only Auction Houses (besides the Goblin ones) were in IF and OG, Classic will start with the Patch 1.12. state in that regard.
---
&gt; Will BGs/honor system be at launch or at a later phase?
---
Honor System and Rank Rewards in Phase 2, Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley in Phase 3, Arathi Basin in Phase 4.
---
&gt; How many servers will there be?
---
We don't know yet.
---
&gt; I can't group up with mates on another server, right?
---
That is correct. You will only able to group up with people that are on the same server as you.
---
no its definitly not.
---
that would imply they didnt change / fix anything from now till release
---
People keep ignoring something crucial with what I said. Something very important. I already said to join a guide with set raid times. You will benefit from this more then being a casual who logs on thinking hes going to pug raids.
---
I'm saying Casual players wont be able to raid. You wont be able to just choose a day at random, find a group and clear bosses. That's what I'm getting at.
---
I'm being downvoted by people who probably never played vanilla wow and I'm killing their hype. But I'm just laying out what made the game fun. Community.
---
Ahh that's a shame, though I guess it at least means I'll get to see more horde victories than I would if it was the older version. Horde win/loss on that is terrible :(
---
Hahaha wow - its like the forgot one of the most basic principles of an RPG. Players need to feel they are growing in strength.
---
I guess it could be worse - mobs could scale with Item Score or w/e it is now days.
---
Re downloaded the Blizzard launcher after not playing for almost 3 years, I was really happy to be able to switch the game version from retail to Classic.
---
31/0/20 is fine for healing raids
---
Tankning is not Hard in dungeons as long as u have a competent group even as arms/fury. Just slap on a 1h and shield and u should be good to go. Engi Will prob be able to make money as long as ur efficient but a mage Will be good to have as am alt IF u have an insane amount of time ;p
---
Welcome to Blizzard World!
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
From there you can find addons for classic wow.
---
Yeah, I'm sure he brought his kids along to sign a contract.
---
I read the title as "Don't join a dungeon if your game subscription is about to run out"
---
But I agree with you OP.
---
I personally enjoyed quite a few of the tier 2.5 sets no one ever talks about maybe because the stats were bad?
---
Very big deal! Any guild worth their salt won’t let you into a pre-made bg as a male Tauren. You’d be lucky to get into any raids. Can you even imagine trying to click on ragnaros or ony over a huge lumbering male Tauren?
---
The thing that made hybrid specs ande classes shine in Classic was the fact that respeccing cost a lot so it made people consider their builds more. If you could just switch all the time it would ruin a lot of what made hybrids so great.
---
Same, dagger rogue is just as good (speccing for aq &amp; Naxx too tho)
---
Dont forget that blizz/activision is a subscription based company publicly traded. Microtransactions are good for them yes. But recurring revenue is at the core of their valuation and what their owners care about - the expected valuation of Classic could be a massive boost to the value of activison/blizz (Usually SaaS based companies can in very simple terms be put as Monthly Recurring Revenue times factor X). Some unit economics to consider that will talks a lot in favor of classic:
---
**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** is very low for classic since they already have the community and a lot of users resubbing with close to no marketing done.
---
**Lifetime value (LTV):** Classic takes a long time, and potentially makes subs stay subbed for longer, we dont know their plans for after classic yet, but the LTV for each classic sub might be well above current retail
---
**Churn:** All saas based companies want their churn to be as low as possible. how do you lower churn in Blizz case? "Im burnt out of retail - oh look another fun game to play in the universe i love, let me check that out instead of terminating my sub" -&gt; this can be huge impact for the financials at Blizz, doesnt matter if its retail or Classic.
---
Dhud, xperl (zperl), titanbar, and. bartender at the least. Dhud might be icehud or might never get an update
---
Have a warlock and summon your replacement ;)
---
Don’t even dream about getting accepted into even a casual pvp guild as a male tauren Druid.
---
Of course it's designed with costs in mind (like literally everything on this world), but also to avoid dead servers after 2 month when the majority will stop playing.
---
My first reroll was at lvl20 when my raiding friends told me there was no need for rogues in PVE because there are too many. I rerolled as a priest. 
---
Second character change was when I got to lvl53 as a priest and my raiding friends in the guild told me I'd need to respec Holy to join them in MC and Ony. I respecced Holy and tried to quest in WPL and got destroyed by a warrior who I could have flattened as shadow spec. I logged out and levelled my rogue 20-60 and got a raid spot regardless.
---
If anyone ever tells you that they are, show 'em this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvb8MwvsD4
---
They have a brutally high skill cap in PVP and can be awesome tanks in PVE, great healers, viable DPS and bring lots of utility in PVE, and always remember:
---
Cat is for fite!
---
And you need that 5 minute faster clear so that you have more time to farm gold to pay for you respec!
---
Maybe have one or multiple emplacement that everyone must capture ? The winner is the faction that control it after 2 hours ?

"he's not attacking, lets ignore him"
---
 I saw Chris Metzen at a grocery store in Los Angeles. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  
---
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
Back in retail vanilla, I remember hunters doing hard pulls in dungeons, so they could use feign death if more than what was intended got pulled. Was this common on private servers?
---
I will find a guild who will take me to raids as Arms warrior. I cannot be in a super hardcore one because of work anyway.
---
How you gonna gear it?
---
And you can compare a real life object with an ingame mechanic and still be an asshole in online forums.
---
Can mages farm well without frost talents?
---
It was but It had to be what BC talents were already released in the prepatch.
---
Haven't touched any private servers since 2016, but I'd say so, yes.      
---
Not super common, but it happened every now and then - especially on riskier pulls.
---
The [github](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/Bartender4) page from the guy behind Bartender indicates that it's planned for Classic. No info whether it will be available on launch though.

Most of it cannot be dispelled, but in any case, if a Priest sits there spamming Dispel Magic, that just makes it easier for me to kill them. They'll get a few off, but that's why you use useless buffs to protect the important ones.

I actually saw Chris Metzen at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in  person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” 
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and  going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without  paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to  pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the  counter.
---

* I'm in Europe now, but in November I plan to move to Philippines. What server I should choose? Is it possible to change it?
---
* How the F do you download it? There was no version selection for me, only the "Try Free" button. It started downloading WoW. I paused it. The window changed so there's now "Version" dropdown, but it doesn't contain classic. And there's no option to cancel the download. Only to pause it.
---
* I've played WoW only on a private server in like 2010, and I never reached end game. Just leveled a bunch of stuff. I wanna come into this without watching guides and doing analysis, just make it as fresh and new as possible. But I'm worried about raids/dungeons. I wanna learn them on the go and let it be my fresh experience, but that means I will suck and fail a lot. And unlike leveling, that actually effects everyone in the group. What is the minimal way of spoiling myself but not being dead weight?
---
But raiding is the norm..
---
What's the strategy? Cone of Cold &amp; frost Nova etc?
---
I've been away from the beta progress the last 1+ month. Is all the hunter bugs fixed yet?
---
Nightfall and at the start of the fight, Annihilator as well. That one will reduce armor on the target, if you put that on a shaman and 2-3 warriors you'll stack it to its max and have more threat for your MT very fast, then you swap to Nightfall and go.
---
WF/GoA Totem Twisting is really nice. Enhance with enough gear can go Enhance/Elemental which deals ok-ish damage and does a ton of support, especially if you have 4 well geared Fury warriors.
---
Having a Resto totem twist will make him run OOM very quickly, and Mana tide is not that good once you've got a bit of gear.
---
And yes, Enhancement just has go for hybrid gear. They absolutely bring a lot to the group, and even if they don't bring 100% Nightfall uptime, no one does on their own. Have your OTs when they're not doing anything bring a NF as well and you've got even more uptime.
---
I'll gladly invite 1 dedicated Enhancement Shaman who knows his stuff. My melee DPS will thank them by bringing in even bigger parses, and we've got some more utility.
---
Hey guys. Do you know how much will classic wow cost by blizzard official?
---
Thank you
---
You will never be able to tell if someone subscribed only for Classic or for Retail. So if Calssic has like 5M Players, they can say Retail has 5M Players...
---
What is that weapon called? My shaman had it too.
---
Min/Maxing is never 'Needed' in anything but if I'm going to put a lot of time into a game I feel passionate about I am going to try and get the most out of it because that's what I like to do.
---
Only the real tryhards are doing different speccs. Just get a Specc that is great for both PvE and PvP.
---
It only requires a subscription, the same one as retail, which is $15/mo when paid 1 month at a time. Less if paying more than one month at a time
---
*"Look, I can do math!"*
---
Is it likely that alot of current Addons will work on Classic?
---
I think Assasination is even preferred when duo’ing over combat, I at least had great fun with it on a pserver recently. The roles were simple: My friend took aggro and I provided gank protection
---
Heh, I full expect this to happen.  Its part of vanilla charm warts and all.  Also why warlocks are so popular.
---
You don't have to buy any game.
---
All that is needed is pre-paid game time or a subscription to WoW.
---
So €13 or $15 a month.
---
Thank you. 
---
Do I need to pay game + subscription as well? Or only subscription and game will be free?
---
Thank you.
---
Thank you dude !
---
It's not about classic being profitable. It's about Classic acting as a waiting room for live while there are content droughts like once you've finished the new rep grind, got your zone flying and all your "bis" gear for whatever you want. Blizz has a major issue atm with people coming in for a month, finishing the content and then ditching after, resulting in dead subs. Classic involves alot more back to back character farming and grinding so people invest alot more effort into them and are less likely to ditch their subs. 
---
Expect that content patches for Live are designed to fall inbetween phases for classic and vice versa so they can maximise sub length/long term purchases. It's a clever strategy and fully expected from Blizz. They aren't doing classic for your benefit or they'd make it free for outdated content OR make it a seperate sub at a lower rate.
---
Are sl locks strong during the leveling phase up to 60?
---
Why isn't the boomkin aura not seen as more diserable in raids.  Seems that the mage dps increase might make bringing one along worth sacrificing the dps one person.  Or at least offset it a bit.
---
I had to update the launcher and restart before it popped up for me.
---
This is some amazing fan fiction.
---
Depends how close they get to the group before the FD. Also FD has a chance to resist.
---
Haha, cool man! I smiled while reading it. Can only imagine him pulling that voice!

All shared across layers.

AMD Quad core A10-5750M, 16GB ddr3, AMD radeon HD 8970M 2GB GDDR5 VRAM, 1 TB sata 7200 rm. Will I be able to run it?

Retail has microtransactions but requires far more work. Classic is basically copy &amp; paste (including the networking problems to solve).
---
Holy Paladin to Resto Druid in late TBC. Was enchanted by Tree Form, loved the trees moved slower and you couldn’t see what spell they were casting as they were instants. Made the change and loved it. Was a healing monster rolling Lifebloom’s on tanks and spamming downranked Regrowth on the raid.
---
I'll go Warrior. I'll tank the shit out of the Raids until I have what I want. Then I can spec less into Prot and keep tanking Dungeons until I have the last itsy bitsy piece. Then I go PvP.
---
Do you know any good places to farm as warr?
---
Idk I kinda prefer Shaman T1, except for the helmet.
---
Better than playing BFA
---
Are you a priest?
---
It helps but not enough to compensate for how much less they bring otherwise + they'l be competing for items with your casters while adding a lot less to the raid per new item.
---
&gt;You only need a few elite players to carry your DPS unless you're aiming for world firsts.
---
And a dozen other people that are happy being essentially useless lmfao
---
Real life darkmoon faire

Woops, sorry! But thanks!

Ask if he can come back and destroy all of actis corruption at blizz.

Weird that you spent time thinking about meeting him. I mean I love Tom Savinis work. When I saw him I freaked out...but I had never spent one moment thinking about meeting him.
---
Anticipate neckbeard drama when you tell the 120dps boomkin he's not pulling his weight lmfao

Only video settings if I remember correctly

id like to see buyable mounts and a level 55 character boost

“Thank you warrior” how does it feel to have the literal best thing ever happen to you?

Blizzard pls

Yes

You mean wrath of the lich king?

Activision would never hire him.

Ill use notting except thottbot.
---
If you fix your car, is it a different one?

I’ve seen this before but it was Tony Hawk

thats the spirit right there :D
---
If you dont play like 12 hours a day or more it will take you 20 days.
---
Curse client doesn't even exist anymore. They've now been bought by Twitch. You can get addons via the Twitch client.
---
The time to get to max lvl is part of the allure of classic, sit back and enjoy the world they built!
---
Not for EU non-Beta people. I only got access to this a couple of days ago.
---
Won’t use addons for questing. Takes the fun out of it for me
---
20 days /played is still 20 days /played, no matter how much you play?
---
Shaman t2&gt;t3 big time brother.
---
He gave a hooker a blowjob for some hard drugs, and he was never the same after that. 
---
His cousin Trall was never as good either...
---
No game will ever fix "all bugs". Are Hunters playable? Very much so.
---
Wow you should not play this.
---
I will, i had that or a similar in vanilla. #nochanges right?
---
It's over a decade since I last saw that. Reminds me of all the old WoW machinima from back then.
---
[I used to love Unlimited Escapism... It's pretty weird, and long, now. ](https://youtu.be/0H9X9QktjPk)
---
Pvp gear isn't as focused on damage as prebis gear is, but i went and checked, you'll have ~23.5% crit unbuffed in prebis p1, assuming full prebis. 40% is possible fully buffed. 5% from rallying, 5.75% from songflower, 1.25% from blasted lands flask, 3.25% from mongoose and 0.5% from motw.
---
=~23.5% + 15.75
---
If you had a feral or more crit specialised gear, then p1 40% is achievable, with 30% being very close with just consumes.
---
Sadly I don't yet. It's on my to-do list. :)
---
Shame we could use more druids out there
---
Remember asking for legacy realms since 1 week into Cata, met with wall of nop but man does it feel good to finally have it come to fruition
---
(Not because I didnt like Cata mind you, heroic's in Cata were amazing and had early cata (pre 4.2) been what retail is right now, I genuinelly believe retail would still be at 8+million subs)
---
I got an orc rogue to 60 and raided ZG and got the Zulian Slicer off Hakkar in my first run.  It was fucking fun.  All I could think about the entire 23 days /played on that toon though was experiencing it legitimately and it’s fucking happening in less than 11 work days.  I can’t sleep now.
---
HOLY SHIT A FUCKING REPLY.... IN 1 DAY... 
---
##WOW
---
FD can resist? Classic really is an emotional Rollercoaster.
---
Is there any official statement or sign that blizzard might take ro pvp servers in consideration contrary to what blizz stated before?
---
LFD AND LFG WERE FINE *BEFORE THEY AUTO ADDED YOU TO A GROUP*
---
THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS NOT A BIG PROBLEM AT ALL.
---
Source?
---
I've been waiting for BC since they announced classic, SCRUB!!!!
---
Not really, because its more than likely you already have a subscription if you are looking at the WoW BFA Launcher.
---
Anything that makes the Journey easier. I don't play for the Journey, but the end stuff.
---
Warlock to 60 (main in vanilla), priest to 60, mage to 60, rerolled Druid main at 70 in tbc, all of them leveld to cap, new expansion new main all to cap.  
---
Rinse repeat upto BFA, now sitting with every class at 120 (except rogue and DH).   
---
  
---
Might run a shaman or hunter in classic both would be awesome. Or perhaps rogue since i never mained one (i did alot of PvP upto wotlk, with around 250.000HK on warlock, and i haaaated rogues and didnt roll one mostly out of spite)
---
It does for me too but depends on the games. I loved AC Origins and Odyssey without any kind of ui, quest markers and such. Odyssey even had exploration mode so you had to listen to quest givers and find your way on your own.
---
But in wow, I already know every damn quest so why not make it less an effort.
---
I am however gonna use that RP quest addon that makes talking to NPCs more like traditional rpgs.
---
I am genuinely curious though... all the people that say that you should just enjoy exploring and what not, if this is their first time in vanilla or if they already know all the quests already.
---
I say this as alliance I already know pretty much every quest in the game and where it is and I didn't play on private servers (thought 1-40 on the beta helped).  Sure there are some one offs and such but I'm curious to know the population split on this.
---
&gt;You can't really blame blizzard if they sold out to the epic store, can you?
---
True. I’m sure blizzard knows what they’re doing and I’m not sure why I’m so invested in them advertising for this game... but I’m really surprised they haven’t been doing pre-video ads on YouTube at the least.
---
Any 40 human players
---
During the pre-launch test, I’m planning on playing with a friend. If we choose the same server we still have a chance of not spawning on the same layer.
---
How would I invite my friend to my layer?
---
If EverQuest p99 and the pretentious players that speak private server elite gospel have anything to say about it...
---
That is incorrect
---
Don't think I got time to make an alt to 60, if classic was released a few years ago I would have made xclass + mage, and I would use the mage for farming and bgs, slowly making rank every week and then give the mage 1 month so I can get to rank 10.
---
It does affect cast time.
---
I've played so much in vanilla, I don't think I'll need questie anymore and "forgetting" everything unfortunately does not work.
---
Yep
---
I've never really been a fan of SL, since you're more than tanky enough to deal with almost any scenario while still also have the monumental burst of SM Ruin.  
---
Though once I hit BWL/AQ gear levels, I'll likely start respeccing to NF/Conflag for PvP.
---
We already do, it's called retail WoW.
---
I played until end of cata, came back in bfa. I'm curious, do GMs still show themselves to you in game if you ask them to during five chat in game? I always thoroughly enjoyed that part of a gm ticket.
---
Same. I previously used a questing addon and it really did take away a lot of the RPG feeling. Honestly, if you know how to read the quests then you can work out how to do most of the quests pretty easy anyway.
---
As a shaman, I always set my hearth to the town/zone im leveling in b/c of astral recall.
---
Essentially unlimited hearthstones!
---
When at 60, either org, under city or kargath depending on what I plan to be doing.
---
Ain't in a guild yet, but I will be looking for a guild that doesn't raid Sunday, so I'll have like 3-4 days for pvp and the rest for pve.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong, but Berserking works on spell cast time as well as melee.
---
You could have just googled it instead of bitching
---
It's literally just
---
`/invite friend`
---
Thank you for the discussion, guys. I appreciate it greatly!
---
No
---
Overwatch has a map called blizzard world which is essentially a blizzard theme park
---
Heard that anything that isn't combat is weak in pve for rogues. A pvp spec for rogue has at least 21 points in subtlety for preparation, and I heared they all suck.
---
Sir what about world pvp while leveling? Are sl locks strong in random encounters? Obviously if I'm jumped I'm fucked but when I can get an even Match, how well will I do? At what level do we start wrecking in pvp?
---
Dont play this game.
---
I'm rolling 0/30/21 on my Druid and 30/0/21 on my Shaman. Both are excellent specs for PvP and will heal in PvE just fine. Not really concerned about min-maxing because I don't have the time to go heavily into raiding anyway. My end-game goals with both classes is the Tier 0.5 set.
---
How is giantstalker on that list
---
Was he at Disney for the pedophilia stuff or did you not ask?
---
&gt; I hope your work load is a little less extreme these days.
---
It is but I have kids now too so I work more at home than I do at work.
---
I still have the Classic Beta installed (but never played it). Does that automatically transform to the full Classic client or do I have to uninstall it and reinstall it again? Don't wanna have any unnecessary installation work shortly before launch.
---
I hadn't even thought about this. I should try making an EU account now and see how the ping is...
---
$37
---
Well the smoke breaks wont be a problem anymore...
---
Cheers.
---
Or have a wife?
---
I'll also be rolling a warrior and I'll 100% be leveling fishing and cooking as I level. I'm not in a rush to 60 so fishing, cooking, herb and alch really add to the immersion of the warrior class for me. I think it's awesome to buff myself with the consumables I made.
---
Hunter T2 Dragonstalker imo
---
Im pretty sure you dont need a sub to post on the official classic forums
---
I went looking for anything on this, but found nothing. Could you please provide a source for your claims?
---
I was my guild's main tank, so ended up doing jail break dozens of times when we were working towards Onyxia. I hated it every time.
---
Yes you can. I would advise you hide below decks. I don't think there are guards on the boats in vanilla.
---
for me its about of impactful each of my abilities feel. in vanilla you generally see a nice chunk of the enemy's hp dissapear when you use an ability on them compared to retail where you spam 5 abilities to see their hp move. And with the introduction of resilience a few abilities started to not feel good using
---
I need level 10 tho
---
Not selling that much at the start.
---
&gt;Yes....it was players that asked to have classes stripped of all character in order to play 3 button whackamole....
---
This is exactly why but you should not listen to players.
---
The game has become too complicated to play
---
- synergies
---
- where you build up this
---
- have to wait for that
---
- react to this with that if this is the case
---
- otherwise react to this with this if that is the case
---
- and then id something is the case then you have to react with this or that depending on this or that
---
- interspersed with random appearance of this or that you have to react to
---
People complained that the game was too easy to play, and so blizzard retarded it up. 
---
- paladin's should not have holy power
---
- warlock should not have soul shard power
---
- arcane power
---
- Shadow power
---
- astral power
---
Remove them all.
---
And get rid of the synergies.
---
Cataclysm was so awful with introduction of all this nonsense that I nearly quit. It was just terrible. And the comically worst one of the bunch, if I can remember correctly, was a hunter talent:
---
&gt; if a Target is marked with your Hunter Mark,  and the target has less than 20% health, and the target begins to flee, and you use your kill command within five seconds, you have a 50% chance to have 30% of the mana of Kill Command refunded
---
It was so bad that you need a huge UI to pop up around your character indicating that **something** has happened, and you have to press **something** else.
---
Or you need an encyclopedia to keep track of all the synergies between spells. *(no don't use that ability yet, use this ability, and then use that ability and then when this ability does that then you can use that ability)*
---
In Cataclysm Blizzard just said they were responding to requests from the community to make the game more difficult to play.
---
Fuck alllll of that.
---
- you have your health bar
---
- and you have your Mana/focus/ rage/chi bar
---
And you cast your spells. If you cast them too fast you run out of mana and be useless. 
---
Only rogues get to keep their combo points.
---
------
---
The last thing I need is Blizzard listening to people claiming the game is too easy.
---
Go with your heart, not with your mind.  You'll be happier that way.
---
That's the best part.
---
Buy gold
---
&gt; Because a lot of a that feedback is down to raids, where druids are indeed less desirable    
---
&gt;Lying to people about the viability of their character would be incredibly unfair. 
---
Aaaaand thanks for showing my point.
---
Where do we lie when we do say that druids are viable as 40 mans tanks? Where do we lie as saying that druids and paladins are viable as 5 and 20 mans? This has been done again and again. You're the only disturbing / lying factor here.
---
&gt;**If that means there's going to be less tanks for 5man runs that is sad but still preferable to someone putting several weeks into a character only to find themselves unwanted or unable to perform.**
---
This is why I'm angry at the likes of you the most. THIS IS A FU\*KING GAME, WHERE TONS OF THINGS ARE VIABLE (=/= optimal). JUST LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE, STOP SCARYING THEM FOR NOTHING, FFS. Just look at what you do with all those people posting "is X viable / can I play this / will I be skilled enough to tank one day / ...". This is not right.
---
Damn it, freaking arrogant anti-game anti-rpg elitists. Just hope this game quickly goes out so casuals won't have a reason to go to forums and risk read your BS.
---
Imagine LARP Raids....i would not want to be a tank
---
Smh it's always the fucking paladins
---
get adoptions so you can raid harder
---
And Kilrogg too!!!!
---
Which class has the best designed race/class fantasy and why is it not the paladin?
---
You don't need to powershift to do competitive dps :)
---
can blizz remove the -2019 part, please!!!!
---
I second this, all the classes have the opportunity to completely change the game and make lasting impacts on everyone around you, of your heart is in it, it's going to be a great ride no matter the class.
---
Came here to post this, you too!?
---
This gave me hots
---
You probably wanna be 30+ to do that so pvp isn't an issue, and at that lvl you can just get the fp in arathi and then move down, IMO that is easier.
---
Yeah. I hate not being able to find quests.
---
That, plus the fact that it is very hard to develop 2 mmos at the same time, and the fact that it is not wise for any company to compete with themselves, makes "classic plus" very unlikely.
---
The best thing we can eventually get is optional BC servers
---
Troll is better especially for casters but for healers its not huge.
---
Idk, I do think telling people that if they invest 3 months getting to 60 they'll easily be able to find raid slots as any class/spec and be competitive actually is pretty dangerous.
---
No no you still have 3 more years
---
12% crit on a party doesn't offset boomer dps.
---
Oh that’s just modern wow.
---
I remember watching it on Twitch. The chat was going absolutely insane. And I'm glad I can say that I WAS THERE Pog
---
Druid it is
---
Just because Classic will launch without a cash shop, it doesn't mean that Blizzard won't add it down the line? Why do you think they're releasing the game using such a modern client?
---
anyone know how many realms we get??
---
Nope.
---
I am in no rush to 60.  I am just going to be chilling, doing some quests, a lot of harvesting, a lot of fishing, a lot of cooking and just taking my time traveling around Azeroth.
---
I will just be sticking to hotbar/UI addons.
---
How big is it??
---
There’s already classic addons on curse
---
Depends who you are fighting and stuff. But yeah if you have no cooldowns you are kinda screwed, but luckily you have so many of them, just don't waste them all on one fight.
---
It is true for casual guilds. Just not for your elitist / speedrunning / top servers player base, which represents nothing on the big picture.
---
Be aware, Windows 10 makes some wonky stuff with two screens of different resolutions. Scaling and blurring issues.
---
check the rules to the right especially number 4.
---
We often refer to Blizzard world (the overwatch map) as Blisneyworld. With the rumor of Disney being interested in purchasing them, it made this inside joke hilarious.
---
Not every boss is in the path to the final boss, or gives good loot for anyone in the party.
---
I love how excited you are. I am too.
---
Regarding the Toxicity I'll handle it a different way than on live right now, because some will need to learn that's not how Classic goes.
---
I'll have my Ignore List (with Addon so I can add reasons n stuff) and basically have people light-ignored where I would cleanse their Ignore after a week or so. People who go beyond the acceptable of course will stay there.
---
yup
---
You kinda can if you don't let them see you. Just like in wow.
---
&gt; Are BGs going to be cross realm?
---
1. There was cross-realm bgs in 1.12.
---
2. They've confirmed it a bunch of times e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bokglg/cross_realm_battlegrounds_confirmed/)
---
If you wanna test it there is a stress test on the 8th
---
What you describe in the second paragraph is not going to happen since we're getting megaservers + sharding. You won't be able to randomly meet the same bunch of people over and over.
---
I went to Disneyland for free, and I wouldn’t go again even if it was free🤣
---
The only one to write shitty post titles?
---
by not joining
---
close to the same number of hours if you take 1-3 hours, just less rested xp
---
Cross realms were in 1.12 and saved pvp, so dont know why you are disappointed.
---
10 days of /played is average. If you are good at questing and don't fuck around 6-7 days /played depending on class.  You can do math.
---
It's in the non-sub launcher too. In terms of advertisment, I think we must take what we get. ;)
---
Naxx is in the base game and pretty big in lore, dude
---
~ 3 weeks real time if you level at an average pace
---
I completely forgot about this ability. My memory is really starting to go. I slept so much downtime in OG harassing people as my owl.

For which class and spec? Vanilla speed can very much depend on these. A Protection Warrior vs. Hunter etc.
---
Wives can be reasoned with, at least most wives. You can't reason with a 1 year old who had a bad dream.
---
Started in late 2006, as big a noob as can be imagined, 36yrs old and first PC game. Rolled Dwarf Hunter because the opening cinematic hooked me and because my friend was NE hunter. Mained him all the way to 70 and raided Kara on him. Loved that toon. Had alts to play around on but that hunter was boss. Hell I kept the same snow leopard pet from level 10 all the way. Sure I had others but that was my pet. And then I started getting more hard core and things changed. My hunter became my farmer mid BC. 
---
Rolled a rogue because their DPS was simply insane and I was doing more PVP so that became my main through last half of BC. I rolled a War because I wanted to tank and did so in LK when DPS became an aoe no CC no skill bore. Rolled a priest because I wanted to heal but by Cata I was maining a holy pally and my War. Mists was where The obsession started to drop off. 
---
I’ve re-upped my sub for each new expansion because I love the lore but after LK and LFG the community started to die so it became a solo questing game on my Warrior just to play through the story. 
---
I am soooo looking forward to classic because it will be the game I remember but still new since I started late. Never been on a server where the gates are not open. Never been a part of the war effort. Wasn’t involved in the scourge invasion really. It will be so nice to know how to play and what to do while still seeing and experiencing the game New again. Hell when me and my bud were playing back then we had no idea what those swirly entrances were and why stuff on the other side was sooo damn hard to kill. Uldaman was hours of fun with two noob hunters having no idea we were in a 5 man dungeon lol. 
---
I’m completely Horde now and I’m not sure what class I want to main yet. Leaning Druid, Lock or Rogue. My first login will be on a Dwarf hunter though because why the hell not. 
---
If you read this far I have a funny story from those early days when WOW and my hunter were my life. Logged in one day and my Snow Leopard (Smoke) was GONE!!!!! Couldn’t summon him and spent an hour trying to figure out the hell happened. It hit me like a RL pet had ran away; I was crushed. Logged out extremely pissed and logged back in a while later and there it was. It was the same emotion as opening your front door after you think your pet has ran away and there it is on the porch waiting for you. THAT is the level of feeling this game can produce. Crazy!!!
---
I'm testing heartbeat and diminishing returns.
---
Looking for someone to level to 8 and duel me ~20 times so I can record how long a first and second fear lasts.
---
Would love a remake of WotA. Best books i've read so far
---
I started out as a NE druid and struggled hard.  Got her to around level 20 and said no more.  Rerolled as a human warlock and it just clicked.  Played her until Wrath.
---
i think private servers got the shadow resistance on bosses wrong, because you are partly right they did do less damage
---
Where's the pserver part of this myth? 
---
It's as old as time and warlocks aren't any better on pservers.
---
It's true for casual guilds that will get hardstuck in bwl after taking a year to clear MC with a dozen pugs and then disband.
---
In reality, there's a gradient beyond the simple black and white "Oh only the top .5% of guilds will care about specs/gear/enchants/consumables/rotations". And there *will* be whingeposting on this sub and the forums when 6 months after release the "casual" playerbase discovers that there actually is a general expectation to meet a certain level of net benefit for the groups you join.
---
Roflmao
---
Long-winded answer, incoming. Tl;Dr is to play what you identify with best and what makes you feel best to play rather than focus on min maxing and dont worry so much about the "downsides" unless you just absolutely hate them mechanically.
---
I have been an altoholic since I first played this game. I have mained every single class at one point, or another.
---
I would make excel sheets to calculate which class was best based on the utility they had, how much I enjoyed the class theme, how strong they were in pvp (and later, mythic+), and tons of other criteria.
---
I drove myself mad, and admittedly, I know my friends grew tired of me swapping mains every couple of weeks.
---
I had always mained Horde, as that's what my friends played. I never got into the tropes of the Horde as much as my friends did, and I found myself having more fun on my Alliance alts/servers.
---
I ended up deciding that I needed to play what faction I identified with more in general. I could see the struggles of the Horde throughout the timeline of the games, but I felt more connected to the Alliance themes and general motivations.
---
Recently, after a break, I came back, started playing Alliance, and had swapped to a capped druid I had. My thought was, hey, they can literally do every role, they have stealth, travel form, whats not to love? I played druid for a few weeks, and though I love the theme of the specs, i just didnt find them fun to play.
---
I thought, okay, I mostly pug, want to be able to solo achievements since I like soloing a lot of the time, and man, I need that rep bonus for humans. I ended up rolling a warlock and capping it, got it to almost the level my druid was in a fraction of the time. 
---
As cool as I found each of the warlock specs, I just couldn't identify as much with a class that everyone considers evil. I know warlocks arent all  evil, but everyone assumes they are. As silly as that may sound to others, it bothered me. (Dont get me wrong, I love my lock, just not as my main). I found myself talking to my guildies I'd been with since I swapped to Alliance this expac about class choice.
---
"Why did you pick human warlock, a pure dps class, if you like helping people in a more direct way, and you also prefer non-human races, generally?"
---
And I told them it was because i wanted to be human for the reputation bonus, and warlocks were some of the best soloers, and I liked the three specs, even if they weren't my favorite. 
---
But I also told them, "Honestly, if I could be human on them, I'd play a shaman." I told them that without having to think about it. I have ALWAYS known that shaman specs were the coolest, to me, animation-wise. I love the themes of healing with water, using totems for utility, feeling like a swiss army knife, being able to thunderstorm in pvp to send people flying. And, shaman is the class I identify with most, as a person in the real world. I am heavily into Norse mythology and culture, and I love helping people and being self reliant no matter which spec I play.
---
As I told them that, the o ly thing keeping me from being a shaman main is that it couldn't be human. And I thought,isnt that kind of the worst kind of min-max logic? Sure, I feel a bit less efficient having to grind a little more rep. 
---
But, MAN, have I enjoyed myself so much since I changed to shaman. I love everything about it. Even down to being blue as a class color. Yes, there are things I will miss from other classes, but that is the nature of mmos with many classes.
---
I feel at home on the shaman, despite the little shortcomings I may feel, infrequently. I no longer even think about being inefficient, since it is FINALLY so fun to play the game. And that's the point, right?
---
I love being able to off heal, use the elements, see cool animations all the time, have so much utility, etc. I love being a dwarf since they are part of Norse mythology and make me FEEL like a shaman.
---
I'm finally not worried about minmaxing, or catching up on alts. I did manage to make a short list of classes I would like to cap at some point, but since I swapped to Shaman, I no longer feel like I need to play other classes to fill the void.
---
My guild will be going Horde in classic. So I willbe going Tauren shaman to feel close to nature. Yea, I may not be the best, yes, I may have to heal in pve, may have to heal or ele in pvp.... but I'm so okay with that.
---
If you read this whole thing, thank you. I know what it is like struggle with choice and decision.
---
Puck the class you feel at home on, that you identify with, for whatever your reasons are, and the rest will fall in place. Best of luck!
---
resets. That's how they all work, I don't think anything suspends the swingtimer until like WotlK.
---
Yeah well, can't blame them for being confused, when listening to the community was part of the reason that the game went downhill, was it? I also think it's shameful to accuse them of not listening to their community anymore, as that's basically all how Classic WoW comes about
---
I saw Chris Metzen at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
---
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
That’s just not true. I recall hearing an interview with one of the lead devs from 2005 where they said they projected 1 million subs worldwide after the first year. That’s still a big underestimate but not as big as you suggest.
---
I've been waiting since Cata pre-patch. Not actively, but definitely passively. I think virtually all of us have.
---
My favorite game (Vanilla-Mid Wotlk) was ripped from my hands and mutated into something else...
---
In other words, I never really stopped playing WoW, it was taken from me.
---
You have one! Retail

Most likely the sequel will be funded by a Chinese company because the movie was very popular in China

Also the movie made some money through merchandise sales
---
What happens at a pre launch test, is this open beta?
---
Just curious as a fellow shaman, what spec are you going?
---
My bad. You’re right, I didn’t understand your situation. My apologies.
---
lol, kinda depends... NE druids (and Tauren most likely, though I've never played Horde) also seem pretty on point with race/class fantasy. I dunno, hard to get a "factual" answer when this is pretty subjective...!
---
final stress test for all that have live will be the 8th I think
---
They've done a ton of advertising, it was just all aimed at twitch zoomers. They are apparently the target audience now.
---
Yeah I probably won't ignore players unless they are just spamming nonsense or pming me non stop for no reason but I imagine my ignore list will be full of gold sellers and the odd spamming player who spams about selling dungeon runs or raid runs.
---
It affects spell casts but not damage over time and channeled abilities.
---
Or maybe we’re the ones who are out of touch.
---
It's a strange thing to come to these subs and see people claim naxx geared warlocks are amazing damage because I remember as a lock that basically we were only brought along for curse of elements, soulstones and imp buffs. There would be two or three per 40 man. 
---
I did great damage but I was pretty decked out compared to everyone else. 
---
All that aside I'm looking forward to seeing how well they perform with the benefit of time and hindsight.
---
Ok, do you feel better now?
---
Because how do I know that these specs are less viable? Because I tanked a pally back in retail vanilla and in TBC and on my alt on a private server, and because I played feral tank druid for my main alt class (yes, in raids too) and tank warrior for my main class on several private servers. I have also played together with very dedicated feral druids as part of our offtank team through AQ40 and into Naxx and even they could not fully    
---
I am familiar with the weaknesses (and advantages) of these specs through first hand experience and the truth is simply that feral druid has weaknesses in itemisation, performance, effort requirement etc. when it comes to raids. Yes, many guilds will bring one and thus they will be represented in far fewer numbers than (tank) warriors. Protection paladin just has massive problems all over the board. A lot of people are already aware of these weaknesses and were aware of those back in the day and they will notice those weaknesses in classic.
---
Just saying "it is a game, let people play what they want" isn't an option. If people ask if their class choice is viable they are getting the truth. Protection paladin is NOT viable, no matter how you try to put it, and feral druid will not be viable in raids for anyone who is not able to put in the effort to make it viable and set themselves apart in the competition for feral druid raid spots.  
---
Again, if someone is interested in raiding then they should know the truth about these specs before putting in hundreds of hours. Your preference for role playing and class fantasy does not change that.
---
By the way, my first alt will again be a feral druid because it makes for a relaxing tank in 5mans and I will also take it into our alt/pug raids as an offtank. It will be doing alright but it won't be performing to a level that I'd expect of any main and it won't be doing any main tanking. But it will receive barely any loot (because there isn't any) and it will be severely hamstrung by not being a high pvp rank nor have some of the other ridiculous shit feral druids need to do to get even close to warriors in raid tanking.
---
If you see that as too elitist it can't be helped. But out of the whole raid, tank performance matters most and it'll be very apparent which of the feral druids are actually worth their salt and which should have chosen another class.
---
To find quests in zones where I've seemingly done them all to not miss one, yes.
---
I also like using databases.
---
Don't like arrows that tell you where to go or bubbles on my map, though.
---
Nope. General chat :)
---
I totally forgot, you can lock-pick the UBRS entrance? Or you had to have a key?
---
what db is the best to use while playing?
---
It's not my first time but I've deliberately been avoiding playing Horde so I forgot all the quests.
---
You may be joking but I find myself doing this

tauren, preferably something like tauren or druid.

Well, you'll know when live hits or not, whether it's possible to do anything about nostalgia. But, nostalgia is a longing for something that happened in the past, so it's normal you can "dig it up" and relive it. But, the hope is (mine anyway) that Classic is authentic to Vanilla enough that it allows you to re-experience moments/things in the game that are as evocative and emotional (or if not, not too far off) that allow you to experience similar things again. But, I just don't think we can re-live what we've lived in the past, in part because we are 14 years older, and we may not live things/emotions the same way anymore. That's how it is for me, but the greatness of this game, to me, is worth redoing/reliving; I'm sure it'll be worth it...!
---
Glhf!
---
No, because you can figure out how to do 95% of quests just by reading the objectives. The rest can be made clear by reading the description.
---
There are only a few quests that can be hard to figure out as long as you know what cardinal directions are.
---
And no "Mankrik's wife" isn't one of those quests.
---
PS: I did almost every quest in the game, excluding some class specific quests and a few alliance/horde only (for example horde Ony attument, I never played a warlock,...) And I do remember a lot of them, it's really surprising how good my memory is when it comes to unimportant things.

None ever said minmaxing is needed.

---
It makes sense that a warlock could be on top on bosses like KT if he is affli, since you can just dot everything and not worry about the max debuff problem.
---
I played a warlock on the feenix private server and on our server Warlock were destroying the meters and it was always only locks on top except for the mages who had the ignite rng. It was mostly due to the talents being bugged so that you got an insane ammount of hit % from talents, so you could just skip all hit gear and go full dmg.
---
I dont remember much from dmg meters in retail, except that i played a rogue and it was always mages and rogues on top. I dont know how well the top guilds actually knew their stuff all the way back in retail, but I would imagine some of them did not have the best talents and gear and so on and things could be different this time around.

Questie and this for leveling: https://i.imgur.com/G3Y9E5k.jpg
---
No need to overthink it.
---
When me and my brother first got the game we made a night elf warrior. Don't think he got to more than level 5. 
---
After that I don't remember, but I did have a night elf rogue pretty early on that got to level 30+. A human mage which got to like level ~20, and a human warrior that got to level ~30. Plus a whole bunch of other characters I levelled to 10 or so. The character I finally settled on a few months after we got the game was an Orc warrior which I made on a new servers when I found some friends irl who played there. Then that took like a year to level to 60, at which point TBC was almost out :(
---
What is your favorite way to customize a tauren? I can't decide if I want to do a white tauren with red eyes and be an albino or if I want to be all black. What do you think is the coolest horn style?
---
And I recall 150k.
---
I am also a BC fanboy because I did not start playing until late 2006. BC was where I was finally not a noob with no clue. I’d be fine if they went as far as BC but LK is where the game began to die. LFG killed the community first off. AOE speed runs removed the need for CC and coordinating pulls. BC heroics were actually heroic and you could easily die on trash if you were not smart. Jewel crafting was good IMO and you still had to find books for First Aid and do class quests plus attune for raids. LK is when WOW outgrew itself and started pandering to the “it’s to hard” people. 
---
Go through BC and keep Outland relevant by splitting the time line there. Keep the mechanics keep the level cap at 70. Flying was cool but it would not hurt my feelings if it never came back. Even better allow free flight on your mount but you can only mount your flier at a FP. That way you get the benefit of the flying exploration and speed without the crazy advantage it gives you questing and farming.
---
You could save for https://classicdb.ch/?item=1973

It rerolled many times till I actually capped my character.. . Hunter - &gt;druid - &gt;hunter - &gt;priest - &gt;and finally capped a mage! I was so stupid that I would always delete the character because of nickname... Hh stupid 13y old kid :D

You do all of us did : you either ask your parents for wow or for something else but in reality it's for wow lol

But it is very much alive, the whole package, I made more friends in beta than I made in live since mop. It was seriously freaking amazing, people from everywhere meeting for the first time and becoming friends, seeking them out the next day to continue playing together and whatnot. This is the reason I say it was not enough, that element is missing from the game! And that element is the COMMUNITY 😊
---
You could probably get it working but it’s against the TOS and you could get banned for it
---
Horde is neutral, the alliance is good and the bad guys we fight in raids/dungeons are evil, that is always how I looked at it.
---
Where will be server located in the stress test? It says it's "Global". Do we choose the realm (EU/US/Asia)?
---
Horde are definitely the good guys in Classic.
---
You’ve exposed me

Every time I see a post that begins with "I'm a little drunk" I have to double check to make sure I wasn't the one who wrote it.

I would replace Bonebiter with this:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17730/gatorbite-axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17730/gatorbite-axe) or this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11907/beastslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11907/beastslayer)
---
What is the other addon name
---
I wasn't aware this was happening, but I'd imagine a combination of a) crafting recipes (Crusader comes to mind) and b) showing it can be done made this endeavour pretty worthwhile.
---
Well, there's a direct correlation here. If the servers were small, there really wouldn't be any need for sharding. They could just increase spawnrates for a couple of days and that would fix things during launch. However, the fact that they haven't announced anything about servers plus the fact that we're getting sharding is really suspicious. It looks to me like sharding will always be present and will be enabled at will (when zones get clogged up).
---
It's not worth going gnome over human if you hate their looks and it's especially not worth risking a ban just for a tiny bit more DPS. The difference in PvP is small (since locks generally are on defense perception is a really, really good racial to find stealthed druids going for the flag) and in PvE it's like 0,2% more crit in full Naxx gear as well as like 350 Mana which means you can cast 1 more SB before you have to life tap.
---
Don't worry about failing. Most people won't be gods at the game. And anyway, in dungeons, it just matters if you try. And the more you care and try, the better you will be, it's not really about having a 5Head 200IQ brain knowing all the ins and outs of everything mob, mechanic and fight. As a good MMORPG, WoW teaches you things along the way (as you already know), and the party leader should indeed explain to the group what things to look out for e.g. for boss fights.
---
I would suggest hitting your spells with the keyboard (rather than the mouse), and just trying to care and be attentive to the group, and you will be fine. By the time you hit raids, you should have done enough dungeons (including at lvl 60) to have an idea about how to raid.
---
But seriously, don't worry about skill-level. You will have it if you care about the game. :)
---
I'm not the OP but i really appreciate the sound of your words. You brought to me some lights. :)
---
PRobably battle.net update you dont have or something. I had mine pop up the first hours it started popping up for the first people. And I didnt have beta access or playtime so it has nothign to do with that
---
No, it’s not. Pre-bis still comes from 5-mans, and the hardest part of getting a 5-man team is finding a tank. Even DPS warriors need drops from those dungeons, and a Fury or Arms is more than capable of tanking anything, up to and including UBRS, with a half-decent tank set.
---
Plus there are several raid fights where the DPS warriors still need to put on tank plate for offtanking. Everyone says that’s the hardest part of four horsemen: finding eight geared, competent warriors for tanking the bosses.
---
People are *scared* of tanking.
---
I always washed the cars of my family in exchange for money.

How do u feel about playing ret in vanilla aka respeccing between heal and ret. is it feasable to roll for ret gear when u heal in a raid?

But Charakters will be wiped right? I am asking because I read something about reserving names on servers etc. is a Serverlist available already?
---
Nah, we were well into Naxx before we decided to take time off before TBC.  I remember it painfully, because some of us were already preparing frost sets for Saph when suddenly people started dropping like flies to take time off before TBC.  Didn't help that TBC beta info was starting to show that quest rewards in HFP were on par with a lot of our gear.  Took the wind out of a lot of sails.
---
Our long-time Retadin was pretty happy with his numbers in Naxx when he got to go all out.  He didn't have a problem swapping gear to be a cleanse/heal bot on down fights.  He understood his role and filled it well.
---
I mean that’s really what they’re for...  oh shit/suck this moments in wpvp/raids...
---
Depends on race
---
John Staats in his book says half a million was the upper limit of what they could have expected and even that sounded crazy.
---
I love the lock shadowbolting rats part:)
---
No serverlist is available yet. And yes, characters will be wiped. Character reservation happens a few days after this stress test.
---
If I have the beta client installed do I have to install the other client listed under World of Warcraft Classic tab as well?
---
I was in a top raiding guild back in the day and did like 6 or 7 bosses in Naxx just before BC hit so I can weigh in a little. I was a Warlock within the guild and always did competitive DPS even with putting up curses to help the rest of the raid. Sure we didn't top the meters in all of the fights but we were definitely welcomed in the raids.  
---
Like someone posted in another thread, this concern about classes in raids is a bit overblown, if you raid and are good you will get a spot in a decent guild. If you want to hardcore it then yes you can do that and likely Hunters/Warlocks might not be at the top by Naxx but they do very well in the lead up to Naxx.
---
Personally I think gnome casters look better than their human counterparts
---
No pallies for horde in vanilla man...
---
It sucks because no other game in my mind really compares, so it feels like I've been wandering trying to find a game I enjoy half ad much for years.

That's why I'm playing Alliance in the stress test, lol
---
well let me rephrase and say the major bugs with pet pathing, strafing, autoshot etc.

Yea. After launch week Ill have a couple hours every few days to play. I dont want to log in after waiting to play for 4 days just to be spawn camped by some loser.

All resilience ended up doing was making it so the "ability rotation" types had a clear advantage. It doesn't take skill to remember in what order to kidney shot eye gouge cheap shot and vanish to start it all over again until the target is dead.

When I came at you as my fire mage you had two choices: adapt, or be baptized in flame. You had to make that decision quickly. I made it a literal point to make it so you couldn't use the rotation you googled from an ACTUAL good player on me. It was my skill/instinct vs yours.
---
Resilience completely stripped that. If you watch arena battles post resilience it was a giant borefest of meta rotations until one side made a single mistake or went oom.
---
It's organic versus mechanical.
---
accurate
---
Why would anyone play as a human in a fantasy game? 
---
(It’s a joke, relax min/maxers)
---
Ah so you did, my bad. I got into a kind of ranty mode there right before bed
---
Oh yes, definitely want to agree with you on that one (I say 'want' cuz I haven't played the beta, stress tests or private servers yet...!). It does seem like all the elements are there to re-create the "same" (more or less) experiences that we had 12-14 years ago. I just read your question as though it seemed like you thought you'll never recreate them, despite trying during all of beta, stress tests, etc., and I was trying to respond to that or try to explain it (even though I'm not a psychologist!). But yes, I agree, all the elements should pretty much be there to allow for the recreation of those moments we remember, and so, I hope that as you and the community progresses, we re-create some of those pretty magical moments...! (I'm just holding out my expectations to relive what I lived when I was 17-18 playing WoW Vanilla a little bit, but definitely more than happy to be proven wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
---
Gladly, you won't have any damage stats!
---
Generic random character.
---
Not going to be playing the game as it is sort of a waste given we are so close to Classic's launch.  I played enough during the last stress test.
---
I am instead going to be checking out/setting up addons/UI settings and making whatever adjustments I need.
---
which version is the alliance "evil"? Maybe wotlk because lich king was originally part of the alliance
---
Druid. You get your own zone, you get a spell that teleports you to said zone, and most of the recent game lore is connected to the druids in way or another.
---
The salt is real!  When you have zero counter points you just go full cry baby!
---
You keep living in your little dream world where no one likes me and Bobby doesn’t monitise the shit out of every IP Act/Blizz own.
---
 is rested exp, in an inn or capital, quicker if lot out ?
---
Is there a list somewhere of all the class-specific questlines? Kind of curious what I'm missing out on.
---
Are BGs cross realm right from the start? I have fond memories of fighting my recongnized and sometimes feared opponent community member from my server.
---
So, does anyone have any idea how to run anything classic locally? I really wanna configure my ui and addons somehow
---
Did anyone get back you on this? If not I can PM you
---
Stonetalon is horrible
---
Honestly, I disagree. The reason, at least for me, that the 50’s are bearable is that through grinding dungeons as a healer I can get real meaningful gear through hard work now. Unlike Retail where you replace gear you just got in like 10 quests, and that pre max level gear is worthless. Im looking forward to grinding those endgame dungeons starting around 54, getting a pre raid BiS, shit keeps you going.
---
I struggle with the 40ish - 54 grind, since I dislike the dungeons after SM Cath until the endgame ones.
---
Cataclysm
---
Curious from what edition of  The Hobbit that drawing  is ?
---
They’re doubling everything.
---
I *grew up* around Thrall, and have loved that character for literally longer than I can physically remember. I would so love to meet Chris Metzen one day, I legitimately cried when I read his retirement words
---
So?  Everyone in this sub probably bought gold at one point.
---
Who gives a shit, I just find it amazing that everyone has gone fucking insane because I dared mention reality
---
I feel like shaman probably belongs to the Troll, but then again, Tauren really is all 'bout that nature shit.
---
&gt;It’s a joke
---
I think it's an interesting question. Given a choice between human and non-human options in games, I generally choose the human one (e.g. Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, etc.) I think it's because it makes it easier to actually 'pretend' that you are the character if they look mostly like you, rather than being a cat/lizard/android/whatever.
---
That said, I'll be going Undead for Classic.
---
Especially at launch because the people who will get to those levels the fastest probably will have shit gear.
---
I like the alliance leveling zones and cities - I think they might be a little more fleshed out than the horde ones are. And I think it would be neat for you to get to see content you haven't really done before. I'd say go for it! (unless all your friends are on the horde...)
---
Upvited solely for this reference of Hunt, the reference non-beginner friendly game. Game is fun tho when you start to be not bad.
---
You misspelled Discord.
---
This is one of the very few things I wish was changed to a reasonable sum.
---
Either works, your best self-benefit from professions is the smoking heart of the mountain as you already said. Enchanting is usually levelled most easily together with tailoring. Overall you won't be rich because enchanting can be quite expensive to skill but with travel form you can get by without a mount for longer than other classes.
---
Other potential professions for your own benefit are engineering and blacksmithing (anti-fear trinket) but those aren't really required unless you are really pushing for raid tanking or pvp. Leatherworker will probably do fine for you.
---
This is nonsense. What people want is parity within their specialization. You want your holy pal to contribute as much as a holy priest, you don’t want your class reduced to a simple reskin. Otherwise, why have more than one healer at all?
---
This type of balance is not easy as the constant iterating on design  previous to class pruning makes clear. Class balance is a moving target once you start messing with the original design. You can either address the symptom by continuous retuning or you can, as blizz recently decided do a complete retool. 
---
Folks say that players asked for this. Did you? I certainly did not. I must have missed the poll. Folks also say repeatedly that blizz doesn’t listen to players. See the title of this thread. So which is it? Do they ignore everything except for the most important aspects of the player experience?
---
I think one needs to look at the bigger picture of what is happening within blizzard. There has been a massive push from activision to esportify and make games mobile friendly. These design imperatives can be easily seen in the way classes play out post prune. 
---
I’ve gotta run but I think this is not something to blame players for, unless those same players are also Warcraft developers. This is a massive corporation making choices that it believes will lead to the most profitable outcome. Since this strategy has not lead to an uptick in subs they are now “listening” to players according to Ion, to revert some of the changes.
---
Yeah reminding poeple of raid finder is surely advertisement for classic
---
Hi, completely new to World of Warcraft. I have pretty limited time, will I be able to enjoy classic if I only have at most 2 hours of gametime a day?
---
Could request your guild to raid every 2 weeks. Clear all the content one day before the reset and the day after, then wait 13 days and repeat. Won't miss a reset and onyxia/20 mans you can do as PvP specc
---
E,zx 3och  ,,rr
---
Well good and evil is a matter or perspective.
---
If you're a horde player you would consider the alliance evil for enslaving the orcs (WC 3 prologue).
---
If you're an alliance player you would consider the horde evil for being bloodthirsty invaders (BlackRock Orcs and the original warcraft).
---
Playing "well" isn't playing at a high skillcap. Playing "well" also means getting shit on by some sweaty private server kid like the op did which is why he thinks mages are overrated.
---
In Vanilla WoW, the Horde and the Alliance are both fairly new groupings and aren't specifically at war with each other. When you attack the other faction, you're supposedly acting independently of your faction's leadership. Both sides actually join forces at one point during the invasion of Kalimdor by the Old God, C'thun, with generals from Horde and Alliance making joint battle plans together. 
---
Although there are supposed to be some nasty characters on the Horde side, mostly in Undead territory where their Warlocks practice Demon summoning openly (as opposed to the Orc Warlocks who are basically underground). The Alliance-side Warlocks are always hiding out in basements and stuff.
---
But if there are any races that are supposed to be completely pure with almost no crimes in their past, that would probably be the Tauren and the Gnomes (but even they have the Grimtotem and Thermaplugg, respectively).
---
Yeap that is true! The feeling is amazing you log in and you see the old world it is exactly the feeling of going home. And the moment you enter the OG you are like a kid again the whole experience is breathtaking!
---
Yep, that gave me the final push to make this post. And I dont like it, but its better to know it now when we could pick something else, than mid game.
---
You can do old content like farming mounts.
---
No.  Buying a copy of a game is in no way the same as game monitisation.
---
Have you ever considered using a Combat spec for PVP instead? I used a Mace Combat spec with Riposte throughout much of Vanilla for both PVE and PVP and it worked really well for me. More importantly, I had a blast doing it. You can find out more about it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl3a9i/a_night_elf_mace_rogues_path_to_thunderfury/
---
I think he meant Westfall, not Winterspring. If you did mean Westfall, then I can understand your feelings towards those two zones, the only things that would bring me back to the alliance are the deadmines and the duskwood zone. 
---
If you did mean Winterspring then I have no idea what you're on about.
---
How is alliance good? What?
---
Even if you don’t pvp sappers are really good in raids
---
&gt; I just don't believe it originated on pservers
---
Then where the fuck did it come from? o.O
---
There should be games where you pick alliance or horde, and secretly Twilight Hammer.
---
Alliance bad guys? Maybe in your wet horde dreams. Putting war criminals in prison is bad? Mmkay.
---
and the pandarens but they dont come out until later expansions and I hear most people hate pandarens
---
Americas Army...something I haven't even thought about in a very long time. What an interesting game.
---
Would these be useful for hunters / shaman?
---
I’m only unsure as I’ve never played either!
---
The Alliance is less likely to pvp in any capacity.
---
Because it's more fun playing against the side on your server than a bunch of randos. Cross server is when I lost interest.
---
Anyone else is hopping into Vanilla as solo after playing many expansions solo? I'm looking for people to chill with and play casually (after the first few days hah..). Anyone else would be interested in joining up and going though the content? I will play horde this time for casual wpvp ( orc rogue)
---
The scourge had no free will. The forsaken do. It's like removing your guild member because a priest mind controlled them beforehand.
---
Thanks man
---
I've looked into this a bit myself and the issue with finding these damn videos is that so few people have decent raidframes setups so that we can distinguish between classes. A few of your videos are worth adding to the "evidence" pile but this needs a bit more looking into. There are biases.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cDpmFruhRQ - 6 locks, 2 hunters, warlocks topping meters throughout fight. (Although as another commenter pointed out, KT allows warlocks to make use of the 16 debuff slots, so this might not be a valid link.)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Vrb3d4G_k - (same setup as above, perhaps even same group) - 3 of the 5 top DPs are warlocks. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_keeIROmxwU - One warlock... 12th place in DPs... 
---
The fact that you say "Well, this Kel'Thuzad kill is kinda odd, because there is a lock and a hunter in the top..." shows a little bias- While you're correct in pointing out that these two classes aren't normally topping the meters at this point, it's worth pointing out that we weren't very good back then. And I don't really think the "average" player will be much better.
---
There will be guilds where hunters top the DPs lists once again. Perhaps not in min-maxing guilds, but ehh.
---
"Heigan, DPS meter speak for itself." - Good point here. There appear to be 2 locks (video quality is so bad, idk).
---
"Loatheb, where are the locks???" - Initially, I thought this was a bad example. However, after watching, I have to agree with you. There are at least three locks in that raid but I can't see them using shadowbolt. I tried looking for a shadowbolt through the video and I can't find one being cast. I can see that there are 3 curses on the boss. (curse of recklessness as well, wtf?) Corruption is allowed a slot usually because it is such a big part of a warlock's DPs, yet only one warlock has it up on the boss. I have to kinda conclude that the warlocks here are just bad warlocks. Although it is a good find. 
---
I'm not 100% sure why you're comparing hunters and warlocks though. Both are sought after in a raid environment and if you're playing either, you will get a raid spot.
---
For you
---
So, you basically have less than a handful of clips available where you can actually see what's going on, where we have no guage on player skill, gear or how much they're actually doing in the fight, and your argument from what I've gathered is that warlocks are worse than hunters and useless for DPS.  
---
Meanwhile there's also a COLOSSAL amount of people also saying, me included from my own past experiences, that they scale very well once you get Bloodvine and AQ-ish level gear and end up doing great DPS.  
---
What's the point of this thread again? I am genuinely uncertain because the only way to actively prove or disprove each of these claims is to sim them.
---
For horn color I like black, but the cream colored horns fit some of the skin colors better. The horns are everything, better get on the classic wowhead dressing room and try some combinations. Wouldnt want to be disappointed by the wrong horn choice.
---
...  I get the feeling you didn't heal much in vanilla.
---
Can't agree more with you.
---
It absolutely does not, its a shame that so many people are getting suckered into this hyperbolic bullshit.
---
BRD is long, we get that, we know that; but you are out of your fucking mind if you think its 5 hours.
---
In terms of BG's: 
---
WSG is just a rehash of the orc mission in WC3 where you kill ancients to harvest their wood. Horde is evil. 
---
Arathi basin is humans defending their land from the forsaken. Horde is evil.
---
Alterac valley is dwarves encroaching on frostwolf territory that they've owned since before the 3rd war. Alliance is evil.
---
For sure, most of the content is gated in phases anyways giving you lots of time to catch up on your own pace.
---
LOL:D
---
Isn't dm phase 2
---
Nothing in the original wow lore is good vs evil everyone has objectives nobody is evil for the sake of being evil except the old gods and rag because he’s an asshole
---
Core 2 Duo is from 2006. Pentium 4 or go home.
---
If you wind up on a low pop realm, which seems unlikely with how they are managing the rollout, it won’t be because you chose a PvE realm.
---
Look at the highest pop servers in retail and many are PvE and are popular now because they have been steadily busy realms since launch. There are plenty of dead realms but just as many are PvP as PvE. So neither is special long term for having a healthy population.
---
Something unique to this launch is also that most of the major streamers have at least mentioned that they may be forced to roll on PvE realms because otherwise simply playing the game would be impossible for them. If that happens then any PvE server with a notable streamer present is likely to be among the most busy maybe to the point of overcrowded.
---
Personally I am planning to roll on an RP-PvE server because I expect there to be only a few of them at launch and they don’t tend to be magnets for anyone except obviously the RP crowd, which on the whole in my experience tends to generate a less crowded but more stable population. They won’t be the busiest realms by far but I think six months or a year out they’ll be among the most stable with nice and established communities that will last.
---
I kinda hope they do monetize it more now, so people like you go back to their shitty private servers and stay as irrelevant as ever.
---
My friends have decided to play Alliance, I'm going to join them even though I prefer Horde.  We're planning to roll on a PvP server.  ? How tough is it playing a Warlock as Alliance when a good number of Horde are Undead?  I enjoy structured PvP on retail, but am I going to regret my decision to play Alliance after a month in contested zones?
---
Much more likely it was to try to quickly and easily sway some of the more fickle fans. He obviously doesn't really give a shit, just wanted to quickly boost his reputation and then people just easily forgive him.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
Scroll down to the section title Weapon Skill. The 8th point of weapon skill is worth 2% glance damage, every point thereafter is worth less than 1%. This is based on a formula from a blue post, posted by the developer who wrote it and confirmed by testing in the beta.
---
They are ruthless against every race, even their own. They are greedy, dishonest and reckless.
---
Orcs at least have honor.
---
Alliance and Horde are both evil, and both good.
---
Once they work out the respawn system, I'm sure they'll patch all that.
---
All I would like to say is that they enslaved the orcs for a long duration of time, and it might be dangerous saying that being xenophobic and enslaving people can be justified.
---
As a Hunter, Dragonstalker is way, way cooler than Giantstalker, imo Gianstalker is the worst looking of all T1 sets.
---
What?  
---
The only %hit you can get from talents are Affliction specific, so that can't have been the bug in question.
---
I think he means 20 days real time, which I disagree with. I’ll be playing 8 hours a day and will definitely hit 60 within 3 weeks as a solo warrior.
---
Few questions here:
---
1. If Ret Aura and Thorns and Fire Shield do magical damage why does the floating combat text show as white (and therefore physical damage)? And why does it not benefit from any spell damage increase benefits? For example if seal of the crusader (which increases damage done by holy effects and then have ret aura in it doesn’t increase it even by small percentage.. is that intended?)
---
2. I want to have mining and herb on the same toon - am I stupid or crazy? I know you can only have track one on at a time, have any of you ever tried leveling both at the same time in classic? Is it annoying to constantly flip back and forth the view or can you make a bind like to jump to have it switch back and forth so you do it without realizing? Any experience on this appreciated
---
Wait, voice chat will be in Classic?  I actually like this in theory.
---
Looks very fun. It's just too bad they're often OOM after each kill. I'd love to try a druid in TBC when they sorta fixed all the mana problems.
---
UK here. Also going to try and play on the 26th (11pm launch, here).
---
Wish me luck.
---
Not everyone has played Retail since Legion or MoP or whenever Mythics became a thing.
---
The pre-launch test to the right is though.
---
Well they starve their own people, forgot to pay the builders for restoring Stormwind (causing the Defias, which are actually good guys we go slaughter)
---
You forgot:
---
[Azeroth Auto Pilot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeroth-auto-pilot-classic)
---
[WoW-Pro-Guides](https://github.com/Ludovicus-Maior/WoW-Pro-Guides)
---
[Guidelime](https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime/)
---
It ruined world PvP and trivialized world design and the "strategy of adventure".
---
I suspect you were on the faction with better queue times, then. For more than half of players the queue times were just too big and pvp was dying (which is why they added it).
---
And at any rate, you learn the players from your servergeoup like you learn the players from your server. You just get to spend more time playing and less waiting.
---
How does that make any sense? Theres maybe 10k people playing on private servers from all over the world right now.
---
I think it’s the second one. That or they really don’t want classic to do better than retail.
---
Hey! I dont have a pc anymore, but i will need one before launch. I was thinking about a laptop, because i have some limited space.. But then i found this one. 
---
Asus Rog GR8 
---
i7-4510U 2.0ghz 2.6ghz 
---

---
Will it run classic? I think the idea of such small computer is nice, but wont probably run games like BF4.. Need some help on this!
---
Nah you set yourself up so they aren't on cd you should have everything on rotation so they can just stay stunned until they die
---
On psevers they didnt reset autoshot
---
It was, supression counted as hit for all spells, so you basically got 10% hit from that talent.
---
Shadow is probably better, she will be able to heal you just fine anyways, both when questing and in dungeons.
---
The crazy things we did for gold back then...
---
They finally listened after they told us "you think you want it, but you really don't" meanwhile nostalrius was blowing up and keeping tons of people from paying blizz. This is all just another work to get more money because the current game is failing so hard.
---
I like to think of retail as an online lobby action adventure game.
---
Never meet your heroes..unless theyre awesome humble geniuses like Chris
---
&gt;But then I have to keep up with poisons and lockpicking.
---
I leveled a rogue on a private server and this is much easier than I expected.
---
Not so bad as a dps you can keep clearing trash but if the tank or healer leaves.. gah!
---
Good luck, the earlier the better.
---
I don’t really have any fond memories of levelling or running around in weird gear unless maybe the first weeks of playing when I didnt know what was going on. 
---
The fondest memories and nostalgia comes from lvl 60 and the raiding and exploration of the endgame. And most of all the community we built inside our guild making all this possible.
---
Agreed.  WotLK was the last expansion that was any fun.  I stepped out after that.
---
Yes, that is in fact correct. I'm talking about if you want to fight another enemy right after
---
Who needs that when you have  [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
If you want to be dirty you’d go to hillsbrad farms, and the hillsbrad mines. If you want to be really dirty, you’d go to the elite dwarf fort in hillsbrad and kill all the horde trying to clear through for their quests.
---
In both cases you are hiding amongst allied npcs, so you can do this at-level and stop entire groups from progressing with ease.
---
I can ride a gronn on retail. I'm so completely cured of any desire to collect mounts.
---
What about dual talent trees that cost 50g to swap to and from each time? The lazy man's talent tree
---
Really disagree, the value in enchanting is not the leveling, even 265 isn't that bad. The value is in getting the rare patterns that people actually want.
---
there should be a dropdown thingy in the bfa thingy https://i.imgur.com/Vf6fTiW.png
---
I'm not sure sappers are usable in bear form, and swapping forms when raid tanking is unpleasant.
---
Leveling up as enhance from 11-37 focusing on entirely str/agi just for the sake of getting through the early levels fast.
---
And then at 38 with the new rank of lightning bolt and 4/5 lightning mastery respeccing elemental.  Its faster xp/h, no need to juggle 2 sets of gear and I personally find elemental waaay more fun/powerful.
---
My cousin who just has his first born was going to play with my group as enhance so we could coordinate elemental mastery chain lightning and storm strike wombo combos on targets, but that is now up in the air with the new babi.
---
But at that point, you're just living a lie :(
---
Yeah I’m EU too ^
---
I would be a fool if I think that one post will sway thousands of locks. And I would be even bigger fool to pick a lock if my goal is to see AQ40 or Naxx, after what I found.
---
It's only a reality in your own head. Just like how you think private servers will become more successful after classic launches (????????). You have got to be the most out of touch person I have ever seen and none of your predictions have come true.
---
With there was a preset for Vanilla system requirements
---
You gain rested much quicker in an inn or capital.
---
Welp, yeah that's definitely a fuck up on that servers part.
---
Look we don't like to talk about that okay? Gul'dan passed out the koolaid and we all thought it was cool until From started beheading people and we realized something was up with the punch.
---
Yeah I regret moving and faction transfering my original toon. Human mage to UD mage.  Played him exclusively vanilla to last phases of tbc.  Played a couple alts along the way but imo it's not a reroll unless the alt becomes a main. 
---
Reroll happened late tbc when an IRL buddy started playing wow and rolled lock. Figured rdruid would be a better teammate than mage to a lock.  That lasted until later in wrath when I started raiding on my rogue that I'd been slowly leveling literally for years. 
---
All that said, survival hunter in...hell, either cata or warlords I forget which now... might have been the most fun gameplay I experienced in all my years in wow.
---
Imagine reviewing a server. But not wanting to fully review it, and just buying gold instead, and then expecting everyone to respect his opinion/review. What a clueless kid (even though he's a fully grown man).
---
No because warlocks have utility to fight against all classes.  Take engineering to give yourself more options.  Structured is even more fun on alliance because you can get bop and freedom and don't have to deal with pallies dispelling your shit.  Also conflag build is better on alliance because you dont have shamans to fill the burst role.
---
Decent idea. One of the million approaches Blizzards *may* take in the future.

nobody cares about lfr man. ofc i'm not gonna be doing lfr.  I want good gear, in classic i will be able to get it by being semi-afk in retail that does not work. thats the point.

&gt; where did you test this? On PS server?

&gt;So, you basically have less than a handful of clips available where you can actually see what's going on, where we have no guage on player skill, gear or how much they're actually doing in the fight, and your argument from what I've gathered is that warlocks are worse than hunters and useless for DPS.
---
Most of them are from top guilds, and yes I assume they are competent and well geared players.
---
And honestly I would be glad if you could refute my clam, but please bring some authentic evidence instead of more PS videos.
---
It is the same in the inn/cap and gives a lot more thrn outside.
---
This +1
---
Something like this is just I'm hoping for
---
Nah man. People are bad. Rolled on a pserver in prep for classic launch. I figured that most pserver players would be pretty good due to the effort it takes to get started (download torrent, change realmlist, etc). 
---
People still do stupid dumb shit in instances. Fearing mobs, walking into more aggro, splitting dps, etc. Obviously there were other times when I got a super efficient group, but the bad ones are still out there.
---
With T2 off onyxia its very unlikely a hunter doesn't have dragonstalker helm before this drops.
---
It's the difference between riding your bike, or riding your Lance Armstrong bike in your little clown suit
---
Once you head down the rabbit hole as find who has been pushing the buttons and pulling the levers, you don't get mad at the orcs and undead anymore, you just wanna MAGA (make azeroth great again)
---
I played a Rogue in Vanilla and cleared BWL and made Rank11 with the same specc. I don't remember exactly what it was but I definitely used daggers. Its the same with Warriors. If you want to play PvP you have to play 31/20 and that specc is still very good in PvE, there is no need to go full retard and gimp yourself completely for PvP with going full Combat/Fury.
---
That was also after they greatly outgeared the content
---
And mage
---
No, it has nothing to do with that.   I am just right.
---
That's awesome
---
man just look at any vanilla video there were tons of people getting easy rides. why would this be a different time?

It seems to be the case that most vanilla private servers overtuned the raids to some extent in order to provide more of a challenge for players. Is there any information about how much harder raids, esp. AQ40 and Naxx were made compared to realistic estimates for the original vanilla? Feel free to PM if any links are associated with unnameable servers.
---
In particular most private server people seem to assume that crazy amounts of consumables will be necessary for Naxx, with for example this guy Ooze Spriest asserting that one should save up thousands and thousands of gold in order to be able to afford to raid Naxx on a limited time schedule.
---
Even though I get that Naxx was really hard in vanilla, I just can't wrap my head around all of that preparation and effort being necessary today, especially when a lot of Naxx raiders back then probably didn't go to those extremes and we will have so many advantages over them in terms of e.g. good connections and hardware, much more and better game knowledge and guides (including complete information about Naxx itself) available, most players having much better reaction speed, UIs, and being used to PvE fights with far more mechanics, and many other things.
---
i think you just read some stories about classic being harder than it was man. so sorry about your misconception
---
It's very minor IMO, and I'd take leveling quests for 99.9% of players over *slightly* more difficult rep grind. Honored is less than 1/4 of exalted.
---
But of course Blizz could also tweak it so leveling quests don't give rep on phases 1/2. I agree it would be more authentic this way.
---
There is an addon that is similar but none of it is automated.  You tell people what dungeon/ run you want and it puts you on a list for that one that others can see and invite your.
---
cooking is great for a hunter cos of this and yeah as nice as bats/owls are I use hyenas/boars instead and cook our kills to feed us both.
---

---
This one is really interesting. Combined with Questie and an ingame DB viewer it might be the way to go for me.
---
I'd love to know where the routes are from though.
---
We don’t know if bgs will be cross realm or not. I’d guess it’ll depend on how big the individual realms end up being
---
And of course, bgs won’t be in until phase 3/4
---
wow someone is salty, because they don't know how to properly heal in vanilla.
---
You’re discipline and self control is saintly

Okay so

Forum post. No data. Might as well not have posted it.

&gt;Link 3
---
Kungen's Screenshots from Naxx, some of which have Warlocks at the top of the meters. For a lot of the screenshots he struggles to remember the context, which is understandable considering it was *fifteen years ago* 
---
&gt;Link 4
---
You even admit that its "strange" to see a lock at the top, and the first video has no DPS meter, you're guessing at performance.
---
I mean, all of this is extremely questionable.
---
look up classic wow sandbox therell be instructions. otherwise i plan on subbing for the 8th so can configure everything and practice my leveling route.
---
&gt; Where did you test this? On PS server? 
---
That's from my own experience playing the game, I mained a warlock from Vanilla to WoD. Our guild progression was either 9 or 10 bosses into Naxx, before the guild exploded thanks to 4 Horseman and our tanks being retarded with massive egos. We had three warlocks in the guild, I was generally the best at gaming threat and spent some extra time grinding soul shards in order to bank Shadowburns off of Imp. Shadowbolt charges at any given moment. I realize that this wasn't common however, I did go above and beyond but since I had the option in the toolkit, it just seemed natural to do so.  
---
I was generally in the top 4 on almost all fights. Our two fury warriors tended to be on top and the ignite mage.  
---
Our second warlock was more of a raidlogger and didn't Shadowburn or such, he was generally around the mage pack on the meters, 5-6 to 10-ish and the third warlock was the GM's girlfriend who ran SM/Ruin and didn't do much.  
---
The only pictures I had back in the day was kill photos, so they wouldn't do much help. I also don't even have those anymore as that was like 7 harddrives ago.  
---
&gt;Most of them are from top guilds, and yes I assume they are competent and well geared players.  
---
&gt;And honestly I would be glad if you could refute my clam, but please bring some authentic evidence instead of more PS videos.  
---
Firstly, you can't assume anything about the skill level, dedication or anything from the players in any of those videos. The Loatheb video for example, there were 3 curses up yet I didn't see a single Shadowbolt thrown.  
---
Four Horseman video doesn't even have a damage meter anywhere and is from a resto druid PoV.  
---
As I pointed out earlier, none of those videos are indicative of anything at all because we have no guage on any of those players. We have no idea if they had any form of class understanding, any skill, any decent gear, we don't even know if they were hitcapped.  
---
You've basically made a thread that will actively scare away players from playing what they want, and all you've provided are unsubstantiated claims and videos that have a quadrillion variables behind them that are completely unknown.  
---
The only way to actually guage this shit is to sim it, or somehow give the best pserver players access to Blizzards inhouse reference client to test it. Beyond that, it's just pure speculation.
---
Ty for ur answer
---
Sure will, I play through to completion.  Plus I hate running across the world to find out I didnt collect the water sapta from Brine.
---
Deathcoil is a horrify, you can't WOTF that.
---
Warlocks are most weak to rogues - Most min/maxers for PvE will be gnome - but if you want to PVP as alliance, I'd consider rolling human for Perception, which will be great against rogues. They may have the WOTF, but they won't be able to cheap shot you :), and you won't have to use a felhunter to detect rogues/can stick with VW.
---
In structured PVP (BGs), you'll be ready and able to use perception when you're going into a PVP situation.
---
Thank you :)
---
Even then, we'll get it in classic eventually.
---
Last stress I played dwarf, next stress going to play nelf and launch going to play human. Gives me a chance to try all the starter zones for alliance which I never played before. Also going to set up all my addons
---
it lasts for 5min with a 30min cd xD
---
Desirable in just about every group pve and PvP. Playing solo will suck dick though.
---
I always considered Duskwood the best leveling zone
---
You can still loging into the Beta to see the LogingScreen.
---
Started on day one with a warlock. Got to Hillsbrad where I decided WoW wasn’t as fun as original DOTA in WC3, so I went back to that for a month or two. 
---
Over at my friends for a LAN party and I see his Tauren Warrior wrecking people in the exact area I quit, Hillsbrad. Thought it looked sick and thought I must’ve given up too soon. Started over as a Troll Priest, ya mon, named him Shakalaka and it just felt right from there. Took him through most of AQ before college pulled me away. Also leveled a Warrior and a rogue to 60, but the priest has always been my main since that first reroll.
---
Stalk them so they're half-way in and then kill them.  They'll have to get creative and coordinated with ressing or they just die to the respawns.  Ultra, never taken a shower, dirty there.
---
You’re gonna leave it in your bank by accident anyway
---
A myth can't just come out of nowhere, it has to have come from somewhere. Considering just how many people are sharing the same sentiment, I'd be hardpressed to say that it's completely unfounded aswell.  
---
It just doesn't add up in any way.
---
Lemme see you clear naxx in a year or so buddy.
---
lol what? you sub the 8th set up your ui and addons. still subbed for name reservations on the 13th and then you get a week and a half play time when it comes out. is $15 really that big of a deal im a college student  with not much and ill be subbing the 8th.
---
The reason we got “you think you do but you don’t” we because Blizzard used to listen to the community and then the community complains about it. Dungeon finder, LFR, Heroic raids, scaling raids, heirlooms, etc.
---
Most recently PvPers wanted stat templates and got them in Legion but then realized how much stat templates suck and complained about them until they got removed in bfa.
---
They made the mistake of listening to the community too much, the signal to noise ratio is too high.
---
I am also going casual feral tank, but I was considering Skining/herbalism till 60, keeping the herbs and selling the skin. Then dropping skinning for enchanting to get Smoking hearth and then dropping enchanting for alchemy. How do you thing, does it sound feasible?
---
Why is there no fullscreen option in my Classic WoW? Only 2 windowed mode?
---
I could ask for lunch money and just pocket that, I never use lunch money anyways.
---
I would not recommend Zygor
---
For me it’s about efficiency. I won’t be rushing but I don’t wanna be wasting time and I don’t think it will break immersion
---
I started out as a nelf Hunter.  Got to about level 30-40 on it.  Even though I enjoyed the class I didn't want to be a "huntard" as my friends who had been playing for a while called it.  So I rerolled a female warrior.
---
Got to about level 30 and realized I can't have a female character as my main, so I went back to my Hunter.
---
Windowed (Fullscreen) is fullscreen..
---
Thank you mate!
---
I see you are getting warmed up for classic, spelling rogue like they did back in the day.
---
Its rogue not rouge :D
---
prepared players with consumables will be preferred. 
---
and consumables is not all you need even a lot of money for repairs. and the thing that players from today are bether as oldschool pro gamer is nonsense.
---
another thing is skill if someone is a non brainer he will never see naxx.
---
good items all enchants some donations for the raid and high skilled is bether as a lazy non brainer who is not prepared.
---
Just make movie out of Christine Golden’s «Rise of the Lich King» novel.
---
This is gay as fuck
---
Due to humans going delusional and losing the ability to function from loss of sleep, it’d actually be much better to hibernate now sleeping as much as you possibly can preparing your body and mind for the long 40+ hour a day grinds that will come at the end of the month
---
Ok but now you’re pushing a line that the southern Americans pushed during the civil war in order to keep black people as slaves by justifying it, in saying “they didn’t kill them”. So you’re either wrong or you’re saying what a white supremacist says. Balls in your court.

As Alliance you can grind for the Winterspring Frost Saber and if you already love Winterspring its win-win.
---
Gonna test out asnd work out the setup on the stress test this week hopefully.
---
Yeah, I’m guessing a warrior would be best for this? Just auto attack with no weapon.....
---
No way this is feasible to level 60.
---
Is it wrong for me to think that Classic is going to be bigger than any expansion they've had since WotLK?
---
I'm just hoping when it happens I can get classic running out the gate on Linux. If not, it will give me a few points to work on before it actually drops either way.  Possibly just with a different name haha.
---
Best way to choose a class is chose based on what you will have the most fun with, forget all these people saying shamans pallys and shadow priests dont get raid spots. Just play what makes you most happy. if it happens to be shaman youve chosen correctly:)
---
Na. I’ve been accepted in to every stress test so maybe that’s why. I start it up and says no servers available to log in.
---
They should hand out alliance/horde t-shirts and water baloons at the entrence, would make for a hella fun water park.
---
The problem i have mostly seen are actually Tanks
---
They run in thinking they can aggro anything, get pissed off at everyone else, usually quit after the 2nd wipe if not the 1st.
---
I may need to roll a warrior just so this kinda shit does not happen.
---
BLIZZARD WORLD PLS
---
If you go pure holy, sure. But if you go a more hybrid build, which I suggest, like 30/21/0 then you will be able to with this example aoe farm quite nicely I suspect.
---
Eyes of the beast is the only reason you need to roll a hunter :")
---
Hots are great for fights like magmadar where the melee get feared and so does the melee healer. A rejuvenation can be the difference in life and death.
---
but is faster the hunter pulls and a hunter dont need fd after pulling
---
As someone who rolled an undead priest on a private server. DP was literally only good in WPVP sub 60. At 60 it was constantly dispelled, cleansed, and jungle remedied. Definitely rolling troll next time. Besides sub 60 when I used DP, most of the time it was on someone running away and all it did was save time because I would be able to kill the person either way since they are running. For actual fights I would rather have shadow guard 10 times out of 10
---
I would agree with this but with one caveat. It’s super easy to level LW if you’ve got the cash to buy leather. Leveling skinning would take you all over the world looking for ascending levels of mobs to skin. If you’re flush you can power level LW in orgrimmar In no time. Good for thought.
---
Yeah, something like that. If you're with clothies you probably want to be the one being hit (unless they have a pet) whereas being able to heal the warrior more allows them to go for longer since healing downtime is their biggest hurdle.
---
Invite expired
---
For real, just a circle-jerking rager.  Even just this last patch they added loads of cool new mounts, and the anniversary mount upcoming will be an in-game reward as well.
---
Ok on like the last day of beta I tested 3 (I think). AAP, AllyRoute, and Joanas, against a personal route. Done as a gnome rogue.
---
AAP was really nice, especially if you just want to turn your brain off and not do a whole lot of thinking. It stacked up really well. 21mins to 5, 10 in 2hrs.
---
AllyRoute was easily the worst, I would suggest not to use it. It felt like I was running around doing things in a very inefficient order, and the end time showed that. 25mins to 5, and then 2hr 30min to 10.
---
Joanas guide which is pretty similar to a personal route I ran was 21mins to 5, and 1hr 51mins to 10.
---
And lastly, a personal route I tested like day 3 of beta when there were still a ton of people leveling, I did 5 in 20mins, and 10 in 1hr 45min.
---
How is it faster than a tank pulling using their bow?? it just messes up initial threat a bit
---
1. It could be just a private server thing, but I believe that I saw Ret aura scaling with spellpower.
---
2. Sounds tedious af to do both gathering progressions but I'm sure there will be a sweet add-on that routinely pulses between the two or something.
---
He makes a good point regarding questie. It's more immersive to read quest text. But I often struggle with quests if I am left alone without questie. Is there a way to configure questie to not track quests by default, but only track that the quests you specifically point out? That way I could pick and choose quests to track, and they would be the ones I would get stuck on.
---
Personally I rerolled once. From human to gnome mage.
---
I don’t have recollection that people rerolled alot if they actually started playing at 60, but I do remember that a lot of the guys who were never able to raid or get a character to 60 kept rerolling a lot to find «the right char» or whatever.
---
You admitted to wasting a beta spot. Shame on you. I subbed for 6months just in the hope of getting a beta invite. /sadface 
---
But yes you will have uninstall beta or at least download and install classic client.

The website is missing BIS lists for Phase 1 (I only see pre-raid?)

The average average Joe who has moved on is someone who will subscribe to play at launch, realize they don't have time for this, and quit. If they advertise too soon though they risk their advertising being more of a waste because there is nothing they can currently sell. Ya, you could activate your sub for a 1 day stress test or character reservation but average joe isn't doing that. They want to get the most bang for their buck and are subbing on launch day, probably right before they try to log in for the first time.
---
The best time for them to advertise to the average joe is in the week leading up to launch.
---
This. Inconsiderate as fuck to waste four other people's time because you can't properly budget your own.

Locks are never on defense lmao. And Escape Artist is a very powerful racial. Getting out of roots and snares on a 1 minute CD is borderline broken.

Haha, I know you're joking, but what I meant was, I never got *INTO* the beta. I glitched my way into installing the client but never received a formal invite. I even wasted a 1 month token in hopes of getting in, so I share your pain!
---
Nice write up.  I don't really have an opinion on this, but nice write up.
---
One of my friends is going paladin so that could be fun. Thanks man!
---
Minimize chance of failure maximize chance of success
---
you must not have gotten all the way to 60 lol. Using DP on a warrior in STV at level 38 isn't going to be your life forever lol.
---
Yeh i see how a bunch of idiots in barrens chat can lead straight to auschwitz lol
---
We should just get a level 10-12 hunter raid and take all the night elves owls
---
He's not wrong though, warlocks get massive hype on these forums. Don't get my wrong, locks are good, but they're far from the god-class people make them out to be.
---
IDK how the math shakes out, but on bosses 40% of your white hits will do a bunch less damage. At best, tauren will do 70% while orcs do 85% with axes.
---
The real bitch is that orcs might be able to go with 6% extra chance to hit while taurens will need 9%, which means they can balance quite a bit of strength/crit/ap onto their gear in place of Hit.
---
All this said, a dps tauren warrior who's a better player, doing things like popping mighty rage potions in every death wish window will probably be doing better damage than an orc with axes who's slacking off. Cooldown stacking is where the damage is, so if you can line your death wish up with the execute phase with as little overlap as possible, you'll be doing more damage than an orc who can't do that. Overlapping Death Wish and Mighty Rage Potion windows will put you ahead.
---
That said, if an orc warrior does the same thing and manages his racial window on top of that, he will pull ahead from you.
---
And if you manage to get a pair of Edgelord's Gauntlets, you'll get a lot closer.
---
All this said, why would anyone *want* to be a fury cow? They're badass in arms or prot, fury cow is just repulsive.
---
It was basically rainbow six siege back in the day. Was a great game :)
---
So Broken Tooth is still going to be relevant in Classic Wow? That’s awesome, I was afraid the 1.12 game state would make it the same as any other cat.
---
This man knows Hunter
---
There's going to be a lot of people playing classic on launch day... Just because there's only 10k playing private servers on average right now, that is entirely different than a lunch day. 
---
It's all just a guess, but I assume there is going to be around 500k players or more trying to get in on launch day, and it seems fair to assume 40% (200k) will be from the NA and NEW region. My friend thinks it'll be one million +. 
---
Only 10k playing in two years from now? Entirely possible. I don't know the numbers... I'm curious what you guys think.
---
I was in Naxx before training past rank 1 frost nova. Just no point to it...
---
People who do very small things in order to maximize their efficiency. Like playing a gnome instead of a human for the 5% intellect racial, or playing a spec that is best for raiding instead of a hybrid one that can do multiple things.
---
Awesome, thanks for the info.  I like the human aesthetic better anyways so this is even more reason for me to pick it.
---
I’ll be publishing a guide within the next 2-3 weeks. 
---
Fenn’s Alliance Leveling Guide.
---
Much cleaner than Legacy.
---
You’re immensely wrong. Vanilla is by far when raids were the easiest, in any time of the game’s history. People just sucked compared to today. The «difficulty» was in organising outside of the raid itself.
---
 Usually used in the context of [**roleplaying**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=roleplaying) games, to min/max refers to the act of designing [**a character**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=a%20character) in such a way that one minimizes its weaknesses and maximizes its [**strengths**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=strengths).
---
Ya, he came through East. It was dope.
---
Min/Max means pushing your character to the limit. Choosing race, BIS gear, BIS stats, perfecting rotation, pulls, play style to be the absolute best you can be. 
---
In the classic community it gets a bit of hate because classic wow wasn’t about that. Classic wow was about the fantasy of the world, making friends, having a good time. It didn’t matter, as much, if you weren’t optimal spec or maybe weren’t running the optimal stats. If you were fun, funny, polite, people would want you around. You could, to an extent, play the game how you wanted and it was mostly OK. 
---
An example of Min/Max attitude is looking at M+ group who say “No (X class) should apply, as that class is not in the meta”.  The group only wants the absolute best meta composition and it doesn’t matter how good you are at your class. Vanilla wow did not have that, it was a more enjoyable game for it, that’s why many people, myself including, Hope this min/max attitude does not fully find itself back into classic.
---
Amazing.
---
&gt;40+ hour a day
---
Hmm...
---
To do something different
---
meh i actually feel the opposite i could never get into roleplaying as a human. but a sadistic undead or bloodthirsty orc or a peaceful tauren i can get into that very much. its more like roleplaying into what you visualize parts of your personality rather than roleplaying what you look like in rl.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if Blizzard returned this old layout for the Classic forums?
---
If thats how you want to have fun , enjoy ! You wont get there first but its doable.
---
?
---
I always found human to be an odd choice myself, but to each their own
---
Ty fam, ill be sure to google that. And yeah, the 8th is gonna be dope, but im not expecting to do anything else than dc lol
---
No rush to get there first for me.
---
That is a good point, but I'm happy being an 'enchant-bro/tailor-bro' for people :D
---
Is it correct that druids can't skin in form, but can pick herbs?
---
Shit.
---
Really that slow?
---
Human rogues are great in PvE with their +wep skill and +10% rep gain. The difference is bigger if PvP is your thing, but even then gear plays an even bigger role. I'm planning to go for same as you /shrug
---
For leveling? Going holy at 60...
---
That could be it. I know I'm going with one as my main since I've always played it and want to go back to it. If that wasn't the case, I don't see how spamming shadowbolt seems like a good play option.
---
Heh
---
TIL a Day is 48h

To be fair, Benthic is very useful as a catchup after you hit 120. Grab some tokens, get into good but not great 385 gear, you're pretty much set to start doing M0.
---
I do feel they should have made it unable to roll sockets though, given the out-performing Mythic raid pieces with 425 socketed Benthic.
---
yeah sorry bout that, wasn't aware of those weekly posts 
---
thanks
---
I always liked the all black with big horns as well
---
Gnome rogue.
---
Also give up your Epic Weapons.  
---
You can still buy grey ones from the vendors.
---
You’ll be drinking nonstop in dungeons and in general, big mana issues. Its gunna be reaallly slow leveling, you do like 0 damage and have to stop all the time
---
In terms of gameplay they made few very important improvements IMO.
---
M+ are awesome thing. I just wish they would go into difficulty curve rather than timer curve. I hate timer things, I like dungeons to take time with careful pulls and all those things. M+ is completely different experience favoring strange things like tank and healer prioritizing DPS instead of optimizing for their primary role. I don't like that. But the fact that dungeons are relevant for the entire expansion is really awesome.
---
Flexible raid size solves a lot of problems for casual guilds which always fight roster boss. No need for people to be benched, no need for cancelled raids because of some people not showing up.
---
Cross realm raids somewhat solves problem of dead realms.
---
Flexible raid cooldown allows to participate in PuG raids as frequent as one want to. I think that PuG raids are reliving its glory days.
---
Unfortunately they did not go to full length to introduce those things in mythic difficulty, but they really should do that.
---
Gnome rogue
---
"Done as a gnome rogue."
---
You're thinking of Informant
---
Why are there so many try hards here? Why not just play the game and enjoy it?
---
Is the Crit percentage I see in the abilities tab my chance to Crit per swing or per hit?
---
There's also Brian Kopp's Alliance (1-60) leveling guide:
---
http://www.oocities.org/iliektosuxit/
---
He wants you to not have vanish so he can kill you.
---
Assuming you had 100% hit chance -300 shadow resist, 100% crit chance, 50,000 stam and 50,000 int that's still only 800 dps. Warriors were regularly hitting 1000+ back then and hit 2k+ on pservers.
---
Compare this to rogue with diremaul buffs. They will do as much dps as a Naxx/AQ40 warlock in BWL/ZG/AQ20 gear due to threat cap.
---
I personally remember my dps dropping like a rock after the spell penetration nerfs. I did the same dps in BWL/ZG as the best geared locks were doing when Naxx came out. It was that bad. We still had the aggro problems no matter how shit our dps got.
---
Yeah a paladin + lock can beat pretty much any other 2 player comp.
---
Thanks for the info

Yeah I have no problem with it as catch-up gear. It's just it's over performance compared to much higher iLvl pieces like you mention. It's especially terrible when you consider how they specifically said not too long ago that this is the exact type of thing they never want to happen, then they do it anyways.
---
Assist will work.
---
Focus shouldn't work without an addon, as that was added in TBC.
---
I don't remember seeing someone test the reset to entrance on the Beta.
---
Download battle net client intaller and install it again. For some people built-in battle net update does not work properly.
---
I was so confused during the movie, was it the real gul'dan, or the alternate timeline one, wtf is going on? Having it air during the horrible WoD expansion timeline fucked with me and all my friends' heads.
---
It's not impossible, but unless you want to tank dungeons while you level there is really no upside to pick prot over ret.
---
What about protection makes you want to level with it?
---
I play alliance, but if Metzen said that to me I'd probably swap!
---
Yes the only way to play Classic
---
I won't use any add-ons while levelling my first horde and alliance characters 
---
To avoid missing out on quests and important loot I'm going to print out lists to keep track
---
In SOLO wPvP, which class is most dominant out in the open world in 1v1 and 1vX situations?
---
I agree but I'm just saying it didn't come from pservers, it came from actual vanilla. You are bringing up pservers for basically no reason.
---
go to china.
---
I don't think you can prepare your body for something by doing the exact opposite of it.
---
Because as Alliance you only have the option to play human; regular human, small human, tiny human and purple human.
---
The issue about 'the wrong story' wasn't about having not-totally-black-and-white characters or 'nontraditional plots lines'
---
When people say that, they mean that they picked the wrong part of Warcraft to tell as a story, especially as the very *first* movie in the universe.
---
The opening of the Dark Portal is a major event in Warcraft that is the result and convergence of like six different major plot lines with their own characters and stories.  It *could* be a great movie, but only after you're already familiar with the buildup from several angles, with characters you've come to know and care about through their own stories.  You've got Lothar and his friends who have become powerful in their own right through their own actions, you have the various kingdoms of Human kind, you've got Medivh's roll as the Guardian with the Kirin'tor and his both Spy and Apprentice Khadgar. And his Corruption whose source dates back to his Mother Aegwyn's story.  Which is tied back to Sargeres's Burning Legion and the Well of Eternity.  Which also ties into the hunt for the Draeni by Archimonde and Kil'Jaden, which led to the corrupting of the Orcs and the eventual Desolation of Draenor with Nehr'Zul and Guldan (which needs to be set up for the later Lich King chapter of this Saga).  Then things all come together with a Corrupted Medivh and Gul'Dan being used to open a portal so the Burning Legion can sick the starving Orcs upon the intractable humans.  
---
That's easily 3 to 5 movies of content that should all build up to this one momentous event.  
---
Instead, they try to tell that major story *and* introduce over a dozen major characters who are all involved in drastically different ways - plus the actual dark Portal opening and initial war with the humans - in a *single* movie.  There just isn't enough *room* to tell the audience what is needed to get them into a state where they can appreciate the story or characters, or care about what comes *after* the movie. This should have been something between movie 4 and 6, and instead they made it movie number 1.  It was just doomed from the start from that choice.
---
Yup and BWL and AQ and ZG and Onny. Everything up to Naxx was fairly simple stuff. Didn’t get to Naxx, so I can’t speak to that experience.
---
Druid tries to root you, but gets resisted from your shoulder enchant with nature resist.  😎
---
They have said that they won't be doing the same server sizes from original wow which has been known for a while now and the sharding is to help with lag and making sure 500+ people aren't fighting for a kobold vermin on day 1 and they have said that sharding won't be used in certain circumstances.
---
If all your worries are tinfoil hat issues then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised come Aug 26/27
---
He advocates for the kind of advertisement that takes money. A Facebook announcement is as low effort as it gets
---
So true. It’s a faster CPU that can turn your computer into an oven. So it’s a win/win.
---
Hakurai on YouTube has a pretty solid alliance leveling guide series, if you prefer videos over just text.
---
protection paladin exceeds in killing multiple mobs at the same time. but ret is slow aswell and even more gear dependant than prot. 
---
i'd recommend ret until level 35 when you can get reckoning ([0/25/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGzIc0x)) the next points will go into the holy tree for 10% strength, seal of righteousness damage and consecration then just go down prot and put the remaining points where ever you want. 
---
prot paladin isnt actually as bad as people say it is. if you want to tank at level 60 you have a much different spec because reckoning becomes useless: [11/31/9](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVhxIxzVoV0L)
---
Same shit had happened to me, I also thought who the fck is gonna play this old game and but still have it a try. I was hooked Instantly, I didn't reach 60 though as I was busy in Vietnam ganking noobs there. It was fun as hell, this time I am prepared, my main goal is get rank 11. I just can't wait to play a videogame.
---
No.
---
But there fill likely be addons which provide the functionality.
---
I had to update my b.net client, it apparently doesn't update on restart or even prompt you to do so (in my case anyway). I just figured I had to install the 60GB retail tumor on my drive before any classic option would pop up, thankfully they seem to be completely separate clients.
---
He said in Thrall’s voice, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any alliance infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
As I left the the store, he turned around and sucker punched me in the face.  Again in Thrall’s voice he whispered “Throm Ka, Warrior.  No one will ever believe you.”
---
Better to download a couple of books instead.

---
It's the top pinned post on the subreddit
---
&gt;If Mr T came out and just said "Yeah, this is Classic... It's coming back, get on that shit" it'd kick off and we all know it.
---
That would be dope. He can't be that expensive.
---
Done it. Yes...it is that slow.  
---
Remember young Thrall's mount during the escape from Durnholde?  
---
Maybe even slower than that.
---
I love the story of Duskwood, but man it sucks running back and forth between Darkshire and the Graveyard area a bunch of times.
---
Literally none cares about sulfuras so I'll take a better questing experience any day.
---
Not saying they shouldn't reintroduce visual bugs, but I hope they prioritize bugs the impact gameplay over issues like this.
---
It’s not that bad, it will be slower than ret once ret can get SoC. SoR does good with a one handed. The good about it that I tested is you are obviously tanky as fuck. Accidentally pulling a couple mobs isn’t a big deal. If you don’t spam your judgment cooldown and concentration you can find a good rhythm/mana conservation style that has a little down time. Really it only gets better after level 20, eventually you’ll be getting a lot of reflect talents and your aoe mob pulling will be really good. Dungeons are a lot easier on a paladin tank than people think. If you watch your mana and people don’t pull extra shit, you’ll find a good rhythm that doesn’t require a lot of drinks. In dungeons just remember that judgment should only be used as a taunt or threat generation, save your mana any way possible. Slower but I really enjoyed messing around with prot.
---
Mostly neglible, yeah. That last ws will account for like 3% tops of mitigation on white hits tops. There's still the racial, which can be quite powerful if stacked correctly. Not as good as troll though.
---
And good point about the axes.
---
That said, it's semi-unlikely that you'll be able to get your hands on edgemasters though. Demand will be high and they don't drop often.
---
Already subscribed for the heck of it. Will buy subscription on my girlfriends account so we both can fool around an hour or two. Maybe check how the sharding/layering works.
---
Not to mention gear was hard to get.  Maxing wasn't a simple matter of "I guess I'll just run UBRS to get my Pally chest...".  You can run it dozens of times and not drop the chest, so there's a whole lot of just making due with what you have.  Drops could be so frustrating, that you'd probably be clearing Molten Core or ZG before you can even get pre-BiS, so you just end up with a mix of sets and random items anyways.
---
Remember when everyone said “please remove tier sets” and they did ?!
---
Why? Disney paid a zillion dollars for Star Wars and are turning it into a money pit. I'd think investors would want them to figure out that mess before buying another expensive franchise.
---
You need to download it first in the Battle.net launcher.
---
It served me fine for about 5 years until I upgraded to a quadcore q6600, and then to a 3570k that I'm still using. If the numbers stay like they are, my next upgrade will be going back AMD :)
---
I had the beta too. Had to install the "normal" classic version anyways.
---
I was planning to do the exact same thing with my profession's on my tank Druid for a while. But after some research I figured that leveling with enchanting would make me very poor. I believe that getting it to 265 can be done more efficiently after hitting level 60. 
---
My current plan is to level with mining and skinning, drop screening at 60, level enchanting to 265, make my SHotM, drop enchanting, and level up engineering. (Substituting mining and engineering for Herbalism and alchemy is a personal preference. I might end up doing that myself tbh.)
---
He shouldn't test these things on an early client, he should test them in a retail client. The TBC macro API isn't correct, but Classic uses the same API as retail sans a few commands. These macros should trigger in one press. Since Warriors no longer have stances, test them with Druid transformations.
---
If you bind the modifier keys to the stances instead of the macros, then you lose the ability to use modifiers for any other macros. There are only 7 or 8 buttons in my layout that need to stance dance. The rest of my macros, including chat callouts, target marking, item uses, gear swaps, would be incredibly cumbersome without modifiers.
---
It was just one funny thing that Kevin's Jordan said during the interview, feel free to listen to it. You don't need to focus on the joke and take it so literally.
---
I tried to do the exact same thing a while back because I was going months at a time without internet and so was playing a lot of a personal pserver. Sadly I never discovered a way, any method of downloading it didn't include a functional search bar or database buttons, so you had to manually type URLs or click direct links in comments, making it useless
---
I THINK I know about 95% of the Quests in my head on the Horde side. Otherwise Thottbot.
---
Will fix Questie for my girlfriend.
---
Imagine the nerve of people wanting to roleplay in a roleplaying game
---
Honestly not that bad, though much better once you get reckoning and holy shield as they provide some nice continuous damage. The problem is you end up getting these late if you want to tank dungeons since you have to go for Conc to tank groups. If you just solo level, rush deep prot because Conc is very mana inefficient. 
---
Caster mobs suck to fight because most of your damage dealing / threat goes out the window.
---
Did it on a private server to 60. A highlight was rogues trying to gank me in the world dying to hitting me, only to realize too late and eat a hammer of wrath while sprinting away. Also saved up some money into early 50's and bought Skullflame Shield, very fun item as prot.
---
If I were to do it over I would invest more into Shield spikes while leveling, you block so much that it would get a lot of value and speed up the process.
---
Human or night elf rogue? Obviously the wep specialization is really good, but how much does it actually affect dps? Does the nelfs superior base agility help compensate for the gap? And how much does the improved stealth night elves have actually matter? I just want to know how impactful these racials are and if I’d be at a loss not going human. I prefer the night elves animations / mounts way more.
---
Different strokes for different folks. I personally have fun trying to be the most efficient I can. While my buddy likes to drink into a stupor and mindlessly play. We both have fun just don’t like  playing together.
---
Its cross-world from the start. Phase 2 will add the honor system without bgs so you’ll have world pvp with just your server. Bgs will be cross from the start in phase 3. This is likely to prevent dead queues on lower pop servers
---
That can also be applied to the warlock however, as any good warlock will add Shadowburn sniping Imp. Shadowbolt stacks and properly gaming threat.
---
The whole scenario just doesn't add up as some people are saying that warlocks are doing less DPS than feral druids, others are saying that they're competing with rogues/mages.
---
If we go by just purely mathematics and the spell damage values for individual spells, a Naxx mage should do something like 2.1k fire balls and crits for 3 - 3.3k.
---
Warlock is around 1800 shadowbolts and 3.5k-ish crits thanks to Ruin. It shouldn't even be mathematically possible for warlocks to somehow do less than half the damage of mages, so the entire argument is just all sorts of fucked.
---
Alliance is disgusting
---
Maybe it was just panser and her gang who asked for face rolling. I don't remember anyone asking for dungeons to be made smaller and easy. LFD, LFR to advertise one is looking for members is nice, but I don't agree to auto teleport to dungeons. It will be nice if we can access this UI by reaching the dungeon entrance and using the meeting stone.
---
There is (or was, over a decade ago) a theme park near Beijing with a giant statue of a Warcraft ghoul. The rest of the park wasn’t Blizzard themed, but seeing that definitely made me want a WoW themed park
---
I get it’s a joke but It makes me cringe that fact it’s taking the piss out of systematic black oppression.
---
Well, from my personal experience what buttons you pressed in raids was not on top of anyones concern in Vanilla. Social, coordination, preparation and team coherency was. I think the obsession over rotations and «is my class boring?» etc comes from WoW post-vanilla. 
---
Unfortunately players who come from retail are going to be very much caught up in stuff like mechanics, rotations and the balance of your class - also likely have a much lower attention span. I think it’ll make for a less enjoyable experience for those players.
---
This wasn't a thing in Vanilla. 
---
There were several cast bars which showed your Ping, and people would use /stopcasting macros to clip their spells.
---
From what I have seen in the Beta there is spell queuing.
---
Is hardiness overrated or is it really THAT good?  I can't decide between troll or orc hunter.
---
Duskwood is cool. If you havent experienced it yet, you should.
---
75g?? Do we not get decay like you did in vanilla?
---
Fun fact, you're also among allied NPCs if you go to durotar, at Tiraguard Keep. So you can go their and heal the humans as hordies try to kill them.
---
If there is an option for people to cheat/make things easy they will do it. (Not all of us though, some people are genuinely looking for a challenge).  
---
For all you people planning to "ease the pain" with add-ons I hope they all cause many ui errors for you and lead you to useless quests where everyone else with such addons are congregating like the noobs they are.  
---
Play without add-ons to 60 for at least your first character if you want a genuine developper intended experience that I would truly call "Vanilla".  
---
I've never been a fan of sprinkles which is pretty much what addons are.
---
Heck, I don't remember what happened yesterday, nvm 14 years ago.   I was a shaman, so I was in the thick of it.
---
My experience basically being forced to be in PvP servers if I wanted to play vanilla via pservers had left me super bitter about it all. The toxicity can be wild, and the vast majority of the time that world PvP occurs its either you literally just bullying someone by killing them in an unfair fight, or someone and their friends doing the same to you.
---
I don't like me no zero sum games and PvP is mostly that.
---
I don't think you could do it in the vanilla client without addons. I'm pretty sure you could by the end of Wrath. But yeah, Classic uses the modern API so everything in Legion/BFA is in.
---
Lol I mean I get why they did it, but I’m trying to avoid a ton of dungeon wipes from me dying all the time.  Then having to replace the people who leave and whatnot.
---
My interface. Getting all my addon ducks in a row and tinkering with that until I am satisfied and ready to jump into Classic on release.
---
Before that, I'll check out how stressed the starting zones are and whether I can break away from the zerg, though.
---
Haha fair enough. All I have to say is give W3 its chance, it is a masterful piece of entertainment (and the story, gosh, you'll end up liking wow even more).
---
Im EU, don't have BfA installed, haven't had a sub for well over a year, didn't get the beta or any of the stress tests and I could still install it like a week ago.
---
Everyone is trying to save everyone from themselves, no one is allowed to figure out how they want to play the game by themselves.
---
I’m Alliance. I play rogue though. My guild on my pserver does it in a way that basically hangs the melee out to dry. I’ve tried convincing them theres a better way but the server was very low pop from the start so we don’t have the best possible players in our raid team.
---
Let's hope Threat Plates will be updated for Classic. This way you'd have that feature.
---
it's part of the [enemyFrames](https://github.com/zetone/enemyFrames) addon. For classic you can use [Classic Aura Durations](https://willitclassic.com/view/SFMbZS2ioc4AtS1dEDm9) It does the same thing.
---
Yeah that is probably the bigger part. Though this hasn't been much of a problem in WoW lately except in the Dungeon Browser.
---
https://items.classicmaps.xyz
---
This might be useful in future - just search (ctrl+f) for the item number of the item you're interested in. Item numbers are usually listed on any item database site.
---
You must know farming spots I don't if you're pulling 30-50g/h solo.
---
It's not better than having to look at a character you can't stand for multiple 100 hours.
---
That said, yeah. If you like pvp and you're horde, orc is probably for you.
---
I’m not and it’s not a matter of opinion.
---
Make human, go to darnassus, start leveling rep and xp.
---
Thanks for listening!
---
&gt;Do you guys feel this would matter, or would its inclusion be close enough to the original experience?
---
No it does not matter at all and one of the reasons is normalization. That bad boy had the highest top end in the game and then that same patch I believe got it to calculate your mortal strike at 3.3 speed instead of 3.5
---
There is no such thing as the original experience in Classic WoW unless you get a time machine.
---
I have a Pentium 4 on my keychain. I wonder if it'll still work with a speed hole in it.
---
Is that annoying thing even in classic beta, can someone confirm? Some of the dumbest shit ever. This annoyed me so much.
---
This and the fact that they reduced the distance in which nameplates show up just to make it "blizzlike". Christ..
---
Yes, because not being to ask a quest giver for more accurate directions than 'to the East' seems silly.
---
Hopefully there will be a server that bans dad gamers
---
The droplets are nice. Do you think it will cost more than the basic 5$/month?
---
Should be instant. If not then it won't work.
---
What are "control buffs"? Do you mean loss of control debuffs like fear?
---
The thing is i could buy a high end pc if i want, and build it myself. But i dont have the space for it :/ The idea of hooking up a smaller pc to the TV and play casual games sounds perfect for me. I will however look for smaller chassis in a regular pc, and get more powert for the money. I know i would end up want to play BF4 and probably other games aswell. Havent played anything for 4 years.. but thank you for the tip!
---
Bats have a shitty diet that's why you go owl
---
Thanks, now I don’t feel like such an outlier.
---
This is default for Classic. No addons required.
---
Holding aggro isn’t an issue going 2 hand arms in dungeons?
---
\&gt;Does the nelfs superior base agility help compensate for the gap?
---
no it does not. You go night elf for looks if you're into that. You'd be at a bit of a loss but it's not that big of a deal, especially since you already get skill+ from base rogue, and those 5 first points are the most important.
---
It only ever matters on raid bosses, too.
---
But they have different diets, bats eat uncommon foods such as funghi and cheese
---
Dungeons non stop to 60 definitely going to take a long ass time. Just deal with the people and group is what I say. It’s dungeon finder where you get xp for completing it with heirloom increases.
---
Anyone just absolutely love a particular class? I have changed my mind a few times now but it seems that I have genuinely narrowed it down to Shaman or Warlock... which means I will probably play neither
---
Hahahahaha the fact you even put that K server in the same sentence as nostalrius is a joke. It was known for years for being the absolute worst coded vanilla server on the market.
---
Sorry man, I love your videos, but you've lost a subscriber here too. Great videos, but try to act a bit better when you're not recording too. Classic will probably get microtransactions, sure, server transfers and character re-customization. Whoop de gosh dang doo. They already said that they wanted to include a Classic Collector's Edition, but decided not to because they didn't want to include a NEW companion, and they didn't want to diminish the coolness of the OG collector's pets.
---
Blizzard likes money, sure, every company does. But they're **not stupid**, as much as we all think they are. The right choice FINANCIALLY is to not include cash shop mounts, pets, and boosts. They KNOW who the target audience is for Classic, and they KNOW its generally the type of person that will not buy mounts and pets and would rather go back to private servers instead if they include them. They'll do as much as they CAN do, but they cannot do much. Classic isn't the next big thing for Blizzard, its just a thing they can get away with making.
---
2/10 troll attempt
---
That's so fucking cool man. What a great dude for doing that in Thralls freaking voice too!
---
I'll be playing spelladin. Why would I respect holy?
---
Once again getting to honored is a pretty minuscule rep achievement and there’s still a pretty significant effort involved otherwise to get hand of rag. 
---
You’re very much overthinking this.
---
If we're playing this game, you were horrible at basic logic. Rated battlegrounds is a much better display of both intelligence, skill, and teamwork. Arenas is just playing the FotM teamcomp.
---
Its even less of an issue because youre doing more damage. Use your shouts and spam sunder
---
I have 2 laptops at home, but they are maybe 5-6 years old. I cant play legion on either of them, newly formated and lowest graphic settings :/ to much lag. 
---
Your probably right, if i find a decent pc with a small chassi, thats alot better! I will look for more used stuff, i still have some time :) thanks!
---
2nd account. This will have 0 impact on my main's 1-60.
---
It probably has to be translated to a bunch of languages too, and go through some standard approval process.
---
Did you happen to read the title of the thread? "LEVELING".
---
Also everyone knows about broken tooth.
---
He is rare and highly camped.
---
Owls have some threat.
---
And finally, again, this is about leveling
---
That's so awesome. I'm glad he's as down to earth as he seems to be
---
Slows, roots, fears, stuns etc
---
Holy shit really? Thank fuck.
---
If you’re into the lore then pallys in Duskwood is really cool.
---
Your absolutely spot on. The gaming market has been taken over by "whales" who care not for their client and the integrity of the game, but only exploiting people out of money. And there in lies the problem with most of the industry these days. The game developers are passionate about what they do and all strive to make great games, the problem is the CEO's of said companies only care about huge short term profit margins.
---
Wife and I are duo leveling priest/warrior. I plan on going arms and she hates shadow and will be going disc.
---
Bro I appreciate the older generation lookin fir older times. I keep seeing all these retail players talking about how we need to have their mind set. But I’m not playing classic with a bfa mindset. I’m playing with a vanilla mindset and I can’t wait.
---
I guarantee I have been higher in both RBGs and Arenas than you, and I can say with certainty than the demands of Arena for skill level are so much comically higher.
---
Rather than create a new thread, is there a great spot for Alliance to set their hearthstone during leveling? I was horde when I played vanilla so I don’t have a good grasp of where to call home as alliance.
---
I prefer desktop.  The AMD 2600x is really cheap right now and it's a solid CPU.  Build your own and save money.
---
Was a human mage until lvl 30 or so, rerolled rogue after being ganked in Stranglethorn by lvl 60 players..
---
Been a rogue main ever since..
---
Try /r/buildapcforme
---
No, last time I used it it was a broken pile of shit that crashed all the time (I didn't even know addons could do that).
---
They are coming, with server forums
---
...Goddamn it...And here I thought I'd might be able to get my good ol' community battleground fix and rank up before the game starting going down its path of diluted communities and irrelevance.
---
Leveling prot is not slow at all especially as a paladin. I would argue that I can clear more "even level" mobs over time than a ret. Your dps really isn't that bad and there's hardly any downtime
---
Select a price point, go to any pc website like newegg or cyberpower, choose whether you want laptop or desktop (desktop will always run better for the price you pay), and then just get one.  Honestly with classic wow you don’t need to worry about specs if you are trying to buy anything at or above $300 dollars.
---
Thanks! That actually (sort of) worked. Twitch saw it and finally gave me a different view when I switched to my "_classic_" folder. However...
---
...After downloading the latest version of "Details! Damage Meter" for Classic, Twitch also showed an "Update" button. And on pressing that, Twitch stupidly updated it to the Retail version. Dangit! :)
---
So, I think we're almost there. Thanks again for your insight!
---
Respec cost is a gold sink. If you want to respec pay for it. Vanilla isn’t about convenience. It’s small things like that that got us bfa.
---
Good question. for someone with say 52% armor reduction I'd imagine it's 
---
damage taken =base damage\*0.48\*0.9
---
, but I don't actually know
---
/r/buildapc is a better place for this, but you can find some great deals on older gen ryzen processors that will handle the game just fine even at max settings. Pair that with 16gb of decent speed ram, an SSD and a gtx 1660 and you’re golden for under $800
---
This was a long way of saying, play the game how you like.
---
There was pretty large itemization changes on gear in tbc for starters. So they’d have to change a lot in order for hellfire peninsula greens to not grossly outclass T2. 
---
Also those tbc encounters were built with tbc class design in mind. So how does blizzard reconcile that a bunch of classes are doing content without their redesign or a huge chunk of their new abilities. Do horde still not get paladins? Does alliance still not get shaman? Do we need to introduce the 2 new races? Do we skip the new races and make Tauren paladins and dwarf shaman? It just creates a huge ass rabbit hole that people don’t want. 
---
I’d be all for a TBC server or two though if we get enough interest in classic.
---
&gt; the god-class people make them out to be.
---
Honestly, people mostly think of Soul Link 1v1 fights when they talk about warlocks. Any other context and warlocks are fine but not insane, generally a notch below mages in PvE and PvP.
---
Idk i would much rather be able to get queues without waiting an hour. Youre still gunna get a lot of people from your server anyway
---
You don’t have to pick one. If you want to have a different one pay for it like everyone else. It’s not like there’s no way to respec.
---
Just do like me and play all classes, lol
---
Leave Britney alone!
---
&gt;You are the main character telling your story through quests and exploration.
---
Thats retail. I wouldnt say im the main character in classic.
---
Exploration is never a good strat, level 10, no gear no money no skills. Does not matter if you where fast, you are now behind everyone else anyway.
---
Hunter. So versatile, so good at farming, just so fun.
---
I’m saying it would be all bad.
---
You dont need prot spec to tank dungeons before end game. Just have a decent shield and 1h in your bags that you can use. Some low lvl dungeons can even be tanked with 2h.
---
Hopefully they have updated the API so everything works as it should
---
Hunters will have an advantage with their quick tags.
---
They've been the target audience for the video gaming industry ever since the inception of the smartphone.

Finding good people and building a community. Best part of classic WoW and something new games totally lack.
---
I can remember it being maybe 30 mins or so on my server/faction combo, but that didn't feel bad at all because people would just do World PvP or duel in the meantime, was a blast.
---
Of course that didn't become the case when capital city battleground access was added, then it became more of a case of sitting around doing nothing.

BTW, if you do use Twitch's curseforge.com website to search for Classic Addons, you have to find the Classic-specific download button on each project page to get the right file. Otherwise you'll get the Retail version.

No. Although I think it reduces the failure chance on black lotus.
---
That's how the developers described their intentions with the writing, but it's entirely possible to read it differently. You don't have to take authorial intent as gospel, and if what they actually created is different than how they describe it then it's possible to come to a different conclusion.
---
The horde are generally put in a "tough place" through circumstance, but not everything they do is a direct reaction to this.
---
Joana's will probably be the best guide on Alliance, the others don't have anywhere near the same amount of effort put into them.
---
One of the drunk people will wipe a lot of people on cthun.
---
I know your mind control plans
---
Capital city access is in from the start. And my server in vanilla had about 2 hour queues after horde started stomping and the faction balance got bad. Most pservers even with like 10k have long ass queues because one faction just starts queueing less. Imo its worth the community sacrifice to make sure some servers actually can pvp
---
No I remember a big portion of the quests on both sides and plus these are the thing I don't like that were added into retail.. its very not MMORPG and kills any sort of freedom with your choices because your basically following a GPS tracker from quest to quest.. Fun stuff.
---
If someone truely wants to min/max then they should be doing the research themselves.  With that said, I have never once read someone asking what’s best for min/max and then get shunned for trying to do so.  You mind linking just one example of this happening?
---
When the Alliance would hit Tarren Mill, I'd turn on Eyes of the Beast and chain gank all their lowbies in the back lines.
---
Once they got so upset that they sent a squad of suicide Gnome mages to take me, and just me, out.  It was glorious! :-)
---
You can totally stay with Enchanting after making your trinket. But honestly its the same situation with Alcy/herb, 99% of cloth users will already have enchant/tailoring as its a good combo.
---
Pick what you like. LW/skinning is a great combo and since most ppl go Tribal LW you picking Elemental LW would offer another option and maybe you get lucky and get the recipe for Shifting Cloak which is pretty decent for your tanking :)
---
I don't think it's going to be too terrible except in human/orc starting zones 1-6.  Just kill everything that you can tag to and from quest locations
---
I had to finish the water Temple for so many of my friends and so many of my brothers friends im pretty much an expert at the place.

Paladin can heal extremely well while being super efficient on mana in vanilla.  Paladin healers will outlast a priest for mana anyday.

For wow classic to be able to play in 3 weeks, We should download normal bfa game and then there is option for classic? Or we should download just classic somehow?

Pro tip: just because it’s a blanket response doesn’t mean its not also someone’s opinion. I think you’re having trouble with the fact that most of the people in this sub all share the same opinion. Just because we all say the same thing doesn’t make it not an opinion and not valid. A blanket response is still an opinion.
---
not shadow.
---
devouring plague rules for shadow. and undead racial is far superior in pvp.
---
the only thing the troll racial is good for as shadow is making you go OOM and it doesnt even apply to your dots in classic.
---
Both playstyles aren't that different, you're gonna be autoattacking mobs from 1-60 either way, and retribution has the best talents for that thing specifically
---
Questie, the classic version.
---
Questie
---
The 30s are the new 20s anyway.
---
I'd kill the 6. If you're melee, you have a much better chance to hit lower level enemies. If you're a caster, pushback doesn't care about the level of the opponent
---
The storyline between horde vs alliance in vanilla wasn’t really good vs evil. If you quested both for the most part you got the impression that they’re both just at odds for seeing things from different sides with different motivations. 
---
Sylvanas was sitting in a room the entire time and Nathanos was fucking around at some shack in the plaguelands so even the darkest storylines which where on the side of the forsaken were mostly just a group of dudes trying desperately to survive, and recouperating from what had happened to them to create them to begin with. 
---
Some factions you didn’t even real hear about a war in their quest lines until you got to contested zones with all factions and even then it was mostly just an afterthought like “hey misterslippyfist I need you to bring me back 10 rabbit pelts so I can make a coat. I’d go myself but the horde and alliance are at war”
---
The end game stuff was mostly just random as hell and good vs evil. Both nefarion and ragnaros were introduced in very “who the fuck? Oh he has pretty purples?! Gotcha we in that bitch” Onyxia had a pretty awesome story atleast on alliance side. Aq and naxx where the first time they introduced raids as part of a large more grand story.
---
Questie: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/questie/
---
By default it shows on the map where to go to get the quest objectives too, but you can disable that in settings so it just shows quest locations (and any turn in locations) on map and mini map.
---
Rerolled from tauren warrior to troll warrior because both my older brothers were trolls. Played that char from 1.11 to end of TBC when i rolled belfadin wich i still play! ^^
---
Absolutely, but they claimed their slurred speech was no hindrance on their ability spam frost-bolt for 6 hours.
---
Huh, I didn’t know questie showed available quests on the minimap? Is there a toggle to turn off the arrow/map waypoints for quests you’re on?
---
\#4 is really a good point. Having an off tank pick up some of the extra utility skills can be very helpful. Imp Demo Shout and/or Piercing Howl can be super helpful
---
This. I play Tauren because I love the Native American theme, the tribal aesthetic and the Taurens peaceful nature. 
---
I relate more to the whole “gentle giant” aspect more than playing a human that vaguely resembles me

Pretty standard, the same as you would level with solo. Imp hamstring can be replaced with 5/5 2h specialization for a little more dmg, but imp hamstring is extremely useful in PvP situations that will happen a lot during the leveling process, especially in STV.

You can build a very capable amd machine for &gt;$400.

Yeah, what a novel concept. Bucking efficiency and instead just trying to enjoy the world after a 14 year wait and loving the adventure and community again!
---
Word. Thanks! I thought it possible that this feature was included in one of the big questhelper addons.
---
Thx a lot i found it)
---
Nope
---
I'm right there with you man, I miss the idea of building some heavy rivalries and the queue times were long at times but not as bad as some others have stated.
---
However this far down the line I think it's too far for them to change it, the silver lining is there is far less servers (I think) this time around, so you might be able to get the same rivalry with familiar faces.
---
It was not there in classic so everything Blizz has ever said indicates "no."
---
If you say so, dear.
---
And then people say Warlocks won't be wanted in groups, lol.
---
I give it exactly 1 month before people won't even zone into Razorfen without a Lock in the group to get easy replacements.
---
Yeah I imagine the gold sellers will be pretty rampant if they allow starter editions to go into retail which I really hope they don't because otherwise the gold sellers will actually have to buy a wow sub to farm so when they get banned they atleast lose a lil bit of money.

The installation path for the Classic is the same as the WoW folder. Is this right? Should i install it in a different folder?
---
No procs in form though, so say goodbye to the reason people might possibly bring you to raids.
---
If you think you can kill them both, kill the higher level first. If you think you will die before killing them both, kill the lower level one first (assuming they both have about the same amount of health remaining).
---
no there is not a way of locking levels, but completing a bg did not give you xp.
---
Terrible spec.
---
Troll is fine if you want to be holy.
---
Troll is terrible if you want to be shadow for pve. You can't utilize the  troll racial well because it doesn't apply to dots, and you'll go out of mana quicker from mind flay spam, and shadow is constantly fighting against going oom. 
---
Undead is far superior in pvp because of devouring plague, and will of the forsaken. IT's not even close.
---
Real men terrorize horde in Orgrimaar
---
Ok thank you

Per swing.
---
Wetlands is probably your best bet. Super fast access to both IF and Kalimdor with boats. That's where I usually set mine to.
---
Less than 10 servers spread across PvP, PvE,RP and the newly announced localized (french + german) servers? Sounds like a recipe for layering going from a temporary measure to permanent. Now that'd be the next nail in the coffin.
---
yeah theres two sides to me. the peaceful nature loving person and then the chaotic/self destructive slightly sadistic side that doesnt give a fuck. this is why my main is an orc lock  and my alt is a tauren druid lol. very different sides but thats me a bipolar mess.
---
Ur getting downvoted but it's true. Wow isn't truly a turn based game but it almost is. All moves are on a predictable timer. The difference is that you have positioning, LOS, and real time counters.
---
&gt; Do you know how many “guides” are out there?
---
Literally thousands.  If someone is smart enough to know what min/maxing is they are smart enough to type in.  'Min/maxing guide rogue classic wow' and literally get a MASSIVE amount of videos/guides/forum posts that will get a better/quicker answer than asking someone on a forum.
---
I totally feel that, but I’ll also feel like I’m missing out if my dps is noticeably lower than that of my human counterparts. Or in terms of PvP, I’ll feel like I’m missing out on stoneform for rogue bleeds and escape artist for frost novas. I’m not sure if night elf really brings anything beneficial to the table.
---
Typically, always kill the weakest (lowest health/armor) target first. Survival is obviously key, and you need to think about the fastest possible way to reduce the incoming damage your toon is taking. 
---
A lower level mob will have a lower chance to avoid your damage, have less health, deal less damage, etc.
---
Granted, if you have CC in your toolkit, there might be a weaker but more troublesome mob (I.e. a low armor mage npc with fireballs that hit hard) and it makes more sense to CC the "weaker" target and kill a higher Lvl but less threatening mob first.
---
Other factors include whether or not your class has an interrupt or escape mechanism that allows you to reset the fight. In the end, it's all the same concept...reduce the damage taken in the fastest way possible.
---
Think it does, but now you mention it, can not confirm.
---
I’m going to play every class except the one I’m going to main on launch... I’ll scratch all my itches, but keep the one I care about fresh.

It's pretty easy to get into the fantasy of a gnome any class if you pick up engineering.  You're a refugee and you dont have a home.  You tinker away and learn about other cultures since yours has been decimated by Troggs.
---
People have questions. Not everyone can read a guide and just understand everything. People could also just avoid those kids of threads altogether if they don’t want to be bothered by it. It amuses me when people complain about the thread then go on a 20 comment tirade. Like why even bother... just move on.
---
I'm sorry, I really don't think "people have different opinions" means its not possible to come to a conclusion about something yourself. That's not how discussion works, or textual reading in general. The 'neutrality' of authorial intent is totally open to suspicion; if a game presents a scenario where someone kills someone else, but the intent is to lead the viewer to believe both sides are culpable in some way, we're able to disagree or come to our own conclusion. The fact that other people might not come to the same conclusion as we do doesn't mean that the conclusion itself is automatically murky - it *might* in fact be murky and dubious and difficult to pinpoint, but that itself is a conclusion, not separate from any other. Saying "both sides are morally gray" is not less of an opinion than "one side is in the wrong". By saying that it's impossible to come to a definite conclusion, you are not arguing the impossibility of conclusions, but putting forth your own.

4 years ago you posted about being in your senior year of highschool which would've put you between 6-8 years old in 2004-2006, how exactly were you so experienced in the level 60 bg queue times?
---
I’ve been listening to this podcast for the past few days and I stumbled upon this episode (weirdly relevant). For those unfamiliar, in brief, Hakkar applies a debuff that would spread to anyone nearby. Due to an unintended bug the debuff found itself outside of the raid and quickly and uncontrollably spread throughout the major cities. Should be a fun listen if you haven’t heard anything about the event!
---
Yes it can be, perhaps not so much overall as on the pull. Initial attack misses -&gt; 3s wait before you can do anything, with aggro going everywhere. Survivability might also be an issue on some pulls. I'd reccomend keeping a 1h+shield around.
---
This is delusional. Warlocks do not do as much damage as fire mages.
---
First off, being hit capped in Naxx means you aren't fully geared. The warlock BiS is not hit capped, only the blues that are second best are. Warlocks need a holy fuckton of help to deal 1.8k with a shadowbolt. Considering shadow weaving and dsac for the highest damage, they still need about 1200 fucking spell power to hit 1.8k on a shadow bolt. Gear is important and it is a detriment to have to use blues into Naxx.
---
Second, considering the ignite mage gets power infusion, critting as fire provides an unholy amount overall raid dps. Moreover, a mage hits 2000 damage fireball crits with 1000 spell power. Seems kind of unfair that the warlock needs significantly more spell damage in your hypothetical, especially when he's stuck wearing blues unless he has fucking BiS.
---
Third, mages have -30% threat from fire spells while a warlock has nothing except the option to flush his dps down the toilet by speccing MD/ruin. The mage dealing 10% more damage without being the igniter than the lock rarely has to worry about aggro while the lock turns into a gimp that deals BWL levels of dps in any threat intensive fight. This includes Patchwerk where we deal hunter dps. 
---
Fourth, Mages have MQG and combustion to help get their ignites rolling. Warlocks have....ToEP. To add to that, mages can start the fight with a low rank mana shield and their 70% pushback resist to deal great damage from the get go. Warlocks push shadow bolt and hope it doesn't get resisted and the boss doesn't have any off damage.
---
I can go on all day, but warlocks don't outdps fire mages. They bring a whole ton of shit, but they don't bring damage. Mage stacking gets better per mage while warlocks start losing marginal utility fast after number 3. 
---
Shit, there's a ton of thing locks can do for a raid, but bringing more damage than a mage isn't one of them.
---
P.S. Shadow bolt hits harder than frostbolt  because warlocks have a higher multiplier in talents (1.15 vs 1.09), have shadow weaving, have 5% higher spell damage coefficient, and don't run oom. Warlocks deal 300 dps in greens and blues. Fuck, when we get hit capped in ZG/BWL gear, we do more dps than the shitty frosties.
---
Yes and how many contradict each other? Some of them are wrong. It’s possible to have heard about min/maxing and nit fully understand it. People learn differently.
---
Thatsjustfuckedup
---
You do you =)

I agree that this will happily run the game, but I'd try having a look at Mini-ITX if you're tight on space. I switched from a full-size tower a few years back, and my current setup is pretty tiny. Means you can self-build, which is definitely cheaper. Maybe worth a look!

People care about corehound belt.
---
That's a fuckton of healers. No wonder there were 10+ minute kills in vanilla, yikes.
---
1/grp suggests 8 healers, which in turn suggests that you should have a roster of about 12 to be in a good place.
---
If your issue is them being wrong, which most of them really aren't and generally just tell you the pros and cons of each race, then why in the fuck would asking random people on a forum be any more accurate than someone who did the research enough to make a 15 minute video breaking down every aspect of the class?
---
Your logic makes no fuckin sense whatsoever.
---
&gt; Exploration is never a good strat, level 10, **no gear no money no skills**
---
Incorrect. I ended that video above at level 10 with:
---
- Flight points - Stormwind, Sentinel Hill, Lakeshire, Ironforge,  Thelsamar, Menethil Harbor, Auberdine, Darnassus
---
- **All skills trained** (aside from Seal of the Crusader, it's useless)
---
- Four 6 slot bags purchased from bag vendor (40 bag slots total)
---
- 7 Silver 53 Copper left over. Plenty to grab a stack of water and start some traditional leveling or grinding.
---
- Mail quest rewards in almost all equipment slots (no belt, accidentally sold gloves, and I got a sweet 2 int 1 stam dress, so I decided to wear that)
---
- 15.5 Character Sheet DPS.
---
I had full gear, the best weapon available, all skills trained, and 27s left over, enough to buy four 6 slot bags, stacks of water, and was in a great position to move on to level 11 content.
---
Dude they removed spell vulnerability before 1.12. I did as much damage in fucking BWL/ZG gear like 9 months into the game as the best locks did in Naxx shit because of that.
---
The funny thing is hunter and paladin are the two classes I am definitely not playing. Played hunter back in classic, and will be playing horde so no paladin. I did love my hunter at the time though.
---
I'm doing that on stream right now
---
Plz don't make useless replies ty
---
Yeah I feel like I could put indefinite amounts of time into a shaman. Heal 5 mans/raids and what not at 60 while simultaneously getting gear for the other specs.
---
1.12 with cross-realm bgs came out in august 2006 while you were 9 years old. Did you skip elementary school?
---
I am fully aware of how shitty grinding soul shards is, but I am still sticking with Warlock because I love the class so much. It really feels like the dps class with the most variety in playstyles and specs, it never gets old to me.
---
Not sure I agree.

For example, am I the only one who thinks rogue t3 is the best looking rogue set? Probably not. But asking this question is a bit awkward.

Click the blizzard logo at the top left, update en restart launcher. The "Version" box appeared afterwards
---
Theres nothing concrete, and I imagine it’ll be more than 10 when you consider the other regions. My reasoning is they stated there wouldnt be rppvp servers at launch because they would have limited servers at the beginning
---
you are self discipline
---
Guide already points out where to go. And I didnt get questie to work as I wanted. My tracked quests appeared in the middle of the screen.
---
Still not sure if pvp or pve server

Sounds more like they're not enjoying it and telling themselves they do is just to cope with all this time they waste doing all this pointless crap.
---
In a serious guild, one hunter will run full t2 for the 8 set.  Full T1 is technically better as long as one hunter is providing the armor debuff, IIRC.  Regardless, it's an item that Hunters can, should, and will roll/spend DKP on.  It's just good, and Onyxia isn't always kind.  If you're behind 2 hunters waiting for t2 helm to drop and you have a chance to win this, why wouldn't you?  
---
I had it on my hunter in Vanilla!
---
Bit of a late response, but you can actually just rename the beta directory from \_classicbeta\_ to \_classic\_ and then when you update it'll only download a tiny little bit. Probably not super important, but worth it in case you want to avoid the download :)
---
Of course I was in school, I also had retarded amounts of free time because I was young. My first 60 was a hunter, with tons of time it wasnt hard to level, I just followed thottbot and grinded
---
If i'm lying, feel free to dislike the video.  
---
Its actually not clickbait.
---
Yes, but that doesn't have an effect on their abilities in combat.
---
It gave significantly less.  I hit 60 in an UBRS run initially.
---
You do more damage and take more damage, rage shouldnt be an issue, which means threat shouldnt either.
---
Wanna go for a drink later?
---
Thanks for that too. Download finished quick but this is useful info for anyone with data caps etc
---
Simple, I play the day after release.
---
Have to have the key.
---
People play games differently including different goals and enjoyment. I will be rushing to 60 because I enjoy the time spent at endgame and making my character better through gear/mounts/etc.
---
I've seen "Enjoy it" from half the threads here. I will enjoy it, at 60.
---
i really hope people dont use websites like that one, i dont know about all the classes but i will say for warrior tanks and hunter the items are not correct.  
---
Tanks need hit chance so items like boa are BIS instead of dark iron ring etc.  Gearing for tanks in general is more situational and they will need multiple pieces of gear per slot.  The same thing can be said about hunter, BOA will never go to a hunter if you are in a competent guild same with DFT.  
---
So i really hope there isnt a situation where people look at websites like this one and just expect to get certain pieces of loot just because they are technically "bis" even though you can realistically never get them.

A group of level 60s could not raid in outlands, unless you are talking about outlands being brought down to 60.  The glancing and crushing blows would destroy a raid.
---
To add to number 5- what did you enjoy most about it?
---
Warlocks are pretty much designed to outlast enemies. At some levels depending on how recently you got a new spell rank, Sacrifice can effectively double your health. Succubus CC is pretty unique in that you can CC people even when you are stunned. 
---
Druids and Rogues are pretty good since they can pick good fights and just run from bad ones sometimes. 
---
Priests are pretty good, too. Disc and shadow priests are really hard to kill 1v1. Warlocks only beat them by casting drain mana and outlasting them.
---
Good pvp spec but 20/31/0 will be stronger in PVE after you reach hitcap
---
99% true.
---
Playing two it's not that likely you get camped, and if you do take a break do a dungeon and it's over.

Not at all (unless you're planning to speed level?). Being two should help, though if he's an ass I could also see him sitting in stealth watching you get killed.

People are just wildly guessing on the server count, but most have low expectations. This is primarily the case because Blizzard has repeatedly shown to have little interests in Classic via:
---
* Not marking it as a major release in their marketing plan for the year
---
* Making no real attempts to advertise the incoming release
---
* Not giving it a separate tab in the Battle.net launcher
---
* Attempting to put all of EU on the same language group, presumably expecting that there aren't enough French/German people to fill servers
---
* Repeatedly stating that they do not believe there to be sufficient interest in an RP-PvP realm to launch one
---
This has basically led everyone to assume that Classic will be super niche and that after the initial explosion of tourists from retail we'll just be on life support or something.
---
Personally I think that it's gonna pan out exactly as you say. Blizzard is going to think that like 80-90%+ of players are tourists and find themselves unable to shut down layering because far too many people stuck.
---
Blizzard is well aware of magey's github.
---
what if I play a human rogue? I am guessing I can avoid all this?
---
Yes I'm on this patch. Updating to the B.net beta also didn't do anything.
---
Setup my addons an ui. Test /world sjw's. Log off
---
Evo's are superior anyways
---
If someone wants to min max and comes to reddit to do that, they arnt going to be min maxing.
---
How long do the consumables take to farm? Is a farming class a good idea to have long term - hunter, lets say?
---
It's like a reverse Disney story. Employee has a great moment instead of a park visitor!
---
I didn't participate in any stress tests.
---
&gt; the guild exploded thanks to 4 Horseman and our tanks being retarded with massive egos.
---
Good times.
---
Lowest first. Higher hit chance in addition to less hp/armor so less time to kill usually plays a bigger part in survival than the extra damage taken from a higher lvl mob.
---
All of em pvp frags
---
&gt; Can you reset an instance while inside, log out, then get placed at the entrance in the classic client like it works on pservers?
---
Yes, with help.
---
- Invite someone else to party
---
- Logout
---
- Partner resets instance
---
- You log in at the entrance
---
I'm completely up to date and still nothing.
---
That was them when they took down Nostalrius haha

My wife listens to this podcast and introduced me to this episode a while back since she knows I was excited about WoW: Classic.  Considering most of us here have probably voraciously consumed any and all relevant information about the game, I was aware of a lot of what they covered, but its a great podcast in general.  If you like medical history you should check out their stuff.
---
Yeah.  My wife and I were just talking about that the other day... when I was a kid, my parents took us to Disneyland.  It was the "slow season," February.  The longest we waited in line for a ride was about twenty minutes, and while the evening show was going on, there were so few people on the rides the attendants would let us just stay on if we wanted to go again.  We also got a complimentary VIP thing from our hotel that let us into various areas of the park a couple hours before the general public to skip the lines.
---
From what I hear, there's no longer such a thing as a slow season, and the VIP "skip the line" pass thing now just pisses me right off because it isn't just an upgrade for the people that have them, but one that makes everyone else's experience worse.
---
Exactly the same for me. But still no dropdown menu where I can select Classic.
---
I don't even think they'll need to advertise for it on launch. Word of mouth and twitch exposure will take care of having absolutely stacked servers. 
---
6 months in? Well, that's when they can do with some teasers for when "new" content is about to drop etc. so people come back to it who might have dropped it in the meanwhile.
---
That's because as time went, people became more entitled. A lot of kids started playing WoW and they sucked at the game so they whined to Blizzard to make it easier and that's the story on how we got to where Retail currently is.
---
Will play horde for Nostalgia till maybe later 20ish then go alliance for an experience I never had.
---
I'm completely up to date. Still no Classic.
---
The problem with the Water Temple in the original N64 version was that you could accidentally get into a state where you actually couldn't finish the dungeon. There's a point where you have a key and have a couple options of doors to open, and if you pick the wrong one by accident you can't get anymore keys to open the rest of the doors.
---
I suppose this is true, in it's way.  But look again at your post.  "I'm asking for HIS opinion NOT the majority..."  Actually his opinion is more likely to be the same as the majority's as not by definition.
---
And even after reading his post you somehow were not sure on where he stood on the issue and choose to interpret his response as hostile instead of helpfull...being sarcastic and snippy dosn't really help get you closer to your objective (assuming that objective is to get an idea of where people stand and why on your question) and probably works against you.
---

4hr AV queue isnt fun.

Basically if your friend is okey healing the dmg, yes. Elsewise put a shield on and start shield blocking after your good on threat

What? You can literally press find raid and raid.

Is this a joke?

1-10 strats?
---
Are u srs?

Just play and enjoy the damn Game xD
---
Wasn't Tumblr already filled with autists?
---
Yeah but I thought the cosmetics which this thread is about were top notch at the time of their release.
---
Fuck no.
---
True, but it has less impact if you're an in-demand role like tank or healer.
---
Flight-locked content has not been a thing since Wrath afaik. 
---
Yes there are places to explore that you need flying for, but everything since Cata has been designed with multiple avenues of access (top of Uldum pyramids, the north-east village in Kun-Lai, the place where AU-Velen sacrifices himself, the mountain forge in Highmountain, etc. can all be accessed without flying.
---
Even if I am missing places that do require flying to get to, its by no means "a lot". I actually think they should add more of these places. It's why flying in BC wasn't as bad as in the following expansions, imo.
---
The 5$ droplet will do just fine for anyone unless your bot gets super big. There are also cheaper alternatives from other providers.

I have 100 days play time on my Paladino for Vailla. I was also a raid leader with server first AQ 40 opening with mount.
---
Read? No I had an addiction to it.
---
Nope, just a bunch of mindless sheep defending the status quo.
---
40 now. 3 kids and a wife but still have all my hair. Raided in vanilla, Naxx almost killed us. Excited to get back in raiding and happy I'm not bald or have grey hair at 40
---
Duskwood is an absolute gem
---
Most of the time people wont attach each other because both want to quest. But i couldnt imagine playing a PvE realm. Playing in contestee zones will always make you look around while fighting mobs.
---
there really isn't much of a storyline in vanilla.
---
But you specifically made this post about pserver players, as if playing on these servers somehow makes you an assholes...
---
Is it though? I'd rather have 1 button I use 85% of the time and have 15/20 other buttons that round it out, than have 5 buttons I use 100% of the time. 
---
In the former case, good players differentiate themselves by knowing how and when to use the utility side of their toolkit. In the latter, differentiation occurs because of gear or because of things outside of the ability toolkit (better communication, better understanding of mechanics)
---
I would recommend thoroughly exploring the world. This will give you absolutely endless hours of entertainment.
---
That’s the name of the addon.
---
I made a NE warrior upon opening the game(this was feb of 2005) then made an orc shammy which I took to 60.
---
Before TBC launched I had also leveled a warlock to 60.
---
&gt;I'm saying that if you are a figurehead for the classic wow community you should want to be very careful of who it is you give your platform to, thats all.
---
They should have been doing that the whole time. Statistically there have to be some pretty terrible people playing retail. 
---
Your post suggests that PS have a higher percentage of racist. That's not self evident and pointing one guy out isn't going to prove it.
---
iTT:
---
"where get classic??"
---
"in client go to pulldown menu"
---
"not there now what?"
---
"update client/be in US not EU/random missinformation"
---
Lol and like I said before there are limits to what I am willing to take. I said some meme specs not all of them.
---
I'm not saying that you shouldn't, but the vast majority of players doesn't care about any of this stuff, and it doesn't influence their pet decisions.
---
I farmed consumables by herbing and running strat live runs during the week, as OT you dont need to be flasked except for maybe progressing, and you dont need as many greater stoneshield potions compared to main tank, so I don’t see the point for a farming character.
---
Sure after few months you can make an alt that can farm gold more easily and have fun, but the time to level a new character can be used on your main by farming gold and getting more used to your new class and tanking role (strat live, ironfoe runs if you are human, running ubrs to gear guild and farm titans flask recipe)
---
Most items don't gear nerfed. The only items that get nerfed is tank gear. Let me use a specific example of how 1.12 itemization hurts the game. Say I'm playing a warlock in p2. Robe of volatile power is my best in slot chest piece. This is a highly contested item used by multiple classes. It has a low droprate so when one drops it going to your best most dedicated dps. But why would I pop consumables and tryhard as a warlock for a chance at robe of volatile power when I can just wait til BWL is released and use my t2 chest? During actual vanilla t2 warlock chest was garbage until patch 1.10. In classic it will be on par with robe of volatile power in phase 3. By upgrading the gear earlier than it was intended you've taken content away from me. No loot council is gonna give this chest to a warlock now. Why even bother tryharding? This is just one specific example but it applies to a bunch of item slots for pretty much every class.
---
The industry as a whole, activision blizzard included, have become extremely greedy. There is a practice running rampant that uses subtle psychological manipulation to target people with compulsion issues and addictive/overspending issues. The lovely industry term for them is “whales”. 
---
It is more beneficial to them to have 1 fat whale than 20 normies. Let me put it this way: you or I may have spend money on a race change there, a server Hope here, but people with underlying compulsions issues spend more money than they have, and have to be kept alive by family. 
---
So yes we all quit for very good reasons, but in this day and age (where it is not about good quality or gameplay first but about the next profit count) we simply don’t matter enough. It’s a worrying and shitty trend that has negatively influenced a ton of people and cost us untold amounts of would-be-good games :/
---
Even just playing through the Starcraft and Starcraft 2 campaigns will remind you how well blizz used to make games
---
delivery quests.
---
you can do fetch quests while exploring.
---
- The Fargodeep Mine (run into the mine and go back) gives 1.25s
---
- The Jasperlode Mine (run into the mine and go back) gives 3.50s
---
Exploration / FedEx isn't **strictly** exploration, it's just focused on shit that can be done with 0 competition. 1 person on the server or 100,000, you can still walk into a mine and finish the quest. Hell it's easier with more people cause there's no mobs.
---
Oof. 
---
It shows that he gets punched in the head for a living.
---
Right, good point on Twitch there, and yea Minion is out of date but it works for Classic. I'm not sure why I got downvoted on my earlier post
---
Arena, better rotations and skills were all a step up, but flying and the introduction of dailies were a major step back.
---
PvE servers are a joke. PvP server the real deal. There you get both
---
and be prepared to be in a bunch of blacklist, if you pretend just to stick to the run until certain boss then left after the item u wanted didnt drop...
---
No i've played on the pservers and there's plenty of lovely people! But there is also an ultra toxic racist community that doesnt get banned because its a pserver and they will be joining the classic community shortly, just figured id make a psa.
---
I got downvoted earlier but WoW interface has a Classic section
---
You're not a *real* Boomer until you crash the economy!
---
I wouldn't suggest it for solo leveling, if that's what you mean by "terrible"
---
I started out with a druid but rerolled to I don't even remember what, maybe pally, but didn't make much difference since short after I switched factions and found my class for the next 4 years, warlock.
---
I hated arena's too but that's where the meta was. My point stands in Bags and world pvp as well.
---
You'll be fine, PvP is alot of fun. 999 out of 1000 won't corpse camp you.
---
Yeah, exactly what I was about to post. Blizz always listened to the community, that is how we got flying mounts, dungeon finder, and the heavy focus on end game content.
---
The thing about the pservers is that some of them have been ultra toxic racists for years with no ramifications because there is no enforcement on pservers and that if you are going to be giving them platforms to speak, just be careful as to not hurt you own reputation.
---
I agree. Half way through wrath is where the current philosophy of wow started coming through with dungeon finder and stuff. Honestly the main reason i am looming forward to classic is so i can play bc again
---
It's funny, in The WoW Diary there's a passage that talks about how they specifically *didn't* hire suits and people that weren't gamers. Times sure have changed
---
Ironic post, because if you would have actually read what OP wrote, you'd know that:
---
He's not advocating to ostracize someone, because they played on a private server, but because they are apparently a racist piece of shit.
---
15 to 20 took Joana over 5 hours. Since I'm doubling Joana's time to better estimate casual play, yes, 5 hours for 15 to 17 is roughly correct.
---
So...El Paso?
---
Yep, as a fellow private server guy, fuck those assholes. If they get the boot from the general community, good riddance.

No thankx.

Naxx gear must be the optimum. I could live with parallel content on the same gear level or slightly under. 
---
I don’t have time to be forced to chase a rising loot spiral.
---
"money where their mouth is"?
---
This is a phrase used when someone is all words and not action. How have they expressed they want to make an advertisement campaign for Classic but not done so?
---
Lol
---
"I could only win if I could kill people before they could really react to me, its not fair that PvP requires thinking and reaction, it should just be who sees who first!"
---

Just log onto a private server and join /world chat. Then do the same thing for retail.

The biggest leveling guild on one of the big launches a while back was called Naga Stole my Bike.

Go play on a private server made by yourself. You won't have to "vet" anyone.
---
It will be better once you get Sanctuary if you can take enough mobs at once. It won't be fast, sure, but it'll be fine and more fun than Ret if it's what you want to do.
---
If you have enough HP and a good Shield+1H you'll be totally fine. You may be more vulnerable to the Horde attacking, though, without a good 2h+SoC procs.
---
In my experience most of those snap/warp to center issues are because the default is to not use raw mouse input.
---
If you have those issues, I recommend enabling raw mouse input to see if they go away:
---
/rawMouseEnable 1
---
Except your pet runs out of focus spamming it, so it only does slightly more dps.

I didn’t pay a sub through legion but in bfa they drastically cut the passive gold accrual. I stopped my sub until classic because the game wasn’t worth paying for

But when you aren't rage capped a faster weapon will help generate more rage will it not?

OP what if I told you some retail players are like this too?

Really makes you think, huh?
---
Welcome to 2019 where saying expletives makes you a white supremacist.  Thanks Obama
---
There are people who get banned on private servers. It depends on the server. There's also tons of toxic people playing retail, they just limit it a bit. 
---
Tons of WoW players came from Diablo 2, original SC, and wacraft2. Diablo 2 scamming was constant and nobody got banned for it. There was a UMS map on SC 1 that was called "dodge the rapist" where characters like "Michael Jackson", "raging penis" or some other more favoured ones, would hunt you down. 
---
I hate to tell you this but ,this isn't a private server thing.
---
For England it’s the 12th August 11pm GMT. You can use google to see what time 11pm GMT is for you.

Absolutely nobody thinks of LFR as proper raiding in BFA. It’s a free loot roulette.

---
Hate the shaman has been gaining so much attraction. Partly why i love the class is that is nuisance to find a good one.  Might go tanking shaman and avoid all the novelty.
---
Lol jk see you in dungeons when im /cast Chain Healing yall
---
Most guilds are advertised in chat. If you want to join a random one, you’ll most likely get a random invite from some social guild.
---
That doesn't count, no faction is in any way dominant over the other there.
---
shit
---
Which is exactly what the post he’s complaining about was saying too lol
---
Let's leave the children out of this.
---
;)
---
This is possibly the most idiotic post I’ve ever seen on here. Well done.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and always wanted to play a druid.
---
They can stealth like a rogue, but also heal and tank. They also take some effort to play well, whereas a rogues are pretty easy when you have cds and useless without them
---
I don’t know why but I have missed insect swarm so much.
---
The best of times.
---
:D the more you know
---
The question wasn't what's fun, but what's the fastest, though! :) And that's dungeon farm, even with travelling times, if you plan a good route where you can do some fast elite quests while travelling.
---
Now you see the evolution of everything. From art creation to social revolution. Anyrhing good turns to shit by snake humans.
---
That’s awesome. Honestly, I simply got excited for you reading this lol.
---
Duskwood is great, I think Humans just have a really strong 1-30 experience in general.
---
If i roll a nightelf druid for mainly pvp, how much will i regret not having warstomp?
---
If you want to feel battle tension and amazing atmosphere go pvp. But there will be griefing but also the best kind of atmosphere
---
The problem is that eventually a company has to hire people who specialize in "suit" things, such as budgets, HR, legal...all that.
---
The challenge after that is keeping the soul of the company while replacing the original leadership team and bringing in the aforementioned "suit specialties".
---
Bro, I'm not sure how to tell you this but your estimations of a warlock doing less than 400 DPS in Naxx gear is beyond fallacious.
---
Literally an enhancement shaman does more than 400 DPS in Naxx gear.
---
&gt; ike say for a WSG what would the ideal 10 classes be?
---
10 boomkins.
---
I am going to level feral and go boomy late game, i am not a masochist
---
The evolution of everything.
---
&gt; He's providing unsubstantiated claims that he can't find any proof to back up.
---
Funny, I spent several hours to find proof and linked them. So far ppl who disagreed with me couldn't give me a single proof, just hearsay.
---
Yikes. No way I'd ever join &lt;DOGZ&gt;.
---
not nearly as much as rolling a druid for pvp.
---
Lore wise TBC is the lowest point in wow history
---
Is this like a phasing thing?
---
Who's talking about one hit kills? I'm talking about resilience turning pvp into a slow, dull borefest. ESPECIALLY if you add a resto druid or priest to the mix.
---
There's no skill in ability rotation you stole off of Google. OrangeMarmalade would deserve the credit for creating the optimal mage rotation, not you or I.
---
Yes. This does work on classic and I used in classic quest add-ons
---
Showering is not an obligation to play classic, old man.
---
Right, therefore everyone who's ever played on on a pserver is a racist piece of shit...
---
To some people being able to damage or heal in any capacity means you are viable. Regardless of the semantics, there is no real counter argument against class balance being awful in classic. TBC and WoTLK greatly improved on it.
---
That's a good point. They should keep Trials to Retail WoW.
---
Hell, you're old enough to be my Dad!!
---
I played the last stress test at 3440x1440 with no problems.
---
I believe that 8k is the highest resolution possible right now.
---
Can't be Duskwood.  It has sunlight.
---
The idea would be to tank with your arms spec &amp; 2-hander but using defensive stance. You wouldn't just try to tank in battle stance the whole time.
---
100% does sound like clickbait, though. With  „I’m almost sure...“ I would have given it a try.
---
Go for an Amd 2600 with a gtx 1660ti and around 16gb of ddr4 2400.  Look for a mb thats around $100.  A budget pc like this is way more than enough for classic.
---
This. Unless you wanna be a wsg flag bot in 12 months or whenever phase 3 happens druid sucks in pvp
---
To you it sounds like it. To others it doesn't...

Man I haven't followed the sub or anything for around a month, just recently downloaded the launcher and saw WoW Classic listed under Live.

I was like, "Holy fucking shit, it launched early and I missed out!"
---
I was sad and happy when I got hit with the "No realms available" error
---
Ok great to know. Thanks guys!
---
That is how some people enjoy the game.
---
It can handle 1440p, most likely the game can handle any "normal" resolution your monitor supports.
---
I'd personally prioritize 1440p over 144Hz, but then again my monitor has both :P

Thanks!

Off topic but I always appreciate how you're on top of all these threads to promote your strategy and also appreciate the work you've done to develop it.  Doing any final testing during the last stress test next week?
---
You think its about the dps rotation? Good lord, you really did not pvp much huh?
---
You killed people by coordinating around their cooldowns and your cooldowns, positioning mattered, cc mattered, prediction mattered, timing mattered. Your ability rotation wasn't what mattered.
---
I'm going to pay for both to and hope for a good sale in the next couple weeks ;)
---
Someone downvoted you? Heck, I upvoted your post as soon as I saw it. Extremely useful information! Please keep that coming and don't be daunted by trolls.
---
Swords is better like 90% of the time, at late late game daggers pull ahead but require better play
---
Cinemas my dude. Put it in Cinemas. That's where people are excited for whatever they're going to watch already. Bring it before Rom-Coms for couples, kids movies for the dads and every other movie you can find.

I lost wow to the children... don’t worry we’re getting it back
---
Good idea. Im about to make a thread to convince people to not play resto shaman.
---
Low charisma replying to high charisma
---
Well some people don’t respond well to non fun things which is why I said that. I know people who would do a few dungeons and get off because leveling was boring that way where as others would do quests and level multiple times a day. Talking current wow not classic because it’s not out.
---
Feel free to point out where I specified that warlocks did more damage than the ignite rolling mage.  
---
Secondly, specify where I said that they did more damage than mages at all in that post.  
---
You'll find neither, because the entire post was to address that the claim of warlocks doing less damage than a hybrid spec is mathematically impossible. It's also mathematically impossible for the non-ignite mages to do TWICE the damage of a warlock. I don't mind arguing my point but don't try to twist the narrative to imply that I've typed something I haven't.  
---
Of course warlocks are more mechanically limited, most importantly regarding threat and the inherent modifiers that warlocks have, but none of that equals to doing HALF the damage of a non-ignite fire mage.  
---
It doesn't matter what kind of narrative you try to spin, it mathematically does not fucking happen if given equal skill players.
---
And you think a pug can casually complete MC and that its easier. That right there is a ridiculous statement. I raided on 3 toons every week in Vanilla. and a raid laider. Vanilla raids were hard. You had to join a voice chat(most pugs wont dont this) leading to whipes because there are mechanics that require communication. Your group falls apart slowly and you just wasted hours of your time to kill a couple bosses and get no loot.
---
Hey now, most millenials are in their 20s and 30s it's the generation after us that get called millenials.. and real millenials hate them.
---
Yes that is my username. Please no more useless replies, thank you
---
I tend to save the long dungeons for the weekend and quest, craft, pvp, raid during the weeknights. It does suck spending 3 hours of your evening in a dungeon just for it to fall apart.

45 and i am back with the beginnings of arthritis and slower reaction time. My son was a first grader when i started wow now he is a successful adult and instead of him riding my mount around Darnassus for fun he will be raiding along with me and admittedly a better player.
---
Except he is specifically calling out pserver players as if only they can be racist...
---
&gt; Four Horseman video doesn't even have a damage meter anywhere and is from a resto druid PoV.
---
You can count the number of locks in the raid, I believe.
---
&gt;You've basically made a thread that will actively scare away players from playing what they want, and all you've provided are unsubstantiated claims and videos that have a quadrillion variables behind them that are completely unknown.
---
Funny, you dismissed all my evidence, but you cann't give any to counter my claims. And you dont have to be a genius to figure out, when you dont see lock in multiple boss kill from that time, then they were really bad.
---
I plan on starting mining/herb at the start too. I think most people will be going skinning so the market will likely be flooded. I also plan to save enough materials to level blacksmithing and alchemy 1-300 once I hit 60.
---
Can’t you potentially make a lot of money off Eve?

go pve.  the privateserver  ppl are largely cancerous dbags that thrive on corpse camping and killing lowbies.   if you want to play with mature players, then go pve.

I'm not doing that solo as a warrior.  But as a warrior, you just run living strath runs and claim first Orb can either round robbin the next or just /random yourself into getting possibly a second one as well.  Phase 2, you can do DM jump runs.

So again, if you think by phase 3 you're still going to be poor, you're not MMO'ing correctly.  There are plenty of ways to be making gold in the game, even for a casual player (in this case warrior).
---
By the end of phase 1 I'm also going to be leveling up either a Druid or Shadow Priest and I'll be able to solo Mauradon to vendor items for 30g an hour on the unlucky end of the RNG and up to 50g on the top end, solo. So either way, I'll have a solo or group farming options available.
---
Everyone is "hating" (for no reason everytime obviously, btw) for a leftist.
---
How you gonna handle bank and bag slots? Multiple bank Alts?
---
Let the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher take care of everything.
---
Do you just upload all the changes into your google doc? Curious as well what you’re going to do after fedex. I was thinking about dark shore but worried I’d be too far behind by the time I’d get back across to the other continent!
---
Thank you for balancing karmic energy of the sub
---
Who care about your copy paste of guides available on Internet and known of everyone ?
---
I agree, fun-wise questing is definitely ahead of dungeon farm.
---
Let's nitnworry about anything till after classic
---
Right now is a solid time to build a pc. You can my same rig for probably half of what I paid 9 months ago. I run wow on max settings with a ryzen 2600 and a vega 56, with 16 gb ddr4 3200.
---
Live to win, till you die
---
Hey there Classic fans!  I have a few character creation and realm selection questions.  Are the realm names/types/locations going to be released ahead of the early character creation?  Will there be any way to track how many characters are created for a given realm ahead of launch?  How are you going to find a good place to call home?  
---
I'm interested in PVE or maybe RP, EST server time, hosted in Chicago and hoping there's only one big one with a lot of layers instead of option overload.
---
You right. I only played pserver for MC/a few months and know nothing about gold runs/all the stuff people have learned over the years of playing vanilla servers. Back in vanilla I never heard of people doing DM runs/farming Mara. But fury warriors were also rare even in AQ40 and Edgemasters probably sold for 10g because nobody knew the vanilla back then.
---
Tbh I just couldn't be bothered to spend that much time farming gold for an extra 3% for meters when I only pve to PvP and using my gold for respec costs.
---
I find it funny that some people are so afraid of quitting jobs they hate because of the uncertainty that follows, and you just quit because you'd rather play Eve online - I'll remember if I ever end up having a job I hate
---
Not if they're killing all the quest NPCs, and low lvl stealth is really weak.
---
The girl I was dating Freshmen year went home to Finland for the summer of 05 and I was bored so I played WoW at my friends suggestion. It was my first real pc mmo ( I played PSO and FF XI on consoles) and I got hooked. By the time the fall semester started I already down the rabbit hole.
---
Long story short joined a raiding guild that cleared content regularly and I almost hit rank 13 pvping. My social life went to shit, my grades dropped to a 3.1, and I lost a great girl who still tried to deal with my bullshit. I started drinking, I stopped going go the gym and I ate junk food like a slob.
---
Thankfully I got my act together after graduated.
---
Please do elaborate.
---
If you're playing a holy paladin in PvP and you're in a 1 on 1 situation, is it worth it to switch to a 2H weapon during the hammer of justice stun since the enemy has no avoidance and they cant retaliate?  Of course you'd switch back once the stun ended.
---
There will be more of it than even at retail because many veterans will come back and many guides for people that want to be best at pvp.
---
I never have the arrow except when I’m dead. The arrow only ever showed up for me when i right click the quest tracker. That’s the pserver version though I can’t imagine it’s super different.
---
No. What matters is being quick. Arms allows you to be in the right stance in evevry situation. It mainly shines at level 30 when you get sweeping strikes and can yolo tank.
---
You don't even need to learn revenge as long as you are not underleveled.
---
Could consider going 25/5/0 first and then respeccing to sweeping strikes (5% crit is huge). You might want a few points in Tactical Mastery, though at around Wailing Caverns.
---
I’m not sure you understand what charisma is.
---
&gt;Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour.
---
show me on video where that is like this guide. I bet you wont find a single one.
---
just educated guess type #s.
---
You play your way and we’ll play ours.
---
Lol ok. I’m sure people who arnt even smart enough to google proper guides are totally going to end up min max when asking reddit. 
---
Imagine not even using google or the reddit search bar but then also say you’re trying to play a character at full potential.
---
Still gotta think of Layering. It's gonna be bad, but not too bad. At the beginning me &amp; my mates will just party with as many people as possible.
---
As soon as you get out of the first Zone things start to get better. Should always prioritize kills over quest-loot, because you will get the loot anyways. After you hit 10 people are going to spread out even more because there will be more and more different spawns. So as long as you can reinvite people to a 5-man you're good.
---
Then the first dungeons come and this is where it gets interesting. Some will quest, some will grind the Dungeon. A mixture is probably best.
---
But on top of all strategies and crazy ideas people will have, the only important strategy is what differentiates a casual from a hardcore addict: How long do you play after start. I know I'll be in for at least a whole day. If it's entertaining enough I might even skip/delay sleep. This is how you get a head-start and leave the crowd.
---
Wow can’t wait to see you repeat the cycle! I mean...
---
Oh, Shaman.
---
31/0/20 or something is a pvp dmg and pve healing spec in the same.
---
No respec, healer, so pug invites.
---
When you do want to Respec for enhance, you can for melee
---
Warlocks are God tier with PVP. I remeber taking down multiple 60s on st the same time
---
I think most will understand but the best thing is saying before entering a dungeon that you have a kid so the group leader can decide whether to invite or not. That way nobody gets annoyed if something happens. Win win
---
Here is the thing: You get +15 on herb skill but to be honest, I think after skinning, herbalism is the most easy skill to level. So this racial is not that big of a deal.
---
And at endgame there is no use for 315 herb skill. So better consider race aesthetics and combat racials.
---
If there was a toggle, you'd only queue into BG's with other twinks with the XP toggled off.
---
I think that they see it as an evil trick by the Lich King
---
Doing a warrior as a first character - how much will I suffer?
---
I really like tanking and I'm keen to play a warrior in the long run, but warriors are of course expensive and difficult. So I'm trying to work out if it will in fact be quicker to start with a mage / hunter / warlock just to get me a base of money with which to build the warrior I actually want to play.
---
And all of them play like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klm2Q7xu_d4
---
Impale is super bad. It only works on yellow hits, which is namely overpower. 2H spec is a tiny damage boost too, parry and imp charge are probably better for most people.
---
If you get Impale get it leading up to Mortal Strike at levels 38 and 39. It basically only boosts your Overpower.
---
&gt;remind everybody that a lot of the private server folk will be joining us.
---
Pretty sure we'll be joining them.
---
Always an alternative but STV is insane amount of exp.
---
All right, thanks. Resetting once I get there sounds good.
---
I'm gonna play a rogue and want the sword skill before I leave which costs 10s, hence lvling a bit in the human starting area before heading out.
---
Autist or troll ?
---
Its really not that bad.
---
What in the prot tree allows them to do this?
---
I remember playing my Night Elf Hunter in Westfall and listening to these few tracks on repeat:  
---
Fort Minor - In Stereo
---
Fort Minor - Remember the Name
---
Fort Minor - Red to Black
---
Fort Minor - Back Home
---
Fort Minor - High Road
---
Great news, thanks!
---
I'm going to beat this dead horse - I'm not saying that private server people are racist. I'm saying that there's a part of its community that i'm very knowledgeable about that is incredibly racist and toxic. I do not think that private server people are bad - just that this community has been around existing because they do not get banned for racism - and if they do they instantly create another account, which wont be as easy on retail. I generally do not care what they do. What I am advocating for is that if you are going to be giving them platforms to speak just be careful of who it is you associate with as to not harm your own reputation.
---
like cool story bro, your stories does not change reality
---
I'm almost on the verge of giving up video games altogether because I don't find them fun anymore... but I am willing to hold out and wait for Classic to see if it can rekindle the old flame.
---
I wouldn't mind server xfers and the like, but no mounts.
---
As to your concern about dungeon grinding to level: most dungeons cover a pretty wide level range, so you won't be able to full clear a new dungeon anyways until you've gained a few levels there. Take Deadmines for example. If you go at 16, the ship room mobs are all 19+. VanCleef is level 21. If you are there solely to grind XP, you'll probably be clearing to the Shredder or boiler room and then resetting until you are level 18. This should take like 15/20 minutes tops with a good group, even at level 16. Furthermore, you only get 5 resets per hour. So if you only have 90 minutes to play, your plan could be to complete this run 6-7 times and then stop. At level 20, an organized melee cleave group can full clear DM in less than 30 minutes.
---
Did you event read the post?
---
2.8M more heartbeats until release ermagherd!
---
If you end up on a server cluster, that is heavily about being best at PVP, you will face toxic situations a lot. But I wouldn't say that all PVP servers suck. Otherwise you should consider rolling an alt or go PVE.
---
Pvp too. You can pop the stealth detect and gank any other stealth class.
---
Correction* in vanilla. 
---
So far in classic beta his solo speed leveling times have been decent but nowhere near the fastest.
---
I think a lot of us did before we had our own accounts and computers when not having permission to play on our brothers'.
---
18 adderal and a dream to kill kel'thuzad.
---
I have tried DPI changes and it felt better, but not solved. Might try this. Thank you!
---
Be consistent in raid attendance.  Be there every time, and contribute as much as you can.  Help run people through dungeons for attunements and pre-raid bis stuff.  Being a dependable team player is the fastest way to getting those sweet professor plums (purples).
---
Yep, pserver players are largely trash humans, it is known
---
Since when was the highest dps in BWL 400 rofl?
---
LOL! Yeah, I thought that was odd, too. :) Of course, it's nice to get sympathetic responses as well. It's all good, I guess.
---
This would be evil if it works, but can a spider net someone in the air so they fall to their death?
---
You should be saying that to yourself lol
---
Except you can put them on your friends list and when you group with them, you'll be pulled to their layer.
---
Keeping in mind, it'll only even be a thing for a couple months.
---
&gt;I personally, assuming its still a cluster fuck, plan to just do dungeons non stop till 60 if it's still a clusterfuck.
---
Lol good luck, dungeons going to be like 50 hours slower... layering is a thing for a reason.
---
if they kill them you wait for them to respawn I guess which takes 20 mins?
---
No, they use a different add-on system. Classic uses the modern version.
---
Seems fair!
---
No exp at all. And you will get your enchanting level only to about a skill of 50 (out of 300) with that method. After that you will actually have to enchant things to skill up.
---
Thats why I love playing Warlock.
---
Infinite repeat.
---
Heh well I don’t see that happening. I’ve been casual since WoD and part of the thing about Vanilla back in the day was that no one knew what they were doing.
---
I’m not pvping hardcore either.
---
Why would random NPCs online be telling me this though
---
Any sources for classic addons yet? I imagine some of the beta-players were able to get their hands on addons.
---
nah just bubble hearth
---
Mind sharing what you found? :)
---
I worked with a Boy Scout camp instructor who lost a job playing too much WoW. He had sworn off WoW by the time I met him.
---
Which is exactly what you've been doing. You automatically dismiss private server videos, and the only videos you post from actual Vanilla were from druid PoVs with no damage meter, a fight with 3 warlocks that had none of them casting Shadowbolts and a few videos of a guy going over screenshots.
---
It means nothing, we can gain nothing from any of that, because we have no information regarding the warlocks in question.
---
What? We don’t make jokes? Take the stick out mom.
---
So pissed at the author right now. Idiot had to evade taxes...
---
Just give us season 3 damnit!
---
i think the fact that you felt like that was something you need to tell people to remember says a lot more about you than me.
---
Doesn't holding down both mouse buttons to rotate camera solve this?! Or is OP talking about something else?
---
Priest is better because warlocks can drain mana as well and with a priest they burn the mana of any enemy real quick while still being tanky.
---
I'm literally shaking after reading your post.
---
Not even sure if you understood the post or not. Pretty sure you misread it somehow.  
---
Unless you're saying that warlocks to less damage than healers in Naxx.
---

I expect those people will get banned in short order from Classic and go back to their pservers
---
thank you
---
Clever gnome.
---
We don't know. Most of his loot table would be considered "phase2" due to when it was added. This may be an area they adjust and we may see some of those items phase 1. I don't know that we will know for sure until someone kills him.
---
Theres a website that’s going to track streamers. Other than hoping they announce their server there’s no way if knowing.
---
Both are good. Before Dire Maul is out it is definitely better to have it in Kargath. That way you can reach all relevant dungeons within reasonable travel time. It just sucks a bit if you end up there and there's to mage to take you back to org.  
---
During Phase 2 and Phase 4 Grom'gol is actually pretty good as well for going to Dire Maul and ZG. But for raid night you want to have it in Kargath.
---
More like when Blizzard cared
---
I still remember doing a 10 man raid on deadmines so it is pretty safe bet that most if not all 5 mans could be raided with a max group size of 10, ofcourse there was exp penalty and you could not complete dungeon quests unless they were specificly tagged as raid quests.
---
Well people aren't used to thinking for themselves and the world (of warcraft) is a scary place! :P
---
You could never mine in form. Skinning should be possible though.
---
play pve to avoid the streamers and the pirated server players.  2 for 1
---
weary is a word - it basically means tired
---
We do, it's called retail
---
Don't discount the dagger tank!
---
Loving this
---
Not really. Many things in EVE cost a lot of ISK, which can be correlated to real currency because of PLEX (like WoW tokens) but it's very difficult to turn ISK into actual money.
---
Except again, the math doesn't add up.
---
You and a select few others claim this, and the only proof you guys have actually put forth can't even be analysed or considered as proof since they have no actual information in them.
---
Since you guys are arguing against the common opinion, the burden of proof is on you people to actually put forth a video or a sim of Naxx equivalent gear.
---
None of you can do so, which means everything is purely conjecture and has no basis to stand upon.
---
Come the fuck on guys, this is basic fucking stuff.
---
I won't reroll, I only play one character in an MMORPG.
---
classic wow discord or the official forums
---
Holy crap. The comments in that post are SO toxic. 
---
We should start calling people out...
---
"Vanilla sucked, The End" - Kabookie 
---
"No.
---
"Blizzard can't even support the live game properly. They don't need to split resources when the game goes over a year at a time without an update." - Caffeine 
---
"I heard about this great game called Pong. The graphics are SO GOOD." - Phurr
---
You should read twitch chat comments on any streamer when WoW classic comes up. BFA players are some of the most toxic players of any wow expansion yet, they actually put LoL players to shame. They're **SO** selfish I really cannot comprehend what makes them that way, just because they weren't a part of vanilla it must mean vanilla is *bad* and should *never happen*
---
Op, I’m one of those people you mentioned. Let me take a sec to share my view. 
---
People should play whatever they want. If they want to min max, awesome, go for it...ask for help and tons of folks will flood you with info. 
---
If you don’t want to min max and just like the way something looks, awesome, there’s advice for you too. 
---
My beef is when people want one thing and get the other. Folks should be respectful of what people want.
---
I think folks should also strive to keep an open mind because BIS can vary with a persons unique playstyle and it takes experience to recognize this.
---
Dude. All you said was “not true”
---
😂😂
---
This is a good example of the mandela effect. I also very strongly remember shards disappearing upon logout at some point in vanilla, but it turns out that's incorrect. I was so sure of it too since warlock was my first alt(thanks drakedog) and I loved that character.
---
Unfortunately I definitely want to play pvp servers.  Whats a pirated server player btw?
---
Up to you, you will get out what you put in.
---
As far as rep goes, where do you see a lot of your spillover rep? I would like to get as much darnassus rep as I can. But I don’t want to do so much bouncing around. Especially 1-20
---
There’s a lot of Classic communities that are avoiding the streamers. It’s a common agreement amongst a lot of the player base. Our Guild is going on a High Pop Server with none of those big streamers. They’ll make it known when they decided where they’re going before Name Reserve day. Plus, name reserve day is two weeks before Launch. So you’ll for sure know where they’re all going. 😀
---
Well the Hit box can make it easier to click the Tauren. Clicking a gnome among a group can be harder. Tabbing through targets doesn't make this a big deal though.
---
Did you forget about layering? I doubt youll see more than 20 people in the starting zone or any zone
---
Any idea the name of the website?  If not thanks anyway, that's a great tip.
---
Grom'Gal for access to cities. If you have the Kargoth FP it's really not too bad of a flight while your putting the groups together.
---
And counting the number of locks does.. what, exactly?
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
Also, none of your evidence is actual evidence and the burden of proof is on you to provide them.
---
It's as simple as that, everything posted in here by you and your other two buddies is just conjecture until you can back it up, because you're arguing against the apparently common opinion of the masses.
---
Within reason, if I join DM with 2 hours free time, then we lose 30 mins to some group member dicking around getting to zone, then even with 90minues we still can't finish the zone, that's on the group. Certainly make sure you have enough time,  but you don't owe a group you're whole night if they can't get the zone done in less time than the dungeon respawn timer.
---
Bug on your end probably. I can see EU both in the launcher and when I try to launch it through wow.exe
---
Too bad server transfers aren’t a thing... wait... cross realm bgs are the worst.
---
if you log in your interface folder will also appear in your wow folder, so you can 'install' addons.
---
(you obviously will get disconnected)
---
Dude i feel you. As a fellow enchanter, feels bad man. All the professions have been gutted and have very little impact on the game now. 
---
I am also a tailer and that as well has very little importance. Just bags i guess, epic gear drops left and right now days.
---
Touch of weakness is way more mana spent trying to proc it. Berserking isnt bad to pop to bust some fast heals. DP isnt just dispelled in group settings, its dispelled by dwarves and jungle remedy also which everyone should have. Trolls can also spam healing debuff curses which is actually really strong. WF is overrated counter to 2 classes
---
Absolute madlad!
---
Dude go look at vanilla logs from Chronos. Bam feral at 750 dps. Not hard man.
---
That's awesome, I'll kill two birds with one stone when I get on to reserve my name.  Thank you!
---
Rogues as well with the knives.
---
You won't get camped if you are playing at release. Leveling afterwards is a whole different story. Lvl 60s with no life were definitely a thing.
---
Now there can be a lot of disagreement on the specifics of the math but the conversion is something like this
---
5 gorillas = 1 corehound = 10 snakes = 3 ugly guys
---
Ah, good. Never bothered with bfa.
---
Forum police?  What? You're just wrong bud and I gave you some advice so you don't look like an idiot again.  Honestly I'm just trying to help.
---
Aaaah  thank you. It worked for me. I am downloading it right now.
---
I assumed there would be a special icone on the left...
---
Twitch has a pulldown menu for classic or retail. That's where I do all my addon stuff.
---
Of coarse there are shady people on Pservers. There are shady people on most all games. Retail will be better, but there will be bad apples in it as with other games. Now the fact that Pservers didn't require any money to play on, and there being much less moderation (especially on mega servers) on them. Leads to a more attractive environment for bad actors.
---
Good thing about classic is that in addition to the pay wall Blizzard is plenty willing to hand out bans and punishments for bad behavior. So the most unsavory types will likely relegate their worst behavior to 3rd party communication.
---
Pretty sure that would be the Tales Of the Past maxhinima trilogy. It even has DBZ blur fights in episode 3.
---
Troll for pve if you min max.
---
I really enjoyed it as well!
---
a lot of right wing crazies on the pservers.
---
Didn’t read any of the links but just wanted to say nice job constructing an argument with examples and references. This is a good example.
---
Is the void Walker safe though?
---
What makes classic good was that it was hard. That not everything was too obvious. That you had to try hard and overcome the content to come out on top. Everything was against you: the world, the Mobs, that enemy faction. If you quested you had to think in order to find what you were looking for and plan your approach. That was what makes it good.
---
That’s not a thing. The only page you would be able to see was the one you loaded before you lose internet. If you searched anything it wouldn’t load. The search function requires internet.
---
i played a tauren fury warrior on a private server, was constantly demeaned by my guild for it, yet beat all the other orcs in my guild and was top dps.
---
your skill will overcome any such benefit orcs have.
---
The only info so far is from a Staysafe interview with the devs where they say something along the lines of: "...there won't be like 30 servers or something.."
---
Ah yea! Looking atm. Maybe buying brand new parts.. Dont feel to comfy buying used stuff..
---
The only reason ill never play alliance is because durotar is so much better for dueling :D
---
Lol have you even tried putting that in any kind of search before commenting, theres 100s on YouTube
---
I don't have a lot of debt and I don't have kids so I'm not financially forced to have a job I hate. I also once tried burning out working a stressful job I hated resulting in depression after that, I decided would do that again just to make money.
---
Male Troll

/clap

/back peddle
---
You will slowly walk back with your large Troll arms clapping and flapping, one of the ultimate taunts. Try it in retail if you must, it looks the same in classic.
---
The world's sense of scale became immeasurably smaller. Not that I necessarily think a flight path from Winterspring to Un'goro should take 25 minutes, but having to put at least a modicum of effort in getting around definitely made the world feel a lot bigger. Flying allows you to beeline literally anywhere, taking all he interesting world design with it. That's why the first half of expansions are the ones I enjoy most, where flying isn't a thing. Inconvenient compared to flying? Absolutely. But it keeps you on your toes.
---
You can reach any point in wow to any other point within a few minutes these days. It suits the instant gratification that seems to personify what World of Warcraft (and gaming in general) has now considering the gold standard.
---
I still remember things like weighing the options of whether or not to help friends/guildies getting ganked because the 10-15 minutes it would take to get to them may have outweighed the usefulness since so much time had passed and they might have already moved on. PvE servers may not have had to deal with the issues flying presented, but trust me, it really messed up world PvP.
---
I don't think it'll be that reduced. If it is that is pretty sad actually.
---
Lolk want to do the math that show his shadow bolts end up with warr rog mage dps or something?
---
While leveling you will miss it, but once you hit 60 Night Elf is miles ahead. Shadowmeld + drink is much, much better in battlegrounds and group situations.
---
Well to start, 30 points in holy is more than enough to raid heal so IMO you should never go full holy unless you have alts in which to farm gold on, or you will be stuck to group content. 
---
In terms of the talents, a big one you get at 21 points in prot is Blessing of Sanctuary. There are talents for increasing block chance, greater block value, armour increases. On top of this there is Improved Concentration Aura which with two points in that and 4 points in tier 2 of the holy tree (can't remember the name) will give 100% reduction for knockbacks when healing. 
---
I would go for a build like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqLuMxsxVrdI0d
---
You could also go 30/0/21 I guess but I'm not to fond of retribution in vanilla.
---
Mind Control doesn't care which way you're facing lol
---
I want to take a small time out to thank you for sounding like a regular human in this sea of madness.
---
Is there a macro to unlock character via help request (make him die) ?
---
When doing so, is this usefull to undress the character (for durability) ?
---
This is actually good advice. Thanks. Not even being sarcastic. Thank you.
---
I lost my girlfriend shortly before Wrath came out because SHE got too hooked. I was too noob for her i guess LOL!
---
Not easy or legally.
---
The troll pve bonus is quite insane tbh. You either will not get much use out of it which means you have a great group and everything under control or cast whooping 30% faster in tight situations.
---
I just got hit by a mod. Look up feral dps on the log website.
---
Best bet is to pick RP server, but there is still no word on PvP RP servers.
---
Well that until they find mankrik's wife
---
The voidwalker is never safe. Poor blueberries get sacrificed at a moment's notice as soon as their warlock is in danger.
---
well it's kind of like going to a klan rally vs going to walmart.  There's a lot more racists at one than the other.

SW first for easy access to westfall, redridge, duskwood and STV. Then Menethil harbour, right at the boats to Kalimdor, short flight to IF. You don't want to be questing in Kalimdor without a hearthstone back to EK. At 60 you can go back to SW for easy access to BRM dungeons and raids.
---
I don’t care what you think of me. None of this matters and doesn’t have anything to do with real life. Nice try though.
---
O.k, yer I miss used that term, but otherwise the sentiment is the same.
---
Cool
---
I'm rolling two toons.
---
What is 
---
&gt;/back paddle
---
I've never seen this emote? Also I assume u meant peddle but i still am curious? Maybe I can YouTube it? 
---
I play on ND private serv so I can try it on there even, when I get home. What's the proper vanilla command though?
---
That’s it! I couldn’t remember it.
---
A good rogue could still distract to spin you around and then open op on you anyway. ;)
---
I’d be happy with a blizzard world
---
I gave my original account to my nephew,  pre [battle.net](https://pre-battle.net) so I don't even know whether I could access it now
---
You should probably login with your EU Account...
---
Known to your biased mind alone. What I've explained was the history of the launch of Nost. It was an okay server that cashed in on hype, propelling it to the most popular. People will ALWAYS play the most popular server even if there is a better server with a lower population.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You're just trying to justify the time you spent playing there. Nost was not, I say again was not the best vanilla server available or ever made. It was however the biggest.
---
This was so fucking wholesome I smiled in real life. I like you, dude. You're the kind of person I want to play Classic with.
---
There Will also be 20x the population it there can never exist more layers then there are a full server size of players plus one so if 20 layers if resources exist there must exist 19 plus some more players there for the amount of resources will not affect server economy.
---
If I said that feminism is a cult, is that barrens chat?
---
I think he means back pedal as in just walking backwards? Not sure though
---
Not to this sub... who expects a 500 million dollar campaign.
---
Yes there was, and in vanilla also for starting areas..
---
Metzen is awesome!
---
So, you think alienation is a good thing ? Lol. How the stupid consumming and atheist society is destroying people...
---
Perfect.  Thanks both of you.
---
Well you should criticize them, Esfand said he wouldn't say where he would make his guild and urges his fellow guildies not to spoil it either, scumbag move against people who don't want to play on invested servers. best of luck my NA brothers, thank god we only have 1 tard here in EU, unless pewds starts to play, than we are fucked beyond believe
---
Ohh yeah? Whats that i said above that? If you don’t like people asking avoid the thread. People can learn even if they ask here. People have to learn somewhere. But go ahead and tell me they should do it how you think they should.
---
Elitist minmaxers, around the age of 30, living with their moms and using their success in game to create IRL self asteem.
---
Just kidding.  
---
It's just a reference to someone that played on illegal (pirated software) WoW servers.
---
With track humanoid you should never get ganked
---
The real question is if our Troll friends in The Hinterlands quest hub will be up and running at launch. Plenty of Pre-raid BIS items there!
---
Unfortunately there is no way to avoid the annoying streamers at lunch, as many of them have stated they will not announce what server they will be on for the 1st few weeks.
---
You best bet will be not to choose a server until the annoying streamer servers have been discovered (which could take a few hours to a few weeks). You can check here to find out which server they're on https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
It really doesn’t.  It’s great for us who have limited time due to having a demanding job that we can’t take time off for a game and a family. 
---
No way do I want to spend my precious time I have corpse running.
---
Hey man don't give up. You're so good at trolling and griefing c'mon don't you want to practice for Classic?
---
Awhat quest are you referring to???
---
&gt; Naga Stole my Bike.
---
that is just funny though.
---
Hold down that right click and slightly rotate left and right :)
---
Wow. My opinion is worthless yet you want me to keep commenting? 😂😂
---
I play overwatch and when I heard blizzard world was releasing I thought it was an actual real life amusement park.  Turned out it was just  a map for overwatch.
---
Oh you’re in for a TREEEEAAAAATTTT!
---
Because it's gonna be two years until 2.5 set.
---
getting a good night's sleep to start refreshed before ruining your sleep schedule eventually!
---
I don't keep up with them very closely, but yeah that is questionable stuff. That said I'd gamble he will just go to the server that most other big streamers go to anyway.
---
There was some pvp in disney land a few weeks ago.
---
Unless it's extremely layered on launch the best way is always going to be 5 man groups. You can skip the starting zone entirely by grinding lvl 5s then quest in a much larger area while everyone else is still trying to tag scorpions.
---
It's mild for barrens chat, but based on your post history, you likely wouldn't be welcome
---
And what would happen if we give mythic raiders all the tools and abilities that players had in Vanilla? 
---
99% of them probably wouldnt be able to do it.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to prove.  They are different games.
---
A lot of racist redpilling neckbeards play this game man.  This post isn't going to fare well here.
---
Ohh , I don't even have backpeddle bound except on the actual arrow keys
---
The game is practically unrecognizable to me in BFA.  
---
They changed so much crap, and not for the better.
---
Log in early as possible, avoid quests that require you to loot items and group for kill quests. If you get about 5 mins ahead of everyone then you should be good. The only problem I see is for humans at the Fargo deep mine as it is a clusterfuck. Probably similar spots for other zones. But once you hit a level where you can start dungeons it will probably be your best bet up to at least 30.
---
why?
---
At this point I am pretty certain that you're either trolling or being willfully obtuse.  
---
A Naxx geared warlock does not do 400 DPS.
---
Just fyi, most of those annoying streamers said they will not announce what server they're going until a few weeks after launch.
---
Thanks /u/mgd84, /u/-Atlan-, /u/quince666 and /u/uTorrent. I'm feeling very encouraged. My thinking on doing a farm alt was that I will need a farm alt at some stage anyway. So rather than think of it as 'spending' a week to only save a couple days, I would just be changing the order in which I am spending time in order to make my experience a little smoother. 
---
I don't feel I would be wasting time playing an alt I don't like, but I think you're probably all correct that I would have more fun playing my main first and sorting alts later. 
---
Of course it all depends whether my friends want to play alliance or horde. If they make me play alliance, I plan to retaliate by insisting on making a tankadin.
---
'CC' is crowd CONTROL
---
PICKLERICKKKKK
---
Cheers!
---
I mean calling someone a "dumb n*****" when upset with them definitely reveals some low-intelligence privelege at-best, full racism at-worst.
---
&gt; You automatically dismiss private server videos
---
I stopped reading here. You have no idea what you are arguing for if you think PS server have any relevance to vanilla numbers or game mechanics.
---
Please dont brother to respond to me, I will not read any of your replies.
---
The main "problem" with expansions into new lands is that you literally break up the population into "new world" and "old world" with the old world being abandoned. One nice thing with Classic is that both the hardcore raider and the level 20 share the same world and economy.
---
If it was profitable then, its profitable now. Just because it wont have microtransactions and it wont make billions in one year, doesnt mean its not profitable. Either way, the profits wont “meet expectations” for investors.
---
Gee I wonder fucking why, my dude.
---
Also, feel free to compare that feral DPS to rogues. Firstly, I thought ya'll discarded all pserver data since it was fallacious.
---
Secondly, feral does extremely strong DPS while abusing pots, MCP, Wolfshead with powershifting, and it's an entirely moot point because it doesn't matter.
---
The only real downside is sharing your farming spot with the other faction.
---
Ok if I said a Naxx geared warlock does 450 dps, would you agree?
---
Will "Everyone need on BOE epics" still be a thing? If Axe of the Deep Woods drops in a dungeon, for example, and I plan on equipping it, are other people likely to roll greed?
---
Are you serious? The clips were of him calling people a "dumb n***er" .  You think being offended at that makes you a snowflake? You're a snowflake if you get bent out of shape over what offends people
---
You claim that its available on the Internet.  
---
Why dont you prove your statement?
---
Druid, paladin, priest, warrior, warlock, mage, rogue = several. Wow you get an iWin button vs every alliance class just by going undead? Paladin fear sleep or charm how long does that last again?
---
&gt;He said “Thank you, Warrior!” In Thralls freaking voice. 
---
Alright, that's pretty fucking awesome!
---
Haha I love this subreddit
---
I wouldn't call water for all the healers, teleports and AI for "strictly dps", but yes warlock curses alone is gigantic. It's a massive dps increase for mages(and warlocks but that's basically a selfbuff) and the armor reduction is big dps increase.
---
Imagine that, using racial slurs makes you a racist. World's truly upside down.
---
Well....
---
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/inside-joyland-chinas-brazenly-fake-904220
---
That’s true but it’s a small price to pay.  And those who say there’s no world pvp are wrong.
---
Exactly. The "fast pass" is just a "premium" line that lets you skip / merge into the pleb line towards the front, which just pisses people off that didn't pay for it. Instead of experiencing the park in 1-2 days it takes almost an entire week's vacation to ride all the rides, eat at the restaurants, check out all the shops, etc. All the while being shoulder to shoulder around people.
---
Just over here practicing for launch!
---
because your way is petty and foolish.
---
The five fastest Naxx clears:
---
1) Highest warlock is #10 on overall damage.
---
2) Highest warlock is #15 on overall damage.
---
3) Highest warlock is also #15 on overall damage.
---
4) Highest warlock is #9 on overall damage.
---
5) Highest warlock is #5 on overall damage.
---
Oh and if you are curious 4 runs had multiple warriors on top, and one had 1 mage (obviously got some ignite luck) and then some warriors.
---
From these logs it's Warrior &gt; Mage/rogue &gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter
---
Thank you! Currently this is the most controversial topic in classicwow today...
---
You're 100% correct, but this sub has a higher percentage of redpilling badasses than your average sub.  This game attracts a lot of low self-esteem neckbeards, the type to cover that up with far-right political leanings.
---
I just googled that and you're wrong
---
I still remember the passcode to unlock the full version of the first shareware game that I worked to earn enough money for.
---
I still remember my ICQ number.
---
Seems legit to me :)
---

---
Are you the same person who is talking about these the other day in a Nostalgia post?
---
So get one?
---
I know a lot of people that play retail, use/love this UI mod, and I found this today looking for info about it.  If you go deeper in the thread it does not look like it will be ready for the stress test sadly.
---
People enjoy different things
---
Only the weak need leveling guides.
---
I won't really be changing my routine beyond removing other obligations as it is already suited well for binging WoW:

---
You can reserve three characters. Another option that we are doing is reserving one character on three separate Realms. Just to have extra options. It’s not just the streamers you have to worry about, you need to make sure you’re on a healthy server and not lopsided to one faction.
---
just jump into the small keg on the ground and no one will ever notice you
---
Most of the Zones look pretty much the same. But some of them such as darkshore and the Barrens had a lot of changes done. Basically every zone is slightly different but the map layout and some of them is the same. You're almost basically in for a whole new world
---
Raiding 2-3 times a week has no comparison to ranking to 14. R14 might as well be the same as raiding 30 times a week if you compare hours spent.
---
First time ever I played WoW I made a Night Elf Warrior and died to level 5 birds outside the Aldrassil. I didn't know what to do, I saw the coffin icon on the map, but it didn't look like a coffin to me back then, more like double doors. I can't remember if I managed to revive or I gave up and made a new character.  
---
For the record this was my first time playing this thing called "MMORPG".
---
You are incorrect. The main big streamers have already said that they’d say where they’re going.  Not only that, but a lot of them will be streaming the Name Reserve. Plus you’d be able to look it up obviously.
---
Yeah like I said a Warlock is up there with the Mages and Rogues.
---
They will ve found out working minutes tho
---
I actually wont be able to take the week of launch off, but I will be able to take the following week. Which is probably better anyways since it wont be nearly as crowded.
---
It's really hard to go owl on horde though because the only owls in the game are in teldrasil felwood and winterspring
---
Yeah, the "Warcraft" section is rather small it has a bunch of other stolen IPs including Transformers, DC Comics, and Marvel - not exactly what I want - something more like Harry Potter @ Universal Studios would be best.
---
The day I fished for 3 hours and chatted in guild chat.
---
&gt; At 60 it was constantly dispelled, cleansed, and jungle remedied. 
---
How many times was it Jungle Remedy, though?
---
TUki works already.  It's not the same thing but it's pretty close if peeps need something in the mean time.
---
Looks like most of the people who originally messaged me have already found other guilds. At this point there aren't enough to even make a guild. I'm going to just look for an already established guild. Hope you find a new home too.
---
Yeah, but it's completely updated, so comparing it the other ones becomes hard. Everyone knows Joannas was the best guide, Zygor was decent but not a speed leveling guide by any means.
---
The question is if Joannas still is a notch above the new ones, I have a feeling it is, knowing his utter determination and attention to details.
---
Had no idea they  come in more than just those blue glass bottles
---
I know people who lost their jobs or SO due to wow. Never heard anyone losing the kids or house though. In wows defense though these people were generally burn outs / irresponsible and woulda lost their SO or job eventually to some other thing I’m sure.
---
skarm said so
---
Yeh and slows,fears,stuns etc is CC.
---
It will only have a fraction of the capabilities of the retail version because of limitations of Classic. TukUI is already ported to Classic though.
---
Really don't know I really don't care wtf they are doing as long as I can stay clear of them
---
You think anyone is going to be able to sleep with the thoughts of the next day?
---
Oh I know, your comment just reminded me of that story.  It would be super cool to have something like that for real though.  Walking around Stormwind would be pretty neat.
---
My strat is gonna be killin shit all day bay-bay
---
well if they use jungle, then they can't use a health pot, so they don't heal a potential 1750
---
Yeah, except that you categorized your post as 'discussion' and not 'humor'.
---
WotF isn't as big a deal as it was at release.
---
Level three different classes to level 10 in different starting zones. Ser what makes me tick the most
---
I like Questie in theory, but I fear it will just make me tunnel vision on the quest markers instead of the world even when I don't need to look at them. Joana's guide on a second monitor should be more than enough!
---
I'm pretty sure it's you that is going to play with pserver people, not the other way around,
---
It is mostly them that got us classic by committing to it for the last 10 years
---
I saw that, I'll probably wait and see when they think they'll have Elv ready, I can do with out a UI mod for a while for just leveling.
---
Pretty sure he can be solo’d before 60. Definitely easier to do it later. Not that it will be super had 50-55, well at 50 it might.
---
Me: Ah bro, why'd you hit me?  
---
Them: FOR THE HORDE!!
---
What
---
Well, I think the leaks hype the community more than the game itself but the new raid was nice and the zone as well
---
Yes, I will be. A simple questing addon is not game breaking. No matter how many #nochangers jump all over you for it. More people than you think will be using it. Even some of the ones in here saying they won't will break eventually and end up using it too. Do not let people guilt shame you into not using it if you are on the fence.
---
lol, how many layers do you think there are going to be?
---
Thanks! and also for not being a dick about my question :)
---
5GB on my fiber is almost 42 seconds. Unacceptable!
---
I'm probably doing something similar, was planning on taking Friday and having a long weekend for labor day, but I need to set a beach date with the lady friend. Might take a day or two the following week and grind out some levels.
---
I wonder if that would work, I only see my US account when i switch to classic
---
During Wrath of the Lich King there's some problems with my uncle and my aunt. I guess you was playing the game more than she wanted and not giving her attention. They divorced a few years later. The recently heard at this same aunt and her daughter my cousin had a falling out. My own mother also doesn't talk to this aunt so maybe it's not Wow's fault but they got divorced.
---
Whats a Bawls and why should we get them for classic?
---
Which part confused you?
---
I can definitely see that. Well I hope you're all adjusted to it as that specific gene is a quite recent discovery afaik and super rare
---
more time awake but less time to heal sounds about right
---
Yes lvl 60, but I believe they got rid of them when cataclysm was released
---
What do you mean? Now we can play the game.
---
the fuck.
---
Eh skinning is the easiest of the gathering to level  and doesn’t require too much running around. Sure you can plvl lw pretty easy if you’re flush but leveling skinning again would require you spend no cash and allows you to keep your lw for your cured rugged hide xmute as an easy gold income in the meantime.
---
No one is as perfect as you I suppose.
---
I'm stocking up on Bangs and XYcience energy drinks. Also making 50lb of beef jerky for the leveling grind.
---
Except most black people are fighting for the complete opposite of what you just said. I respect your opinion, but non-black people thinking like you do, is the exact reason why many anti-racist people are losing their shit. A huge majority don't care about the intent, but the word/phrase itself is the problem, because it refers to a stereotype they don't want to be associated with, or a word which was used as a condescending  many years ago.
---
Where can I download addons that are classic ready?
---
Remember when a warlock was really usfull in your group for these types of issue's
---
Laptops fucking suck
---
Haha cheers, hope to see you in game sir!
---
Idk what you mean, i thought classic = vanilla? I have already tested it on Lightshope and it works perfectly!
---
Tell him rare drops include dwarf boobie pics. LOL
---
If we get no queues, that's positive.
---
If we get queues, that's positive.
---
Everything's positive when WoW classic comes about. Positive vibes only and we're all going places.
---
&gt; I won't really be changing my routine beyond removing other obligations as it is already suited well for binging WoW
---
So no, this is not something I'm doing just for a video game. This is something I've been doing since finishing undergrad ~6 years ago, though the routine gets almost completely destroyed whenever I travel.
---
My plan:
---
Step 1. Wait 3 days
---
Step 2: Play
---
i will literally only drink gfuel and soda and wont stretch my legs or do anything stupid like that.
---
stop acting like people will die if they dont.
---
Careful, that other dude is probably a supervisor and now he’s gonna try to get you canned on some trumped up charges involving guest privacy.
---
To get rank 14 you needed to play 12+ hours a day 7 days a week. (12 is the lower end particularly if you’re making the jump from R13-R14) You also needed to maximize honor gain so you needed to do your best to win. Whether that means carrying games hard solo or creating a list of active pvpers to help you along the way. On bonus honor weekends you basically needed to shoot for 16-20 hours. 
---
It was a significant time investment and unless you were on a low pop server you basically had to skirt all other responsibilities in favor of grinding honor.
---
What if I have no games at all?
---
No one:
---
Joana: ok so solo this named +4 level mob
---
Well, it’s 50 Arcanite and a buttload of raid drops to craft it. It’s not cheap, but a far cry from 15k. Thunderfury is far more expensive to craft.
---
ye, im the same, lucky for me i play pve servers
---
You honestly think Arthas is anywhere remotely close to the recognizably of Mario?
---
Nah.
---
How much of this is for real life vs your desire to binge WoW for two-three weeks?
---
I don't get why you would want that. You will cast spell on target with low priority and be on universal cooldown for important abilities.
---
It very easy to say the raids are alright when you have no other examples to base it off of, the raids are pretty fucking bad compared to recent expansions.
---
Are you... literate? Like, at all? Your first sentence is batantly incorrect and the rest is **exactly** what my post explained, but restated in a dickish way.
---
Certainly uses foul language. Probably just doing it for a ride out of people tho? Like you said he can't be banned on those servers. If he continues the behavior he will be banned on live. I see no problem honestly..... If someone on voice chat in my raid would drop n-bombs he would be asked to stop, and if not subsequently banned if the behavior continued. 
---
I think you are making this out to be a bigger problem than it is.... This is no way reflects on staysafe....
---
People say bad words. This is america, get used to it. Don't associate with them, and report them when possible. 
---
And grow some thicker skin. No one forces you to engage with this guy. Report exists for a reason. Ignore exists for a reason....
---
Your in for a disappointment if you think your playing a different game.
---
Never rerolled. From Vanilla to present, my main was always the same. None of my alts is at max level.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my realm in the great pvp wars of red ridge and Arathi HIghlands, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on horde AND aliance, and I have over 300,000,000 confirmed kills. I am trained in open world warfare and I'm the top teabagger in the entire US-EAST nerd forces. You are nothing to me but just another red is dead. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of rogues across azeroth and your hearth is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your main. You're fucking ganked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my unarmed skill. Not only am I extensively trained my unarmed wepon skill, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps guild and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy ret-paladin your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking ganked, kiddo.
---
(rewriting this meme took me way too much effort when i should have been working)
---
My classes start on the 19th.  However, I made them all online classes so that I can pretty much do them at my own pace.  I will be working my ass off in the week before launch to get 3+ weeks ahead of schedule in all my classes, and playing every day uninterrupted until the head start I've given myself wears off or the first round of exams hits.
---
Ive actually bought a crt for classic am I going crazy ?

I used to use my hunter pet being ally and sneak into cross roads and kill horde with pet lol

easy to remember and type and you can make them as long and complex as you want/is allowed
---
All of it besides sending my SO on vacation (normally I'd go too, but we just got back from another and she knows I'm hyped up for Classic).
---
If i remember correctly swiftmend is wotlk tho
---
I'll probably log in at launch, do some exploration to grab FP and XP, then take some time off to grind after about a week when stability issues are settled
---
Tarren mill and somewhat crossroads.
---
Stonetalon is underrated though, lots of good hiding places same as redridge and the lowest contested zone.
---
Well, there were Pandaren in Warcraft 3 as well as Chen's Keg in Vanilla WoW so we have knowledge of at least one, but over the years the Warcraft RPG developed an alternate concept of the Pandaren in which the benevolent and peaceful Monks and Brewmasters were a small part of Pandaren society. This left open the potential for "bad" Pandaren, but all that lore was wiped away with Mists, in which they are basically Tauren with slightly different deities.
---
Thank you, that looks interesting. 
---
In the meantime I got this https://www.amazon.de/Zelotes-programmierbare-Einstellbare-Backlight-Schwarz/dp/B01LYOMBC0/ref=mp_s_a_1_12?keywords=wow+mouse&amp;qid=1564944814&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-12

We'll see if it's as good as is seems to be.
---
Heheh, I knew you had the good stuff!
---
To play. Without trying to throw myself at end game content.

Who are you to judge? Im Just saying theres ALSO some pretty healthy stuff in there. And he thought things through and plans and structures a coming period of his life. He inspires me to think my routines through. Which I am already working on for some time now. Its better then being an loose cannon kinda Guy creating chaos everywhere you go. Theres already enough chaos in the World.
---
Which is better, xperl or Luna unit frames?  I've never used either.
---
Ah explains it

people play different than you my dude

You need to have a EU account to play en a EU server.

better than your uncle

Is it BigDebuffs?

Warlocks will always be good because they have infinite mana. Extra health from imp, health stones and ele/shadow curses will always be needed.

Hi, im trying to extract some data from wowhead or classic db to make a chart, how can i do that easily (without scraping it)?
---
I e tested *on pservers* Joana on horde against some others and while I liked the route it's paced for a hunter or warlock. Even as a rogue with some twink gear (zealot blade+fiery at 29 etc) it was pretty difficult because sometimes he asks you to fight +2-4 level mobs.
---
I have my eyes on CauthonLuck as although it's just starter zone content so far it's been excellent

Is the list of realms coming out this week in anticipation of the character creation next week?

There are quests that give bags
---
All classes can do it in well under 2 hours, shamans and mages are the fastest and can do it in 1:20ish, Monkeynews once leveled a warrior to 11 including professions in 2hours, and warrior is probably the slowest 1-10
---
Its 1.12 client
---
It saves you 20s but that’s a lot of time you could spend just levelling your main and getting probably a lot more money from questing. Pretty sure the most efficient thing to do is just barrel along a good questing path ignoring all profs but FA and censoring everything in an effort to get to 60 as soon as possible but I mean efficiency isn’t everything. Play as you want but I doubt spending time levelling an alt is more efficient. Probably getting a bank alt into position saves time in the long run though.
---
you want bad things to happen to people because....they use add-ons?? 
---
lol that's so toxic
---
How will feral druids be affected with dungeon lockouts? If they are limited in the number of pummelers they can farm are they (significantly) less effective that some guides based off private servers would suggest?
---
You got downvoted but I mostly agree especially with the Cataclysm class upheavals.
---
I appreciated getting a signature ability at level 10 when you chose a tree but turning every class into a point builder/spender for no damned good reason was a big turn off.
---
If you don’t care about leveling efficiency and don’t mind being behind/ in the zerg then do whatever you want.

Tedious but not hard. Most of anything worth it in classic is tedious to get
---
It's only game. Why you heff to be mad?
---
Next stress test is on Thursday, I'll record a video and show you.
---
I tested this thoroughly and even asked on the official forums, they too told me that instant cast spells are supposed to push back your swing timer.
---
Later there are,  But you will likely be buying 6 slot bags from the vendor or another player you come across.
---
like i said i'd want it to have a priority to what it decides to cast on. so if i'm already targetting an enemy, or mousing over an enemy, it would cast on them and not tab to a low priority target. 
---
and if you're in a situation where you're there aren't any low priority targets around, you're alone but you expect a stealthed rogue is nearby, it would make it quicker to get a cast off them as soon as they become visible from stealth.
---
"and be on universal cooldown for important abilities." not sure what you mean by this.
---
I heard that locks started as horrible in Vanilla and they were slowly buffed with each patch. By 1.12 they were strong, but due to difficulty of leveling and gearing in Vanilla few people played warlocks (because they were bad in all previous patches...) so guilds just didn't have many locks to their disposal. Not that it mattered, as mages, rogues and warriors did their job just fine.
---
As to why there were no locks on top of matters - maybe their gear was bad? Like all clothes was being funneled to mages? I don't know. But the rotation is literally spam Shadowbolt. The damage values of it were known and accurate on pservers. Where would the difference come from?
---
Druid doesn’t suck in pvp. Druid healers are a nuisance, particularly against alliance as they lack shamans crazy offensive dispels. They’re incredibly mobile and difficult to kill. Feral druids don’t just make excellent flag carriers, they’re capable of laying down heals and disrupting with potent short cd interrupts and stuns. With roots, faerie fire, their buff and everything else in their ridiculous toolkit a Druid is an excellent accompaniment to a bg, a ganking squad or as part of any large siege or battle.
---
Druids are not who you would want to be in a duel however in world pvp and 1v1s they can either win a war of attrition or simply run away, with great success. 
---
Druids do not suck. They just won’t be making a lot of kills by themselves. They are a support class and they support very well.
---
Each layer is going to have approximately as many players as an entire vanilla server did as per the recent euro interview. Way more people per layer than the beta. It’s going to be packed.
---
assuming 2 tanks 7 healers that leaves 31 spots for dps.  8 classes per faction is 3.875 spots per class.  remove druids, pala/shaman and you have 5.17 slots per class.  Not sure why you are pushing so hard on oNlY ThReE WaRloCKs because that falls right in line with even distribution.  Also, not everyone will be in a Nihilum level guild so your point is moot.
---
tl;dr
---
if you aren't braindead you will get a raid spot regardless of class.  getting 40 people online at the same time is hard.
---
I made a mistake by not giving attention to the first sentence, thought this was solely for binge playing WoW.
---
Because hunters level and earn gold way more efficiently than rogues, yupp. I'm leveling the hunter to 60 and will raid/farm on him while I use his gold making abilities to gear the rogue up as he levels.
---
Coke is not junk food?
---
Who let that gnome on the boat?
---
Ohh yeah you’ve been on every server in retail? You did a poll? Or did you pull that out of your ass?
---
Guys
---
Enjoy the game. From a vanilla player. The rush wasnt what made it fun. Please take time to enjoy the game
---
And they do everything other than flag carrying worse than other classes. Its why you bring 1 for WSG premades and none for Av or Ab
---
The casting animation for offensive spells as a male troll is KAMEKAMEHAAAAAAA
---
At launch probably not that much if you don't want to. Since mob tagging isn't shared unless you're in a party most people will be super willing to party up to do a quest or a few.
---
If you mouseover a random player and cast automatically an ability, you will be on the universal cooldown when the rogue pop. You will be dead. It's not efficient and a recipe for disaster.
---
Get over it. Instead of 1337 speak we have twitch emotes now.
---
Beta cap was raised to 40 before it ended by the way. But yeah this is still pserver footage because there's no report bug button visible.
---
You misspelled Paladin t2
---
On the boat you can actually hide behind the barrels under the stairs as a gnome.  A nice gnome taught me this.
---
Pretty sure you can use conditional programming in macros to solve that problem, you can use a modifier like alt or shift but you need to make the decision on how you want to target.

Lol good luck aoe farming at the farms in Hillsbrad Foothills. You will be ganked mercilessly, and there will be loads of competition from other Horde players.
---
Rolling a priest main. Take tailoring/herb and drop tailoring after making gear at 60 for alch or go tailoring/enchanting and drop tailoring for something else at 60?
---
Alt will have skinning/mining (hunter).
---
Full UBRS attunement run! LFM.
---
Half the raid quits after Rend.
---
Cool I didn't knew that. Guess I grew tired of classic streams pretty quickly.
---
It can pull 1k dps in 1.12...that's respectable for any class.
---
I'm pretty sure there's more money in console and pc gaming than ever despite the fact that mobile is huge.
---
The only thing I would say is a lot of guides may be slower from 1-10 but could be faster for 1-15 or 1-20 etc.
---
For example some human guides don't leave elwynn/westfall until level 12 or so, while judgments guide leaves at 8-9 to go to dunmorogh, loch Modan, and darkshore sooner which are rich in xp, but that travel time could skew results for a 1-10 test.
---
MC locks crit for a lot more than 1100-1200. Rank 9 SB base damage is like 480 average, so a naked lock with no talents or gear or debuffs crits for 960. Throw in CoS, a shadow priest, DS or SM, and then pre raid bis and some consumes and it’s not hard to get crits for 1500+ in MC.
---
People don't necessarily enjoy car crashes, but will watch them anyways.

I'm certain a list will be compiled by someone of the top streamers, so we can play with, them or avoid them, whichever the preference.

What'd you dislike about it? The leaving to dun morogh at 8?
---
you're a legend thanks a ton.
---
Maybe that’s what you meant but the way you worded it made us all sound like racists. How would you even know I’m on a pserver if i never told you? You basically lumped is all together. It doesn’t matter that you didn’t mean all of us. You put the negative light on us just by saying it the way you did. Personally, I want as many pserver players to n my guild as possible.

You can’t control what people say. You can only control how you feel about it. They only have power if you let them. It also doesn’t help when people use racial slurs as terms of endearment.

It's not like there's a ton of content at 60.  No bg and the dungeons at geared toward level 50-55. New players who actually try to speed level will be so disappointed.

tl;dr - WF procs on a 2H weapon are gloriously fun but may not be optimal dps.

your computer could be a potato by todays standards and run wow classic.

Ok. Should have been clear. No one is "in harm's way," because they choose to group up with somebody that uses racist speech.

On my last playthrough, I had ~40 silver at level 10. Two hours later, I had an additional gold.

What's better? 1.5 gold (1.3 after buying 4 bags) or 40s twice?

All the expansion is fluff, aside from the harbour and AH which are the only changes of significance. The setup and layout and location of all things in BFA Stormwind is identical to what it was in Classic.

early game no but some extra gold for best food and repair. at level 45 and above you begin to making gold
---
Azshara is horrible post-cata by comparison.
---
ah i see, yeah that's a good point. i hadn't considered mouse turning but that would make it a bit trickier. i guess i'll see when i test it out if it's worth it or if it would be better to use a function key for mouseover.

I have a demanding job, not much time, but I'm sick of playing on PvE servers with a half-assed experience where when I meet Hordes I /wave at them and they /wave back at me... We are at war FFS...  
---
I know ganking sucks, I've been ganked a lot more than I've ganked others, hence why I spent a lot of time on private servers in PvE realms to avoid the stress, but at one point, the experience starts to feel empty and incomplete. I'm also a bit tempted to play on a PvE server, but I've decided to go PvP and experience both the good and the bad as it is meant to be.
---
You do not. NS is the 21 point Resto talent, Swiftmend is the 31 point resto talent.
---
No, you see more of them because of the lack of moderation.
---
Remove moderation from retail and you'll be dealing with the same shitshow
---
These same racists you speak of wont be acting like this in classic/retail because they know it will get them banned, but it doesn't make them any less racist.
---
Not judging on your decisions, but you should be thankful for the so called "pirate players" for making pserver popularity start a wave of demand for Blizz to make Classic.
---
I don't get PvE servers, it's like a safe space and it's just plain wrong.
---
Retail bad Classic good gimme gold
---
There’s really no reason to ever even use it.  The mana cost will never justify the extra 50ish damage or whatever it is.
---
Each layer is going to hold what, 3000 people? How many friends do you need?
---
True. I still run to where the AH door used to be only to be confronted by a wall
---
Hell no.
---
I made 5 chars to 60 in launch classic (alliance) and 2 more chars during TBC.
---
Also 1 Horde in private servers.. so no need for helpers really.
---
I think people are underestimating how easy it is to find out classic exists. It’s on Reddit, every fan and gaming news site. If you are interested in MMOs you can’t miss all the classic news coverage for the past year.
---
Did blizzard have tv commercials and billboards for BFA? Legion? I don’t remember any.
---
I was looking for this as well. I downloaded most add-ons I liked that are compatible for classic and I plan to test them during the stress test Thursday. if anyone has a better way I'm listening.
---
One of the changes in the patches is the change to bosses negative resistance.
---
In bwl locks started getting strong as they got more gear so people always say locks start getting good from bwl.
---
But post bwl was the change to resistance, which was a big nerf to lock and their scaling overall. If that change didn’t exist locks would be very strong in naxx with the additional gear. 
---
But that change kind of caused their dps gain from gear to slow down. The scaling factor was lower once bosses resistance couldn’t go negative.
---
3001
---
I'm going to level without a level add-on. But I will use it once I hit level 60 to find low level quests. My main in Vanilla had every available quest (except quest related to raids) done. And I'm going to do it again in classic.

I don’t like you

It won’t work, some of the BiS items are like level 45 items till aq40

Some form of addon that shares your talents and gear through chat will exist - a long range inspect if you will, but I don't know that there's really any benefit to assigning a numeric value to them. It would be entirely subjective and different for each class.

My snacks and drinks are pretty straight forward: Boba tea/coffee, sugary energy drinks from 7-11, coffee, oven pizzas (x3), Costco chicken bakes (x2), homemade french toast, Jimmy Deans breakfasts sandwich box (x2), tendies, BBQ chips, and various fruits&amp;veggies throughout the day. I got big mall and an In-N-Out even closer so all types of fast food is covered as well as any kind of take out you could want to the point having it delivered is a waste. 
---
I got a list of classic 70s-80s and some 90s action films that's become pretty extensive. I'm going to start working on some music playlists, a couple of podcasts I've skipped or missed. I got 3 monitors plus my tablet should I need it so I got guides, entertainment and communications covered. I don't except my buddy to keep up with my much unless he suddenly shows more interest but he's sort of a less reliable to play with so I'll depend more on the guild we are starting.
---
My biggest word of advice is moderation and keeping a schedule. A schedule will really help make your game time more productive, going ahead and accepting the fact you maybe having a few 16+ hour sessions back to back and break it down into chunks and fit in some 30-45 minute breaks in there and actually get up and do things. Stretch, water the plants, walk your dogs/cat/lizard/fish. Don't just sit there and watch youtube videos or use the bathroom and come back. 
---
I myself will be doing 20-30 minute workouts with the kettlebell and pull up bar and then go for a 20-30 minute run in the neighborhood and finish it up with a shower and meal before game time... This pretty much keeps my body maintained, allows me to eat some bad food and burn it off pretty easy, and still able to do ridiculously long stretches of game time while going to school full time and working odd jobs.
---
That cannot possibly be a better alternative than just farming a few extra mobs either for cloth or vendor trash...
---
All of them! I don’t want layering at all. I want 3-5k populations from the start.
---
There was only 1 good thing about the isle.
---
It made finding people on my own faction that I despised easy.  I knew a ton of alliance priests in vent since guilds used the same ones. 
---

---
My character and guild were not popular with a lot of people on the server
---
Slows are snares fears and stuns are CC
---
You could make an addon that just takes the 15 best items for any class / spec per phase, just give those a number from 1 to 15 and value ppl on that. If they don't have one of those top 15, just give them zero points. Shouldn't be too hard from an addon.
---
Should be easy to implement even.
---
One of the comments I was responding to explicitly mentioned exorcism as a source of dps for ret, so I was including it for the sake of a thorough response.
---
But hey, keep being a pedantic needle dick and I’m sure people will fall all over themselves agreeing with you.
---
Reeeeee
---
Same!
---
i calculated it its not worth to invest time in twinks. its bether to train the main hero. 
---
people remember names but not of twinks. 
---
i will only play one char for this reason.
---
It does not matter what you explain, it is known by actual players to be a failure in practice because no dual spec. 
---
You can talk long and hard all you like, and believe me when I say I wish classics role/spec diversity wasn’t trash, but it is. 
---
Pld as heals and buffs are literal gods, as compared to their well below average tanking and dps ability. 
---
So there is really only a few possibilities here: our expectations when running dungeons are completely different or your experience with actually running dungeons is low to nonexistent.
---
He’s talking about classic beta, not vanilla wow or private servers. Shit from the last 15 years doesn’t matter if it’s not working that way anymore.
---
No xp in bgs.
---
Thanks for collecting some hard data on various guides and actually tested on Classic beta. Need moar of this!
---
Sounds like Joana's Alliance guide isn't bad? I know his Horde guide was legend, but his Alliance guide seemed to be an afterthought.
---
I do this more than I care to admit.

Yes easily. Most BIS list have items ranked from best to worst for each slot. Just assign each item a score inverse to their rank, and sum over each item slot. Gearscore. 
---
Do I want to...no
---

Except for the realms that were down for a few days.
---
Most people don’t normally have issues with Xpack launches. That doesn’t mean everyone gets clear though. I’ve been lucky and haven’t run into them at all, friend however was locked out for a few hours due to login server issues.   And obviously the down realms just didn’t play at all.
---
You get your shields eaten and have no way of damaging the lock besides instant casts. He'll run you oom till you have to drink, and now you're fighting with half mana.
---
We also have carrots which you can dip in cottage cheese or any other dips you fancy. Enjoy Classic!
---
&gt;I get that. Just because people say they can’t doesnt mean other people care. Especially, when people of a specific race use the one word they hate as a term of endearment. 
---
I'm not going to go into politics and if white people can say it, just because black people say it to their other black friends. Point is, a huge majority don't want white or about any other race than what's considered black, to use it, with/without intent. 
---
&gt; In fact I’d guess racists love it when people get offended by them. It  fuels them. I’m from the southern us. I’ve seen some racist assholes in  my day. Reacting to them only gives them power. If it’s just words it  can’t really hurt you unless you have really thin skin. Wear it like  armor. Then they can’t use it to hurt you anymore.
---
Racism, just like about any other form of social bullying have been proven to be a problem if ignored. I get your point about reacting to racism, and that's the shit parents used to tell their kids in school during the 90s when their kid got bullied "Don't react to their actions, it'll fuel them and make them continue" - While it might have worked somewhat, speaking up against it and setting an example of stuff like that not being acceptable have proven far better. Studies literally show that.
---
Ahh... the old GS thing, that ruined WotLK
---
Got a solution... well meaby, name your character like big streamers “asmongold”, “estefan”, “staysafe”... etc . If you can’t create that character, they may be there, or meaby if you beat them to it, the streamers will jump to another server. So it worth sacrificing one of three name reservations if there one particular streamer you want to avoid.
---
Yeah, I don't see why I wouldn't. I'd just end up using wowhead anyway if I didn't.
---
kill it with fire....
---
Do-do, do do do.
---
The stress tests weren't set up to run well, they were throttled down to see how well they handled overload given X number of players. I don't know if launch will be rough or smooth but but I don't think we have any way of knowing based on what we've seen.
---
Otherwise, just so long as I can log in I can do lots of stuff to be productive which could save me time later. Here's my priorities:
---
\- First: I'll roll lvl 1 bank and farming alts and get them in place no matter what. Just makes sense to have that stuff set up right away.
---
\- If possible, I'll level my main (dwarf) with quests and grinding, hoping to hit 10 to 13 in my first big push. I'm guessing there will be a lot of groups forming right at lvl 1 for efficiency.
---
\- I can always check the Night Elf starting zone where my alt will start to see if it's any better than the dwarf zone.
---
\- If questing is too rough but I can get my dwarf to lvl 5 I'll train professions and start fishing in cities so I can earn rest while leveling fishing / cooking. I could also do herb runs if the servers are running OK but it's just too crowded to tag mobs / complete quests.
---
\- If the starting zones are impossible, I'll be productive by getting a few key flight paths via corpse running. My maincan take the shortcut over the IF hills to Menethil so I have fast access to Darkshore, and also take the tram to SW so I can corpse run to Darkshire, Sentinel Hill, and booty bay which opens up the Barrens / Rachet and can buy the expert fishing book once I grind up a gold. I can also run to Loch Modan for the FP and for fishing after I'm high enough.
---
Go back to retail
---
Some people enjoy min maxing and being efficient as possible
---
Not an expert here, but in "World of Roguecraft 2" they show this from both sides.
---
Which means it will be made, it will be used and sooner or later everyone will use it. Just like now, can't find a group without IO rating.
---
&gt;arms until 40 then into fury?
---
If anything it's the opposite, or just arms the whole time
---
I've quit 4 characters at 52-55
---
Eventually came back and leveled them all,  but that's always where I burn out
---
most of the classic addons works in retail so if you're subbed you could get most of em set up there.
---
ive done it. 
---
mostly quest addons and "background" addons that doesnt work in retail, bars, frames etc works.
---
Keep your Retail spirit out of my Classic game. You're a bad person if you want this.
---
I plan to main warrior, with ranking not being in at launch I'm considering leveling my main-alt Mage first on a second account. I'd be able to get to 60 much faster, and start in on that early game gold farming (devilsaur, black lotus, etc) while the getting is good. Then I'd be able to give my Warrior a much easier time leveling (coming to one shot WW axe boss for example) and help funnel some gold his way too. I do plan to raid with both once whatever guild I'm in starts doing second runs of each raid as well. I can't decide though haha.
---
I remember my SSN &amp; phone number... does that count? *shrugs*
---
thats not really accurate.  length makes passwords exponentially harder to bruteforce and the shortest and weakest password I used as an example is 14 characters with a cap and a number.  It's a solid password.
---
Canwefit3bodiesinthetrunk? is uncrackable god password
---
I’m pretty sure it wasn’t about mind control
---
Gearscore wont work in classic since item level does not directly translate to score.
---
I agree, but a white supremacist?
---
&gt; You could
---
You could too
---
yeah but then again in classic it might be different thanks to the sub barrier the people might be less dogshit and also the servers aren't going to be bloated with overpopulation with 10k+ and shit but I could be wrong so I'm not sure yet
---
but yeah I'm inclining towards pve
---
There was a guild on my BC server named “Nine inches unbuffed”
---
Wait 3 days before playing.
---
Will i be able to get add-ons for classic trough the twitch client like in retail?
---
I remember watching all the pvp videos from the OG beta and was torn between Orc Hunter or Undead Priest.  Got to the character select screen and went with the Hunter, was one of the first server 60s, got to MC where everyone couldn't kill the first 2 Giants and nobody wanted hunters in the raids.
---
Said fuck this rerolled Priest and never played the Hunter again lol
---
How’s those studies hold up to people being racist online?
---
I'm glad I never played WoW or any MMO for that matter with Gear score...
---
Better yet, an addon that shows how many instance runs people have completed in what time and what role. They can call it [Classic.IO](https://Classic.IO) or something like that. 
---
It will improve the classic experience immensely along with some questing addons.
---
P.S GO BACK TO RETAI, TY.
---
OP: "Lol ur gear score is 17"
---
/gkick OP
---
Too busy working on my dungeon finder addon
---
I would argue mine is better, but ofc I am biased and since Joana's 40-60 isnt public I can't compare.
---
I mean that I wont durdle around levelling fishing and 3-5 alts at the same time while totally immersing myself in the lore and music. 
---
I’ll lvl to 60 as fast as I can so I can start playing the game.

 **Ascension  |  Alliance-PvP-Central  |  CasualCore**  
---
**About Us** :  I've never been a fan of long winded posts.  I was the GM / RL of our vanilla guild.  We were the best or vying for the best on our server.  We no lifed it then.  5 hour raids, 5 days a week.  There isn't a need for that now and as such we are taking a more laid back approach.  Most of us have families and careers.  We will get shit done without losing our jobs or wives/husbands while doing it.  Our core group of 16 all played vanilla together.  We are a down to earth, laid back, awesome group of folks.    
---
**Raid Times** : Tue/Thu/Mon 7-1030pm CST.  Mondays will only be used when needed.  This probably won't happen til AQ/Naxx.    
---
**Loot System** : Class based Loot Council.  Extremely fair, unbiased system.  No one will get back to back pieces unless its a tank and if someone that isn't a tank is getting back to back loot its due to no one else needing said loot.  We run item restrictions as well.  No huntard rolling on tfury for example.    
---
**Rules** : Our rules are short and simple.  Don't make us look bad, dont be an ass.  Help your guildies (dont get a drop and charge them for it).  No drama.  Drama = instant boot.  Must be active in discord from now going forward.    
---
**Current Roster** : 40 (6 casual)    
---
Druid : 4   
---
Hunter : 4   
---
Mage : 6 (3 casual)   
---
Paladin : 4   
---
Priest : 6   
---
Rogue : 5 (1 casual)   
---
Warlock : 5   
---
Warrior : 6 (3 Tank, 1 Fury) (2 casual tanks)    
---
**Needs** :  People that can make our raid times for sure, 100%    
---
Tank Warrior : 1    
---
Fury Warrior : 3-4    
---
Shadow Priest : 1-2    
---
Ret Pally : 1   
---
Feral Druid : 1 (must have LotP)   
---
Rogue : 1   
---
Mage 2-3   
---
 If you think you would be a nice fit, hit me up in our discord : [https://discord.gg/XYjhC9W](https://discord.gg/XYjhC9W)
---
I'm a bit lost on how your comment is relevant to what I said.
---
"Valor helm dropped, how could I roll a 6?
---
Gratz to my guildmate, but I can't believe this shit!"
---
-World of Warcraft is a feeling!
---
It was in beta, so probly!
---
You should do druid/rogue instead. Stealth wpvp, stealth bosses in instances, and if you do get camped you can both res and stealth away.
---
If we can combine this with an addon that just auto detects someone who underperforms and instakicks those ppl then we can atleast play retail in classic.
---
The possibilities people.
---
0-60 in 3 hours with adderall
---
No they aren t. I don t want to face preamdes thanks.
---
No, a sub-60 paladin will never be able to AoE-farm more effectively than killing mobs one by one.
---
A properly geared level 60 prot paladin will be able to farm the level 51-53 skeletons in western plaguelands and that's about it. A sub-standard way of earning gold compared to doing Dire Maul: East jump-runs as holy.
---
All the guides I tested were 1-10 in dun morogh, so that issue didn't really come up. But, yea what you're saying makes sense. Like an exploration route I made will get you to level 10 in 3.5hrs, but you get westfall, loch modan, redridge, darkshire, sw, IF, wetlands, auberdine, teldrassil, etc... flightpaths. Which are prettttty handy to have and will save time later.
---
I'll take a look at judgements though, never heard of it.
---
He's carbo loading.
---
And they will be a thing until phase 3 rolls around when WSG and AV roll around
---
Way more than 90% of the population is familiar with Mario.
---
Go ask Grandma who Arthas is. Now go ask here who Mario is.
---
Yeah... log in to the starter edition of wow...
---
That...actually explains horde rogue population pretty well, assuming things were different on alliance. Seemed like the only way to get a group as rogue was to start it.
---
They might roll greed if they’re guildies or are ignorant of the AH value of the item or just don’t notice that it’s BOE. 
---
But as rough as it sounds, everyone rolling need is the most fair since it can benefit everyone (by selling ).
---
, blessed blade of the windseeker?
---
How is being the second worst dps "competitive"?
---
Haha, thanks! Yeah his alliance guide is pretty nice. He does good work.
---
They obviously don't hold up the same way, because the scenario is different. You talked about growing up in Southern US though, so I figured you were talking about IRL situations as well. But the point still stands on racism and the general consensus of what's okay to say/write. Racism over a video-game is still racism with/without good intentions.
---
People are usually still not fine with the N word.
---
Is this literally exploring all the way to level 10? I've only seen it to level 4-6 usually to skip the starting zone and go right to the second zone ahead of the rush lol
---
It's a little bit too complex solution for a rather easy problem. 
---
Just ask people to link 3 best gear pieces they have. This tells enough to know with who you're dealing with.
---
Aka the guide that only works if layering allows it...
---
&gt;beta when there were still a ton of people leveling, 
---
care to elaborate? I'd appreciate constructed feedback
---
It's his guild.... He can say whatever he wants on his voice chat..... Don't listen to his voice chat or join his guild 😂
---
Go ask people in Euganda if they know who Mario is. No a majority of the world do not know who they are.
---
Look up Kargoz warrior guide on youtube. Pretty informative video, i honestly just go arms the entire time. Saves respec cost, plus it's decent to level with. You're not going to see a really huge crazy difference if you go fury from 1-40.  I'm not entirely sure how the whole /sit blood craze+enrage is working on the beta, that's one of the upsides to fury if it's working correctly.
---
I am sure it will happen but I won't be using it.
---
It's 1.1g vs 0.8g.   But he is an alt, and his 2nd toon is leveling faster, because it doesn't have to manage it's bag space nearly as much.   
---
Mulgore is particularly bad for inventory space, because the 2nd village gives you about 5 gather quests at the same time.  There's like 10 different quest items taking up bag space.
---
My strategy heavily depends on how crowded the Night Elf starting zone is and whether or not layering works.
---
Yeah but with paladin when someone pops will of the forsaken they can eat a full hammer of justice stun that lasts the entire duration.  Priest / locks share dr on fear, and paladins can stoneform off blind and use sac to break sheep/freeze. There is a lot more they can do too.
---
Thex lives in us all
---
Way over thinking it lol... play the game and get the shit while leveling.
---
Not a bad strategy.  Are you alliance or horde?  Care to give some examples of where you were supposed to level and where you actually leveled?
---
That’s the one thing I now know. I’ll be only war in most instances and or be up front about items I want. Being open and honest goes a long way. In relationships and WoW!
---
Very wrong
---
In the stress tests, they respawned instantly I am pretty sure
---
And yes he uses despicable language. Not trying to defend the guy.  
---
I just don't think this post in necessary... If you don't want to hear this guys venting on discord.... Don't....
---
Even better!
---
Thanks
---
Don't feed the troll!
---
Racism is looking down on someone for their skin color and thinking you are superior, it's not your narrow as fuck definition. Must be nice lacking empathy to the point that you can ignore people looking down on others for the color of their skin just because it doesn't fit into what you think it is.
---
Chuck Norris jokes weren't making fun of Chuck Norris. Racist jokes punch down and reinforce the stereotypes associated with systematic racism. It's not 'just words' when a Jewish person hears others making jokes about the genocide of their people. It's not 'just words' when a black person hears over and over again a racial slur dating back to a time when their people were *slaves*. It's *just words* to you because you obviously lack the ability to care about how what words you use might hurt other people.
---
We can agree that yeah, you're a shitty person perfectly okay with allowing others to be harmed because they're just *words* to your entitled ass.
---
Layering...
---
You don't understand what the guy is saying.  Linking an xkcd as your entire argument doesn't do well for your argument.

The you feel better/a difference after the IV or something? Or is it just a way to pump yourself with what you need easily?
---
No, we need Blizzard World
---
MC can be done with greens but yeah your right. This game is all about grinding. I sometimes compare Vanilla to Runespace humorously.
---
I am going Alliance.  Great ^^
---
Shows you how often I go to the wow websites or keep up with that.  I forgot that they removed it technically, but you can still search for people.  For example.

---
The rest still holds true though.  You can bet your ass that there will be dozens and dozens of guilds that roll characters on every server just to find the streamers,  Do you really think Asmon and Esfand are going to name their characters anything else?  Or Soda?  Their names will be found out within minutes what server they are on.  There arent going to be 50 servers.  More than likely it will be a lot lower.  Saying it will take weeks to find out is a fucking joke.
---
Launch is tuesday ill play a little that night go to work wednesday then im taking off thurs and fri and monday is a holiday. I figure tuesday and wednesday day will be left alone incase there are server issies but wednesday night through monday im gunna lan with my buddy like we are kids again. Wife was put on notice a month ago.
---
I leveled on multiple servers at the start and besides the starting area 1-5 I never had that much difficulties for mobs, Often when you ended up waiting for that special monster you just party up and be done with it.
---
Maybe 15 is a bit much, let me see:
---
8 ingots, these go for easily 1k
---
20 dark iron bar, usually around 10g each
---
50 arcanite bar around 30g each
---
25 essence of fire about 3g each
---
10 blood of the mountain/lava core and fiery core, about 10g each 
---
That brings it to just over 10k gold. But it massively depends on how expensive the ingots are.
---
Boo!
---
I'm leaving my job on august 23rd. I have a fesitival planned on 23rd, 24th and 25th, which will make me go to bed late in the morning. I'll wake up around 9pm on the 26th and the day after.
---
They’re doing interviews too. I imagine its hard to advertise for this without hating on the current game state. Anyways, I think they expect word of mouth to do a lot of the legwork for them.
---
From the top of my head, you split the xp proportionally from kills, but get a slight grouping bonus and will kill at least twice as fast. You will get full xp from quests though, which you will complete much faster. So in summary, grouped questing should be beneficial, you will just need to participate in more kills.
---
Midnight 0000
---
Every time I see a mage aoe leveling, I will drag mobs into his blizzard to get him killed.
---
It wont work in classic. Blue posts confirmed as such.
---
Not an intended mechanic.
---
This is so sadistic jesus fuck.
---
Layering won't make the world empty though. I'm expecting each starting area to be extremely full still
---
And you think he's the only noticing such a big bug? This is ridiculous.  
---
Instant casts don't reset the attack timer, that's it. Don't encourage him.
---
True.   How do you think is the most profitable way to level?
---
You know, I thought it was funny how rare leatherworking and blacksmithing will be (please, gods, don't reply explaining to me why that is. I know why that is) but on second look, the really interesting thing is that 20% of people leveling with leatherworking plan not to keep it at 60. I wonder if they're planning on getting their devilsaur, then changing?
---
Cruelty is pretty great at all points, apart from that fury is challenging if you cannot guarantee get Crit (by sitting for example).
---
If I was going Warrior I would do 3 rend, 2 deflection, 5 tact mastery, 1 anger management, 2 overpower, 3 deep wounds, 2 impale, 2h mastery and sweeping strikes into whichever weapon mastery. Fill until MS. Next points after MS go into cruelty.
---
The lich king killed his dad (the king of the alliance city lorderon) and was corrupted by frostmorne and both horde and alliance teamed up to kill him and both were betrayed by the forsaken
---
Lets be honest. We’ll be staring at this plenty on day 1.
---
12am is 00:00; 12pm is 12:00... don't ask me why, I know it's confusing....

Can't you just go in the boat too? There's a large inside area.

Ooh, I so don't wanna travel with an enemy priest on a ship.

That's true.  A friend of mine is going pve, so it's an easy decision for me.
---
&gt; Shows you how often I go to the wow websites or keep up with that. I forgot that they removed it technically, but you can still search for people. For example.
---
What?
---
Tbh You don't lose it to WoW or your commitment to WoW. You lose it because you don't really want it. I was playing Heroes Of Newerth (one of the first DotA clones) all day long for 5 years straight with a Team and training etc. and as soon as I had a new gf I played like 2 hours a week. I never put gaming over her. I played more after the first few months because that's just how it works when you sit ontop of eachother every day for a year.
---
And yes, of course she claimed I only care about games at some point. But I didn't. She didn't want to do anything. She had no hobbies (not exaggerating, we tried for find one for her for months) and I had gaming and went to the bar with friends at times (with her if she wanted, also club from time to time).
---
But after sitting ours in my bed with her phone in her hand she eventually figured she'd meet some friends. Sometimes with me, but it become boring as hell. Yes, I like your friends.. no, I don't like sitting in the city on stone for 8 hours each day, wandering from one side of the city to another. There weren't even topics to talk about. She didn't want to walk somewhere nice and we barely had money (student + trainee). So we were limited.
---
Just to be clear: I never, not a minute, played when she was with me EXCEPT when she was sleeping early and I couldn't yet. Even then I woke up before her, and got us food for breakfast.
---
After a year and a bit our relationship became the most soul-leeching experience ever, probably for both of us. I still loved her and tried my best, but she had a bigger package than I knew in the beginning with her. We tried to solve issues we both had, but she couldn't talk to me about anything serious. By that I mean as soon as it got serious (not loud or bad serious, just important stuff basically) she became mute and would not talk for ages. Most of it probably evolved by the treatment of her father/parents - as I already had to defend her in their apartment infront of him. It's a shame she didn't love me anymore after a bit and then I had to break up. But just to make sure: She never mentioned anything else than me playing games all day - when I was playing games with friends when she was doing something with their friends.
---
It's not the game that kills your relationship. It's your relationship that kills your relationship.
---
The slower the better. Make me wait 20 hours please.
---
Lol?
---
Are you honestly unable to transform letters into ideas?
---
What, in all of my posts in this threat, gave you the inclination that I think prot paladins are viable?
---
Dude, you had zero good points in that entire thread.
---
You said retail and classic are similar, he said no they are not and actually had well thought out points as to why and how they aren't similar.
---
You basically replied like a 6 year and said, "no u" to every point he made without a single counter-point.
---
Your debate skills are 'trash'. I would never, ever want you to back me up in an argument, it would be embarrassing.
---
You could have planned for it 9 months earlier.
---
A gnome among men.
---
 As someone who didn't play Vanilla (started in Legion) and has only ever played a rogue, would I be okay going with a Paladin? Is a Paladin viable for DPS? My two friends that I'll mainly be playing with are going rogue and warrior. I don't want to roll the same class as them so I figured Paladin might be cool. If not for DPS, should I focus on learning to heal? Can I be DPS/off-support?
---
While I have had to overcome some health complications over the course of my life, the IV fluids don't really contribute to their care - they're more about operating at peak performance. ~$2,000 a month (I've worked out a repeat discount) might seem like a lot, but there's really no amount of money I won't spend to save time or maximize the worth and enjoyment of that time.
---
These lvl 60s were also the players who was to shit to duel outside of IF and had to go kill lowbies to succeed at something.
---
For the first month, and with a buddy, you'll be a lot less likely to be camped. 
---
Ganked or attacked? Absolutely. Mostly by higher level rogues or pairs/groups, or someone knowing they'll lose trying to troll you. (Yes I will do that)
---
Camped? Somewhat unlikely. Not quite enough 60s for it to be frequent enough to worry about, I'd say
---
3 tanks are needed until 4h in naxx. druid is viable on everything except for a few fights like nefarian for instance due to mechanics. gl hf!
---
Mithril spike baby
---
Absolutely true, however he got demolished on the beta so doesn’t look like he will hold it for classic
---
Another example: https://streamable.com/cnr86  Notice the nameplate coming into view, he ganked me before.
---
Sadly this doesn't offset the big disadvantage of being vertically challenged. Not being in line of sight with your target because there's a tiny pebble in the way is really frustrating. 
---
These are things that noone tells you about in all their videos about what's the better racial for pve/pvp and can definitely be a gamechanger.
---
You're never going to have the absolute perfect comp. It's better to focus on class/spec synergy and making sure that your CC doesn't overlap for diminishing returns. Something like this for WSG:
---
1. Druid (Feral / Resto)
---
2. Druid (Feral / Resto)
---
3. Priest (Disc / Holy)
---
4. Paladin (Holy)
---
5. Paladin (Ret) OR Priest (Shadow)
---
6. Warrior
---
7. Rogue
---
8. Hunter
---
9. Mage
---
10. Warlock
---
This gets you every different type of CC, three defensive dispellers, one Mortal Strike, and one offensive dispel (two offensive dispels if you use a Shadow Priest instead of the Ret). The two Druids run flags and heal each other; the Hunter + Rogue sit in your base and defend it; and the other 6 players stick together as one group to return the flag.
---
Good, you'll be on a server with 50,000 people instead of 3,000.
---
You should be singing layering's praises.
---
Never. I'm against leveling add-ons, if I would be in Blizzard I would develop API in a way to break them all :-)
---
I got an instagram ad for Classic WoW and was thoroughly surprised.
---
This is not true. The water temple really isn't that hard, the thing that sucks about the water temple is that you constantly need to pause your game to equip/unequip your iron boots.
---
I fully understand his point. I also can't be assed to explain why it's bad advice
---
Yeah. Texas Mill had a crazy raid recently.
---
What's the reason for a level 5 bank alt over a level 1 bank alt?
---
&gt; Euganda
---
- exploring mostly to 5
---
- mostly delivery quests 5-10
---
- one 'collect 10' quest (cause it opens up an INCREDIBLE quest chain that has no competition)
---
- 4 elite quest kills (Vagash, Sathrah, Hogger, Princess) - they'll be simple with people around.
---
Once you start using the knuckle buttons on the Z, it makes you wonder how no else is copying it. It is so intuitive, it is like having extra left and right click buttons. For me it is worth every penny, and have been buying out extras for my backup mouse. I try to get them under 70.00 and so far have quite some backups.
---
go tailor enchanting right away to make your first wand ASAP, then i'd drop 1 for skinning, the other dont even worry about until 60.  drop skinning at 60 for whatever you want
---
No one is up voting them because no one is retarded enough to have read this entire thread.
---
I guess I am though. Although watching you act like a toddler is kinda like driving by a car wreck, you just can't look away.
---
The fact that you place so much value in upvotes is pretty cringey.
---
Then just watch the video and you'll see why you are completely wrong.  No arguing necessary.
---
Safe space from people like  Tmugsy
---
He absolutely has a point, that hakuri guide is the only one where warriors won’t struggle at points.
---
Joanas guides are great but they have sections like ‘send your pet to agro the whole ship then use FD to drop threat’ or something like that.
---
having streamers advertise it only gets it to a fraction of blizzards fanbase, not everyone watches streamers.
---
I downloaded the client for Classic today. I didn't really check the folder, so I didn't see that we could have a look at the login screen. Will go have a look right away!
---
Big downside: you can't play horde
---
I’ll probably be doing a lot of grading and lesson planning while simultaneously not playing nearly as much as I would like to.
---
just gotta keep out of LOS
---
We had pservers for 15 years and no such thing has ever been made.
---
Just equipping random items from the top 10 BiS list for each slot isn't going to get you very far if you're not hit/defense capped.
---
Groups are also often so desperate to fill empty spots that they will happily take under geared and even under level players
---
I'm gonna use it solely for addons, so won't really play much, I'll just use my main class to ensure that the add-ons work as intended for that :)
---
I'll try to get a party and leave the starting zone at level 1 and farm higher level mobs
---
Woah that's the voice of techno beat drop button!
---
In stress test and beta, the respawn was no longer than 10 seconds.  
---
There is an important note to make here though. If the item is a unique ground item, it has a fast respawn. I did the Milly's Grape quest in Northshire and the Mushroom and Lily quest in Shadowglen on the beta and those items take a long time to respawn since they're not unique.
---
Hmm. Do you plan to do this on launch? I've seen people do sub-2 hours to level 10, so not sure that 4 hours is worth it imo, other than it's pretty guaranteed.
---
Literally this, I could tell you which server that is based on their pvp tokens quest, most of the pvp'ers are running around in rank 13 gear and/or T2.5. You will be eaten alive as any class. Also he showed a lot of 1v3 and 1v4 footage for the T0 example and a lot more 1v1, 2v1 etc footage for the higher geared footage. 
---
Like it's clearly meant to be a joke/meme video, so thats fine, but take it for what it is, don't just assume that being a warrior is shite and you're going to suffer.
---
Yes, I definitely feel better after the IV therapy. It completely removes exhaustion from hangovers, exercise, jet lag, etc. The best way I describe it is a "glow".
---
Can you PM me more about this?
---
&gt; Except for the realms that were down for a few days.
---
sauce for servers that went down for BFA or Legion for 'a few days' ?
---
Your reading comprehension that bad?
---
I think so but others may not. The resto tree has talents to make you start off with rage when you shift forms. It's a great all around class and in a halfway decent group if your tank goes down you could shift to bear form and tank while of the DPS heals. It's a niche thing but if you know how to play your **class** and not just your **spec** it makes all the difference in the world.
---
Never said there's anything wrong with that, just putting it out there as a healthy counter-opinion.
---
If there's anyone that has never experienced Vanilla WoW, or it's been 14 years, I would recommend not using an add-on. The leveling and questing is part of the magic. Figuring out where to go and what to do is such a big part of the immersion process.
---
Fair. I've seen the video. The guy is running checks against hashes with a defined dictionary.
---
You seem to have omitted the part where I equated reading your entire thread to driving by a burning car wreck.
---
I guess being cringey as fuck for your entire life will probably do that though. Gotta protect your ego somehow. 
---
Cherry pick the part of my comment to turn against me and make yourself look good. You're only making yourself look like more of a neckbeard.
---
This is 2019, who the hell wants to do a dungeon for 5 hours? Fuck that noise
---
Work from home but my job is extremely easy as in I basically do nothing.
---
Two friends of mine will take a few days off and we will set up in my living room. Going to make a HUGE pot of chili because it's delicious and easy to heat up over the next 3 days. Three bros eating a huge pot of chili and playing WoW for 3 or 4 days. My girlfriend is gonna love me so much!
---
As for launch itself, I plan on not sleeping the first night with a little nap during morning time hours and continuing that schedule until I'm way ahead of the pack. Don't care about being 60 but definitely don't want to be getting ganked 24/7
---
If I decide to waste my time with something, then at least let me do it myway, thenks
---
Put a HR in charge of hiring, and he'll hire more HR. Same goes for programmers and everything else.
---
I made that up entirely. Heck knows if it's true. But it sounds neat and clever.
---
literally has no impact on OP's question
---
Doesn't beastmaster spec have some talents to improve your pet rez?
---
How does buff stacking work in Classic? How many buffs can you have active? Which are mutually exclusive (i.e. elixers/flasks) and which ones stack? (multiple food buffs? world buffs?)
---
Many folks here reference buffs to be the key to early progression through raids and that it compensates for lack of gear to a large extend.
---
Could someone provide a detailed answer or link to a detailed guide that explains how the buff mechanics work in Classic?
---
Joanas 1-40 alliance is quite good. I'll be using that then switching to hakurai's most likely.
---
Attunements, farm rare items before anyone can get there, get BiS gear before raids, help guildies run instances, farm epic mount
---
If we haven't heard from the ElvUI developers in the next few days, I'll write up a guide.
---
I usually go here:  [http://www.logicalincrements.com/](http://www.logicalincrements.com/)   when looking for a build. They have a build for every budget.
---
 How will the leveling experience be as a healer? I've never played a healer before. Would it be hard for me to learn? 
---
 Warrior is an option for me I guess because it turns out my friend who is rolling warrior is going Horde. I am a fan of plate armor so it was between Warrior and Pally.
---
Ah yes the famous dranei warrior in vanilla.
---
Yeah, pay x to get in the park and 3x to actually enjoy the park. They're making a killing.
---
The people that paid x will spend their day buying food and riding 5 rides.
---
I didn't. I've been patiently waiting for classic, and not obsessing over it. It turns out, you can be pretty prepared for the launch of a game even if you only look into it near release.
---
Lol okay - starting zones are the only reason layering exists... if blizzard implemented them to limit starting zones from 10k players to 500 players... that still wouldn't be "playable" which is the what layering is based off of.
---
Launch will be fine once we can get in and start playing... that's going to be the issue, servers being stable for the first 2 hours.
---
I miss the trauma of bad deadmines groups
---
4 through 6 would be average, yea.
---
Nice pun
---
ElvUI is indeed originally built from TukUI. But ElvUI is much more than just a different skin. I'm aware that TukUI has a working version for classic and ElvUI does not.
---
He said " I has to sit at item spawns with 10+ other people".
---
Maybe read the post and not just the title, albert...
---
JoKeS
---
Rather than crucifying you, you've had enough of that, let me offer a constructive argument
---
Doesn't really work like that. Just because "Item X" is worth 10 points to one Rogue, doesn't mean it's worth 10 points to another. 
---
A lot of itemization has to do with the cumulation of everything else equiped.
---
Some BIS isn't BIS until you have other pieces of BIS. 
---
Know what I mean?
---
I actually thought OP was serious at first, then I started to read his replies and realized he was just trolling.
---
&gt; And lastly, a personal route I tested like day 3 of beta when there were still a ton of people leveling, I did 5 in 20mins, and 10 in 1hr 45min.
---
Well, I'm sure you also noticed how u/Warpborne dodged the question, and justified his objectively worse and slower macros/keybind by him having other keybinds that would break if he made his warrior keybinds and macros better (which is completely irrelevant to his Warrior Macro Suite).
---
&gt; I'd hope people don't just copy paste anything they see and jump into the game.
---
That's the thing. Look at the comments on this topic. "Saved this for launch". "I don't understand macro" and so on... People that don't know macros WILL just copy/paste this. And they won't realise they are handicapping themselves, because OP linked objectively worse macros/keybinds and painted them in a rosy light.
---
People that DO understand macros go "Wait a minute... Isn't that a bad way to do it?" And it is.
---
Good for alts.
---
I always jump on top of the crate that's *slightly* to tall to normall jump on, even for a Night Elf by leaping off the rigging that OP is standing on. Not only is it funny watching people try to jump on it as well and failing it's also a great defensible position against gankers since unless they know how to reach it or a ranged class they won't be able to easily damage me.
---
\*already\* happened
---
wtf?
---
I was serious at first, as I do see some sort of thing like this happening and I was wondering how best to counter or not to counter such a thing. (as well, in a #nochanges world an addon like this should be possible)
---
But you can't really have a serious talk on these matters on this reddit.
---
I believe that google runs complex algorithms to select what search results are displayed and which ones are not. And that people deliberately tweak those algorithms to fit their political biases, and to censor information which threatens the status quo. Whether those people work for google or the government, I do not know. Probably both.
---
I am sure they are using complex technologies such as machine learning and AI to create their search algorithms. But I see no reason to believe google's computers have become sentient. All the malice and censorship we see coming out of google can easily be explained by human folly.
---
&gt; Sadly this doesn't offset the big disadvantage of being vertically challenged. Not being in line of sight with your target because there's a tiny pebble in the way is really frustrating. 
---
Or having to swim through small puddles of water that other races can walk through. I vaguely recall that being something I made fun of in the past, being a horde player.
---
[Don't be so hard on yourself kid!](https://imgur.com/c75N82M)
---
It's really funny/annoying when my friends that don't play wow but do play hearthstone don't understand that everything in it came from WoW before that
---
I have always used the shortest and most basic passwords any site or bank will allow and ive never in my life had an issue
---
1. Yes its possible
---
2. Its a lot of work. 
---
3. All the important items are already in every guide telling you what's best and what the best substitutes are. Along with most greens.
---
4. There are much better ways of filtering raiders, then condensing their existence into a stupid number.
---
5. If you use a gear score to filter people for dungeons your garbage and you'll likely get on some blacklists for it.
---
6. Its not difficult to compare 2 pieces of gear to each other. Some people (people who play classic) would say that's part of the fun.
---
&gt; Tmugsy
---
You can always avoid a streamer server. If you are in EU like me, chances of starting on a streamer server are slim.
---
Warlocks are actually among top dps.
---
I was helping you make a better argument.  If you want to go deeper, computerphile discuss that comic specifically in a follow up video.  It's easy to find on their channel.
---
They explain how it has limited value and how to improve on his idea.  The video is 3 years old, so there's no reason that anyone interested in password cracking wouldn't have watched it. So I assume you're not, and you just saw the comic and thought it was cool.
---
Moral of the story: don't criticise someone unless you actually know what you're talking about.
---
Fully with you.  
---
Hate my job, can't leave due to mortgage/kid etc ah well! :(
---
It was supposed to be a reference when Kyle and Stan ask cartmam what they are supposed to do after they kill the mage in South parks riff on WoW. He says, what do you mean? Now we can play the game. Then goes into giving guild mater commands to the rest of the gang. Such a good episode. But yeah I totally understand, end game is why I started playing in the first place. Mostly because all my fiends were already 70 shortly after BC came out. So I rushed to max level asap.
---
I'd argue the argument is originally made when they advertised vanilla back in the day.
---
The argument can actually be made that the content to advertise with is already there so the only expense is hosting costs. I appreciate you trying to call me out for this shit but you must agree that not advertising publicly this game is an actual problem. A dire problem and a fucking ridiculous move from any company quite frankly. 
---
and happy cake day, yah filthy animal.
---
Love it. Great work
---
Anger Management is worthless
---
Nah, it happens every year, that article just gives the best description. [This year the Darkmoon Faire is an exclusive pre-event](https://blizzcon.com/en-gb/news/22955736/welcome-to-blizzcon%C2%AE-2019-25-04-2019).
---
you can cheap shot any direction and that's what rogues open with what does that even do?
---
Lulz!
---
I don't see the connection between having played on a private server and being a shady racist character. What are you on about lol?
---
They'll never do it but that's a badass idea. Maybe if you write to them and first class that shit we MIGHT actually get the idea in their head? that'd be awesome :D Not sure if any decent rom-coms are out at the moment though, might have to go and ask r/movies for help haha
---
Upvoted for visibility. This needs to be handled.
---
because it affects questing routes
---
It takes 14min to run/fly to SW for questing in elwynn forest if you need.
---
I made some edits you probably didn't see.
---
I'm aware of the other videos. I just honestly didn't want to place a large amount of effort into this.
---
ya possibly, would suck to run into a city and find none though
---
Or twice that.
---
He's not talking about brute forcing. He's talking about a dictionary attack.
---
The backbone of the changes needed to get ElvUI working for Classic are near identical to the changes needed to get TukUI working for Classic. This is why I had success with ElvUI on the Classic Beta/Tests using the TukUI alpha releases.
---
AM represents all the morning hours. 12AM is all the minutes before 1AM. You wouldn't jump from 12:59PM to 01:00AM. The clock starts at 0000, not 0100.
---
Trying to explain it in a way you can remember instead of "just know which is which".
---
Ha are you sure? It’s one of the best talents for warriors
---
Did you see the stress test pictures? You can't even see a foot in front of you. Layering is going to make it go from 10k to a lower number. There was just an interview and if I remember it correctly, Blizzard said they had the limit be 2500 players per layer and they called that a low number because they wanted to see how many layers they could hold to stress the servers.
---
So with that known, I'd guess the layers will hold ~4k players.
---
The starting zones are going to be very crowded
---
No I didn't see your edits.
---
I just thought to challenge you, since you send very sure of yourself.
---
You think?...
---
you... you don't think there's going to be 10+ players cause of layering?
---
&gt; Which classes actually wear the majority of their tier sets during raiding as viable gear and not just for cosmetics?
---
If the current theorycraft is correct, Ret Paladins in T2 for spelladin is pretty much BIS forever (no competition in gear = more gear for the rest of the raid, too!)
---
I probably will use some kind of questing addon
---
There’s a working version of WA2 floating around out there already.
---
my first char was a hgunter but i rerolled at 14 because a friend told me i should play warrior. iplayed that warrior untill wotlk came out and in hindsight really regret that. now i main a hunter again since cata so.. first choice best choice i guess
---
Any data base for vanilla.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.8
---
Most of the spells for level 1 are talent "spells".
---
&gt; How will the leveling experience be as a healer? 
---
Level as DPS then respec.
---
OMG! My bad!!
---
I don't understand.
---
If I’m leveling professions I’m slowing my progress to 60. Gotta get to 60 asap.
---
Can’t use backstab or ambush without a dagger
---
Fucking great
---
AFAIK a lot of semi-hardcore guilds on N*dale run a feral as say tank 3.
---
&gt; Expect problems so you dont get dissapointed
---
I feel like this is my philosophy of life.
---
Why do you want this?
---
This is already common knowledge. Those formulas have been on the wikis for over a decade. Magey was just confirming they're the same in Classic.
---
Ah, of course. Had a brain fart.
---
Blizzard knows what they are doing in that they don't want Classic WoW to succeed.  It's not profitable for them.  It's not the direction they want to take the game. It's a bastard project for them.  I'm sure those working on it internally get a lot of corporate politics grief thrown at them.
---
Someone using a 24hr notation may not know that, like OP
---
Or they can make enough servers... there’s that.
---
That's not a great spot.  You can climb the rigging on the starboard side of the ship and jump to the yardarm.  Anyone trying to get to you risks missing their footing and getting wet.
---
Lol no worries it happens
---
Not as dramatic, but my school grades absolutely plummeted when I joined a more hardcore raiding guild. I lost my summer mornings to repeating 2 classes I could’ve easily passed if I had my priorities straight.
---
everyone has to buy spells though
---
Also the mage tower with its portals (not there in Cata but there now) and the area behind the city with the portals to Cata dungeons.
---
Yes, it's true and has been known since Vanilla. The only thing we didn't know is the reason behind still missing at 300 skill with 8% hit.
---
https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds
---
Joana will have an in game addon guide for paid members on his site. I will 10000% use it.
---
It wouldn't make sense to be able to reserve names without knowing the server, I suppose. Either you'd only be able to reserve completely unique names (which would be strange, since the same name can exist on different servers) or you'd be randomly assigned a server after the name reserve (which would make it impossible for anyone trying to play with a friend - not to mention an entire guild). So while I haven't heard any explicit news about servers on name reserve day, I figure it must be the case.
---
a dictionary attack is a brute force attack
---
Irrelevant - even with the 24hr clock there is no 12 am = mid day.
---
Idk if he is a streamer, but he is a racist.  There was a thread about it posted earlier.
---
&gt; If you can sell an item for several hundred gold that could potentially get you your epic mount. 
---
Not even for mount. Someone else's BIS drops in a dungeon and sells for 500G on ah, and your BIS is 500G on the AH...
---
That drop is BIS for BOTH of you. You might nust need an extra step.
---
Found the first to get to 60!
---
I’m not fine with it either. I’ve gkicked people for it in the past. You’re right I kinda did take it to RL... but I was also curious if there were studies for racism in an online setting.
---
1.  It doesn't matter if it didn't exist in Vanilla.  They aren't going to unhook the server so you cannot see characters out of game.  It doesn't change anything in game at all.
---
2. It takes an hour and a half to hit 10 in classic.  Push it to 2 hours for early bottle necks.  So instead of within minutes, change it to within a couple hours.
---
They will be found out extremely fast, period.  Sorry if you are an asshurt fan boy lol.
---
Excellent point!
---
It's gonna be midnight here, and i have to work the day after. So for me i'll take it quite easy. If everything is smooth sailing ill aim for level 8 before bed. Then just 2 levels more before i get a pet and it'll be happy days from there.
---
Not being able to shadowmeld -&gt; MC people off boats is the only thing I'm going to miss about going horde.
---
I’ve been routing 1-10 in teld and it’s about 2 hours to 10, and then another 1 1/2 hours to 12. Running from teld -&gt; kharanos is going to be about half an hour right there. The only benefit is you save yourself the time making that run in the future, but since you’re going to be doing 12-17 in darkshore anyways, it makes more sense to just stay in teld. That route involves a little bit of grinding(about a level and a half, but if you grind while you move it’s not bad), but it also limits wasting time just travevling.
---
Looks like the fun police have arrived.
---
Lol. I never had that problem in vanilla. Only on pservers. Cross realm anything should die in a fire.
---
There's a hard cap of buffs it's fairly high but not unreachable with full worldbuffs. I cannot remember exactly what it is. Maybe like 36?
---
The rules for stacking buffs are pretty loose. Generally if two buffs give the exact same stat(like arcane intelligent and a scroll of int ), then it doesn't stack, but with some exceptions of special buffs like flasks, potions, juju's(consumables gained from winterspring) and such. I think there's a couple guides out there for indivual classes on what stacks and doesn't. You cannot have multiple food buffs, and food buffs stacks with anything, and world buffs stack with anything and you can have multiple of them. 
---
I would advice going through your indivual class to get a glimpse at how buffing stacks, rather than a total view, because it's quite complicated. Here's a doc I found: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml
---
Rush to 60 without an addon. Lol. You're salty in both threads I've posted today.
---
Just cause you're miserable irl doesn't mean we want to deal with it
---
nope
---
Lots of people selling them in the 2nd town( like goldshire etc.)
---
What's wrong with it
---
I think twitch and youtube have taken over the tv watching for anyone under 40
---
wont need to do this on the server im gonna play on luckily
---
The stress test might be a better option to work that out and save a bit of time
---
That's so Classic (TM)
---
I would heavily advice against leveling as healer. Just level as a dps spec you can still heal dungeons just fine. As for healing at 60, no it's not too difficult. It's pretty easy to get in to but very hard to master.
---
Don't forget my [Sage 1-60 alliance leveling guide](https://sage-guide.netlify.com)! One of the most complete and feature rich ones out there and completely free to use forever.
---
You arent...... you can't be.....
---
You cannot be this simple can you&gt;?  Do you think Esfand, soda, asmon, and every other big streamer WONT be streaming?  
---
This is how it will play out.  I'll explain so you don't hurt yourself trying to think about it.
---
1. Guildie of guild that doesnt want to be stuck on a shit server (normally what happens when a streamer or streamers as big as these guys abandon the game).
---
2. They roll on server A
---
3. Run up to human pally named Esfand WITH ESFAND'S STREAM UP!!!!!
---
4. Stay with me now bro
---
5. They see themselves jumping up and down on stream.  
---
6. GAAAAAAAAAAAASP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
7. THEY FOUND ESFAND
---
See how it works?  Do ya?  If they see the player Esfand, pull up his stream and its obviously not him, then they move onto the next pvp server, which there will be only a handful of.
---
&gt; You are flat out wrong if you think the stress test pictures resemble anything close to launch.
---
Wait, are you trolling or are you actually this stupid? Please tell me you're not this dumb
---
We know. It’s been a news two months ago already
---
Fucking shamans represent!
---
Yes if you are night elf you should obviously not follow my guide until I get to Darkshore, I state that in the introduction before the guide.
---
I will be living off of Lunchables.
---
Still dumb that it doesn't have its own tab. Starcraft I and Warcraft III have their own tabs, one of which didn't really succeed in creating the hype they hoped for, and the other remaster isn't even close to being out yet.
---
But the game that is going to attract far more players than either of those? Nope can't give it a tab.
---
Delete this now. As a future rogue you are spoiling my plans ahah. I’ll be picking on gnomes specifically...
---
Dungeon lockouts are the exact same on pservers with the small exception that getting out of the dungeon either requires you to run or get a friend to help you. Pservers made this possible to do solo because everyone just ran a second account to do it.
---
It’s all relative to what you consider ‘healthy’.
---
Some consider grinding to 60 as fast as possible the true challenge.
---
Others want to experience the slow grind to 60, and explore. 
---
Classic was made and tailored to that approach I feel. 
---
Take the time, or rush. Either way - play how you want. 
---
Personally - I won’t be dungeon grinding. I will try to be efficient, but it’s fine for me. I know I won’t be server first or 100th. Take the time, enjoy that experience once again. It’s all nostalgia for me.
---
How does this work for rogues? We can get 5 wep skill from talents. What does this mean for human rogue vs non human? Does it negate the opness of sword racial? How much difference dies it make between 305 and 310?
---
The mage tower was there. Just not the expanded portal room.
---
I can't imagine they'll \*stop\* streaming entirely for very long? They have an audience to think about, and that audience is going to flock to whoever is actually streaming. 1-2 days in, I'm sure people will know what servers to avoid, and anyone but the absolute most die hard players pushing for world firsts can simply reroll.
---
(Here's hoping the streamers won't reroll... lol)
---
I'm going to play the game like a normal human being and then laugh at all the tryhards when they start complaining about nothing to do after they rushed all the content
---
I know in the beta it wasn't long before people started selling, or even handing out, wands in elwynn and durotar.
---
it's gonna happenw ithout a doubt. wether or not it will be used by the majority of people that remains to be seen, i personally doubt it because of vanilla's super weird itemization
---
Its  worth it when leveling just for the slowed rage decay, not even for the free 1rage/3sec.
---
The problem really is just amount of mob spawns. If there's plenty of them, then duo is good, if there's limited then duo is bad.
---
I've seen a couple sponsored posts on twitter about classic wow.
---
Well I guess being the first hunter or druid to 60 is a good way to get a raid spot in a serious raiding guild.
---
Dungeon grinding is only better is certain pockets on your way to 60 and only if you plan your group to maximize that effect. Not all classes will be wanted and not all dungeons are good for running more than once.
---
* Cruelty for first 5 Points.
---
* 3/3 Rend, 2/5 Deflection
---
* 5/5 TM &amp; Anger Management
---
* 3/3 Deep Wounds, 1 Point in Imp. OP
---
* 2/2 Impale, 2nd Point in Imp. OP
---
* Two in Imp Charge or Imp Parry, depending if you quest or dungeon more
---
* Sweeping Strikes
---
By then you'll be 35 with your (probably) Axe from the class quest, so your next points are basically personal preference built on your playstyle. Depending on if you PvP more you might want points in Imp. Hamstring or fill out Deflection since Parry is pretty great during leveling, or put some in Imp. Charge if you find yourself using charge nearly every fight and want the extra rage. Once you get 40 you're probably best off respecing for MS since it's so cheap to do at that point. I really like Piercing Howl, so I've tried going PH early and then going into Arms and that's also pretty fun for early dungeon runs since it corrals mobs so well... but Arms just has more by way of reliable damage.

---
I never played warrior, is it really that fun / rewarding?
---
ty
---
It really is the greatest game ever made. All the violence and grinding and flightpath time take a backseat to the feelibg of adventure, exploration, travel, and community. Three weeks and we will be back home!
---
God bless!
---
Knowing which items are good for each class is not some rocket science knowledge. 
---
If a guy links you Nefarian, Chromaggus or Rag loot then you would instantly know that the he already has some experience in these raids and grouping with him is a safe bet. Tells you even more than gearscore numbers do, actually. 
---
For pre-bis, it's usually the best to link weapons for melee and casters, since they are the hardest to obtain.
---
I swear, we are so blue balled and cock teased as a community that we fawn over the possibility of opening the game.
---
I love it, I’m no better. Hyped for the 27th, 23 days to go.
---
You're not projecting at alllllll...
---
If you've never leveled to 60 multiple times - you ain't rushing no where.
---
Have fun double and tripling back! Oh and see you at 60 in 20 days /played OMEGALUL-
---
\+1 to crit means I get all my mana back more often not for dps
---
Not what was asked but still good advice!
---
Just check out this glorious troll 
---
https://youtu.be/q5mD1n4v2JA?t=90
---
I agree - I was just commenting on the utility of shadow guard.  I actually still think UD is better.
---
Most players can't/won't-bother-to find 4 other dedicated and skilled group mates to power grind to 60. So i doubt it will be a major issue. Your zones will still be full of randoms doing their thing.
---
Makes you look constantly paranoid.  Because you are.  At that point, the rogues have won.
---
We don't know for sure but some guy asked a blizz dude on twitter and he indicated that it would be blizzlike thus phase 2.
---
NE is just as good.
---
Well you just need to know kind of stats their class prefers, then see if his best items are aimed in the right direction:)
---
Almost no one grinds dungeons. 
---
But certain group comps could grind for like 8 hour sessions or so and likely speed run to 60 fastest.
---
Only shitty thing about classic world pvp is that it doesn't matter if you die. There's a private server called "Project Ascension" where you drop stuff if you die to a player close to your level. Wish they'd introduce Risk PvP servers for classic, it's such a fun concept. As it stands without ranked arenas, there's no PvP endgame at all.
---
eh idk, the run from mulgore to any starting area is brutal, and if you go to valley of trials you're going from a less populated one to the MOST populated one. I wouldn't recommend.
---
I'm confused?
---
That's really good to know, thanks. It's amazing how much of this shit I've forgotten (or never learned in the first place) so I appreciate you all taking the time out to educate me. :)

Shifting triggers GCD so it would be clunky and not much use.
---
&gt; If you've never leveled to 60 multiple times - you ain't rushing no where.
---
baseless assumption nice! I've been playing since the game was in beta, I'm not a noob. No way in hell I'm going to remember everything from way back when though. 
---
Stay miserable little nerd!
---
Snacks are going to be important. Logging off at midnight is childsplay.  I will be playing from 3pm launch day til probably around 7am. 
---
Caffeine will help and I never drink energy drinks, so it will be a treat.  I am thinking after midnight I'll probably have about one an hour to stay up an alert.  For food, something I can eat while playing, so pizza or sandwich foods. Whole carrots are filling and easy to eat while playing so some of those too.  Honestly I dont get to hungry while playing wow.
---
Seeing as 12pm is noon, I dunno what else 12am could be.
---
Your friend thinks brown people should be in jail for being brown. That's racism. Thus, your friend is a racist. This isn't rocket surgery.
---
 If you had never mentioned you were German, I would have never brought it up. You're the one bringing Nazis into the conversation.
---
I mean, you think your friend saying brown people should go to jail is harmless. It's not. You're an enabler of bad racist behavior. I don't know how I can make this any more clear. Instead of insisting that it's all harmless jokes, fix your shit. Do some introspective on why you're so flippant on things that promote racism.
---
I was also commenting that I'm happy you won't be on a NA server, due to the whole German thing but I guess that was too hard to follow.
---
Depends on the weapon realy, but yes generally swords is better. You won't be rolling against paladins.
---
i dont get the hate for pandas. pandaria was a really good expantion overall and the race may be goofy but you dont see anyone complaining about cow people or space goats?
---
Yeah. Play the game and enjoy yourself. Proven strategy.
---
He's a depressed little troll who goes on threads for the sake of arguing his terrible logic. I'd just ignore his dumbass and move on haha
---
And there will be those players that only run in what they personally consider ideal comps. Then there is the rest of the player base, the majority of them, who do not have the time or will to commit to grinding rank 14. Then you have all the ones with the time and will but a lack of skill.
---
More than enough room for a Druid skilled or unskilled.
---
That's a myth. It has to be a real, latex condom. None if this bread bag and rubberband home-brew nonsense.
---
Never had, never will
---
It may very well be BiS. Idk shit about paladins. I was making a joke about how in vanilla a lot of paladins swore up and down that they could make use of virtually any gear that dropped. It was almost as big a meme as the “no that’s hunter loot”’think that the hunters did.
---
if you would've actually played on a pserver you would know that it's like 2% of the server who spends their time trolling in world chat/general chat, the rest are normal players who just like vanilla. You'd prefer to hate on the 98% for something they have no part in though.
---
I'm already in a decent guild with local players but I don't get what your trying to say.  
---
Your talking about Molten Core? On pservers I have pugged Naxx a bunch of times. 
---
 It's not like the content is difficult at any stage. It's just grinding again. Grind the resist gear mostly. Bigwigs make sure even the new players know what to do in an encounters.
---
2-4%
---
Kul! Har länkat i Regementets discord! Hoppas på att kunna joina!
---
Yeah that MC pug with 39 players who already killed rag and you is probably going to be easy.
---
its one of the rarest world drop boes and will be worth A LOT of gold
---
Not healthy at all. we'll see how good it actually is though.
---
It seems to be the fastest way to level, but only for certain classes. Not every class fits into a dungeon grind group and not every class levels faster through a dungeon grind group. And it will absolutely never be the dominant way to play because it's so intensive time-wise and requires a dedicated group.
---
Can't parry with no weapon!
---
&gt; well-known servers at the time
---
Apparently not.
---
You can learn gathering professions but not production professions (including enchanting)
---
*You can't really have a serious talk on these matters on this reddit?*
---
Oooh for sure we can. And everybody is god damn serious in this thread : keep this GearScore bullshit for retail.
---
GearScore, achievements, flying mount, lfr/lfg, wow tokens, Raider.IO, sharding, Azerite/Fel farming, mandatory daily quests, Titanforge, max level boosts... Please spare WoW Classic from all this kind of crap, would you?
---
Probably the same people that have liked doing it for the past 15 yrs.
---
you can play 25/26/0 aswell. you will be able to heal in pve, farm solo and pvp in that spec. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVEu0xoZVGkccbx
---
the last point can go into blessing of sanctuary or holy power. your raid needs 1 paladin with BoS anyways
---
5 Cruelty, then 31 Arms, then 15 Prot is the latest addition to the warrior leveling meta. This allows you to get that sweet 5% crit online in the early levels when all you do is auto-attack, you get Sweeping Strikes one level before Whirlwind, and Mortal Strike right when you upgrade from your WW axe to e.g. the Maraudon axe. However, the delayed MS does sting a little.
---
Towards the end, when you are about to spam tank BRD from and then tank 60 dungeons, you will also get Last Stand at 56 and a few points in Defiance to round out your dungeon spam as main tank.
---
However, you could also just keep it simple and go 31/20/0 afterwards, to get Enrage. Or just go Arms all the way.
---
This might sound counterintuitive given the name but I’m vaguely recalling Tauren mill had a very forsaken heavy story line?
---
I'll play the day before release, better option!
---
Gotcha! Thanks for the clarification
---
Your confusion isn't unwarranted, because 12 is the last hour  before cycling back to 1. But the 12th and last hour is treated as 0 and first hour.
---
I wonder who came up with this?
---
He's not talking about the soda
---
My handle is jimmyfromfinance but in real life I’m James from Data Science 😰
---
$15 is cheap for a demon cock. Have you seen how expensive bad dragon is?
---
I mean, they can also give you a million dollars, there's that.
---
dont suck
---
Wow they finally added an invisible barrier on the side of the boat
---
And Reddit is the place to get accurate information then?
---
Yeah it confuses me too, it feels like a missed opportunity to show it off as it’s own thing
---
Yes, an addon will likely add that functionality, the syntax may differ
---
Because azeroth was dead content except for deadwind pass. Everyone was on Outland, or in capital cities. They weren't out in azeroth doing stuff.
---
Don't worry, the enemy priest will end your travels quickly.
---
Someone sure is trying to push the "casuals and tryhards hate one another" narrative today.  This is the second one of these threads.
---
Honestly, it's probably a thing where they aren't able, via whichever reason, to compete with the speedy levelers, so they try to find an argument that emboldens themselves into thinking they are doing it right and the quick levelers are doing it wrong. When in reality, each individual person is doing it right in however way they choose. 
---
Maybe this makes sense.
---
Playing till early morning chugging lemon iced tea, avoiding the energy drinks so i can get 4-5 hours sleep and start again. I'll probably go back to playing normal hours after the initial honeymoon period.
---
Im a slav and i dont even care about anyone calling me that, no slav does were even proud about it. 
---
So what is your point? I guess the n word is an insult linked to slavery.? Guess where the word slavery comes from.
---
What proof do you have to support that argument?
---
Look at the pvp vendor gear (which won’t be available phase 1) and base your gear orientation on those stats
---
Grimpvp.
---
Undead Rogue.
---
The lower druid tier gear in raids is kind of for jack-of-all-trades, with the set bonuses not always the greatest. That's why we do instances to gear up and concentrate on +healing. Check out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml# for healing gear and look for five man stuff.
---
So i got another question.
---
I have a EU account and can only select german servers on retail because there are dedicated german servers.
---
Now i got another buddy from spain which will not get dedicated spain only servers.
---
Which one will he be able to join ? 
---
This is gonna be a tricky thing to get us all togther if we can only choose between 3 regions.
---
Who beat his time?
---
I took the day before launch off of work to get my body on the right sleep schedule.  Since launch is 5pm here, gotta stay up all night.
---
The 40s seem like such a breeze to me. Stranglethorn alone knocks out at least 5 levels. Then the 50+ grind. Makes me 😓😬 so hard.
---
Sure hot shot
---
What's unhealthy is these posts. Regardless of what the answer to your question is, you can't change a thing. The energy I spent even responding to this post is a waste.
---
Oh well this sucks.
---
Yeah it's really sad how people used to talk how it's going to be a nice trip to 60 and enjoy it but now suddenly it seems like every other thread is about how to go full autist and make sure to avoid everything nice in the game by powerleveling as fast as possible.
---
Saved Addis’s
---
The only thing we hate are these shitposts.
---
Dominoes Master race and stock raid frames 😯😯😯
---
&gt;english vocals
---
Holy shit what are you doing?
---
I’d guess the Twitch App will have Classic Addons included. Even Private Server Addons can be downloaded and updated there.
---
I really like the DKP shop idea. My guild is going loot council...can't wait for the drama.
---
&gt; gear for example has stats for every spec.
---
Welcome to Vanilla, have some spirit to go with your strength and some agility to top it all off!
---
&gt;Do i have to raid to be viable in PVP?
---
Depends on what you consider to be viable, but you will definatly be at a disadvantage.
---
Winterspring is not alliance only,  both factions level and quest there
---
Duskwood in my opinion is the most enjoyable leveling zone in the game. Very spooky atmosphere, multiple quest chains with interesting storylines, Stitches patrolling the road etc etc..
---
I will be playing as Horde, but yeah, Duskwood is pretty awesome for Alliance
---
Yes, won´t be using Joana, etc. to enjoy leveling a bit more.
---
I will be using several google docs, like [the hunter spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DKl7jL4HJ2hAQ7iHAzEMs_6uqTFYpruh6m6VAmA9cZk/edit#gid=1985929127), [fishing+cooking leveling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZCTbQQXfOv1KXBJokHYGt35zNdAqVaV/view) and some other stuff.
---
This is what we should post, every time someone mention "the right way" to do things.
---
[My way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn8vzTsnPps)
---
Melee leeway only affects running with your back turned and running.  If you backpedal, no leeway.  Get outta here.
---
Same story as in almost every Addon. 2 fractions that want the same fighting over it (Horde vs Alliance) and in the end a bigger evil shows up that we care about.
---
What I’ve seen is that it’s not the casual vs efficient, it’s people vs. the ones that feel forced to level quick and efficiently. Some people come in here. Read too much into shit, and think “oh if I don’t level fast enough I won’t get groups and never get to raid and be locked out of content” then people come in and tell them that that’s not true, they don’t have to grind levels faster than everyone else. There was literally a post on the front page about just that a couple days ago. The community makes certain players feel like if they don’t play a certain way, they will fail and be locked out of content. I don’t blame either side, it’s just how things go, and will always be.
---
Once again Pservers had it wrong. The respawn rates were very fast.
---
We have none of this information. 
---
We would expect that they give a server list this week to allow for coordination, but nothing is confirmed.
---
Racist jokes = Racism
---
People act like most of us didn’t level in vanilla with thottbot opened in another tab helping us figure these vague ass quests out.
---
Why does every video game have to have some group of casual elitists yelling at everyone demanding they play how they play.
---
You dont want enchanting while leveling your first character. It kills your income disenchanting your greens.
---
Oh yeah, nice one didn't think of that.  8)
---
Oh ye sorry that's what I ment.
---
Aside from instances, where is a good place to level up weapon skils once you reach close to 350 (or wtvr max is). All the end zones mobs are like 58 and under. I need to smack level 59 and 60s but forget where they all are &gt;&lt;
---
Doesn't that only happen when you're moving?  Standing still in the back corner under those stairs shouldn't trigger it.
---
I used to do passwords based on what was around me at the time when I was super young like I remember hairypringle being a password aswell as mojojojo123 but I stopped doing that when I grew up.
---
I do not think you will make much of a profit disenchanting all your bound greens/blues vs just vendoring them (if you make any profit at all tbh). It's not really something you make profit off of while leveling, but you can definitely make good profit at end game with the right recipes and it's worth leveling with it if you plan on keeping it.
---
Here how the world and wikipedia sees it :
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke
---
First sentence :
---
"A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is not meant to be taken seriously."
---
If you can argue anything it would be if its a good joke.
---
There are comments from as early as 1.11.2 mentioning you can switch Engineering specifically: [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11811/narain-soothfancy#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11811/narain-soothfancy#comments)
---
I do really like Anime stuff and also Korean MMORPGs by their style. But WoWs comical style just doesn't fit in this anime-scenery. I actually think the Races are still fine. It lost some.. darkness I'd say with as you said Bloodelves, but also Pandas.
---
I plan on doing a female dwarf hunter, mostly because no one else will be. I will start on second day,  not first day to avoid server issues.
---
Ofcourse
---
Take as much time as I can to play early on - I want to experience that buzz. Focus pretty hard on leveling my main, but will run each dungeon at least once and level professions as I go, so won't be setting any records. And will be leveling as balance, of course.
---
YIKES WEIRDCHAMP POG
---
Mate. It has all been confirmed and tested.
---
And what you are writing is wrong.
---
At 300 skill **you need 9% hit to be capped**. Because Blizzard literally confirmed that your first 1% to hit is being ignored vs. raid bosses. Your hit cap is 9%. Your chance to miss is 8%. 1% hit has no effect.
---
At 305 skill you need 6% hit. Beyond that returns are minimal (your hit cap approaches 5% for 306-315 skill).
---
At 306-309 skill you still get benefits for glancing blows (penalty goes from 35% @ 300 down to 5% @ 308 skill).
---
Yes, the difference between 300 and 305 skill is *huge*. We are mostly being bullied out of this subreddit for pointing this out, though.
---
See that’s what I’m wondering now, i vaguely remember that.  I’m wondering if blizzard will hold true to that in classic.
---
Metzen needs to get on Cameo and do this. He'd rake in cash.
---
NOMEGALUL- dungeon leveling is going to be at least 50 hours SLOWER than questing.
---
Well, you can't train all levels of those skills with these trainers. For instance, Deneb Walker only sells books to get Expert (225) First Aid and a couple First Aid recipes.
---
It's more a matter of frequency, once every hour is fine, once every 15 minutes is not
---
all of them
---
For snacks man just get fruit, so easy to finish a bag of grapes or cherries while gaming, and they're so refreshing and tasty this time of of year
---
I used to stand in the crate, no one can get you from behind on there
---
One thing I am really looking forward to trying out is [nugrunning](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24936-NugRunningClassic.html). 
---
I have not used it yet, but seeing it in screenshots after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsx2ARJyXY), I have huge hopes (that may be wildly unrealistic). 
---
I suspect it will be less than I hope (due to classic wow limitations) but seeing your own rend durations on mobs without targeting them is only the start (nameplate dot timers). 
---
If it monitored your party member's dots, it would let you switch targets and know if the dots will finish a mob off. 
---
But even beyond that,  Imagine... it could let you keep track of your sunders without even targeting a mob (this may not be the case, for example if it pulls the mob name from the combat log, it may not be able to distinguish from multiple copies of the same mob). 
---
but even beyond that... imagine if it could allow you to keep track of EVERYONE'S sunders without targeting a mob. Stack up to 5 sunders without ever targeting a mob? that sounds great.
---
I don't want to overpromise, because I have literally never used this  addon, but the idea of nameplate dot timers REALLY interests me. These are not a thing on private servers (that I know of), but they are clearly very powerful.
---
Give your banker disenchant.  In vanilla he will be able to disenchant anything you send his way until level 60.  Then when you make an alt make that your enchanter and use all the mats your banker has accumulated.
---
I bet you also used that hairstyle with two braids, black coloured :DDD
---
Camping will be a once a week thing. A single attack by someone of equal level might happen once an hour or more, especially in highly contested zones like STV.
---
If you watch youtube video's beware of guides that tell you to use the /sit mechanic for enrage, it wont be a thing in classic
---
most people would never write 12am when the 24 hour clock is a thing and way less confusing.
---
How can you possibly enjoy the game, if you worry so much about how others play the game?
---
2. Well it's work for 1 person to help out thousands.
---
3. Yes this wouldn't be the best way to look for new upgrades, it could work though. Mostly this would be about filtering raiders
---
4. really? Because someone just quickly saying a number their addon tells you is a very fast efficient and fairly accurate way of knowing a players worth. Obviously there's countless factors but for a pug the best option has always been to find the best geared player. This is literally a number that says your gear level.
---
5. I doubt anyone would use this for dungeons, I would however use it for raid pugs.
---
6. I agree that it could be part of the fun. But some people just wants to find a decently geared members quickly. If that's not you, then look at peoples gear and let others use addons to do it.
---
Sounds like you're lazy lol  
---
Elvui when tinkered with is the best looking full UI replacement hands down, there is no comparison
---
But when you sleep the crowd will catch you!
---
Same here. :(

Thanks.
---
So wait? What’s going on in BFA now? Does like teldrassil and Darnassus just not exist anymore? I used to sit in darnassus all day. I didn’t even care that I had to hike for 30 minutes to get anywhere worth while.
---
Same, except for that first Sunday, then I'll be playing all day
---
KoSand I hope vQueue gets ported to classic
---
I've read it numerous times over the years.  
---
&gt; Not to mention "just adding spells to make them plate armor levels" would throw a lot of wrenches in pvp balance
---
No it wouldn't.  It's no different from bear form or the shadow priests armor boost in shadowform.  PvP balance lol.  Blizzard still hasn't balanced PvP in WoW, they have been trying for fifteen years.
---
So people do watch my videos then.  Thanks for clarifying that.
---
If you use a very crude way to calculate the GS then yes. But there's countless of BiS lists and Stat calculators like this for example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVcmgixKaP9LC-rrqS4D2rojIz48KwKA8QBmJloX1h7f8BkUloVuiw19eR2U5WvVT4InYgnPunUo49/pubhtml#
---
Look how he assigns all gear a value based on stats? That's what you do indivually for each class or even spec. The addon should be easily able to tell what spec you are, or you could have people enter their class and spec and when you link your GS the addon prints "Rogue Sword 325GS" or something.
---
Im not gonna power level this time, i want to enjoy the experience.  I was a late starter when the game came out and missed all the endgame content. Im going to get professions this time too. Normally i just level up as fast as possible and dont really take time to enjoy anything, but not this time.
---
You're on the internet. People will post their own views. You don't like them? Move along.
---
&gt; I'd personally prioritize 1440p over 144H 
---
That is just crazy talk to me
---
Nope, there has been no information about this. Nobody has been interested in this topic. Use the search bar and it will come up empty.
---
Retail bad
---
Classic good
---
Priest+rogue is a top tier combo. Anyone dumb enough to try to gank you better have you outnumbered.
---
My memory of Vanilla says "no".  Wasn't worth it for me until 45+ at bare minimum, and that required farming certain spots, which took time away from leveling.
---
When LFR meets Classic
---
I am going to meet up with 2 people I met on the internet 9 years ago. Will meet them for the first time in IRL and we will have a 1 week classic only lan party. Beyond excited! Gives me the REAL oldschool feeling.
---
Possibly because that was the start of this entire reply chain.......... at this point it is clear that not only do you fail to think ahead, but that you have no experience actually running dungeons at all.
---
That's part of the launch experience! Barely being able to log in, if at all, then having 1fps for 10 minutes after loading into the game took 5 times longer.
---
Yeah true. I meant to say not giving me level ups as much.

casual elitists can be jerks too.

Yeah, upgrade the ram and the storage big time, should be able to play fine on medium to lower settings.
---
My take is that the main goal is to provide something to fill content droughts for retail.

A grindy slow game version is perfect for that and it 'll take till p5 for the general audience to realize how shit the balancing is - as that's usually the time when p-servers start to die as well

Fuck lost it at metrosexual

Wah wah hit 60 in 4 years

You stand in place during PvP?
---
Addons will certainly be of great help, but even without them at first I personally think will do fine. I already know most of the quest locations and everything. The only thing that bugs me from what I've seen on streams is the map is fullscreen and has those black borders on each side.
---
All those foods seem terrible for you lol, and youll most likely carb crash multiple times over
---
Basically, no
---
going with the waybackmashine for realmpop. the pve realms were dominating and only 2 months after the pvp system came out did the PvP servers pull ahead with the population
---
Word, looks like I'm gonna be doing more routing than I think this stress test.
---
😂😂😂
---
The stress test on the 8th
---
Every class really. The set bonuses are very good, even if the individual items are weaker than non-set items.
---
DPS Warriors, tank Druids, healing Paladins / Shamans, and Shadow Priests obviously need to find off-set pieces. But the tier sets can work for those specs - at least until you find a better item.
---
Several litres of gin and tonic and a few grams of speed.
---
Very cheap and efficient, also you can lose weight while gaming which is another bonus.
---
I am NOT in Any kind of hurry
---
It has 16GBs of RAM and a 512GB SSD. I think it can handle a 5GB install fine.
---
You're looking at the WoW Classic Min Requirements.
---
\&gt;  Locks 500/800, one of our locks was shadow bolting rats to get higher on the meters so hard to tell what he was really doing. 
---
Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do in world of metercraft.

That is way to fucking fast, slow down you moppet.
---
I remember in vanilla on my gnome I was in the hinterlands and some Tauren was trying to kill me, I hid behind a rock near the entrance of a cave and he couldn’t find me, so he gave up and left. It was awesome.
---
No I’m pretty sure they crush Tauren into flour there
---
You read my comment numerous times over the years? 
---
Shaman wasn't meant to be a tank post sunken temple. The guy who designed it said so.
---
And wtf are you going on about it's no different than bear form... Imagine an enhancement shaman with all that armor. Bears don't do the damage shaman does. 
---
You're just dumb and I'm done with ya. Peace kid.
---
Thorium brotherhood gear isn’t needed to kill rag.
---
Sulfuras is an edge case.
---
Of much greater importance is the PvP gear. There were actually 3 sets of PvP gear. The epic set, the level 60 blue and the level 58 blue.
---
The level 58 and 60 sets are different item ids. The epic set, retained its id and buffed itself. 
---
BlIzzard has said items will release in their end state, and items will release according to when they were added.
---
Based on that logic, we should see both blue sets, 58 and 60 with the latter blue set released (I believe) with aq. 
---
These items will have a much more dramatic effect on much more o&amp; the server than TB fire res gear or sulfuras will.
---
Looking forward to it.
---
The price premium on a 17.3'' isn't worth it imo.

Unless you meme into having 2/3rds+ of your screen covered in add-on UI you'll be fine w/ a normal 15.6''.

Good profession choices. 
---
They match really nicely with a hunter.
---
I'd recommend lvling skinning and herbalism at the same time then dropping skinning for your alchemy once you hit max level. My plan anyway!
---
Yeah I think most of these simplistic bases of an idea have been mentioned already.
---
Will it be done in game or can I do from the website?
---
Hunter or Warlock.
---
Mage is good for AoE grinding, but Hunter/Warlock have no downtime.
---
depends on your goals, i fully expect to be running hundreds upon hundreds of high lvl 5 mans tanking for my guildies, so enchanting is extremely worth it for me so we can get shards, making those runs still profitable.

I like the immersion of a pet class. Are warlocks any good for the 60 grind? Gear dependant?
---
Eye of Kilrogg is still on retail
---
Been on the fence about a second account. Lock summons, gathering as I wait, mage ports. It seems reaaaaaaaly worty it for a measly $15 a month
---
Unless you're good enough that fighting other players is as easy as fighting boars, that's not an argument.
---
You need a few additional addons too:  
---
1. an addon that gives you achievements for the most meaningless things and you can keep track of them and feel good about yourself
---
2. an addon that gives you 3 stars when you do something meaningless like in those mobile games
---
Haha well, maybe ;)
---
Do Tauren and NE druids have different models/textures for their shapeshift forms?
---
learn to pick locks as you level up, open lockboxes for tips=free money
---
We dont know, but I would assume you log in
---
https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development
---
Locks are probably top 3 leveling class with Hunter and Mages. They are a great all around class. 
---
I'd still do the skinning even just to vendor and sell the leather and pick up your alchemy at 60.
---
Note down their names and spread the word.
---
This is a waste of time. You're a moron.
---
Paladins are decent 5man tanks. This does not make them viable. End of story.
---
Honestly, I love that bit too. It brings life to the economy, and gold actually becomes a real resource. I remember back in retail WoW; gold for people who knew how to play the AH just became useless for any other purpose than to trade for real life currency.
---
I can see the issue with being able to equip items that you don't deserve, but that could easily be fixed by putting a requirement on having to beat the boss that correlates with the item in order to equip it.
---
I know it's 100% not going to happen (because it's Blizzard), I just think it'd be a great idea that could bring PvPers back.
---
Oh man, I recently leveled a nelf mage on retail and remember a time when I misclicked time warp and got stuck in a house for the duration because it made my character model too big to fit through the door lol
---
So version 1.12, or version 1.13 or either works?
---
Hunter...
---
Are there any videos of people doing this? I was seeing how fast I could level a troll mage and I wasn't even close to those times, so either I suck, Durotar sucks or I am missing some important tricks.
---
They can solo elites... big whoop - go hunter
---
Honestly he cannot say “you won’t get camped” because it’s super situational. Escpecially in some zones like stv. That said people are right in that as a rogue priest combo you’re more then likely to be the ones doing the camping and not the ones being camped. Someone approaching a rogue priest duo would either have to vastly outlevel you, vastly outnumber you (you could very likely 2vs3 a lot of people depending on who), or be completely stupid. 
---
Just do the PvP server. They’re overall more fun. And essentially everyone I know who joined a plain pve server back in vanilla almost always regretted it.
---
Sorry— they’re not level 60 (more like 50), but they still grant xp (and thus, soul shards) 
---
They have just over 2k hp, and are also found by Raven Hill in Duskwood
---
Just started and already longing for classic. I like you mate, see you august 28th’!
---
Depends on the class, a lot of classes work fine without gear, some don't.
---
Rogues in duels can do fine with bits and bobs from out in the world because their kit/CDs allow for them to be powerful in a 1v1 scenario.
---
Same for Frost Mages.
---
Same for Warlocks, mostly.
---
There is a working version for nilla ps as well called pfUI
---
It wont. Author is not updating it.
---
Yes. The Tauren bear has horns, cat is a lion with horns, etc.
---
Southshore for alliance sells black label rumsey rum, I believe. That's handy.
---
You wasted probably 60 seconds to post this. Just wanted to let you know.
---
It's really good if I recall. I don't know exactly
---
ClassicLFG is already available and has all the features of vQueue and more!
---
Poggers, while mouth breathers argue over which addons to use and if dungeons are fast leveling (omegalul) - you were out here killing this guide shit... thanks a lot papa!
---
Fair enough, my expeirence with premades has been very rigid in who they take. Druids will 100% have a spot for flag carrying tho always
---
So you confess that you want it to weed people out.
---
However early on in leveling most players wont bother fighting the enemy faction as stopping to kill someone and potentially lose the fight is more time wasted as the mass of behind the bottleneck players is coming for you.
---
Depends on the updates, but so far, my list is;
---
Questie, ElvUi, DetailsDamageMeter, EMA, Clique, FasterLooting, Aux, AtlasLoot, DBM, FieldGuide, Leatrix.
---
Can you shoot a wand while casting? If not do mages ever need a wand unless oom?
---
Right, and you have about 20% dislike ratio. Which brings me back to my initial point. Not everyone who watches you, likes you. Some people just like to follow up on their favorite out-of-touch-with-reality YouTuber. You are extremely delusional.
---
Ok, replace boars with dungeons then. Most people wouldn't enjoy running dungeons being the end game either.
---
Hell yes!
---
Illidan or any high pop server, source that was my server for Horde, I was forced to play my Alliance toons since Illidan was down
---
On launch day I will have some nice chats with other players about how happy we are because of classic...while staring at tagged mobs. Exactly what happened on stress test. People just having a good time with this game. Love it
---
Conveniently I have 2 days off after launch day which I will spend accordingly!
---
I absolutely cannot sit still all day though so I'll be keeping my gym/running routine, makes me enjoy sitting down with the game that much more as well.
---
It's winter where I am (NZ) so I'll probably be drinking copious amounts of tea and get proper cozy!
---
can you get in on the 8th without a subscription?
---
Haha, that's so funny. I met him at Disneyland a couple years ago as well. We were both at the fried chicken joint and he walked up beside me to get food and I just blurted out "FOR THE HORDE!" and he laughed and clapped me on the back.
---
All I know from that is we need LOTS of Rockstar Energy.
---
Sadly they've changed the flavour in the UK but goddamn it's the drink of champions and fat dudes raiding goldshire. 100% worth.
---
thx
---
Thanks a lot for all the work and thought that's gone into this. Exactly what I've been looking for!
---
I did have one question though... The end of the guide mentions that you did a test to see if I could do the run with just white and grey items, and it took about twice as long, with 4 days /played. But from looking at a few different weapon progression guides for rogues, it seems that you can’t obtain any worthwhile green or blue weapons without doing long quest chains that would likely require grouping. Which means obtaining one of these items would take a lot of time away from the grind. 
---
My question is where were you getting your greens from if you weren’t questing for them? Are they random drops? Are you hitting up the Auction House every so often? If yes, which quests would you specifically recommend for weapon progression? Or at what junctures would you recommend purchasing an upgrade from the Auction House?
---
You gotta do what you gotta do in world of metercraft.
---
I hope LazyPig gets ported, that's the main one I want lol. I'll also run AtlasLoot, some version of damage and threat meters. Hopefully Details! has a classic version
---
Just be like John, no problems until she comes back. Then just get the dog and done.
---
&gt; what caused all the water? climate change?
---
The passage out to the ocean wasn't there. The bay area was a salt flat and raceway.
---
Yes, 100% i have been pushing trolls for pservers on another reddit page for a long time. Even at the start of an E***** people pushed back really hard against them. 
---
It 100% was popular / trusted people telling the community at large that Trolls are good, that changed the wider perception. (Pservers for sure kept increasing the acceptance of trolls slowly.)
---
And sure this could occur with enh (even a resto) dedicating a good amount of their time to twisting. 
---
PS- i wanna play priest, but the power of Resto shamans really makes me consider otherwise (i just hate shaman leveling).
---
He’s clearly trolling.
---
I've had plenty of chances to AoE grind on 10k pop private servers even when the server was fresh to a month old. There are places where it's out of the way and doable.
---
Lmao this is spot on
---
2/10
---
I don’t really remember dps/heals running fire resist. We may have had a piece or two on our first down of rag but then after that mostly just said fuck it and wore whatever + used buffs. 
---
If you don’t already know this, then you need to make sure you have a skinner to skin onyxia. Because nefarion uses a move that auto kills your entire raid unless your entire raid is arbitrarily wearing a cloak made of onyxias scales that you need to make for 40+ people that protects you from his shadowflame ability. I think the drake triplets use that move on your tank too. 
---
Tanks maxed their resistance basically if I recall right. So they got 315 resistance and then just do whatever.
---
Aq40 was a little more complicated. I forget what we did regarding resistance for viscidius (or if we even used it. I’m almost sure that was a boss that required some nature resistance) huhuran you definitely needed I think like 15ish people with NR gear who were soaking up damage. 
---
I never did sapphiron cause my guild couldn’t kill the 4 horsemen and then eventually we all just said fuck it when tbc was announced and farmed gear to fuck around in battlegrounds. But I do recall hearing you need frost resistance for him. 
---
As far as class requirements that’s gonna depend on whether your horde or alliance. But for the most part we had 1 healer per group, so 8ish healers. Sometimes more or less depending on raid attendance. But majority of the time was 8. Our guild had 4-5 dedicated tanks (1/4 was a feral Druid) and then our dps warriors all had a bootleg tank set if needed. We didn’t always use all of them. In the case of the 4 horsemen encounter your best bet is to find warriors in other guilds and offer them pics of your moms nudes and irl money to gquit their guild and join yours so you can more quickly gear them up and have a chance to down the encounter.
---
Try not to overthink the early stuff. A bunch of drunk chimpanzees could very much clear ony / Mc / bwl. Just make sure you get 40-55 reliable people together that are able to cooperate long term and not cause a lot of drama. If your making a guild ensure your main tank is either a GM, BFF’s with the GM, or otherwise interview that bitch like you’re giving him top secret NSA clearance. Because it’s a total bitch when you invest heavily in a dude and he bounces at 3am when only 4 people are logged in to see him gquit.
---
Pogchampion
---
It will be done in game. It’s not just name reservation, it’s full character creation: server, race/class, looks, and name. You just won’t be able to enter the game after you make the character(s).
---
Some sexy UI (probably ElvUi) and...that's probably it, possibly threat and damage meters too.  
---
Absolutely no quest related addons, used to level with Joana's guide on private servers so this time imma do it the way it was meant to be.
---
Huge thank you to Minorou for letting me use his Dungeon Lore Compendium!

It's really not hard to kill the fresh mob lol, unless you've already burned your mana gem/potion.

What faction is the vendor? If hes a goblin faction u can put them on ”at war”, kill him and wait for respawn. Not sure if his desth refreshes his stock items. Either way then u can time his death and time when hes alive and talk to him asap.
---
Poggers
---
This is a mindset that is common overall in this age of MMOs and strongly encouraged by all developers. 
---
People have long forgotten that it is OK to be behind others and have instead attempted to insult people who wish to push to the front with extreme amounts of playtime or play most efficiently with what time they have. 
---
I mean if you cannot accomplish what others are doing why not just insult it and pretend you are not jealous?
---
Advantages or disadvantages, I love gnomes and will always be 'em if I can. That or dorf.
---
I recommend the Naga Hex v2, it's more on the pricey side but I'm so in love with the side button layout I don't think I could use another mouse. I know it's for MOBAs and WoW has way more hot key buttons but I had the Official WoW mouse and I honestly could only reliably memorize the first 2 rows of abilities. With the Naga Hex v2 you can tell very easily where the spells are just by thumb position but a $150 price tag might not be what your looking for.
---
&gt;It turns out, you can be pretty prepared
---
How could you possibly know that?
---
Yuuup
---
&gt;Yes they are decent, when speced, while warrior better overall regardless of spec and is exceptional fully speced...... 
---
Nope. Prot paladins do a better job of aoetanking dungeons like Strath UD or Scholo. I say this as a warrior main that has had a paladin alt. Not having to worry about aoethreat is simply a godsent in those cases.
---
&gt;pld is the worst tank
---
By far.
---
&gt;no multitask ability in this role. 
---
They can heal okayish with a gear swap. But then again, all paladins can, even 0/0/0 ones.
---
&gt;Choosing to tank anything other than leveling 5 mans is a moronic path especially if you plan to be doing any early raiding while tanking dungeons to get geared.  
---
Yep.
---
&gt;All you manage to do is make posts without standing behind anything you say, because what you say is bullshit fluff that has little to no practical value.
---
All **you** manage to do is completely ignore anything I say or OP asks about, and insert your pointless strawman idea of paladin raid tanking. What **you** say is pointless fluff; your initial argument of private server bugs was never revisited and you generally refuse to come with any reasons for your mindless blabbering that attempts to be an argument.
---
I don't know why people like you act like this. Hybrids in vanilla have several glaring issues that prevent them from being relevant in pure roles, but it is worthwhile to point those issues out and examine why they are a dealbreaker (e.g. paladin taunt/gear or ele shaman resists or mana). Going "PROTADIN BAD REEEEEEEE" and arguing against the strawman of protadin maintanks (which no one but the truly insane believe in) is pointless.
---
So frost bolt then wand to death? Thanks!
---
And T2 pally is one of the best looking sets.  If you had that set, you'd be crazy not to wear it.
---
fucking loser lol
---
Haha for sure. Orcish for lol if my memory serves me well?
---
I was always an alliance man back in the day but all my friends are going horde now, having very mixed feelings regarding this.
---
Nice! Looking through it now.  
---
Unless it's not mentioned they'll need to add auto dismounting (unless Classic does that by default for things like taking a flight path), and auto rolling for ZG coins and stuff, otherwise it looks like it does all LP did and more. I'll try to send him some feedback now
---
I should have said, it is not working yet. Witch is of course basically the same as not updated. But there is a chance it will work the 27th, but I'll rather have addons that already work in the beta, ready for action.
---
PicardFacepalm.jpg
---
That makes no sense. Different fall damage depending on mass on the other hand is more realistic.
---
Resilience made it so you had to do arena and battlegrounds in order to be good at PvP. For those of us that raided full time and enjoyed PvP as a secondary activity, it killed the game for us.
---
Well if you don't get offended, I guess you're right; why should anyone ever get offended? Wow you totally opened my mind here

I plan to wait a few days until the hype dies down and level without so much competition for mobs.
---
Chipotle, maybe.  Possibly Culvers if I feel like a good burger.
---
Oooooooh, *launch*
---
Sure it does.  They aren't in a vacuum.  Air resistance does play a part in how fast something falls.
---
In all honesty, they probably want to see a smooth launch instead of driving a ton of extra people to it. If its successful and they see sub numbers bump due to it, they'd probably advertise it.
---
In all honesty though, the vast majority of people who want to play Classic likely already know about it. People who play current WoW, and people who played vanilla WoW are likely going to be the main player bases. Sure there are people out there who quit playing as life moved on, but unlike this subreddit sometimes seems to indicate, not everyone is planning to drop everything in life and play Classic WoW like a 14 year old again.
---
Large bril shards averaged like 4gs on u-know-what server. So it boosts ur gold if ur unlucky with boss loot and get lets say blue cloth item from tribute chest that sells for 1 1/2g to vendor
---
That's fair, but it's dangerous to make anything even close to an excuse for that behavior, in my opinion.
---
Why would you think Blizzard control what you can and cannot do with your computer?
---
That's either a joke or a quote. 
---
The pain and effort of that really isn't required. Your password wont be hacked unless it's phished off you or it's leaked, just throw in a few special characters and a number or two and that's it. Job done.
---
Its not the cost and its not if you are willing to do this. its the 10s of precentage of raiders who aren't willing to do this that means pvp bgs will dry up much faster than they would otherwise.
---
Its clear that MANY people here have no clue how BGs get sparse after a bit as people don't want to pay 100g+ and maybe re weapon skilling just to be effective in pvp.
---
Its about getting more people into pvp without effecting vanilla. (IE don't allow people to switch specs for different bosses or even raids.)
---
Thus a really long CD on switch specs would allow this. 
---
Still 1000g is 10 weeks of switching from pve to pvp and back ... which isn't that bad.

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bigdebuffs
---
Yes it is, thank you.
---
It worked for me in the Beta...
---
BFA reuses a lot of the Legion systems without the Legion reward or progression structure.
---
For example world quests with your reward box were meaningful as a potential source for legendary items that allowed you to alter your playstyle in different aspects of the game when you used them or as power source to feed to weapon upgrade system
---
BFA still has the system - but the big reward is not there anymore so people don't see them for anything other than gated rep progression
---
another aspect is the leveling to the new level cap. You got weaker and weaker while leveling with more and more of your tools breaking down. They didn't even add a new max lvl talent choice to spice things up. Only the warmode option to use the pvp talents you already had before. (WoD was the last time they've added a talent row - but legion got away with it due to the artifact weapon giving you one or two new skills and spec enhancing benefits to unlock)
---
Speaking of the artifact weapon. It is an easy to understand system that has people with little milestones whenever they got another power level unlocked. Similar to the satisfaction of the talent trees in the earlier game versions. While the hardcore raiders complained about 'the need to grind 24/7' it hardly phased the general audience - aside from the parrots who were just repeating their fav. streamer's rants'
---
BFA even tried to continue the concept of 'taking power away from you' on max lvl - while it was necessary to some extent to break that system down as a part of the progression to BFA as the Legion power level of the specs was way to high - I never understood why the azerite armor system took its silly procs away from you when you got a higher version of those items(it took them way too long to address that). It ain't fun when you have 'better gear' in your inventory - but you can't use it because you are lacking X azerite power levels to get the same benefits as the lower lvl version of it.
---
Well and the final nail to the coffin was the island system. Which was a good idea, but with those weak rewards as only goal to work towards the frustration was inevitable to crop up the way it did.
---
hit and expertise =&gt; directly related to reforging and a wide selection of sockets to adjust your gear to fit your playstyle/needs (wotlk both, tbc only sockets)
---
sets tuned to support the classes for the respective raid tier instead of generic random dmg procs
---
heroic dungeons that actually encourage CC - not because of the lack of AoE abilities (classic) - but because stuff was actually dangerous (TBC)
---
getting rep on your own terms (TBC) or by picking the daily quests of the faction you want to progress with (TBC/TBC) - or grinding dungeons with the respective tabard (Wotlk) instead of a random selection of world quests every 6 hours that are a mixture of recycled quests and exploration aspects that may not even allow you to progress with the faction you want to progress (BFA) 
---
crafted gear that was BiS and stayed relevant with upgrades throughout multiple raid releases for all classes (TBC) (partway WOTLK)
---
a working economy that's not dominated by 'reskin transmogs and old recipes for completionists' (TBC/WOTLK)
---
a reason to farm world content (TBC rep grind, crafting recipes TBC/WOTLK) limited resource spawns to encourage conflict (TBC/WOTLK)
---
benefits for having any of the available profession for raid and pvp(TBC and even more during WOTLK) and not just alchemy potion/flask usage
---
gear staying relevant once you've earned it and it still being useful into the next big patch instead of getting instantly replaced by the next RNG drop
---
to parrot, class design with a wide selection of toolkits and the talent trees to once again also support playstyles outside of PvE raid focused or PvP arena focused specs
---
no sharding (layering in WOTLK, but eventually most people ended up in the final layer)
---
no titanforging
---
no azerite armor with 1000 nameless generic damage or heal/shield procs
---
is there VanillaGuide port to classic?  I'm used to it from pservers (tho i can do 90% of the leveling from memory at this point :P )
---
I'm going to be the most generous player on my server. In the month or two it will take me to get to 60 I plan to give out multiple N-word passes along the way for my fellow travelers! No buffs though because they cost too much mana for my class.
---
https://github.com/ForgetfulScarab/dashingDismount or you can use a macro to dismount.
---
I don't think we will see any addons for ZG coins anytime soon, unless one of the DKP addons have integrated it.
---
But pservers have a faster respawn rate and higher mob density. If you played you know how insanely different it is. 
---
They almost respawn instantly. When you enter a cavern they literally spawn behind you.
---
If they had wings we might agree but the air resistance is negligible when comparing these two.
---
That's true, but they're also dead.
---
I had my original password for years until a few years ago.  I got an email from Blizzard saying that there was an unauthorized login or something and I needed to change my password.  I went to Blizzard’s official website and changed it from there.
---
Now that I think about it that email was probably just a phishing attempt.
---
In the "current" phase it is gone. But you have to do a questions to get it that way. It's still there for low level and new toons. After the quest line you can switch phases as well if you want to go there.
---
Why? Rogue is slow to level and classic will be the patch where they got nerfed really hard.

I don’t have retail installed, that’s why I’m like wow this download seems short
---
So far the information we have is at the beginning there will be no transfer services. They also said that they might implement services which were available in vanilla later down the line. The source is a interview with Ion, should have been around May.
---
Nobody on Earth is capable of predicting how the warcraft population would have been different expansion 2 expansion if blizzard had made different choices. Nobody can do that. We do know if it wasn't still profitable it wouldn't be running.

Exactly, enjoy what you want to do. But I have seen many people feeling pressured to play a way that they don’t want to play the game, and those people will end up hating classic. Quite a few of us are trying to steer them away from that mindset and reminding them that you can play how ever you want and have a good time, that’s what vanilla was all about.
---
Hopefully all the people who are leveled by then aren't just out ganking
---
Lol if they go to TBC and force everyone to move to TBC - I'll never play wow again :) enjoy leveling in hellfire peninsula!
---
Well I have at least hear of some sort of boost in the Battle for Azeroth version of the game? I’m not sure if that’s correct but will that be in the game? Seems unrealistic for everyone to need to replay a game they already have.

lol another delusional player that never played Classic. You will be camped EVERYWHERE. Being attacked by someone you level might happen once per WEEK. It doesn't matter what zone youre in. You will log out and come back in an hour and guess what? That asshole will STILL BE THERE.

Add all the things to my screen
---
4weird... classic isn't a large game.
---
Part of the fun of playing classic or vanilla the first time is just wandering around and figuring stuff out for yourself. The game will give you some pointers on what to do, but for the most part you have to read the quest texts, look at the map, &amp; wander around until you find what you're looking for.
---
Don't be too concerned with doing things efficiently or correctly. 
---
Just figure it out for yourself. Don't be afraid to ask for help in chat.
---
Make mistakes, make friends and enjoy it. 
---
Of course when you're ready there's a thousand and one guides on YouTube for every facet of the game.
---
Probably.
---
The comparison works better looking at wow circa cataclysm vs bfa. Vanilla and BC rotations were basic as fuck.
---
Love how it's mobile friendly with tick boxes! I plan on playing classic on my sofa on the big 4k TV with my lap board and mouse, so won't have a 2nd screen for a guide. The fact I can have my phone or tablet with the guide is awesome
---
You could just order food instead of blowing the lids off your toilet.
---
Servants in blasted lands have infinite health(quest mob that you need to do some shit on). you need the mob to give exp to get weapon skill from it. Once you get around 250 you can just do dungeon for the rest. You should pretty much get level per swing on 1-250 on those mobs, get a int buff at the end and use a fast weapon and any ability that counts as an attack, hamstring or sinister strike for example.
---
I spent 3 weeks going to school and coming back to spend my afternoons killing skeletons. 
---
Skeletons. I'd usually either stand in Stormwind or goldshire but when I finally decided to go for it, i'd level by killing fucking skeletons.

I never wanna go back man. Obviously I was disabled not questing but holy shit was it painful. People genuinely musn't remember how hard it was levelling back in the day :(

&gt;In pve it doesn't really matter, some argue troll for berserking but people from private server who raid will tell you that it does not matter at all. As for pvp it would be orc, but again choose what you like best, you gonna play and look at the character for a long time, don't choose a race over a minuscule advantage.
---
/r/Gaming4Gamers has good recommendations
---
Shot of whiskey then blow a big ol honkin gator tail of cocaine.
---
And if you want to afk/tab-out a bit Hunter wins the tiebreaker since you don't actually have to press anything to finish the mob. I love warlocks but they spam spells every GCD to be efficient :D
---
You weren't able to port your characters in OSRS.
---
Because I think it's the most aesthetically acceptable race in Classic. 
---
If this was TBC, I'd be playing a blood elf.
---
2 weeks paid time off work, an ounce of some good weed, plenty of energy drinks and food.
---
Well, if the ElvUI UIs from retail don't work, then I'm sure there will be a ton made for classic on release. I vaguely remember seeing some streamer using ElvUI during the beta that was playing rogue, and he had a really nice ElvUI setup. I'll edit post if I remember the streamed, but they were a gnome rogue.
---
&gt;Playing with your friend will remove 90% of the ganking you would encounter.
---
Nope. Why would a level 60 be scared of your low level partner?
---
If they don’t re-release the old school commercials they are missing out on prime time players! Had a friend just last week who had no clue it was coming back, and so soon!
---
They've pretty much confirmed that the first priority of classic is to preserve Vanilla as a sort of museum piece - if we do get TBC, Classic will remain.
---
That being said, many people will jump ship to TBC then so it'll be tough for blizz to choose what to do once Naxx rolls out
---
As a paladin you will have to play Healer at 60 (for raiding). But most of your BiS items will be cloth and leather, not plate. So as a Paladin expect to wear a robe... in that case, since you like plate armor, warrior is your best choice.
---
Again, all that is for raids... if you just wanna enjoy casual leveling and do some 5-man dungeons at 60 and some pvp, paladin is very good! Tanking dungeons with paladin is more fun than with warrior imo and easier..
---
And now we get to see if all those people were true to their word or full of shit about wanting to pay to play vanilla. Let's see how many don't play because it's not pirated
---
Wait 3 days to get ganked everywhere, or wait a couple hours and be just behind the wave. Hmm
---
If they ever add anything onto classic they will need to do it on separate servers. If they add classic+ servers just to try things out that would be cool, or if they added TBC servers that would be cool too, but what they need to do for sure is leave classic intact or else we'll just be back at this place with people asking for vanilla wow servers again.
---
So just like on live rofl
---
Hemo eats a debuff slot though, no?
---
The int increase is really minor and makes a lot less difference than any other usual "must have" racial. The reputation gain with humans can however save you a lot of money/time.
---
Earth defense force 4.1 or 5 is what I have been playing. Looks terrible but is challenging and fun.
---
Return of the Obra Dinn
---
Won't remind you of Classic and make you tear up because 27th is too far away! ;)
---
try commenting on a game youve actually played. Its obvious you never played vanilla wow.
---
kid, you really need to broaden your vocabulary...

Play the game
---
Same boat.  Friend of mine told me about it maybe 2 weeks ago.  We haven't played since wotlk.  Never knew private servers were a thing.  Have watched plenty of videos on every topic in that 2 weeks though.  Didn't even know I've been waiting for this for a decade.  Glad I only knew about it for the last month of waiting.
---
Wrath we kind of slowed down a little before both of us quitting.  Og vanilla never did any raiding took a break and came back as bc came out so only experienced naxx either way over leveled or as the re-release 10/25? man.  Bc was excellent though and muru(sp?) in sunwell I remember being the wall my guild ran into at the end.  Really hoping vanilla continues on to at least tbc but with more time at the top end for naxx.
---
Either way super excited all over again.  I have more work engagements so won't have unlimited time but I easily see life becoming sleep, work wow for the foreseeable future.  See you out there
---
Druid, Hunter, Warlock, Mage are all good, if you're making a character for it specifically. 
---
If you're using it as an Herb/Alch bot, definitely Druid, I'd say. Shapeshifted Herbalism is no joke.
---
Interesting, thank you for your input. Warrior may be back on the table for me
---
Sadly I will only be able to play for a day and then I have to fly out of town for a week...
---
Hearts of Iron IV, Heroes of the Storm, Blitzkrieg 3, The Witcher 3.
---
Going RP and/or PvE seems to be the safest bet.
---
Fury's straight up worse than Arms, and considering how bad warrior leveling is already until 30-40, I'd highly recommend most people to either spec 5 points into cruelty and then spec Arms until 30 to then rescpec full Arms once, or just go Arms from the getgo.
---
That being said, if you *want* to go Fury, go right ahead. People leveled resto/Holy to 60 back in the day, it's preference afterall, but the whole /sit thing to force crits won't work in Classic, it's a Pserver bug.
---
I checked, but I couldn't find anything from your link. I may be wrong about that part though.
---
For older games im playing at the minute it actually looks really good haha
---
The point of the sentences is to get the length in an easy to remember/type way.  You calling them insecure is wrong the length is what makes them secure.  The fact that 20 random numbers lethers and symbols is more secure than a sentence that's 20 chars long doesn't make the sentence not secure and it's far more secure than a 9 digit password of any kind.
---
Like you said. They were sustaining but as far as damage goes you’ll get beat by almost everything. Can’t comment on spriest tho
---
Snacks I'm going with Walmart brand [Great Value Delux Mixed Nuts](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Deluxe-Mixed-Nuts-15-25-Oz/857686977) these are really good and decent price and most importantly nonmessy, also I'm going with [Old Trapper Beef Jerky](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Old-Trapper-Old-Fashioned-Beef-Jerky-10-Oz/46460951) again nonmessy and protein to stay feeling full and energy, plus I'm a beff jerky fanatic, I even make my own sometimes.

Drinks I'm sticking with tried and true [Monster Zeros](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Monster-Absolutely-Zero-Energy-Drink-16-Fl-Oz/15935196) I like the purple but the red or whites ain't bad. Now launch day I'll be forgoing the Energy Drink route and will instead be making a pitcher of WoW South Island Iced Tea from the World of Warcraft Cookbook and will be thoroughly sloshed in Iron Forge within a few hours of launch embarrassing myself in Trade Chat.
---
Good info for new players. But rockbiter is boring and OP wants fun.
---
Started with a dwarf paladin, was asked to ress in Gnomeragan, searched franticly true my spellbook to learn I had skipped the quest to learn it, I was so mad I Rerolled to Tauren warrior , went to 60, rank 10 and and wiping for hours , days , weeks and months in MC as Maintank, to finally reroll Nelf druid. Healing my way true ZG, MC, BWL , AQ40 finally stopped progression on 4 horsemen in Naxx , then tbc and all the expansions later , I was 14 when it all started , 14 years later im going back for round 2.
---
okay, thank you for clearing this up for me :)
---
"Many people" would love to see that if we get to that point.
---
Tbc sucks balls - only good parts were dungeon difficulty and rep grinding.
---
Doing quests
---
Sorry Rogue, that Agility piece is pre-bis for tanking! &gt;:)
---
Besides desperate prayer, was is the other priest racial?
---
Here is a horde mage leveling guide: https://youtu.be/M5RN807ATAQ
---
It will also work for alliance past 22 but some spots favor horde
---
Joana has efficient routing, and is a very experienced leveler, but he doesn't min-max on anywhere near the same level as the top guys from pservers.
---
I mean just compare Joana's recent 1-12 to someone like Monkeynews (who isn't even known for being a fast leveler) - there's a massive gap in playstyle when it comes to things likes strafekiting.
---
You have 3 weeks, aim for walking each day.
---
You'll feel better.
---
Inspired by the Blood Bowl Elf team Metrosexual Menace!
---
Didnt know its that huge tho. thanks for the explanation
---
The rogue can auto run into the wall, thus moving, thus extending his attack range, thus hitting the gnome in front of him
---
Witcher 3 &amp; Divinity Original Sin 2 are both RPG's of different styles that I've played recently. Both really good games with cool stories. Either of them should keep you occupied for a while.
---
I was expecting WC3 reforged to hold us over. But I've been playing different Auto Chess games. Currently TFT the most.
---
Shadow priest is literally 4 buttons - do you want to use 4 buttons for 1000 hours?
---
I don't like druids but if it's between the two... I'm going druid 100% of the time so I don't but my head through a wall after I cast mind blast for the 53435th time.
---
Don't base any class picking decisions on their leveling experience unless you consider the leveling experience to be a huge part of the game.
---
RDR2?
---
I put a lot of effort into the design and features so it means a lot when someone responds positively to it. Glad it will work for you!
---
That's a pretty all-or-nothing way to look at it. I did two characters to 60 in vanilla, Classic launch won't be my first time through this content and it won't be my last. There will be plenty of time to stop and smell the roses again later, but those first few months of doing end-game 5 and 10 mans before the more casual players even reach 60 will be an irreplaceable experience. Even though I'm not going to plan every last experience point and not sleep for a week, I'm still going to play a lot and try not to waste *too* much time, because I want in on that.
---
Your dad is awesome. Hope I can have the same chance with a little kidda one day, it's good to know how impactful certain memories are even small silly ones like this.
---
Thanks for that :)
---
i've seen twinks do it on the beta yes and i have no sheet of their exp averages. And this would never be done by fast levelers like hunters, this is a tactic for healers and melee dps.
---
Osrs did not transfer characters over, you had to start over. I don't know where you got that info from.
---
Monster hunter world it is for me
---
Surely hunter would be slower than warriors pre-10?
---
Orc warriors are pretty damn strong early-game.
---
Well not everyone plays a lot of FPS games.
---
It's very new player friendly since it won't advise to take harder to complete quests which can lead to frustration. It can be an advantage on a fresh server to follow an alternative, slightly slower route because of the large amount of players.
---
What's your route?
---
If you don't have one memorized, you probably won't break 2 hours.

So much dispel...
---
It looks like a different game imo.
---
I have an Alienware aw3418dw with an i6 5820k and a gtx 1080 and I never dip below 100
---
you have to open Wow.exe from your Classic FOLDER
---
Right lol I played osrs on launch day, we all had to start over and nobody complained about it either, everyone was more than happy to, just like we are for classic.
---
most of the xp comes from kills... and you will get less xp per kill than solo, while you will complete quests faster. But quests are finite.. You need to some dungeons too, I would recommend do each dungeon at least once. Otherwise, you will have problem around 43-47.
---
All the people downvoting are going to be in for a rude awakening
---
Who knows. But they are the same people who want to ban quest helping addons even though they were in vanilla. And their reason is always "i want to enjoy the game and have fun slowly and read the quests". They dont seem to comprehend that they can just not get those addons themselves and let others play how they like.
---
I admire your commitment
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Leveling doesn’t matter if the endgame is your goal - pick for the endgame!
---
What do people tend to go? I plan to raid resto but honestly can’t figure out of mana tide was really all that great or not.
---
It says on the minimum requirements for WoW Classic that you must have 5 gigs available to play the game. I guess the last 1gb is for patching and whatnot.
---
This discussion is for /r/classicwowplus
---
This is pretty much my plan as well. 5% crit is too juicy to pass up.
---
Why wouldn’t it work if all the pages were stored locally?
---
If you are using the twitch client, is there a way to specify classic as the version? I could only figure out how to do so from the web browser.
---
Levelled in retail vanilla and every relevant private server since, but try again.
---
Might be worth looking at the tier sets to see what looks best e.g. I think black looks amazing with Shaman Tier 3.
---
It is a goblin.
---
It seems like a lot of people like to make this point in the same snarky way you did. Yet I've never seen any of you offer a counter to the many reasons why having everyone need on BOE's reduces ninjas/misunderstandings/other unfair outcomes.
---
Looks like you perform some type of jujitsu with your fingers whenever you cast all your dots on the target
---
Lol ok.
---
You dont know what you are talking about then. Anyone can do it if you have aoe. 3 mages, a lock and any healer can do it even faster than a melee group. Even in greens.
---

Just don't be like Kevin...

And that’s why I’ll be rolling a level 1 Gnome mage!
---
According to most polls there are more people that consider TBC their favorite expansion than vanilla. I'm not trying to argue what is better or worse, but saying that people don't like TBC is just factually incorrect.
---
Please stop
---
Meal prep chicken / veggies / rice and drink water / black coffee.
---
Truth!
---
People need to stop comparing private servers to non private servers.
---
Those are more dedicated players. That's a small number to the rest of the people. Also private servers wernt always completely the same as the original and some content was easier because of it.
---
Do you like running the flag in wsg?
---
Do you like melting face? They can beat any class 1v1 if you care about solo encounters. 
---
Both classes will be pressured into healing,  while druid will have the benefit of tanking also. 
---
Druids can stealth and travel form leveling if you're rushing to end game. Are you?
---
Is doing both feasible?
---
Anyone else find themselves a 'melee' or 'ranged' player? Conceptually mage or warlock seems really cool to me but when I play one its always some combination of annoying and boring.
---
&gt; Anyway, do you know what led to your feelings about BFA right now? All the years you chose to put into this game. It's called burn out, happens to everyone.
---
Wtf? Way to just project your thoughts onto me even though they dont relate to me at all.
---
I hate BFA because its so different from the game I grew up playing.  I'm not burned out on WoW whatsoever, in fact I'm craving the game I just fucking hate the current state of it, its not related to burnout what so ever.
---
Stop projecting your thoughts onto strangers.
---
Play both.

Spooky

No res and sub par heals.

Still can be fun.
---
&gt; My understanding of leashing is that if you run away from a mob, without damaging it, it will turn back and run home, and if you run away from a mob while continuing to damge it, it will not.

That is how it works.

---
I think if they did TBC they wouldn't force vanilla players to switch over, it'd be like a copy character to a TBC realm or something that way people who want to play exclusively vanilla could still do so.
---
As for changes that the community wants.  I think blizzard should certainly see what the community wants but use their own judgement to determine it makes sense.  If the community started asking for space ships to be in the game or something I think blizzard should turn that down since it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Really any change that blizzard considers should have really good reasoning behind it and be overall beneficial.
---
Stonewrought Dam STILL pisses me off.
---
The amount of RP times we had back then even though none of us knew how to RP is unreal. It was such a beautiful spot to log off :'( bastards.
---
When it was popular to post stuff we're excited to see in vanilla back when classic was announced I posted that dam and got alot of love... little do people know it angers me beyond belief. I get it. I fucking get it, lore... Lore of bollocks SOME STUPID LORE NO YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME.

Thats not called burn out.
---
I was talking to you about the OP........... dear god. You do know you do not have to instantly assume everyone on Reddit is out to embarrass or insult you just because they reply to your comment.
---
It's by no means a speed leveling guide, it's subscription based, their main aim is to provide a guide that's gives an easy way to 60. Serves its purpose perfectly.
---
I wish someone would write a fully automated, transparent, DKP addon for sophisticated organization.   Would be really neat.

Thanks man I'll take a look! I'm still just finding good pieces and tools I want to use for Classic.

It’s fine if you didn’t know bro we don’t judge
---
Wouldnt it be more fun to play druid with his Rogue? Then you would be able to sneak together. In instances and whatnot.
---
At this point it's all anyone here can talk about anymore. We're all just waiting for the game's release and it's still a few weeks off.
---
I'm fairly convinced this is all a big late April Fool's joke and August 27th they'll be like "lol gotchya! New WoW trading card game for the phone!"

Healing dungeons is fine but as you said, no non-CD rez hurts. If you can find a ret/tank pally or shadow priest to group with that can help a lot.

Lazypig, Swing timer, Questie

---
I made a post about this few months ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b6db2w/bestinslot_dressing_room_how_you_will_look_from/
---
Prepare to be disappointed if you think a single layer will ever contain more than 200. 
---
You will see during stress test.
---
What I would love is a version of questie that only shows available quests to pick up, but doesn't display where to go. I love having to read quest text instead of looking at the map, but at the same time I hate missing out on quests nearby that I might miss
---
Pepehands.
---
Swing timer, recount. Pretty much all I need
---
You just need to pay for the sub. The sub includes everything except the BFA expansion but if you’re not going to play BFA (I’m not) you just need to sub to WoW and you’re good to go.
---
Tank weapon
---
No, its a Hunter weapon.
---
In a defcamp &amp; melderon shaman guide they mentioned the buff limit is 32, but you need to try really hard with nearly useless buffs to reach the cap considering a lot of buffs do not stack.
---
Around 12:40 you can see a list of possible usefull buffs  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NWG9w8qWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7NWG9w8qWI) 
---
On this list there are 27 buffs, but those include shaman totems, world buffs including some with a short duration like the one from brd for which you need to mindcontroll a npc for it, power infusion from a discipline priest, all kinds of seasonal event buffs, a atiesh wielder in your group and so on, so you should get the idea, it's pretty ridiculous.
---
For the stacking of somewhat similar buffs I can't give detailed infos since it seems that there are differences between private servers and there is not much reliable information from 13 years ago. For example elixir of mongoose (25 agi and 2% crit) and elixir of agility (25 agility) won't stack. But you should be able to stack the elixir of mongoose and a agility buff from blasted lands since those are different than elixirs. For a definitive answer you basically have to wait for classic.
---
I was following a guide, it was pretty close to Joana's current route except that it sent you to Orgrimmar before level 10, and I imagine that cost me 15m or so. Joana now recommends going straight to Crossroads without ever touching Orgrimmar, then flying back, so I guess I'll try that and see how my time works out.

Both humans and gnomes are good as mage, the thing about int on gnomes is the int scale is based off both the normal attributes and actual gear, so it's actually quite a bit, like 15-20 int gain from the racial. This matters a lot since mana regeneration is a % of your total pool. so the higher your int, the more spirit mana actually scales per point of spirit.
---
However, mages where much more heavily spirit based in vanilla wow then any other time so, humans with the spirit passive also makes them considerably good. Neither are very great specifically as a warlock, there really is no "good" warlock race in alliance, but both humans and gnomes are better then undead and trolls as mages

[What the rogue sees] (https://imgur.com/gallery/vMowVwF)
---
Would you guys say it is easier to get PvP rank 10 on PvE or PvP server?
---
gnomes are my favorite class for this reason among many more. Unfortunately, the best classes cannot be a gnome (priest and druid). I'm literally only rolling a warrior so I can play a gnome.
---
Wait, really? I mean a feather is for sure gonna take a longer time to fall than a person. Big weight difference, but I‘m just saying weight does affect that, right?
---
The surface area effects it though, so while you're right I still think it would have a bit of difference from race to race.
---
I don't mind healing in 5 mans for instance, so that doesn't bother me in either case. Stealth and travel form are totally great for leveling, and that's part of what I recall being enjoyable about it. I don't plan on speed leveling or anything like that, but I think I can consistently do an hour or two per day for the foreseeable future. I want to be able to do professions and whatnot as well, so really I'm not in a hurry. Killing someone 1v1 in wPVP was one of my favorite things about the game, so that is a strong consideration for me. 
---
Of course I could make an alt, but the rate that I think I'll be leveling it probably would be a while before I could have both built up. Just trying to decide which one to go with first. I was pretty set on shadow priest but as we get closer druid has been tempting me. But it sounds like I should stick to the original plan and then if I have time I can play a druid on the side.
---
Nah UD would act like a kite from all the holes in them
---
Well thing is, I want my name reserved and have a cool name for my bank alt and my hunter/crafting alt as well, so I'm going to create them 2 weeks before the release and if these dipshits keep it quiet I will never know if I get a streamer on my server or not.
---
They just limit me with their tardiness
---
They won't cry, they'll be gone long before november.
---
Probably pve because you’ll have much less world pvp in phase 2 than a pvp server
---
That's expensive and fast food generally does the same thing? Chili is cheap and delicious.
---
Depends on who you meet and choose to play with
---
The fact I'm being downvoted and people cant read this and realize its satire is honestly making me lose faith in the sub...
---
That's a fancy way of saying elitist gate keeping you got there.
---
Go back to retail.
---
The fuck is wrong with you?
---
Bitch don't be callin' my heals sub par!
---
I dunno where this image of no druid representation is coming from, but I swear to god back in Classic the druid population Alliance side was like 50%.
---
Just because polls from Reddit say they're unlikely to be played, Druid is one of the most popular classes in the game and, Alliance side at least, one of the more popular races.
---
Yeah, minus 10 = 4 papa - I'll give you 5 if you want to add renew...
---
&gt; look closely during the Draenor scenes and you might see some of the other Old Horde clan leaders like Grom Hellscream and I think Kargath Bladefist in the background for a few seconds
---
There's a deleted scene from the first night at camp where Grom is flexing on Durotan and Orgrim and Orgrim makes fun of him for being green.
---
I could not disagree more the wow classic devs cursed my character, a wow classic human paladin to stand at the back of raids in plate armor and heal, bless and cleanse.   Pardo, Furor and Tigole were terrible developers who inherited a great game from Bill Roper, Max Schaeffer and the Condors after Blizzard management drove them away.
---
I will never forget my shock and dismay in wow classic when I first discovered that my Protection spec was just a place holder and that I would never be allowed to tank in end game in WoW.  Because the classic devs in their infinite lack of wisdom decided that paladins would not be allowed to tank in end game, even going so far as to curse the Paladin class by denying us even a simple taunt and any end game tanking gear at all.
---
These mediocre developers who extorted their way into a carreer in game development by organizing server boycotts and crashes.   I have seen forum posts from old everquest forms where Furor ranted and raved about his hatred for hybrid classes.   Those terrible devs brought their biases with them to WoW, imposing their twisted mmo world view on WoW when they inherited it from Bill Roper and the Condors.
---
The WoW classic devs deliberately cursed my sheild-bearing, plate-wearing paladin to never ever be able to tank in end game in wow.    Why harm your own paying players and customers to prevent them from playing a role that their class was clearly designed to do because of their own pathetic personal bias?
---
***Thanks for nothing and good riddance to Pardo(Robert Pardo), Furor(Alex Afrasabi) and Tigole(Jeff Kaplan).***
---
&gt; The increased int makes it difficult to justify playing a human.
---
the 5% increased int only applies to *base int*, that is, before gear.
---
[at max level, with tier 2 gear, this means you cast about two more frostbolts before oom'ing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7qutjz/human_caster_how_much_of_a_disadvantage_is_it/dss3t9q/)

[This is the page about taming.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php)
---
Different pets have their strengths and weaknesses, bears are tankier, cats are middle, etc but when leveling in the end  it doesn't matter, get something that is fun. For raiding wolves have a group buff so you'll probably end up with one of those and two for fun.

Yup I played 14hrs, 7 days a week for my grind. I was in uni so course work waiting on queues.

I hear going Hammersmith is not great. Is this true?
---
... we don't work for blizzard- wait for wednesday for friday - they will announce.

Dad.
---
The auction house. You'll have more than enough gold from grinding to stay ahead of the gear curve and still afford all skills / mount. Sometimes I find replacement gear. [For gear recommendations I made a video on that exact subject. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV2L0oZ4VxA)
---
How about you stop controlling what is fun and what is not?
---
Thanks Dad
---
There is no point going to UD starting zone as Tauren if you're trying to farm rep. You can't ride their mounts anyway as Tauren
---
Just do something on one of your other screens, fiddle with your phone, go to the toilet, whatever. Can’t see how this is a problem or how people will think it is.
---
The only reason the feather falls slower in practice is due to air resistance. In a vacuum, everything falls at the same constant rate. A better comparison would be a bowling ball and a marble.
---
Large complex bodies would be pretty difficult to simulate due to differing surface areas, but unless you specifically oriented one to increase its resistance (like say, one horizontal and another vertical), they'd fall at more or less the same rate.
---
You too man it's gonna be a blast
---
Thanks for the tips. I'm doubtful the retail strings will work, many of the values and placeholders will have changed since classic, and there are a variety of new ones to boot.
---
I get the feeling that ElvUI for Classic will just return error messages if you try a retail string.
---
That said, I'm talking out my ass and know very little about this stuff. If anyone can clarify I'd be grateful!
---
Commenting so I remember to check.
---
Why not just meal prep a slow cooker recipe like spaghetti or stew?
---
That is a possibility too yeah. Either melee cleave or aoe group
---
Warrior flair, this advice checks out.
---
Lol sorry I don't speak twitch.
---
Cast times will be the very least of people's concerns. The forums will be flooded with complaints about class balance, respec'ing costs and bg queue times/one sidedness.
---
Still actively looking for players. Mages and Rogues are in big need.
---
I did the rough math once for a certain private server that inspired all of this. I can't remember the exact numbers but it was something like: 
---
800k accounts created * $40 for buying the game. (Get one free month here) 
---
Of those 800k, over 200k accounts were active (meaning they had seen at least one login during each month the server was open).
---
The server was open for about 13 months minus the one free month so: 200k * $15 per month * 12 months
---
Plus the original $40 purchases from the 800k leaves us at: 
---
**$68 million USD.**
---
Now this is all just rough numbers over a 12 month period. And obviously you don't have to pay the $40 to buy the game again, but the new collector's editions are out for $100 and always sell out within hours.
---
Tl;Dr: A certain inspirational private server was worth $68 million.
---
Sorry, but I can't help this:
---
~~Guild's~~ Guilds
---
Too much soda for you.
---
Unnecessary hysteria. Beware of the racists and white supremacists everyone! lmao
---
99/100 you won't be able to tell if someone used to play on a privateserver.
---
And even if you somehow manage to spot one it will be because of some in-game reasons causes by private/retail differences not because you can tell by their personality.
---
Why must people always try to antagonise some other group or start some drama. 
---
Oh wow there are people who played on private servers they are different/worse in this way and that way... 
---
Just. Play. The. Game.
---
kek
---
Well, cast times was just an example of time sinks in general. People tend to react negatively when they don't understand the "why" of something.
---
We will se on launch, you can draw absolutely no conclusions from beta or stress tests. Sins they are testing this system and as I stated it might be smaller layers the first days to handle the massive influx. But I generally believe there vill be atleast 1000+ players per layer spread over all the starting zones say like 300 ppl each this is the upside of the technology that they can keep all the ppl in different zones on same layer making the need for hundreds of layers unnecessary
---
True statement.
---
Yes, three weeks before launch.
---
Hi there,
---
I saw your post and wanted to comment to save. I'm still slightly undecided in the intensity I want to play classic in, but none the less, I liked what I read and would love to learn more.
---
A little info on me:
---
1. Former sever first, TOP 10 NA PVE progression raider, and 2600+ pvper.
---
2. Most importantly, laid back dude that’s not overly-serious/not fun to play with. Entrepreneur, nature lover, and technologist on the side.
---
Will message later on as I learn more.
---
- Juan (Viral)
---
Yeah exactly. Queue that shit up and do something else. It's not like you weren't going to be standing around in IF or Orgrimmar anyway.
---
Skills you will use every single fight as a Shadow Priest:
---
1. Shadow Word: Pain
---
2. Mind Blast
---
3. Mind Flay
---
4. Vampiric Embrace
---
5. Fear
---
6. Silence
---
7. Shield
---
8. Dispel
---
9. Renew
---
10. Heal
---
Not including long CDs, racials, buffs, consumables.
---
I am guessing Friday because its the end of the launch test and the last work day before name reservation but why do you think think Wednesday? Or even Friday for that matter?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB40nUsxelA This shows 10 people in Deadmines at level 70. I assume the lower level dungeons had different caps.
---
for pvp, fairly useless unfortunately. Mages/warlocks will burst damage you to death before they are drained of any significant mana from Feedback. Other casters can dispel it. It doesn't really have any PvE use that I can see. Might as well use mana burn. Long cooldown (3 minute) and high mana cost don't help either. 
---
But don't let the uselessness of this spell deter you from choosing human if that's the race you like more. Racials aren't significant enough to matter much anyways, unless you're min/maxing.
---
Warlock or Hunter would be pretty great for that, due to their pets could tank low level instances while being Ranged and some AoE abilities
---
FWIW:  I found this video showing that you can pair instacast spells with melee weapons that have a 1.5 second (or less) swing speed for extra damage between casts.
---
https://youtu.be/N-x2qsXKwgs
---
I think this is brilliant and anyone who has ever done some serious excel work will understand why modifiers + the same 5-6 keys you use will make a lot of sense to your brain very quickly.
---
I sincerely hope no one will be put off by this because I can see this being a complete game changer. Just for the record, I used to play druid but am intending to roll a warrior and this has been insanely help.
---
One quick thing, if I'm understanding it right I think you may have gotten the tool tip on Button 1 the wrong way around with the HS/Cleave bit in berserker/battle. So if you're holding down the modifier key whilst hovering over the macro it would show HS, whereas you would want it to show cleave no? 
---
I may just be completely misunderstanding the syntax of the macros though, I havent done this in over 10 years and was mostly reverse engineering the meaning of the code in my head
---
Yes, even teargas is included in cc.
---
herb/alc from the beginning IMO.
---
Tailoring is overrated. You're leveling it just for one armor piece that is BiS until T2. People forget to mention that this entails getting the tailoring recipe which has a &lt;4% drop from a main boss from Strat. It's a BOE recipe so you can get it from the AH, but it's going to cost 500g-700g+. So you can either farm your ass off at Strat, or spend half your epic mount money on the recipe. 
---
If you're min/maxing, then level tailoring by all means. But the 2nd best armor isn't a huge step down and  is much easier to get (14% drop from Baron in Strat) -   [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346)
---
Herb/alc can boost you a lot while leveling, in dungeons, in world pvp, and endgame.  Very useful IMO.
---
Looooooooooots of people play without nameplates on. Like, tons  and tons of casual players.
---
I like most of the time sinks, I'm in anticipation of getting something I worked hard for from crafting. Or a spell with a long cast time will have big effects.
---
Yeah I think you should go back to twitch chat and be with your own kind. You're so out of place here it must be extremely uncomfortable.
---

---
Holy shit man, I just woke up my wife sleeping next to me with that fuckin’ loud laugh you gave me.
---
When you consider how much it actually does for you for 1 talent point, it's far from worthless
---
As has been answered a million times here and per their own statement yes......
---
Yeah but running out of focus doesn't matter from a pure DPS stand point.
---
We don't know
---
We are more than an hundred, a french-Canadian guild. One of many French-Canadian guilds. All coming from pservers. There's 3 millions of accounts on the server I play on. 
---
Pservers were used as a reference for classic bug reports and was discussed in length. The only difference we found was a couple percent dodge on elite mobs 3+ levels, mob density and mob respaw rate. 
---
The reason why phase I-II-III will be a breeze is 1.12 itemization. They released dungeon set tier so that new player could join the newest raids at the end. Those item will be available at release. That means the lower tier raids will be super easy.
---
Sounds like you'll be on Horde side, so just find a Shaman/Priest to DPS in your dungeon and you won't have to worry about the limited res
---
Do you think blizzard is going to ban people for dropping the occasional twitch emote in Barrens chat? No. They'd lose tons of subs and as long as they're not just mindlessly spamming, it isn't any more disruptive than a normal chatter. I understand muting though.
---
He's right
---
There is no "character creation unlock day"
---
Name reservation is August 12th in the best place on earth, and launch is August 26th.
---
Realm names will be announced sometime between tomorrow and launch.
---
Constantly talking about it will not affect the announcement time.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not attempting to make an excuse for this behavior I still believe it is extremely shitty and immature.  I’m just not trying to jump on a bandwagon and escalate it into something so drastic when it could be explained but something much more common.
---
I know this may be a bad example just because the N word is so bad.  But if someone were to say “This stupid fucking bitch” or something of that nature I wouldn’t assume they are a misogynist or anything but maybe just a moron who doesn’t understand the weight behind their own words.
---
And just to clarify again, I’m not defending anyone, if anyone used this word as a grown ass adult they are for sure a piece of fuckin work, but I wouldn’t necessarily put them in a white supremacy group unless they show clear signs of it.
---
I come from a wotlk pserver. Wotlk has 0 content on azeroth, yet there was open world pvp all the time, +80vs+80 was not uncommon (but it lagged a lot, like 15 seconds were nothing happened, I hope classic wow can have that many people on the screen and not collapse)
---
I really can’t fathom after 15 years of this game how people still can’t understand everyone has their own way of playing the game for enjoyment.
---
How about you play the way you want and I’ll play the way I want?
---
Pepelaugh he doesn't know.
---
Anyone used Joanas guide for leveling with a friend? Guessing you don't have to change much except account for class specific quests and figure out the best time to do them, yeah?
---
'be on a server where pve content is huge. '
---
PvE content is huge on PvE servers. 
---
And because PvE raid gear is almost always better than PvP gear. PvE is going to be huge on PvP servers as well.
---
just reminded me to add this to my wow classic playlist for my sessions
---
I'm not at all saying paladins are bad and my thinking is very meta, but I just don't see how a paladin could overcome being mana burned and drained. The thing about this set up is that both the warlock and priest are actually quite tanky (soul link and shadow form, damage reducing bubbles, health stones and health potions) while also among the strongest pvp classes on their own. With paladins you have not as much protection vs fear. Both the warlock and priest can dispel AND silence. The priest can even switch out of shadow form to pop a little healing if possible. It's hard to just survive a shadow priest and warlocks front loaded damage.   
---
If it's a ret paladin he won't get into melee ever before being mana burned. If it's a healer/protection?? then one dd will not be able to kill the warlock or the priest. Or what class do you think would be best suited vs warlock/priest? I love theory crafting and I have played wow classic since beta but only bc for a few arena seasons.
---
None if I can avoid them.

---
This is a bad plan.
---
Let's say the worst-case scenario happens, and you end up at lvl 12ish with still just your backpack...you will absolutely have more than enough money to buy 4 6slot bags off the NPC vendor:
---
[Small Brown Pouch](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4496#sold-by) ... it's 5s a pop, 20 silver total.
---
So no, there is absolutely no reason to level a tailor-alt just for that. You just put your leveling progress in the bin doing so.
---
Narrator: It wasn't.
---
and copying an average rogue at that, just a damn good video editor

---
personally I'm planning on going something like this.
---
Still a few things I'm considering such as whether to put the 5 points in cruelty before working on arms tree or after anger management since it is a strong talent. 
---
Later levels could either go deeper into fury if you plan on full time dpsing, though I put a few into prot to grab some pretty important prot talents that should make tanking dungeons at higher levels easier while not forcing me to respec around constantly. 
---
Only thing there is I don't know enough about prot priorities otherwise so maybe there's a better choice than the 3 points I put into defense skill such as armor or stun resist and I am wondering where to place my final 3 points. could go towards 3% more parry, or increased threat, or something else entirely.
---
How much loot normally dropped in one raid run?  And how long would it normally take to get fully geared for that tier?
---
Couldn't have said it better myself! I'm never been too interested in endgame, I'm all about the immersion of the journey and leveling experience. Maybe see you on the road friend!
---
Group up for quest mobs.
---
Low functioning autism. A think /Asmongold would be a better fit for you. Just my 2 cents.
---
I plan on being about 6 hours late on launch due to work.  That will be Monday night for me with central time launch in na.  Get off work at 11 and start the binge.  Taking Tuesday-thursday off for that initial burst all wow all day.  After that all my time will be the twilight hours after work until the sun comes up.
---
Slightly worried about finding a good raiding guild that doesn't start any raids before about 10pm pdt.  Hopefully there's some hardcore homies out there that also work b shift with similar hours.  Can't wait either way.
---
We have players player all over !  
---
with over 300 members on discord we offer more than one guild
---
For the longest time I also read it as "Tauren Mill", quite confusing.
---
I can't believe someone who uses the term Poggers actually cares about Classic WoW.  Are you even old enough?  This game is rated T for teen!
---
The Jabberwocky has found its way to r/classicwow! 
---
Quick!
---
Bring me thy Vorpal Blade!
---
Is that even ported to Classic? If so please link :)
---
I’d ask why they don’t bring back pvp vendors
---
Why do people try to make this argument? AddOns were prevelant in classic as well.
---
Damn boy, there will be no 60s at launch, stop spreading the hate!
---
Zygor is not alliance only.
---
That works too, then you will know because you can’t duplicate that name (streamers name), therefore you know they are in that server and you can leave to another.
---
Sorry for the stupid question but does this mean vanilla addons won’t work with classic?
---
That's awesome. Thanks for sharing
---
You really have zero idea what you are talking about.
---
Yes, I prefer to be a caster and kite rather than melee and have to stick on my target.
---
Doesn't mean they are necessarily... you can play BFA with no addons - Omegalul
---
The disconnect you're making here is not distinguishing between active and passive WPVP.
---
Sure, battlegrounds may have put a big dent in people going out into the world looking for trouble, but they have no real impact on spontaneous WPVP, which is what flying undermines. Safety is no longer a concern when you can just mount up and fly somewhere safe or just hang out high up in the air while you AFK for a bit. It's on-demand safety. It also makes WPVP griefing even more one-sided and easy to accomplish since a max-level player who has played enough to get flying can just swoop down on levelers or freshly capped plebs who don't have flying yet. It's just completely lopsided. At least on the ground you have a chance to spot the incoming ganker and hide or get away before you become a victim instead of getting dive bombed.
---
Hunter can be used to pull large packs for spellcleave.  You don't even know if it's good but you say hunters won't want to do it?  Why argue when you have no idea what is going on?
---
Dude you're freaking epic
---
Because the method isn't well documented yet and I didn't play the beta yes.
---
Lol, I have it a little easier than you think. My mouse has two buttons where the thumb sits. I have Alt and Ctrl mapped to them.
---
&gt; From what I've seen they are especially disliked in dungeons because of lack of normal ressurection 
---
This will not matter for the most part. Unless you join ultra hardcore dungeon groups only consisting of pure dps classes, which are not really desirable.
---
There are gonna be enough shadow priests, enh/ele shaman and ret/tank paladins willing to do dungeons for having at least 1 normal rez player. And worst case scenario, well you can still go back in the instance on foot. That's what happens when the group wipes anyway. Most people won't let the healer go back solo to rez everyone because they're lazy
---
As for the part of your post when you talk about druid demand etc, as many other said, you're gonna be fine. Most people don't play a class for its efficiency, but because of subjective appreciation of several aspects of the class. Therefore they won't even have those thoughts going through their head. They'll just take you. This is 100% true for dungeons.
---
For raids it's very likely that most guilds on all servers will be casual and struggle to find 40 regular players, meaning 8-10 healer that show up. So again, unless you aim for hardcore groups, server firsts or speedrunning content faster in average, you don't need to worry. Everyone can find like-minded people, whether you're hardcore/topTierClass or not.
---
Cool story.
---
What's with this excessive omegaluling, this is next level Cringe.
---
It is well documented, you just don't know it.  Do some research.

That’s why you don’t simulate, you test some uh candidates....

But why do you have the need to tell that to a person, that clearly states he wants to use addons?
---
Doing things efficiently is not laziness..
---
Cringey!
---
I'll be recreating my originals as alts. Hoping to focus on Druid as main, for literally the first time ever.
---
1) There aren't many tanks in the guild and they do all need gear. You'll get geared quickly.
---
2) Most will roll 2-3 warriors and a feral, with fury DPS equipping shields and going tank stance for bosses that demand more.
---
3) If you're a warrior: Nightfall/Annihilator duty. Both are very important and are really good on offtanks. Also make sure Thunderclap and Demoshout are on, Battleshout is active, debuff/buff management is important and while you have 39 others, you're one of them, make sure you do your part!
---
4) For the most part, you can just go Deep Prot and later on go Fury/Prot if your guild is fine with it, just like the MT, to increase your threat. 
---
5) I have not Offtanked in Vanilla, but am really looking forward to it. I've tanked in many other MMOs and have done excessive research, and have off-tanked in several expansions and it's really enjoyable. 
---
6) Be there for (close to) every raid, make friends in your guild so you can exchange consumables between each other (tanks need most consumables on hand, farming em yourself is really demanding) and you'll be fine time-wise. 
---
7) Skarm is an awesome source for all things tank, both feral + Warrior, can highly recommend him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSzLn3iRK-g

If we're going the Classic+ route, you could also tone down already existing raid gear by making it scale a bit less crazily, while adjusting for balance.
---
Would be *really* tough to do and upset a lot of people if done wrongly, but is an option. Probably not the best one, but alas, that'd make sure you can add a T4-6 easily.

If you max skinning on your way to 60 as a hunter/warlock. You can kill the elite dragons in burning steppes and Devilsaurs in ungoro for some valuable leather working mats to AH.
---
Unless he and his friend level slow, and take a long time to hit 60, its going to be a while before there are level 60's out ganking low levels. His experience for at least the first couple weeks should be camp-less
---
Stupid comparison. Compare it to TF.

I played a warrior back in vanilla, and remember how utterly slow that grind was I’m not going to relive it. From alliance warrior to horde Druid I go.
---
&gt;PVE rotations should be interesting at the cost of everything else class design wise
---
Yeah, I love raiding but fuck that hard.
---
I don't play the same class, the same race or the same faction. I want something new
---
I'm almost 100% certain this is how it will work
---
I literally just described every arena battle, ever. From the lowliest noob like you, to top tier player's like OrangeMarmalade. You are critiquing yourself, lol.
---
Thanks! I like your idea and makes sense. I'm too old to be min maxing anyways with less playtime than back in original vanilla :)
---
Each boss in Molten Core drops 1-3 items, probably closer to 2.5 on average. Add in BoEs dropping 1-3 per run means there is around 28 epic drops per run. So around 75% of the raid is getting one item. This isn't considering recipes, gathering, disenchanting, etc. 
---
Unfortunately, because of random number generation I believe it is hard to get a full tier set unless you were in a high-end guild....and were lucky. 
---
The matters gets more complicated when you start considering that many BiS gear may not come from a current raid, but rather dungeons, quests, etc.
---
Napkin mathed it the other day and if you have to make yourself and 4 friends (my friends group is playing together) 5 [Runecloth Bag]s each it would take about 52 minutes of casting time just to craft them. That's counting crafting the [Bolt of Runecloth] for them in the craft time.
---
I hope they will at the last stress test.
---
I hope it works for you, I tried to check out the leveling guide but I hated it. Either way, enjoy a month off from work :)
