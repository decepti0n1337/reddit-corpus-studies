Because we'll be in 1.12, where aggro had already been nerfed to shit in prep for BC, trivializing tanking.

If you are alliance warlock you will typically be conflag spec in group pvp since you lack the on demand burst shamans bring.
---
Thanks bro. But I have the money. What I dont have is the time and other consoles and games to play than to just pointlessly waste cash on a classic re-release every month. Plus I have a brain that can make deductions with my budget unlike these brainless drones that just spend, spend, spend.

He said low level pvp

i remember seeing the same blood elf on guest passes and iirc game time cards. Who Is She

You sound like you think this is Dance Dance Revolution and the only way to win is to hit your perfect 99 point combo.
---
1. Not an asshole
---

---
2. Communicate with and engage the viewers in conversation 
---
3. As another guy said, no in game posse following them around carrying them through everything
---
4. No corpse camping other players
---
Little hostile there
---
And yet WoW still has hundreds of thousands of people.  Now though you are getting two games for that same price.
---
To ask a question an and get opinions. But I can see that this subreddit is nothing but toxicity and elitism.  Fucking pathetic.
---
That's probably a good call to modify it a bit. It wasn't all bad, but could use some balance tweaks for sure.
---
Still way better than the halo board game!
---
&gt; throwing away money
---
If you think playing this game is "throwing away money"
---
it's not a game for you. Might i suggest https://store.steampowered.com/  to find a game you'd enjoy?
---
Isn't it a one hand weapon?
---
D a p Ee bb
---
I dunno how it was for other servers, trade chat on my realm in retail was dead within 2 months of BFA
---
The same goes for every single class except holy paladin, they all have to respec for pvp.
---
Please don’t. I came back to retail after several years of not playing that GS is what turned me off the most. So much wasted time, so many kicks because the leader found a player with 1 or 2 more points than I had...
---
More like interesting and sometimes unbalanced. Blizz has had this unhealthy obsession with trying to make its game esport friendly. Why do you think we got stuff like item levels and an obsession with perfect balance? Such a small percentage of the playerbase participates in the world first stuff or cares about min/maxing to your fullest potential.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's time for Blizzard to go at least half way and make gear interesting again. I think they have been starting to experiment with it a bit again with 8.2, so we shall see what the future holds.
---
Classic Cast with Esfand is also  great
---
I don't really care about all that I'm just commenting on saying it's not asking much.  it's asking a lot as shown by all those games that tried to ask it and failed.
---
orbwalking? learning individual mechanics of 100+ different champions? lane positioning? The overall apm required to move efficiently in a moba? it's not as simple as you make it out to be. Sorry i'm too stupid to understand anything you're saying.
---
Nothing is free....
---
Instead, meet someone on a bridge or top of bank and have them aggressively inspect and judge you
---
Why can't someone put judgement of wisdom on the boss?
---
Let's leave politics out of it
---
Don't worry I'm sure gearscore will be a thing.
---
maybe just having a bad dat. he deleted his comments so maybe he realized
---
Smith &amp; Engineer for endgame - could also take  mining instead of smithing
---
Item level existed in Classic and BC, it was just hidden from view.
---
You being a woman doesn't mean you hang out with other women. It's pretty clear that you don't if you think we're all free of aggression and competitive natures. Every show and movie with a High School backdrop has catty teenage girls, what you've outlined as being not for girls is the straight up stereotype of teenage girls.  Shooters and Sports games are also not the only PvP games in the world, given that we're talking about MMO PvP I would think you wouldn't link pointless stats but here we are.
---
If I was so broke I couldnt afford $10 a month, I'd be touchy too
---
I don't recommend bringing politics here, Rule 5
---
What you do, and what those pug groups did, is that if you don't have the achievement, you're the one making the group. Invite some friends to show that it's not just an empty raid, then recruit people to carry you.
---
You can't click share your profession in classic right? I don't think so, cause I remember those enchanters that wrote a novel in the trade chat.
---
I suppose you're right, I think he's just trolling though
---
Totally get what you're saying, I'm exactly the same with grass is greener syndrome.
---
That being said: gathering profs to get extra vendor cash or stockpile for taking profs later on is objectively a good idea (provided you're not going for speed leveling).
---
Yea it is actually. Let’s people actually FIGURE OUT what works and what doesn’t rather than just giving you your gear basically.

When the elitist mom declares it one.

Shaman main here. Nothing indeed.
---
So you go into Toyota dealerships and proclaim "$24,095 for a CAMRY!?!?! in 2004 they were $17,043!!!"
---
Well you're wrong.  You are trying to say they failed because they were $15/mo and that's not the case.  Even if it were, WoW has been chugging along just fine for fifteen years at that same price and still has hundreds of thousands of players.
---
Back when MMOs were a big deal, "hundreds of thousands of players" was good.  You can't call it a failure when it's still [the champ](https://mmo-population.com).  If we assume this is even remotely accurate, WoW is doing just fine at its price point.
---
But now you're getting two games for the price of one.
---
Yes, there are blood/high elves in vanilla. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Former_high_elf_models
---
The blood elf in the cinematic is very obviously based on the BC blood elf models, and also based on the "addicted to magic" lore than was substantially beefed up for BC.
---
I prefer 2 separate battle nets i have my main account from 2005 with wow1 and wow2 plus another Bnet account with one subscription that is my hide from friends account. I only had trouble one time because i was moving large amounts of gold between accounts and it somehow caught blizzards attention and once i talked with a GM everything worked out
---
He's just trolling
---
&gt; Classic is only ~5 GB currently, so you aren’t going to be hurting on space.
---
That really surprised me, considering retail client is like 70+ GB. I mean, I knew it would be significantly lower, but I hadn't expected it to be that low.
---
Who cares?  It's worth it to me at $15/mo.  If it's not to you, don't play.
---
"Giving away" money to businesses providing a service isn't giving money away. It's commerce...
---
&gt;Call me cheap all you want but I ain't broke. And damn sure ain't stupid enough to spend money on shit I wont be using.
---
What kind of ignorabt shit is this? WE will be using it for many many hours. If you don't want to wecdon't give a shit, but painting it as greedy is intellectually disingenuous. 
---
&gt;I'm reading indicate most of yall are either living off your moms credit card or you're a man baby. So which one is it?

Are you shitting me dude? We're all in our 30s by now, and most of us have degrees and careers and shit now. You're a huge jackass dude just stop.

Sure, you "can" do anything, but you *will* be a healer.

How about without an ez reset?
---
I was a little worried I wasn't going to finish my AmbiBox/Adalight setup, but I knocked it out on a Sunday evening with some cardboard and masking tape. Other than that, no.
---
Fury has the edge. You can dual wield as fury if necessary. 2Hand tanking is also a thing but only makes sense when you're overgeared.
---
Nice. Hopefully Blizzard can clarify the fuzzy details of loot added in later phases.
---
Ion's tweet is a good basis but not 100% set in stone.
---
I think you're too stupid for me to waste my time.  you're so worked up over some shit nobody cares about.  I don't care how much wow costs holy shit dupe stop frothing at the mouth.  bye
---
&gt;It ain't a matter of being too "BROKE" to afford it. It's the fact that whether it's 10 fucking cents or 10 dollars, throwing away money and just giving it away to Blizzard/Activision is FUCKING STUPID!!!
---
&gt;Call me cheap all you want but I ain't broke. And damn sure ain't stupid enough to spend money on shit I wont be using. 
---
&gt;And let's face it, the comments I'm reading indicate most of yall are either living off your moms credit card or you're a man baby. So which one is it?
---
This guy is a legitimately hateful stupid, stupid person.
---
Wealth and poverty are inherently political
---
I don’t see how you can’t figure it out through context... clearly you don’t get the point of 
---
We aren’t trying to be argumentative with you, I promise.
---
But it’s not trying to figure out which gear with stats is .0001 better because it has the slight RNG stat rolls BFA does now.
---
Different gear had different stats in vanilla too but there were also different set bonuses. 
---
In the end with a finite set of possible items there is objectively a ranking of gear being better than other gear for reasons. A Gearscore  addon will boil that down to a precise numerical value. 
---
And raid leaders will very likely utilize it to save time and effort thinking “is this player geared well enough for this fight/wing/raid?”
---
He's here to troll of course
---
me, TBC isn't vanilla there could be many changes between the two.
---
&gt; For mining you need a mining pick which can be bought off of a vendor.
---
mining picks not needed on retail. Just the skill.
---
Rule 5 bro
---
After seeing their retail servers I'd disagree strongly. Their whole system works on sharding tech to help carry the load
---
So jealous
---
The casual classic - is one I found today that I’m thoroughly enjoying. Much shorter episodes than countdown to classic and the two hosts have good chemistry. They’re also literally talking about their plans for level 1-10, 10-20, 20-30 and so on along with some reminiscing. I really enjoyed countdown to classic but lately I feel like it’s just the same thing over and over and the 3 hour episodes are too much.
---
No, that tool just finds you four other people. It doesn't consider roles at all. Which is why no one ever used it.
---
if the fights are different the class balance is different if the class balance is different the game is different.
---
Nice
---
But were they called blood elves in wc3?
---
New ones are 39.99 each now.
---
Making what up?
---
Working on finishing platinuming FFXII Zodiac, and reading all the Lonesome Dove books.  I’ll have time to platinum one more game before release but I have no idea what it will be, maybe I’ll finally start P5 idk.
---
No, there will be realm wide Discord servers too. The public chat channels of old Vanilla are history and aren't coming back.
---
Hunters are better than warlocks lol.
---
Being good in vanilla wow comes down to the little things. No, you don't have to do it the best way, just know that other people will and they will be better than you. That's just the nature of the game.
---
Eh, if that's the case that would be the perfect opportunity to quit and get my life back together after Classic Vanilla runs its course.
---
Lionheart Helm - Plans drop in MC, bis plate DPS until next expac  
---
Wild Growth Spaulders - Drops in MC, bis resto druid until next expac  
---
Pure Elementium Band - Drops in BWL, bis all healers until next expac
---
That's just a few examples out of probably more than a dozen items that are early-mid content progression but are BiS forever.
---
I like the idea... would there be a gold buy in?
---
[deleted]
---
Yes. 
---
In statistics often an unbiased estimator and an unbiased estimator will converge to the same value as the number of observations inreases. For example the (biased) estimator of sample variance given by summing the squares of the difference between the sample mean and a particular sample divided by the number of samples, and the (unbiased) sample variance given by the same algorithm as above, but with Bessels correction (dividing by the number of samples minus one instead of the number of samples) will converge to the same value as the number of obervations increase.
---
Gearscore is a terrible measurement, period.
---
i don't care about your spergy brother's feelings though

Word

Usually fine with a stack unless your pretty is doing a lot.
---
no dude.  nobody did that.  most people throw away their trash they don't keep it as memorabilia
---
&gt;What u or I think subjectively is meaningless.
---
The entire thread is about if it is worth your money to play it or not.  It's like you are just using words without knowing their meaning.

I think this guy is brain damaged. Ignore the troll guys, he won’t be missed
---
Night Elf is actually BiS for Stealth, Dodge, Crit,  Jump, Idle, and Death animation, so I dno what people you're listening to but clearly they have no taste.
---
In all seriousness though you're gonna spend hundreds of hours on this character so pick what you like to look at unless you're VERY competitive and will be bothered by even the slightest disadvantage compared to what you could have otherwise.
---
Also stealth dodge and crit are actually higher on night elves than normal, if you want to try evasion tanking they're definitely the best at that, and they have an advantage in getting the opener on other stealth classes in pvp, and remaining undetected in large scale fights. 
---
These aren't as easily measurable and calculatable as "+15% damage on glancing blows"  or whatever the human racial translates into, but to suggest they are subpar rogues due to their racials is absolutely silly.
---
People will pug further than that
---
Warms my heart that the first comment I saw on here was about gearing ferals. Good luck in classic ! wolfshead helm is going to be my priority.
---
Mage: All I am is dps. Nothing more. Its my favorite class, but its not as interesting as the other classes.
---
I’ve been playing how many new posts can I find on this subreddit everyday.
---
The year is 2019.
---
Not poor. But you are an elitist my friend. Great quality to have. /sarcasm
---
Ye, I went through some old stuff sometime ago and [found some](https://i.redd.it/0997skv4kiq21.jpg).
---
I’m very conflicted now lol
---
No way. 30 year old boomers like me sure as shit won't want to fuck around with discord for non-guild chat, let alone try to find a channel specific to our realm.
---
Didnt most resto druids run 0/30/21 in classic
---
The monitor I'm using is Samsung 49" LED LC49RG90SSUXEN.
---
You take corruption 2/5 to save you half a sec on every mob, then you take imp imp to boost your overall damage by about 10%and continue down Affliction tree getting instant corruption etc. If you're PvPing before level 18 you're doing something terribly wrong.
---
*Skill Score
---
If someone uses GS that person goes to the blacklist immediately. Whether it's a joke or not I will not tolerate that disease.
---
Most people will probably just vendor the skins
---
I was thinking maybe 5-10g since gold is tough to come by.
---
They can’t take down a lot of the private servers, their european or russian and untouchable to American lawsuits
---
GS was something since Wrath, you don't have to know bfa.

&gt;Despite really only needing 25 people with knowledge of the fights, [...]

&gt;[...] my ***guild*** is already recruited,[...]

Mm... *Neat*.
---
No one really says it's not viable outside of Naxx. A lot of people say it's not viable until you have gear from AQ and they cite your crit chance as the reason. The old EJ forums talked about needed your Backstab to have a ~55% crit chance before it became viable.
---
But what people don't understand is that this threshold is obtainable in every raid phase and your crit chance in BIS Phase 5 gear is actually *lower* than your crit chance in BIS Phase 2 gear.
---
In Phase 1 pre-raid BIS, you have 15.62% crit chance from gear.
---
In Phase 2 pre-raid BIS, you have 16.03% crit chance from gear.
---
In Phase 2 BIS, you have 21.93% crit chance from gear.
---
In Phase 3 BIS, you have 18.10% crit chance from gear.
---
In Phase 4 BIS, you have 17.55% crit chance from gear.
---
In Phase 5 BIS, you have 19.76% crit chance from gear.
---
And in Phase 6 BIS, you have 27.72% crit chance from gear.
---
Audio files and all those cutscenes/cinematics over 15 years really add up. Remember, Vanilla used to be installed on five CDs (iirc).
---
Except they're not figuring it out. They're looking up a BiS list on Reddit.
---
Yeah I was around 300 when I played vanilla
---
In wotlk, I did roll a druid and pal sfor this reason; heal, tank, DPS
---
My main was a mage and sometimes it was boring to play a single role
---
I don't know if I will play classic and which class I will pick, but a dual role with either tank or heal + DPS would be great
---
Not sure how old you are, but as a kinesiology major and fitness advocate I highly recommend starting now.
---
You see a lot of old people, you see a lot of fat people, but you dont see a lot of fat old people.
---
Plus if you dont live long how will you see what happens in half life 3?
---
I've also been playing the Witcher. Went back to play the doc. I swear blood and wine is as big as the base game.
---
Best advice here, even at 60 arms could tank a 5 man with a sword and board
---
Honestly I feel like a lot of old wow players would have enjoyed FFXIV if it didn’t have the initial poor launch year. They had to fight tooth and nail to get even half of the people that wanted try that MMO out as an alternative to WoW. A lot of WoW players I knew came from FFXI before.
---
That's reassuring to hear!
---
Tbh tho he is spewing shit. Especially no proof. Look at “famous” ret paladin esfand who arguably puts in as much effort as possible and man does he under parse. He’s not pulling 1.2k or anywhere NEAR that in naxx. Until this guy links his legacy players logs that he’s doing that I’m also gonna  all BS. 
---
The onus is on him to prove he’s playing ret like that because in reality he’s parroting bs he read on a forum or here on classicwow
---
Why's that?
---
Wasn’t that a thing? When did that gear score plugin come out before it was officially implemented ?
---
&gt;ret bad
---
Wrath.
---
that makes sense if you want to make a pug with a chance of completing Naxx
---
While we are at it i think food should be free and movies should be a dollar
---
Nah in Classic we will have to trust the player's skills... ohhhh man what a shitshow it'll be, can't wait.
---
Close enough. Closer to vanilla than we are now.
---
stop hoarding dumb shit
---
I realized this. I was going to roll Dwarf Priest for the min/max, then thought about good memories of leveling as Horde on a fresh server, so decided I'll have a second server and level a Tauren Shaman there (never played Shaman), and then I thought about how awesome Night Elf Hunters are because of Shadowmeld, so I decided to have that be my alt on my Alliance server, and then I thought about how I've never really played the ideal pure DPS class, so I decided that an Undead Mage will be my alt on my Horde server.
---
So yeah, I'm already planning on Dwarf Priest, Tauren Shaman, Night Elf Hunter, and Undead Mage.
---
Or should I go Orc Shaman? I've always liked Warstomp, and it fits well with Shaman spells, but Orc stun resistance is passive and I don't even have to press a button for it. That's appealing. Eh, I guess I'll still go Tauren.
---
I have an old 2010 iMac and keep getting an error that my “3D graphic accelerator card is not supported”. I was able to play Legion fine but was locked out of BFA. 
---
Am I out of luck for Classic too?
---
Many will figure it out. That's how the lists got compiled in the first place. Not everyone goes to online resources to get told how to gear, talent and level. Many people play a MMORPG to go experience and figure things out themselves. Some would say that's the best part of the game.
---
Nicely done OP!
---
WoW has always had item levels...
---
Did they actually say the name Blood Elf, or did they wait till wow’s Burning Crusade to give them the new name?
---
Somebody passed with flying colors. Probably due to their superior cognitive abilities of recognizing what a steal classic WoW is!! 2 games for the price of 1!!
---
A hunter pet can tank a dungeon.   They're the worst spec in the game, because they are totally useless in raids.
---
Really want to go holy play, but all I keep hearing is boring boring boring.
---
Thanks for this post and the one you made a month ago. It helped a lot over on MMO-Champion dispelling the myth that Classic is going to run like BfA.
---
For some reason quite a few people seem convinced that it's only the client that determines performance and everything else is fluff. It's frustrating because they're trying to tell people that already have adequate setups to go out and spend $400+ all based on their guess.
---
Biggest tip for Horde: Play Troll SPriest. Shadowguard and Hex of Weakness are much better in PvP than Dev Plague and WotF.
---
Priest trinket already dispells fear.
---
I must. Sure they will farm them the 1st week maybe even the 1st month, but it will grow tiresome.
---
Wow thanks for all the replies everyone, definitely have some content to watch till release now!
---
Yeah I was talking more about the people that have a shoddy laptop or pc already but still want to play
---
They were. Their color changed to red and they got units like the spellbreakers. Which were hilarious anti casters.
---
Fury is objectively superior to Arms from a DPS perspective pre-40. Post-40, it's really a matter of how good your gear is and how you want to level. If you're fully twinked and loaded up on mage food, go ahead and do the Arms thing (pool rage against one mob, then cleave down two mobs with an SS/WW/Cleave/MS rotation). If not, you're better off killing mobs one at a time as Fury. Aside from SS, a Fury Warrior will be picking up all of the Arms talents you mentioned after filling out Fury.
---
Gearscore was in wrath and used weighted for stats and not itemlevel, right? I feel like you could create a useful approximation based on good weights.
---
Ilvl as it's used in retail would be pretty useless though, it's true.
---
Go Bowling for five bucks, three times a month.  You know that all they use that money on is maintenance, right?  They're not actually updating bowling at all!  How fucking dare they!
---
&gt; maybe the beginning of week 2 because you want a world first
---
Rag is going to be dead before then.
---
Yea I'll answer hostility with hostility.
---
Boot speed enchants, especially if you stock the mats.  No other single enchant speeds up leveling more.
---
&gt; As of mid-June, 2019, the client does not support DX12, which means it does not have the ability to use more processing threads like its little brother, Battle for Azeroth. So, Classic will be primarily limited by the speed of a single core or thread on your system.
---
What? Do you seriously think games need DirectX 12 to use several threads? And do you actually think retail WoW only used one thread until recently? Please tell me this is just really bad wording.
---
I know that feeling. 
---
I cant decide between Druid or Pally. Played Holy Pally in BC and Feral Druid all The way since cataclysm.
---
After reading a few posts here I admit that I'm starting to be inclined(Sorry If this word inst correct) to choose paladin. People keep saying that druids can't tank and are squishy (hard to believe because of that great armor!).
---
Yes, but there were lots of people who had the free time compared to know. Most of the younger audience with loads of free time don't exist because they are playing other games like fortnite or minecraft. The only people interested in a game like this are of an older generation and most players will be having a job/family compared to back then.
---
That my friend is a draw.
---
Delayed, not cancelled.
---
There's your mistake, that just starts the cycle
---
Why dont you say how you rly feel instead of just projecting?
---
If Disney ends up buying out they will.  Disney has reach in just about every  country.
---
They're also the only class that can't weild daggers.... Mages can literally stab better than paladins
---
GO SKINNING!!
---
You need around 4500 pieces of rugged leather to get your darkmoon neck (its bis)
---
You also need skinning to get Chestplate of Bloodthirst (its bis for a VERY long time). 
---
Good luck!
---
For pvp, I don't think combat is the way to go. 21/8/22 and 31/8/12 were the pvp dagger specs back in the day, I think.
---
For leveling, combat swords is the best (18/33/0 or something).
---
Mining / Skinning then Mining / Engineering at 60. Priests generally go for Herbalism so it's better to go for Mining as Warrior but either works just fine. Also note that Engineering is the easiest profession in the game to level and pairs well with both Herbalism and Mining.
---
Multi-threaded improvements were added when the game switched over to DX12 - yes, there were other improvements along the way, but noticeable and drastic improvements occurred when the game moved to DX12.
---
reminder that brood war still exists
---
You are making the mistake of thinking that this game is 80% raiding. It's not. Your average player, playing about 20-25 hours a week, is going to likely raid 6-8 hours a week. So that's roughly a 3rd of the game. There are other things in wow besides raiding. Things like Battlegrounds, dungeons, RP, questing, farming, World pvp, ganking, just to name a few.
---
I think too many people (maybe as a result of playing retail over the last 10 years) either think that raiding or arena-like pvp should be the center of the wow universe. It simply isn't. Especially with the vanilla version of WoW, this is a diverse MMORPG game. Google that acronym and think about what it means.
---
No, what you don't need is an "overkill setup" to play Classic. The research in this post is proof of that.
---
The value of WoW is based on personal opinion. But thanks for that little lesson in economics. I've never heard of inflation before.
---
Having a bad day? 
---
Want to talk about it?
---
As a warrior you have to deal with constantly reminding shamans to drop windfury ;)
---
I think the bethnic gear being so good due to some of its special abilities was the mistake. BiS shouldn't be so easy to get. I think preach made a video explaining how this could have easily been solved if some of the abilities on it only applied to open world content within Nazjatar.  Either way it is a trade off.
---
BWL was the guild breaker. That's when you learn who you're carrying.
---
If you think the younger generation had anything more than a token representation in progressing guilds you didn't raid in vanilla.  The officers, class leads, and core raiders... the people organizing UBRS runs and trying to recruit in their 5 mans?  Those people were virtually all working adults.  Were there a few guys filling roles that were still in high school? Absolutely, but it's not like they had anything to do with killing bosses other than showing up on time. 
---
Don't really see why classic isn't going to attract at least some younger players too, it did back then and there's nothing keeping people from trying it for the first time now.

It's more than a week to allow the influx of players starting at the same time to spread out over the map
---
No. But yall should rly stop projecting.
---
not that guy, but MOBAs are only harder than fortnite in two categories:  domain knowledge required (item builds, abilities of tons of different heroes, etc) and team coordination. In terms of mechanical skill, fortnite is overwhelmingly more demanding at pretty much every level of play.
---
They are good dps up till aq40 so you should be fine.  They are strong in pvp as well all the way to endgame.
---
Just trying to help, my friend, have a wonderful day
---
Thanks for this
---
It's 379 and for the price it's a good value for a wow player sub 400

Your bitching about the price makes me believe you don't even have a GED, otherwise you'd be employed at a job where $10 a month doesn't matter.
---
Probably your upper lip homie.
---
I don't think so. In TBC our GM would regularly give tanks gold for repairs. It's an expensive job and I think respecs should be fair game if they're asking you to go out of your way to come tank for them? Then heck yeah ask for gold.

I spent $40 on a single magic the gathering card yesterday.

I think that's why people complain.  Same issue for me as a warlock, it isn't the fact I have to farm soulshards (necessarily), more so that I don't have any bag space lol.
---
Damn I remember playing on low settings barely making 20 fps on my old pos and I was happy just to be able to play.
---
For the hoard!
---
RemindMe! 9 days "WE'RE COMING HOME"
---
No it's not after a week those starting zones are easily managed and competition isn't bad at all
---
&gt; Because most of them followed Kael'thas to the Outlands with Illidan.
---
The lore says only 10% of the Blood Elves left with Kael'thas. The remaining 90% stayed in Azeroth.
---
Walk up to a mine scattered throughout azeroth  and right click you do not need a mining pick in modern wow.
---
Hahhhahaha
---
As a warrior tank the worst part of my class is that people will expect perfection from me even if they aren’t perfect.
---
Right and most of the world understands how appalling the "dont like it, leave" crap is. I was never clawing to get in. But hey, at least half your comment is legit.
---
Not needed in retail anymore.
---
Its quite for normal use. It will spin up first login once windows is done loading 5 to 20 secs (depending on how you loaded it up) it will quite down. Under full load it will be audible but not with music playing. 
---
On older games that run like 300 fps it's best to have vsync on. It will just run the gpu at 100% and the fan will a little load at this point
---
Sounds eerily familiar to entry level job requirements.
---
Those idiots, while the most vocal, will be in the minority (I hope)
---

---
Why are you posting a video about fury prot tanking at 60 to talk about leveling from 1-40? what does that have to do with pre level 40 leveling?
---
Can't stand that lying sack of shit.
---
You are presenting the supporting information of your opinion as facts, for example the statement about meta you made.  And as I've said that statement doesn't match reality.  So your opinion and conclusions make sense with your assumptions.  It's just your assumptions that are wrong.
---
There's a pretty big misunderstanding among people on this sub that have only played private servers concerning their impressions of what playing vanilla was like.  They think things are so much more refined and done better but the reality is that the methods aren't really any different.  What's different is the quality and quantity of good information, good tools, that make doing all those things easier. 
---
If you dropped a raider from 2007 into mythic raids today he'd have no problem adjusting because he's seen all the stuff like bloodmallet, simcraft, etc but as shitty sims for a specific class or excel spreadsheets where you had to continually keep downloading the updated version.
---
But the thing is that some gear being good because of its special abilities is an inherent problem to "making gear interesting". Anything that's "interesting" is going to be unbalanced, because of course it is. This is how you get manual crowd pummelers or the +% crit damage suffix on ethnic gear. I think that it might be worth it to reduce esport viability and balance in favor of interesting items. But I'm not sure.
---
This sounds like a challenge.

# &lt;Dark Spirit&gt; [H] [PvP] [NA][US-East] 
---
Seeking to establish a guild that is **fundamentally about PvP**, and **ignores PvE raiding**. Dark Spirit seeks to recruit primarily those interested in Druid, Priest, and Shaman classes of all specs. Ignore raid drama, forget heal-botting, and kick in some alliance teeth. **Rank, not Raid!**
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Servertype**: PVP
---
**Time Zone:** US East (EDT/EST)
---
**Event Time**: Every other day, primetime
---
**Main Classes:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
**Alt Classes:** Any
---
**wPVP &amp; BGs:** Yes
---
**PvE Raiding:** No
---
**Optional Twink Bracket:** 19
---
**Phased Progression**
---
* Phase 1: Core Quests &amp; Dungeons for key equipment quest rewards. Twink prep. wPvP zone control &amp; town raiding.
---
* Phase 2+: sPvP Reputation &amp; Rank 10+ gear progression
---
**Events &amp; Schedule**
---
* Guild event every other day, loosely primetime EST, as strict scheduling is not as necessary as PvE raiding. As such, other NA time zones may not be a problem.
---
* sPvP/BG , wPvP zone/town raid, key quests, etc.
---
**Interested?**

You do realize that a good rogue or fury warrior will add more total dps than a enh shaman right?
---
No don't be worried. Hunters are in the best spot compared to other classes in the beginning, but don't scale as well so fall off. 
---
Even more reason to start off playing Hunter other than leveling like a speed demon.
---
Calm down Satan.
---
Shamans leveling is aids AF. Deep resto for raiding, 30/0/21 for pvp means you are a odd nuker that can also heal but has no mana. 
---
Priest - warlocks and mages taking your spirit gear... its mine darn it. But no really their main issue while leveling is groups not letting you last hit. 
---
For all but troll rogues are very effective verse them in the world.
---
Tip: Don’t let anyone in your group die. Except toxic people.
---
Monkeynews and Skarm for your warrior needs.
---
Ebnflow and Skarm for your druid stuff.
---
Punkrat for the lols.
---
Frostadamus for great all around content.
---
And then they fucked it up with porting stones and flying mounts making the travel a joke anyways. This is why everyone welcomed the full scale dungeon finder in wrath. Might as well port everyone in right away instead of two players fly for 1 minute and port the rest.
---
Meanwhile in Canada...
---
I started at like they very end of Vanillia but wasnt there a version on lfg that was a pop up and showed you who else was looking for a party for that instance? I talked to people a whole lot more with that then anything nowadays the travel time the little race that ensued to the summoning stone(you know some of you did it 🤣) I made more friends with that than anything and built a rep for being reliable. 
---
I'm sorry I'm not a purest like most of this group but where I started is kinda what I have nostalgia for like a lot of these people I wish I had started at launch because of all y'alls stories.
---
Gear score became a thing when ilvl stopped meaning anything. An ilvl 200 in wrath had a different stat budget than another 200 item for the same slit.
---
A Priest will look up at their empty mana bar and shout at me: "Innervate me now!"
---
I will look back at them with disgust, and whisper: "No."
---
We already see that with "LF1M Lock, Pre-BiS only pst!"
---
I wanna add that using something like gearscore wouldn't really measure an item's strength or usefulness because there are items that lack stats or have less armor than others, but have an exceptional on-equip effect or a strong/useful proc effect. Items like [Edgemaster's Handguards](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14551) and [Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9492) come to mind.
---
Well imp totems with 4 warriors is like party wide 27 dps gain. So a joke talent no one should ever get. 
---
Twisting is viable but not very realistic for ele or resto to do (they need their mana). Late game resto maybe able to twist some. But not the entire time.
---
I am not assuming that my assumptions are facts, I've tried to make it clear. And yes private servers were wrong. does that mean the player's attitude and mindset are wrong because a bosses armor value is off? No, I don't think so. Like it or not my point is that the attitude of the players will change for the better isn't wrong. Its an objective inevitability. Even the mindset of the players will change on this version of the game, regardless of how correct it is. Its simply my opinion, and I am not stating it as facts. I was simply trying to state my experience to help further my opinion. Ive probably played with 200 different types of people all with different agendas, and one thing in common with them is that they treated the game different from 2004. My dad played 2004 vanilla and I remember him saying it felt like old school DnD. I'm not quite sure what ur disagreeing with, so its kinda hard to formilute a counter argument.
---
your previous example still uses non 5p SnDs....
---
the rotation should be:
---
:00 - 100e
---
40e - backstab 1cp
---
:02 - 60e
---
0e - backstab 2cp
---
100e - Thistle Tea
---
40e - backstab 3cp
---
:04 - 60e
---
0e - backstab 4cp
---
:06 - 20e
---
:08 - 40e
---
:10 - 60e
---
0e - backstab 5cp
---
:12 - 20e
---
:14 - 40e
---
15e - 5p Slice and Dice 30.45 duration
---
40e - 100% relentless refund
---
:16 - 60e
---
0e - backstab 1cp
---
:18 - 20e

repeat
---
How dare those fans create original fan content for the fandom they're in!!
---
AoE doesn't hit enemy flagged players if you aren't flagged.
---
Even though I always played Horde this is one of my favorite WoW tunes.
---
interesting. Thanks for the write up. Dude's clearly got a point in what he was saying. Funny how explaining things clearly makes a world of difference. Thanks for taking the time to write that up.
---
before anyone thinks this cant be done, just remember...high tier guilds in BC and especially in wrath is where gear score came into effect...Ulduar is the first instance I was personally denied entry into with a couple guilds due to gear score...
---
ONE guild on Area 52 used it in BC during BT and Sunwell....you know them as Vicarious, and they were made notorious by Analogkid and the Sunwell Bow...
---
Same. I get chills and teary eyed every time I watch this. No one seems to talk about it. It came out around the same time as the BFA trailer which had a bunch of reaction videos online, but nothing for this.
---
Don't play
---
Spent $70 last week on a Misty Rainforest.
---
PoE and Grim Dawn
---
I keep seeing all this talk about BiS? WTF is BiS?  Haven't played WoW since like 2011.
---
Bringing up Magic is a valid point. Some of us already have enough stupid hobbies we like to blow our money on. So god forbid some one is hesitant to pick up ANOTHER stupid hobby.
---
Combat is a bit tough to use in PvP. Its strength is sustained damage from white hits. The best tip I can give is to learn what CC moves each class has and do what you can to interrupt or avoid them. Also you should spec for riposte. It's great for leveling and fighting other melee classes.
---
Thanks. What are the negative numbers for on the damage? what is the comparison being made to, for "-430 damage" taken against a horror/elder?
---
Also, to be clear... by standard builds, you mean that the 2 hander is beelining 2h weapon specialization and the fury is beelining dual wield specialization?
---
Oh shit, what a great game. I wish something like speed clears existed in WoW
---
Similar services were banned from eveonline because they made it super easy to launder real money trades.  I seem to remember one of the sites staying up for quite sometime trying to make as a shitty flash casino with their own made up currency that you couldn't buy anything but more roulette spins with.
---
Warlocks are good in dungeons, there are no queues however
---
If this is a "virtual cloud PC" then you'll get banned.  Blizzard doesn't allow it.  Makes me sad, I've been gaming with Shadow Tech the last few months.  Little pricey but OMG does it make all my games look amazing!  I'll have to cancel once Classic drops because...am I really going to be playing anything else?
---
If you find it fun you should play it. If you invest in a guild, in the people in that Guild, be friendly and helpful and contribute even when it does not directly benefit you, you stand a better chance at getting a raiding slot that might otherwise go to a better DPS.
---
Tanks max threat so so fucking quickly now it's not even funny. Full TPS builds are definitely going to be a thing in Classic
---
Yeah so those pieces get high gearscore ratings for classes that use them.
---
The negatives are healing numbers. There are no arms tests before 40, so there's no beelining for 2h weapon spec. And it's not using DW spec since it's following the standard recommendation of 2h fury 1-40 then switch arms.
---
In vanilla there are recipes that take 60 seconds to craft
---
There are just under 350 rares in the non-instanced areas of Azeroth. I was wondering which of those actually drop more than just generic randomly enchanted greens. I found the percent of them that drop loot thats actually unique is very small. And those who's unique loot happen to be blues is even smaller. Heres a video outlining these especially noteworthy mobs its benefits you to be aware of. Hope some of ya'll find this useful.
---
Classic Drakar fuckin up the TRADE chat
---
Items are on screen too quick
---
Of course, people want DPS, the issue is that it is harder to gear up because there are more DPS than people willing to tank or heal. Tanks and healers get groups instantly, DPS not so much, at least that was my experience. Getting into a good guild absolutely helps with this, but just a lonely DPS at lvl 60 may find it hard to get a group.
---
Im 99% sure its bannable.
---
of course mechanic changes change class balance.  have to run more?  classes/specs that do more damage while mobile are better.  boss attacks around itself often?  melee classes are weaker
---
more than twice?
---
your rotation is 11.6 seconds downtime (4 seconds to come online plus 7.6 seconds dropped)
---
mine takes 14 Seconds to come online and never drops
---
how did you arrive at twice?
---
Yeah so you give those pieces scores relative to their power. Its pretty easily done.
---
 **OOMBIDK \[H\] | NA EAST-PvP | semi-hardcore | W/Thurs 8-11 EST**  
---
About:
---
  **&lt;OOMBIDK&gt;** is a guild driven by a group of competent and experienced players that have been crushing content since 2004. We are looking for all roles to fill our ranks early and build from the ground up.  
---
Introduction/Expectations:  Our approach to classic is a semi-hardcore one, where we aspire to be a top guild on whatever server we happen to occupy. We understand the content and what is required to excel in the raiding scene, but are open to tackling it in an enjoyable, yet efficient way. Unorthodox specs that are "viable" are no problem to us so long as you contribute and pull your own. We expect dedicated and skilled raiders, and are open to those that show promise and have a willingness to learn and be knowledgeable. Classic is very much a knowledge intensive game and we expect people to read up and learn/know their class and be prepared with pre-bis gear, consumables, and skill. We expect our members to be team-focused as we are a very group-oriented guild where we want the entire raid team to progress quickly and efficiently, all while having fun and not wasting the time of the entire group.  
---
Socials Welcome:  We also plan to do constant dungeons, BGs , alt runs and whatever other random events aside from raiding and are welcoming anyone who may be interested in those. A primary goal is developing multiple raid teams to have a hospitable environment for players looking to learn and develop, but are not ready to fully commit to the primary team. We're also happy to provide assistance and teach these players that show a willingness to learn. Any and all contributions to the guild will be rewarded.  
---
Preliminary Raid Schedule: W/TH/ 8-11EST, Sunday potentially 8-11EST 
---
Contact: If you are interested please reach one of the following on discord or join our discord: childish#4772 moist#5046 J E R R Y#7628  [https://discord.gg/NAjb83E](https://discord.gg/NAjb83E) 
---
Looking forward to hearing from you!
---
Do you know what's better than watching a video about drops?  Just looking the mob or item up.
---
Not really trying to waste anyones time staring at the items overly long when you can just pause the video tbh.
---
Lol, this
---
Feral was a wonderful tank for 5mans and did pretty decent as a raid off tank too.
---
Because I re-did yours without Thistle Tea.
---
Well, you give me hope
---
Nah, if its low level and good its given a higher score. Addons like this will happen and its good - can see whos put effort into their char.
---
Yeah, the name reservations aren't even in two weeks. Maybe OP is a time traveler.
---
I can't help but feel the classic community is gone - its been over 10 years after all and we've all moved on.  I haven't played myself in a year.  I really dont think classic population will be what you think it will be - i suspect a ton of "Require X Y Z achiv", ridiculous gear scores, etc.  Basically the same asshats that play the current game will play classic as well.  The only interesting thing is, do they continue with TBC / Wraith or do they take the game in another direction?
---
Don't give them ideas
---
It'll be a pizza night for us as well since our fav carry out place is closed mondays. :c
---
Ah damn, I did not even think of that.. I sometimes forget that people will pay real money for in game gold/items to get a leg up.
---
Interesting. I thought Paladin Healers ended up with plate? I've always liked the way Paladin sets looked.
---
OH thank god, I thought you bought a very expensive and used one from eBay with the allowance that your Wife gives you... you have no idea how many men are not allowed to touch their own  money &gt;_&gt;
---
I'm really looking forward to just being accepting/accepted for most dungeons instead of having some arbitrary number besides level to determine if I can do a dungeon
---
How does it compare to something like Dragon Age 1 or 3 or Neverwinter Nights? Those are my favorite single player RPGs and I tend to love anything in that style and Divinity always comes up when I look into games like it. Pillars of Eternity is another one that came up and I tried out and it wasn't too bad.
---
You are amazing! Thank you!
---
What an interesting way to say Alterac.
---
fortnite is a 3rd person shooter with no way to move completely silently and the ability to summon walls at will. it's like as far from what you're describing as it could possibly be.
---
That's pretty much where I'm sitting.  Aside from feeling like I need to concoct a spreadsheet to measure mana efficiency and HPS, it feels like there's a bunch of little things like Rejuvenation not stacking that don't get said. Presumably that applies to Renew as well, but its not the type of thing you'd figure out in a dungeon where you're the only healer, or even UBRS unless you get another healer of the same type and had the foresight to wonder if they stack or not.  Stuff that may be obvious to people who've healed classic, but doesn't end up in a lot of the regurgitated guides.
---
There's a difference between a game going "here this is good" and having to look up the community lore on items.
---
Well, from [this interview](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY) he thinks Thorium Point is probably going to be in phase 1 because its related to MC which is phase 1 content. Raventusk is just a leveling quest hub, which to me makes it just as likely to be in phase 1 as any argument against it being in phase 1 would be the same for thorium point.
---
Pretty much. I'll be happy either way for the same reason.
---
Hopefully its a fluke and not signs of a TBC server re-release.
---
I loved tbc dont get me wrong, but it would completely fracture the classic wow playerbase (and would definetly mean they intend on doing a WOTLK server, which would further fracture the populations)
---
but isrunning does change on beta. Thats the point. Not slowed u can use any ability sin strike hemo hamstring u name it with leeways extra 2.66 yrds. IF you are slowed above 29% you cant use any ability only auto attacks and modifiers work. 
---
On retail where u no longer have the walking trigger from 29%+ slows  U dont lose leeway when slowed above 30% on abilities.
---
I doubt we will ever know one way or another considering blizz hasnt gone into details on it like they have with hit rating and other things.
---
Imo its buged. Just doesnt make sense to me otherwise.
---
Yeah i did get a talk from a GM back in BC for doing this
---
You can argue about a hybrid role being best DPS because that's the exact argument people use against paladins, shamans and druids when they complain about being subpar in classic.
---
While dps and tanking in many cases are more of a route learning thing healing is more of a reacting thing you don't need all those fansy macros/addons what you need is the ability to take in alot of visual information and prioritize your actions. Say for example you know there are big damage incoming and you see a person out of position just toss a shild. There is raid wide damage coming in and one of the dps is not going to survive the next tick cast a fast heal and pray for a critt. Heavy damage is incoming on the tank toss a fast heal to top him up to be able to survive the damage This is the fundamental part in healing. After this comes the ability to judge if your heal will be over healing or not here you kinda want addons to be able to se incoming heals on your target. It is after this things like downranking comes into play. Raiding in classic as a healer might actually be the only thing harder now days the vanilla days. (I still don't  think it is very hard) Ppl tend to bring less healers nowadays. Healing is also about encounter knowledge you need to know what is about to happen getting a addon like deadly boss mod is a good way to start idely you study the fight before hand aswell
---
I've been playing Job Hunter, but I will play Fire Emblem this weekend! Can't wait!
---
Escape from Tarkov
---
Those people just want to be carried lmao.
---
You made me cry
---
Learn to precast and cancel, and batch heals to maximize the 5 second rule.
---
Once you're raiding and have enough +heal to downrank effectively, re-evaluate your goto spells.
---
You should always have a low-value, a mid-value and a high-value heal on your castbar - overhealing is the enemy.
---
How do you determine how powerful an item is? For example, being a level 32 cloth item with decent stats for a caster, the gigaflux reactivator has niche uses like giving additional aoe threat for a tank on 30min cd. How would you go about measuring the item's overall strength into a gs?
---
It’s not. It’s literally you remoting into your own PC at home. Not any different than using like teamviewer.
---
Wouldnt everyone have to be on the same server as well? Also how can u expect people to have 5-10 gold so early in the game?
---
It's almost like different people will be doing different things :o
---
Boomer gamer dads with 6 hours a week to play will have casual fun levelling over a year period and playing in a social fun atmosphere guild
---
Zoomer neets playing 80 hours a week will be capped on three toons by phase 2 and doing 3 split raids + selling double carry dungeon runs
---
And everyone in between
---
You obviously have no clue what I’m talking about. It’s not a virtual cloud server or anything. Blizzard bans people who run their games on virtually hosted computers. This is no different than using teamviewer to your own computer. If you don’t understand the difference than you’re dumb.
---
I think the issue is people are basically biased against the entire idea of using anything sub optimal, even if it will work fine.  Plus it's looking like a large percentage of people will be running warrior and want to shit on on the idea of anything else.
---
Your biggest concern is getting into a competent guild.  Good guilds will only want like 3 hunters.
---
I *do* plan to use consumables, but you're not going to be using tea on every single pull, especially not in the first few seconds of a fight where anything can wrong. That many backstabs in the first seconds of a fight will get you killed. There's no merit in comparing your Tea-rotation against my no-Tea-rotation, the benefit from using it is the same. If I use tea, my SnD downtime shrinks too, making yours still more than double.
---
Lol best post of thread
---
Wow it's almost like MMO's are supposed to be social games where you help each other learn and grow or something... crazy...
---
1st - Alliance is never better, in any situation. FOR THE HORDE
---
2nd - Druids &gt; Paladins
---
3rd - Fury Prot is infact worse than a Feral Druid. People will defend every warrior spec over anythings else because they are kings of hardcore progression. DPS warriors can smash their face on the keyboard and still top DPS. Supply and demand man. Fury warriors will be held to a higher standard than other specs because the market will be saturated with them. Warrior being beaten by a warlock? Kick him and go into /general and get 10 more glue eaters that can do better.
---
I will enjoy being 1 of 10 feral druids playing in Classic and nobody will care about my damage because druids need almost 0 gear from raids until Phase 2 so my lower DPS won't make the rogues cry because they get all that sweet sweet leather gear.
---
Also, ferals might be middle of the pack DPS wise but they still aren't a ret paladin.
---
Is there a version of this that would work like a regular /petattack if you weren’t mousing over anything?
---
Well gearscore sucked imo. It fueled toxicity, bullying, and elitisism in my experience. It works yes, and it's useful, but I don't think it's "good".
---
oh shit, i read this 9 hours ago and didn't consider commenting coz u were already spot on, but to see the parent upvoted and u downvoted makes me really sad. its probably a mirror of this sub, realities get neglected to comfort the feelings of idiots.
---
Why do you care?
---
I’ve never heard it as all-terick. I believe it’s pronounced all-ter-ack. 
---
Cool vid tho.
---
Blizzard clearly does not care about separating classic players from BFA players. Players are players in their eyes and the money is the same so more expansions will keep coming.
---
&gt; elitist - one whose attitudes and beliefs are biased in favor of a socially elite class of people
---
Nope, calling your comments bitchy is not elitist.
---
It’s getting the attention now. Reviews for Shadowbringers are extremely positive and the subscriber base has (based on unofficial censuses) doubled in the past year.
---
I’m looking forward to Classic, but it will he a side game. FFXIV is my game now.
---
In vanilla your best bet was either through Alterac and swim up the lake around Lordaeron, or alternatively get the FP to WPL and run/avoid bears through the Bulwark. 
---
As for level, your mileage may vary. You can wait or if you want, go back repeatedly as you level up and can do arm/cath.
---
With how long it takes to get through each level you will probably find yourself wanting to make multiple trips
---
Besides that assumes you can round up four other people who want to do all of the dungeons
---
they are not only a good role to have, they are essential for every successful guild.

Realistically, you cannot expect most people to want to play vanilla over and over forever. Some pirate server players want to do that, and more power to them, but they can't make everyone else stay and play with them. Eventually people will leave, either for TBC if it is available or just to play some other game they have not played to death.
---
Blizzard doesn't owe it to you to force its customers to play the game you like, instead of the game they want to play.
---
After knowing how it ends, why rewatch GoT? You sound like you'd like playing druid if you like self punishment like that
---
\&gt; Well the point of a video isn't to be a bunch of pictures that I have to keep pausing to look at, so you're losing the whole point of even having a *video*. 
---
Idk why youre going so out of your way to shit on my video when you clearly havnt even watched it. Its not a bunch of pictures in video format? Nor is it "just not" useful because you have to pause the video if you want to look at a particular item longer than its presented. 
---
The whole point of the video is so that youre aware of certain mobs existence so that you have a better chance of finding them in the first place. Your chances of just stumbling upon them are astronomically lower.
---
Lol I don’t know if that’s a very fair comparison
---
:cough: druid main since the start of vanilla, and yes, i've considered therapy
---
A week after name reservations is a week before release.
---
Paladin tier gear is mediocre for healing until T3. Until Naxx your bis will be a robe.
---
You'll be out leveling previous dungeons by 30 so you'll probably want to run SM as you level through the 30s. As far as getting there you'll head to hillsbrad then head north, preferably with a group. You can cut across the pond and west of UC, not sure if the shortcut would still work.
---
they are obsolete in retail, but vanilla is not only a different game, but a different genre. let the retailers be loud, but don't listen to them.
---
Are all of these weird BiS things obvious, like +skill items in Diablo-likes, or should I look at a spreadsheet for 'em while leveling?
---
Don't /s me young man
---
&gt;  Your chances of just stumbling upon them are astronomically lower.
---
This is only true for things like the naga way out in the water that drops the stun trinket, which I actually did discover without looking up.
---
It's not useful to me, I'll just leave it at that.
---
Because Classic's success, as with Vanilla's, has the potential to turn some (corporate) heads and redefine the genre once again. This could lead to future changes in game design philosophy and Blizzard getting back on track, despite Activision's leadership.
---
You should definitely have a BIS list for your class bookmarked just so you can keep your eye out
---
lmao
---
The money is not the same. Retail players are worth 2-3 times more revenue than Classic players.
---
This should already work that way.
---
[@mouseover,harm]  = If you have a mouseover target that is an enemy, issue the pet attack command on that target.
---
[] = Always evaluates to true, issue pet attack command (will just silently fail if you have no target since pet attack requires one)

The macro system goes through each condition and executes the first one that is true.

$15 a month subscription fee is what I'm referring to.

thistle tea does not cause GCD. very possible to do backstab, thistle tea, backstab, between energy ticks. just confirmed on a 1.12 client
---
also please stop using 110 energy. p2 BIS is 4/8 tier 1
---
The thing is, I believe having a feral is optimal.
---
&gt; Arena has better rewards than BGs
---
and i prefer it that way. Anyone can join a BG and semi-afk for free gear. Arena's are also more challenging then BG's, despite RBG's existing for a long time now Arena's are still where it's at for the highest lvl of skill.
---
So why should BG's give better rewards then arena? Or even equal at that matter. It evolves into the same issue with Live where people just do heroic only because eventually they just get lucky enough to where their gear is equally as good as mythic.
---
Of course. And that has no effect on whether or not BFA stands a chance.
---
Mostly just the AH
---
Best in slot
---
The only thing I'd add would be the accelerated leveling and reputation gains from 1-60.
---
Spriest isn't really an outlast spec because they have mana issues.
---
I can describe something in words and you can know it's *not for you* without wasting your time investigating it yourself.
---
"Being locked in a barrel full of scorpions sucks!"
---
You don't have to actually experience being locked in a barrel full of scorpions yourself to know it isn't going to be something you want to enjoy.
---
in what world is fury prot worse than a feral druid
---
Yeah that's true.  Item level was a hidden stat until Wrath I think.  It didn't actually show up on items in game.  You had to have an addon to view it or look it up online.  Probably like 99% of playerbase didn't even know item level existed in classic lol.
---
No, if you're specced Combat the ACLG are not BIS.
---
And Thistle Tea might not cause a GCD on a Private Server, but it definitely did in the Beta.
---
I think the community would love it.
---
No one cares if the fights are the same. No one is playing vanilla to do the exact same fights thats absolutley not the point.

Fantastic platformer, beautiful; it's a metroidvania.

You implied that people without GEDs cant hold down jobs where "$10 isnt a lot". First and foremost, the context of that doesnt even apply to me. Cause I have both.
---
And 2nd, theres plenty of folk without GEDs that are smart and hold down better jobs than everyone in this God forsaken subreddit.

It will be a matter of weeks before someone makes that addon and it turns into wotlk all over again.
---
Unfortunately some tryhard is going to start egating people, it always happens anymore lol.
---
There are a few downsides of rogue PVP but I'll just mention the one I personally found the most infuriating. Vanish was not consistent/reliable in the way it worked in early iterations of the game and you'd often be brought out of stealth immediately after using it even with no DoT's on you (probably due to how spell batching works?). Also, sometimes a pet wouldn't de-aggro immediately after using vanish and bring you back out of stealth. I can't remember exactly when it was, but later in TBC or WotLK that they added a split second immunity after using vanish in order to better deal with the inconsistency.
---
You know, I was happy to have this discussion with you and answer your questions, but since you're constantly adding "thanks but no thanks, you don't know anything" after every comment, I've decided you can fuck off and be an inferior rogue. Do the math yourself kid.
---
Paint both houses but my grandma is getting her knee replaced on aug 27th :c

Good, gotta filter out the shitters expecting a carry somehow
---
Don't worry. I am 41 and got watery eyed. I cannot wait to get back into wow.
---
Literally why I quit playing my Shaman a month into being level 60.
---
Music is from Ori and the Blind forest.
---
Fantastic platformer; and yes it's the reason you're tearing up. the whole game is just as beautiful.
---
To be fair, its often much easier to maintain a single good 2-hander over two good 1-handers while leveling.
---
The link goes to a useful list of BiS items as well as some other information. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761)

And what do you do from AQ on when you get one shot
---
Re Thistle GCD:  
---
i didnt have beta access but sounds like you did. do you have any video or logs of this? i cant speak to how it happened on the beta but i do know this is how i would use tea back in 2005 and not stutter Energy ticks. so if you could please help us all out and provide evidence we can get it submitted to blizz and have this bug fixed
---
Not the flask
---
You don't get 1 shit.  You get a shit load of gear in aq40.  You are a better tank walking into naxx than the warrior.
---
The craving for quick and efficient progression will soon take over the craving for nostalgia.
---
If GS isn't in game it will be an addon I imagine.
---
That comparison is absurd. Whatever man.
---
I stand by what I said, I know how the traffic flows.
---
Speak for yourself. I was 11 and running around tanaris on my level 23 dwarf Hunter.
---
Hey, as a rogue main I would really like to pick your brain about why ACLG are not bis as combat daggers! It seems like a pretty easy go-to bis but I wonder what your reasoning is.
---
It was fine in TBC with improved one.
---
Definitely no. [This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=rogue&amp;t=tktRtmtwtvtitNtOtPtQvdtntVtotWtdtFtGtHtItXtjtJtKtLtMC0C1C2JTtpuIuJuKuLuMuXuYuZuQuRu9uDuEuFuGuHtZt0t1t2) is how you should be leveling.

Fire Emblem Three Houses as of Friday

This is reassuring. I don’t have a problem using my class for the groups benefit but there are lines

Wow, this is actually kind of solid.
---
Buy a used business class laptop on ebay for about $200.  Dell Precision, HP zbook or ELiteBook etc.  Those things are gonna have 100x better build quality than that amazon one, and you can get one with a dedicated gpu still for about $200.  generally better IPS screens and keyboards too.

Only works if you macro a weapon that doesn't have poison on it, otherwise you have a strong chance of breaking the Sap.
---
Note for those new to engineering: the version of gnomish death ray in classic will likely not hit this hard. it was nerfed back in vanilla.

This advice needs more Upvotes. This general concept not only works in WoW, but with most things in life.

Half way through wotlk? No way dude.

Really?  I trained it on my mage at level 5 by walking to Undercity.
---
Great feedback, thanks a lot man. :)
---
Ok, you're flagged when entering an enemy city. But does you get flagged when on a zone controlled by the opposite faction? If not, that's another difference from PvE to PvP.
---
Mostly playing Legion.
---
players choose where to tank lucifron your hypothetical doesn't even make sense.  your different mechanics like you mention 100% change class balance for the reasons I mentioned.
---
depends on the class and spec, really. in this situation for example good luck telling which of your pala healers has the 5% crit talent and which doesn't, none of them are ever going oom anyway
---
Yea with CDs rogues can kill alot of things before they even get a hit in, they are the masters of the burst, but anything with a big enough HP pool to last through the burst becomes a serious problem versus a slower but more sustainable option like a Prot Pally

Went to WalMart today. The prominent WoW box on the shelf had this blood elf girl art across the front. Not sure why, it was for retail WoW. Maybe it's just someone in marketing really likes this picture.
---
Yea, people can play the game however they want. I was asking how do you go about scoring items when there are many in classic that ,while having odd itemizations, can be good or bad?
---
I do see your point though, someone is more than likely thinking that GS would matter for quick effective progression. When reality skill will take a character way further then GS in classic.
---
Yeah but you also think $15 a month is too much, when you probably spent 3x that amount on hand lotion and Kleenex.
---
I was expecting maturity and civility. I guess you havnt learned that locked away in your moms basement playing the greatest game ever made.
---
First day is always attendance too.  Don’t show up, get dropped.  At least that’s how my undergrad was
---
It´s worth it, at least to me, apparently not to you, so don´t do it.
---
Coming to Reddit and expecting people to be civil and mature in response to your stupid thread is a very tall order.
---
only time I ever played a rogue was I dueled using my friends during wotlk and idk if it was different at that time or if I mainhanded crippling or not but cheapshot was definitely either not proccing poisons or i was mainhanding crippling.
---
Yeah but this poster specifically mentioned combat with pvp in mind. 
---
Also the new meta does recommend 2 points in remorseless when leveling because it benefits you on chain killing. Depending on how up to date you are casually keeping a dagger, and your latest spell of ambush, some rogues recommend opening with a remorseless ambush and then weapon swapping to sword for sinister strike spam.
---
I feel GS would primarily be used by tryhard groups that aren't really that great.
---
I was 11 when i played classic, and that was only for like a month or two before bc came out. So I really don't know what I'm talking about.
---
the data's generally just too noisy to pick that kind of thing out in my experience. all kinds of things happen during raids which leads to a lot of variance in the metrics.
---
Cannot get upvoted enough tbh.

"Vanilla trees give so much more room for customization!"

---
*Rolls rogue/lock/hunter after his 5th group rejection in a row because "lol, holy wanding might get you some better dps bro"*
---
Was it the content like MC people prefer though? MC itself is horrible, raid design was much better later. Obviously I can’t speak for 100% of the people, but most people I hear/read about the sense of community, that it’s a loving world and that it’s a dangerous world out there. Retail you sit in a hub and fly or teleport so they make these artificial places where you are forced to fight the other faction, in Vanilla that was Felwood, EPL, later Silithus, etc, all part of the real world. 
---
Does anyone miss MC itself (and all that red), or do they miss raiding MC with their friends?
---
I think blizzard as a whole is still very out of touch with it's community and that leads to making bad decisions

The only credit that '*these people'* can claim is the start of the campaign to collect signatures because a company definitely cares about 300.000+ potential customers telling them 'we want that'
---
I'm assuming this is meant for PvP/duels, in which the spec you linked is fine. You could also go for a siphon life and nightfall variation:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRboZcxVzRZVxbz
---
Too much in the sense of it not being worth that much if you wont be playing the current patch. I'm sorry your feeble little mind is struggling to comprehend such simplicity.
---
You don't respec, you just cast frostbite on bosses that are immune or highly resistant to fire.
---
Respecing to farm also enables you to be frost.  Maybe you can use that.
---
Not if you go to a wow-only streamer server.
---
Whatever server asmon goes to will 100% be the best experience you can get with wow, since it'll always be active and probably have lots of fun community events.
---
I hope you get high enough level to play BRD then and enjoy the wonders of that dungeon 😊

J Allen brack would rather say I told you so than have a succesful career

Son I could afford a $15 a month BJ from your mama if I felt she was worth it.
---
I'm pretty sure you can cast teleport moonglade again to get back to where you came from, right?
---
I believe this to, but other comments and the down votes may say otherwise. While I accept the position I just don’t understand it.
---
Dude 15 bucks a month is cheap. If your financial situation is such that you think otherwise, playing wow for potentially hundreds of hours shouldn't be a priority.
---
Something being "worth it" is completely subjective. Don't try to act intelligent, it's cringey.

---
*  Doesn’t block or parry so more damage is taken by default
---
*     Can’t push crushes off the hit table and generally has low amounts of defense so can be crit (this is offset by more armor mitigation making it less potent)
---
*     No situational spells so not able to substitute as MT for encounters that require it
---
*     Not able to transition to an MT position for temporary or permanent guild needs
---
*     Can’t drink potions or eat healthstones while in form
---
*     Can’t drink rage pots for extra initial rage (though this has not seemed to affect me negatively ever)
---
*     Bad at aoe tanking
---
*     Can’t stance dance for fear mechanics (this is much less of an issue for Alliance druids)
---
*     Not able to talent to get 2 seconds shorter cooldown for Taunt
---
*     No secondary taunt ability (Mocking Blow)
---
*     Not able to disarm
---
*     Not able to silence if mob is immune to stuns (often)
---
*     Sometimes can’t battle rez because actively tanking
---
*     Sometimes can’t innervate because actively tanking
---
*     Would never be able to provide the Thunderfury debuff (if the guild was lucky enough to have more than two)
---
*  Can't use sapper charges
---
*  Can't use force reactive shield
---
Honestly the no changes crowd suck. The game would be objectivley better with some new mechanics and new fresh fights. Even in retail the raids on mythic are extremely tough. Theyd have no issue re designing fights for classic. Id love to see it personally.
---
You're how old, and the best you could come up with is a "your mama" joke? You're pathetic dude
---
Yeah, that guys really hate money.
---
Yeah I agree I feel like it will take a fat while for even the hardcore guilds to be geared enough to clear rag
---
Yea, that’s my position too. You can look at the lists if you want. But especially pre 60 it allows for a lot of thought to go into it.
---
Hey, I was in &lt;M E R C I L E S S&gt;

Throwing money away for the sake of spite is one of the advantages of being obscenely wealthy.

2x 27" 1440p 144hz Master Race!
---
Ah, thank you!
---
ActiBlizzard don't consider classic a major release it was completely skipped over in recent earnings calls so if they don't see it as a major release they won't spend money advertising. All we can do is spread the word and prove them wrong sadly that is also us doing their job for free.
---
Because itemization is wanky as hell. More than often blue items are better than epics or the tier sets.
---
I saw where someone was upset that you could mail multiple items without an addon in Beta. You just have to shake your head at that point, they just want to fight to fight at that point. 
---
That’s official wow forums kind of crap.
---
Everyone must seem elitiest when you're a dumbass tbh

I wish I could downvote you more.

Exactly lol.

People DO use them though, and they're fine.
---
I feel sorry for you. Enjoy classic, we all know you'll play it when it comes out regardless of the cost
---
Who? I’ve played vanilla a long time now and haven’t seen a guild thats cleared naxx who has used a feral

The greater wand at lv70 enchanting is very good. I wouldn't drop enchanting until you make that

Dark Cloud 2. Hoping to force a career shift. Might stop going into work lol
---
I stopped playing for like 4 months after raiding hard during Wrath. I came back and GS had become a thing. I got denied a spot in Sarth +3 even though I had an achievement for doing it that was over a year old.
---
I actually haven't played either of those two but I can personally say it has me invested and a game hasn't done that to me in a while since the witcher 3. Every character/ npc has spoken dialogue so it really breathes life into the game world. I have been playing it with my girlfriend and it really adds to the rpg aspect.
---
As a rogue I Thankyou for your time and effort
---
That is a long ass run without a mount.
---
The tank pulls the boss, hits it with one sunder in defensive stance. His sunder generates additional threat because of the threat modifier from defensive stance. The other four warriors do one sunder each from any stance that isn't defensive stance.
---
In order to pull aggro from the main target you need to exceed the main target's threat by 110% if you're melee or 130% if you're ranged. It doesn't matter that sunder is a high threat ability so long as you only apply it once. Especially when the tank's second and third GCD are an immediate shield slam/revenge combo.
---
The build you have there will be pretty decent for leveling in the world and ok for pvp. In dungeons you’ll be fine but probably won’t be top dps and endgame raids aren’t gonna be very accepting of it.
---
And shrinks the world
---
A lot of people love mana burn. I honestly didn't find it THAT useful as shadow, it was MUCH better as disc. PI yourself and mana burn the crap out of shadow priests too, there's not much they can do to you as a disc priest.  If you want to heal as well as be offensive, disc priest is amazing for that.
---
Holy shit, you hate feral druids.  Lol

Multishot is a legit part of hunter dps in classic on single targets.

tens of millions? nah man... I'm not asking for massive posters or tv spots, literally just a picture on facebook or twitter, it doesn't cost them anything.
---
All you have to do is check the amount of advertising, their proposed layering plan, no rp servers and that blizzard planned to release non-language centralised servers. Blizzard thinks classicwow will die/fail.
---
That girls voice is very off like a french Canadian with a lisp

Tanks that want to pvp are screwed unless they tank in pvp spec

I replied all day to you and once you devolved into nonsense saying I didn't play classic I knew I was talking to a turbo nerd and it was going nowhere. Now I'm just laughing at you as you grasp at straws and rage. Seeing as you keep responding with nuh uh comments you're clearly the salty one. Go roll on a steak
---
You'll find a way, and you'll be playing come August. I guarantee it
---
Taladris sums it up well - anyone thats been playing vanilla at any point since launch knows they are suboptimal. Taladris *sortof* makes it work by being the literal best feral druid in the world.
---
It doesn't give threat to other players, but having five sunders on the boss as soon as possible is a major net raid dps increase. The point is that sunder armor is not an amazing tps ability to use, so having dps warriors handle that lets the tank focus on actually holding aggro instead.
---
I'd leave if I was objectively wrong and incapable of arguing as well.  Have a nice day friendo
---
God I hope GS isn't a think when vanilla launches
---
I’ve talked to people I hadn’t heard from in 10+ years all wanting to play again. The word is definitely out there as these were all people who quit before WotLK. 
---
It’s a different target audience, they are pitching to the BFA player base (it’s in the Launcher) and word spread to old players after Blizzcon. 
---
Ironically enough, in most cases due to the friendships people developed with their guildies in Vanilla. All it took was one or two to hear about it then emails and texts did the rest.
---
Shields don't generate rage when they have shield cast on them
---
Started out with ESO until the daily focused gameplay lost me. 
---
Started playing Outward a little while ago, most fun I've had in an RPG in a long time. A lot of quests have different outcomes ranging from you fucked up now this guy you needed help from wants to kill you to you did awesome this guy will help you and give you items and/or a permanent stat boost. I managed to lose my starting city after holding off on a difficult quest, the whole zone is a bitch to traverse now because I have nowhere to go to get food, rest or heat up when its winter time in the zone.
---
Meh, fuck a movie, give me an Amazon or Netflix series.
---
The hubris in that line oozes out from him. It was a really disrespectful and dismissive way to talk to fans.
---
It works when the raid uses the advantages provided by having a feral. If you just go feral like an idiot and you or the raid isn't taking advantage then yeah it's suboptimal
---
Wealthy, and extremely stupid.
---
Isn't there a flight path not too far south of Andorhal?
---
Nope, changes means it's not classic.  Plain and simple.  If you want a new raid with different mechanics, there are other expansions/mmo's.  We're all playing this to go back to the original.
---
Bite has slightly less dps,but its far more efficient.  I prefer bite + growl vs claw spam.
---
Druid is the king of self sufficiency. They have cc, heals, tank, dps, stealth, teleport Moonglade (fly to major cities) and more all at the same time. Need a heal? Healing Touch Boom. Need someone to tank? Bear Boom. Need to get away? Travel Form/Root Boom. Need to afk? Stealth Boom. Need dps? Kitty Boom. Need to get back to town? Teleport Moonglade FP Boom. The only thing they can't do is cleanse.
---
Wouldn't say everyone at Blizzard, but the people running the show definitely seems to. Makes sense considering J Allen Brack is the president/CEO/whatever of Blizzard, made a fool of himself and probably wants to prove himself right, sad for him to let his ego get in the way if that's the case. The fact that J Allen Brack got that position says a lot about the leadership structure in Activision though, hes got very few good things on his resume when it comes to games but hes a good business man, or would be if it wasn't for his ego at least in this case.

Neutral capitals also sick. Especially if you then divide go and divide the players in two factions on their own factions.
---
lawbringer isn’t perfectly itemized but it’s still pretty good. perhaps not bis, but good enough. there’s a bunch of fully serviceable healer plate in ZG and AQ as well. T2 is definitely mediocre for heals though
---
You have that backwards. Is the dps warrior allowed to roll against the main tank? Typically? No. You always gear your tank first. In some situations, if it’s a nominal upgrade for your tank but a large upgrade for your very reliable dps, maybe they’ll win.
---
&lt;Midnighters&gt; is looking for players to come own with us.
---
NA|PvP|Horde|PST
---
Raid times:
---
Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST
---
Tue a possible 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content.
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community. 
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message. 
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.
---
Current Class Needs:
---
No longer recruiting for raid spots.  Casual/PVP are free to apply and join.
---
Contact Warehouse (Discord: Warehouse#9453) Or, you can head to  https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters and  apply!
---
Because people like the tank need gear way more than DPS. FOr example casters could be naked and do fine on rag, but your tank needs to be the best geared one there
---
Maintaining your morals is super hard as a rogue. You will always be tempted to steal mining nodes because it's so easy for rogues to manipulate their surroundings
---
Except if they release TBC its just repeating history. Afterall where do they stop? what happens when people want to re-play the old game they loved, and suddenly we are on "Classic Mists of Pandaria"
---
In an ideal world  i'd love to see them go the path of Runescape, developing the game with classic ideology and branching it off away from "modern" wow, but I don't think modern blizzard is remotely trustworthy enough to design new content that wouldn't compromise what made classic amazing in the first place. 
---
Therefore, I think Classic wow should be a time capsule for those who wish to re-live the game as it was (Isnt that the entire point in the first place, to re-play the game before they destroyed it with modern design), accepting that people will eventually defeat everything and move on to the next adventure, yet leaving it preserved for those who never had a chance to experience it before, or wish to do so whenever they want?
---
Best thing is to find raids earlier like pugs to help summon for tips.
---
Human male warrior is the chad combo
---
you will get eaten by rabies bears/spiders and then again at the undead checkpoint into tirisfal. guaranteed death time loss
---
Well it looks like your comment pulled me out of the depths or something lol.
---
I felt like I was saying something pretty obvious and intuitive, but who knows.
---
For any given individual in a raid the optimal healing is to put out as much healing as you possibly can without going oom, overhealing be damned. From there it's a matter of your raid leader tuning the raid composition to have the minimum number of healers it can while still preventing deaths.
---
because the people that are there for progression wipes might deserve gear more than the guy there for the first time
---
Go all in. No CGI all practical effects!
---
“We’re all” isn’t accurate, quite a lot of people would be thrilled with new content. 
---
Let’s face it, there are already a shitload of changes in Classic.  New macro system, 1.12 itemization at launch, 16 debuff slots, etc., so you are getting changed whether you like it or not. 
---
You need a better answer than “no changes” because that horse is already out of the barn. “No, I like the old MC” works fine and, while I disagree, is a valid answer.
---
Cancel the other 4 subs and use that money to buy gold.
---
I played in this guild, but I barely remember it. I was a NE warrior named Vladek
---
Yes that's another grate use of the spell
---
Goodluck trying to police speech on the internet. Just come to terms that people will say terrible shit it is what it is.
---
Not gonna stop it.
---
I mean compared to most games it's pretty simplistic. You just go around leveling skills, doing quests, whatever you want really. Combat (at low levels anyway) is basically click on the monster and wait
---
The lack of decent rewards is a big hurdle
---
Priority /roll solves this. If an item drops in MC that is BiS for a rogue but is replaced for a hunter in BWL the hunter would not be allowed to roll until the rogues all have the item.
---
Because by definition rolling randomly rewards people, and doesn't take merit into account.  That's fine for your PUGs and super casual guilds.  But you make damn sure the people who show up for the raids on a consistent basis with consumables and a real spec are the ones that get rewarded.  Also you want to make sure your most active tanks have the gear to tank whatever is next in your progression.
---
It was used in the majority of guilds in wow.  DKP and LC were minority loot concepts in the Elite and "wannabe" elite groups.  
---
There were always exceptions made depending on pugs, specific items for specific rolls "ie tanks/heals" but anyone who says alternate programs were the status quo is just ignorant.  
---
You also have a collection of want-to-be elitist twats on this Reddit as well who will tell you repeatedly that you must be this spec with this race and join a DKP guild or you suck at wow.  
---
Don't worry, this community does not reflect the actual player base.
---
My tip would be only get Blacksmithing, if you can get the patterns that drop for the guild. Otherwise i would stick to eengineering for pvp and sappers
---
Other than that warrior is a fun class but it kinda depend on other to get full potential. But rogue and warlock is good classes for playing solo.
---
If it's a one-hander by leveling it's a free-for-all. If it's a two-hander, yeah, as leveling I will give preference to the DPS always
---
Im sure
---
Yeah that makes sense. Guess I’m just saying having a gaming mouse with buttons, semi mechanical keyboard and a 24 inch monitor we’re all things I never had in vanilla haha they cost me but they bring value to this game and just daily computer use. I think it’s 100% worth looking into those items that could have in game if you can’t afford a brand new pc
---
Mostly because I would not want to get a reputation as that tank who rolls on DPS items
---
I always do for that reason lol. I do get into groups after not long too.
---
Note: I'm pre-including Blessing of Kings in these lists.
---
As Combat Daggers, ACLG give you:
---
* 1% hit
---
* 10% damage on Glancing Blows
---
* 1.2% crit
---
* 16 AP
---
In comparison, Nightslayer Gloves give you:
---
* 0.68% crit
---
* 33 AP
---
* 10 maximum Energy
---
Base stats:
---
* 4.93% crit (not to be confused with base crit, we'll get to that soon)
---
* 231 AP
---
From the rest of your gear you're looking at:
---
* 7% hit
---
* 17.29% crit
---
* 467 AP
---
From talents:
---
* 8.5% hit
---
* 10.2% crit
---
* 20% damage on Glancing Blows 
---
With these buffs:
---
* 231 Attack Power (talented Battle Shout)
---
* 222 Attack Power (talented Greater Blessing of Might)
---
* 100 Attack Power (Trueshot Aura)
---
* 18 All Stats (talented Gift of the Wild)
---
Against a a level 63 mob:
---
* 4.4% crit (this is your base at 300 weapon skill, we've included the bonus from talents and ACLG in their sections)
---
* 6% reduction in crit chance (3% from stats, 3% from auras)
---
* 32% miss chance (this does not include bonuses from weapon skill but is calculated without the &gt;10 penalty)
---
* ~35% damage reduction from armor (after debuffs)
---
* 40% of all white attacks will be Glancing Blows at 65% regular damage
---
You arrive at:
---
* 16.5% hit
---
* 32.64% or 32.12% crit
---
* 1303 or 1320 AP
---
* 5% or 15% Glancing Blow reduction
---
* 100 or 110 maximum Energy
---
So let's do some math:
---
Perdition's Blade: 105 + AP / 14 * 1.8 raw damage
---
* ACLG = 273
---
* NSG = 275
---
Core Hound Tooth: 82 + AP / 14 * 1.6 raw damage
---
* ACLG = 231
---
* NSG = 233
---
Instant Poison: 130 * 0.2 = ~26 damage per hit
---
Perdition's Blade after GB+Hit+Crit+Poison:
---
* ACLG = 0.845 * [273 * 0.4 * 0.95 + 273 * 0.2736 + 273 * 2 * 0.3264] * 0.65 + 26 = ~222 damage per hit
---
* NSG = 0.845 * [275 * 0.4 * 0.85 + 275 * 0.2788 + 275 * 2 * 0.3212] * 0.65 + 26 = ~217 damage per hit
---
Core Hound Tooth after GB+Hit+Crit+Poison:
---
* ACLG = 0.845 * [231 * 0.4 * 0.95 + 231 * 0.2736 + 231 * 2 * 0.3264] * 0.65 + 26 = ~192 damage per hit
---
* NSG = 0.845 * [233 * 0.4 * 0.85 + 233 * 0.2788 + 233 * 2 * 0.3212] * 0.65 + 26 = ~187 damage per hit
---
Hand of Justice is a 2% chance at an extra MH swing, so that's an extra ~4 damage per hit for either set of gear.
---
Backstab:
---
* ACLG = 1.2 * [(273 * 1.5 + 210) * 2.24 * 0.6264 + (273 * 1.5 + 210) *  0.3736] * 0.65 + 26 = ~885 damage
---
* NSG = 1.2 * [(275 * 1.5 + 210) * 2.24 * 0.6212 + (275 * 1.5 + 210) *  0.3788] * 0.65 + 26 = ~886 damage
---
5pt Eviscerate:
---
* ACLG = (958 + 1303 * 5 * 0.03) * 2 * 0.3264 + (958 + 1303 * 5 * 0.03) * 0.6736 = ~1530 damage
---
* NSG = (958 + 1320 * 5 * 0.03) * 2 * 0.3212 + (958 + 1320 * 5 * 0.03) * 0.6788 = ~1527 damage
---
So as you can see, the ability damage is a wash and the white attack damage is no more than 6 DPS.
---
If the story stopped there, then yes, ACLG would be *slightly* better, but we need to discuss the +10 maximum Energy as this is the entire reason to wear NSG over ACLG.
---
At 110 Energy you can open with Garrote (50 Energy) and then Backstab (60 Energy) right after the GCD, leaving you with a perfect time to Thistle Tea for maximum effect and the quickest SnD uptime at 3:00.
---
At 100 Energy, you open with Garrote (50 Energy) but can't Backstab (60 Energy) until your first Energy tick at 2:00, leaving you with 10 Energy, wasting 10% of the Thistle Tea, and being half a second slower on SnD.
---
So are NSG better than ACLG? Well, it can be a matter of opinion, but in theory, yes. The extra 10 Energy certainly makes up for the ~6 DPS in *most* fights and surpasses it in some.
---
who the fuck would want netflix to butcher another franchise
---
Apparently I had actually forgotten to put the price in that comment originally, that was the main point. A little over $300 will get anyone a PC strong enough to run Classic extremely well.
---
Itemization homogenization
---
you have literally no competition for feral tank gear so you can soak up all of it. your rogues are competing with you for cat gear though, and you’re the absolute lowest priority there
---
Let's hope we're right and they're wrong
---
I changed jobs, and booked a week off for launch. Planning to speedrun to 60 over the week 👍
---
Hello. I joined your discord. User name Boiledtoast. 
---
Planning on playing dwarf Priest. Older player(38). Shouldn’t have a problem making raid times. 
---
At launch, how will everyone know what server to join?  Thanks.
---
aw man, I guess that makes sense, I didn’t realize that Locks just kept them in Phase Shift.  It makes sense, but what a bummer!
---
I still think it's dumb Classic isn't even getting it's own tab on the Battle Net client. It's going to be under that drop down menu that you access the PTR with.
---
What? Misusing trade chat?
---
This.  Advertising is really expensive and I don't think the random casual gamer is going to be enticed by something that's not even a remaster.  Only way the game survives is if after the massive departure a couple months in, game stabilizes and grows from there.
---
If it means anything, I know some very successful people that have DUI’s and say it is the moment that changed their life/ attitude!
---
Playing Classic and Retail costs the same, but Classic players are not going to buy the mount etc.
---
TF goes to mt.  Hand of rag goes to shaman/paladin.  Other 2h are offspec items.  
---
For leveling, it does not matter.  Take what you need to level.
---
Lol the classic team is like 10/15 people, the team it took to make vanilla was 60 people 80hours a week over 6 years and hundreds   on expensions
---
\+Servers were sooo much more expensive back then, like probably at least x20 more expensive
---
Nope.  I quit a couple months after Cata and haven't been back.  Was going to resist Classic too, but a lot of friends I used to play with are coming back, so I got roped in.
---
Do they not see the faults in the Quick Cash grab of someone who won't stick around compared to just making a good game people want to stay consistently around for?
---
Before you would actually cast your abilities to level so mana usage was higher.  Now you mind blast, swp, and wand tossing shield on yourself.  While wanding you will have your mana regen going typically being close to full mana after fight w/out spirit tap.  On a pve server your free to cast more w/out worry of being ganked so it's more useful.
---
Someone watched a video on YouTube today.
---
I'm talking about a world where you use growl enough times so that after you stop using it you still won't pull threat. If the mob is at 5% and your pet uses growl instead of claw because you have it set to auto cast that is a waste of focus and missed damage.
---
I personally would level with growl set to autocast because I'm nottrying to minmax my leveling experience to that degree. Just because the difference might seem negligible to you doesn't make the people that are making the claim or using the strategy wrong. Having growl set to auto cast will result in your pet using growl when it isn't an optimal usage of focus.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1131/totem-of-infliction#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1131/totem-of-infliction#comments)   Alliance only feral tank offhand. Other option is +8 all stats. Procs in bear.
---
Duh, johnnynewrogue, because according to this sub the other guy is in the wrong for playing a hunter past lvl 59.
---
[Smart, unless said rave ends up being a vampiric blood-orgy.](https://youtu.be/gHBhKbF2xMA)
---
Exactly
---
Speaking from experience on that one lmao
---
59 seconds is more than enough time to read this and comment that it's stupid.
---
You are entitled to you unreasonably stupid opinion but please keep it away from a forum that dedicated to keeping the WoW classic experience authentic to what it was in 2006. Bye
---
Don't heal dps standing in fire and dumbass warriors trying to tank without a shield.
---
No worries I read it, the contents of this post are even dumber than the title.
---
Is there another wow episode planned for sp?
---
If you post about it, believe in it, maybe I feel like it makes way to much sense and my understanding was that was a very popular episode and the creators knew what wow was and were playing. Hopefully some are still around
---
Imagine the trade chat spam &gt;.&gt;
---
lol
---
Using some dude with an opinion off of a subreddit is also a fucking bad sample.
---
  No, and there won’t be one(I’ll gladly eat some edible underwear off my fuck buddy if I’m wrong).
---
Considering that a private server like Nost got over 150,000 account creations, and me, a WoW lover never heard about it, I'm not so sure about your prediction. Again, a single server got that many account creations, I really think Classic is going to blow some people away by how popular it will be.

Warframes trade chat comes to mind for some reason while thinking about this. They have trade. Region. And global all separated and trade moves so quick you can't read it.
---
After a while you avoid that by having a big friend list filled with competent and friendly players. That's how I did all my dungeons, a mix between guild mates and people from the friend list.
---
Most important thing is to stand out from the crowd. Best way to do that is to get to 60 quick, and be geared quick.   After that, you are set for life.  Like being born a rich kid. You cannot fail.
---
Alts, other games (CS: Source alot and also Oblivion) and a little bit of college life are the reasons I never made it to 60 until 2 weeks before TBC launched. I plan to main something, probably a warrior, this time and stick it out to the endgame!
---
Someone hasn't kept up with the meta. Dual-wielding Fury tanks are absolutely possible and even preferred once your healers have the gear to sustain them.
---
**This belongs on /r/classicwowplus.**
---
It’s a horrible idea. Vanilla already had unlinked auction houses.  
---
  
---
Players already do this by spamming trade/local channels. The linked AH system is the Ronco set it and forget it method of trade. Tradeskills like enchanting still require personal relationships due to the lack of vellums.
---
Cast frost bolt until your target dies.  He should also do this.
---
Ferals are actually amazing for Twin Emps because unabalancing strike removes the defense advantage that warriors have over ferals. Warriors rely on their crit immunity while ferals just take them to the chest with their 16k armour. Same reason why they are amazing as soakers on Patchwerk. Massive armour, HP pool and dodge makes them very easy to heal when soaking hatefuls, especially for a guild that is progressing on Patch. 
---
As for MT though, no fucking way.
---
If you want to focus on imp damage for PVE you can do something like this.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZfxVzRxoxZxxbtM0z
---
Ruin in destro is basically mandatory. The spec gives some options. The 5 points in master demonology gives -20% threat with imp. This is a DPS increase depending on the tanks gear / skill. When not threat capped by the tank you can demonic sacrifice Succubus for 15% shadow damage boost. Fun spec for dungeons. I wouldn’t use it for raids unless threat is an issue.
---
That shit shouldn't even have to be told.  I guess I was just lucky the people I raided with.  There was almost 0 loot drama and the few drama whores we had got kicked to the curb.  But not every guild has that luxury I guess.
---
I LOVE YOU! thanks for that list :)
---
Medieval trope "orcs vs humans" but in spaaaaaaace... Nah that was stupid AF too.
---
It also lead to the epitome of "clown suits" as every piece of gear was neon colored with a random pallet and everything that wasn't in a set looked like clown vomit when mixed.
---
You can do keybindings and server-side settings in the final Stress Test, which has been delayed and may not actually happen.
---
You can do client-side settings and addons with https://arctium.io (how to copy WTF/addon settings between servers and characters is beyond the scope of this post)
---
For the server-side settings, because it doesn't look like we'll be getting a final Stress Test, I would spin up Arctium and test some macros for settings CVARs, keybindings you will have to do once we go Live or write an addon to set it for you.
---
lfm ony gbid 12/40 need everyone, come if bridge 4 inspect

I think it works in games like EVE because that universe is massive. The WoW world is so small it wouldn't server any purpose to split it up like that.
---
Stung by a Bee?
---
`BINDINGMODE 0`
---
This is for "per-character" bindings isn't it? Would need to be done for all characters.
---
He has said several times that he thinks Classic is a bad idea. It failing wouldn't make him look like a fool, but like he made an accurate prediction about the community. Brack didn't decide to start working on Classic, Morhaime was the company CEO when they announced it and Brack's hands are tied since if he cancels it the backlash would be huge, but if it fails it would mean he made an accurate prediction about the community. 
---
He doesn't care about how this makes him look to nerds on reddit, or the community. He cares about his career and advancing it, that means you need to look good to your bosses/shareholders, and if Classic is a huge success he looks like an idiot to them for saying it would fail when in reality it made them good money. If Classic fails it means they would have saved money by listening to Brack, which is the best look you can have in the world of business, making and saving money wherever possible.
---
I absolutely can't wait to fight both the Alliance and my own faction as a stalwart ENHANCEMENT SHAMAN, PARAGON OF THE HORDE!
---
Really makes me wonder if a modern phone could run this (provided you could attach normal pc Peripherals).
---
Requirements are crazy low :o
---
Thanks for testing this man!
---
Agreed that there's tiers.
---
There's typicaly (IME) 3 groups of effort / attendance.
---
- Core 20
---
- 10 usuallys / mostlys
---
- 10 filler
---
core &gt; usually &gt; filler --- with discretion, role, etc.
---
- 5% usually healer might win out over core 5% dps.
---
- 5% usually OT ties vs 5% core dps
---
Our (core tryhard) ret pally will get Choker of the Fire Lord over the mage that mostly shows up.
---
Thanks
---
I think you're being a bit conservative with the mana if you aren't frequently finding yourself under 20%.  Always having mana north of 50% is cool and all, but it means you're points are going into something you don't need instead of boosting your heals even further or increasing survivability.
---
I don't think you understand what that word means.
---
They wont advertise it till late September.  They already are struggling to guess launch numbers and they dont want to add a bunch more people to that.
---
Late September allows them to get a nice MAU boost for the end of Q3, and a nice MAU boost to the start of Q4.  
---
I suspect (and hope) there will be a free trial around then and more advertising.
---
He's the guy who said we don't want classic.  That's the end of the conversation around here.  He made a horrendous statement that showed a huge disconnect in what he thinks is reality and what is reality with his playerbase.
---
Now he's the president of Blizzard.  Failing up I guess.
---
Sry mate but your opinion is wrong.
---
and edgemaster's, etc. etc. etc.
---
obviously the marketing dept is protecting 8.2 from any inhouse competition
---
Mate I work in advertising. It costs as much as you want to spend. Do you really think the three posts Blizzard publishes on Facebook every single day cost $1,000,000 each? They could easily just use the same assets they've already created for the Blizzcon classic release and put it on social with or without a boost behind it. That being said, this whole post is a bit silly -- they have no need to panic about there being enough players like they would with a new release. It just doesn't warrant a big marketing budget. They still will advertise it though. Just not until it's a week away, and of course, after the game's been released. It'll be a lot easier to know what kind of spend to put into it when they've got some more reliable metrics.
---
Lol nah. Fruit roll up underwear with a pussy center, and a new sp Warcraft episode. I’ll be ok
---
Thanks for the opinion. I partly feels this way myself.
---
I just can't shake the looming feeling of viper sting and mana burn spam. In a mid-long fight.. it actually matters.
---
Hence my need for others thoughts.
---
If Classic fails the shareholders will hold him accountable because he predicted it would fail and took the gamble with their money, and if it succeeds they will give him a bonus for making them money and not care anything else.
---
TAZDINGOOOO
---
Deep wounds is trash with the crit you have going arms
---
The fact that Brack is president is better than him being involved with WoW directly.  Ion at least admits that Van/TBC was the best era of WoW.  Brack genuinely seems to think the modern minigame style of WoW is better.
---
We'll see how possible it is with 150% more parries from bosses.
---
Never encountered a /roll guild in any raiding guild I encountered during vanilla.
---
Also see my edit on stoneskin totem.  Its ok in pve when your tank is fighting a bunch of trash adds at once, but when the name of the game is big bursty hits that extra 6 absorbtion from the improved totem really isn't going to matter so much.
---
no guards there in vanilla
---
just annoying spiders
---
I actually play Retail WoW out in the country using LTE data! I raid Heroic as a Melee DPS perfectly fine with 200ms, it's only bad when it goes beyond 400. Downside to LTE is how unreliable it is about its speed. I recommend going into your network settings (assuming Windows 10) and under Data Usage set it so Windows can't use data in the background.
---
Someone recommended hunter, and that is the best choice for poor internet, but I say play what you want. Leeway fixes any melee issues you have, thanks to the game being made for 2004 internet :D
---
Not at 18 but you're pushing other skills further down the line like siphon life which at 30 or 33 can make a big difference when you're hitting the major pvp zones. But according to the guides you'd respec anyway and you'll be using a succubus, like I said theory crafting bs which is only useful if you're trying to break speedleveling records. 
---
If you really want to waste 50g down the line of respeccing costs just to get a 10% dps increase for 5 of the fastest levels, sure go ahead but that's really bad advice for the average player especially if they're new to a warlock and will probably play around with specs later on.
---
You probably didn't live long in Tanaris on your level 23 Hunter.
---
Honestly, the SMs are such great dungeons that I think doing em at least once is worth it just to re-experience it . The in game EXP and gear is just a bonus.
---
haha yeah, the temptation to spend money on the alt is real.
---
Not only that but the investment takes a while to pay off. If you're leveling an alt to 60 in order to make gold, you have to consider all the hours you could have been grinding gold on your main instead of leveling (to use the adult term, "opportunity cost")
---
Mordhau it’s a really good game, fuck it Imma play right now
---
When you cast shield a warrior, they don’t take damage for as long as the shield is up.
---
That might sound like a good thing — but just remember that warriors generate rage by taking damage. So, warriors rely on taking damage to tank well.
---
If you shield the warrior, they don’t take damage, so they aren’t able to generate rage, so they can’t do abilities to deal damage/threat.
---
Yeah that one piece of equipment is gonna absolutely hinder their survivability /s
---
It's absurd because WoW these days is all about chasing whatever gear the current tier drops. Blizzard even disables the passives on old gear just so that this sort of thing doesn't happen. Back in the day though, gear was far more interesting and while that was an extreme example of it, plenty of BiS gear wasn't from the most recent raid.
---
Raidlogging isn't even that bad when you have an alt you enjoy.
---
You think the extra parry haste is going to make Fury tanks impossible to heal? Are you aware that those same tanks would spam /sit to always be crit by the boss?
---
These specs are functionally the same...  The only difference is the points in improved lightning shield which isn't very good overall.  
---
Neither would be good for farming or solo content but you could probably heal anything.
---
Not for PvE tho. Trash adds don't exist in a BG environment. Having contant reduction in PvP is kinda huge.
---
Not interested i love the AH as it is.
---
Lol not at all dude.
---
Idk about WotLK, but I saw it used til T6 in BC, so it'll definitely last the entirety of classic vanilla.
---
I was looking at it and asking myself "where's the Paladin?!" But a little closer look shows you've found a fitting place :)
---
Earlier today my internet spiked while I was fighting Heroic Za'qul (a boss in the newest raid), thank goodness the leader was nice and let me solve my internet problem before the next pull! Windows automatically re enabled its ability to download updates in the background :(
---
It's not for PvE, as specified.
---
I have a few for various raid comps from constant naxx raiders (various pservers)
---
Are you a communist?
---
I was retarded, when I first watched the Classic WoW trailer I assumed they were going to base an expansion based on Classic WoW.
---
Warlock first
---
Brack didnt gamble, he wasn't in his current position when the project was started.
---
Hah! Good one!
---
If you're wearing a major armor piece with a 1/4 of the stam as the current raid tier 2 expansions later it will lmao. 
---
Though I suppose most vanilla keyboard turners wouldnt understand that
---
Dun mat
---
What is better in your opinion- The sight of sweaty black athletes or the thought of your friends and family starving in a communist regime?
---
No, it really doesn't. Have you been a Fury tank or healed a Fury tank? Because my guess is you have no idea what you're talking about and are just repeating your opinions of other people's opinions that also have no experience with Fury tanks.
---
I hope I can do that too then. I'm not a super social player, I often prefer pugs to friends parties :/
---
What about t2 specifically is strong? The pet bonus?
---
I still love you. Also what are the dots? NPCs I'm assuming?
---
Ok.  I don't remember if it was that way in Vanilla.  Can you find it?
---
*A* ***shit*** *ton.* Our dreams are perpetually haunted by belts and rails and little logistic bots.
---
thank you for finally giving me context for why i sometimes see this
---
Implying shamans don't drop situational totems.
---
Implying both won't be down at once in teamfights.
---
Both, for your entire group. Per hit..per player.. seems like a little but is a lot.. 
---
You switch to Tremor, Earthbind and Grounding a lot for smaller fights and or when a cc or movement class shows up. Also those two seconds on grounding legit can save lives.. eats a spell man. Also increases the value on totemic focus. 
---
A lot of being a good PvP healer is maxing your utility.
---
Quest objectives. Have so many quests I don’t even know where to start. Also my inventory is getting so packed with quest items that I have to delete low items constantly
---
I appreciate the subtlety of this troll
---
Not correct. T3 was still strong till 70.
---
GearScore is the *original* ilvl and a completely different system to the one Blizzard implemented. It was an add-on back in WotLK (and maybe before) that gave gear a score based on how "powerful" it was. Issue is, the implementation sucked and loads of BiS gear got a low score due to having less raw stats than other bits of gear. You also got people boosting their GS by doing stuff like wearing cloth armour as a paladin or wearing tank gear as DPS because it had a higher GS than their BiS gear. Despite that though, every pug used it to the point where if you didn't have GearScore installed, you weren't even being considered. It eventually forced Blizzard to implement ilvl which works infinitely better due to it directly correlating to stats.
---
If you mean endgame as raiding in general then no, if you mean it as in only Naxxramas then yes.
---
The PvP was pretty good. TBC arena was actually a lot of fun, and much much more balanced than a lot of people claim (people that dabbled in it and think they know what they're talking about).
---
Like yes, druids were very strong for a lot of the expansion, and rogues were OP in the last season, but as a whole the expansion was pretty balanced. You had different seasons where wildly different comps were able to succeed and take top spots in 2v2 and 3v3 (I don't think many people take 5s too seriously), and even in the same season you had some variation from battlegroup to battlegroup in which comp was top dog. 
---
It's actually funny, I've seen a few people claim that TBC was known for its PvE class balance but I'd say its PvE balance was weaker than its PvP. In PvE it was literally warlocks and hunters dominating the expansion for dps, with a few other contenders coming in every now and again (ele shaman T4, arcane mage T5 on some fights, melee being strong in T6). And 2 healers shitting on the others for the duration of the expansion. Tanks were in a much better spot than vanilla, but still not perfect.
---
Yes this is the exact reason why I am considering male. but the casting animation is goofy right?
---
Not part of the ones that made it happen... but very much looking forward to Classic! Thanks to all the unsung heroes for your commitment and persistence to seeing this through!
---
While I agree having no mobility sucks, I feel like it's a necessary evil to prevent the bloat that was seen in cata/mop, where every single class has every single utility... mobility, cc, self-heal, absorbs, intrerrupts... the lot.
---
They also can't sell store mounts and convenience on a cash shop in Classic WoW, so they have to justify creating it in the first place. The fact that we are getting it for only $15/month without any type of cash shop is amazing as it is.
---
I'm pretty OCD so I'd start my picking certain colours and clearing those one by one
---
I originally rolled a rogue because I fought through a bunker of rogues on my hunter, with tons of pet pulls and enemies running in fear. Finally got to the basement where a nice juicy chest was, pulled the mob guarding it...and watched as a rogue unstealthed, looted it, then snuck away. Make a rogue a few minutes later. I'd never pull a scoundrel move like that myself, but I understand it.
---
I'm very curious about this build for leveling since I heard that Imp Firebolt didn't work on classic or pservers, so machine-gun imp is an untested leveling spec.
---
Of my 300+ days played in vanilla, I never encountered a guild who used rolling as a form of loot distribution, guess the entire server were elitist twats
---
it's all about speed.. the addon makes it quick and easy.
---
&gt; more relatable and humerous
---
https://i.imgur.com/t3JQKgq.jpg
---
I would pay 30
---
So, I don't know the context of the image. To me it looked like the hunter was asking for all the weapons.
---
Funny enough I'd argue classic wow is gonna drive more traffic then WC3 but they can't sell it as a $60 game so they don't care
---
terrible call
---
You aren't though. Rogues and warriors are just dps, they provide nothing else. You can provide food/water, portals, decurse and the best cc in the game.   
---
Honestly I'm surprised mage isn't even more popular than it is, even if it's the most played class at 60, I'd expect more people to go for it. It's just that good.
---
Ya people always forget the other side of this, some guy who just wants to get on, and do his raids for the week. That's his version of fun. And he doesnt want it to take 12 hours and tons of wipes. So they use gearscore.
---
You might want to start this after the server list is announced so you can make sure the people can even get their gold.
---
Oh fuck I forgot this was reddit, can’t talk about having sex without an army of incels thinking you’re a chad.
---
My bad I totally meant my anime body pillow with a flesh light I haven’t cleaned or sanitized in months that I fuck 4 times a day. Forgive me, my virginity is still intact and I’m totally not an average dude that has average sex on an average basis.
---
Didn’t mean to flex on you guys.
---
&gt;Windfury lets warriors push ahead of druids as tanks
---
Except the warrior tank likely won’t be in a group with a Windfury shaman. 
---
Also Windfury definitely benefits the dps classes more than the tanks, so threat gen will be even more useful. If anything, druids have an even stronger case on horde than on Alliance, where threat is much more easily controlled with Salv.
---
Yeah I had 4 60s in vanilla, really only played my rogue. That being said, just leveling characters was probably my favorite thing to do! I'll definitely end up leveling every class to 60... Well maybe not Paladin because I'm maining horde, and I find paladin leveling to be a real grind. Got a paladin to 59 in vanilla and I could never even push myself to do that last level lol.
---
what a strange thing to be upset about.
---
I think the majority of classic players will be casual and wont give much of a fuck.
---
My pally war team absolutely loved Druid war teams. It was the most challenging fight and we could win more than half the games, assuming equal gear. Judgement of Justice says hi to your travel form.
---
The olympics? Really? Im pretty sure even the champions league final has more viewers than any single olympics event
---
Fair enough. I played mostly shaman prior to mage. Being able to switch between melee sos, ele dps and heals made for variable gameplay.
---
Its all over the launcher for the current players and all the ones who want classic knew it was coming... why spend money on marketing when twitch does it for them for free and the players are already waiting...
---
All my 20 lvl 13 alts laugh in pain reading this.
---
The LH project is shutting down while some of the staff will merge with another project to make a TBC server.
---
Have an alt and just grind out your rested xp.
---
Ya there is you just cant get over people being better than you.
---
How many bags would you get?
---
In this version he is telling them he needs the weapons more than them and that he has to take them
---
Heroic dungeons isn't a bad idea dude, that was freaking great. All dungeons from lvl 60-70 was content you actually did at max lvl. 
---
Flying was a bit meh, but for world PvP. Isle of Quel'Danas was an amazing zone. No flying, always loads of people.
---
Darkshore i loved that zone before cata  and i alsoq look forward to questing out of southshore again.
---
That I did. Would you like to point me to the part of NostalgiaSchmaltz's comment that I missed where they were being fawningly deferential?
---
Remember all those Fortnite &amp; Apex ads leading up to launch?
---
Oh, I make a minestrone like soup.  It’s pretty cheap to make, hearty and fills you up
---
White beans, spinach, carrots, green beans, peas, lentils, chicken broth and like 1/3 a box of pasta
---
I make it on my date off and have it all week. I’m pretty frugal about things
---
If you had T2+ gear you almost used it until max lvl and T3 gear was better than most blues at 70. You only lost some HP but gained dmg, which was good enough for DPS if you could stay out of aggro.
---
There's almost no marketing done by Blizzard for Classic...
---
I expect we will hear something between aug 1st - 10th
---
the hunter is broken, like the tribe
---
Just wait... Someone will create a classic gear tier list, associate scores with that gear, and spew out an arbitrary number as an average.
---
😒
---
The addon you want is Quest Completist. One of the maintainers has said they might be supporting Classic, but otherwise we don't know.
---
Barrens4life
---
Is that the case on beta?
---
I have done the math have you? Honest question, have you actually done the math?
---
But there's no better feeling than having all those Un goro quests completeted in your log
---
Raided Ret all the way up to C’Thun. Tier 2.5 with Sulfuron (didn’t get the eye until BC era) - I could usually keep up with the bottom tier of our geared rogues and fury warriors in dps, and paladin utility is never to be underestimated. 
---
*I was 100% on-the-ball with greater blessings, pretty sure that’s the only reason I got brought along*
---
I miss old Darkshore dearly.
---
It's really not. 
---
First of all, deep wounds ignores armor. So it's not 20% damage per point. It's not clear what the armor values of mobs will be (to me, at least), as private servers get this wrong, but I strongly suspect armor on mobs is about 20% damage reduction. It's about what my autoattacks seem to be like, and if you just look at for example, some random level 23-24 humanoids (shadowhide assassin, thistlefur pathfinder, bluegill murloc, bloodfury assassins... .only the murloc is below 20% damage reduction (at 18%). Everyone else is above that. 
---
so first of all, divide by 0.8, to get 25% of your weapon damage applied per crit.
---
Then, consider that hamstring can crit. And you pretty much always apply hamstring ([and hamstring kiting has been demonstrated to work in the beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsx2ARJyXY)). So at the outset of every combat, you get an extra, free, deep wounds roll. 
---
Then consider that arm's primary mode of attack is cleave and sweeeping strikes, both of which are multitarget attacks. And which combine with each other (every time you cleave with sweeping strikes active, they proc off each other, giving you 4 autaottacks). 
---
Next, consider that arms... gets axe specialization by 36. So while you starting crit chance is probably about 5%, you will be up to 10% by 36. 
---
At the level you get it, sure. it's only about 0.125% increased attack damage, which means it's only 25% more total damage over cruelty (but of course, cruelty also gives you increased rage generation and cannot be clipped like a 12 second dot can). that's not amazing.
---
But from there, you proceed to start hamstringing every single mob and cleaving every double pull, and getting 5 free autoattacks from sweeping strikes every ~45 seconds or so (assuming you are not in group content and actually have to line up your pulls and manage your health. 
---
Beyond that, it's pretty easy not to clip deep wounds, as you can often just let them run and either bandage, or finish off the mob that isn't running. 
---
And then you double your crit chance with axe spec? 
---
It very quickly goes from only 25% more damage than a point in cruelty if you don't clip it, to "significantly more damage than cruelty no matter what you do". 
---
But yeah, if you treat arms as a single target spec, which it is ABSOLUTELY NOT, it can seem like it's not that amazing. As a damage amp to heroic strike, it's probably just flat out worse than cruelty, as you can very much clip the 12 second dot. But in the way you actually play arms, with hamstring and cleave and sweeping strikes? that's a lot of not particularly good attacks that all can proc deep wounds, and if you are fighting 2 mobs, it is fine just to let one run away while you kill the other one. 
---
Oh yeah, and of course, overpower. Which I don't like to factor in, as there is strong antisynergy between charge and overpower (charge is a stun and stunned mobs cannot dodge).
---
Thousand Needles
---
Or resurrect more than one person every 30 mins
---
Thousand needles. It probably got the most drastic makeover and I really really loved it pre cata.
---
I set foot in the post cata zone for like 30 minutes and dipped out. I hated it.
---
Without being torn in half... that was always such a puzzling decision to me.
---
Osrs, hearthstone, and just started trying out retail for 8.2.
---
Ele heals cost the same as Resto heals. Resto does heal for 10% more, that is true but if you want to be part of a successful premade I think you should consider rolling a Priest if pure healing is your ultimate goal. 
---
Horde premades rely on burst and Resto just doesn't do that very well when lightning spells take a full second longer to cast and crit for less. If you're set on Resto healing in pvp, absolutely go for it but there's a reason you don't see very many people doing it in premades.
---
Free makes a big difference. People love free shit.
---
Especially for the air totem quests.
---
Why would they flood it... it made no sense!!!
---
I don't understand what is stressful in that "screenshot"
---
if you have tier 2 you can heal ok in aq40 as shadow spec as long as you have your mana consumables. i was secretly too cheap to respec back a couple times after grinding pvp... pretty sure we got our guild first twin emps kill while i was healing in my pvp spec.
---
Not ann arbor but Michigander all the same!
---
&gt; Next, consider that arms... gets axe specialization by 36. So while you starting crit chance is probably about 5%, you will be up to 10% by 36.
---
You get weapon specializations while leveling? Ok, I concede the whole argument, I don't feel like discussing stuff with the clueless.
---
With a 1.0 feral main tank. We have to make it so that only sadists will even think of playing.

I remember there being only like 7 quests in un'goro

How about the implication that you have to have developed a game to comment on classic wow? Also the first part of his comment about layering is just clear mischaracterisation of my argument. He also misquotes my comment twice. And he doesnt recognise or respond to half of my points. These are the reason he looks like a blizzard drone.
---
&gt;The other issue of Battle Rez, oh my goodness. It’s not even like groups don’t want me. I actually don’t want to be in the group without a Shaman or Priest since anyone who dies has to run back. It really sucks always needing a rezzer with you, especially if you’re healing there aren’t many Shaman / Priest DPS
---
Look, you are not playing as a happy tree-hugging hippie priest. Natural selection know no partial success and your only job is to make Darwin proud.
---
The exact quote:
---
We  agree with the many WoW Classic enthusiasts in Australia, New Zealand,  and Southeast Asia that it will be a very good thing for players in that  part of the world to connect to realms that are hosted in that part of  the world.
---
Planned it all along!
---
We will have Oceanic realms for WoW Classic, with game servers hosted in Australia, at launch [on August 27 266](https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/22990080/), and we’ll let you know the names of the Oceanic realms before name reservations start on August 13.
---
Thanks!
---
Like you i enjoy the leveling experience more then anything so my answer is all of them. Ok now that was not helpful  but what i would do is prioritize getting a class that you will be willing to farm with first so you can farm money and gear for the characters that follow.
---
The guy is making fun of his quote "you think you do, but you don't" in regards to wanting classic. He knows he the guy is
---
are you sure you don't wanna play on a TBC server? cause you'd look better in a [clown suit](https://i.imgur.com/VwphUZO.jpg)

So you want it to be like runescape before the GE?
---
Just as good :) all Michiganders welcome.

He made it sound like people life tap between pulls in raids. Same stuff in dungeons as in raids though, life tap in combat, drink out of combat.

Keep in mind, it's ONLY procs of the weapon you are using. SoR does not proc anything else.

---
Yeah, so that's factually incorrect.
---
Durotan is now a black lesbian and dont you dare question it you bigot
---
I agree!
---
Also, the launch week will have more than enough players already. Maybe they will advertise it after the initial hype passes?
---
Are you MT? Really shouldn't need FR gear as Bear. If you pack correctly 16 slots should be enough for all of that, although you are right in that you won't have a lot of spots leftover.
---
That's not as bad as gear/achievement score requirements
---
Did he have berserker at the time I didnt look that's like 30% damage
---
Is it even possible to talk about DW tanking without being condescending? Haven’t seen it done yet.
---
Well that just doesn't make sense, if you are some fresh 60 mage in most of your BiS in a pvp spec, and a guild has been practicing a boss for a week, and you join an open slot and kill the boss with them, you didn't work for 1 week like the rest of them, you necessarily contributed less, you basically afk'd through most of the week long encounter and just showed up at the end. The reason guilds do this is because you usually have a core of players who are more dedicated, and if they get a larger portion of the loot they can continue to progress and carry the people who frankly don't care as much, and get less loot because of it. It's a fine system for both parties, raiding is going to be easy but you get paid based on your value to the other people or else it all devolves into doing the least work for equal pay.
---
I want to join a guild where I can farm more and get more loot than people who don't contribute as much, it's a good way to gear out the top players for future merges or keeping the guild alive when the flakes leave to join their friends. Best of all it's a voluntary system, don't join if you don't like it.
---
Speculation is that the 3 free days of playtime will interfere with people resubbing just for stress test. So they're going to wait for it to expire. Just a guess of folks lately.
---
I’m familiar with your post, I did a lot of research about this before I made a post myself (google led me to reddit several times)!  I really like this!  It seems like a spec that it seems to give you options— a slightly hampered DS/Ruin build with strong burst on the pull with the imp, and since you have the improved imp, you can be the Blood Pact Warlock too if your group needs it!
---
As for PvP, I just think it’d be fun for some Battleground/Open World shenanigans, and the bursting imp to me is hilarious!  Plus you have Rain of Fire for those big AV groups!
---
I could totally be wrong, so correct me if that’s the case, but this seems like a build that isn’t so far out there.  If someone inspected my talents or something to make sure I wasn’t doing something idiotic, my guess is it would pass muster.
---
SQUAAAAAD
---
This is wrong. At min 6% per warrior. If your raid is short on shamans its a minimum of ~16% per warrior or 6% increased threat from tanks (so for the entire raid a 6% higher threat cap). At the minimum. Before tanks get TF, and after warriors start scaling maxing out their threat (occurs at different times during Vanilla) twisting can provide up to 32% damage per warrior in group (not claiming this is an average but the max). In the worst case twisting is about 24% of a warrior's dps up to 120% of a warriors dps. The likelihood that it ever hits 120% is low but 80-100% will occur.  The issue is resto already provides like ~40% (group depending 20-60% of a pure dps) plus is a full healer so is worth. As Resto shamans 100% a full healer you can see them as worth about ~140% of a pure healer or dps. This why if you go google/yt pserver horde kills/server 1st kill you will find 7 [SEVEN] shamans in those raids; i found one with 6. However, even while twisting resto shamans can do some very down ranked healing. 
---
Shamans are not replaceable with any pure dps or healer, if you are considering what they provide to raids. Maybe the healer wants to dps, in this case they are still better off twisting and very down rank healing. Let a moonglow druid or priest dps... they will do a much better job anyway.
---
Yeah but you lose pally buffs which are huge and get nothing as a result.

---
Ok buddy, whatever you say.
---
I wonder who comes up with that. You can't really put a number on it, because SoC and SoR scale differently. 
---
SoR damage is mostly static and only improves when you get a higher rank (you likely won't have spelldmg gear while levelling), while SoC scales with growing weapon dmg and attack power.
---
SoC scales much better with crit, as it can crit, while SoR can't and JoC crits deal double dmg and are based on melee crit, while JoR crits are based on spell crit and only deal +50% dmg. Not to mention JoC also deals double dmg when you stun the mob.
---
It's a complete oversimplification to just say 3.4 weapon = SoR and slower = SoC. Also 3.4 seems very slow already for me. I would expect this to only hold true, when you got a fresh rank of SoR and are low level. You'll need a much faster weapon for SoR once your crti chance gets reasonable and/or you are 1-2 levels away from a new SoR rank.
---
It’s raining in my eyes too bro

I could honestly see a Group Finder (not dungeon finder) addon being made. I was surprised there wasn't one built into the game in vanilla considering DAoC a much smaller and niche MMO had one.

Please follow along the discussion. You only push Amplify Curse back and that's negligible. You respec once you get succubus and go full affliction. This is just about the time you can get 5/5 Fel Concentration and start drain tanking, though wand will be better till 30ish. 13-24 is about 15-20 hours, so shaving a half hour off mob grinding is DEFINITELY worth the 10 silver to respec.
---
If you are worried about 50g "down the line" then you're not going to take the game seriously enough to warrant having this discussion. 50g is the price of a 2 hour consumable. Getting to 60 half an hour faster means I get an extra half an hour of Mara farm in. Or that lotus spawn. The noob might not ever respec from SM/Ruin. No way are they changing specs enough without raiding to worry about this.
---
For a new player, this is the mathematically sound spec plan, and until you prove the entire warlock discord wrong I'd ask you to stop leading noobs astray.
---
Oh and for the tryhards, you can get Demonic Sacrifice buff and respec back to SM/Ruin. 50g for a 30min 15% damage buff. 
---
Either way, noob or hardcore, you should go Imp Imp.
---
I fully support totem twisting i am saying the imp WF totem talent is trash for these reasons:
---
1. It adds 27 dps (im sticking with 27) That is trash.
---
2. You no longer can mana tide for yourself if resto (meaning you are far less effective at twisting plus other things). 
---
3. You lose more than 27 dps from your own talents as an enh shaman. 
---
4. As for ele it makes it non viable entirely. 
---
I don't think twisting is bad. I think warriors and rogues expecting a RESTO Shaman to twist is a bad. Maybe at naxx or if you have way too many healer before tanks get TF.
---
Some thing a lot of non HORDE player forget is their is no BoSalvation, its TRanquil air totem and yes before often before Thunderfury and in Naxx warriors and other classes will have threat issues. Twisting  totems then can add another 10% dps for each warrior. 
---
Even the Alliance tanks are tanking 1/2 naked (not really) without shields and pumping the dps specs to generate threat because it IS an issue. For hordes' melee, with their WF totem its ~25%+ more of an issue than it is for alliance. The issue is you don't always need traq totems, so its not a flat damage increase.
---
Why is it difficult to get a reck bomb off, becuase sit-critting is more difficult? It all depends on the class. A reck bomb vs a fire mage? Yeah, good luck. But vs a rogue, you likely have full reck bomb ready by the time you are out of the stun lock.
---
As holy reck is a strong supportive spec, you are likely a primary target and can easily build reck stacks and sustain through the damage. 
---
Ret reck has trouble building a full reck bomb as they are not a primary target, must attack to be a threat and can't sustain thorugh damage by themselves that well. But then again a full bomb from a ret reck is a nearly guaranteed oneshot.

---
dang you're right
---
are 2h weapons doomed to only be for pvp then?
---
Did you get a beta invite? That shit should warrant it 100%
---
This is why I only play Sub rogue. We have so many problems in every spec if we are trying to even remotely fight fair that it’s basically just poach kills on people below 70% or die to various dots.
---
1.Not really, 99% of ppl you encounter outside of bg and duels are dead to standart rogue opening
---
2.same as 1
---
3.FF is frustrating in bg but thats it, thorns do like 20 damage, you can still vanish out of roots
---
Arms is in fact superior to Fury for leveling phase 1-40. Overpower 50% is very valuable and weapon specialization during leveling is completely fine. People go for axe, which provides +5crit. During leveling, Its actually easy to keep 2h axes only since level 29, starting with Corpsemaker in RFK, progressing with Whirlwind axe, Bonebiter (ally only), Executioner Axe, Lords Alexander Axe, which is for 51-52lvl. At level 60, you generally respec for your needs. And at last, arms provides PvP utility. As fury, you are a simple target dummy to anyone. Arms at least gives you any chance to fight back, mostly due to Tactical Mastery talent. Many long time warrior players prefer arms over fury.
---
I am not subbed and I will be subbed like day before launch :D
---
Yeah, I had friends who got really burned out in Vanilla because of the amount of time it took to gear the whole raid, and once their characters had a decent amount of gear they felt obliged to keep going as the group had invested in them.
---
Nope and i have 3 active accounts.
---
That does not directly translate to Blizzard making more money, it's just different people paying.
---
Blizzard is not printing gold they facilitating the gold to money trade between two players, minimizing the need for player to buy gold on the black market.
---
In TBC and WotLK gold selling and account hacking was a real problem, the token might not be the perfect solution but it's the lesser of two evils.
---
Undercity (if that's considered a zone). Everyone I've ever met ever says it's awful and they avoid it at all costs. I absolutely love it.
---
I originally looked into it because of the severe handicap warlocks have on horde side.
---
In my opinion as a horde you either do this. Hope your shaman has 100% threat reduction uptime (he wont) or sit around afk during a fight untill KTM isn't going loco anymore (in wich case you lose dps). 
---
This spec still has everything DS/Ruin offers, with only the downside of no improved corruption (not allowed to use it anyway) and no improved life tap (this is actually somewhat of a big deal sadly). But nothing you can't work around. 
---
If you do this as a orc lock with black book + AQ20 set (bind swap weapon macro with your fel domination) i'm confident you will outdps the traditional warlocks.
---
Hunters are needed for Tranqshot. 2-3 Hunters are needed in Naxx. You will be fine and you will do lots of pulling especially in Naxx. In BWL you will have to kite.
---
Hunter is perfectly fine in endgame and not boring at all. You shouldn't expect to be near the top DDs as soon as P4 hits though
---
Someone doesn't get that pserv is not Vanilla, and certainly is NOT Classic, which will not be 100% exactly like Vanilla.
---
You don't know what tanking will be like. No one does. So stop telling people what's what.
---
Damn that’s a lot of money over 15 years!
---
Do you still play retail a lot?
---
I don't run BfA on my SSD, haha. It's way too big.
---
Not earlier to reserve your names?
---
That just has to be Blizzards biggest Moneymaker! People forgettig to subscribe :D
---
I mean the monthly subscribtion doesn't hurt - it is not too much to make an effort for it :D
---
You may be right, but only because there are no Death Knights. All other classes pale in comparison!
---
I also wanna mention Baron / cstrike gaming.
---
His content is mainly streaming and uploading unedited raids without much commentary/viewer interaction. But it's chill videos and you can watch alot of the boss fights.
---
That’s fucked. I was hearing they favored long time subs too
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;interesting/fun/many other better adjectives  
---
&gt; itemization!
---
it's so interesting/fun/somuchbetter that it fucks over several class/specs
---
Many experienced players do, though its usually to swap to a pvp spec. Additionally, people are much more efficient at farming gold than you are. To some people, 100g/week isn't too bad considering the amount of time they play and their in-game income.
---
He's just another pserver tryhard who seems to think classic is insanely difficult, which absolutely requires total min/max to even move an inch into a raid.
---
Jokes on you...
---
I’m playin a Druid.
---
Barrens chat ftw
---
Pretty simple really...the people who are inerested in playing already know about it...why is Marketing required?
---
Who is going to do that. You know shamans have the worst mana efficiency of all healers and by a mile right? 
---
Every sim i have seen puts it just under 27dps total. 
---
It can be possible, more so if you can find timers for totem ticks. As totem don't apply buffs consistently but in pulses.
---
Absolutely not, I'm still going to aim at 2-H fury up untill late AQ at least. Since 2h requires less hit% it's easier to itemize early on.
---
And *you're* talking about private servers, not Classic,  which you have never fucking raided in. So YOU don't know wtf you're talking about.
---
Of course individually, but one after the other it's quite a time commitment
---
Blizzard has already confirmed character creation before launch.
---
Oh boy, you are clearly the clueless one in this argument :O
---
Stam on one piece of gear isn't going to make or break your survivability in a raid especially when that raid is Wrath naxx. Sounds like you just need to get better at mechanics.
---
The amount of players that do this is in the single digit percentile. Barely nobody respecs twice a week, regardless of how much gold you make. And it wouldn't be just 100g/week it would be several hundred, considering consumables like flasks if you use them, etc.
---
Most stats are similar to t1, but the damage is significantly higher on t2
---
I can technically play BfA on my laptop with an Intel 620 gpu. I get 30-50 fps in the world, probably dropping a lot lower in raids, haven't tried. 
---
But at least for me in WoW 30 fps is totally unplayable, because frame rate is for some reason directly tied to input lag or something. Like my cursor is lagging when my frames drop that low, it's awful. If it was just the graphics it would be fine, but now it's input too. 
---
Did you run into similar issues with classic? Or is it maybe just a problem on my end that I can fix?
---
Nobody will roll on TF. It will be given to the MT and after that to reliable players. Mostly tanks, sometimes Rogues. It is not good for a fury warrior as there is no way to reduce threat.
---
In 5 mans you are fine to roll on 2h as long as you tell it everybody before the run. Normally everybody will agree. If not you can leave or the person not agreeing can leave.
---
Consider subscribing a bit earlier to reserve your name.
---
Still waiting, gonna subscribe for the character creation. Last time I was subbed was in 07.
---
&gt;but surely it could be some algorithm based on the actual stats rather than manual assignment?
---
You'd have to account for stuff like  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm)  being BiS for cats even accounting for Naxx gear.
---
If you followed this you'd be so goddamn jacked. What's missing is chin ups times 5 everytime you die.
---
Not only blizzards. Forgetting to unsubscribe from anything is probably one of the things people lose most of their money.
---
Never heard of that, ever.
---
Your farming problems are...yours alone. 100g a week for a competent player, especially well geared, is nothing.
---
Wait, they flooded Thousand Needles? It's been over 10 years but I still remember that zone. The monsters!
---
Oh, character creation starting earlier? Damn I didnt know that. Thanks.
---
let's take it a few steps further.... no items at all!
---
The fact that it's Un'Goro Crater and it says it's Silithus? I know I kind of had a moment when I read that.
---
I think they favored only streamers. Lol.... Fuck theirs 14years paying customers right? :)
---
People don't like facts, expect a lot of downvotes.
---

Way better than launch that's for sure. I get 100+ FPS but I have a solid computer.
---
“You won’t give us free advertising and subs because we said the only way you can get the invite is being subbed? You’re kidding!”
---
Not surprised by it tho lol
---
On horde they are perfectly fine. BRE is not the only 2h Weapon. People also don't understand that it will take several month until every Rogue and warrior does get two raidlevel 1h swords or axe. Some warriors will ahve to go 2h atleast for some month as BRE will be better than blue dual 1h no matter the proc is usefull or not
---
$15/mo is practically free for anyone with a job.
---
Original Durotar and some quests in the Barrens. Have not played through that since actual vanilla.
---
I will sub on 26th. Money grubbing scheme to reserve your name is frankly pathetic, but they are bleeding money and you people fall for that shit for some reason.
---
&gt;I’d say that was twin emps personally.
---
according to the Twin Emperors all our warlocks were carried.
---
Im actually happy about that,for completely egoistic reasons. I like when there are fewer icons and less cluttered and I know how to navigate the app anyways. 
---
I understand the problem though, hopefully they point an arrow with some graphics saying "click here to try classic" or something
---
I dont recall that being the case. I'm pretty sure the loot-tables changed close to TBC.
---
Tbh unless you need something from BWL / MC I'd just go there with an alt
---
Because its a stupid system for an organized guild with re-occuring players.
---
In order to keep your good players engaged they need to be rewarded. This also serves to make the slackers up their game.
---
I did not have 3 accounts the whole 15 years one is like 8 years old and the other was my guild bank back in vanilla and just reactivated around 3 months ago.
---
With /roll you risk members of your Guild who put serious weight into the raids and constantly showing up leaving because of bad luck. Imagine a new member with gets into the raid and then takes the item you wanted for weeks... it's a guaranteed /gquit.
---
Agreed, but it's the principle more than anything I think. People will line up for a free toaster when they don't even fucking eat bread. And sadly you lose a lot of people when a credit card is needed.
---
I'm still not familiar with the post sundering Azeroth because sitting in Org/SW and spamming dungeons was the fastest way to level.
---
It is viable if you know your shit. You have to know when to switch to shield and when to dw. You have to know about consumables, dmg spikes, your healers etc. 
---
For 95% of all tanks it will not be viable. And for tanks in casual guilds it simply won't be needed as the DDs are slacking. No need to DW as long as you generate enough threat to be ontop of your DDs
---
Swap weapon macro, would you switch your weapon to something else?  
---
So would a typical pull be something like -&gt;
---
Have Imp out
---
Begin pull and pop Black Book, Imp spams Firebolt til he ooms
---
when Imp ooms, cast Fel Domination and summon Succubus,
---
Sacrifice Succubus, begin spamming Shadowbolt for rest of the fight and tapping as necessary.
---
How big of a hindrance is lacking Improved Life Tap?  Also, what are your thoughts on [Pimgib’s Collar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18354/pimgibs-collar#dropped-by)?
---
resilience gear
---
too much outer space stufe
---
horde and alliance losing identity.
---
That is the way it seems i know alot of long time subscribers that never got a invite even though they have participated in past betas.
---
There is nothing elitist about giving more gear/rewards to the higher performing players. Those players probably spend alot more time outside of raids farming consumables, getting worldbuffs, getting all their pre-raid gear etc.
---
Slacking should not be rewarded.
---
In vanilla I onky had one character. Wasn't until mod TBC that I had a max alt.
---
Let's just say it's not what the pvp crowd wanted. Most hated pvp change ever i think
---
 You fine folks are doing Odin's work, keep it up!
---
Same here. Which means fuckall, when we already know Classic will be different. So we don't know what will work at all, what will work *best*, which will be common tactics, etc. So quit pretending you know.
---
Yep. I ran into the same problem. WoW client cant handle 144hz for some reason but creates these wierd purple spots all over the place, sort-of like graphic artefacts. If I put a custom resolution of 120hz it works great, no spots.
---
The pre burnout anticipation is strong with that attitude
---
To humor you, I actually like the idea - just not for Classic WoW. The whole point of this project is to allow players to relive the experience of Vanilla WoW - not create a new game or a different version of it (even if we need to accept realities like layering, 1.12 itemization, etc).
---
Again, I like the idea and where your head is at, but we need to keep Classic nochanges for this to really work best for all of us.
---
Brings back some good but pained memories. Trying to secure a Tank and Healer yelling in trade. Spend 30 mins getting to the Dungeon and then one of them says "Sry gtg."
---
BACK TO TOWN!
---
Don't do it jimmy!
---
But hunters? 
---
100% agreed on the frist 4. But after you equiped your OT, a good rogue, who does it´s job can have a shot too in my opinion.
---
At a 4% Dropchance most likely this won't be the case before KT is down though :D
---
Lmao dude mentioned using it on a class that wasn't even used as a dps by serious guilds "half way thru wrath"
---
Worth noting none of the pf addons are getting ported to Classic.
---
Every time I've played WoW regularly, the alliance equivalent to Orgrimmar has been Stormwind in terms of player activity, and I've played Alliance almost exclusively throughout.
---
Despite hunters being the way they are, when i read, "I am new what do i do?" I say hunter about every time. 
---
One their dps in MC and BWL is not bad (i think is higher than Locks at least until full geared BWL) And two its just so easy to level (but still much harder because mend pet is not TBC yet).
---
&gt; we drink outside of it, or is that just me..?
---
Or life-tap and eat... fish are free.
---
Or, I would eat, if the priest wouldn't interrupt his drinking, jump up and flash heal me to full. Guess some habits are strong. :-)
---
I’ve had a few roll offs using loot council, but it’s really not a good primary loot system especially in vanilla
---
You have mistaken World War with communism
---
Remember to make sure that your source-cable can handle the resolution combined with the high frequenzy (hz). Lower versions of HDMI cant handle the bandwidth requirements of 1440p + 144hz.
---
(also, The wow client cant handle 144hz period. It creates wierd artefacts. 120hz is fine though if you make a custom resolution)
---
Go arms to 60
---
It's reset for the week now. 4 more resets til classic.
---
It happened in Cataclysm
---
Subbing the day before character creation for name reservation
---
This would be tight. As you're riding past the lake in Redridge you see in zone chat an old gnome selling baked salmon. He's there on Tuesdays and Thursdays before he goes off to WPvP. Little things like this would turn up all over I'd love it. AH should be more expensive and be reserved for those rare recipe drops and shit.
---
It's pretty weak in pvp, you're asking for advice and then arguing with everyone.  I dont care how many hits are happening it doesn't change the fact that you're spending 2 talent points to gain an infinitesimal damage mitigation on a totem that is already meh in pvp.  Pvp fights aren't about sustained dps anyway they re about quick burst damage and reactions.
---
I tanked with sword+shield in vanilla. I have tanked with all imaginable styles on private servers. It is a commonly held theory that damage output by bosses on most current private servers is higher than vanilla. Ergo: dw-tanking in vanilla will be a thing, assuming previously mentioned conditions are met.
---
Haha yea, I've encountered way too many times, move and inch as a tank, pull a non elite, priest gets up at 20% mana and heals.
---
Gaming and gamers as a whole are in a very different spotlight today. I don't think you'll see that many tv shows trying to claim that ppl are hooked on some heroin like drug, instantly losing their lives the moment they've started playing the game.  
---
Now ppl don't care if you do drugs, as long as you dont damage anyone else ;)   
---
So no, i don't think there will be south park episode about this again, but let's hope i'm wrong.
---
Damn I must have missed this!
---
Is the date announced yet?
---
&gt; definitely no
---
And that only because you disagree on remorseless attack. Wtf?
---
It's hard to proof people wrong when you got unfathomable stuff like running an extra couple of yards away from the mob because your corruption is instant leading to less hits taken leading to less downtime. That's something you can't calculate. 
---
Or being able to take on a higher level/groups with kiting. Is it the most optimal way to gain xp? No ofcourse not but it's nice to get a core mechanic asap so you don't create bad habits.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying they're wrong in their calculations I just think for your average new lock this isn't the best advice.
---
Another example is CoEx, this is always listed as optional and situational but it's one of the best damn spells for pvp and great for kiting purposes in pve as well, that's without amping it up which destroys people who have no cd's. 
---
How do you measure in not corpse running in your leveling build when you crushed a rogues sprint with amped CoEx?
---
Guides are all good and well but you shouldn't blindly follow them or you might end up thinking Maraudon is the best way to make money in an instance. It's a lot of rehashed content, I doubt you'll find many videos on lbrs/dm n-w/zg farming on that discord which are on par to double what you can earn in Maraudon. Hint: you need CoEx in 3 of them.
---
Pretty much, as much as I’d like one for my rogue for swag it’s just not a sensible decision to give one to us. By the time a rogue should get one they wouldn’t want it as an upgrade
---
Trigz is decent, he at least played top level arena, even if that was a long time ago. Perplexity on the other hand, just like monkeynews is completely overrated.
---
this seems pretty useful ngl, thank you.
---
Some things need not see the light of day.
---
In AQ40 you'll need 8 warriors tanking on trash. In Naxx you'll **NEED** 8 warriors tanking on 4hm. It is in the guilds interest to put TF on as many warriors as possible, assuming they are good performers and regular attendees. Giving TF to a rogue should be a very rare exception.
---
Slay the Spire and DOTA Underlords
---
Yeah a random arrow totally isn’t more clutter than an icon in a list designed for icons
---
Do you know the date of this yet?
---
Did you have consumables all in? If you watch old videos (Ragnaros firstkill etc.), those guys haven't had more then 1-2 consumables in. Did you use stoneshield pots on CD 14 years ago? DW tanking is some serious shit. It is working, but a lot of effort is needed. A lot of (dw specific!) equip (T2,5 is nice, PVP gear is nice) is needed. A lot of know how is needed. In most cases DW tanking is NOT needed to hold aggro. 
---
So as I said, it is working under special circumstances. But for 95% of all tank it won't work.
---
I would say because your tank need gear more than your fury warrior (or ret pala for that matter).
---
In TBC loot councils were great, Everyone who wants link x slot. Everyone links then it typically went to no tards who it was the highest upgrade for (or someone who had not gotten anything in a while).
---
Works in eve online every station has it's own "auction house", there are no vendors in the game that buys loot items. Players who focus on trade buy all the "vendor trash" and reprocess or transport it to tradehubs and resell it.
---
I don't think it would ever work in wow don't it adds a lot of game play to sandbox games like eve, where you have traders moving cargo between tradehubs and pirates suicide ganking them to try and steal the cargo.
---
So why does every footage show that each player will trigger it?
---
I will do the same alongside with a fresh account. I'm shaddy.
---
Most of the casual guilds on my server back in the day used DKP. The ones who didn't used LC. I have never actually heard of a guild back then who rolled for items
---
August 13th
---
Are you a bird?
---
BC one love
---
I won't subscribe until August
---
I'll subscribe a day prior to the name reservations.
---
LOL. Thinking that private servers are even close to the real thing. That's cute.
---
I've played hello kitty island adventure with my daughter, can I use that in my tanking CV as well?
---
I want a discussion. Not advice.
---
Just because I disagree with something you say, doesn't mean it is an argument. Sorry you see it that way.
---
Thanks for your opinion. I may see it differently in the future. Currently I don't.
---
A teamfight doesn't play out like that most the time in a public environment. With coordination sure. Which I did imply I would likely change specs in that scenario... I don't see why you are so heated guy.

Thousand needles, hated when they flooded it.

J Allen Brack is just writing his "You think you didn't and you didn't" speech.
---
Love the idea and where your head is at, but it goes against the premise of the project - which is to re-live the original experience as closely as we can. Nochanges.
---
The average player would probably be shocked and angry.
---
Some would probably think it interesting and enjoy it. Personally, I'm for it because MC is going to be laughably trivial, would be nice to have some minor thing to spice it up - but again... nochanges should trump my personal opinion about MC being boring.
---
It could tank 5man but not wonderfull.
---
Yes of course you get that?
---
What is different for warlocks of different factions?
---
Waste of time. Get the FP when there are quests.
---
That being said are we sure this isn’t just a beta thing?

Who hurt you?

---
your most recent patchwerk.
---
Thats a huge dps race and yeah you killed him, but comparatively?
---
At the very least it is optimal to have a feral as 3rd OT. One for the gear as you mention. But also a feral will do more as an OT for the raid than another OT warrior.
---
Monster Hunter World. Fantastic game IMO, I’m over 430 hours into it so far. Kinda burned out until the summer event starts, which is soon. After that I’ll be really burned out, which is okay because I’ll have to wait forever for the upcoming expansion pack to be released for PC.
---
I don’t really have a problem with him, but I also wonder if his job is potentially jeopardised by a successful classic launch.
---
Imagine being so sure something will not work at all and suddenly the sub base is more into Classic then Retail.. if I was involved in Blizzards executive decision i’d be wondering two things - is this guy so out of touch with players that he may be losing the company money? Also why do people like a game so old when he is being paid to make it better?
---
I’d hate to be that guy right now. I’m sure people are reconsidering all the work he has done.
---
Yup I’m one, just haven’t got around to resubbing yet.     
---
I just have to figure out when the name reservations start and I’ll probably do it then.
---
I'm waiting until the early character creation.
---
maybe you find something here
---
 [https://willitclassic.com/addons](https://willitclassic.com/addons)
---
agreed. Even if the tank given TF to is tanking only 5%, it will bring more DPS to the raid than in the hand of a DD
---
All of 'em.

You think you won't get TBC Classic, but you are not prepared.
---
Since half of TBC is i n vanilla anyway, just rework the content to fit Into vanilla
---
&gt; This isn't an absurd idea
---
yes it is. replacing is a pipe dream. having a separate server you transfer your character to is more likely if it ever even happens considering blizzard has already written classic off as a loss before it has even gone live.
---
I thought it was a cool drastic make over and it did make sense i guess. One of the cooler make overs imo.

So telling a guy it's not for pve and another its for resto.. are arguments too?
---
Fuck man. That sounds right...
---
Okay. You can think that way, and honestly if it weren't a possibility for pug bgs..it wouldn't be a topic.
---
I'm not saying your wrong.
---
I'm not defending it whole heartedly even...
---
I am giving it credit for what it is.
---
Do you not try and see the positive aspects of something? 
---
Can you maybe see in scenarios (that actually come up) that may be valuable?
---
Also when you shit on something.. you could also do what most people do and provide a suggestion.
---
I'm also going Troll but not for that reason. But yes I would say argue if you're in a PvP server go Wand Spec &gt; Spirit Tap &gt; Imroved SW:P &gt; Blackout &gt; everything else. Although get Mindflay when available. Even though honestly at lower levels pre-40 you don't need mind flay for questing IMHO. Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand, repeat and never go oom... (either heal your self every other mob or use PW:S)
---
Why? We want the game to be popular and successful
---
A lot of people in EU dont have it. Just look at this subreddit ä. Were you maybe in a stress test or something? In any case no it does not matter to me at all but he is saying that its all over the client but for many if us its nowhere to be seen
---
It's possible its just a beta thing, but for those that don't recall vanilla: Silithus was completely unfinished when 1.0 WoW launched in November 2004 so... I guess its possible that Blizz is emulating that with Phase 1 Classic.
---
Thanks for the info. Honestly seems like a waste of gametime though. I won't have time to play until almost a week after launch so 1 week of playing isn't really worth a name
---
&gt;suddenly the sub base is more into Classic then Retail
---
Literally don't care. All blizzard cares for is cash. They don't give a fuck if it comes from classic or retail.
---
FYI you can still abuse /sit (or rather /stand) it's just really impractical now, and thus, not really worth it.
---
Where can I find that map before you drew on it?
---
You didn't realize that talking about something that less than 1% of the playerbase even considered as an option 14 years ago required you to actually be a part of that less than 1% of players? Wow, that's just..wow.
---
I've forgotten and then talked to a GM and had them credited gametime to my account so they're pretty good about that kind of thing
---
Shit, then I don't have to roll Alliance to play paladin at some point? But it makes perfect sense that they are testing TBC, since the biggest part of porting Vanilla to the Legion technology is done. Omar is probably grinding Karazhan RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.
---
We call it #nochanges knowing Blizzard hasn’t done what we asked for years. This way we actually get #moderatechanges. Without #nochanges we’d be looking at “plans to introduce LFR”
---
Hey thanks for the spec think this is a pretty cool one i'm going to try it out as an endgame spec. I did make a few changes. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrsbbZf0tZVMGdMu
---
I personally went for shadow reach and improved renew instead of holy specialization and shadow weaving. What do you think?
---
Thank goodness. A player needing to read a quest or explore on their own instead of rushing to the next beacon. smh
---
That's why it's a private server thing.
---
You could have been polite about it and said „I disagree, I think precision is more important than riposte and remorseless attacks“
---
Then I would have said „Thanks for the input, but I think both talents are too strong to delay any further.“ So we would have agreed to disagree and everything would be fine.
---
I‘m sorry for you that your go-to behaviour seems to be acting like a dick.
---
Me
---
[2.Trade] [**Mydumbass**]: Guys, have you seen Mankirk's Wife
---
[2.Trade] [Supertankpro]: Why are you asking in trade?
---
[2.Trade] [Bankchartwo]: We're Alliance, you dipshit!!
---
It would be awesome. All the humans would be replaced with orcs or colour and they would all be gay
---
I quit in wotlk, may 2009. Resubbed yesterday in preparation for classic. Trying demon hunter while I wait
---
“For a limited time only we have half-price raid lockout resets, only $9.99” 
---
“Sword of one-thousand truths only $34.99 - best stats in the game”
---
Thats what august the 13th is for boi
---
They've already confirmed that we'll get the server names on the 13th or even earlier. Are you going to petition McDonald's to start offering burgers with two pieces if meat on them too?
---
People don’t like him because he started the YouTube channel to cash in on the classic hype after the shutdown of Nostalrius (he did not play on it). He did not play retail vanilla even though he claims that he did (he admitted on a stream (google it if you like) that his level 60 experience is from private server).
---
So basically alot of ppl think he is fake.
---
His content is still quite good, and the way he did the duelling tournaments shows that he is way more professional than other streamers. So even if he is «fake» he is still worthy watching.
---
 I say let them. If people use GS you know not to group with them because they clearly have no idea how to play Classic :p. It will be a nice way to tell the noobs from the actual players.
---
Thanks for taking the time on this
---
First of all we didn't film all our kills back then and we certainly didn't make them public because we weren't fucking narcissists, information was power so only idiots would make their secrets public knowledge. Second  of all we did a lot of theorycrafting and gained unfathomable amounts of experience and knowledge from our first kills in MC up until the end of vanilla.
---
Heck most of what we knew wasn't even covered on elitistjerks.
---
Meh, all of those characters have kind of become mary sue's in later years, I doubt it would be very interesting.
---
I've tried it and the results were sobering. Overall dps decreased, as the SoC proc rate was massively reduced. Mana wise it's quite the investment until you get the libram which reduces seal mana cost.
---
I've brought it up in the paladin discord, but so far nobody else bothered to do an actual dps test with it.
---
I don't need to reserve my names.
---
No one else can think of the names I can. Like my undead rogue Killerassassin. Or my undead shadow priest facemelter. I'm just the best at naming.
---
/s
---
DH is easily the most “fun” class.
---
In some way i'm fine with this. We don't want the "hype crowd" to come and cry because the game is too long etc...
---
There is gonna be players really interested in Classic.
---
&gt; and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest  
---
Yea, you do realize this here sets off a massive red flag for most people?
---
&gt; shorter if wall jump will work
---
It worked on beta.
---
u/3rek We all posted within a couple minutes of eachother because the replies were written simultaneously :p  
---
    
---
We didn't go "oh hey 9 identical answers to this question, let me add a 10th".  
---
The entire thread was basically just u/howmanymeninthenorth asking what Gear Score was at that point in time. Reddit doesn't update in real-time :p  
---
u/SomeDuderr Lmao maybe chill xD
---
plz no! anything but that!
---
This subreddit needs its villain.
---
Don't they remember the Blizzcon reaction when they anounced Classic vs. the "reaction" when they announced their new "major release" Diablo mobile lol ?
---
It’s one of the main things I can’t fucking wait to escape from. Being judged on a ridiculous number. A catch all meaningless idiotic number. Instead of bring the player not the class, retail is bring the number, not the player?
---
Gear score as a concept doesn’t get enough lip curling spit flecked hate on here. I would love it if they just killed it off as a concept in retail. People might actually look at the items and remember stuff they looted, like they used to. Instead you wait for your dice roll on the magic number. Soulless bollocks.
---
I would have no problems against gearscore if it were properly used. But it isn't. It **never** is. The problem is simply that gearscore says nothing about the actual performance of a character. And it all stems from raids failing. "We couldn't beat the ilvl270 raid with people averaging ilvl260, so now I will only invite 280 and up". I NEVER passed the gearscore checks for anyone, because they are oppressively overtuned. Until I did. I was in a hardcore guild. Had really good gear. One of the 3 best geared Mages on the server. And what happens? I joined gearscore gated raids of older patches. I just a bit above the desired gearscore for a raid that should require a way lower one. Of course: Nobody had any clue what to do and I did triple the damage than everyone else. It's just a joke. 24 overgeared nerds utterly failing at the easy dungeon.
---
Now imagine you are not overgeared as heck. You simply can't do the content. Go get that i300 gear before you apply for our i270 raid.
---
It's retarded.
---
Ah, k.  Thanks for the info I only got to test it a little bit on the stress test but this is good news.  I guess they optimized the new one or maybe the new client helps too?
---
Yeah I know and thats the thing, rets are meh. Pw you need overall around 400-500 dps for enrage so I beat that easily but warriors are just better.
---
Love it or hate it paladins don't come close. 
---
Overall damage I generally do a Lot more and get higher standings to my guildies and in a speed run (2h naxx or 1h aq) trash mobs are just as important.
---
Wotlk while I feel was inferior to BC, was a good ending to the wow expansion trio .  Wow had great class design in panda but everything after wotlk was basically garbage.
---
Makes alchemy less usable for druid then. Does potion and elixir effects still stick on, like the Trolls blood?
---
I'ts annoying not being able to verify stuff from Classic. I remember clearly myself that I was able to refill those boxes you got from fishing by looting every item except one, then keeping the box in your inventory when logging out for the evening. The next morning the box would be refilled. Only worked over nights, but I have found no sources that can verify this being a feature back in Classic.
---
* Can’t drink potions or eat healthstones while in form 
---
* Can’t drink rage pots for extra initial rage (though this has not seemed to affect me negatively ever)
---
New macro system allows for a 1 click instant debuff shapeshift form, drink potion and/or hs, shift back into form. So those 2 bullet points are outdated.
---
Also, here is the other half of the bullet points from Taladril on wacrafttavern that you decided to leave out:
---
* More inherent armor makes pure mitigation fights easier
---
* More inherent health pool makes high damage spikier fights require less consumes, easier progression for after wipes (because of lack of world buffs), or provide an easier barrier for entry (less healer coordination required)
---
* Provides a constant aura to 4 top melee that boosts their crit by 3%. This adds between 40-130 dps depending on the encounter and quality of melee benefitting from it
---
* Provides the most raid DPS increase compared to all tank roles (prot, fury, feral) (more details on this later)
---
* Can output the highest single target TPS in the game
---
* With a larger inherent health pool druids can be advantageous tanks for magic heavy mobs since magic damage is taken equally the same between tank classes minus defensive stance
---
* Can output excellent TPS against a single target even if not the mob’s focus without becoming rage starved
---
* Can use Faerie Fire as a pull. This instant cast spell at 30 yards is an excellent tool for surgical pulls – better than hunters even except for hunter’s extended range.
---
* Provides innervates to top performing healers or casters
---
* Provides a battle rez
---
* Provides excellent uptime of Faerie Fire since restos sometimes can’t and don’t usually bother
---
* Can’t be disarmed
---
* Can’t be polymorphed
---
* Can sometimes save self from fall damage death by switching to cat if flung high in the air
---
* Can switch in and out of form to remove slows
---
* Absorbs most gear deemed to be worthless as upgrades
---
* Doesn’t absorb tank tier gear, allowing more and faster gearing of other prots/furys (this is far more beneficial than you’d think to not need to gear up a whole tank with 8 pieces of tier gear for each tier)
---
* Can be strong but not max level DPS when not tanking
---
* Can switch gear and heal for heal intensive fights that don’t need extra tanks
---
* Can switch gear and dispel/decurse for decursive intensive fights (also has highest mana pool for this too with Heart of the Wild)
---
Overall - better to have in the raid as a dps/tank hybrid than a fury warrior that has to tank, better to have as a main tank for stuff on farm status speed runs considering the higher single target TPS, and also better on a few specific fights to main tank. They are not better overall tanks than warriors, but it is optimal to have at least 1 in the raid playing this hybrid role.
---
Even if you don't care about reserving a name, this is a great system. Everyone can spend as much time as they want crafting their characters face and details a few hours before launch and not feel like they're being left behind.
---
I started with replaying WC3 to enjoy the lore. Then I played retail with a starter edition, and it sucked ass.
---
Yesterday I caved in and started on a p server. And I just couldn't stop grinning. I am absolutely hyped for classic.
---
It's not. Mobs need to live for 30sec+ for the debuff bonus damage to outdamage simply judging SoR or SoC
---
I played hunter on pserver. Stopped completelly after clearing AQ40 when there is LITERALLY no loot for hunters. Sad story. No scaling after BWL xbow. So you are just tranq bot and puller after that point waiting for naxx xbow. 0 scaling after BWL for hunters.
---
Hey shizznitt, that's a good question and the answer is as mostly said correctly, that Classic is different.
---
1) 40-man Raids - You need to be able to distribute the loot fairly on one side, but most important is the use for the guild progression.
---
\-&gt; nobody cares if one didn't get any item after a month if you've only attended to 2 raids if there are people with 100% uptime
---
\-&gt; nobody cares if one didn't get the BiS item, while the other guy with same spec got 3 already if he manages to play the mechanic properly and you die first every 2nd pull
---
2) You have like 8 million DPS Players in that Raid, but only a few tanks. These guys need to be geared early, just as heals. You can lose 2 DPS, you can't lose a tank or heal.
---
Obviously this varies by the mindset your guild chooses to stick with.
---
Ah ok, so you guys were miles ahead of the rest. Good for you.
---
Meanwhile... Nefarian worldfirst Maintank... still no Jujus, still no stoneshield. Note even superior defense potion or Mungos.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ1OUeG1poE
---
Guess you guys have had the real worldfirst but you didn't tell anyone as you were narcissists :D
---
 http://lmgtfy.com/?q=vanilla+wow+mage+aoe+grinding+spots 
---
Google is awesome :)
---
Yes and once those 5-10% have had the time to catch up to the rest of us they're free to join in on the conversation. It's really funny to see them trying ahead of time though and making fools out of themselves.
---
Oh shit! I forgot about having to train new pets for new moves. Word how hunters were suggested for new players so much.
---
It's not prediction when you don't understand the question. It's dysfunction. It breaks the survey results. I can't have an opinion on things I've never heard of. What is missing is "no opinion" choice for each question.
---
Dying and running back to corpse precisely 30% of your time at 60.
---
You miss the unique type of interactions you can have with members of the opposite faction.
---
On a PvP server, you generally think or quickly get used to thinking that stumbling on an enemy means you're gonna have to fight. This means that whenever they don't want to fight or even more - help you out with a quest by for example damaging the mobs you tag and generally being friendly makes the experience this much more friendly and kind.
---
On a different thread about a similar topic I once read that the biggest difference between PvE and PvP servers is that the other player is given a choice of what to do towards you - and the fact that they have a choice is what makes the experience different because you're aware of their choice and you'll appreciate their good will that much more.
---
Wut? I might misunderstand something here, so I'll just clarify.
---
Prot uses 1hand + shield, always.
---
Fury can use both - 2x 1H or 1x 2H - while 2Hand in many situations outperforms 1H (you could look up the Advanced Classic Warrior DPS Guide on Classic wowhead).
---
Rolls should always been handled like this: MainSpec&gt;OffSpec&gt;Transmog/Prof/Gold. If you're in a party that needs a tank and you go for tank, even though your MS is DPS you should keep rolling MS on DPS and OS on Tank.
---
J. Allen Brack was right all along and I said this numerous times, but people are too hyped up and blinded by nostalgia that they think that just because the game will be brought back in all its old glory that it will somehow change the mindset of gamers nowadays.
---
Modern WoW (and gaming/the internet as a whole) has not been ruined by developers/corporations alone, they just reacted to what their (potential) customers wanted. It's a two-way street.
---
People are in for a rude awakening. Classic will be great in its core, but the community will absolutely ruin it.
---
The true "good" Vanilla experience can only be had if you make a private server that has some sort of randomized psychological evaluation test - something that big corporations use in their recruiting process - that weeds out anyone with the modern gaming mindset and doesn't even invite them in.
---
I think the best thing you could be learning about is Spell Ranks since this is drastically something that isn't in Retail WoW.
---
One of the most fun things about being 60 is going into contested territory and fighting other players. In a PVE server when you get that itch to fight the other faction you only have BG’s which are fun but offer a different experience than world PvP. If you like PvP at all you should roll on a PvP server it’s worth the lumps you’re going to take.
---
The firstkill was 10 month after release. Go trolling somewhere else
---
Indeed. I forgot about them, most likely because World Bosses will be farmed by the top guilds of the server anyway and I dont see myself in one of those guilds. Not enough time for hardcore raiding :)
---
Yeah I don't know about that. Any prove of that being legit and not being a private server glitch/bug, boost or increased EXP rate?
---
Some intern fucked up
---
WoW with RTX would be something else! After trying out Quake RTX I imagine something like MC would give me 5fps tops lol
---
Goldshire, **THE** place to be for quality roleplaying!
---
Lmao but how do you get yourself to see the BElf? Very vague instructions to see it in the comments here. The launcher? The launcher background is the Dark Portal. The in-game log in screen also has the Dark Portal.
---
How do you get this specific image to display?
---
That's just the reality of adding a humanoid race to the Horde.
---
People like playing human characters, there is no getting around it. All the statistics across WoW show this. You might be a snowflake rolling Tauren or Troll but most people just want to self insert.
---
Faulty logic but yes it is logic. 5 pounds of rock weights less than 10 pounds of cotton so it should hurt more to get hit on the head with 10 pounds of cotton right? That's logic too.
---
If you don't factor in everything and focus on a fraction of the full picture that's how you end up with assumptions that are so far off target that you shouldn't even had bothered in the first place.
---
...That was the most scuffed Konami Code I've ever seen.
---
I don't have a source on-hand, but I think Hand of EtO is set at ~1 proc per minute. :(
---
How are there lots of people, in one guild, who are all dead last for every bis item?
---
It's not retail people, it is zoomers specifically. Most of them will be new to WoW in general even, yet play all those other popular games (spotted some of that filth in this thread alone).
---
As a warrior pre TBC/WOTLK, your mobility is close to a post one (no Heroic Leap, no Intervene, 30s Intercept if you have MS).
---
If you are alone and you see a mage, run the other way.
---
Being good at his job isn’t about not making mistakes, it’s about being able to recognise them and take in feedback. He will only gain more credibility if Classic is successful. No use being upset about something already done - we have classic coming now so it’s a win for us.
---
Would have been 28? He died?
---
That's a shame at this age, my condolences.
---
I hope I can get some decent family value out of this. Our family is quite much spread across the country so we usually just meet up every year or few years with as many as possible. My brother and I played some games together, but while I like being competetive he likes to play around and do more casual/slow stuff.
---
Never played with my Cousins before.
---
As a Shaman, the casting animation for Chain Heal makes you look (and sound) like a Paladin summoning his Charger. Not very Shaman-like. And it's a spell you use a *lot*.
---
Yes, I see the point, it is a more lively interaction. Since you cant talk your only way to communicate is through actions. Definitely worth to think about it.
---
They dont but our government likes to do that shit here in Poland.
---
Because the majority of that time was spent leveling. You think everyone speed leveled to 60 in a month or even knew what raiding was when they started playing? The raiding scene took a long time to develop. MC wasn't even cleared until like 4 months after launch and the EU had barely gotten the game at that point.
---
Come back when you actually experienced it first hand back then,oh wait.
---
It's because the broadcasting/match events are much shorter/condensed coupled with the fact that the fandom is more concentrated in South America and Europe that I think less people request actual time off work. Take the 2018 World Cup held in Russia for example, where the matches were all held during tv primetime, not during traditional work or ZzZz hours.    
---
On the other hand, or foot, the Olympic Games have events and coverage almost 24 hours a day, while it caters to a 100% international audience, watching from all timezones, meaning if you want to catch your favorite event or just love following your country's representatives, there's a large chance that they're on while you're sleeping or at work. Unless you take time off :P  
---
it would be nice if an actual study had been performed, comparing the two events in this way, so we could have a definitive answer. But I don't think one such exists :p
---
Stick a Shaman with improved totems and Nightfall in a melee group and have him do the twist?
---
Not to mention that equipping high score gear to que then switch gear once in. Leads to ninja tendencies.
---
For me, the most fun thing about a pvp server is that when in contested territory, you can never let down your guard. If possible, you should look around frequently and be aware that danger could lurk around any corner. This made the whole vanilla experience much more exciting for me. I find questing and grinding mobs without any risk of player intervention kind of boring.
---
Monster Hunter World ^^
---
Big agree on the only reason to pick is for grounding reduction.   
---
I just try and see the positive of the other aspects too. My primary drops are a tremor and resistance totems, until there is somebody in the area. Or further utility is required.  
---
I flex to wall and skin on the occasion, but it's 99.99% the CD. 2seconds saves lives, and a lot of the time it's my own.  
---
I have been trying something similar to the utility you linked and my spec 2, in form of:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcZxbbZVchtVxqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcZxbbZVchtVxqo)   
---
After I raised the ghost wolf point prior, I thought about it and tried Earthbind kiting... it's actually very strong when you save 2s...
---
Have you found dropping restorative totems and mana tide totem hurts you at all?
---
Also haven’t sub’d yet. Was going to wait till the day before name reservation to do it - as I’m sure most unsub’d people will, *unless* it’s a requirement to be sub’d for the next stress test - if that’s the case I’ll resub early just to bounce around for a day or two
---
1. Hunter
---
Hunter is one of the few classes that actually have a full tier set (1 and 2) that can use the whole set! so if you will level slowly, and join a PuG once in a while, you can aim for the Tier peices and only have 1 or 2 players to roll against = faster loot = faster looks =) If a Pala or mage rotation is enough for you, a hunter is alot more fun! you need to focus more on your own rotation to maximize damage.
---
1. Mage
---
as a causal, having Teleport and Portals to sell, maybe even water and food (since a stack of food costs like 50s at high lvls) you could ask for some tips for your services. you can AoE a few lvls, maybe farm those mobs that drops Cloth and level Tailoring along the way. If you get ganked you can Pollymorph and run =)
---
1. Ret Paladin
---
all Hybrid classes do have to pay the hybrid tax.. you need ALOT of optimal items to really make your character strong. Ofcourse Prot and Retri works, its just a bit weaker compared to others. Bringing a mage instead of a retri pala (to get polly morph in instances for exampel) is probably worth more...
---
1. Shadow Priest
---
same goes here.
---
1. Warlock
---
Warlocks damage in the first Phases of content released will be lower, but with time (6 months after release) they will become absolut monsters, beefy tanky dotty fearing monsters. With Zul gurub patch you can buy BiS gear from AH so you dont need to spend time in a guild. you get the ranged battles you liked as hunter. you just fear if they get close. The Soul shards you make will still be in  your back when you log out. farming 30 soul shards doesnt mean you use all of them.. you could be late to  the raid and not summon all the SLACKERS..  only summon GM / Officers and Raiders and dont waste your time on trails =)
---
Idk, seems like a minor thing to me, just block him and be done with it.
---
Indeed. Didn't even know of the game beforehand, but the gamebox caught the attention of my 10 year old self. Spend entire ride home after my mom bought it reading and looking at everything on the box. Even asked my mom for a 60 day extra card before we left the store, was that hyped. Also cuz mom and dad doesn't trust or didn't trust online transactions, so only way to get gametime was the cards
---
Our shaman Discord has 2800 members and have great moderators. There are dedicated chats for all specs :)
---
Imagine at your job every two weeks you guys rolled dice to see who got payed. Now imagine that the people who won the last paychecks also get to roll on the next paychecks too.
---
Does anyone know if the Thorium Brotherhood quests are in present at Thorium Point in SG?
---
The answer is obvious - because they can find people with that requirement met
---
Also they are forming the group so they are setting up rules
---
Better get a paladin with hand of freedom to get it running savely.
---
\#nochanges! 
---
:D
---
That hasn't been enough for 10 years. It is going to be hard for us players to try and switch back to that. I'm hoping we can do this and we can all benefit
---
You're completely going to ignore the huge succes of OldSchool Runescape, or what? More people pay to play the 12 year old version of runescape than the "main" one.
---
They dont seem to bother because this cannot be played on a phone
---
Fine with me. Ideally, investors shouldn't even know Classic exists. Or they will start pushing to add stupid stuff to it.
---
That is super easy to do in the modern world with all the data availible though, and super powerful tools like github
---
Altoholic here. 
---
I leveled so many char I can't even count them. Only on offical servers, I currently have 23 chars, with 12 being max level of their expansions (80 DK, 100 warrior, 100 rogue, 85 drood, 80 mage, 90 hunter...) on two servers. I simply love the inertia of leveling a char. Like, you get 20, you finally start to have fun just killing mobs. 30, you go to STV and do wild PvP. 40, it's Tanaris time and hopefully wPvP. 50, you go in Un'Goro and also unlock most of the funniest skills of your class. And do wild PvP. And so on... On Pservers I also leveled many chars during BC on blizzlike servers before TLK came out and I switched to offical.
---
For Classic, I will main hunter, but god I wish I could play my drood and paladin rerolls as much as I'll play my hunter, but I know I will not have the playtime :(
---
We are here because of Nostalrius.
---
The reason they dont consider it as major release, is because the amount of people subbing just to play classic will make the numbers look way better for the next earnings call, since the both games fall under retail. Basically next time there's a earnings call, the numbers look way better and it will look like the retail game is doing way better than it in reality is.
---
Don't say that :( It hurts my head.
---
Because this is being treated like a major content patch. There's no retail product being sold, just more content added to existing subs. I do agree they should market this outside of twitch to the big gaming sites like IGN, fb/twitter users who follow any gaming and other gaming hotspots where there's a good chance people who have quit WoW long ago would maybe check it out.
---
Also over a month away. Would personally start aggressive marketing ~2 weeks before launch right around when early character creation starts.
---
Except this time instead of being set inside Azeroth it can be set inside Activision with every second executive spouting "They think they do but they dont" :)
---
By the time you're high enough level to do Library (why would one bother with Graveyard), you can get through WPL with relative safety with no deaths. Even alone. 
---
Use the road from the FP, then swim through the small lake - there is a way to get up on the other side, after that all you have to do is dodge 2-3 bears. The run from Menethil to IF is a low scarier than this.
---
I found my old vanilla case a couple months ago. It even had a old disk with a clip of .e getting my first mount that I used fraps to record.
---
ahhhh, top tier shilling
---
I'm stealing your "free toaster" metaphor my good sir.
---
he said a job, not three.
---
Nobody heavily advertised back in 2003... the internet was still dial up for most people...
---
I agree, any retard can play enough BGs and get gear gotta have skill in arena to get the gear..
---
Which one ?
---
Blizzard is going to break gearscore-like addons in classic.
---
You must just really fucking suck at PVP..
---
Anyone who knows what they’re talking about knows arena was bad for the game to introduce
---
is this 26.46 accounting for the extra mana and globals the shaman is spending to not do extra damage himself?
---
&gt;This!
---
my post says naxx+ gear is inflated
---
the aq gear is borderline okay
---
even zg was starting to ruin the balance
---
av, mc and onyxia is perfectly sustainable model, everything later is not
---
&gt;Jom gabbar
---
ZG sword/dagger is pretty much the same with both agi enchs. I dont like usable trinkets. Again DM+crit trink combo is better. Maybe use trinket and then FD and swap back to DM one.
---
Why not just use the FP in Un'goro though?
---
People who are so threatened by an update thing organised in terms of buffs,specs, consumables, loot distribution. It's hilarious.
---
There is one? Memory is a bit hazy
---
&gt; Because they do.
---
They don't.
---
&gt; All of those weapons have been changed to deliver the Elemental damage **as a chance on hit effect**.
---
The patch notes mention specific weapons, with proc effects. [Rohk'delar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers), for example, doesn't have such a proc and is listed on wowhead as "89 - 166 Fire Damage". It should be physical.
---
PvP server ALL THE FUCKING WAY.  Whats the point of a faction war if I cant slaughter the opposite faction?
---
I haven't played WoW since TBC but I am planning to start playing again (I have already reconnected with old guildies, we have started recruiting etc). With that said though I will not be resubscribing until "naming day". The modern game does not appeal to me.
---
Nah. Warlock Priest and Warrior will be my three WoW Classic characters.
---
Gs in wrath worked off item level. It added up the item level of each item you wore and that total was your gearscore
---
Don't worry, me and all my friends who are going to play haven't subscribed yet. I'll probably sub like 12th so I can download the game day before name reserving. I don't wanna support BFA.
---
you'll be missing out on the amazing world PvP that will sweep all the 50+ zones clean once the honor system is launched.
---
I've played both and can only say that I prefer PvP realms.  
---
not cause of all the arbitrary reasons people love to throw arround, no.  
---
I just dislike the fact that I can not kill someone when I want to.  
---
thats all there is to it really. PvE servers are as fun as PvP. the only problem is, if you are like me and want to kill people, you can't unless they flag themselves. which they hardly ever do.
---
don't buy that nonsense about world PvP being so amazing. it really isn't. it devolves into a one sided gank fest mostly. or worse, griefing.  
---
it has its moments, but if its not your main focus then you are probably better off going PvE.
---
as there are BGs and Xrealm too you won't be missing out on PvP.
---
choosing to play the spec, is "not trying" in a raid context.
---
Wow how many new classes are there now?
---
The last I saw was DK!
---
This is blizz like. Like in classic
---
The way it originally works meant that it would scale infinitely. Getting 100% mana regen from spirit for X seconds is insanely good no matter your level, as long as you're a class that stacks spirit.
---
This is my plan.
---
Alchemy is still great, buffs still stick in form, you can go out of form to drink health potions etc. Mostly specifically rage potion that is pointless
---
I've been subscribed for like 3-4 months too. I wanted to play the beta and the stress tests...
---
Well right now in 8.2 your bis gear isn't even from the current tier half of your bis items are from manapearls... "WQ/daily quest rewards" or the extact same items you've been wearing all expansion just a season higher m+ gearing is a disaster right now in current wow
---
Great idea!
---
I think I will do the same :)
---
Fury all the way is obviously superior. 5% crit from cruelty, 25% haste from flurry (that's giant), 30s 20% improved damage from death wish, more AP thanks to improved battle shout, 25% increased physical damage after getting critted, nicely scaling with AP bloodthirst which also heals.
---
What actually gives you arms? Deep wounds (like 10 damage per tick) from crits you will actually get less because lack of cruelty? Tactical mastery... do you want to kill the mobs fast or what? Why do you need to change stance exactly?
---
I have leveled multiple warriors to 60, have tested arms and fury and to be honest for me arms is just stupid. Maybe if you want to PvP some, mortal would be nice. Besides this the best talents in Arms tree are improved overpower which forces makes you switch to battle stance (which often ends up with wasting rage) having 3% crit reduced during to lack of berserker stance and... parry talent which makes you survive more during leveling.
---
If you want to kill things as fast as possible, which is what you really wanna do as a warrior there's just no other option than fury. Alternatively if you want to fool around you can go arms and toy with mobs with switching stances/harmstringing them.
---
Classic is not for earning money on the current release, that's why they don't even care to have a standalone subscriptions for it. It is an experimental project that will be shut down faster than it was developed if they don't reach their pre-set threshold of players.
---
Pretty sure there was one up north in Marshall's refuge.
---
13th of August is character creation day.
---
If this doesn't change, Blizz are idiots or intentionally sabotaging classic.
---
Ashenvale.
---
Runners-up are Tirisfal Glades, Hillsbrad, the Barrens, and STV.
---
Real life. Hopefully I can win at least one round before Classic launches.
---
Which item?
---
\#nochanges
---
Pet class or other ranged dps like ele shaman or mage
---

---
How? It's not that difficult to add up all item stats.
---
&gt; Do they only care about retail?
---
They care about money, and the money is on retail. Store mounts and other micro and megatransactions bring in more money than the sub fee. So much so they are making more money with WoW now than they did in tbc/wrath when they had 3 times as much players.
---
No
---
&gt; The imp has a limited mana pool (gone VERY fast). 
---
Ask for Innervate!
---
you occasionally die but then you corpse run into the dungeon...
---
Classic WoW is not for new players it is for people who want classic back - new people will come once the game comes out but it is up to the current fan base to bring it back.  Why would you advertise classic recreated WoW when you are already losing subs in retail?
---
Once again classic is for us not new players.
---
So I need level up my IRL bank clerk to level 10 too ?
---
...
---
Every other post is someone considering Ret lol
---
It's some pocket change for a name, no big deal. Mostly I'd imagine they're trying to get an early warning about how many servers they'll need.
---
Seriously, its probably the only zone in OG Azeroth world I had never been to. When I was leveling a new character like a year ago, it was exciting discovering a "new zone" again.
---
Obviously. No monetization meaning marketing is a waste.
---
I got a little misty and a big, dumb grin. Read a few comments, enough to dry up. The, that last line got me all over again.
---
Knock it off guys. I'm at work here
---
Oh the things I would do to remove modern warfare from my blizz launcher... and hearthstone F\*\*\* that RNG game.
---
*Orgri - finally we'll have our bank roof back to circle for eternity*
---
People always say that Tarren Mill and Southshore battles stopped, but I remember them happening up until the end of BC on my server. I played on Ursin US, which was medium pop pvp server.
---
todays wow players have no idea.  Yes you WILL get killed occasionally.  you WILL also kill opposite faction occasionally and every now and then you will call in your buddies and fight 4v10 and wipe them over and OVER because those ALLIANCE FUCKING SCUM ARE TRASH SHITTERS that keyboard turn and click skills.
---
Stamina buff by priest
---
well this checks out
---
I've been playing a couple of games. Detroit: Become Human, Crash Team Racing remake, retail wow, Rocket League(prolly my main game)
---
*Huh!*
---
Same. Trying a few things like how easy it is to mage a lesser magic wand and also wanted to play through Alliance zones as I'll be playing Horde on Classic.
---
I love having multiple alts and have settled on levelling 4 characters rotating between them with a main that would be a fair few levels ahead which I can use to funnel green drops to other characters. I'll have one of each armor type so most of the stuff I find will be useful and assist levelling of each class.
---
Gold is a subscription fee to play online, and it gives you access to some "free" games, for as long as you are subscribed. I mean it's not really free if you have to pay for it, same goes for Classic.
---
I am pretty sure Mike made him announce it to get him more in the eyes of players as not being the bad guy as he was due to take over Mike's spot.
---
I bet you did it by purpose.
---
Except reaching a certain amount of +healing isn't the same as gearscore. Enough +healing might let a shaman go 30/0/21 or a priest go PI Disc instead of Holy but eventually people will realise the game will have 6 raids forever and the progression will eventually stop. Blizz will break gearscore addons that calculate things like +shadow damage on a warlock into a singular number score on the basis of "addons that it is not enough to tell people not to get it if they don't like it because it becomes so integral to the meta" (paraphrasing from Ion himself, on stage).
---
i had 0 IRL friends that played wow when I played classic.  You MAKE friends on your server via guild, pvp, trade chat, etc.  If you cant be social and want a single player experience than you dont want an MMO... you want witcher 3.
---
&gt; Is it possible to edit and add a question how population of the world generally is on PvE servers?
---
Why would that differ for PvE? You still need the world to level, level alts, farm, gather and travel to dungeons and raids.
---
It's going to happen, at least as a personal-use addon. The best we can hope for is that it becomes taboo to talk about in public chat channels.
---
They are afraid to admit that the Classic is also important as a retail or even more.
---
I think that in the next year the retail team will be dismissed and reassembled.
---
Yup! Sounds about the same thing alright!
---
I stopped playing at end of wotlk, I resubbed for a chance to get into the beta (I didn’t). I haven’t bothered to cancel sub, still haven’t logged into live as I have 0 interest in playing the live version (so basically throwing away money, but since I play pservers, I guess it is kind of ok playing Blizz even though I do not use their services).
---
There is absolutely going to be a gear requirement for pugs in vanilla.
---
I have stopped after legion,  but I will be back for classic most definitely
---
In Legion at least hearthing to Dalaran took a full minute or two with a hard drive
---
Ultrawide would cost more than your entire setup
---
14 years ago nobody was close to playing at the level where paladins vs shamans would make a difference in a world face race.
---
Retail, starcraft 2, hearthstone, gmod, cry of fear, total war 3k, csgo, to name a few :D
---
Trying to give the games a run for their money before i spend my life in classic
---
You're gonna get 20fps at best, should have just stolen a NASA computer
---
As kring1 said, i don't think it differs much. It always depends how populated the server is in general. There can be dead PVE-Server just as well as there can be dead PVP-Server.
---
It is too early to be bombastic about how it will be on classic. There are so many ways boss armour/parry/resistance etc. can affect what is the optimal way of composing the raid. It would be foolish to say at this point that what works on a private server will work on classic.
---
Which will probably be BFAesque trash as the original visionaries have left.
---
All Druid problems
---
Hm, SM Ruin seems the most versatile - no soul link but you do end up with a decent PvP spec and the 2nd ideal raiding spec in one. Almost every warlock starting into the raiding scene will start off on a SM Ruin spec and then move onto DS Ruin eventually but every raid still will want one SM Ruin lock at minimum to stay in the tank group for that blood pact (maybe even put 3/3 improved imp and 2/5 SM even).
---
Here's a good guide for Shaman PvE healing:
---
 [https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman](https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman) 
---
And here is a nifty tool for calculating your downranks:
---
 [https://www.wowdownrank.com/#](https://www.wowdownrank.com/#) 
---
Things that are important to you as a healer:
---
Knowing bossfights to predict incoming damage (raid-wide / single target)
---
Coordination with other healers for whenever there is a lot of dispelling to be done and/or some healer is in need of 5sec-rule mana regeneration and you need to offset the lack of healing.
---
Switching gear for bossfights that call for a lot of healing throughput or mana sustainability
---
These points might become less relevant the more stacked your raid becomes. Early raid healing sure was a lot of fun and a lot of  decisions had to be made on the fly.
---
Unfortunately yes.
---
Just go Soul Link and respec to SM/Ruin. Don't die, you now have Sm/Ruin/SL for the low price of 50g.
---
Dear reddit community,
---
The torment is never ending. It has broken me enough to ask for your reflections on the dilemma of mine that is elaborated further below.
---
I’ve little experience with vanilla, but have extensively played TBC, moderate amount of WOTLK and tiny bit of Cata. The most experience I have is playing Priest and Hunter, but have quite good knowledge of each class bar Druid and Warlock. I’m mostly focused on PVP, leveling and dungeons, and a bit of raiding. I will be playing Alliance (to my great displeasure) with a number of friends who will be rolling DPSes. I will roll engineering regardless of my choice of class, and I prefer to have the capability of killing opposite faction on my very own in a timely manner.
---
For classic, I’m basically on the fence, in order of priority, between **Warrior**, **Warlock** and **Druid**.
---
**Warrior**. My very first char in Vanilla was Orc Warrior, with which I tried to emulate the legendary Blademaster form Wc3. Unfortunately, it was shortlived as after reaching level 5, I jumped the ship to Alliance Paladin due to a friend. In the past, I’ve leveled a warrior to about level 40 and remember seldom feeling boredom due monotonous rotations during leveling.
---
Pros.
---
*Symbolism of my very first class being a warrior (up to level 5 though);
---
*Always enjoyed the fantasy of fighting with orthodox weapons, such as swords, maces, staves and etc.
---
*I feel I would really like stance dancing, and the use of engineering on warrior will probably be the icing on the cake;
---
*Don’t mind the hard grind of Warrior towards 60, kinda prefer it for more RPG feel.
---
*Cons. Arguably the most populated class;
---
*Again, I feel leveling rotation might be a bit monotonous.
---
**Warlock**. Never played the class, absolutely never. Have no idea of spell rotations, what is the cookie-cutter, so to speak, leveling method and etc. Although I have some knowledge of an outsider, it remains a mystery. I don’t mind Soul shard farming and keeping them in bags, and don’t find them particularly annoying.
---
*Kinda digging the class fantasy, as in other games when playing against friends I enjoy taking the role of antagonist just for the sake of creating competition and conflict (in a good way, not drama, hah). And I feel a warlock would really fit into that theme.
---
*Absolute lack of knowledge of playing the class, and that’s a major pro. I feel I would really like the new experience that I so eagerly seek.
---
*All three specs are different and viable for PvP, which would keep me entertained whenever I would get bored of one.
---
Cons.
---
*Damn, I really do hate Alliance casters. Would much rather choose Horde for this one. I would play Gnome as Human race is yuck.
---
*Leveling is too easy?
---
*Not to keen on pet management. But that’s not a major con, more like a moderate con.
---
**Druid**. Just like Warlocks, I’ve never played a Druid. In the past I’ve always hated the idea of shapeshifting, but after playing Nidalee on LoL I’m kinda digging this idea. Also, staring at a never-changing cat/bear animation is not a concern. 
---
*New experience;
---
*Don’t mind healing, but not too eager to do it either;
---
*The class would suit the needs of my dps friends;
---
*Leveling as a druid sounds fun;
---
*I could be a freaking bear.
---
*Limited capability of killing an enemy player on my own at max level in a timely manner (considering I would be playing some kind of feral/resto hybrid and not feral focused solely on dps);
---
*Not being able to use engineering gadgets while shapeshifted.
---
I would really appreciate your help in presenting your arguments/experiences with similar feelings that you have experienced, and which choices or arguments upon which the choices were made in the past ultimately proved to be correct or incorrect. Or just general comments whether I put too much ground on certain arguments written above. Please, do share your reflections, I’m very eager to read them all. 
---
Thank you!
---
I had 5 fps i Orgrimmar back in 2005. I was molded in lag.
---
I never fucked a flying mount dude. That's gross.
---
I'd default to resistance and tremor totems too, of course depending on the situation. When running around in BGs I'd always have WF totem rank 1 for warriors. Saves mana and all. Other than that I think totems are mostly situational.
---
I'm not sure about dropping those restorative totems + mana tide. I always picked them for PvE. And they're not too bad in BGs, but by no means amazing. So unfortunately no experience with dropping those points. But in theory, 6 free points should give alot of options, since there are so many powerful talents. That's why I'm curious in what it brings in practice :) Maybe imma have to level my own shaman to test it !
---
Btw your build  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcZxbbZVchtVxqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcZxbbZVchtVxqo)  would be my starting point. It should be great in all PvP and PvE content (except solo grinding I guess).
---
Another memeish build to try out is (something like) this:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfuLb0oZxbbZVcbt0Lo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfuLb0oZxbbZVcbt0Lo). Basically ele/resto without the lightning spells but with enh utlity. I stole it from oldschool [Sham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aymQJv9v8jA&amp;t=129s). In my experience it's good for wPvP and duels and OK for BGs.
---
20 runs is a minimum of 4 hours due to instance lockout.
---
Don't underestimate the potential difficulty of playing a hunter, the class actually has a very high skill ceiling.
---
It’s still the same in live. Want to do latest raid on heroic or mythic? Link heroic or mythic achievement. Want to do that mythic+ dungeon which drops 400 ilvl gear? Have 410 ilvl gear and 2k io score.
---
Dota 2. Legend 7 &gt; Immortal in a few months as a challenge
---
Selling potions at torch 2!
---
Pets scale with talents - like priest's Power Infusion. That's right, PI the imp with black book up and watch the dps.
---
I have an add-on that Auto adds players to ignore if they talk about gear score in chat. For my play style it totally fixed chat for me .
---
Agreed, not buying into that scam
---
Eternal Palace is a decent raid
---
&gt; Nobody heavily advertised back in 2003 
---
If this isn't some sort of meme, that is possibly the dumbest thing I've ever read
---
zacklie!
---
Source?
---
Neither did I, willingly. That mechanic fucked every pvp player right in the ass.
---
I recall arcanite bars and mooncloth to literally take forever... Any transmute took quite Long though
---
It adds a lot of immersion knowing you are never save.
---
Don't think everyone attacks and kills everyone. It still really depends on what kind of mentality the other person has.
---
It can be frustrating at times but in my opinion even bad emotions trump having no emotions at all. For it is emotions that make the difference between living and existing!
---
\*laughs in hunter ammo and pet food\*
---
you dont need alot of hunters, agreed. But the ones you bring should play the optimal hunter specs.
---
xD
---
Uhm, you pretty much has to go down to HOTW if you want to tank.
---
11/40/0 if you want to be able to tank and do good damage when you're not tanking. 11/33/7 if you want to sacrifice your DPS for better tanking in dungeons.
---
You're much better off with just standard stam/def tank gear, decent spelldmg plate gear doesnt really exist pre aq40. There are very few exceptions on tank gear whcih atleast have some +int like the bile-etched pauldrons from dire maul.
---
Also consecration and your seals scale so terribly low with spelldamage that having 2-digit spellpower wont even result in any noticeable threath increase.
---
Key to maintaining aggro as a tankadin and at the same time your biggest issue is your mana. I've had much better success whenever I could keep up consecration nearly permanently by using judgement + seal of wisdom to keep my mana up, than when I used judgement of the crusader + seal of righteousness, which keeps getting recommended everywhere, but left me oom after \~20-30s into the fight. Also buffing everyone else with salv always has priority over any other blessing they would prefer.
---
Or just don't respec for frost when you go aq/naxx. Sure, you will do less dps throwing frostbolts in mc/bwl while specced fire, but does that really matter, when you have those raids on farm for months?
---
So pretty much the same argument there also is for offspecs, because their gear doesn't overlap that much with the pure dps classes either.
---
I mean, you complain about a ret or enh shaman taking your 2h weapon pvp, but ignore the fact that a ret or enh won't take the 1h swords every single fury warrior and combat rogue wants for pve.
---
We *definitely* had people selling gear in retail Vanilla. This is legitimately just wishful thinking on OP's part.
---
xXLegolasHunterGodXx
---
I think that most of the guilds won't allow HotW offtank. There're only 3 spots for tanks, and there should be better candidates. It's similar to arms offtank. You're sacrificing LotP that 4 people would benefit from for personal wPvP.
---
It's easier if you join as okay-ish healer, and then ask to tank something when stuff is on farm and doesn't matter.
---
HotW healing is a 5 man and a pvp spec. I wouldn't take one in my guild. On alliance maybe there is room for one. 
---
On Horde you stack resto shamans and there is room for max 2 resto druids (maybe just 1). I would never take  a 0/~30/~20 druid on Horde. Only a hot spec and maybe MAYBE a moonglow/NG /resto spec druid.
---
what took you so long?
---
Barrens for sure
---
I can confirm that, I played on a low pop pve server back in the day and it was ~70% alliance and 30% horde.
---
This was my pain for so long
---
I feel like you don't really understand Blizzard's financial incentive for releasing WoW tokens, and instead just blindly believed their virtue signalling.
---
Even if we assume that no extra subscription time is bought through the system (which would be very naive, considering that I personally know several people sustaining their retail sub on in-game gold alone) a WoW token is still marked up to £20 from the regular 1-month cost of £13 or lower.
---
Not only is it a huge mark-up for tokens compared to regular subs, but it's also using the players' desire to buy gold instead of earning it - resulting in more subs sold overall.
---
On top of that, gold sellers are still alive and well because they're much cheaper, so that argument really doesn't hold up at all.
---
This is all without even getting into the ethics of Blizzard literally **selling gold.**
---
I'm not your budyy, pal
---
I feel like im not true to myself if i dont comment every time i see someone bashing flying mounts, but as a true and dedicated vanilla fan, i think flying mounts was the best thing that ever happened in wow.
---
I have always been planning on playing a spriest but am now thinking holy pally. 
---
I will be playing casually and mostly doing PvP. I wanted to keep the option of raiding open (without needing to respec) which is why I am leaning towards the pally. 
---
I am just worried about having a healer main. Is it a pain not being able to farm or fight back in world PvP? Can't even go "that's it I'm getting my main" if my alts get camped. Convince me that it's not so bad.
---
Lol if you're playing with braindead autists perhaps. BWL is easy af.
---
To tank in raids, you'll most likely need leader of the pack to be optimal.
---
Anything up to that point, though, the hotw spec could work for either healing or tanking. And pvp.
---
Such a no! Trade chat will be so crazy
---
True, I assumed it would be part of the modern architecture but I can't think of any detrimental impact on the game by having it. I suppose we'll see what happens.
---
Get. Out.
---
going for the true experience, including server ques of 1 hour

---
TBC felt like a controlled game that is void of an element of discovery compared to vanilla.  The raid balance came at a cost.  Gameplay for each class was designed and carefully controlled by Blizzard.  Any time a viable style outside Blizzard's design was discovered by players it was nerfed.
---
&gt;  I’m mostly focused on PVP, leveling and dungeons, and a bit of raiding 
---
If your friends are all DPS I would say the order is Druid, Warlock, Warrior.
---
Druid: Versatile PvP class, very nice leveling, can go tank or heal in dungeons and I don't know anything about pugs but Druid is least played to that would perhaps help if you want to raid casually.
---
Warlock: Big bag of tricks in PvP, easy leveling, in my personal opinion (can only say  up to level 40) they are boring in dungeons - but you can summon and are not that common for raiding (this is usually even more true for Alliance)
---
Warrior: PvP will not be that fun if none of your friends is able to heal you, Leveling; same comment, tanking in dungeons is a lot of fun imo and for raiding I think there will be plenty of DPS warriors going around so good luck on that.
---
If you're looking for a class that's fun to level together with some DPS'ers and do dungeons and PvP with them you could consider Paladin. I am no expert but a lot of threads have talked about holy hybrid PvP specs that allow you to be a good PvP support as wel as a raid healer.
---
I think people just cant read to be honest
---
This is obviously not the case, and it's a bug on wow heads end.
---
I've got some old memory of Hinterlands being pretty empty of quests on launch, atleast for Horde.
---
I think most of them were added in a later patch, anyone remember/know if these will be in at launch of Classic?
---
I said it before. After the initial rush then the drop of player. Whether the game grows after that period depends on whether they will advertise the game or not.
---
Seems like the answer is not :p
---
Because you can make more people interested in playing it. That's pretty basic, man.
---
No but there will 100% be one availble. People will create one if Blizzard won't. There is armory for every major wow private server. Even vanilla.
---
0/30/21 will off-tank perfectly fine. Your main threat generation is Maul and whilst LotP is a nice crit bonus, it's not essential. The biggest problem with going a full tank build like 11/35/5 is that it reduces your effectiveness badly in PvP and healing. Losing out on Nature's Swiftness and Insect Swarm is a huge blow for PvP, and without Improved Healing Touch, Tranquil Spirit, Nature's Swiftness and Reflection, your healing will be heavily decreased. 
---
I'd say 11/35/5 would be fine on a PvE server where all you're looking to do is tank, but on a PvP server where you're looking to do Wpvp I just can't see it working. Whereas 0/30/21 will allow you to off-tank *and* heal in raids, whilst still holding your own in PvP.
---
Even if it is successful, they have no reason to add new content.  We all know they won't spend money developing new content when they have the golden trio waiting for them over the next 6 odd years before they worry about new content regarding classic and beyond.
---
Azshara, finally..
---
Thanks for clarification.
---
Rick and morty!!!! An episode of rick and morty where they morty doesnt wna go on an advanture with rick kz hes busy playing classic, so rick transport both of them into a dimention where the world is world of warcraft vanilla😍😍
---
Yeah, sure. Blizzcon demo and beta access for subscribes was also not a money grubbing scheme. There are excuses for each, but you need to be awfully gullible to believe it.
---
Those people are not desirable anyway. Good riddance.
---
That’s actually hilarious, I’m in a cutting edge guild and it took us until week 2 to get heroic azshara down and people are still trying to mandate it for pugs. That’s when you inspect them and see that they haven’t cleared it either and just laugh at them trying to get carried..
---
If its a short fight, give the top healers a LIM and tell them to use it once the demon is about to get to them. A lock R1 banish will land before it hits, but its safe.
---
Dude fuck that whole line of thinking. Men are allowed to have feelings, and those who are in touch with theirs are not somehow weak because of it.
---
Oh yes, my favorite zone in the game.
---
I understand your viewpoint but i dont agree that it ruined pvp at all. On the other hand, being able to fly above those beautiful landscapes, land on high hills you have never before been able to be, gave the game more RP feeling than any other aspect I think. I just loved flying over great fields and whatch the world under me. I truly felt magnificent riding a great dragon. I just loved everything about that feature.
---
And how would you figure out where that is?
---
You're right about that sort of price tag. I was thinking more around the 20 to $30 range. I just feel like the two games are so different I can't a large amount of people going over to retail who currently do not play the game
---
The discussion is on Feral DPS.
---
And it is op for every class at that point... in vanilla its still awesome in BGs.
---
Never encountered one ever. Atleast not in 20/25/40 man.
---
Did you miss the Balance part? Shoo
---
I'm in a similar situation, but I have 9 choices, could someone advice me which of 9 classes should I pick?
---
There are loads of retarded Hunters out there. If you are one of the good ones you'll be desired.
---
more than BfA I believe
---
The hero we deserve
---
It’s my understanding that Kevin Jordan confirmed on [this podcast](https://youtu.be/5-OSVVWQ_a4) that the talent was fixed so that the GCD for the imp will be 1 second when it casts Firebolt!
---
&gt;I am a casual by nature. I enjoy the journey much more than the destination in many ways. Oh, I also do light pvp every once in a while. I do like battlegrounds sometimes.
---
Then roll all 5 and see.
---
Sick man
---
I'm going against the majority and predict WoW classic will be a huge success even long term, sure, some players will quit after the hype, but I think for the most part it will be a huge success.
---
Like the amount of people I know in real life that will play Classic is absolutely crazy, I don't think I ever seen so many people I know in real life start the same game, easily over 50 people.
---
And people who often bring up the negative parts about vanilla and use it as a argument to state is not going to be a success and that most people will quit after the hype wears off are clueless and have no idea what they're talking about and I'm also convinced these people really didn't get the full vanilla experience, they might have played for a a couple of months and walk around acting like they know everything about vanilla, also people wont care about some negative aspects, they will play for the full experience, you wont go in and nitpick some aspects to convince themself it's bad, that's ridiculous. Vanilla is so much better then retail, like it's not even comparable and people will enjoy the game so much more, I'm pretty convinced vanilla will overtake retail in playerbase eventually.
---
Also, retail is absolutely garbage, like it's so fucking bad it's insane, it's not even a fucking computer game anymore, it's just some kind of simulator that has no meaning no point anymore, there's no scaling, no meaning, no challenge, no community, nothing, Blizzard have absolutely lost control over the game.
---
Hey I enjoyed black ops 4 or whatever number it was. for about a week. :)
---
I want this
---
Selling carries is 100% going to happen.
---
Refresh rate sure but not resolution
---
1TB NVMe M.2 drive is 90$.
---
I plan on it
---
Not comprehensive and not overly focused on specific match ups but here are some things that may be useful.
---
Mind Control: boats, zeppelins, blackrock mountain, pvp objectives (ex. Lumber Mill in AB) etc
---
Downranking: a lot of PVP will end up a mana game, especially 1v1, some examples below:
---
SWP, covered quite a bit here already
---
Dispel Magic, why pay for dispelling 2 when you only need to dispel 1?
---
Dispel bait, if they're spam dispelling then Inner Fire, Renew, PWF etc but obviously don't do this with PWS
---
Less commonly discussed tools/techniques:
---
Mana Burn can be extremely useful sometimes but watch out for anyone nearby who can counterspell and lock your Shadow spells. For the most part only against healing priests.
---
Power Infusion can be dispelled
---
Slow Fall/Levitate can be dispelled (primarily in BGs, specifically AB)... related: always carry feathers for your own Levitate, avoid fall damage while escaping or heading to a new objective (if you've got a DoT you may need to cast extra times or dispel yourself first), extra speed over water (AB or world pvp) or to get extra distance off cliffs (useful on all BGs, bonus for riding your mount off a cliff and casting in the air for extra speed... on WSG you can go halfway across the map). Can also target other friendlies
---
Mind Vision is excellent for scouting in BGs, doesn't need LoS, and can be chained. Find out where your tab-targeted enemy is, watch the action across WSG while guarding your own flag room, or even lock onto an enemy before they stealth, MV won't break. Vastly underrated non-combat utility.
---
No, "flying fucking mounts" a rare breed of fucking doubts that fly about, pretty scary and really ruined it for me...
---
I don't feel like shamans are good pvp healers. Maybe okay in AV.. maybe. I think you should just 30/0/21, or not play a shaman.
---
You should edit your post again, to read i want a PvE spec that is also good for PvP for resto shamans. 
---
&gt;EDIT: ** THESE ARE FOR PVP NOT PVE **
---
Unless you literally mean those specs are for pvp healing and you have no real plans to raid.
---
I feel like shield spec is actually rather nice. 5% mana verse that for pvp... shield spec.
---
I agree with the difference between the price of one month of game time and token price is higher then it needs to be, ideally it was 1 to 1.
---
Blizzard didn't create the desire to buy gold, and I feel that Blizzard having an option for players to trade gold is better then the black market being the only option.
---
My guess is that you'll get a decent open-world framerate if you run at 720P and lower-ish settings. Your system *should* be better than my laptop, though, so it wouldn't surprise me if some settings can be turned up to medium without much FPS loss.
---
Congratulations on being so enlightened.  And unlike you I have a good paying job so  not concerned with a small fee for hours of entertainment
---
Elitists Will run double raid groups to funnel Gear on mains, Gear will def be sold
---
I was listening to Giant Bombcast and Jeff seems to think “everyone” hated the beta and decided Blizzard was right when refusing to release classic servers. 
---
That’s exactly the oposite of what I have seen online. Outside of few exceptions beta was universally loved and people are excited for release. Is there some kind of shadow counter marketing we are not aware of?
---
you think we wont, but we will :(
---
You have to take in the cost of seal release + judgement, judgements are 13% base mana pool, seal of righteous rank 4 (level 26) and rank 5 is 90 and 120 mana. So you'll be spending around 140-150 mana if your say level 32 per seal release. Lets say your using a 1.7 swing sword since that's usually the average of what you get.
---
So if you pop seal of the crusader your able to get off 17 auto attacks, this is about 90 damage added on the approximately 255 damage from seal of the crusader, afterwards you then release seal of judgement at the end which is 57 - 64 + 80 ish?. You're getting a incredible amount of mana value in damage since the cost is the seals itself. With a crusader seal opening into one seal through full duration.
---
So for 90 + 50 additional mana your gaining a total of about 170 damage on top of the 310 damage, this is about a 50% damage increase easily and incredibly mana effecient. It just feels slower cause you have to wait out the full 30 seconds.
---
the only way you can kill faster is if you use seal of the crusader openings and just pump out judgements. But this is incredibly mana inefficient and depends on a shit ton of water, you'll be killing slow enough that this method will matter. A lot
---
We are going for a /roll based system in my guild
---
The rules are:
---
1) every raider makes a BiS list of items for each Phase
---
2) you need to be 80% attendant to roll
---
3) if your BiS item drops you and anyone else with it on their list rolls, otherwise it goes to upgrade rolls or off spec rolls and finally to dis 
---
4) safety nets:
---
- “important items” like Thunderfury get LCd 
---
- if anyone gets very unlucky with rolls (ie wins nothing for a number of consecutive rolls) officers can step in and award drops
---
These are good options.
---
Is that Pre-raid BiS? or The absolute BiS? Kinda suprised i don't see any Tier gear at all.
---
For Druid-tank it is very important to properly itemize.
---
In order to come close to the damage-mitigation of a Warrior-tank you need all the Rings and Trinkets with armor on them and you need very specific items for many of the other slots that have additional armor.
---
There's barely any item-progression for you in the entirety of MC and BWL. So you'll basically be in blues up until you get some really good upgrades in AQ20 and AQ40.
---
Once you have those you are actually quite viable.
---
The problem really is the time before. I tried tanking Hakkar as 0-30-21 with about 11.8k armor. I though this was decent. But the healers said they ran oom so much faster than with our warrior-tank. Experienced druid-tanks afterwards told me that 11.8k armor is way below of what I should have. We wanna be at like 18k+.
---
Good luck reaching Naxx
---
I agree that they're often out of touch but not in this case. Game marketing is mainly about streamers these days so i'd say they're fairly  in touch. It's the best way to hit the target demographic. Just look at how pubg exploded purely based on twitch streams and word of mouth.
---
&gt; I was a big fan of fighting 1vs2 agains a feral druid + another melee, as the druid died easily to blade flurry while you focused on the other one (granted, they might have been bad players, this was a long time ago)
---
Then the ferals were most definitely bad. Ferals are so annoying to kill and take forever. A good feral (or any class/spec really) will not just stand next to their mate to get damaged with cleave/blade flurry. If you attack their mate, they'll be in cat form behind you dishing out damage. If you attack them, they'll be in bear form tanking your hits for ever. If they or their partner gets low, they'll switch to caster form for a short time to get off a hot or even an instant heal and switch right back to their bear/cat form, depending on the circumstance.
---
Even 1v1 ferals are really damn annoying, it won't be any better when it's 1v2, unless of course you outlevel or outgear them substantially.
---
They talked about it on the last "countdown to classic" episode. And it's common knowledge amongst private server players. 
---
And the BiS list for dps warriors lists bonereavers edge even in the nax phase despite it actually not being BiS even in phase 1, but the list is made from private server data.
---
One of them is going to make a stupid amount of money (D: I) and the other (they think) won’t. 
---
Hopefully classic stays under the radar and blizzard doesn’t find out they can add a shit ton of MTX to it and make a quick buck.
---
Believe me, its not about money. Ill buy a another 35" 21:9 1440p when they get the HDR, refreshrate and new inputs that can handle better refresh rates sorted out.
---
For now, the 35" 1440p 100Hz Gsync is serving me well.
---
&gt;People who don't play anymore but still have an interest maybe will keep an eye on WoW and so will already know about it.  
---
&gt;No new person will just want to pock up Classic.
---
Those are some wild assumptions. The two people who are going to be playing alongside me in Classic had no idea of its existence before I got in touch with them and asked them if they were interested.
---
One of them originally started in TBC and hadn't touched WoW for years.
---
On top of that, the streamers playing the beta stirred up interest for the game to a lot of players who had never even touched WoW before. Just going by their youtube comments, I've seen several people who just picked some of their play up on Trending and have decided to give it a go.
---
If you have to make completely baseless all-encompassing assumptions about everyone to support your argument, the argument probably isn't that solid.
---
SM Ruin is OK for pvp, but you’d only spec into that if you were also raiding.
---
I’ve tended to fine soul link early game, then Nightfall/conflag mid game, then full deep destro fire if you get into naxx gear
---
Did you guys really get Brad McQuaid on here? Haven’t listen to this podcast before, but have heard good things and have been meaning to check it out.  Respect for crossing games and including some Pantheon discussion... will 100% give this a listen today.
---
I wouldn't invite you to our guild. Feral druid needs to tryhard to be a decent tank, super tryhard as dps, and anyone even thinking about tanking in pvp spec just doesn't have the right mindset for that.
---
I have mixed feelings about the meeting stones. God damn I wish they worked on private servers...fucking lazy ass people dont start heading to the dungeon until I'm already there.
---
Normal working people dont watch streams.

just browse by fresh you’ll find something worse in 5 minutes

Sorry, I just had to say it.
---
It’s raining notable names over at Countdown To Classic as this week's show features a bunch of epic one on one chats.
---
First, we hear from Madseason, of the immensely popular Madseasonshow YouTube channel, as he sits down for a tavern chat covering a variety of WoW Classic topics as we get a bit of a deeper insight into his thoughts on Classic and what makes him and his character tick.
---
Next, MMORPG icon, Brad McQuaid, stops by for a lengthy chat covering his thoughts on the state of MMORPG’s, game design philosophies, and some meaty chat another highly anticipated MMORPG that he’s currently working on in Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen.
---
After that, Athalus, the founder of WoW Radio, checks in to talk about the wild ride of setting up the first ever World of Warcraft talk show, discovering &amp; working with TotalBiscuit, and leaves with a fun announcement about his plans for Classic.
---
And finally, we talk with SneakyB4rd, who’s not a celebrity outside of the show, but it’s his second time on the podcast so he’s a celebrity to us! We chat about some of his favourite quests, favourite questing zones, and what makes the quests of Classic good or bad.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Chilling at the Tavern with Madseason – 4:10
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – Brad McQuaid on MMO’s &amp; Pantheon – 1:05:35
---
* Calling Countdown #3 – Athalus on the history of WoW Radio – 2:14:25
---
* Calling Countdown #4 – SneakyB4rd on Classic quest highlights – 2:43:20

If you're interested in giving it a listen then please do check the show out at  [https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/07/24/episode-114-celebrity-countdown-madseason-on-wow-classic-brad-mcquaid-on-mmos-pantheon-athalus-on-wow-radio-sneakyb4rd-on-quests/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/07/24/episode-114-celebrity-countdown-madseason-on-wow-classic-brad-mcquaid-on-mmos-pantheon-athalus-on-wow-radio-sneakyb4rd-on-quests/) 
---
I hope people will forgive the extensive chat about another MMO in Pantheon, Brad was someone I'd been busting to chat to, and in that one he drops nuggets about old school game design that I felt were relevant to the podcast, so I would say it's very much so worth a listen even if you're not planning on checking out Pantheon.

Cheers!

Teamviewer was a godsent. Connected to home PC and put it to que from work, so i could log ~straight in when i got home.

Yep, that's really him, I bugged him enough to finally get him on the show haha :P Thanks for checking the show out!

July 16th confirmed amirite boys?
---
You were a child. Children change opinions like underwear.
---
A grown-up individual, especially after his 30's, needs a cataclysm to change his opinions.
---
JAB's opinion on Classic is THE SAME as it was. The cataclysmic event for him to change his opinion on Classic is YET to happen.
---
 I will subscribe a day before or on launch day. Stopped playing a couple of months into WotLK, had played since vanilla.
---
 Regarding name reservation it's not a big deal for me. I had a fairly unusual name in mind, if it's taken which it possibly could be I will just add an extra consonant on the end. Not a big deal.
---
So basically, the dragonblight private server.
---
The general opinion is that spriest in 1v1 is a beast, shadow beast. 
---
Don't know about pala, nor the classes' farming potential, but in vanilla grinding dungeons/mobs isn't the only way to make gold. Herbalism stays competitive throughout the expansion, all crafting professions have certain niches, and playing the AH can be risky, but very lucrative.
---
Then it seems you will be trolling yourself.
---
I'm confused. I thought he said he wanted to offtank?
---
None of my friends and I played or even had heard of Nost at the time. The Blizzcon announcement is what got the attention of the mainstream audience. Now there's 10 of us who are going to play. Word of mouth and old friends getting back into it is going to be a huge boost to the numbers. Nostalrius' numbers are incredible for its time but I think they'll be a fraction of the real deal.
---
Fantasy handegg league.

Play the real FPL.

---
The issue is pure/high healing shamans are just not as good as the other healers at pvp. You ARE going for the snowflake effect. You may not have intended this however. 
---
That being said get more enh. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcZqbb0xxzZV0xt0xo
---
Basically hope try to be a poor man's pallys. You are going to be one but try (you get far more kite ability but less tank and less healing in pvp). It would probably make you best defensive healer on Horde and  as this is the only best shamans could even hope for i Bet some AV groups would want it for sure and in wpvp who knows.
---
People will *seriously* do this.
---
I'm 37 and I change my opinion about things fairly frequently.
---
I hate being wrong, and I'll be damned if I'm going to be wrong more than once about the same thing.
---
On a side note though seal of the crusader at rank 1 is mega garbage, its really bad for mana, rank 2 is fine and rank 3 is when it starts getting good.
---
Y tho
---
The main problem with gold buying was never that it's unsafe - that's just a consequence for doing shady dealings - and this unsafe aspect of it is still thriving with the popularization of things like selling runs or mounts.
---
The reason buying and selling gold is a bannable offense in nearly all online games is that it jeopardizes the integrity of the game.
---
Whether it's Blizzard or Xiao selling you the gold, and whether they steal your account or not, buying their gold is still you paying for an unfair advantage over other players. 
---
Blizzard simply found a convenient way to integrate it into their own business model, under the guise of doing it to help players stay safe.
---
If you are undecided because of the looks, then just look at the racials: Orc racials easily outshine the undead ones, both in PvE and PvP. The stun resist is really strong and since the PvP trinket can remove fears (and similar effects), but not stuns, the resist becomes even stronger in comparison.
---
Ill subscribe on the day i can play. Dont really care about name reserving. I can always add a character or 2 or mix up the spelling.
---
I really dont want to convince you at all. All im saying that being able to fly on a magnificent Netherdrake (still my favourite model) above the land, visiting floating islands in Nagrand or any other zones gave me more ingame pleasure than anything else.
---
But we do play games....
---
aka flying fucks
---
which i don't give any about tbc
---
The dps hit in fury prot is quite large. If you're not offtanking the raid, you should be 17/34, and it's arguable that you should be even if you are offtanking, in some raids anyway.  
---
There's no such thing as 'threat aware' dps in 5mans in my experience however. 90+% are either fairly casual players or think they're too pro for the content, and they will get you killed repeatedly. So you can tank without defiance, but it's like pulling teeth.   
---
Given that conflict, I could see fury prot being ok if your guild doesnt mind you being consistently lowest warrior dps, and it would certainly be ok if you're tanking several fights. No tac mastery takes some getting used to, but it's actually not that bad, and the gear requirements aren't really any harder than full prot. You need some hit if you want to dual wield, but the spec works just fine with a shield on.
---
Faces and Details? Theres only like 5-6 options each?
---
You may need to see a doctor for that.
---
&gt;Thanks mate, I was very undecided about choosing PVE or PVP. I played on a PVE server my whole life,I'm not really interested in WPVP. I mean, I like BG's, but that's it.   
---
But I still had this fear of missing out by being not on a PVP server.  
---
But nope, cozy PVE realm again it will be :) It must be so frustrating to be ganked, I just don't want to be annoyed when leveling.
---
I honestly don't know how much cata changed the zones since I only leveled through them once after cata but many times before.
---
'Reaching Naxx' can be done even with the most casual guild, all it takes is time.  
---
Clearing Naxx on the other hand...
---
I'm sorry but this comment hurts physically
---
I started in vanilla on a PvP server, but when I re-rolled across I went to a Normal server.
---
I loved world PvP, but once they incentivised it I lost interest.
---
The only thing you're going to miss (if you even care) is being able to kill people when they're being annoying in the world.
---
The thing is, EVERYONE knows the fights inside out. Its not about skill level then, in traditional sense. The phases are supposed to be quite long, so gearing isnt really a issue either. Sure, you might get slight edge if you do 2-4 split raids in MC. Every hc guild is going to do 4-5 onyxia per reset. 
---
Its about the ability to kill bosses and more importantly TRASH with the best skips. Keep all ppl alive in every pull so you wont loose world buffs.
---
The question rly is, who is going to run under Methods name in Classic. The same guys going for WF right now ? Or purpose build and reqruited ppl from the top private server guilds ? If the latter, you can call it method, but is it rly ?
---
Looking forward to this week's episode. Mad is one of my favourite tubers and I'm so keen to hear Brad's take on the (evolution and?) current state of the genre.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Well, the problem is that the investors will ask why Classic wasn't released year ago. So, it is either LACK of vision from Blizzard's WoW directors (which is bad), lack of understanding the market (which is also bad) or INTENTIONALLY delaying the product, for personal gains (which is really, really bad).
---
There isn't any good outcome for Blizzard's WoW directors when Classic proves to be a massive success.
---
It is THEIR job to be on top of things. If they aren't, the REASONS what they aren't is irrelevant for the investors.
---
What they see is that Blizzard have FAILED, for YEARS, to bring in revenue.
---
It doesn't matter why. It only matter that the investors lost money, for YEARS.
---
Male or female, human, warrior, mining, blacksmith
---
Cant go wrong with either to be honest. Both top tier. Whatever you enjoy more.
---
# changed my mind for what class to play - minor question!
---
📷
---
So a few months ago I made a decision to roll mage over pally in classic wow. Now I changed my mind because of the group which I am mostly going to play with better suits a pally. Our main focus is PVP but we will also be raiding.
---
Now I already found a spreedsheet which gives me a lot of information about BIS raiding gear and stuff like that. I also found a good lvling guide as far as I can judge this.
---
There is only a small question Which I am still not sure about.
---
@ lvl 40 you get a "free" mount as a pally, but this free mount is a spell cast.
---
Now I am planning on lvling through the night elf area to get my self to exalted because I still have a hard on for the sabers since I was a little boy of 14 years old back in the day when Classic wow was retail :D
---
So the pally mount being a spell does this mean if I want to go for a lvl 60 saber mount I am still required to buy the (without discount 100g) for the lvl 40 riding skill?
---
Original movie looked absolutely stunning. Definitely had a whole bunch of resources poured into it.
---
And yet the movie was terrible and did not do well.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
About 3 times more people, which is quite telling.
---
It will be the same, if not better, with Classic.
---
3-4 times more players than Retail.
---
Bank on it.
---
&gt; Faces and Details? Theres only like 5-6 options each?
---
Yeah, and if you are making a human male your face is still going to look like a potato.  Potato with a mustache, potato with a beard....
---
I could not recommend Josh's podcast more. You'll get hooked like me Be find yourself trawling through the 100 episodes!
---
Good fucking riddance. That and "link achievement"
---
But it hasn’t earned anything yet?
---
the spell comes with the riding skill :)
---
Just don't do: Retribution Paladin or Shadow Priest
---
If you are casual go Mage and if you don't like mage go Lock.  You will get group invites and raid invites and they are good levelers. Hunter, ret pally, and shadow priest will not find casual raid spots unless you want to put some effort in.
---
Ar you referring to the later FP at rebel camp in STV? Because that was never in Vanilla, I believe
---
Badlands I believe Horde has a FP.
---
Ele shaman in classic, nice lulz.
---
Imagine playing anything but a resto shaman end game.
---
Heroic is horrible, you run it while leveling and then run it again while gearing up for over/pvp. But you already know the mechanics, the layout, the secrets, the lore... It's just reusing content that was originally meant for other purpose. They where getting lazy in TBC....
---
There is a concern for an initial rush on the servers. And an unstable population. Perhaps there waiting till after it’s up, running smooth, before they start calling for more players.
---
I am a veteran indeed. Got my scars from Vaelstrasz still. So many wipes.
---
You left out triceracop and daewoo lanos.
---
So many items had such unique "on-equip/on-use" mechanics, it would be hard to quantify them.
---
I think a better option would be get the top 20 BIS item list for each slot/spec and then its position in the list is your score, lower being better. So if you have the 5th best weapon and the 2nd best weapon drops, that's an upgrade for you, but if a RL could see how it affects everyone that could use it, like on his/her tooltip, i think it could be pretty valuable. 
---
I have no doubt it could be abused to all hell too by the pug community, but yeah it could have pros too.
---
I think warrior would be a good choice, if you still don't know what class to play.
---
All those hours farming goretusk liver.
---
I don’t think the private servers lot will last, why pay to play a different game than play the one you’re familiar with for free?
---
&gt; The good news is, Classic uses very little system RAM – roughly 250-750 MBs depending on the zone/location. 
---
I forgot to check that in Beta. Thats amazing news if true. I've been testing out 5-man multiboxing on retail client lately, it takes roughly 2GB of mem per client in orc start area. Had to increase my swaps file size to it NOT to crash with 16GB mem. If mem usage is half of what retail does, its going to make things so much smoother.
---
Not a peep
---
Wow, thanks for the detailed answer!
---
Yeah, those poor dirt Europeans, Canadians, Australians, Japanese, Koreans...they can barely scrap a dinner every 3 days, how on Earth will they afford $15/month....
---
Use a dice. Roll again when it's a 6.
---
If your first reaction to rolling a specific class is a slight sense of disappointment, strike it from your list and roll again.
---
That's basically what I've done to decide between priest, druid, mage and warrior.
---
This is imho the best way of making decisions that seem really difficult. When I mentioned it before someone said there's even some scientific studies and a name to that method but he didn't remember the name.
---
&gt; 2 of them are quest rewards
---
1 of them. Bonebiter. Yeah, technically also Whirlwind Axe, but at server launch you are not going to get WWA at lvl30.
---
So it's basically Bonebiter. Which, by the way, is the reward for completing all of the Scarlet Monastery wings. By the time you do Cathedral you're almost 40 and going arms anyway.
---
None of this proves anything. You're either going to farm for dungeon drops (which is not optimal) or going with whatever weapon you can get.
---
Well, it looks like you are trying to decide between races, save the shaman or priest question.
---
In this case you gotta know there's nothing objectively better, so we can only give you personal preferences. 
---
I don't like Humans, even less so 3 of them. Also, while I like Orc for several classes, UD girl warlock is one of my favorite race-class combos. Orc warlock otoh is just bad aesthetically. Finally, Orc shaman is an immortal classic - another favorite of mine. Then again, you want to play a Tauren, so I don't think I'm the right person to listen to as I can't stand that race either.
---
I mean i think so also. But i am pointing you you cannot get that talent and be an ele shaman. Which people were arguing can totem twist.  So i 100% agree and in fact say this if you want a totem twister your options are enh shaman or late game resto shaman (or a resto shamans using very low rank heals to save on mana).
---
I'm not sure if it is for sweeping and whirlwind, i've seen some posts say ww is not increased.
---
Obviously cleave's intial hit is increased, but the second hits radius might not be, same for sweeping.
---
Ah well, our only true hope besides a video from 2005 is testing it on launch, but having to level a char up during the rush just to see if the mechanic works or not is a pretty time consuming gamble.
---
I plan on having dps ferals, boomkims and rets on my guild.
---
That being said, they'll need to put extra effort in consumables and pre-raid gear, and be ready to heal if really needed.
---
If you're competent, you're in, but don't expect me to be OK with you dealing less damage than the tank while still refusing to heal or innervate others.
---
I think this point of view shows a poor understanding of the industry. Unfortunately large games companies will rarely put time and money into a project until they have measurable data to show that people are interested. The same goes for investors. The decision to not make Classic sooner is down to a lack of data on Blizzards part. 
---
I can understand how it may seem like everybody wants Classic if you are part of the Pserver or Reddit community, but the fact remains that it is still uncertain how successful the launch will really be. I for one am super stoked but I haven’t played since Wrath - I may get bored of the game in a few short months, and so might many other returning players.
---
Happened in vanilla and will 110% happen on Classic.
---
I'm talking about a level 30 spell because respeccing at 24 for a marginal dps upgrade at such a low level is in my opinion just dumb advice.
---
Let me put it another way so you see why I think it's wrong.
---
When people ask what spec hunters should level as, they will always say full BM and then some points in MM. 
---
Theoretically if we applied the same measures then you should only put 5 points in BM then put 7 points in MM and then respec at level 22 to go full BM. Sounds familiar right? Yet you don't see people telling new hunters they should follow that build because at that level it really doesn't matter.
---
You could even say that locks at 50 need to respec again to a DS spec to ledge farm brd and lbrs(+dm) for max xpgain but I don't see anyone recommending that while it would shave off a lot more time than an imp imp. 
---
Perhaps I've already said way too much over something so trivial but minmaxing should never be a thing at such a low level, especially not for people new to the class.
---
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
---
Truth is you can run up to roughly +10 easily in 400ish. And unless you are a dps (which is abundant and of low value) people are going to take you.
---
MC is fun because you do it as 40 People. Even though the machanics are easy - it makes it difficult because 40 People have to do it.
---
For proper guilds that is easy. For pugs it is fun.
---
I honestly couldn't care less about the design of MC but why make it unnecessarily difficult?
---
Why do People Keep coming back into the reddit asking if changes would be okay when the past 2 years most People in this reddit were trying to Keep the game as vanilla as possible.
---
Just no - go to retail and propose your ideas to Blizzard and People will be happy.
---
Also you could go to /r/classicwowplus
---
&gt; 11/40/0 if you want to be able to tank and do good damage when you're not tanking. 
---
You won't be doing good damage without Furor.
---
I hope it stays niche as fuck, like Starcraft remastered, because if it doesn't, then no wall can be big enough to prevent fucking Activision from shitting all over it to make extra money off of it with all the predatory schemes that are to be found in all of the other damn games on the market today - and retail wow.
---
While I agree its a cool feature. I felt like it destroyd world pvp for my part atleast. If someone was trying to kill me as a druid I could just dash away, shadowmeld to drop combat and insta flightform away.
---
Those new games re release ever two to one years
---
If you can heal it instead that is still better for the tank. Big punch = lots of rage :)

Sound like you got alpha hierarchy boned.  I hate guild councils, and yes Rhok in vanilla is the highest prestige.  I got kicked from a guild one time for bidding all my DKP on Drake fang talisman.  All the dumb rogue bitches on the guild council couldn't take it when a hunter denied them just 1 item they highly desire.  I logged on one day without being in the guild, with no good explanation.  So let's just hope people can get over their dumb mentality.
---
Sadly back in vanilla I was one of the few hunters that realized that dragon stalker was only 5% better than giantstalker and cryptstalker was maybe only 10% better than that.  So I bid all my DKP on other things. Hunters do scale with raid armors, but mostly regarding survival builds.  Sticking with marks will have even less impact on better gear.
---
The Second Coming of MMORPGs.
---
Mum’s the word.
---
I didn't actively follow the beta. Can you reiterate on what you mean with "hunters aren't fixed"? Were there some problems?
---
This!
---
Also there's A LOT of mediocre gear in the early raids. Most classes don't even benefit from their full tier sets.
---
Good loot is scarce, you can't just give it to random people.
---
If you think character creation will be soon then the realm names will be announced sooner.
---
I could totally see that.  There are right and wrong ways to handle such a thing, but I'm not sure I'd trust Blizzard to do it the right way.  Not in Vanilla, and certainly not now, given their history of changes.  There's almost no way they would do it without the whole thing being a massive nerf, somehow.
---
Hahah yeah this is too true. I power leveled through basically all dungeons from 15 to the current expansion, never touched places like Desolace or Felwood. Don't even know how they look like today.
---
 The Bittersweet Illusion of Nostalgia
---
The whole point of re-releasing classic in blizzards eyes is to generate massive hype and hoping for massive profits with absolutely minimal next-to-none investments. Marketing and advertising has become much more expensive these days.
---
These days for proper marketing you need an entire team of Hipsters and sjw's with various degrees and masters in marketing and finances, discussing and debatting their marketing strategies back and forth for weeks and months while constantly keeping everyone up to date on social medias. Also a marketing team needs to consist of atleast \~20 members, equally covering as many different ethnicities, genders and mental disorders as possible, which is the first and most important step to improving your corporate identity.
---
I don’t think that’d happen because it’ll be months before casual guilds are MC and the strats for the raid would be know by then. It’s yet another reason why changes like this would never happen.
---
I don't even want to imagine the shitshow in your guild after 3 weeks of raiding...
---
For non-sportsy brains: how do Fantasy Leagues work in Football and how would that translate into WoW?  I just imagine dream teams with ideal class combos for dungeoning/raids.
---
Rogue, Druid, Mage or Paladin?
---
I started WoW at the tail end of TBC and played Rogue. I loved the class quests, the sneaky sneaky nature, the more fast paced action style combat, the meter competition. Even the act of brewing tea and poisons was something I loved about the class.
---
I played 1/2 Wrath as Rogue and then levelled a Disc Priest which I played for the last half. 
---
For Cata I played Priest but soon got bored of the expac not returning until halfway through MoP. I transferred to a PvP server decided to play Rogue for this and it was great fun, but the expac was meh, and quit just as WoD launched. 
---
I then played GW2 pretty religiously until now, but in WvW (a kind of world PvP with big zerg and seige battles for those who don't know it) and played a caster (Elementalist) which is primarily a glasscannon spec, but I have done healing on it a fair bit too.
---
Now I'm back for Classic as my guild is reforming and we are going Alliance PvP server, but I'm in a bind as to which class, race and professions to pick.
---
In a bid to find what I like in Classic I've been playing on a pServer to get a basic feel (I know it's not the same) and found that Rogue may not be for me anymore, but here's what I've found so far, hopefully you guys can advise:
---
**Rogue**
---
Pros:
---
* Faster Action combat
---
* WPvP masters
---
* Apeals to my competative side
---
* Stealth for choosing fights
---
* Nostalgia
---
Cons:
---
* Hard to level (on Pserver I'm having a real hard time with even low level mobs if aggro 2)
---
* Slow stealth
---
* Millions of the buggers
---
* Only DPS which gets repetative
---
* No self heals only food/pots etc
---
**Druid**
---
* Easy to level (although I understand pServers got this very wrong, so maybe not a pro)
---
* Cool Flavour to it 
---
* Early speed increase without mount
---
* Heals
---
* Nelf
---
* bad healer at endgame so no meter topping competative side
---
* Spend most time as a bear or cat instead of as character (although... Nelf...)
---
* Hard to perform well with endgame in all modes
---
**Mage**
---
* familiar with glasscannon
---
* AoE farming like a boss
---
* Free food and water
---
* portals for gold
---
* Boring rotation 1 1 1 1 1
---
* Not very interesting "flavour" to the class
---
* wPvP target for every rogue in a 20 mile radius. Fine if same level and I got mana/cds ready but explode if not
---
**Paladin**
---
* Interesting "Flavour"
---
* Low stress levelling
---
* Lots of oh shit buttons
---
* Easy groups as healer
---
* Tops healing later so competative side sorted
---
* Free 40 mount!
---
* Slow levelling
---
* Might get boring with whit damage and keeping up blessings etc
---
* WPvP can be tough once big CDs are gone (long CDs)
---
* Only Healing at end game in all modes.
---
At the moment I'm leaning towards Pala. I do love healing just as much as DPS, so that's not an issue.
---
Race preferences are:
---
Human &gt; Gnome &gt;&gt; Doorf &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NElf
---
And which Professions would be best for the class you recommend?
---
I'm likely not going to go big enough into PvP to warrant engineering, but maybe I'm wrong.
---
Thanks for taking the time to read and even bigger thanks if you give feedback/ask questions
---
Druid should definitely get nod.  Have pretty much everything you need including the ability to peace the fuck out if shit really hits the fan.
---
Bruh
---
It won't matter for you guys. As others said you meet up at level 10 anyways. There are some min-max things (f.e. caster going Troll instead of Orc) or whatever kind of discussion you can have. But those are differences of like 1-2% of damage.
---
I will subscribe on the day of the launch. No reason for me to pay for it since I'm not playing normal Wow.
---
Someone will be able to develop a gearscore addon that calculates potential dps/hps/mitigation pts.
---
Thank you for commenting friend =D
---
or just use [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room)
---
No raiding guild, EVER, rolled for items in Vanilla.
---
Good question, feels like WIBTA sub meets Classic WoW sub.
---
1.) Don't be a pussy. If they want you to tank and you're fine with it, demand the spot for yourself so you can stick to it.
---
2.) If a guild requires you to switch for its progress you can simply demand the gold. If they aren't willing to pay you should simply not switch (and look for a new guild 'cause these mofos will definitely look forward to replace you).
---
BG/NB reporting in
---
Shout out to GDKP
---
Unsubscribed since 2010 here.  I was actually assuming people like us were the norm.  I didn’t realize retail still had a big following.
---
Why sabotage an investment of time and money?
---
Some people have tried to use the fact that the beta died in the last two weeks to argue people got over it fast while ignoring that the beta was tiny. There weren't even enough players to half fill a server at it's peak active because so few were invited. Combine the limited players invited with  the fact progress would be wiped as well as the cap at 40 for weeks and of course people would get bored.
---
Some staves are awesome for warrior while leveling. The deadmines stave and mauradon stave
---
I am not going to doubt that some form of [raider.io](https://raider.io) will be released for vanilla or some similar addon to be able to tell a good player from a mediocre or bad player.
---
Plan on finishing Witcher 3, Inquisition and Original Sin 2 before the release. Also Dragon's Dogma is in backlog, though still have no desire to buy it.
---
r/ClassicWoW: "REEEEE WHY DID ONLY POPULAR STREAMERS GET BETA?!"  
---
Also r/ClassicWoW: "WTF? Why doesn't Blizzard ADVERTISE?!"
---
I was thinking some like Buttpounder69
---
I almost wish they could segregate the servers somehow.  For older/young people or whatever.   Maybe by length of subscription.  10 years has their own server.  That'd be cool I think.
---
Low HP might be a sign of being geared towards max dps.
---
In vanilla I played on a new PvE server, it was never hard to find PvP, auberdine, astranaar, x-roads, sentinel hill, etc. Often I would start fights by attacking towns until people turn up. Only problem was DKs but once I hit the rank I wanted it stopped mattering
---
i need to not get ganked into quitting while lvling my warrior
---
Don't be fooled, pretty much the same will happen to Classic. It happens to the vast majority of games, and a 15yo MMORPG is a especially serious candidate for that. That is why Layering is not the worst decision.  
---
But even if the population goes down from 3 million to 300K, what game developer in this world would hate to "sell 3 million copies at $15" with very little development cost?  
---
Well, all I need is one 3K population realm, so whatever happens is fine.
---
I remember starting wow as a dwarf, reaching Loch Modan and thinking to myself "wow this game even has grass" such a silly thought but I could never forget it
---
Kinda like a specific place where everyone could go to sell and buy, kinda like.. an auction house or something
---
You wouldn't sacrifice around 1000HP as a WotLK era feral in exchange for having unimited energy? Mate, that's worse than being a keyboard turner.
---
I'm from the EU, and I have it in my launcher. Have had for a while, even without a paid subscription.
---
Using a WoW token for your sub actually nets them more money than paying a subscription fee. Regardless of which player is paying the actual cost of the token.
---
White damage from your windfury or DW setup just as I mentioned, it's a big portion of your threat. To discount white damage just because you also cleave is the difference between letting 1 mob hit the rogue and not.
---
It's quite a bit of threat to proc WF with a 2hander; dual wielding and using an offhand gives a lot of passive threat to - regularly swapping your target can easily keep a pack of 5-8 mobs on you.
---
I saw someone else say it, but there was a good portion of my life I would only played Blizzard games and Counter-Strike. Blizzard would release a game and I’d know what I’d be doing with the next 5 years of my life.
---
Who levels as a paladin with a 1.7 speed sword? You'll want a very slow weapon either for big soc procs or big reckoning bombs.
---
You really don't want mobs to survive long enough that a full seal duration runs its course and if you do it like you propose judging sotc is even worse. In 30 seconds you get 12 SoR hits with a slow 1h or more likely around 8 with a 2h. You get 8-10 dmg per SoR hit, so that's roughly 80-100 bonus dmg over 30sec. The judgment at the end gets 40 bonus dmg, so you are sitting at 120-140 bonus dmg over 30 sec. If you had just judged SoR in the beginning, this would have dealt 90 dmg, so all in all over those 30 sec you got a whopping 1-1.5 dps increase. With SoC it's similar, jotc from lvl 32 adds 24 dmg per soc proc and you get 3.5 soc procs in 30 seconds, so that's 88 bonus dmg and the judgement gets 35 bonus dmg, so a total bonus of 122. Compared to 90 you would have done, an increase of 1 dps again.
---
The CDs are because my friend bought the game for me when I was broke. I returned the favour for him in TBC. The mouse mat was when last minute we went to Paris for the Blizzard invitational when some extra tickets came up and we had nothing else. Meaningful to me and not anyone else I guess
---
Yeah now to get the job, you need the experience.  
---
But to get the experience you need the job
---
To be considered a success, by Blizzard, a returning 500k players at launch, 200k after 1 year.
---
However, the real numbers will be at least 10 times bigger, 5 million+ at launch , with 2 mil+ after 1 year.
---
Which will make it a SLAM DUNK.
---
Were you not using the ilvl 200 Holy Light Libram available from launch through 100% of WotLK? Because if not you were not maximizing Holy Pally potential.
---
I'd be cool with limited server transfers...but the rest fuck that noise.
---
Chat channels of course would have to be removed aswell. Only /s and /y would work!
---
I think you'll find yourself in a lot of 1v1 brawls instead of ganks. Without that 'guaranteed' kill with CB, you're probably going to find it hard to take on 2v1 with your CC and anyone that overtiers you.
---
On the plus side, you'll do better in brawls that you would have engaged in if CB was on CD
---
Uh is that really the message you got from the wow episode ?
---
Dwarf holy priest will be an ideal healer for alliance.
---
Total war Three Kingdoms
---
This holds true for the heavy endgame PvE stuff. But if you want to explore through the different options while leveling, you can. You’re leveling for SO LONG in classic that you have that time to few out options for your class.
---
They don't scale "horribly", they just don't scale as well compared to other classes. I'd honestly have to say the same goes with Weapon damage outside of just Tier gear.   
---
Once Warriors and Rogues get their hands on the high end weapons from Naxx, they're absolutely terrifying. Before that, it's a pretty great race in both PvE and PvP!   
---
 It's hella fun. 
---
For Hunters... it never felt as terrifying, but obviously they were still stronger. For Hunters, Tier 1 is great, Tier 1.5 is meh(but has one important piece we need), T2.5 is near worthless for us, but Tier 3 is actually a great set albeit Tier 2 is nearly our end all be all. What disappoints me is we could have had actually useful set bonuses on the Tier 3 set - Personally I would have preferred they simply carried over the bonuses from set 2 but made them even better or proc more often. The stat differences between the two sets are a little... meh, but it's still better. I just wish Hunters got another 10% more agility between sets to compensate for the fact that we need the mots Agil by far to have any effect on our "power". Oh well! Either way the main tier sets are at least sexy af.
---
Don't worry too much about DPS in your raids either - Just do what you can and don't you dare miss your times to use utility skills like Tranq. Remember that any Rogue or Warrior that's stomping you in the charts, is likely under the effect of Crusader/Windfury/Hand of Justice/Sword Spec - All of which sadly Hunters don't really get to experience. Between those they can get seemingly a 30% DPS increase, which is amazing btw. Sadly none of our Bows have amazing proc abilities like those, nor do our ranged attacks. You're still important, fella.
---
Btw, the Rhok'delar quest and bow are pretty gd great. Seriously nothing feels as good as stomping those douchebag demons into the dirt. I had it for the longest time and absolutely mopped up enemies in AV, Duels, etc. The only time or person I remember actually flustering me was another Hunter in full Tier 2+, with the same build, that would nearly always stomp me(tactics were identical, gear-check essentially). Kudos to that person, but I also hate his purple NE ass. :D Anyways, being a Hunter is a blast. Be ready to lose, A LOT, considering how high the skill cap is for us with surprisingly as little skills as we actually use in pvp. There's a lot of management with Hunters.
---
One of the biggest advantages of a Druid off-tank is that they are extremely easy to gear. For the most part, the gear they're after is stuff no-one else wants, and much of the rest is found outside of raids. Having yet another Warrior on off-tank duty means having to spend that much longer finding more gear to go around. 
---
Plus, on fights where an off-tank isn't needed, or decursing is a priority, the Druid can shift to a support role and heal respectfully well with a 0/30/21 spec. Raids tend to have very few druids so they're probably going to have a set of healing gear in their backpacks relatively quickly. A Warrior off-tank can shift to DPS duty, but they're going to be limited by availability of gear, because they're competing with the hordes of other Warriors clamouring for the same gear.
---
Using GS had little to nothing to do with elitism though. It was just that it was a much easier and faster way to determine if people had adequate (by your own or the group/raid leaders measures) gear to clear the content.
---
I'm not sayin I'm a pro GS person, I hated it in wrath, but rest be assured, a GS wannabee addon is surely going to be a thing in classic as well, I'm almost certain. The question is if it's going to gain traction or not.
---
They do not want people to play classic, they can't sell mounts and pets or tokens in classic.
---
It needs to launch....
---
The world doesn't revolve around Twitch.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid
---
Good advice thank you. Also I need coffee cause I was reading SW:P as shadow word then  :P face lol
---
Tier 3. You could raid Kara in T3.  So no you’re not replacing your t3 with tbc greens.
---
Drank 11 and kill Kel thuzad.
---
a 240 is 30dollars, enough for Windows and WoW.
---
Thanks, hmm it's a tricky one to decide then. Better for BGs perhaps but worse for wPVP ganking. Perhaps it's something to try for the first few phases where I shouldn't be overtiered too badly.
---

---
HotW is the standard feral PvP spec, not really a great offtank spec at all.
---
If you're going to do druid tanking you should at least do it properly because you're representing a very stigmatized class and spec, you're not doing it any favors by playing a suboptimal spec.
---
it can be used, it really depends on your guild but having someone come every day and lose to a newbie on their 1st run would be infuriating. the DKP system was just a way to give credits to an active raider ...   
---
at one of my guilds in tbc (i think) we had a rotating raider list, so you were divided by loot type and class and would go in a specific order of getting loot. you had the option to pass on a piece of loot and still keep your rankings too
---
If that’s what you believe!
---
yuck, not for me... but it looks nice!
---
He’s being sarcastic.
---
It seems like they are still in the "You think you do but you don't" mindset
---
Is it going to be your main? Keep skinning until you've farmed your blue sinew from the dragonkin in winterspring. You will kill thousands of them.
---
DM tribute solo is mostly about vendor value, I thought, so ??? about value of enchanting. I never did it in Vanilla though. I used to do laps of the Undead troll areas in EPL, using feign death on top of veins in order to farm Arcane Crystals.
---
Dalaran?
---
I'm so confused by wife leaving you *then* becoming lesbian.
---
Both priest and mage are really solid choices. I think that, in raids, priests are more interesting because healing downranking provides some challenge compared to just spam the same spell over and over.

Tfw somebody says fantasy football but they mean fantasy handegg :(

I don't think you understand just how small and niche of a market classic is. This is targeting a less than 1 million player market, maybe a bit more or less. You need to understand that at the time of "Mohawk grenade" and other adverts, WoW was easily keeping a 5+mil sub base. They don't have that anymore, there is no point.
---
Find a guild that isn't a psychological dumpster fire.
---
Surprisingly little. The rank 10 gear is pretty sweet for locks iirc so if you're pping from the get go, you'll have no problems.

Well, to be fair she may have been a lesbian before that. She did love making out with her friends when she was drunk.  Which I fully supported.
---
Your title said fantasy football league. Most people will click it thinking you mean actual fantasy football not fantasy handegg. It's disappointing.
---
So read the whole thread?
---
These people will be the biggest flaw with Classic. I look forward to laughing in their face as non-meta does fine or the game does lol
---
You don’t “need to”. If your account gets hacked and your bank toon gets deleted, for example, blizz can restore it if it’s 10+ according to the poster below,
---
This has never happened to me but what is a little extra insurance worth to you?
---
Im a stickler for alliance, only because back in vanilla my half brother and I played alliance paladins from start to end, so I'm thinking of sticking the alliance route just for the memories. I have an absolute love for paladins in my heart, but I want to raid and do damage, and as we all know... Paladins are going to heal.  
---
I'm truly thinking of rolling a rogue, or a mage as my main character. What difficulty would I be looking into? Will I get to raid? Will I be a shit dps class? Will I be able to pvp? Whats the best way to make gold with these classes? Sell me into either class, classes I never played level 60 but only maybe 1-20.
---
But Josh..
---
Huh? That's not a belief just a fact haha. No faith required with that one, just science.
---
I do believe its their last straw
---
Damn, Brad McQuaid. Gonna have to listen to this when I get home.
---
Both are basically the BIS-class for their respective purpose.
---
But because of that there also will be a lot of others who want to do the same.
---
According to the big survey here 25% want to play heal and 61% want to play DPS, so it might actually be easier to get a DPS-spot this time around.
---
And yes, I tell you that because I wanna heal aswell! :D
---
\&gt;  Will you be playing, either primarily or occasionally, as an off-spec for your class?   
---
Shadow Priest here. Might heal some raids and will likely heal many 5-mans. Main-spec Shadow.  
---
\&gt; Do off-specs have a place in raiding?   
---
I believe they do.  
---
\&gt;  Do off-specs have a place in PVP, solo-leveling, or 5-man dungeons?   
---
Absolutely.  
---
\&gt;  Is Classic flexible in terms of whether or not off-specs can be successful?   
---
No where near as flexible as TBC and beyond but they still can be for sure.  
---
\&gt;  Do you have a favorite off-spec?   
---
Spriest.
---
\&gt;  Are people worrying too much about off-specs, and just need to mind their own/their guild's own business?   
---
Yes. However, I believe discussion on the subject is good. If it degrades into bickering, then the discussion is over.  
---
\&gt;  Please share your own thoughts, but feel free to use the above ideas as starting points of discussion 
---
The one argument I've read on this sub about Spriests vs the Holy/Disc "Shadow Weaving" priest is that the Holy/Disc priest is quite less effective when it comes to healing. Yes they can still heal decent and the Disc version isn't expected to be great at healing anyways. For progression however, the raid likely will need the healer slots to all be full healing, and not split for Shadow Weaving. Once the raid has geared up a bit more and the raid being attempted is closer to, or on Farm, then having a healer swap to Disc/Weaving is fine because not as much healing is needed. However, when the raid is on farm, then other Off Specs will want in.  
---
Basically having an Spriest over a Disc/Weaving or Holy/Weaving priest is better when the raid can't afford half a healer.
---
It's difficult to know what's going to be shit in the future for players. It certainly was so at the time. Flying felt cool. Arena seemed great. All those changes seemed to be what we wanted, but we didn't :-)
---
I do remember quite vividly though people hating on the shitty daily-quest routine that started in TBC, the catch-up item shit and - while people were okay with LFD, everyone I knew despised LFR and all the multiple difficulty levels they introduced so that every snowflake could experience the content while being afk.
---
To add to this, the tank is often a DPS warrior to begin with. He tanks so that he gets a group, but he's **definitely** not bringing competition with him for the DPS gear he's actually running the dungeon for in the first place.
---
!reminder 6 months
---
The gearing thing is a double-edged sword. Yeah, druids don't compete with others much for loot, but they also have a huge dry patch across MC and BWL where almost no feral druid gear exists. They start out strong because their pre-raid stuff is really good, but then they barely improve from there until AQ begins to offer some semblance of real itemization for the spec. Meanwhile, warriors will be picking up huge upgrades everywhere they go.
---
Retail is understandably their cash cow, Classic is for the players.
---
Most active players who enjoy Vanilla will have heard of this by now - for the players who aren't as active anymore, it will most likely come through word of mouth, etc. I don't know that they really want to go out of their way on an advertising campaign for something that probably isn't a big project in their future plans.
---
I think paid transfers didn't come until very late Vanilla or TBC.  And that they only opened transfers due to population to specific servers, but that could have been for free transfers.  I do recall that up until Wrath you could only transfer from PvP to PvP and PvE, but not from PvE to PvP.  Once you went down to carebear land, you couldn't come back to the righteous servers.
---
RP-PvP will be in the game at release because Blizzard isn't that stupid to leave them out after the feedback they've gotten.
---
It is very hard to get ele gear as a resto shaman until probably ZG where there are a few shaman sets. If you enjoy healing as a shaman then you'll always have a spot in raids, but the damage trinkets and jewelry will always go to the DPS. And you'll probably never get a spot as DPS unless you can prove to your guild that you can do it (it's very difficult).
---
Also, Tauren make fantastic shamans. You won't regret it. Their warstomp ability has plenty of value in PvP, so if that's what you want to play, they'd do great.
---
As far as a warlock, if you truly want to DPS, this is your class choice.
---
They focus on retail... We are minority... Or maybe not...
---
No it was, a lot of BIS items for classes were blues/purples from vanilla and early BC days and we're still incredibly useful throughout early Wotlk. 
---
Used to Be OT prot warrior avoidence build, had some great old shield/health trinkets that proced crazy blocks and health regen due to scaling before blizz patched it out.
---
https://youtu.be/MXPXF6Lh2vs
---
Video qualities crap, recorded it years ago, but the two trinkets used basically enabled me as a tank to fully regen all my health every two minutes as i would get X percentage health per block, I used tho two trinkets the first few times we cleared Naxx untill I had access to better ones.
---
Rank 1 fireball is one of the best ways to stop rogues from going into stealth. They've got plenty of utility.
---
Then ignore demand. Play either, I know an internet stranger's word is worth nothing, but I guarantee you'll have no drama, even being picky about the guild you want to join. Sign up for a countdown to classic guild if you're paranoid about getting a spot..
---
I've already pre-crafted them and written down the corresponding number for each attribute.

If you're going for a highly contested name this is the play.

---
I saw a couple of things on twitter.
---
Very minimal advertising, and probably hard for me to notice since I have adblocks on just about everything except my work computer.
---
What I saw on twitter was literally just a image of the WoW Classic image saying something like "Experience the world as it was 15 years ago" or some such. But yea, it definitely doesn't seem like they are going ham on advertising for it.
---
It happened over a year ago, I was there I remember noting down the timer with the boys, I don't have the discord announcement of it being removed since I was banned from the ELY discord back when it was hosted by shenna(they banned everyone who talked about their corruption).
---
I get the feeling just needing to micromanage all the stuff that goes in to a guild means you are inclined to micromanage drops.  I don't think its an issue if you have 40 hardcore raiders showing up every night with consumables because you'll clear stuff and drops are just a matter of time.  It seems like more of an issue with mid-tier guilds who have trouble filling out a raid and need to justify giving this piece to a guy over that guy.
---
Onslaught Girdle added in Phase 3? What?
---
Brief time for me is the two months between patch 1.4 and 1.5.
---
Now it's true that it happened before honor patch but it was less regular and, since I played on european server and the game was released just 2 months before, most players were mostly leveling (at least I was) and the truth is that it was mostly unplayable (server crashed, lag was terrible and fps was atrocious)
---
If you played beta and US server, 'brief' is maybe a bit too much but still doesn't change my main point that when BG was released and moreover when DK were implemented (so most of Vanilla life) World PvP became something rare that only happened from time to time.
---
I played this game for the first time just two weeks ago. Having played Vanilla for its entirety, I had fun concerning the lore perspective and setting. Other than that I feel like this is another example of an overall boring, unchallenging board game. The game depends a lot on item drops and dice rolls, so the ideal game for everyone who wants to play a casual game without too much thinking. 
---
Also it only comes with 4 classes of which only the warrior is melee. Other classes were available through addons. Quite the greedy move..
---
played troll (MALE!) mage through-out entire vanilla and can totally speak for Berserking saving my ass many times when popped &lt;30%HP, the cast-speed you get is insane and can definitely be a deal breaker in some fights.
---
If you compress cotton to a tight ball, it will hurt more. You only need to get it to the same volume while maintaining the mass.
---
Ever seen highly compressed round haystacks? It's just grass, but still every year people die by being crushed by them.
---
What other metrics are there for boss tanking than damage received, boss fight length (health and armour)?
---
I still have my +5 expertise trinket from the old blacksmith questline in vanilla.
---
Well I did last time I checked my storage for it lol. Miss that little hammer
---
Lol
---
A warrior in pre-raid BiS gets 76 stamina from his gear. 64 if he manages to get a Lionhearth. That's not much.
---
I'm not subbed, but I've been thinking about subbing on the 13th is it?
---
You can make and select names for your character in classic but not play them until the game launches. But still deciding.
---
What do you mean? It's simply a fact that a lot fewer items drop in Classic than in Retail. Tank gear is limited supply. No guild will be giving tank gear to someone who doesn't want to tank. And if you are receiving tank gear from your guild, but do not want to tank for your guild, you are deceiving your guild.
---
So in conclusion, all OP has to do if he doesn't want to tank for his guild, is let someone else get the tank gear. Problem solved.
---
Yea dude I loved this. Especially in the 40+ range when they found out I was holy/disc. Every group ended with “added you to my friends list”. Shit, actually questing became hard since I was always being asked to chain 5 mans
---
Yeah. It increases your range for everything,  basically.
---
Sure BWL gives them little in the way of upgrades, but the beauty of 0/30/21 is that for BWL you could just as easily switch into a healing role and prioritise that. Plus the Druid pre-raid BiS is so good due to the way the class works that you'll be fine through to AQ even with minimal upgrades. Warriors on the other hand are the most gear dependant class in the game, and whilst sure, they'll be getting some juicy upgrades along the way, competition will be fierce, and you're going to be looking at long dry periods for the Warriors too simply because of loads of people competing for the same loot.
---
Barrens, tanaris, darkshore, thousand needles
---
It is used man you gotta pick the right guild
---
I'm just curious, if I play ret palading, how easily can I solo farm for gold? That's the only worry I have.
---
Layering needs to be removed before phase 2, ideally even sooner.
---
Aw yeah keep going I'm getting close
---
What most important to you when playing this time around? Are you looking to top the charts or have fun along the away? Both? Everything?
---
Rogues- Rogues are a pain to level and cap, but have the benefit of being the best gankers in Vanilla. Players will forever have the noise of a rogue going stealth engrained in their brains for a reason. That being said, the most common leveling and raid spec for rogues (combat rogue) is very meh in PvP. Doable, but far from ideal. Combat is built for sustained damage, not the bust damage you see in PvP videos. Rogues are expensive to level because to stay relevant with damage you have to keep upgrading your weapons. Rogues are very gear dependent for damage. As far a gold farming, there are stealthed routes for farming dungeons that a lot of players use.
---
Raids, if you have pre-bis/bis mix you'll be close to topping the charts, only being out damaged by full BIS rogues In Phase 1. As other phases get released though you'll start falling off to Mages and Fury Warriors who will be topping to charts by far, however you'll still be doing very solid DPS. Slots will be harder to get the later the phases you're in, but there are always spots. Rogues are VERY gear dependent.
---
Mages. I have less to write on mages I never capped one. Super easy to level with AoE farming. Given that these areas will be camped for the foreseeable future this slows things down a little bit, but mages still have a very respectable standard leveling progression as well. Extra bonus is that you'll be leveling frost, which is also one of the best PvP setups, so not only do you get to deal great DPS while leveling, you get to destroy people in PvP while leveling. Gold farming is super easy whether it be with AoE Grinding in the open world, or farming Mara and other dungeons with AoE. You'll top the DPS charts throughout the entirety of Vanilla, falling off to Fury Warriors at the very end.  Mages are less gear dependent.
---
the fact that **the wait** is driving people into insanity is becoming more clear for each day
---
You had to start over. No PvE to PvP transfers were ever allowed in vanilla except for a handful of free transfers from very overpopulated PvE servers.
---
What science?
---
Ehh, I don't know about that. Lots of people (myself included) think if you want to have the best gear in the game you should have to raid.
---
Get Staff of Jordan either thru AH or world drop
---
If you're mostly playing by yourself I wouldn't go pvp healer in vanilla honestly. It's an extremely frustrating and unrewarding experience, I've seen few people who can stomach it long term.
---
You'll spend most of your time in CC. Noone in random BGs will dispel it, and you can't avoid it because almost none of the objects prevent line of sight. Your only outs are on 5 minute cooldowns. In vanilla CC is not capped in duration so it can take ages to break. As a paladin curse of tongues will also completely cripple you and it lasts 30 seconds, noone will dispel it.
---
But the worst part is how useless you feel when noone on your team is playing the objective. You can't just go off on your own and capture some bases, you have no CC and you can't kill anyone in a timely manner, if at all. A good dps player is gonna have a much larger impact on the game than a good healer when the rest of the team sucks.
---
Gearing up will be problematic, the pvp rewards are useless for a holy paladin. Personally I'd go with the spriest and play around with disc (which you can play fine with the pvp gear)
---
Off hand weapons have a higher base chance to miss, so to maximise damage you need more hit rating. 2h weapons use the same miss chance as a main hand weapon.
---
It all depends.. Wpvp as what? healer? spellcaster? melee dps?
---
HOTW build is for when you want to heal but also off tank dungeons fx. 
---
If you really want to off-tank properly in raids then its better to go full feral tree to get the Leader of the pack talent and then switch to cat dps (if your guild ofc allows it) when youre not needed for off-tanking.
---
If its like vanilla Silithus will only have elite bugs at launch.
---
Mods you have linked the outdated life at 60 thread. A updated life at 60 was posted by me. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c9trxf/a_updated_compilation_of_life_at_60_x_posts_from/
---
To be delayed
---
If they never changed the weapon skill -&gt; expertise in TBC then Edgemaster's Handguards would still be bis for a lot of melee.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
But seriously, Tanking with TF would be pretty boss.
---
Holding off. I was keen on subscribing early for name reservation but I decided against it because retail blows and I don’t feel like paying for nothing for 2 weeks.

*sees you browsing at a store, saunters over and leans into your ear, wet warm breath preceding the question:* "hey buddy can I have some of your magic water?"
---
yeah I wish I had come around to this realization back in vanilla. I played UD priest which I do love and devouring plague is so much fun but it is soooo much mana...  
---
Shadowguard provides damage to anything that hits you... unlike shaman's lightening shield which only works on physical attacks...
---
hex while it does no damage, just use rank 1 and you can spam that bad boy in group pvp for like 45 mana... its the heal reduction that makes this op. when healers pvp it is a battle of attrition anyway this gives u advantage
---
Resilience did nothing but force you to grind just to able to play the BG at all,
---
You don't think people are going to be squelched over disagreements in Barrens chat?
---
It’s just hard to find a GPU in the less than $350 price range tho, unless I buy used
---
That would make a lot of money and rage in equal part haha
---
 Barrens
---
Either of those will be fine choices for end game. Obviously there will be more frost mages than holy priests but don't let that deter you. As a priest while you level you will be treated to fairly regular whispers from groups needing a healer, especially in zones with tough or less popular dungeons. I think only priests and warriors get that special treatment while leveling, made me feel special anyway.
---
I personally have not had a problem. kohl's takes Amazon returns so it's even easier to return than ever.
---
Healing is all about maximizing your efficiency.
---
The most important thing here, that is not obvious is the 5-second-rule.
---
Which means you start regenerating mana at full speed once you haven't spent mana for 5 seconds.
---
That's why you don't constantly heal away every bit of damage someone has taken. Instead you wait until it is actually necessary and then heal everything at once.
---
You also use approprate ranks to avoid overhealing. In the meantime you can wand as a priest or melee as the others, if it is safe to do. Just don't spend mana on anything other than healing.
---
Often there's no need to heal a dps who has taken a bit of damage.
---
A bit of psychology is also involved. If you wait too long before you start healing the tank might panic and do something dangerous. So even if you have everything under control, I wouldn't let the tank drop below 30% health.
---
Healing strategy changes a bit later on with good gear and depending on class. Some specific encounters might also require you to heal small amounts of damage because otherwise people might become a oneshot to something.
---
But in general it's as I said: Stay out of the 5-second-rule for as long as you can and then heal everything at once without overhealing.
---
Win ME *throws up a little* God that os was trash. I've never had an is crash on me during installation.
---
That's the same as saying that Black Temple gear did nothing but force you to raid SSC/TK to participate...
---
Cold blood will be stronger the earlier on you use it. A 5 point  cold blooded eviscerate will blow people up as a fresh 60.
---
Don't say that on r/wow you'll get a lot of hate.
---
I have a desktop at my house. My friends like to come over and we have “LAN parties” like the old days. Everyone else has a laptop, and I’d rather him be able to come over and play than be stuck at his place.
---
Never said it was. Just saying that they did advertised their product, but in a different way and platform.
---
If I dont get classic I'm gonna snap
---
The hype is kind of dead. I think Beta did more harm than good.
---
For me it was sort of a case of I thought I did but I didn't.
---
Maybe other people feel the same.
---
Thank you dear
---
It’s integrated graphics, unfortunately.
---
Don't let that "the grass is greener" mentality get in the way of you choosing your class!  If you had to decide right now what class you would play, off the top of your head, that is probably the class you want to play.
---
could you please clarify what you mean? You’re asking if it’s possible to tank with the most powerful feral talent. 
---
Are you asking if it’s possible to offtank WITHOUT HotW? It is possible and a very very bad idea that your guild will not and should not support.
---
True, however, WoW by itself is still a very vertically scaling game.
---
If all gear that is used for PvP purposes - which can happen outside of arenas - can only come from raids, then there will be drama. 
---
It is in fact what happened on forums during late retail vanilla (2.0); how should "off-specs", or specs not optimal for raiding acquire gear? How should PvP players acquire gear for world PvP? etc.
---
Many smaller guilds in Chinese servers lost most healers in 2.0 to cross-server BGs, and mages and rogues had to spread misinformation on forums about how they still need T3 to heal Karazhan hoping to get them to raid Naxx.
---
That’s what I’m hoping. The guy has never played wow before so it’s tough to say if he’ll ever even make it to raid content where FPS would be crucial. I obviously want him to have a good experience though.
---
That would be acceptable.
---
I quit retail years ago, and moved to the Blizz-like pserver community. I signed the Nost petition, otherwise I"m probably invisible to them. I will be re-subbing to reserve my name, and possibly for the stress test if there is another one.
---
This is a silly exercise. You said what you enjoy most is leveling so why the charade? You know you are just going to rotate between leveling them all. Your real question is simply “which should I level first?” The answer is simple, it doesn’t matter. So assign each a number, grab a random number generator and let it pick for you.

Okay thanks, sounds good I found this spreadsheet for phase 1 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hPd7aGa_5dmGJBVnhX_FE84_c4LnoHL6UfzFqDyQSfg/htmlview#gid=1763911067
---
But that's the whole point: good officers know more than just their class. That's what makes them a good officer.
---
I ran a retail guild for 4 years. We were our servers #1 raiding group. My healing officer knew how every healer worked and had all of our CDs timed and lined up. There was no need for anything else and this was modern raiding mechanics (aka, harder)
---
Why are you going to need more people to run stuff that's not as hard? Simply having more players only makes organization a bit messier but the point still remains: why have 12 "leaders" when 5 can do the job? It cuts down on drama so much. Egos don't collide.
---
That's just like creating a guild with extra steps.
---
Have you considered you can solve this yourself? Don’t use the ah for anything and donate 20% of all your gold to needy players. Problem solved and you’ve put your money where your mouth is.
---
No, undead players use wotf as much as they have it, depending on how many priests, locks and warriors are on your team. So, the more alliance locks there are means more chances to fear an undead, plus death coil doesnt count as a fear. Bgs get hectic, they dont always have wotf up and your fear isnt on a long cd anyway.
---
I am debating between gnome lock/human mage or human lock/gnome mage. I dont want 2 gnomes or 2 humans so its going to be one of those combos, but im not sure which one is the better combo. The one thing that is swaying me is that warlocks get a horse mount, and gnomes look rediculous on a horse mount with those tiny legs. Any ideas to push me one way or the other?
---
If they have no TV and no monitor then it's highly unlikely they're interested in video games in the first place.
---
bullshit. I'm a normal person that works and I watch streams. there's a bunch of us in my company. not many but we exist. why do you somehow assume everyone that watches twitch is either a kid, unemployed or still in school?
---
Make your own Soccer league if you like. Make sure to have faking injuries and getting away with it get you bonus points.
---
they aren't immune to CC completely like the mobs are. Will of the forsaken clears fear charm and sleep and then provides immunity for 5 seconds so there are other things you can do.  You can slow and kite during those 5 seconds then recast fear because wotf has a 2 minute cooldown and a lot of undead rogues dont carry a pvp trinket because they do the exact same thing.  If you catch a rogue with some distance then you can burn them pretty quick and since they dont have cloak of shadows they cant clear your dots to vanish.
---
I don't understand why the spreadsheet values crit% at zero. Surely, it's not completely useless?
---
*Calculations*  
---
Healing Equivalent Point (HEP) weights for Spi, Int, Mp5, Healing  
---
Freewind Gloves, 19 Spi, 15.7225 HEP --&gt; weight for spirit = 15.7225 / 19 = 0.8275  
---
Cindercloth Pants, 12 Int, 13.9284 HEP --&gt; weight for intellect = 13.9284 / 12 = 1.1607  
---
Archivist Cape, 4 Mp5, 14 HEP --&gt; weight for Mp5 = 14 / 4 = 3.5  
---
Omnicast Boots, 14 Healing, 14 --&gt; weight for Healing = 14 / 14 = 1  
---
Using weight for Spi to calculate weight for Stam  
---
Kris of Orgrimmar, 1 Stam, 1 Spi, 0.8275 HEP --&gt; Weight for Stam = 0.8275 - 1*0,8275 = 0  
---
Using weights to calculate weight for crit%  
---
Dragonslayer's Signet, 12 Stam, 12 Int, 6 Spi, 1 Crit%, 18.8934 HEP --&gt; weight for crit% = 18.8934 - (12 * 0 + 12 * 1.1602 + 6 * 0.8275) = 18.8934 - 18.8934 = 0
---
*Note*  
---
From patch 1.6 to patch 1.10, spirit is weighed at 1.1775 because of the T2 3-set bonus.
---
We know that BFA is canon but we still want to play classic ;)
---
The downsides are not taking Ruthlessness or Relentless strikes.
---
To fully answer the question - you've traded a guranteed crit ability for one which improves your fights versus melee classes (Riposte), yet with a hemo build, fights against melee classes should be your easiest matchups. You should be able to 100-0 other rogues, and control warriors with ease. 
---
I personally found the functionality of a evis crit when I needed it too useful to give up.
---
&gt; Don´t you know that people never change opinions
---
And here you are, trying to make someone change his opinion on someone's changed opinion :D
---
Bro players vs active subs is a whole different thing. If anything hes lowballing. I heard across wows 15 yrs its had 100 mil unique players
---
On eu, if you follow the argent dawn community you will end up on classic rppvp, that is really the only rp community left and a few of them like pvp.
---
On my discord most people have given it up.
---
Shedo has specifically stated that agility is preferred stat, full stop.  I trust his theory crafting .
---
yeah I think companies are slowly learning this but it's baffling why blizzard are lagging behind so much. it's also super apparent in the way they handle wow as an esport. they push the arena and m+ tournaments that barely anyone watches while refusing to push the world's first race in any way, although it gets crazy numbers
---
All of the starting zones
---
There’s one in Ratchet too if I remember correctly
---
Its usually impractical on a resto shaman, because 2/7 gcds and roughly 500 nana per 10 secs.   You can't really effectively heal while doing that.   It adds roughly 3% dps to your melee.  The shaman could probably do more than that dps'inf himself.  Its mostly just epeen Bullshit.
---
However, in some instances healing is light enough such that the healers don't all need to heal.  You can employ this technique in those instances.
---
Onyxia phase 3 is a good example of this.  Healing is very light, so as a shaman you can twist and/or dps some.   I used to AA the boss and drop searing totem.  I didn't twist or dps, because I figured it was better to be safe than sorry.  Later on I got a good 2h, and I would switch to that.
---
That's a good one, thanks!
---
I think you should just find a sandbox MMO to play instead dude if this is the kind of feature you're looking for.
---
Yeah, leeway *is* idiotic. At the very least, it should be tuned down a lot to take into account how much better connectivity we have today compared to back in vanilla.
---
The trap thing is also extremely idiotic if you ask me, but it is hard to argue against. Technically, they are just sticking to the 1.12 patch here, but I think it is lazy to just use that excuse. Honestly, it makes no sense. I don't see the problem in Blizzard admitting it was probably not intended in 1.12 and pick how it was for almost all of vanilla.
---
I guess the big problem is other people then want things for their class that also existed in prior patches, so I think we just have to accept the trap DR.
---
Can I use my s10+ to play it though?
---
Literally the only ACTUAL point of "Class Leaders", is for epeen and ego. It servers literally no purpose. It's a joke of a role. If XLegolasX is so important to the guild, promote him to fucking officer/loot council and call it day. The fuck is a "Hunter Leader" going to do? Other than sit on his pedestal?
---
It's more than one slot not shared. When I compare my endgame AP ret bis to an endgame fury bis it shares two-three items (bracers and gauntlets + cloak or belt)
---
Check out his #1 video where is still low level and killing skull level players, this guy is really good
---
Picked up Kingdom Come: Deliverance from this months humble bundle. Really beautiful game with a ton of depth. Definitely not for everyone, but if you’re into the non-fantasy medieval setting, it’s an awesome time sink.
---
hope you like pressing frostbolt!
---
I love the prospect of taking forever to hit 60.
---
my only fear... 
---
Will raids be abandoned as new ones open? Or will people still do "old" content
---
As an Off Tank 0/30/21 is perfectly fine.  The thing about a good druid off tank is versatility though, so you will tank one boss, heal the next, heal some trash, help tank the next set.  
---
Druids are a hybrid and need to be played as a hybrid to be optimal.  
---
Leader of the Pack is not critical for a druids threat generation, it helps but its not critical.
---
This just looks nauseating.
---
I would return it for a 21:9 monitor.
---
They very much didn't lose their lives the moment they started playing. Cartman wanted to fight the big baddie, he tried to recruit but only the boys joined and that's when they chose to give up their lives.
---
"Turn off growl"
---
It is off, I activated it manually once because that mob was chewing up our priest. But thanks for your valuable advice!
---
If you want to dedicate yourself to bgs and occasional runs, roll pally and find a real pvp guild. You are indispensable in alliance premades, and some of the problems that come from running with randoms disappear in premades. Shadow priest is strong but you are extremely thirsty in bgs, not nearly as useful as a paladin healer. Popping in and out of shadow to heal is not really an option.
---
One of the things I liked doing most in WoW was playing Arathi-Basin.
---
Tricking opponents into believing they have a numerical advantage or equity when this is not the case, is just super usefull in this BG!
---
And ontop of that Elfs just look way better!
---
Berserking and Shadowguard are good for PvP but you're shortchanging Troll Priests by not mentioning Hex of Weakness - that spell is criminally underutilized in PvP. If there is any chance that your opponent may heal throw rank 1 on him/them to give healing debuff, if they are a ret pally or a dual wielding class cast max rank to efficiently and significantly reduce their dmg output, rank 1 eats a shammy's grounding totem in a duel, etc.
---
Stranglethorn actual being a *highly* dangerous jungle environment instead of just some trail you randomly blaze through while leveling an alt is going to be pretty cool.
---
I totally forgot about this till i started messing about on pservers this week! so annoying
---
Not much...
---
If they would be the same Blizzard as they were back then, yes because they would "monetize" it by realizing where things went wrong with the expansions and go on with new expansions for classic - done right this time.
---
Engi is always great in PvP.
---
You have a lot of great instance farming, so you could double craft if you really wanted to.
---
Engineering let's you craft ammunition, most of which is stronger than you can buy for quite some time. If you are trying to min max your dps then engineering is important. Additionally, it gives you a lot of utility for PvP and some raids.
---
10000% more important now with hunters being more scuffed than we thought regarding leeway + DR on our CC + pets being unresponsive.
---
I think it was very much a passion project for them to create the first one, so if they aren't excited for the actual Classic themselves, I doubt the episode will even be considered. It wasn't because it became a fad and they wanted to cash in.
---
It could have a great tie-in to all the stuff about JJ Abrams and the memberberries though, IIRC that storyline was never concluded.
---
If you dont/wont play in premades this advice is spot on.
---
He also gets endurance and imp kick.
---
Not even just the gaming industry but software in general. Or really any business, it's like getting pissed at the drywaller for the design of the house
---
Bye
---
^^ This.  Interrupting your journey because some douche wants to gank and camp your corpse.
---
Thanks for the detailed response!
---
1% crit isn't even 1% dps gain, and its not up 100% of the time, so its not wrong.
---
That's incredibly uncreative.
---
I'll be Legololz69
---
For what it's worth, I've been playing since release, and subbed for about 80% if that time. I had resubbed two months before the beta and ended up getting an invite.
---
What an astounding lack of perspective that lies behind a post like this.
---
Class Leaders are fucking cringy. The only purpose they serve is to give someone epeen and to make them feel important. They're completely useless lol. And I've been playing WoW since Vanilla, and been on the pserver scene since Nost so I'm not just some "retailer". I probably have way more Vanilla experience you. And I can tell you for certain that nobody except super, *super* casual guilds living in 2005, and super, *super* micromanaged guilds trying WAY too hard, are going to use "Class Leaders". 
---
I haven't heard one good reason why they should even be a thing. 
---
&gt;In Classic, many guilds launch with 200+ people just because you will have many people not hitting 60, not raiding or doing these things lately and you still need the 40 men for the raids. You have 20 man raids with less days of lockout, pvp events, class specific quests and farming, helping low levels, discussion on specs to maximize raid dps etc etc. 
---
Cool. The same shit applies to psvers and nobody on pservers have "Class Leaders". 
---
You really think 6 good officers including GM can't handle 200 guildies? What kind of ship are you guys even fucking running lol.
---
Skinning for leveling. At 60 drop it and get engineering + 1 profession to make money. Enchanting wouldn't be my first choice but it might help a bit if soloing dungs and getting the lower value vendor items.
---
Pantheon looks like dogshit. I don't understand how people get sucked up into these games. Actually, it legit looks like a clone of some of the failed MMOs that followed classic WoW. I guess in that sense we're truly reliving the past.
---
Us old farts are still around you know ;)
---
Been playing mainly DotA, HON and Dota 2 since mid-wotlk.
---
Ask Jeeves
---
That's because it's not true
---
that's just not true tho. I don't think store mounts will be available but not sure about the pets. the gold token will 100% not be available in classic purely because of the difference in classic and retail's economy. 240k gold in retail is probably equivalent to 240g in classic.
---
Beta.
---
Your the exception then, not the norm.  421 prot / ret paladin here.  It takes me days to get a mythic+ group (since my guild is dead).  It’s easier to get a full H eternal palace clear in a pug than it is to get in any higher key group.
---
Nothing in Vanilla aside from leveling was actually hard lol.
---
This happened on ALL realms in Vanilla.
---
It will happen in Classic as well...and guess what? IT IS A GOOD THING !
---
You have the, let's say, top 3 guilds on your faction. They are progressing through AQ40. The are MELTING MC in 1 hour. They need NOTHING from MC, but they need as much gold as possible to sustain their raiders in AQ40 and, down the road, Naxx.
---
Than you have 3-5 guilds that are in BWL, preparing for AQ40. They aren't that hardcore, like the top 3 guilds, but they aren't pushovers.
---
And than you have the 30+ guilds that are STILL in MC. They want to progress, but they simply can't go past a certain boss, because the best players on their faction are in the top 3 guilds or the mid-top 3-5 guilds. There are only so many good players on a realm.
---
And than you have HUNDREDS of players that don't have the time to raid at specific hours/day, but they do have time to farm gold.
---
Selling MC loot (and later on BWL loot, albeit in a much lower proportion) helps the not-that-good guilds having some of their members access loot that they can't, which in turn, help the next raids see progress, giving them access to loot that haven't had access before.
---
A Vanilla realm is a COMMUNITY. The top dogs don't care about MC loot, but they care about gold. The smaller dogs care about MC loot, because they need it if they want to go past MC. If they can't go past MC while NOT having access to buy MC loot from the better guilds...they will STOP raiding. And soon, lots of their players stop PLAYING the game.
---
People have this strange idea that MC is going to be a walk in the park...it will be, for the first 10, maybe 12 guilds on the faction on a realm, but for the rest of the guilds (which are easily, EASILY more than 30 on a given realm) MC is going to be really hard.
---
And BWL, which is where the phat lewt is , is going to be IMPOSSIBLE for most guilds, except the top 10-12, ona  faction, on a given realm.
---
The reason is simple : there is a SMALL and FINITE numbers of good players, and they will ALL gravitate toward the top guilds, leaving ALL the other guilds in the dust.
---
Are player today much better than 15 years ago? Relatively, yes. Are the bad players better today? Absolutely no. A bad player might be slightly better, but the good players of old will be so much better, it won't even matter.
---
Most players will NOT be better enough to go past MC.
---
But most players will WANT shiny loot, and if gold is the easiest way to get it (because it IS the easiest way). selling MC loot will be prevalent. Selling BWL loot will also exist, but in smaller quantity.
---
Which, again, is a GOOD THING, especially because IT KEEPS PEOPLE IN THE GAME, people that would have quit otherwise.
---
Going to name my hunter, Ineedthat
---
Are you me? Nobody wants caster mail except shamans so their isn’t much competition. You won’t really be rolling on cloth dps gear for pvp since mail has a ton more armor. Hardest items to get would be neck, back, and rings since they aren’t class specific. Trinkets won’t be to bad. Got pvp, engineering, misc ones, plus a class trinket in BWL that increases dmg by 20%. You’ll be able to gear up and do some sweet burst. However shaman is a support class first and foremost. Your priority will be saving people &gt; killing. 
---
As for race go whatever you like best. Trinket cleanses stuns. So what’s the need for hardiness? Warstomp allows for clutch plays. Stamina boost is nice. Plus taurens fit the class so well. They are big and clunky tho. However your ele so those gnomes can suck on your big nutz as you Crit them for 3k
---
Luck of the draw I think. Most people I talked to on the beta when it first started had played since vanillia, but I'm sure there are more long term subscribers than there were beta spots.
---
Preferred for what?
---
On the flip side, we don't want some dude who was a huge fan of vanilla but has since stopped playing MMOs in the timespan since to be unaware it is relaunching just because he's no longer in the loop.
---
It’s perfectly fine. Like I said just keep settings low and you’ll get 60fps and probably 40fps in cities and 30fps in raids. The laptop might get toasty at times so be aware of that.
---
Then why not level with skinning and herb or mining? Why wait until 60 to level one?
---
Respec for PvP sounds horrible. I'd go with whatever is more fun. You have experience as a hunter so you won't be a huntard, I'd so go for it if you like it.
---
They have never let me down since I purchased Warcraft 2. And I don't follow meme-trends online that people scream about for no reason at all. I already have a family and a home where I belong, don't need to belong with online zombies! _:)
---
Because 13€ is so much for us old farts comimg back after 13 years 😂
---
I haven't been subscribed since 2011.
---
Hex is massively underrated imo.
---
If you play a tri-spec priest in a pvp premade, you can spam it all over the place and not only will you get a good chance of getting blackout procs for little mana, but you will also cover your warlock's curse of tongues for the enemy mages (and druids, but they rarely participate in the group fights in AB/WSG) to decurse.
---
Ty anyway.
---
Your comment will be considered when i make the final choice.
---
There is such a persecution complex in this sub it's ridiculous
---
Just my thought, why would they add them in the beta?
---
Giving up cold blood, 2% flat damage from murder, and 30% crit damage from lethality in exchange for a slightly better sprint, parry, and evasion sounds pretty terrible.
---
Same. Not only have I only been a monk since their release, but only a windwalker monk at that.
---
God damn I hate the disrespectfully disproportionate amount of credit Nostalrius gets for Classic happening. Their server was built on 10+ years of people laboring and other people supporting the effort to create a somewhat realistically Blizzlike server but Nostalrius takes the baton the last handful meters across the finish line and they get sole credit.
---
It's a great video though, even if I think the private server chapter should've featured more than just Nost. Very well put together and extremely well-chosen soundtrack!
---
Anathema
---
Very torn between priest or mage. While I plan to do a good amount of raiding and BGs until I get the gear I want, main focus will be world pvp with my gf who is a very good feral Druid, so really I want what would be a better duo for that. Note that as a priest I would have to be a night elf as they are my favorite (as a mage I’d be a gnome) and I would want to raid as holy and go shadow or disc for pvp. Thanks!
---
ESO comes closest.
---
Once again. Just in time to take up half my day at work.
---
Really enjoyed the madseason talk.
---
To play on a RP-PvP server without phasing.
---
NO. CHANGES. PLEASE.
---
Btw, You could also pickup skinning and mining and mail all materials to a bankalt. Then when you have enough leather remove skinning and get leatherworking 1-300 and do the same with mining and engineering. A alt with mining and skinning would be good to have unless you want to buy all materials after your stockpiles run dry, depending on how well you are doing on gold.
---
i agree with everything you said except raiding isn't the beginning of the game, it's that mindset that pushed blizzard in focusing so heavy on raids and not on other content like they journey to get there or alternative end game paths like professions
---
The people that will actually play the game dont watch twitch. twitch is for kids.
---
That's fine, I want to play classic, but I enjoyed what TBC had to offer a million times more. If they did rerelease it I'd jump over in a heartbeat.
---
Huh? Cat dps was fine in PvP with HOTW spec. It’s by no means “terrible”.
---
How so?
---
Yeah that happened to me last night got a Titan forge wq 440 completely replaced what I had.
---
Sounds like like they got similar cons. Would you prefer range or melee? 
---
I also read T1 gear for hunter is really good. So even if you only ever raid MC you’ll be decked out with some great multishot damage.
---
I was thinking of doing something like that. Your plan sounds pretty good might actually do that.
---
Great gear for pvp (aside from HW/GM) should be earned from ranks 10+. As someone who gets mad level and only enjoys the pvp aspect of end game I am still of the firm belief that if you want to optimize you should still have to raid/dungeon delve. By limiting pvp viability to only pvping you lock out way to many people from wanting to pvp
---
I can't agree more. I think it's downright embarassing that Jay hasn't in any way alluded to the fact that he realizes that was a pretty condescending statement to make in front of a crowd of their most loyal fanbase.
---
There are going to be players that put the time into figuring out what's BiS for classes. It's not unlikely for that to spin into a gear-scoring system to factor in all relevant items and determine how many of those items a player has.
---
Min/Max has been in WoW since Vanilla, it was just never as prevalent as it is in Retail because the game was newer and information was more limited. The average skill-level in WoW has grown tremendously since then, so the percentage of players who are capable of participating end-game content will be higher than the mid-2000s.
---
I was lucky to get 1 fps on the laptop that I first played on.
---
Getting the new rig was akin to me playing blind since BC. View distance, not lagging out going into Dalaran during busy hours.
---
It’s not it’ll just be GEARSCORE not iLevel.  Vanilla is balanced like garbage so a custom system will be more accurate.
---
There are lots of rewards to tanking or healing, you can more easily find groups. Yet there is a lack of tanks and healers and especially with Warriors, there are many warriors that just want to DPS. DPS classes don't have to be as engaged all the time in content their groups won't wipe if they are mediocre. 
---
I am not talking about the best DPS players or very dedicated ones I am talking about the population at 60. Also, in my comments, I very clearly did not remember shadow priest popularity or other elements as I haven't played WoW for years. I am mostly just remembering that it was much harder for me to find a group as a DPS Warrior compared to a tank. When I went tank I was almost immediately able to gear up even my pre-raid DPS stuff and get into a guild. My point was that my willingness to respec allowed me to actually do more group dpsing as a warrior within my guild rather than if I had simply always DPSed. I don't know what it is like to play a Hunter or a Mage.
---
This xD
---
Guilds are usually understanding when it comes to fire mages and don't ask them to respec for MC, Ony and BWL. It doesn't take very long to clear those raids once you have AQ/Naxx gear anyway so it's kinda silly to ask someone to potentially spend 100g/week on a couple of raids that are done in a few hours.
---
This is the most helpful bit of info I hadn't considered. The initial cast of bite + claw when the pet hits initially seems to make it worth having both on auto-cast and learned while leveling. Once prowl comes into play I guess it'd not affect much by removing bite from your bar.
---
I found a 2 in 1 laptop that is an open box at my local computer retailer for $240.  Intel I3 8000 series processor + UHD 620 graphics.  Going to work as a tablet and then an on the go WoW: Classic box for me.
---
Anyone know if bear form has a larger hitbox as well? I’m guessing that cat would be standard (maybe smaller?)
---
see ya
---
People like playing hot people not necessarily humans but it does cover it.
---
Reminder to watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeN-CzudUgU
---
I’d go with mage for your goals. Simply because of the respeccing with the priest.
---
“Some guys” and one of them was called Shroud, king of brs
---
Mining and herbing are a pain to level while leveling yourself. Not enough nodes/herbs spawn to keep up with the zones your leveling in.
---
Yes, it also shares 0-1 items (possibly cloak) with rogue phase 6 bis. 
---
It shares 2-4 items with casters and 2-3 items with fury warriors, the rest is stuff nobody else needs.
---
Especially the delivery of the initial no. Like he's just fucking tired of this stupid question with an obvious answer. I think it makes anyone with a little bit of customer service experience cringe when they realize it's said infront of a gathering of their most devoted fans. At least mince your words a bit more carefully, lol.
---
I don't think you do lmfao
---
Played vanilla as a resto shaman first time around and want to play something completely different.   I would love to tank but seeing how my time to raid will be limited should I even bother?  Will there be any need for a part time off tank raider or should I just stick with a dps class and try to raid when I can ?
---
I played on EU server too. Those battles were happening, even when leveling. There were also battles in Menethil Harbour and other towns, effectively killed with DKs as you mention (atrocious idea, especially as it could be totally accidental and by a raid member, not even yourself).  
---
But for the record, those battles happened in US beta, EU beta, open betas and for a few months after release. They were there, but BGs will probably kill it again sadly.
---
Gnome mage w/ engineering 💯
---
I loved the pservers and will be playing classic when it releases, but people gotta remember this. Nost, Ely, all of it, was completely free. Classic players don’t care much about retail, so classic to them is $15 a month. There will be people that don’t want to sub, and there will be a small population that still will play pservers because of this. But if enough people sub to Classic, that will hopefully change. All I’m saying is that the sub generates a paywall that some will not get over.
---
There is, but the closest FP to BB is back in Darkshire.
---
The Plaguelands.  All the Scourge lore, the mass amounts of undead everywhere, having to avoid roving bands of Scarlet Crusaders, Tirion's quests, and the epic Battle of Darrowshire.  Those were some good zones.
---
Barrens, Shimmering Flats
---
You could buy the engineering crafted ammo on the AH, but most of the other engineering stuff requires you to have that profession to use it.
---
Usually who plays fortnite are 9 yo, so that says more about you then me lmao.
---
I'll make mine a few days before August 13 to grab the allowed 3 names...
---
It shouldn't, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't lay out the rules.  More so, with everybody knowing every piece of content, when it will be available, when BiS upgrades are, you should be setting up priority lists pretty easy.
---
Don't give a BiS Striker's Mark bow to hunters that will replace it in phase 2 (they can take a blastershot or that engineering gun).  But I'd even say that in phase 2 every melee will get Satyr's bow as an interum stat stick, so it's debatable... but I still say minimize the upgrades for everybody.  The content isn't going to be difficult by any means for the first 4 phases of content.
---
Wont I have to respec just as mush as mage to get to arcane power/winters chill for pve and then switch back for pvp?
---
Not to mention a level 30~ mace is included in your rotation 😂
---
I really hope not. Unless they make a full CGI movie similar to the cinematics. Id be down for that.
---
If we are talking about mobile games... sure, let the closed eye guys have all of them because I dont give a fck abojt that shit full of microtransactions and shitty mechanics
---
It doesn't damage them at all if people switch to classic, they're still getting sub money. The $60 for an xpac is pocket change to them in comparison to the sub income.
---
Viability isn't locked out. You're just less powerful.
---
In vanilla it made sense, since the PvP gear was very usable in PvE too. PvP gear in TBC was terrible for raiding.
---
Alternatively, convert all the resilience to a more class-appropriate stat (like crit?) in BGs and let all the casuals roll around in them, and keep it in Arenas so there's so 'hardcore' content.
---
Same reason that you couldn't just jump in and be relevant in a BT/Naxx raid, you shouldn't just jump into PvP in greens and expect Gladiator.
---
Really? Isn't that canon? Lol
---
As nice as cc prevention is, every class also has access to FAPs and LAPs. I think the value of cc preventing racials that are good against a few classes are overstated compared to dps racial that are good against all classes.
---
I'm not subbed and cant imagine I will sub until Classic launches, or perhaps the day before.  My IGN in pretty unique and never had an issue getting it in any game.
---
As a hunter, I love sending my broken tooth to say hi💕
---
I love Madseason, so many YouTubers make really clickbaity, gimmicky content these days, it’s nice to see one who presents their stuff in a barebones, straightforward manner.
---
I like the idea of making dungeons harder but I don't like the gamey feeling that dungeon/raid difficulties have
---
I leveled mining + engineering with a hunter on a pserver recently to character level 45, it wasn't that bad.
---
King bangalash. Not sure if he counts as a tiger though
---
you have to see the TBC dungeons like SM,DM,RFK/RFD,ect... One big instance separated in 3 parts.
---
lmao, what a sperg. Also you play fortnite, cant take you serious.
---
Maybe i can make some armor at 60 and drop lw unless i get my hands on the armor kits.
---
Make a friend.
---
Well what did you expect. wotlk was the worst expansion and the mark of decline in quality content in wow. they don't call those players wrathbabies for nothing.
---
The mtx and xpac cost are just icing on the cake, which is the subscription fee.
---
Go home, old man
---
When I found out they were going to release classic I got goosebumps and a huge smile on my face.  I wish they would at least try to spread that feeling to others.
---
Yeah when he was 19 he passed in his sleep from an undiagnosed heart condition. Healthy as an ox, star athlete, then he was just gone. Just appreciate the ones you love every day. Life is fragile and unpredictable.
---
You can... but most who are pugging won't just take a random Ret Pally or Balance Druid.
---
100% there will be a 'Classic' token to counter the gold sellers and to make revenue off Classic
---
You know what I mean :P
---
STV is like 2 or 3 zones in length...
---
You also will have a pitiful amount of spirit low level with no gear, so it barely helps.
---
riveting gameplay ....
---
Ty for the reply man.
---
I really enjoyed TBC as well, despite its flaws. Ideally i'd like to see two variations of classic beyond modern wow, a classic time capsule server, and a classic+ server set that follows the idea that one vanilla dev suggested, where they re-create and redesign TBC using its assets, but designed around staying true to the core vanilla design pillars (so no flying/dailies, stuff like that). 
---
I'd also like to see them do classic+ with horizontal progression, so that TBC content doesnt just invalidate everything from classic.
---
But therein lies the issue, in base game someone in pvp epics was viable in raids, just slightly suboptimal and hardcore raiding guilds wouldn't let you in the door without a reputation behind your name. Same story the other way around. Once tbc hit if you didn't have pvp epics good luck in pvp at all, same with pve
---
I'm so glad achievements are gone. Requiring people to have done content before joining a group to do the same content has always baffled me.
---
They have like 15 years of subscription data, I think they have at least an idea.
---
Sadly people will do shit like that, just my opinion ,,,,,,
---
Most (if not all) the thorium dungeons and raids will be in the game on release (can't remember if thorium has quests for BWL, obviously if they do my opening statement is false) 
---
BRD, BRS, MC all will be in the game phase 1 , so it makes sense their corresponding quests will be available asap
---
TBC HYPE!!!
---
because the marketing reach of nerds behind cameras is other nerds. but obviously they don't care about throwing a wider net so your point remains valid
---
I mean the rare ones from mc. I heard they are pretty expensive.
---
Disenchanting was my money maker in 2006.   
---
Farming mobs, DE greens and Blues. Sell them.
---
This guy is so cringe. Especially when retweeting Donald trump in between his hate tirades on blizzard on Twitter.
---
And I am giving Blizz my gratitude and money. You will not be missed.
---
And also that the same leeway mechanics were in the private servers....
---
You need to think "what where the primary reasons wow was so popular back then?" If most people where completely content zero major changes would of been made to WoW 
---
2019's circumstances are much different than 2004's
---
I'm so sad about this, cenarion circle rep grinding is an actual Cyunt and wanted to kill two peens with one peen but RIP my CC exalted preAQ dreams
---
I'm feeling your pain here. I don't have anything meaningful to contribute but I bet others would if they'd read your post in full.
---
I was so unlocky to get a concussion before my vacation started..
---
This show has been keeping me sane... 
---
Miss the lore episodes though!
---
Enchanting will only make you money if you have some rare recipe not many other enchanters have.

&gt; Vanilla is so much better then retail, like it's not even comparable and people will enjoy the game so much more, I'm pretty convinced vanilla will overtake retail in playerbase eventually.
---
While I agree, there are a few components, namely tank class diversity, which Vanilla could benefit from improvements in. Do you consider yourself a purist, or do you think classic could benefit from some of the improvements implemented by BC and Wrath for tank pallys/druids? Not necessarilly releasing those expacs, mind you, but at least enabling some class diversity in the role.
---
The server I'm on to have a consistent 2-3k players would be ideal.
---
Sweet, I'd love to hear your farming locations that will consistently make 50g/hour at launch
---
I agree on this one.  Flying is ok for me, I think it adds something cool to areas and it's a nice reward for high level players.  But, dungeon stones shouldn't port anyone at all to the dungeon.
---
80 energy if you time it properly, 60 if you dont.  40 from furor, 20 from helm, 20 from energy tick.
---
&gt;With the lying you're saying they got lazy in TBC? It had more content in every way than vanilla, in a faster pase and most of it was extremely good.
---
Was not aimed at you in particular 1 I mean I’m sitting happy with 3x 27” 1080p monitors (one 144hz) but more in general, first it was 21” then 24/27” then it’s 1440p it’s just fun to watch the sweet spots move :-)
---
You think they do, but they don't.
---
You assume that because someone picks druid and goes feral that they will know they have to farm multiple Crowd Pummeler's, every week until AQ40, to be viable?
---
That's a lot of faith to put in a rando my friend
---
Neutral cities are ok if they're small, think Gadgetzan, Booty Bay, Everlook, Ratchet.  They're horrible when it becomes your main hub a disconnected world.
---
I think they are redoing all the animations and current stuff isn’t representative of final progress but I agree combat looks slow and lacks feedback.
---
&gt;...what exactly will Blizzard do?
---
Enjoy the money.
---
&gt;Medieval trope "orcs vs humans" but in spaaaaaaace... Nah that was stupid AF too.
---
So you just straight up think that warcraft lore is garbage, then? Because "spaaaaaace" as you put it is an integral part of the lore and it's always been there. "Space monsters" are the reason why Azeroth is split in two. They're the reason why nagas exist. They're the reason why night elves refuse to use arcane magic. They're the reason why the Scourge exists. 
---
Do you even like this game?
---
Do you know if there are any mods that can be preintalled and setup for classic or will we have to wait post launch for that?
---
I did not like that they introduced different difficulties in raiding, TBC had it better. It was hard as fuck, but when next raid was released they tuned down the old content a bit. Was a working system.
---
I think people make too big a deal of wotf, I actually think it's quite underwhelming especially compared to fear ward (30 second cool down, can Cast on others, prevents fear altogether instead of allows you to escape )
---
If I play horde (unlikely, but if I find the right guild) I'll be rolling a troll 1. Because everyone plays UD 2. It's way fuckin funny to be a female troll bahaha
---
above every other!
---
I love this. People quote him like you don't already know thats the ENTIRETY of their knowledge of him. 
---
"HE'S THE GUY WHO SAID THIS ONE THING WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE THINKS HES A DICK!"
---
Thanks everyone, but we know this. Do people not see the cycle here?
---
ZG bud.
---
I remember listening to this song in the shower back in 2007, right after smoking pot for like the second time. 
---
My body is ready.
---
There is an internal battle going on in actiblizzard.  if wow classic is a huge sucess the old guard (what remains of the blizzard dev team) gets to call the shots in live.  if Classic fails Activision's team ruining WoW live gets to keep creating cancer.  
---
Activision wants to squelch any chance that blizzard might use this to separate themselves from activision.
---
"Str is the highest prio for dps, agi is at least as good for leveling bc of the defensive stats."
---
I was just correcting that str is not the highest prio for dps.  Agility is until some crazy threshold that can't be met in classic.
---
Hey, which one is you?
---
You are going to have confirmation bias if you are the type of individual ( like most people on Reddit) who joins in on a bunch of random conversations via the internet. If you are on this subreddit everyday, to you it might seem like the whole country is waiting for WoW. The reality is that there are millions of people who played classic and could not possibly give a shit it is being re-released. The market for classic WoW is going to be the generation that played before. You are kidding yourself if you think that 20 year old kids are going to enjoy a game like Classic World of Warcraft long term. The gameplay of classic is not immediately rewarding, it takes a long time and a lot of effort to achieve any sort of reward. Contrary to popular belief, people like being rewarded consistently which is why WoW changed to begin with. 
---
The main draw in popularity of classic World of Warcraft was the socialization element to the game. Which I shouldn’t need to go over. I remember seeing a lot of internet culture references years before they were popular on Facebook via trade chat. However, while when I was 13 I thought it was fun to be on an online gaming community before Reddit, Facebook or any other social media forum. As a 30-year-old man I just don’t care. In fact, the main reason that I don’t want to play classic wow is because I don’t want to have to deal with a bunch of random fucks on the Internet. The very thought of having to apply to a guild or attend some sort of meeting is hilarious. I can’t even begin to describe how stupid this is, but when I was 13 I did a lot of stupid things. It was something I realized when I attempted to play World of Warcraft recently. I hated having to be in a guild, I hated having to group with people, I hated having to have a microphone and use something called Discord. When I was in middle school I had only a few friends so this seemed important, but it is not any longer. The essence of WoW hasn’t changed, it’s still the same principle of getting a group together and killing something to get loot. The game hasn’t changed  at all, but I have and millions of others have as well. Most of them will not play classic World Of Warcraft. It had its time, and at one point it was an immensely popular gaming community. But it is never going to see those heights again, no where close.
---
D3 was honestly the first Blizzard game I played that I stopped playing within a month.  Starcraft, BW, D1, D2, Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3, WoW, Starcraft 2.. I played each of these religiously.  When d3 came out it was not good.  Honestly the way D3 is now is really fun for a couple of weeks per season and is sooo much better than release.  At least I made a couple hundred bucks on the RMAH before they closed it, but I did feel like I was cheating people out of their money by using it.  
---
Everything from D3 onwards has felt like it was released by a different company.
---
Fairly sure I've narrowed it down to Fem NE Druid (feral to 60 resto at 60) that I level on my own and a Human Priest that I solely level together with my friends who are also playing (shadow to 60 holy at 60), haven't decided male/fem yet I like both animations and look, convince me of either! I probably want to raid semi hardcore, not very into pvp other than the odd wpvp skirmish.
---
I really hope there will be an rppvp server cause I love having the rpers add to the world immersion and maybe even do a bit of my own... Thinking about starting a discord where I will add all the friends I make while levelling and  maybe by 60 there will be a whole community, or at least a whole new group of friends.
---
Will probably make another alt by the time my drood gets 60, thinking Warlock, Mage or Paladin.
---
How could you possibly know what kind of subscription data blizzard does or doesn’t have
---
Well, write down an essay about how everyone in the world are stupid for having hope and don't hate everything game companies do just because internet finds it fun to shit on them.
---
And read it when you're an adult and laugh at your self. We've all been there. Just chill a bit ok?
---
&gt;Arenas in TBC basically required 1 Druid in each and every team if you wanted to do well.
---
That's wrong.
---
Story of my life. I remember winning Cruel Barb in DM at level 19'ish on a 'Need' and promptly using it to level because I could equip it, since blue meant it was better than what I had equipped.
---
The orc axe racial is better for enhancement shamans. Resto and elemental though the troll racial and war stomp are both fantastic for. (Source: had both a troll and Tauren lvl 60 shaman in classic, Also now we understand how good the + weapon skill thing really is)
---
TBC and Wotlk are my dream. I wish people like you would just piss off. Let people play what they want. You're like the same people that would repost the "Wall of no" everytime someone brought up vanilla in the past.
---
Layering will mean a successful launch and you will see many players. Do you want to wait in an hour(s) queue when classic launches?
---
There will be RP servers. 
---
Blizz listened and are creating language specifics. They, at least, care. 
---
What more do you want?
---
Female troll ftw
---
It is already done for druids.  Hard core class theory crafter(s) and private server player(s) assign weights to each attribute and give each piece of armor a total over all score.
---
I would say that it's there and not going away. Tastosis and others are casting a few things in Korea and it's not going to go anywhere, even if it's smaller in the west. No threat from Activision, so to speak :-)
---
Crash team racing
---
Stay in school kid.
---
I was like, gunna use the same names/looks as my current wow characters.
---
Send imgur album with screen shots of your character killing drakkasath, azuregos and onxyia.
---
Was playing priest on a private server to prepare for Classic, but when I reached level 60 I respec'd to holy for better heals on raids since the guild was in need of healers. The problem is that I rarely could rarely roll need on caster DPS gear, so my character was hitting like a pillow in WPvE and playing the game wasn't very enjoying outside instances since I had bad DPS gear and lost all the good stuff that comes from shadowpriest spec that helps you sustaining mana and killing NPCs faster.
---
Excited for classic!  
---
My gut tells me that I should play rogue (daggers forever!)
---
My heart tells me that I should play Troll rogue since they are radical with the voodoo
---
My brain tells me that I should play Orc rogue as my main focus will be PVP  
---
I thought I wanted to play shadow priest (PVP focused) but I don't like the idea of people constantly asking me to heal when I won't want to.  
---
Or possible Orc Warlock as a curveball option?  
---
Not sure which of the 3 choices will satisfy my need for PVP while not gimping the rest of my play (semi-casual). I'm not a huge fan of alt characters as I won't as have much time to dedicate to the game as I did back in the day. 
---
Suggestions?
---
/r/woosh
---
If we forget beta, then it's 4 months at most over 2 years so not even 25% of Vanilla.
---
And this time, especially on PvP server, I expect that most of the people will try to get lvl60 before phase 2 and the big fight will almost only happen in that phase and then die out when BG are released. (but for this phase, it will be bloodbath)
---
I feel like you can skip out on CB, but you can't skip out on lethality in any rogue build - nor ruthlessness in a hemo build.
---
/r/woooosh
---
Non issue.
---
This might not be that far, when Disney buys Actiblizz
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamesn.com/disney-activision-blizzard-merger%3famp
---
I honestly dont classic is going to do super well. I think most people will quit a few months in when they realise how time consuming and unfair everything is. I was really hoping they would touch up the game a bit. Small not game changing qol updates. Class balancing obviously nothing big
---
I think when everyone was screamimg for classic wow they meant bc/early lk era. 
---
And im afraid Blizzard isnt on our side. You know they didnt want to make this game but the community twisted their arms. So i know they cant wait to goo " i told you so!"
---
I for one dont really care i plan to play all the way throughh
---
Actually in the last earnings call they revealed that they make a TON of their money off of the mtx and xpac cost. So its not really the icing, its more like the second layer of cake
---
I LOVE MadSeason!!!  He is the misterRogers/bobRoss of WoW YouTubers!!!
---
Lol druids don't ever "eat people" except maybe backpedaling keyboard turners in pugs.. you could kinda run flags with that spec but not half as good as a real flag running spec you'll oom too fast without the balance talents and lack swiftmend.
---
Number of people who chose to roll a Belf isn't really lore related, though. If you're just talking about their city up north, it's always been there.
---
There's a lot of people who feel like having a healer means they can just solely tap. I've encountered quite a few warlocks who did what you did, jsut without drinking. So they would wait until they were in combat to tap with all the waste that comes with it but neither tap nor drink/eat between pulls. Some people are the worst at this game and at life.
---
Not really, they are not needed either
---
Not much different than vent.
---
They would have to add more realms, or just leave people to deal with queues, adding more layers does nothing past a point. People seem to really be misunderstanding a layer. 
---
Layers are still a part of a realm, their combined population is the realm population cap. Say the realm maxes at 10k, and layers hold 2k each before making new ones. There will **only ever be 5 layers**, the *realm* can not handle more than 10k at a time, so it will not create more layers and suddenly have a pop cap of 12k.
---
There's no way that is correct, can you link?
---
So basically the custom lfg we have now. I am okay with that.
---
I think it's nice that the guilds get to organize their race to world first and monetize it the way they see fit.
---
Boi
---
There is an item that turns you into a Furlbog (maybe wrong spelling) but its cast animation looks like regular Priest and Paladin healing casts, so you can bait Mages CS and Priest Silences by casting the item. Just learned that from MadSeason's new YoutTube video. High Level IQ play for Priests and Pallies.
---
&gt;any green drop from BC is better than any epic drop from classic...
---
Wrong.
---
I hope you’re right but right now it’s not looking good.
---
I honestly could care less if theres any marketing. There will be plenty of people to play with that want to play classic. There could be 1 US server with 3000 active players and id be happy!
---
I too believe
---
Coordinating some tank buffs isn't the same as knowing how to heal with every class.
---
Josh,
---
I literally did a fist pump when Athalus announced that wow radio is making a comeback. Thanks for bringing us the news!
---
Because taunt is "combat range" ability, similar to Mortal Strike, Overpower, etc. it should have the increase. "Combat range" for warriors is 5 yards. And then Tauren get the (is it 2 yards or 3 yards?) bonus, increasing anything that is considered "combat range". Due to this, I always found Tauren a much more effective tank. The greater range on Taunt and all single target melee damage is super helpful.
---
For shouts and other AoE's, no, the range is not increased. Shouts don't have any modifiers to their range outside of Booming Voice.
---
Cleave functions the same way as all other melee, combat range abilities and gets the bonus range when striking the main target. The second (cleaved) target is most likely within a fixed range, not affected by Tauren size.
---
Not 100% how WW works, but the range is default 8 yards for all warriors. I doubt Tauren get an increase for this.
---
a rare source of reason with a brain between it's ears. A rarity among the rabid classic forever crowd (at least they are very vocal on this reddit)
---
&gt;  Blizzard would have rocks in their head if they thought it was a better  idea to create a TBC's worth of new content when people will pay for an  update of the old content. 
---
This is the very essence. Especially considering 2 major factors
---
nr1. the 'preserve history argument' that even lead to them recreating bugs and enforcing a 400 ms simulation on classic
---
nr2 the fact that any form of classic+ content would have to include TBC class/spec changes to begin with.
---
Why?
---
Because the players know what they could have. They could have 3 tank specs, viable(and optimal) hybrids and players will demand to get that the moment blizzard opens pandora's box to 'change' classic
---
While predictive casting of WotF looks cool, I actually think it's counterproductive. The biggest fear on that DR cycle will be the first one, and you're you're going to eat it once WotF goes down, whereas if you waited and used it reactively on the fear you would get a half duration one once WotF falls off
---
That's what I'm hoping will work well. Druids are capable of a couple dungeon farms, so it should synergize well with that.
---
Also being able to put standard enchants on mine and guildies gear will be nice.
---
They werent in vanilla so it does not make Sense. Thorium point has leveling quests not dungeon
---
Subbing back August 12.
---
It really makes you think about the current state of Blizzard.
---
Massive reaction at Blizzcon. Twitch blewup when Classic beta happened. *Clearly* there is big demand.
---
Yet, Blizz/ATVI sink no money into marketing?
---
What the fuck? 
---
You guys may not know this but typical marketing for AAA games is often greater than the actual game itself, even if the game is garbage (read: anthem). 
---
Yet they’ve done ZERO marketing for this game which clearly has a huge market.
---
2019 Blizz has their head completely up their ass.
---
I believe also as well
---
I'm not looking to go all out on enchanting and make proper gold with it. I'm asking how much value I will get out of it as a 'casual' enchanter.
---
now we just have to hope that classic p5 and p6 don't kill the users numbers like they do on crime servers. That's the only real danger to classic TBC
---
Those people destroyed WoW
---
Downriver/Detroit area what’s up
---
Also remember to not accidentally end up hated with Cenarion Circle before AQ is released.
---
TBH most feral I met on private servers were tanks and for those I can say for sure that all of them were very skilled and Id taken any of them in my raid over the average tauren warrior offtank who actually only just wants his bone reavers edge... its probably the same for the feral dps vs rogues.
---
And we are talking about PUGs not progress raiding btw...
---
Mhm you can watch a non stop marathon of this stuff on America channels like fox news
---
My Dad said he saw a classic wow advert on tv a month or so ago during a gaming tourney.
---
I mean, I fully understand the entirely overused and outdated joke. But in this context it doesn’t apply because it’s factually false.
---
At the end of my play sessions back in vanilla I would always do a lap or 3 to mine the heck out of 1k. I lived that zone. It paid for my mount when I hit 40.
---
Best in Slot. So the best piece of gear for a helm, chest, etc.
---
its cause they fuck you
---
They are two separate downloads
---
I get you don't like them but they are dailies all in but name. They are also about as mandatory as dailies were since atleast cata.
---
Rogues in battlegrounds suck; in *world* PVP they're the bee's knees.  My 2¢.  
---
Shadow priests are practically unstoppable in 1v1/wPVP, and they can drop shadow form and save the day in a BG.  
---
For everything other than PVP, e.g., farming, dungeons, professions, gathering, etc., I'd go rogue.
---
How is the whole zone flooded but the race track still intact? That's the lowest part of TN. Also where does all that water come from?
---
My dad asked me about classic cuz he saw an ad on YouTube. I think they are just directing advertisement towards people who don’t know what it is.
---
So will my 8700k GTX1080 rig be able to run it ok in 1440p?
---
Really? Good - hadn't looked yet
---
Let me add: Druid feral PvP requires gear that hard to get.
---
* You pretty much need the PvP 4 set speed bonus to deal with certain classes well, but that's a long rank 8 grind, usually rank 10 if you want to sub out an item.
---
* The first decent weapon comes from a quest in DM.
---
* But to replace it, you have to either PvP grind AV to exalted or fish up a boss in ZG or be in a BWL guild to grab a trash mob drop.
---
* The first actual druid weapon comes from AQ20, then AQ40 if you're in a guild good enough to clear AQ40.
---
There are addons already with classic client support like Questie that worked during the beta. I'll just use Elv UI with default settings and Questie during early levels and worry about tweaking and the rest of my addons later on.
---
You should probably look before posting. This question gets asked all the time.
---
I find it strange that everyone wants character classes to be frozen. It is as much the Classic environment to have all the classes get rebalanced every few months as anything else.
---
If there is any addon I want to work in classic, it's blockchinese.
---
It has been a necessity being on the illidown server.
---
Your guild is going to die quickly if you let random chance decide who gets loot. Why would I show any loyalty to a guild that will not reward it? Why log it on progression nights when I can just log in for farmed bosses and be just as likely to get loot?
---
For me a Thousand Needles i really hated what they did to that zone in Cata
---
sounds like a horrible raid management. if the replacement is not in front of the raid within 5-10 minutes another one takes that place.
---
Me and brother will both be returning after a long hiatus. We're in Flushing just west of Flint. First 2 rounds on me at The Gallows' End Tavern.
---
Just because values have been set to 1.12 doesn’t mean all the content will be released. We already have confirmation that loot will be progressive, as an example relics won’t be added until later phases, and Librams won’t make an appearance until AQ is out.
---
Pretty much any class is at a massive disadvantage if their opponent is using engi and they arent. Even mage vs war becomes loseable if the war is using all his tricks effectively.
---
I doubt it since no one will be actually playing in the game world, just creating characters.
---
Those are all horde only quests. They added revantusk village fairly late in vanilla, so the items form those quests have much better itemized rewards than other quests. 
---
The fishing pole and rune of the guard captain are easily the worst offenders.
---
It barely matter that they get sparse loot in BWL because half their pre-raid gear is BiS through Naxx anyway
---
I don't wanna fight over lvl 12 quests with 25 people though.
---
Healing isn't hard in Vanilla. Most healers use a few ranks of the same handful of spells and that's it. If anything, it's easier to coordinate. Pserver raiders don't have CLs and the only people talking about bringing them back are returning people fueled by nostalgia.
---
The idea of Class Leaders is beyond obsolete and we'll have to agree to disagree.
---
Are you kidding me? Activision is not spending a dime on this project. In their mind, this is either an experiment they are going to execute with the smallest budget possible, or it'll be a huge profit success.
---
The moment they realise Classic is profitable, they will bring the Cash Shop to it. Manage your expectations, Be ready so it'll hurt less.
---
I can't attest accurately to what specifically was or was not in a game from 15 years ago. 
---
I think anyone saying they remember those intracacies and are able to perfectly seperate vanilla TBC wotlk etc in their minds, I'd say they are probably fooling themselves a little bit.
---
That said, if they weren't originally in vanilla, idk whether they will be in or not. 
---
Afaik there was a quest or two for BRS/BRD at thorium, but my most recent vanilla experience was private server so that could be false (although I doubt they messed up on something that big)
---
The cloth quartermaster quests weren't in at 1.12 either but blizz said they will be in the game at release, so I'm not really sure what blizz' plan even is for making it perfectly 2004-esque.
---
I still think the thorium point quests will be there, if not phase 1 then phase 2. I think the CC quests not being at cenarion hold is def about AQ.
---
Why have people play for free on pservers when you can get paid? After a little bit all they need to invest is server maintainence, then it's just free money to them. With how much they make off of subs already, they probably don't need any new subs to afford it, every new subs is just icing for them.
---
I  for one will not be subbing before the game is playable.   The worst thing blizzard could do imo is assume they can infer population from the ammount of people that are willing to pay extra to get a 2 week naming headstart.
---
He is the Australian performing the interviews and hosting.
---
There should be a connection between PvP and PvE. If you get a great weapon or piece of armor in a raid it should give you an advantage in PvP. Resilience destroyed this and isolated both parts of the game. It was just another way of streamlining the game.
---
Well since I made the mistake last time of making the Mage after I already had a holy paladin at 60.  
---
It'll be Mage for my solo leveling, Paladin for when I play with my friends, and maybe a Rogue later on.
---
Every server, especially a login server can be DDoS-ed so yes, we'll probably get some connection issues.
---
"Act unfarly to gain advantages", thanks for confirming its cheating.
---
Soooooo tbc?  Idk how you think changing class balance doesn't change the core gameplay lol...
---
I think most people have a general idea of 1 race/class combo. Making a spread sheet of multiple characters with names and professions all picked out is getting pretty hardcore
---
Interesting experience, thank you for sharing. And yea i think that armor stat was a bit low, would be curious to see what gear you used at the time.
---
RESILIANCE &lt; stat that split the game and RUINED IT
---
Oh man Athalus, what a long time ago it was I was chilling playing while listening to him and Take 5.
---
Tanking trinkets aren't hard. Your BiS come from the Rend quest in UBRS and from Ony head. You can buy a warden staff off of the AH if you aren't using MCP. Hell, you can take the thick hide talent if you aren't armor capped from gear already.
---
Tons
---
They will re-release the original episode.  I think they’re called “reruns”.
---
You wouldn’t get to low HP if you were Orc because you’d resist the stun.
---
It is what you make of it. Never hurts to try. Would work great for dungeons and that's not a bad way of levling. You can always respec if it doesn't work out :)
---
Be lucky to even remember lol
---
Hinterlands, thorium point and silithus quests was added later stage, that is a fact. As you said it remains what makes sense and not
---
No changes
---
still oissed about not being able to fap to a real starfire?
---
i have played the warcraft series since 1 on dos, so longer than you. i dont hate everything blizzard does but they have clearly botched many things in the last 10 years and many people do not trust them. seems like you are the one that needs to grow up and realize that the world isnt perfect and sunshine all the time.
---
Yeah but for a questionable target audience. I would rather play with other adults.
---
It was Fury until we learned /sit crits wouldnt work.  Arms adds so much utility that it way bettter imo. Best thing about Fury is that 5% crit chance
---
I was talking about China since that's what the previous poster mentioned. It's happening in most really large games.. LOL, WOW, Fortnite etc. 
---
Also as you mentioned it helps explain the shift to mobile, because mobile is a far more common device type over there vs PCs.
---
The days of large companies primarily targeting NA/EU PC players as their primary demographic with these games have been trending downward. 
---
The new hot thing is to chase the mobile Asian market and get kiddies hooked on lootboxes( also becoming more challenging in EU vs Asia) and micro-transactions. 
---
I hate it, but it's just been a trend worth recognizing over the last 3+ years. No use trying to ignore the reality of it.
---
I would not level engineering without mining so in that case i would go that way first and then level enchanting instead of mining.  
---
Also unless you pvp i don't find much use for engineering in vanilla, With skinning you can be lucky and make some really nice gold when skinning the beast, black drakes and other bosses suchs as Onyxia but in that case you probably have to put the stuff in a guild bank.
---
&gt;The shaman should be leveling by using white attacks whether he goes ele, enhance, or resto.  The auto attack damage is really good and efficient way to regen mana after using some shocks and totems at the start of the pull.  Remember that the attack swing timer gets reset anytime you cast a spell with a cast timer.  Probably you should both be tanking separately since the shaman will do best casting the newest trained shock and newest trained weapon enchantment.  Most times that will be earthshock and rock biter, so the druid will want to feral tank a second mob while the shaman tanks the first, and just share the stoneskin totem and grace of air.  
---
&gt;I think no matter what spec you end up on you should get the elemental clear casting talent at level 20 to start.  From there you can decide if you want to continue up to the 100% critical damage talent, or go to stormstrike in the enhancement tree.  If you do want the 100% critical damage in elemental, then you can either finish you last 30 points in resto with amazing QOL improvements, or enhancement with flurry, a small bit of crit, and faster cast time on ghost wolf to play catch up with the druid.
---
It is almost time.
---
Seriously? You go to add friend and type in the name. Did you even try to look this up before posting?
---
It's a meme
---
Posting is actually a decent amount of effort on this subreddit. The character limit has defeated me many times
---
that'd be the incredibly stupid way to implement layers.  have 1 server and enough layers to fill up the space on that server.  and when layers are gone, you have 1 server with 80% of its space doing literally nothing.
---
more likely, the way everybody else does it, have 1 server for the database and many other servers connect to that for each layer.  this way you can scale up or down as much as you need.
---
The ancient greeks had it figured out already with minotaurs yo
---
What lol. You think Blizzard has been collecting subscriptions for 15 years and not keeping track? That’s not how it works.
---
I'm just saving names and coming back a week later to crat faces
---
Literally are you this dense? Just because YOU think it's unfair doesn't mean that it fits the criteria of cheating because THE COMPANY says it's NOT cheating.
---
Yup. Don't switch to Prot until 60.
---
What? The fact that when you're dead your body deteriorates and you cease to exist on this planet. Basic stuff here lol.
---
It's had to keep up with modern mmos, which are way more fast paced than vanilla. Most people today don't want to spend an hour in a flight path, too have to turn around after talking to an npc.
---
Been talked to death here but Bears are perfectly viable in raids. Really easy early gearing, and decent offtanks long term. Never going to be a main tank or part of the top couple raid guilds realistically, but you have to take into account most raiding guilds are more focused on a combination of what works and who actually shows up.
---
Paladin is another story, I've seen nothing good on that front.
---
Barron's duh.
---
People want high levels as an allied race and blizzard always tells them they are called blood elves now and they get upset.
---
They let the devs take an extra 20 mins in the ball pit?
---
Exactly!  Classes weren't frozen in vanilla, therefore balance IS no changes.
---
Check out money bags over here with his ground clutter back then!
---
It’s such bs their asking for sub money for that. 14 days otherwise wasted
---
I think part of the problem is that past tier 1.5, everything is 40-man content.  When you have 40 people instead of 5 or 10, or even 20, you have more room for specialists to shine, and less room for hybrids and their hybrid tax.
---
Let's put it into the perspective of an IT department.  If you are the only person in IT in your company, you do everything.  You do the desktops, servers, network, printers, mobile devices, and everything in between.  If you have a staff of a dozen people, then you might have a couple desktop folk, a couple server folk, a couple in networking, and a couple who work on printers and mobile devices.  If your staff is 40 people, now the desktop team has images and applications, the server guys each have their own systems, there are people who specifically do network hardware and network software.
---
So if you're in a small environment, then being able to do a little bit of everything is necessary.  And in a large environment, you're allowed to become really good at a couple of things.
---
In a 5-man dungeon, the kitty druid can off-tank, off-heal, and decurse.  In a 40-man raid, you can have a mage or a resto druid decurse without leaving form, you have plenty of dedicated off-tanks who can off-tank, and plenty of healers to cover for each other.
---
Since the highest 5-man content is Strat, Scholo, and Dire Maul (which are all pre-raid), and the highest 20-man content is AQ20 (which gives gear previous to BWL, AQ40, and Naxx), the focus at end-game is on 40-man raids, in which specialists reign supreme.
---
This argument doesn’t make any sense. 
---
“Classes got updates and balancing in vanilla so they should in classic.”
---
.....no, not if the purpose is to recreate the game. The goal would be would be to remake it as it is, not with additional class balancing and updates.
---
Damage Meter, Unit Frames, OmniCC, MoveAnything(!), Bartender
---
It is, but people use that as a reason to disregard people’s requests for High Elves on the alliance.
---
Felwood as an Alliance is hell.
---
Cataclysm busted a massive hole in the mountains between 1k needles and the ocean. The basin is actually well below sea level, so when the mountains broke apart the sea came rushing in. 
---
The old racetrack isn't really intact (though you can still find it if you travel to the bottom). The old inhabitants that didnt drown built a barge over the same spot where they still bicker back and forth about gnome/goblin engineering.
---
Yea I wouldn’t want AP for pvp but from what I read it’s needed for pve if you’re not the winters chill mage, are you saying you can raid just fine as a pvp specced mage? Having not played in real vanilla I really don’t know how serious the raid comps will be.
---
Barrens was possibly the worst designed zone and we all loved it for it
---
When I get leg backstabbed by a defies goon in westfall and die when he was in front of me.

Launch is going to be big enough as it is.

Don’t you have to include her realm as well.
---
As I said, without rare recipies its really just a useless moneysink. I would not recommend it. The trinket is neat but nothing groundbreaking since its a Level50 Blue.
---
My original post there is a point system to reward loyal members, but players will use it sparingly.     
---
Thank you for reading.
---
If you have no intention of completing any raid, PvPing is your only other option to obtain gear. It doesn't matter what class you are. Once you hit Pre-Raid BiS... that's it. You're BiS for a long time if you don't want to raid.
---
Remember, the PvP Ranks and Gear won't even be available at launch. I believe it's the end of P2 or something when you can even start grinding for the gear? That means you won't feasibly get PvP gear for probably 6+ months after launch.
---
Untamed Blade is also an excellent choice. It is not as good as BRE, Ashkandi or Sulfuras but it is damn close. It drops off 1st boss in BWL...super easy to get. If you can kill Rag you might as well swing the raid by BWL immediately after to kill Razorgore.
---
I'm subscribed so I don't feel guilty about playing on p servers.
---
But how do I filter out your site when I Google something so I only see classicdb?
---
I can't be fucked with sifting through your tbc/wotlk shit to find the item I am looking for I ly to see it magically have +rating or some BS.
---
Not subbed for over 10 years. Will resub about a week before name reserves open. That gives me enough time to work out any possible issues with reinstalling the client.
---
It is such bs they are asking for sub money for that. 14 days otherwise wasted (fk retail). I know some ppl are enthralled with classic they’ll defend any malicious cashgrab blizzard does (such as the beta, the blizzcon and the sub one), but for anyone with a half decent morale compass it’s tough to make yourself give this corporation money.

I couldn't find a single instance of my specific question getting asked and answered definitively. Can you provide a link? My first reply was assuming you had info from elsewhere besides this sub.
---
According to a quick google-search the vanilla armor-cap was 20708 for 75% damage-reduction against a level 63 boss.
---
Implying you can easily reach that with the tanking trinkets, warden staff and thick hide sounds a bit unrealisitc. I had all of that stuff and as I said, I was sitting at 11.8k.
---
Tf are you talking about?
---
The dude I responded too literally said 
---
“You think they do but they don’t”
---
To a comment basically saying blizzard has the sub data I’m sure they have a decent idea.
---
He’s claiming blizzard doesn’t have the data and I’m saying of course they do. So what’s your point here exactly
---
I would normally consider myself a bit of a completionist, but fuck that quest. It's not happening. I refuse.
---
I quit in early Wotlk before ulduar was released and haven't played a blizzard game since then.  I don't even have a battle.net account yet.
---
So you just using a DKP variant, then. Good on you, it's the easiest loot system to maintain.
---
And my axe also believes
---
whirlwind is an AoE effect. As such it only counts for the center to figure whether or not a target can be hit. Normal melee abilities only require the sphere of influence to be within your striking range. In other words tauren's ww has the same range like any other, but npcs are not moving in as close as they can hit you from further away
---
cleave's main target hit has more range as it is a targeted ability. The cleave radius is determined as AoE scan from that target's center. So it completely depends on the situation as to whether your hit box is a benefit or curse for that. Mainly because it only affects how targets may position around you
---
I plan to sub at the start of August to get my name reserved.
---
That's about it. I have zero interest in any other blizzard game.
---
It's also BiS when it comes to mitigation for bear tanks, along with Mark of Tyranny.
---
ele doesn't get really strong until end game gear, wouldn't advise is at launch in just pre bis gear.
---
Because a 15 yo game...
---
&gt; My hope was that I could get pre-raid BiS and then pvp for ranking for gear. 
---
You can do whatever you want in this game. Go for it. It'll just be a different grind, is all. 
---
&gt; The fact that it seems like essentially every hybrid has to heal 
---
False. There will be plenty of guilds or pugs(eww) where they take you as-is and you just do your best with whatever spec you have.
---
Problem is that your statement is only really comparable in the MC/BWL era. AQ40/Naxxramas gear *annihilates* the PvP epics/blues you'll end up in (provided you only play PvP) - and this is provided that you spend the *months* grinding for your GM/HWL gear. 
---
Which is only really comparable to BWL, which is both a generally simple raid and can be completed in the prebis blues you get from a few days of grinding dungeons.
---
Especially for some classes this is tough. PvP warriors, for example, are stuck with The Unstoppable Force until Grand Marshall or High Warlord, whereas any schmuck that can down Nefarian has potential to get a sword that's slightly *better* than the rank 14 weapon. And trust me, killing Nefarian is a whoooole lot easier and faster than it is to get to rank 14.
---
Vanilla PvP all but requires you to be active and successful in PvE aswell. Which is just fine, since there's not really any serious competition to it (in terms of rating or simillar).
---
The problem comes in when you have a more 'serious' environment in the arenas. This mode that commanded a time investment too, to compete in. This, coupled with the time required for raiding, is much more than what could be expected, and such it was necessary to divide the two gameplay loops.
---
Is it just me, or are there some guys who can't keep in time and are a bit off at some points. Makes me kinda cringe suddenly hearing that little mistakes after listening for so long to the original theme.
---
Joining the club, haven't been subscribed for many years now, will do on launch date. I honestly don't even remember my character name, so early name reservation isn't gonna be a big deal for me
---
The only classic city not designed by Aaron if I remember right. I actually like the undercity, more than iron forge in fact. The city I dislike is thunder bluff, everything is rotated in odd angles

There is way better things to do than farm the blue sinew. All it does is give 2 extra slots for ammo.

To me it’s not about that. I’m just really fucking excited to play, and the idea of making my character(s) soon is really exciting to me. People gotta stop making this about money. Classic is almost here. Let’s be happy about that.

Paladin's simply are not even a viable Tank. There's no question about it. They have no taunt or means of realistically holding threat. They can succeed a bit in dungeons but that's the limit.

That zone with the music playing is just so amazing. My first character was a gnome warlock and when i rolled over from Dun Morough into that zone and the music switched over it was so epic at the time.
---
what a fool
---
The reason why it is said that engineering is better for Hunter than for other classes is because Hunter can change trinkets / items during fight while in combat (drop combat with Feign death). That is why you can cycle items with cooldown. 
---
It is SUPER EFFECTIVE in pvp, and mediocre/ good in pve to boost your dps (end game dps)
---
You need to learn to read. I'm saying you can't get pally buffs as horde, so being a horde druid just sucks.

there is a way to switch or we have to up the skill again ? Not better buying gnome/gobelin (depending of if i'm gobelin or gnome) to someone ?

Thanks You!

Its grinding my gears for days that I couldnt remember which bar addon I used during my wow time.
---
Fuck wrath, one of the worst expansions ever made. It introduced welfare epics in full force in addition to sharding. What a trainwreck.
---
You vastly underestimate the population and love for WoW. There will never be a population problem on any Blizzard hosted WoW game/server...period. 
---
There is no downside to them releasing all expansions. You can't simply release vanilla and then say too bad to everyone else. The person who prefers TBC is equally as important as the person who prefers vanilla.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Time locked progression, go through them all then reset. Whatever. You should never ever ever say "no", only "how can we make this work".
---
Once again, you need to drop the hardcore or strategy based mindset when talking about the average player.  This is not the norm for wow or any game in terms of the average player, and it never will be.  We aren’t discussing what’s the best possible strategies in this conversation, we were discussing abilities that are fun to use.

Drop 3 points in deadliness for improved gouge.  A short combat reset (it varies) you can restealth off of gouge alone.

&gt;The only way to get the classic CE pets is if you've bought the vanilla CE 15 years ago. There is no way to get them now.
---
As it should be. Just because it's not the old CE, doesn't mean they didn't release a CE with Classic.
---
Oh my b, it only contains Vanilla related items, 30 days of game time (for Classic WoW) and was announced the same hour as WoW Classic was.
---
Some might find the barrens big and boring but I was really sad that I didn't recognize it after cataclysm. Thousand needles, Tanaris / shimmering flats too.

You should probably confirm that your account wasn't stolen in the interim.

The pvp gear doesn’t do much for Elly. It’s an Enhance set.

Watched for pantheon. I can't fucking wait for that game and I've never played a game like EQ. Of course I'm playing classic, but I probably won't be when pantheon comes out!
---
Yes, sometimes people make false jokes. Calm down. Jesus.
---
No, it wasn't. It's a bunch of people who are guessing the answers, going back weeks and months, with many of them arguing about the 'answers'
---
You still haven't provided a single link to a definitive answer, btw.
---
Why do you reply if you have no intention of helping?
---
I was hoping someone who isn't guessing or being a troll, but rather has found an authoritative source with an actual blizzard quote or something similar could chime in here. Is that really asking too much of this sub?
---
13 augusth
---
I broke the dam
---
I tried it and it doesn’t work. Maybe I’m doing something wrong?
---
But what happens if there are less than 1k people even after the layers get removed which will be within the first few months?
---
I don't want to be "that guy", but this still won't be as common as people make it out to be. Hybrids NEED to know that, on average, raids will expect them to Heal/Support. It's cruel to tell someone otherwise and for them to spend months getting to 60 thinking they'll easily find raid spots.
---
To the OP: Play what you want to play and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you're set on Ele, do it! But realize you'll have some limitations. If you're cool with those, great! That's all that matters.
---
private server - starting with lvl 60 and best gear so you can try every class a bit

"Let's spend countless millions remaking the entire game world and then also make it obsolete by making people stay in cities from level 15."

Genius move. Money, time and effort well spent Blizzard.

wont be gearscore, but some people will have the pre raid bis list saved somewhere and use that no doubt
---
I've had warlock friends that do it because they're lazy and it drove me up a wall.  I'd ask them nicely to drink OOC and they would just say "it's your job to heal, so heal me."  Let's just say they died more than they should've lol
---
Literally no one cares about streamer drama
---
My main concerns is that it's a low droprate in an early zone and the competition for it will be stupid at launch. I'm skipping it and moving on to literally anything else.
---
posting on the wrong subreddit, that's what you're doing wrong.
---
So he has fallen because he follows a girl on twitter that has a bit of drama about her? Which isnt related to classic wow or even retail.. what?
---
Enchanting requires an investment of time - both to get the recipes, and to spend time providing the service in trade chat.
---
Historically Blizzard prepares for a significantly higher number than they're expecting. This case is odd because they have to hit the number in a sweet spot on every server. It won't go perfectly no matter what
---
Classic and Blizzard have very little to do with one another tbh
---
Holy Priest or Frost Mage? I play warrior tank in retail in mythic + dungeons. I’ll be wanting to raid.
---
Pretty sure you only get 3 names to reserve or is it 3 names per server?
---
He's my current 'can't sleep background noise' on YouTube, l over all his videos. Very laid back but still excellently put togerher
---
Actually I think it’s dating your mom and getting you, I was so disappointed
---
I've been fiending for WoW pretty bad lately so I may end up subscribing prior to August 12th to scratch that itch. The pre-release name reservation will be important for me and my friends so we can all coordinate to be on the same realm.
---
He’s the man
---
Yes, it was, lol. I went through and read them. Did you even take the 3 minutes to pull up your launcher and see that there is a separate section in the drop down menu for wow classic?
---
Or did you take the 10 seconds of critical thinking to realize it makes 0 sense that you would need to download all the expansions to play classic?
---
It’s a separate download. I’m not linking anything that you can find in less than a minute on your own.
---
There is a belief that sit/crit won't work, although it does work on the beta thanks to spell batching abuse.  
---
There is another belief that magical effects that are chance on hit wont be effected by spell dmg, it was proven in the beta that they are.  
---
There is the belief that any loss of character control be it to CC, flight paths, and even mounting causes you to lose reck stacks. This was proven to be false in the beta. Only swapping weapons, zoning in or out, or attacking causes you to lose your bomb.  
---
There is some confusion about SoR talents increasing dmg before or after spell dmg, I still havent discovered which to be the case. There is a possible dmg change from what were used to.  
---
On the beta servers SoR doesnt proc chance on hit effects, pserver players tend to stack a lot of chance on hit effects to maximize the reckbomb dmg. Heart of Wyrmthalak, Elements deck, Death bringer weapon, Shadow Oil, chili pepper, life steal. A single melee attack had double the chance to  proc 7 or more different on hit effects, an absolute truck load worth of dmg. This is the single biggest change from what people are used to. No more abusing a busted mechanic.  
---
Reck bombs are only viable if they put you within range of quickly landing a hammer of wrath on the target.  For a supportive role you need to be able to quickly kill your attacker and resume healing. In a 1v1 scenario investing 25 points in something, just to watch the other guy step out of combat and reset the fight isnt viable. It's go big or go home.
---
2005 was a different time.
---
Well that's because it's impossible to know! And we humans are thankfully more than that.
---
That is a very good point, paying gold to respec to something that lets me press frostbolt a million times more effectively doesnt sound like something Ill wanna do lol. I will try the private server priest too, thanks!
---
It simply allows trolls to have a conditional huge burst in damage.
---
Shamans / disc preists can abuse "Berskering -&gt; LHW/Lesser heal" spam.
---
Enhance Shams /warriors with flurry &amp; 43&amp; berserking turn a 4.00 speed 2h into a 1.59 speed weapon, within the window allowing for up to 7 hits (assuming flurry can be procced a second time in that span)
---
Hunters can turn any ranged weapon into an actual machine gun with a combination of Rapid fire, Berserking, &amp; Aspect of the Hawk proc( 3.6 attack speed ranged would would become [ 3.60 * (0.57) * (0.6) * (0.7) * [0.85] ] = ~0.5, the actual speed of the ranged attack cooldown.
---
Combat rogues with berserking, SnD and blade flurry could also get very fast attack speed to take full advantage of wind fury and sword spec proc.
---
During a PvE raid fight, it would help during a short period of needing to burst damage, but your overall dps wouldn't be increased as much as you'd think just because the attack speed window is so small and you need to activate it at low health with other stacking attack speed multipliers.
---
I feel its better on a healer class for that "oh no, i need fast heals now" as both 1.5 second heals would be reduced down to about 1 second making them very reliable to get off when you're naturally already at low health and need to spam heals. Alternatively niche cases like an enhance shaman twink at 39 who lacks storm strike but still needs to get in an extra hit somewhere when taking damage.  Berserking could supply you reliable with an extra melee swing that could potential proc flurry / windfury to nuke down a target.
---
For PvP again, stuns and CC are what will kill you, and being able to resist a majority of them by sheer luck passively is still a greater impact.
---
Overall, its a solid racial without a downside like bloodfury, but you still need to compare berserking to woft, stun resist, or warstomp.  All of them are good options and hard to choose one over another. Except stun resistance. Stun resistance is king.
---
I’m sure, and I was playing blood elf to, I had just started him.
---
I didn’t know people still make these stupid jokes
---
Devs are just as bad as the marketing team.
---
Look no further than retail's Q&amp;A's, they don't give a fuck about Warcraft.
---
yeah I thought it was for classic at first too. mostly because of the rag and as you said - the timing
---
My understanding was 3 names per server
---
Did you visit her or something😂
---
Parts of eastern Tanaris are also flooded. Steamwheedle Port was destroyed iirc.
---
&gt; Echeyakee
---
Now there's a name I haven't heard in a very long time
---
So I could drop Enemy Cast Bars for ElvUI?
---
If your gonna make a stupid joke it should at least  be appropriate given the context.
---
It would be like me saying you think you do but you don’t in reply to your comment here. It doesn’t make sense
---
I'm 90% sure that there were already soul shard bags in 1.12, which was a *major* boon.  I remember having to farm up two mooncloth bags' worth of shards just to prep *for* the raid prep before those were introduced.
---
Fish aren't free. Opportunity cost.
---
Lock with tailoring kind of doesn't make sense until phase 4 IMO, because of the % hit gained from bloodvine set really being the only improvement over the other non tailoring items available from DM and quests.  Tailoring is much better on the priest for the BOP truefaith vest being so high on healing power.  
---
My favorite class race combos are male orc warlock, troll male priest, and troll female warrior.
---
As a PVP oriented person I agree with your takes. Some people (not that I am calling anyone out directly) that PvE feel entitled because they are clearing the hardest content they should have the best gear and therefore, be stronger than everyone else. 
---
Some PvE pieces could be implemented in PVP (primarily weapons, nice trinkets, or a few pieces here or there), but you still had to balance an appropriate level of resil and stam so you don't get gibbed. Without resil in the expansions, you'd run into vanilla AQ/Naxx PVP where geared people are getting 2-4 shotted by geared people, that's not really PVP. 
---
Both PvP and PvE take large time investments to excel at, so effectively whoever can dedicate the most time should be the best, but I disagree with that, since time=/=skill. You'd often find people who cleared scripted PvE content, decked out in gear, get rolled in PvP due completely different play styles and the element of playing against another human.
---
Yeah, this thing called logic.
---
Only way there isn't a 6 hour queue on a server with 20k people trying to play on it is if
---
A - they keep layering (which they cant)
---
B - they let 10k+ the server cap
---
unlike shaman's lightening shield which only works on physical attacks...
---
Lightning shield works 1:1 the same exact way as shadowguard with 2 minor differences.  Shadow guard generates zero threat, and deals shadow instead of nature.
---
STV and Barrens
---
Defias Pillager's Fireball hits you for 84.
---
Sadly, and I’m kind of ashamed to admit it, but if they sold mounts on an in game store I could actually play Tauren and would probably spend fifteen bucks not to look like an idiot on a kodo
---
Engineering is important for hunters and it boils down to the fact that the class barely has any AoE. Bombs/sappers are the only way to significantly make up for that.
---
The difference between an engineer and a non engineer hunter is big. By the end of the night an engineer will likely have done a few hundred thousand points of damage more than the non engineer.
---
Other company already beat them to the market, exact same gameplay and grapics. Only a Diablo fan qould reallybplay that, even in China, so they sacrifice PR for nothing really, they cant lauch the game.
---
I am not subbed, and will only sub to save my name before launch.
---
I personally don’t like murder for pvp. 2% is enough IMO to take it with other talents. I prefer something like https://classicdb.ch/?talent&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app#fhe0oxubZhZxMjochRo
---
Can take the points out if imp kidney to put in deadliness. From my experience, hemo is about control. Cc, cc, cc. Get them combo points. You as little energy hemo costs, you build Cp’s so fast and destroy some people in the first couple cc’s. Extremely fun build. Throw in some thistle tea and the zg trinket... nom nom nom
---
Learn the rules before you learn when to break them.
---
Ok?
---
Ty alot for the reply.
---
Wait what? A level 40 helm was BiS?
---
Of course you can find raids in any specs, I've been to raiding guilds in wod where they bring in dps that did less dmg than tanks. There are guilds for everyone no matter how bad you are, you'd just have to accept that you won't get into high tier guild with meme specs
---
Until its released, no one will know for 1000%. They could change it day before. Wait til the 13th.
---
Even then I'm sure they'll be an addon made that'll at least autobuy to fill your quiver/ammo pouch every time you hit an ammo vendor.
---
Questie is super controversial but I loved using it on the Stress Tests to make sure I didn't miss any quests in Tirisfal Glades. Provides a nice list of all quests you haven't done yet in the zone. I read the quests anyways, even in Retail, so having a quest helper to me isn't a big deal.
---
But it is definitely not required, i'd just heavily recommend it if you're going for reputation like me.
---
Is there any build that is a hybrid shadow/healer? I’d like to play shadow but still have a place healing in raids/5 mans. Or is it going to be a full respec every time?
---
Yea I'm saying it would have been easier for OP to just search his question in the sub then make the 1000th post about it
---
The resource cost isn't doing berserking any favors either
---
Hex of weakness messes up paladins pretty badly, too.
---
And berserking into shadow burn is lights out for alliance healers.
---
Switching between the witcher 3 and red dead redemption 2 because I bought both of them last year and I just switched jobs and finally have time
---
This is hilarious
---
Yup, if it hasn't been used in over a decade of vanilla private servers it won't be used ever
---
I used to raid as an undead prot warrior on Dragonmaw towards the end of Vanilla and into TBC.  
---
I want to roll a horde prot warrior, eventually trying out fury prot.  I want to be the king of threat gen, and I’m torn between Orc or Troll.  
---
How do I attac as well as protec?
---
China has always had the population, but they're getting better infrastructure all the time, and even a bit of expendable income. Even if companies made a fraction in China of what they make per person off of a game in EU/NA, the number of users more than makes up for that gap.
---
This, I still rarely go to that zone now because of the flooding. It really ruined the thematic of it for me.
---
I don't work for blizzard and neither do you- have a great day, oh wait it's raining wherever you go... good luck sweetie!
---
I mean, I get where you come from. They wanna make the most money possible.
---
But tbh, that is exactly why I don't think they will go overboard with mtx. I can probably see character transfers some day, maybe but really just maybe race changes. But actually I don't even think they will go that because of the aforementioned reason: they wanna make money. And they should know damn well by now that those people they are bringing back with the Classic release just drove away from the game because of things like mtx. And if Blizz wants this project to succeed and make money, they need to keep the players subbed.
---
I mean, imagine being Blizz and having to tell your investors how you managed to bring back millions of dollars in sub fees and then turning them away because you got too greedy. The investors would kill them.
---
Think it would just further cement the idea in my head that this is the WoW people really want. Not BfA trash
---
&gt; By limiting pve viability to only pveing you lock out way to many people from wanting to pve
---
Do you see how stupid this sounds?
---
Yea, not really true. I just leveled to 40 as elemental and only had to drink about every 5 mobs. Yes, there is more time spent drinking, but you kill a lot faster than enhancement.  The real benefit for enh is ghost wolf.
---
Linking a terribly weak support weapon from the MC-era isn't really comparable to some of the stronger vanilla weapons. Something like Dark Edge of Insanity or Might of Menethil blows that out of the water.
---
Ahh okay, that does make sense.
---
Id avoid rogue, the class that started my carpal tunnel
---
now pally... that you can play lol
---
Eazy ignore whoever says that :-)
---
Titan Panel, Atlasloot, Gatherer, CT-raid, DBM, Recount.
---
I’m fully aware
---
why would I want that dog shit weapon if I'm only 20 points in holy?
---
Fun is subjective. You taking pvp or pve late game? Maybe consider priest healer and respec shadow. I’d rather do that than respec a pally but if that’s fun do it
---
I’ll step up my game to provide an authentic barrens char experience for you.
---
Just allow me some time before launch to revert to the mentality of my 20 year old immature self.
---
I don’t care. I’ll say what I want.
---
Now this is a decent topic.
---
Do you want to be rich and independent or loved by groups if you can find one?
---
Anyone have experience playing a female dwarf paladin? Great animations (esp heal and 2H special) but not sure if I could commit to looking at one as main character.
---
Escape From Tarkov.
---
Even if the pvp gear had good stats on it for the elemental spec do you have any idea how much you'd actually have to play to start getting purples?
---
Im not subbed and wont be till classic launch.
---
Patiently waiting for name reservation / server announce to sub. The only way I would play retail wow is if I was forced to under a gun honestly. Seeing the game in its current state just makes me want to gag honestly.
---
Yeah, I think he was mostly going off of Rorie's experiences in the Blizzcon demo. Sounds like Rorie hated BFA so much and thought Classic was just sort of boring.
---
Same pet but stable to tame other pets to learn abilities to teach your main
---
Do you think the inverse of that should apply? You don't think you'd be upset if resil was removed and the BiS weapon for your class had been a PvP specific weapon?
---
You sound stressed, man. If you need to vent to someone anonymous, shoot me a pm.
---
ACTIVISION will never openly admit classic wow sucesss.  it would invalidate everyrhing they've been pushing for in live wow.
---
Right, and because of that they should be treated differently. The main issue is that blizzard started to balance some talents and mechanics around arena game play; to me that's when it felt like homogenization started to take place (everyone needs a MS, a way to burst regen mana, a stun, escape method, etc.)
---
It's challenging to balance a game for two different completely play styles, but yeah nothing like those 35+ min barn burner 2s matches where you q up again afterwards only to run into the same matchup...
---
Look into macros, instead of hitting 3 buttons you can macro so 3 things happen with one button.  With that said retribution paladins have the least button mashing to do, a lot of the dps will be off auto attacks iirc.
---
&gt;I wouldn't mind seeing some of the class balancing lessons learned from later expacs make it into Classic with the understanding that the core gameplay should not change.
---
Sorry bud, nope.
---
Let the kids take 1 cookie on their own, they take 172.
---
That's horrifying. But nice words, friend. I hope you have a decent crew to play with when Classic hits. I'm "forced" to play on german realms.
---
I am thinking of using it just for the quest list, myself.
---
Wow. No idea how you can think that. Also, maybe you should at least give the opposing argument a listen. Maybe there’s a good point to it.
---
This. Shaman you’re gonna heal pve

While good 2-handers might be widely available, most of them are either world drops or boss drops you have to be lucky to get (unless you run a dungeon multiple times to get an upgrade).
---
From level 40 onward you can easily get your hands on two good 1-handers. [Sword of Omen](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6802/sword-of-omen) is available for Horde players who finish the Scarlet Monastery quest, and [Sword of Serenity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6829/sword-of-serenity) is the Alliance equivalent. For your second weapon, [Vanquisher's Sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10823/vanquishers-sword) is available to both factions from their respective RFD questlines. At 30DPS these weapons are strong at 40 and still worthwhile at 50. 
---
In the meantime you might be lucky and find various 1-hand drops from Zul'Farrak or Maraudon. Worst case scenario, you'll be able to upgrade your mainhand between level 48-50 with [Thrash Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade) from the Maraudon quest to kill Theradras, and that weapon is good enough to get you to 60.
---
I want to be able to find a raid group reliably but also be useful in my small questing group which may already contain a healer (Holy Paladin).
---
Go up a little further, the conversation was talking about exciting abilities, he just clarified that it’s fun but he finds it useless.  And once again, I understand what’s best and not best to do in bgs, but if I’m with my friend and we are having fun and I want to drop people off of cliffs, I’m going to do it.  Just like the majority of players who just play this game for fun and not just to win.  We. Aren’t. Discussing. Metas.
---
Stupidest shit ive read all day.
---
If you think dropping a profession is a waste, don't worry about making money at 60 then.
---
If you don't get rar enchants you don't make money... pretty simple.
---
Think I'll be doing both. I know warlock excels in both. Thing is my buddy who I will be playing with is going priest so I don't want to double up. I think I'd enjoy playing holy paly late game but how annoying is late game buff re-applying all the damn time?
---
I think it’s 50/50. That stun resist doesn’t go off 100% of the time.
---
First toon is going to be Gnome Warlock. I've never played one, I wanted to do a class that levels efficiently/easily because I wont have much time to play, and must be decent at world pvp, besides, they get a free mount. I know I want to make a rogue, so I'm going to level that one up around the time the BG phase comes out, and I'm going Dwarf because I like their racial best for pvp purposes. The question is, based on the staggered levelling, what professions should I do?  
---
Engineering will be a must for the Rogue, so he will probably just do mining and engineering entirely. Should the lock do tailoring so we have plenty of bags?
---
So you could have 12 hours of MEH? Nah I’d rather 1 hour of WOAH!
---
Is elv or tuk classicwow ready? Loved those.
---
You pay the same sub to play either though. Why would they care?
---
So disappointed they aren't removing DHKs
---
Such a useless mechanic that just discouraged/punished world pvp with no real benefit
---
Classic is only ~2 gb
---
Look at it from their perspective. Pushing new players towards Retail is much more valuable, because it is a purchased product and has micro-transactions. Additionally, Retail is by-and-large more accessible than Classic and is less likely to scare away / burn out new players. They are probably assuming that old player interested in Classic are still within Blizzard's general sphere of influence - engaging with industry news, streams, reddit, and such.
---
Yeah I have not time for that either
---
Alright. Thanks for the fantastic dialogue!
---
I guess your metaphor suggests negativity on my part. If you don't see the irony that you've actually been the one making up negative stats out of nowhere, without any sources or arguments behind it to cover your assumptions.
---
probably
---
Everyone loves mages and priests for groups. Still difficult to answer but there are usually plenty of healers. Can’t really go wrong with either. It comes down to how do you want to spend your SOLO time.
---
Exist and it is successful.
---
Barrens and barrens chat. I hope Chuck Norris makes his triumphant return to the meme world.
---
yeah right I sure loved 45 min arena fights
---
Do you know how often guilds would scalp people in pvp gear to fill empty slots because they were proficient?
---
Layering is going away by phase one. If enough people haven’t quit them they gotta make new servers. The ONLY reason for layering is congestion in the starting areas. That’s it.
---
I would stay away from tanking on a warrior. I pretty much mashed the heroic strike key the entire time I was taking damage (was usually rage-capped).
---
here I thought it was three total

Same here. Last subbed in '06.
---
No.
---
&gt; Let's do simple math! I buy game X for 60 bucks and season pass for year worth of content for 60 bucks. Now I paid 120 bucks for year worth of content. 
---
That you will get bored of in couple months. So, all of a sudden, you just spent $120 for 2 months, which is $60/month.
---
Unless you buy the new skin / weapon / ability / whatever, so you can actually compete in your game.
---
For instance, I bought the full FFXIV (before Shadowbringers) and paid 3 months upfront. Enjouyed it for about 6 weeks, got bored after 10 weeks (just under 3 months) but forced myself to play for 2 more weeks, so I won't feel that I wasted my money.
---
99% of the game out there are not providing even half the content Classic is, which makes them MORE EXPENSIVE and a waste of money.
---
I would rather pay twice the price to watch Star Wars original trilogy than pay half the price for all the other Star Wars combined.
---
Speak for yourself, I'm as hyped as ever.
---
I never thought of using Rank 1 Fireball that way.  Fuck that's smart.
---
Warrior did in TBC because of the amount of skills that were usable in defensive stance compared to Vanilla.  Vanilla was still a bit of carpal.  The reason being the spamming, positioning, and active playstyle.  I'd say healers with mods can basically lean back and stroke themselves while moving with the mouse buttons and clicking nonchalantly on healing frames.  DPS are a little more active but I wouldn't say they cause carpal tunnel.
---
i think that if anything blizzard wants to keep it on the dl because otherwise, Activision would be more involved.
---
maybe
---
I've aoe farmed on mage for years and still find it thrilling because its never a guarantee. Lightly put, shit happens. Mobs break out of cc early, or resist spells an unlucky amount of times... people link this to frustration, but its all part of the hunt.
---
Ironically, this was mostly a thing because of way too strong PvE loot making its way into arenas.
---
That's fine, yes shadowmeld is a useless but fun ability for Priest.
---
Most people find it more fun to be actively helping in the battle, but if your idea of fun is afking while invisible to each their own!
---
I do, but I'm scratching my head right now trying to figure out what you're getting at.
---
Absolutely, and it will crash and people will lose their name selection despite it "going through" the first time.
---
I will probably be questing, helping friends level and doing my professions too. Looking at tailoring and enchanting. I’m also torn between races. Gnome for Mage, Dwarf for Priest. Or if I go Horde, Troll.
---
It’s the same except instead of damage it’s healing.
---
How do they pay for that food
---
" Your guild will only ask you to tank, IF you have received a lot of tank gear. " how do you know his guild behaved that way?
---
" Your guild gave you that tank gear under the assumption that you would tank when needed." how do you know his guild behaved that way?
---
" If you don't want to tank for your guild, then don't accept tank gear. " how do you know he did accept any tank gear?
---
So besides the very first point, which is only informational, there is only assumptions build upon the previous assumptions.
---
Orgrimmar. I still get lost in new Org
---
Gnome mage. Mage sounds like the way to go
---
It’s pretty easy to setup gear score from bis lists though and I’m sure there will be addons etc :( let’s hope not but I’m sure there will be lfg etc as well in forms of addons or 3rd party sites
---
You cant use numbers you silly potato
---
I'll sub on August 27th
---
Druids can tank outside of 5 mans.
---
Because you believe it’s the better of the 2 when paired with a feral Druid for world pvp right?
---
You're just not meta enough.
---
Yeah, basically why anyone who says the patch fixed the game is a shrill.“ so your telling me grinding world quests... again fixedthe game”
---
Layering will make launch so smooth that people won't even think the game is very popular. Its going to be an epic double edged sword.
---
lol the average player does not roll priest, join a BG and go invinsible afk with shadowmeld.
---
In fact, I would say most AVERAGE players do not pvp at all. PVP in general tends to attract the more competitive and serious players.
---
Even the casual pvpers will be aware of the fact that sitting afk in shadowmeld and hoping for someone to come close enough to MC is a waste of time and not fun in any way.
---
hex is nice, but it doesn't proc blackout since it does no damage.
---
I don't know about the layering, only what they've stated publicly that it will strictly be a temporary solution. But, yes additional realms are ready to be fired up in case they are needed.
---
They will be creating the realm types (e.g. PVP, PVE, RP-PVP, RP-PVE) based on new user metrics, but they do have access to the old records to get an idea of what to expect. Much of it will be reactionary in the beginning, so they need to way several months before they determine the precise balance. They want to see what the tourists do first before making a decision.
---
The advanced 'name reservation plan will help a little bit in preparing equipment, but most of the work will happen post launch.
---
&gt; will not just stand next to their mate to get damaged with cleave/blade flurry If you attack their mate, they'll be in cat form behind you dishing out damage
---
Exactly, you will learn positioning or you will die in seconds.
---
&gt;If they or their partner gets low, they'll switch to caster form for a short time to get off a hot or even an instant heal
---
You will learn to read the druid movement and use abilities accordingly. Reading the movement of the other players is really important for a combat rogue in pvp, as they don't have the burst to end things quickly compared to the other specs, they rely a lof more on controling the fight.
---
For example a lot of people use blind at the start of the fight so they can 1vs1, but its better to save it when you want to finish the fight.
---
My tips won't work for good players trying to be the best (I'm was never one of the best as a rogue, I considered myself above average), but for an average player trying to get good.
---
If you're deadlast there's a reason.  Could be a number of reasons, but they all boil down to you are less important to raiding success than the folks ahead of you.  If those guys leave the guild doesn't really lose all that much.
---
It's fine to want to play casually,  but casual effort gets casual rewards

Shield Slam: This ability has received a redesign. It now costs 20 rage to use and the damage it does is modified by your shield block value. However, the base damage has been reduced. It generates more threat per rage and more damage per rage than it did previously.
---
I'm conflicted about playing as a Hunter...
---
I've been reading the subreddit for days looking through people's comments throughout different threads. I didn't start playing WoW until WoTLK and I've mained Paladin all throughout retail WoW, but with Classic im hoping to get a new taste into a different class to have as my primary. 
---
Ultimately, i'm a DPS kinda guy so i like going balls to the wall in terms of damage, and im more extremely interested in Hunter because according to research, in order to utilize the maximum amount of DPS in PvE content and preform well in raids you have to know the class like the back of your hand. I'm wanting to defy the odds of the typical "huntard" and be that guy people reach out to for content to do PVP/raids. My question is, is it really THAT hard that people make it out to be? i hear conflicting answers but it's so back and fourth that i'm not 100% clear with my decision yet. Do you guys think for the majority that are playing classic that used to play it will still have the same mindset towards hunters? and i'm assuming that the majority is not a fan of having them. 
---
Orc or Troll? for PvE and PvP? I've read up on the racials for each and it seems dead set.. i'm still torn, would love a 2nd opinion on this.
---
Shaman is only keeping me away because i know i ultimately have to sacrifice the A1 DPS to god like heals when it comes to raiding and that's a big ole' nope for me.
---
I would avoid playing video games till you fix your health

tukUI already has an apparently working [branch](https://git.tukui.org/Tukz/Tukui/tree/Classic) - [DL](https://git.tukui.org/Tukz/Tukui/-/archive/Classic/Tukui-Classic.zip)

elvUI is going to be available for classic but don't expect it to be out on release
---
&gt; Just a little update, yes there will be ElvUI for Classic. But don't expect it any time soon.  
---
[source](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=4282)

Layering is going to make for a very stable launch. It will also make you feel like your on a dead server a lot of the time. Fun... fun...
---
Are you going rogue again?
---
not at level 1 i bet
---
It‘s the Alliance equivalent of Zebra hooves.
---
There is 0 value in advertising this because nobody can buy it yet.
---
 I'm subscribed and I don't even know why. My account is on automatic 6 months renewal in hopes i'll get back to retail but i haven't logged in since January, I think. And before that maybe during the beginning of Legion. Kind of wanted to check out 8.2 but i feel bored even to think of it. But i decided that if Classic doesn't bring back my will to play video games, i'm actually cancelling my 13~14 years subscription and focussing on irl matters (not that are many, but still).
---
Man... no matter how many times I try to get into this game and no matter how many times I play it I just don't enjoy it. Which is sad because I loved Kotor 1 and 2. 
---
I feel like the gameplay is way too monotonous. It's talk to this person, go across this area to talk to the next person or kill this one person. Along the way you will run into mobs but like... the mobs just chill. They stand still and it seems like they have zero life outside of just waiting for me to come along and kill them. Contrast that with WoW where pretty much every mob has some kind of pathing cycle to them and makes it feel like they at least are doing something.
---
If the combat in that game was at all enjoyable it would be great because the story elements of the game are actually very enjoyable (looking at you Imperial Agent), but it just feels like I'm trying to skip over any and all combat to just get to the next story element.
---
You're right. Thanks for the correction!
---
No I heal these days, priest
---
You say that but twitch has evolved over the last few years with the advent of games like Fortnite and Hearthstone. 
---
The audience of Twitch is huge, and appeals towards a younger audience - who are prime for inviting into classic. Think of all the exposure the game will get from WoW streams surpassing Fortnite and IRL, people who are already invested into one video game are a lot easier to attract than people who no investment into video games.
---
It’s why Twitch as a platform is one of the best advertisement tools for video game companies. The point of advertisement and marketing generally isn’t to get someone to run out and immediately get your product - thats why most “As Seen on TV” products don’t do well. The point is to get someone who is in the market for an item to buy your brand or flavor.
---
Ideally at the end of launch week. Or before launch even happens.
---
Do people still watch cable tv?
---
I never played a Warlock in Vanilla but I'm already dreading any soul shard farming I'll have to do. And possibly getting eaten by rogues?
---
A bit of a different twist on the question. I'm maining a human warrior like I did in classic. 
---
What is different is that I recently bought a G600 and went on a pserver went and from being a clicker to button binds and macros for every ability.  It was awful at first but after 10 hours played I can even pvp relatively effectively and feel I'm getting better all the time.
---
I use the 12 mouse buttons + shift modifier scroll wheel up and down and the extra button on top of the mouse below the wheel giving me 27 keybinds.
---
My question, what alliance class should I roll as my alt that will easily use only the 27 keybinds I'm comfortable with? I will level professions (probably alchy/herb to support my warrior), pvp a decent amount and probably jump in raids as an alt as needed. I have experience using every class on Alliance but can't figure this alt out. I'd like it to be a ranged dps to give myself a break from the constant kiting I'll be fighting on my warrior. Mage/lock/hunter? 
---
Help!
---
Cool to know! I guess its something to look out for on my horde alts.
---
Get an autoclicker and play frost mage in pve (:
---
Eh, I'm okay with some amount of layering tbh, my problem is just it lasting too long.
---
That is a lot of time for food.
---
Yea GW1 was great. I remember when I played it waaaaay back when, I actually really didn't like the choosing of skills. I wanted it to be like WoW and allow me to use everything in my toolkit. Looking back now, I can see that it did lead to some very interesting choices.
---
And yea. GW2 made me feel nothing except a longing to replay GW1.
---
They already said only people who had it then can get it now.........
---
I love Chinese food and you never see advertisements on television for Chinese food yet i buy it often and it is delicious. Sometimes word of mouth is better for some things.
---
I don't think that's true. There was still plenty of world pvp in BC/Wrath. 
---
Also some of the most fun I had was knocking people off their mounts in storm peaks back when knockback spells dismounted people. /lol
---
The thing is you have to design zones around flying. BC/Wrath zones felt huge. Then they changed their zone design philosophy around making these really dense zones and it no longer worked with flying.
---
This. There's really not much money in it other than strengthening sub numbers. They cant monetize it, and i think naturally they don't want to swing attention away from the major cash cow, just notice it like more of an added feature. My shiny metal hat also tells me that's the reason they didn't add a specific button for wow classic on the launcher but rather a drop down menu so easily missed.
---
True but that still doesn't make it a good idea. Having a list of bullet points doesn't guarantee success and I'm 100% sure everyone will abandon the game, except maybe for the ultra casual players. Also wow mobile would have to compete with diablo immortal. They're both mobile fantasy rpgs all about looting gear and killing demons. Blizz moving the game to mobile would mean most of their players ditching the game for good and also cannibalizing their other mobile game.
---
one last point - open world doesn't work well on mobile and the game's size is massive even if it is severely downscaled. The game's engine is fairly old and I'm not sure how well it will work on mobile. Also who the fuck would want a 30gig game on their phone?
---
Azshara. I absolutely loved that zone in Vanilla, and hate what they did to it in Cataclysm. It was such a beautiful zone that always felt mysterious. It was gorgeous, yet dangerous. I battled Azuregos there many times. There was a placeholder dark portal underwater there back in the day. My favorite zone back in the day, with Winterspring a close second.
---
there is a button for pugs ITS CALLED NEED
---
It's perfectly fine tanking with two-handers while levelling. You have to be in agreement with the healer about it though.
---
Yeah, punctuation really does help.
---
They could easily make more than 5 layers.
---
Lets says they made 20 layers and for some reason, they all retained max population numbers and layering has a 4 weeks timespan.
---
After 2 weeks you merge half the layers doubling the population of the remaining 10 layers, enable the login queue and offer everyone free transfer. Wait one week and do it again, this time you end up with 5 layers and a full server when the transfers are complete.
---
The is an extreme example they probably have limits to prevent population reaching 4 times the desired number, but it wouldn't be impossible to balance the population.
---
... except to create your character. You act like ppl won’t sub for that, like they don’t know they will, but they will and they do.
---

You dont look stupid on a kodo bro. Kodos are some of are best friends and they always get us to are destination safley. Yeah so what if their running animation is weird as fuck.  They never complain when we jump on them and they make funny noises when we summon them.
---
Dont forget drinking white can monster
---
yeah? what's your point? it's still a reason to subscribe before release
---
Yes. Both are great classes
---
If you're NA and looking to go Horde, you're always welcome to to join up with my group. We're planning to clear all raid content but also will be recruiting PvPers and casual players for a well rounded atmosphere. Most of us are former Mythic raiders from retail so there's definitely a lot of experience.
---
My advice would be to either go Hunter or Paladin.
---
Beastmaster Hunter can pretty much just auto-attack while the pet does most of the work. It's also a fairly efficient spec so you'll level quickly.
---
Paladin is basically the "press two buttons then auto attack" class. It's incredibly slow paced and takes ages to level, but it won't really put any strain onto your arms.
---
Some of the caster classes might be a good fit as well, but most of them will involve you spamming one or two buttons constantly so that might be an issue.
---
It should be like EQ. Which was/is an amazing game.
---
Thanks Obama
---
Sel raid consumes at 300 and profit. That’s all you need to know about alchemy for making money. Sell elixir of the mongoose and you’ll make money faster than you could ever spend it.
---
That's interesting, thanks for sharing
---
There's a sticky post on Mondays for recruiting guilds. Would be a good place to start.
---
While Paladins are very open to interrupts, cc is less of an issue if you use Blessing of Sacrifice timely.
---
I dont think you could go wrong with either, but if you want to be your warrior's support swiss army knife, you'd be best off with the paladin
---
In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings
---
Yep, if my name is taken I can figure out a new one. Not a big deal to me.
---
To be fair, I'm extremely high iq. I remember I managed to sexually assault my Dad and talk my way out of trouble.
---
Just give me my class cannon stats fuck an ilvl.
---
I don't know anything about wow radio. Is there somewhere I can go listen to old broadcasts? It would be cool to go back and listen to them talk about the game so long ago when it was live.
---
I'll save my money for actual gametime.  If I have to name myself captaindanglyballz instead of captaindanglyballs I'll somehow survive.
---
Who wastes that much time for food? Just quickly pick up something and eat it while grinding.
---
Wasting all that coke and redbull before classic drop? Amateur mistake.
---
I'm thinking my main will be an undead or orc warlock. The stun resist is the only thing that pulls me to orc, so I have more of a chance against jerk rogues in wpvp. But I don't know what difference to really expect it to make. Anyone have numbers on this that give an idea of how many fights i should even expect this to help with?
---
you are behind the times friend it was delayed some time ago
---
Rofl
---
Tailoring + enchanting maybe. Could craft gear for your lock and enchants for your rogue.
---
I'm not saying this is necessarily my exact thoughts, but there is an argument to be made that the best gear should be obtained by killing dragons (or whatever other big baddies) that hoard these epic items, and not what Joe Vendor has stashed in the back of his storeroom.  I totally understand the game play reasons for PvP vendors and gear quality, but as far as immersion is concerned, PvP gear being anything even close to raid gear makes no sense.
---
"I saved all of Outland when I killed Illidan and got this awesome sword!"
---
"I beat up some guys in an arena and some dude just gave me this awesome sword!"
---
Again, I totally understand the game play reasons for this not being the case, but which sword do you think should be better in an MMO?
---
Yeah, in legion. Not that much in bfa
---
Can you explain the joke?
---
These people man... how is it not a valid data point?
---
No, that'd just force people who have a new battle net account to play with the zoomers
---
Ret paladin.
---
You basically only use something each 20 seconds. Problem is you can start a masturbating problem.
---
Is there an internal cd to how often shadowguard pops?
---
Un Goro Crater, Tanaris, Mulgore!!
---
You’d also have to select a realm presumably. We may not know what realm the streamers will select (in order to avoid those ) until shortly afterwards. Might make sense to wait a day or two after August 13
---
Warrior is 1 through 10. Rogue is 11, followed by feral druid. Then all other DPS, then healers.
---
I want Vanilla, not BC. I won't pay for a game I don't enjoy.
---
Sick reference, bro!
---
I also believe. Trump was elected because he's a meme lord and storm area 51 started as a meme... Memes are the future!
---
There literally is a gold value on playing with that drop though. It's BoE, go buy it for market price.  
---
Obviously you can't replace item drops with bags of gold because then what items would you buy with that gold?
---
I got carpal tunnel in BFA from raiding with Fury Warrior
---
Let's say I have a flight on the 18th. I won't go to the airport on the 11th.
---
Have you ever played an MMORPG that had no auctions house, and the trading was made in main cities?
---
You most likely DID NOT.
---
I did...and while it is nice to haggle with people, it was a fucking NIGHTMARE.
---
You couldn't see any fucking NPC. There were THOUSANDS of people crammed into the main city plaza...because, well, it was the closest to city entrance and the place where everyone would gather.
---
Sure, in THEORY, it sounds really RPG-ish, and I personally like the idea...unless I haven't lived it.
---
Could this idea work in a Classic+ expansion? Yes, but NOT by replacing the AH. 
---
It could work, as an ALTERNATIVE to AH. You could have a TRADING hub in Classic+, where there is NO tax for sales, but it will have to be a HARD limit on how many items you can post. Like 8 or 10 items, max, on a table in front of your character. And you will have to be ONLINE for your table to show up for other players.
---
It won't replace the AH, it will have a limited use in exchange for no tax sales, but it will require you to be online.
---
Replacing the AH would be EXTREMELY dumb.
---
I remember way back when, reaching Arathi Highlands and being bewildered by the high level players queuing for AB. I was challenged to a duel by a mage of a similar level to me.  He frost bolt kited me to oblivion. I didnt know what I could possibly do against it. At that point a naked level 60 warrior started to explain what I ought to do... I.e. Switch zerker and intercept, use pummel,  go d stance when being kited etc... To his astonishment I explained I didn't have these abilities, I didnt have these "stances"... I had somehow managed to miss all the warrior quests.   After backtracking I entered a dungeon as a 'tank', no idea what I was meant to be doing... The group swiftly noticed and commented on my bizzare stance dancing. Until I was told... Wear a shield, stay in defensive stance and use sunder armour... A valuable lesson not quite learned at the time. It was a very long and painful process of not knowing if I was doing it right. I ended up as an off tank all through ZG, MC and even Bwl (somehow).
---
I'm like to add some tips for new tanks. When tanking UBRS there will be pulls whit over 5x mobs so to make things smooth remember to stack up all mobs this includes the Off tank mobs too to One BIG pack. Rogues, warriors and other DPS have so high damage abilities that will deal damage to all close by mobs. Because of this remember to move the mobs away from CC (sheep, traps... etc.) 
---
This will Make the run much faster rather then kill them One by One.
---
Which is kind of funny because the only other significant subscription-based mmo on the market in the same class as WoW is FFXIV, with slower questing, a required main story, and a longer GCD.
---
It's a chronic thing. I think it could be okay, just playing in moderation. Thanks for the real answer though.
---
Fighting over summon stones was some of my favorite world pvp. Small skirmishes with a clear goal both teams are fighting for.
---
Not to forget the fact that they could have aimed to launch during the summer when the older customer base might have had more time to play the game. Know myself and lots of friends are going to have a minimal amount of time come late August, but would have played the shit out of it if it had released late July. Would also comment on the Tuesday release, but that just seems to be a Blizzard thing historically
---
What is Goblin and Gnomish Engineering?
---
2
---
Can easily be made into an addon. Manually assigning scores for gear for different classes/specs
---
Maybe I'm just not hardcore enough these days.
---
I think almost any class should be fine in PvE as long as you don't spam-click your keys. A lot of players spam the button as it's about to come off cooldown, if not for that I don't think any class in classic should cause issues. 
---
You can more easily avoid spamming like that with some classes though. Hunter comes to mind (in PvE).
---
So, I'm happy to have a conversation and disagree but I'm not gonna feel bad for proposing it.
---
Here is the list of things I care about from Classic:
---
1. Sense of Community: sharding and the group finder are probably my single biggest issue with retail.
---
2. Class Identity: Everyone feels unique and can do different things (Note: I don't feel like what I've proposed above **necessarily* contracticts this point. Every class as at least one damage spec, but they still manage to be unique). 
---
3. A product of love: I'm sure many people here own and have read the Warcraft Diary. Part of what makes Classic amazing is the time and love that went into developing this, at great personal expense to the developers themselves. 
---
4. The depth of character itemization and the importance of specific gear: Mechanics that were eventually gutted, like crushing blows and critical hits from bosses which required Defense to mitigate, as well as hit rate for DPS classes have contributed towards the abysmal homogenization of retail. Not to mention more specific raid requirements like resistance gear.
---
5. World Size: Adding flying and world mobility creep makes retail feel small and elimantes the sense of grandeur that came with Classic. 
---
6. Meanginful Faction differences: Having pally/shaman be faction unique was a very cool way to create entirely different gameplay experiences for each faction. 
---
I can go on and on with reasons to love Classic like how reputation grinds feel meaningful, the AQ opening event, leveling feels meaningful and **ding** is worth celebrating. I don't really know how I could really capture everything. That being said, I don't feel like **every** aspect of classic is flawless. Where to draw the line is obviously important and as a consequence I absolutely respect the position of **NO CHANGE**. It's a valid argument and I will never try to make the case that I'm right and someone else is wrong. I don't want to see Blizzard's idea of new content. I don't want to see Classic get homogenized into retail. But I do want to be able to be a main tank at some point without being forced to play a Warrior. If I don't get that, that's **okay**. But I won't play a Warrior and I'm not gonna try to make something work that simply doesn't.
---
Berserking costs mana?
---
Yeah well you are very ignorant to just how bad the average player is my friend.
---
For example, I’ll use arenas.  What would you say the average rating is for people who do arenas on a regular basis during tbc or wotlk?  The average player doesn’t even understand they need to kick spells.  The average player doesn’t understand you need to cc healers.  To get challenger in tbc all you needed was like a 1400-1500 rating and this means you are top 30% of players.
---
Get a friend and duo level.  
---
Then they are one of the best combos.
---
jesus, can't you all just read my comment properly?
---
I do know that, as I was in the beta and hauled ass to Silithus to see if the questgivers and FP were there. The FP is there, questgivers at Cenarion Hold are absent
---
I reactivated after many years last week. I built a monster computer to play classic. I have Been leveling a Priest to get used to playing again.
---
They are shunning the classical pc gaming market in favor of mobile and microtransaction based games.
---
I played druid for 2 years from start of MC to killing KT, I was one of the two druids that regularly showed up so I ended up with literally all the offspec gear in the game. I had my healer gear, my pure +heal gear, bear tank gear, cat dps gear, feral pvp gear, caster pvp gear, shadow resist set and a ton of other meme items. Bankspace was a real chore but I was respecing like 2-4 times a week to try every aspect of druid, its what I made one for.
---
Feral pvp in every single aspect does not work whatsoever. I don't care if you link me a video with some guy meleeing some chinamen 1v3 or something its just not good vs anyone who is paying attention or knows how to press buttons. It does not matter what spec you are or what gear you are wearing if your idea of feral pvp is doing damage primarily by shifting into forms to melee its not going to work. To give you a perspective of just how bad feral pvp is : you go from handing mages a noose because there is absolutely nothing they can do to a caster / resto druid to actually struggling to even damage them. A mage can kite you so easily if you are feral its not even funny, then you oom by shifting or casting 1 heal while he is bashed. I'm not even going to talk about warlocks or other casters and if you are meleeing a warrior / rogue it doesnt matter if you are in bearform with feral spec you will die because they are pure melee classes and you are not. No amount of hybrid feral meme spec is going to fix the fact that just putting on even the simplest of int+stam gear and having a deep balance+ns spec is always going to be better and safer.
---
HOTW spec is no different, you just have more mana before you oom and die to the same things that made normal feral pvp not work. You either go full pve feral for pve with full consumes and pummelers or you dont bother at all. I'm all for having fun and not taking raiding super seriously because lets face it vanilla raiding is not hard at all but being some meme hybrid spec in raids is just awful not just to the people who are carrying you essentially but for yourself too because you will just be performing lackluster at the very best.
---
If you want to be a feral in pve focus entirely on the pve side and collect caster pvp gear for pvp. Caster druid with deep balance and natures swiftness build is pretty close to warlock tier when it comes to 1v1 potential, there are very few matchups you are disadvantaged in and even then you can just run away and evade your attacker if you want to at any time.
---
I always tell myself I'll just rotate to keep leveling on rested xp, but then get in the zone and level my favorite
---
just 2 more levels to the next ability unlock!
---
one more point and I can get the next level skill tree...
---
&gt; Maybe. Druids, for SURE. But Paladins? Nope, because Alliance gets 3 tanks, and making Shamans tank...that will fuck up the entire Classic+.
---
Excellent point.
---
Youch....I was out of town the 18th-19th and though I missed it and then was stoked it was the 25-26th. Alas...
---
Oh, you sweet summer child.
---
You got fucked by them tho, you know you did.
---
Sure are reaching for an argument aren't ya?
---
423,965
---
"criminals".... You're a fool sir
---
Roll hunter and you can program your Logitech gaming mouse/keyboard to do your rotation for you 😂
---
My guess is CPU, but if you haven't overclocked the CPU at all, I'd start there. With an OC, I'd guess you'll then be more GPU-limited in a busy raid environment.
---
2 hours a day I would say is unreasonable. That seems like bad planning or you're feeding a family.
---
Yeah and where did I say SUB NOW? I just gave him 2 reasons to resub before launch.
---
Exist.
---
Poppycock.  Serious Hunter raider here and the only thing that comes from Engi that you absolutely must have is the ammo - and you can get a guildy or friend to craft that for you.
---
I feel like Classic really needs its own Twitch category, instead of being lumped into the retail one.
---
I just bought a 6 month sub to make a statement to Blizzard on just how much I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
&gt; So you just straight up think that warcraft lore is garbage
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; yes
---
If you play Vanilla and hate the lore why should you anyone care that you hate TBC's lore too?
---
I like to say that Elemental shaman combine the mana inefficiency of shadow bolt, the poor scaling of frost bolt, and the lack of sustain of a boomkin. Seriously the worst pve class in the game bar-none.
---
Retail and FFXIV
---
On a laptop. I agree.  It would take a lot of shopping around and it would be used. Not quite as hard for a desktop though that presents other problems. 
---
if you intend to use the igpu I strongly recommend the amd Radeon Vega chips for this price bracket.
---
Plan to subscribe in August in time for character creation.
---
Acti-Blizz's stock has already tanked. They're hoping and praying that CoD Modern Warfare pulls them back out of irrelevance. Hopefully Classic can do the same for the Blizzard side of the house.
---
Regardless, it's not a healthy company at the moment.
---
You know you can trade other players right?
---
Ok
---
Nope, modern server technology will allow for cloud scaling to allocate resources as needed. This can be done in a matter of seconds to handle high volume of traffic if they don’t have the resources.  Also I imagine the stress test has allowed them to evaluate how much each server can take. I think they are more ready for this than people think. Better technology and faster internet. Or maybe I just don’t want to give my hopes up.
---
Slay the Spire, also the perfect game to play while playing WoW! On Flight Paths, crafting, etc
---
You have a 30% chance to resist stuns each time. So if you’re stunned:
---
1 time in a fight your odds of resisting it is 30%
---
2 times, the odds of you resisting at least once is 51%
---
3 times, the odds if you resisting at least once is 65.7%
---
4 times ... 76%
---
5 times ... 83.1%
---
Mage or Hunter are solid, though I'm skeptical that the "front line fighting" will still be a thing, where having that huge range makes you a veritable untouchable howitzer, able to single-handedly push back the entire enemy lines.
---
Even at the end of Vanilla, with the AV changes, folks were already merely riding past one another and only honor farming instead of fighting one another. Private Servers held fast to that same mentality, except even moreso. But if you like the idea of nuking people then you'll be fine with Hunter or Mage in BGs. They're both at the top in the ablity to aoe snare entire teams of enemies, great for WSG flag protection &amp; attack.
---
i learned it as to be decided
---
Can't you play for free all the way up to 20? I might just wait until I get to the point to resub, no sense spending money any sooner than I have to.
---
You got any examples?
---
Just watched 22 jump street... so my first reaction to reading Brad McQuaid was thinking of Channing Tatum's character lol
---
Me as well, just hit level 25 on my undead warrior. Never tanked in my life but just ran WC for the first time and it was so much fun but man classic is brutal to warriors.
---
I love it.
---
They really only need to launch seasonal servers, and the game would stay alive for a long time. It would be so cool if they also did the same thing with TBC and Wrath for example (and later expansions too, sure). There would always be something "fresh" to play on.
---
Murloc RPG 1 and 2 ofc :D
---
I used it as an example my dude.  If anything the arena players would be considered more ‘hardcore’ of a player because you have to go out of your way to make a team and get your team together.  bgs  you just q and that’s it.  Way more casual.
---
And you can make all the stuff up you want.  No one said they are afking all game but you.  I simply said they are just playing the game for fun and don’t care about strategies like they can’t defend a flag as a priest.  Also if you truly believe the AVERAGE player who is joining a bg understands these ‘rules’ you’re simply just ignorant.  Which is pretty adorable imo that you truly believe people are honestly that competent.  I’m guessing you have either A: haven’t been in a bg in a very long time or B: you just do premades and haven’t pugd in a long time.  There’s a reason premades stomp pugs my dude.  It’s because the average player doesn’t follow these strats/rules.
---
Agreed. Troll or Tauren is much better than orc if you plan to play elemental. Orc is only good for enhance and the 25% resist is overhyped as you will most likely use a pvp trinket at 60 to remove stuns. I have never had a problem with rogues as a troll ele shaman, they are one of the easiest classes to kill 1v1 tbh as ele.
---
But the serious raider just disagreed..
---
Just get Ravager... You can definitely get away with only axes while leveling. 
---
But the real question is whether fury or arms is better for leveling early on.  I think Fury wins until you get sweeping strikes.
---
Same, been subbed since vanilla although my OG account was banned for botting during late BC or WOTLK so I didn't get beta. I've still spent less than $0.25 per hour played, great value. I'd be more than happy to pay more.
---
&gt; The Charred Vale 
---
One of my favorite spots sub 30. Not a ton of other people, but lots of Harpies who drop feathers and cloth. Every now and then you'll spot something through the trees... was that a player? Be on your toes!
---
It’s already implemented. The update that is most required is opinion and community awareness. Not sure blizz much about that.
---
But yes, if we could update pals and druids to tbc that would be great.
---
Also any news on the open stress test thingie?
---
I cut down on food and sleep in equal parts.
---
Phase 1 will not be including PvP gear afaik.
---
My notes are at home but I believe the Prot set I am chasing is   [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/ATwBQVcCQpQDLXAFM3AGORwHQVgIOR0JRTIKNCALLZUMMP8NLiIOMoIPLWcQMfoRM7s](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/ATwBQVcCQpQDLXAFM3AGORwHQVgIOR0JRTIKNCALLZUMMP8NLiIOMoIPLWcQMfoRM7s). I am mostly questioning if I am thinking of the right bracers/neck. Weapons for single target would be aiming to be something like   [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/ATwBQVcCQpQDLXAFM3AGORwHQVgIOR0JRTIKNCALLZUMMP8NLiIOMoIPLWcQM5QRRTY](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/ATwBQVcCQpQDLXAFM3AGORwHQVgIOR0JRTIKNCALLZUMMP8NLiIOMoIPLWcQM5QRRTY) 
---
This is for tanking non raid bosses though(possibly raid trash). Without Taunt or good Tier sets I do not imagine raid tanking as Prot would be much fun to me. If you are looking to Raid Tank, you will still need a heavy focus on generating threat like the above items, but add in a lot more Defense items like  [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)  recommends for Prot Paladins.
---
Just to add: I thank you for sharing but I really don't think I trust his results. He is essentially saying that 1% crit is worth more than 28 AP which is far more than rogue and warriors value it, and rogue and warriors has increased crit damage. Obviously the extra combo point has a value too but I don't believe it's this high. Also he says his soft crit cap is 54.4% - miss chance. With 9% hit for yellow hit cap which i assume he only goes for. That gives him a crit cap of 41.4% which is fairly easily achieved with worldbuffs and decent gear alone.
---
Well, you didn't miss it. xD
---
Honestly I would rather ya have less coverage if it means less meddling hands.
---
And you can only /w people withing 1 yard.
---
Not sure if it will be the same in classic, but in vanilla the push from 50 to 60 is when I usually abandoned dungeons.  
---
Blackrock Mountain and Swamp of Sorrows weren't great leveling/grinding zones and I hated traveling to them only to have the group fall apart, so I would grind out 50-60 in UnGoro, EPL, WPL, Felwood and Winterspring.  Then as a fresh 60, I'd shift my focus back to dungeons.
---
Mordhau, Darkest Dungeon, Crusader Kings 2, Squad
---
Okay again, now you are just rambling on about something entirely unrelated to the point you were trying to make.
---
NE is the worst priest race in the game, shadowmeld is a fun but useless ability in pvp for a priest, and it does not improve the or spice up the shadow priest rotation in any way.
---
No amount of incoherent rambling is going to change that.
---
Wow, what a load of elitist nonsense.  Outside of ammo, Engi might help you contribute a fraction of a % more dmg .  Other than the top top progression guilds going for world firsts, that just doesnt matter.
---
You go shopping like once a week, that takes like 50 minutes for me personally including the travel. I cook my meals daily, sometimes I'll do enough for it to last for two meals (like when I do homemade pizza). Even with making the dough from scratch(shit, this is even includes creating my own garlic sauce for the pizza) it takes around 60 minutes for it to be prepared and ready to eat. Takes like 5-10min to eat, and I could do that while gaming as well.
---
And 10 serverings of spaghetti would take like 15 minutes to cook, 45 minutes? You actually dont cook food, do you? You have absolutely no perspective on how long it takes to cook and prepare food.
---
LBRS is a great one to chain run a couple times at 55 it has some common loot that is quite good that alot of people tend to skip over, plus if your doing LBRS you will get your Seal of Ascension don't super early and can start tanking UBRS with your own key right as you hit 60.
---
Dude Divinity OS2 is freaking rad. Totally recommend. You’ll get a damn good month out of that game while you wait for classic. Should be more enough time for a play through or two, and you’ll likely want to play some more whenever you get bored
---
Its not the TBC lore, its the rediculous enviorments in spaaaaaace and the atrocious neon armor designs.
---
How will they have egg on their face? If what you say comes to pass, then they become super rich without needing to spend a single dollar on advertising.
---
&gt;They genuinely believe they have their pulse on the market, they think people enjoy the skinner box loot mill mmorpg.
---
Surely some pople do seeing how many skinner boxes loot mill mmorpgs there are on the market now?
---
Gonna sub when it releases, I generally have no interest in blizzard games currently.
---
Damn casual 😂
---
That reminds me how if you put something on the curb with "free" on it, and nobody takes it, put a sign that says "$30" on it. It'll disappear overnight.
---
It's completely different, but I think it's part of that same mindset in some people.
---
Full realms were when they reached the population cap was 50.000 active accounts, only counting accounts that had logged in within the last 30 days.
---
I mean, what if 500k people try to make names, and most of those people speak English fluently. As original as want to be, there will be lots of overlap because most of our 'originality' did not start with us as individuals.
---
How many raptors do I have to kill until the stolen silver drops?
---
Maybe a tinfoilhat conspiracy, but maybe Blizz is keeping this lowkey so Activision doesn't try to get it's fingers in the mix and ruin everything.
---
It's so sad when people consider sacrificing their health to play video games, while the real healthy solution is so close.
---
No fucking shit I never said nightelf spices up the rotation I said it has exciting abilities for randoms who just play the game for fun.  There’s no way you’re actually reading my posts, if you have you’re honestly the dumbest person I’ve talked to in a while
---
It pretty much writes itself. New era vs old. I can picture a character talking about going back to the dark ages.
---
It certainly feels like Blizzard is begrudgingly releasing Classic, at least at some levels of their organization.
---
I also prefer arms. But I do think if you only pve and never pvp, fury levels faster untill sweeping strikes at least. Even then, flurry is very strong.  5% crit is very good first talent compared to 5 parry. Tactical Mastery is more pvp/ tanking. Rafe gen between unbrudled wrath and anger management is comparable. Piercing Howl and Enrage are better than deep wounds and impale.
---
To be fair, I seem to remember one thing players demanding frequently on the forums was for thousand needles to be flooded
---
If you need to sleep 7-8 hours, that work must be like 18. Must suck to be a slave.
---
Sure, if you have ~150g spare for both pieces.  Otherwise, keeping LW/Sk allows you to farm the mats solo as a hunter.
---
I don't think thats true. There aren't that many people that buy those things compared to expansions, where everyone buys it.
---
&gt;[Question] How should I play [Insert Class Here] with Melee Leeway being what it is?
---
uh... literally how you played it in Vanilla?
---
They are and they aren't. They're basically the same genetically (no significant differences unlike the high elves contrasted with the Highborne). That said, they do have a split based around whether or not they feed their mana addiciton or whether or not they choose to abstain. High elves are **very, very** few in number and are technically part of the alliance, albeit, not as playable characters. Their status is closer to the reputations that are allied with a particular faction.
---
Tier 2 paladin... is it worth not DPSing? *Time will tell.*
---
Okay, the original comment you replied to was talking about what races spice up the shadow priest rotation since it's kind of basic.
---
So it seems you have missed the point right out of the gate, and are continuing to slowly spiral into incoherent rambling that continues to miss the point.
---
I cook all my food if you can't make sauce and meatballs in 15 mins.  You can boil noodles in 15 mins which tells me you're using some prego bullshit probably boiled with ground beef.  You disgust me.
---
we had AQ40 pugs on our pserver...
---
common catch the dragon
---
You can't use the engineering items without knowing the profession and proper crafting level
---
You can talk to and ginvite everyone on the server even if they're on a different layer. The algorithm will then try to have guildies on the same layer automatically.
---
You say that like Thelsamar isn't next to the badlands and closer to Uldaman than Kargath already.
---
Glass City Cannons
---
When I first started, PvE. Made sense as I was brand new to both MMORPGs and WoW. This time, definitely PvP.
---
Why would they sink marketing into a game thats not being sold in stores?
---
I’m rolling, among other things, a night elf druid. Gonna try and be as flexible as possible, mainly feral talents but getting gear to fill more roles. I was thinking of levelling with mining and skinning, later getting enchanting for smoking heart of the mountain, but is it better to get enchanting right away? I understand alliance is somewhat better than horde for feral druids, but is the difference negligible?
---
If you play on a PvE realm, you’re not playing classic.
---
I want to play DPS but I was worried that not being able to fill tank/heal would make group-finding difficult.  
---
But after thinking about I think it's nothing to worry about. It will be harder than if I played tank/healer, but there's no better time to level a DPS than right at the beginning. There is going to be more dungeon groups forming while people are all leveling. If I ever want to fill those roles I'll be fine no matter when I do it, but the level zerg only happens once.
---
I saw they gave me 3 days free time (I think because of 8.2). Going to use that for character creation then use all my retail gold to but play time
---
This isn't even a joke, so many people are terrible with their time management that it may appear as if they have no time for private stuff.
---
You really need 1 addon for every class ever
---
Snowfall keypress - makes a spell or ability trigger upon pressing a hotkey rather than on release of the hotkey.. adds like 0.25 seconds to your average hotkey mashing prowess.. MUST HAVE FOR EVERY PLAYER
---
In Warcraft 3 lore Arthas crushed Silvermoon tho. They retconned it in TBC so he only crushed part of it and somehow many survived.
---
Moon fire spam, shifting between forms, rejuv, etc.
---
Memekin is not a good choice for carpal tunnel. Druids need to be doing a lotnfo clicking in between dropping starfire spam.
---
Not subbed, will sub a month out (prep some of my addons, and be ready for name res)  
---
Last sub, end of MoP.
---
Forget imp. As a former warlock main, gimmick builds like this don’t work. You’re better off going SM/Ruin or Conflag and running with a felhunter and a couple limited invuln/living action pots on you.
---
There are items from gnomish and goblin that only require engineering level not spec specific and are bop.  Only a couple require the actual ‘required gnomish’ items and they aren’t that great.
---
Probably with a keyboard and mouse.
---
Same here... Old Darkshore has that mysterious gloomy vibe full of ancient spirits. I will probably play hide because of friends but I will sit make an night elf Ally only to do the night elf zones.
---
It's different than private servers, and from everything I've heard, the guides that say to use it are useless.
---
It may not be different from Vanilla, but it's different from all of the recent resources.
---
Also everyone has their mounts.
---
Waiting for August 13th.
---
IMO the fem models have better animations throughout the alliance. Human male casting looks like they're literally hunched over and grabbing the spell out of their purse. Female animations looks more like they're summoning the power need to cast the spell. Same pattern for NE except instead of grabbing out of a purse, the Males are grabbing it out of their heads.
---
Also food, gotta love that Adderall diet. Amphetamines really are the solution to this problem
---
At some point it could have been 50k, but blizz's definition of "full" has fluctuated
---
Get my friends to play with me.
---
I dont really see how 12 stam is better than 6 AP for a hunter that can feign death.
---
But there will be many melee who want zulian tigerhide for threat.  So imo, this is a cloak that lasts a tank quite sometime. It can also fit into resist sets.
---
Updating gearscore to work in Vanilla wouldn't be hard at all. Anyone that would care about your gearscore though, can already simply look at your character and know how geared you are.
---
I know I can glance at basically any character in Vanilla and accurately estimate their gear "value".
---
How does paladin scale with gear? I really like warrior because I can so easily notice how much better the warrior becomes with better gear. Does the same apply to the paladin class? I do prefer being a support class so that is why I was thinking paladin. Also because I like mail/plate over cloth. Leather is okay.
---
Just commenting to show off my flair 🤗
---
Hunter.  2/3 of your DPS is based on you sending in your pet and auto-shotting.  The last 1/3 of your DPS comes from using your abilities.  So you can click 2 buttons per fight and basically be at 67% damage potential.
---
People that sub for BFA are more profitable than those that will sub for Classic only. A migration of the playerbase to Classic is a loss of money. They really only want new/returning subs for Classic.
---
Link your weapons for me to check
---
Yeah I understand, many share your sentiments about that so I can understand. Blizz can come off as a greedy Corp sometimes. People are calculating that it’s an “extra” $6.50, but honestly it’s only two weeks of a difference. You’re gonna get billed for a month either way September 12th or September 26th, or whenever. In the scheme of things it’s the price of a cheeseburger, some fries and a soda. Some people don’t take issue with that. 
---
Regardless, we’re all very excited! See you in Azeroth soon!
---
This is why I mostly play single player these days. I really dislike the elitist kids who expect me to be able to play 14 hours a day, staying up until 8am
---
Man.... For the first time I'm motivated to do some cardio workouts
---
Should a drop-down menu above the “play” button for retail. AFAIK NA accounts got the download for classic but not other regions.
---
So your argument essentially comes to the point that you want what you want, and damn the consequences for anybody and everybody else?  If Blizzard entertains idea for making tankadins raid viable then they have no excuse for not doing the same for other meme specs. You claim you don't want to the classes to be homogenized like retail,  while at the same time advocating for a change that would be a very big stepping stone towards that happening. Very hypocritical.
---
If you role Warlock at the beginning, there will be so many groups forming for dungeons that finding a DPS slot won't be very hard. Obviously not as easy as tank/heals, but not bad at all. No better time to role DPS than at the beginning IMO.
---
With a very good raid group you should be in melee as a warlock and attack the boss w/shadow oil on a 1.5 wep speed when GCD is triggered this could do 700damage. Its extreme min-max but regardless its a solution.
---
I've never played classic before and have only played the end of legion and some of bfa but my buds and I are wanting to play some classic. We have some DPS, a tank but no heals. I've never healed and wanted to try it out but I'm looking to do some damage at the same time, so half heal half dps. I want to heal my group through leveling and dungeons but raiding I'd much rather dps as I feel more comfortable doing so. I play alliance and up to any suggestions :)
---
So you not only subbed but also payed 30 dollar for BFA or is DH a free class?
---
 Hello, I'm Jerriblank. Thirty-two years ago I dropped out of high  school and ran away from real life responsibilites. Oh, I made a lot of "online friends"... did a lot  of time. I was a blizzard fan, a user and a loser. I stoled a game time card... Did some  more time. But now I'm *back* in Classic! And though the faces may have changed, the hassles are just the same.
---
Much of classic is that there is danger everywhere, and being aware that there could be a rogue lurking around anywhere, or a ganksquad somewhere adds to that experience, at least in my opinion. Faction war is real, you miss out on all that by going PvE.
---
Evryone I talked said orc and undead is the best PvP races, so yeah Horde is better choice for you. If you ask me I hate Underity, it's dark, disgusting and it's a big damn labyrinth, I never find anything there. I loved Thunder bluff, that city is beautiful.
---
I played fury in BC. I remember that being incredibly busy, was it the same in PBC?
---
Tauren. Classic isnt about min/maxing
---
Oh man, that mara staff. 3.8s of ass-pounding fury. Totally underrated.
---
Peeveepee

But then you can't run a game in fullscreen mode, can you?

&gt;" Your guild will only ask you to tank, IF you have received a lot of tank gear. " how do you know his guild behaved that way?
---
Because you can't tank without tank gear.
---
&gt;" Your guild gave you that tank gear under the assumption that you would tank when needed." how do you know his guild behaved that way?
---
Because tank gear is limited supply. You give tank gear to people who want to tank. It's freaking common sense.
---
&gt;" If you don't want to tank for your guild, then don't accept tank gear. " how do you know he did accept any tank gear?
---
It's common sense. Literally. And you have failed to understand common sense 3 times now. Enjoy Classic.
---
Orc gets stun resist but Tauren get mad big hit ranges and makes it easier to chase people running away.
---
What are you credentials? I mean, clearly you’re an orthopedic specialist of some kind. And clearly, my carpal tunnel from playing WoW is a psychological hallucination of sorts.
---
August 13th.
---
At level 55 as a tank you can do the following dungeons, order in increasing difficulty: 
---
1) ZF
---
2) Mara
---
3) ST
---
4) BRD (you will struggle to clear everything as a level 55 tank, I personally never go to BRD without a tank at least level 58)
---
5) LBRS (you aren’t clearing this with a 55 tank)
---
6) Dire Maul E (probably aren’t clearing this at 55)
---
The rest of these you aren’t clearing at 55.
---
7) Dire Maul N (not clearing this at 55)
---
8) Dire Maul W
---
9) Strat Living
---
10) Strat UD
---
11) Scholo
---
Rogue in PvE isn't as bad as most people think. Most spam, but it's very unnecessary. You're still waiting for energy Regen to use your abilities regardless. And the people that spam as a rogue are always running dry. Whereas you want to raid with between 40-70 energy at all times so you have the resource for other abilities like kick. Most bad rogues will miss kicks cause of ability spam and low energy.
---
Perfect Yeti Hide
---
Great point, totally forgot about the world bosses! I never played enough to experience those back then, but i can imagine on a PVE server you're just doomed to watch them kill it right in front of you.
---
Good point!
---
Both classes can’t pvp well in their pve spec. PvE frost is pretty bad for pvp and fury is much worse than arms in pvp. You can tank 60 dungeons in a dps spec with 0 issues
---
800k *free* accounts.
---
If you head on over to the Warcraft Radio website at [warcraftradio.com](https://warcraftradio.com), there's going to be a lot of news there for you!
---
Do you mean the debuffs mages put once they're fire? :O
---
True, but orcs are on another level in pvp, which is what I enjoy the most :(.
---
8.2 is great man, give it a shot.
---
Hey Brother! I woke up with Carpal Tunnel symptons today too! 
---
First thing I did was just order a M570 Trackball mouse for the time being (It's half off on Amazon Canada right now).
---
Biggest thing is your setup, what can you change to make your arm get more support and take the pressure off your wrist (look into vertical mice too, I think logitec just released a new one).
---
As for gameplay styles I'm not sure, bursty damage might be the easiest thing to go for (mage or WF shaman maybe?)
---
That might be classic for you, it's all personal preference. There's a reason PvP was more popular early vanilla but lost a lot of people to PvE realms as time went on.
---
Can you link some of the guides? I'm not sure what you're looking at, but I don't think anything about the process of kiting will change. The issue will just be you getting hit from a further distance while kiting, but the actual process of kiting stays the same.
---
So you're saying "You think you do, but you don't"? Well, that's a hot take.
---
Dwarf warrior
---
And get banned in the process.. This is not Private server shittery. Classic will use modern botting detections.
---
Lead off with this next time. Great points, I think everyone here has convinced me.
---
Way I see it, this is a significant upgrade for a tank that lasts a long time, and at best, a small survivability upgrade for a hunter, actually sacrificing dps. If you aren't popping full +HP, + Stam consumes as a hunter, then you shouldn't be taking this cloak ever.  How else can you convince ppl you need more survivability?
---
PvP, without it theres gunna be a lot less content until bgs come out
---
That was always the beauty of WoW to me. The only game that can consistently run quite well on even the most potato-ey of computers.
---
I've been doing that for 15 years and Im still alive, pretty dissapointing. I stopped when classic was announced, I now have the will to live. Thanks Blizzard.
---
Another question about Warlocks, how is the soul shard farming? Not that bad, annoying etc... ?
---
I will sub on the 13th. My first since Wrath.
---
Ugh
---
Ret Paladin, you really never use anything really. If you dont like that, go hunter, for sure.
---
I could make 10 servings og spaghetti in 30 seconds... IT would just be raw spaghetti in a Bowl though
---
It's August 13th but not sure if they have an exact time setup yet.
---
scholo is easy, strath is annoying but relatively easy too
---
They are doing classic because players wanted it.
---
Keyword being "players".
---
Everyone who needs to know, knows.
---
Yeah I mean on paper horde would be the best choice but like I said I just enjoy the Alliance leveling areas so much more plus Stormwind and Ironforge are such nice cities to be in.
---
I’d say warrior if you are lucky enough to level with a healer. Your leveling problems are fixed by the priest, and if he’s healing and you’re tanking, dungeon groups will be easy to make. 
---
If you want to level warrior, I’d say I’d rather go for that in this situation.
---
Binding my auto/steady macro to MW Down during TBC started giving me issues. I really don't miss a one button spam rotation.
---
Meh been subbed more or less consistently since vanilla with little breaks here and there, I missed most of MoP which was my longest break.
---
I'm worried how difficult and disappointing it will be as a PvP hunter trying to get Brokentooth. It really doesn't sound fun.
---
Losing Auberdine, the ground cracks everywhere and the quests being about elementals instead of spirits is a lot to me...
---
It can be done, just not before lvl 40
---
I am looking forward to the Barrens being united again and hopefully the chat will be just as toxic, funny, and dysfunctional as before.  I am looking to the world bosses being back.
---
This sub will freak out about anything that didnt exist in 2006. They want everyone to play how they think they should play. Just do you and fuck the people telling you how to enjoy something.

You're playing wrong then. Dumping energy the second you get it is a bad habit.

Sure, there's probably a few out there like that. They're likely the minority though, I would bet that even most college kids have some kind of small TV available. Hell, even i they don't have one you can find small TVs and monitors on Craigslist for like $30.
---
What? Dagger spec is more gear dependent than hemo but dagger rogues will be better when AQ comes out.
---
Raid leader, MT, MH, and class leaders. Not hard concepts to understand.
---
Having Class leaders is important because it puts the best players mentoring less experienced ones. It's a hell of a lot less headaches.
---
Low effort.  Same thing posted yesterday.
---
Hahahaha for some reason I can't stop laughing and looking at the vid
---
Dude who cares Let It Go
---
Eat and play should be the first step
---
Not currently subbed but I will on the 13th for the name reserve. I probably wouldn't normally but I got a couple free days and used all the gold I had to buy some WoW tokens for classic.
---
Class leaders are for ego tripping nerds.
---
Really? From your link:
---
 *While we won’t know for sure until they start doing beta testing, the demo from Blizzcon was a separate install from “retail.” To be perfectly honest, I’d be surprised if they weren’t ultimately separate.* 
---
Read that months ago. Not definitive, only includes beta experience, and a lot less attitude. Did *you* read it?
---
You and u/itssang are Troll-buddies?
---
Every add on is *unnecessary.* Besides, my comment was in its technical viability, not a value statement on whether it should be.
---
Now stop boring me with your mediocrity.
---
This is just 100% wrong.
---
Undead is the best shadow priest vs any class that isn't another shadow priest.
---
Human is the best shadow priest vs other shadow priest.
---
This means troll cannot be the best.
---
Quartz for very slightly quicker mounting/casting, it tells you when you can cancel the cast and still get it off.
---
And they always demand a link to a blue post and a 5 page dissertation on the most asinine questions.

It was part of the game to yell and scream and moan over the latest changes.
---
That system was garbage, it just matches 5 people. You could end up with 5 rogues.
---
I say follow your friends. You'll regret it when your 60 and all your friends are starting an UBRS run and you're stuck in Stormwind, because they're on a different server than you.
---
Edit; that said I'm rolling PvP with some old friends
---
Eh. stun resist is sick, but playing a race you truly love is way better. Hit range and warstomp are great for pvp. And as a warrior, you'll be playing a lot with others. Dont let 25% added stun resist make or break your decision.
---
The Razer Naga is a bit out of my budget but I'll definitely look for cheaper options of that ergonomic nature, thanks. Just been using a standard mouse so far.
---
I got that Microsoft ergonomic keyboard 4000 this year. Heard good things. I've heard mechanical keyboards help but I'm surprised since they're so clicky. Seems like a cash register type of thing.
---
Can you link me to your mouse pad? Or do you know what it's called
---
Does it have a cool down on use? And yeah noone will farm that even in the best case scenario. We are talking of hours of farming per boss.
---
No, the LFG tool from TBC was just a bulletin board. It did not match or auto-invite.
---
Agreed wholeheartedly. I'll be tanking again, but it's hell on the fingers. Using Bloodthirst/Revenge/Sunder on every GCD, and continuing that HS spam. Hands would be sore after particularly threat intensive fights.
---

Tiny white girl destroyed by big black bull.
---
And guess what...the beta has happened. It was a separate download. Did you even read what I said about retail not having the classic files?
---
2h is still better at cleaving down packs of mobs. Not uncommon in horde MC speedruns since there's only 3 single target bosses there, all others you can cleave.
---
Having someone use the 2handers that drop is also useful. You don't want 20 people going for viskag.
---
Yea I think the important take is the bar for classic's success is set very low right now. There's no big expensive ad campaigns going on and no massive dev costs to recoup. Everything that's been communicated about classic points to it being run as a lean project with the expectation of minimal overhead (as minimal as a major MMO game can be).
---
Not sure if your issues are in both hands, but I used a Nostromo N52 back during vanilla (Razer makes an updated one, the Tartarus) that might help alleviate some of the repetitiveness. All the keys are programmable, and I remember I tied the scroll wheel back then to switch into different druid forms.
---
Also, there's MMO mouses too.
---
The gamepad had a little learning curve, but you'll be a beast once you get down all the key combinations.
---
Amazon; blade hawks, it’s got leds on it too because I’m fabulous.
---
Paladin is your best choice.
---
Really? Somehow I managed to not do that, and I was playing classic. Almost seems like people bitching isn’t actually part of the game files...
---
The same way it’s always been played since leeway always existed.
---
With mage only one...
---
Beast master Hunter "It's also a fairly efficient spec, so you'll level quickly"
---
It isn't fairly efficient, it is the most efficient in the game.
---
A healer can dps while a dps cannot heal. It’s why druids are considered so flexible. They aren’t the best in any category but the can work in any role. Healers and tanks will always be in demand. Dps tends to be a dime a dozen.
---
Vanilla wow is not very demanding except for high end PvP with consumes, actives and trinkets
---
Play what you want to
---
I think it was incredibly popular.
---
A large amount of people only still play it because they have invested too much time/money into the game to simply give it up with ease.
---
Hearthstone is a game of RNG topped with RNG surrounded by RNG oh and they threw in a patch WITH RNG.  It is a shitty game that has an expansion every 3-4 months that will cost you more than 2 premium games.  It is the ideal F2P game that costs insane amounts of money to keep up with.
---
Whoops. Mine does so I often forget that some do not. My bad! Forget everything I said then lol
---
That just found 5 people. It did not consider roles at all.
---
Good lord, this makes my chest hurt thinking about it. Is it hot in here? I can't breathe....
---
No offense, I just don't really see the point in them tbh. 
---
&gt;important because it puts the best players mentoring less experienced ones
---
Any good officer should be able to accomplish this surely. As opposed to 3 different Class Leads all trying to coordinate with the MH on top of all 15 healers, seems like more of a headache to me.

Tirisfal Glades.  I hate what they did to it in Cata.

I drink Milk Fuel for every meal so I don’t have to stop gaming or working.

Only against a few classes, not everyone has stuns.  War stomp and character looks are always relevant though.

A mage can do everything. You can PVP well, PvE at the top tier, provide CC for dungeons, provide carrying and utility via food/portals for your new friends. You'll ad a lot of value when you're in a group, as well as be one of the strongest solo chars out there.
---
I along with many others I know used mouse macros all the time for tanking recently in BFA and never had an issue. It definitely helps with the repetitiveness and is easier on our aging joints. Work smarter, not harder ;)
---
What are you trying to do in the game? Speed level? PVE/PVP? Tank/DPS/Heal? Just have fun overall? You have a wide variety of classes that you want to choose from (almost all lol) so it will all depend on your playstyle/how you want the experience to be.
---
I am pretty sure you need to do morrowgrain or runecloth turn ins to get to exalted on classic. But you will need far less of those by leveling in the ne areas.
---
I wouldnt let this deter you from playing dps. Dont play a tank or healing class if you want to dps. Dont worry about groups, they will happen. Sometimes just takes a little longer, or you spend an extra evening doing quests or grinding instead of X-instance. Not worth playing tank/heals only bc of making easy groups. If everything was easy, we'd all be playing retail.
---
Speaking from a classic perspective (not Pserver), Enchanting burns more money than it earns. The main reasons are:
---
- nothing but the dusts and shards are available for the AH, you have to sell everything in trade chat
---
- very low limitations for disenchanting (lvl 5 I think), so everyone can disenchant BoEs very easily with an alt
---
- early on if you were an enchanter and no one needed that 60 blue, you were expected to dis and roll for the shard (overabundance of shards in AH)
---
- the best enchants use specific components like Righteous Orbs and people never had any. So they were expecting you to provide them for way less money than they were worth. I always hated that.
---
There are some niche markets like wands in the beginning or the early glow enchants. But overall it's a very difficult market. Also it's very difficult to level and without stealth it's hard to reach the trainer on your own (Uldaman).

---
Relax.
---
Pally is definitely the right choice. Just map all on your keys to holy light and smash your head against the keyboard. No risk for carpal tunnel there!
---
Not necessarily. The BiS for feral just has a proc that can be abused due to changes later implemented to shapeshifter after the item was designed.
---
Before the Druid talent tree upgrade, you needed 20 points into resto to get the the spell "intensity" (energy on shift). You needed 31 into feral to reduce the cost of shapeshifting by 25%. In the balance tree, you needed 8 points to remove the shifting gcd. After the tree changes, you only needed 8 points into balance and 5 into resto to get all of this which makes powershifting viable.

Check out willitclassic for addons I believe most Addon websites now have a dedicated to having separate sections for classic addons.
---
Addons depends on your play style imo; but here are some help addons:
---
Questie
---
Auto swing timer
---
Ezquest 
---
Ezcordinates
---
EzJunk
---
Titans panel bar
---
Faster Looting
---
Quest XP tracker
---
That's why theres not going to be that many servers over all.
---
You have to do morrow grain and runecloth.  Running to Darnassus will help you on the back end, but it’s not the difference between getting exalted and not.
---
Pretty much. Their infrastructure catch up, and the ability for wireless networks to circumvent local lag have made them the hottest market.

Min maxing &amp; faction stuff aside, which male race looks coolest for a Warlock? Talking animations etc. 
---
I like Orc a good deal but their giant shoulders are kinda annoying. Human looks good too, but I dont like their hair/beard options. Gnomes seem fun but also very small and its hard to see your gear etc. Undead I don't really like that much tbh.
---
yea but how is that better than warstomp, which already sucks?
---
Word is they paid ninja $1 million to play at launch
---
I get what you're saying, I made this post in the context of the beta. I meant it way beyond raiding (not being level 41-60 and that literally being a bit beyond the midway point of the net levelling experience, all profession related content gated behind said lack of level / rep, not accessing the full world due to your level).
---
I think I didn't really articulate that fully and I can see where you thought I meant raiding.
---
I genuinely consider everything the beta offered to be a scratch on a scratch of the surface of world of Warcraft.
---
Isn't that what reddit is for nowadays?
---
100% scaling is at 3.5sec cast.
---
PvE. I’ve never thought the PvP in WoW was very good, it can be entertaining in certain situations but usually just ends up being a numbers game (level, gear, amount of people, etc) or involves some kind of rng (crits, windfury, chance to stun)
---
Oh man Ive never been more fearful of dying. Like 90 percent of the time id be ok with dying at any time. When classic was announced it put the fear of dying back in me
---
Sweet thanks
---
thank you!
---
Just play non competitive and you can do any class. Level slowly and don't loot ever mob.

However, if you want to move fast, be competitive, PvP and pve, I would say, don't play wow. If simple classes you have to constantly hit button ALL THE TIME, and fast. There is no getting around this. 
---
Simple looting while leveling is bad. Oh use a different key bind... Well those "good" key binds, disappear fast.
---
That's interesting, did you read that somewhere?
---
I'm planning mine out but across multiple characters as well as coordinating between my friend.
---
My first character will be a roge with herbs and alchy, next up will be a warrior with minning and eng which I will mostly keep because of the cross support between the two both as I level the warrior and once he is up to speed with the rogue. I have a hard time seeing
---
My friend will probably roll his mage with enchanting and tailoring but I think he's going to have time issues and will fall behind in keeping up with my starting pace. 
---
So far the only certain things are my alchy-herbs rogue and rolling a warrior some point after him. But the deeper I get into warriors, both on the tanking and dps side, I hear more of the important of engineering so I'm almost sold on that.
---
 The final piece to the planning puzzle is mapping out some routes for gathering, and some key recipes to grab on the way up.
---
You literally don't even understand what's being talked about, but you want someone to pay attention to you. Your definition of insufferable is necessarily warped by an unearned sense of entitlement.
---
You can also just farm shards on trash
---
that's so bad lol.  My Spriest on LH has pre-bis raid gear and anathema and my feedback procs for like 270, which also drains 270 of their mana, it also has no proc cooldown like shadow guard..
---
And that's why I was sticking to things we do know, not things we can't possibly know.
---
Lol so true
---
I may, but there a lot of people who played vanilla 15 years ago and have no idea because they aren't interested in that community.
---
Right. Blizzard won't launch Classic with the Classic build they used in the beta for testing Classic. Instead they will use an entirely different and untested build. Do you even realise how stupid that sounds?
---
You already had your answer. Literally ages ago. But you keep debating like a child, claiming your question was extremely hard to answer, when it wasn't. Why?
---
It takes literally 2secs to google "wow classic download size" and you get TONNES of posts like this https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/download-size/55347
---
Like, for crying out loud, are you trolling or just completely incompetent on the internet?
---
The roccat nyth is amazing as well. Modular side buttons.
---
The whole honor system is pretty awful and could use some sort of revamp.. but the nochanges crowd would flip, even though 99% of them will never see rank 14.
---
Another dumbass that thinks every gamer watches twitch
---
Im not even the same guy. Just someone giving you genuine advice. Jesus youre insufferable tho.
---
Yes though it can depend. On stun-able mobs a pair of rogues can easily lockdown 1 elite, sap/blind 2 more (depending on spec), and provide some of the best ST dps. On the flip side a dps priest can easily MC a human elite taking off a lot of pressure from big pulls and hopefully putting some nasty abilities to your teams use. I’d say comp for a dungeon can be important for clearing with ease.
---
Wonder if it stopped after the first charge. Probably not. F
---
Me: the guy making a joke about losing the game when you die
---
You: well actually, depending on what your beliefs are..
---
The fuck outta here with your nonsense lol
---
The main reason I hadn't considered RP servers was I assumed a majority of content creators/streamers are going to try and make those their homes, and i'd just rather be away from that community if at all possible.
---
If I'm cooking say oven roasted chicken breasts with vegetables or something like that I'm easily spending 45 ish minutes in total prep and cook time. Getting everything out, chopping vegetables, lining my pan, seasoning everything, 20 minutes in the oven plus 10 minutes to rest and plate food. Then if you're not eating alone (many of us aren't) you sit down for somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes to eat? That's just for one meal at dinner. Throw in a 30 minute to 1 hour lunch break at work and 5 to 15 minutes for morning breakfast/coffee.
---
2 hours a day on total food time seems totally reasonable. You could easily cut it down, but it's not a crazy amount. Some days you'll grab a $5 box from taco Bell and eat in front of your PC other days you might spend 2+ hours on a homemade lasagna.
---
If it was truly was there wouldn’t be layering : /
---
this. i too think vanilla will do great, but people act like blizzard's pride will be severely wounded, or that it'll matter more to them than making millions of dollars. not a chance.
---
also yeah i dont enjoy the current mmorpg gameplay but apparently millions do
---
lbrs is really hard to do at 55. i would not run it before 58+, especially not tank it.

---
Mods here are actually quite attentive and I think they should be extremely stern and unforgiving with banning people who post shit tier trashposts.
---
Good, would be lame if they were in the game from start.
---
Both have strong points. I switched back and forth. I personally preferred daggers for a couple of reasons. 1. The fact that you have to get to your opponents back is very fun and is just a super good habit to get into even when you switch to hemo. 2. Dat burst (warlock die before they know it) 3. From my experience, easier to get your hands on good daggers since most people will spec swords. This last one is my personal experience, I wasnt super hardcore back in the day but when daggers dropped, I got them typically with ease, swords? You got some stiff competition. Ultimately they are both fun specs. Daggers were always my thing though, I went mutilate the minute that talent came out and was a little peeved when they made it so you didn't have to be on the back in wrath. Play em both! That's the fun of a rogue, in pvp you have a ton of utility and theres multiple options.
---
This was my experience/approach in vanilla as well. The time wasted with groups that fall apart just had too much of an opportunity cost. If it was a group of friends I was in if not I was in UnGoro and Winterspring
---
Resilience and warlock+druid. nightmare material
---
If you can handle playing a lanky troll do it I guess. People are saying they have the best threat/dps boost because of their racial.
---
Classic is our only hope now.
---
tf is a waste of a debuff slot
---
I'm going to hell for laughing at this.
---
As a teacher, launch is my second week of the school year and after taking a whole summer off I really can’t take off work... looks like I’m just going to have to play a moderate bit in my evenings and then no life it on my weekends! Lol
---
Dearborn heights ,here! Have 1 or 2 buddies around the area that r going into classic with me.
---
This is a public service announcement:
---
If you plan on resubbing your old account and don't have the password find your CD key from your box and take a picture of it and your ID to send to Blizz customer service in the original ticket. It will make the process faster for you. I recommend doing it soon because a lot of people will be trying to do the same thing. Stay ahead of the pack.
---
Yeah I just looked it over. Excited to see it will have archives of Athalus' show. I have all the Blue Plz and Epic eps sitting in a google drive folder somewhere.
---
The second change is actually a nerf to tanking, not a buff. It increases the threat generated by DPS characters affected by two or more threat reduction effects.
---
If you're saying that tanking was trivialized by the Shield Slam change, are you implying that tanking was always  trivial in Naxx?
---
Ffxiv shadowbringers came out. Played that story. Levelling to get as much at the point I'm happy with. So just one tank to get to 70 then I'm gonna play some Xbox that should tide me over to classic.
---
Also going to start riding again an indoor bike park has opened so I'm taking my bmx down to see i can break both my legs on the 25th August. I work a manual labour job that needs me to lift. Can't lift with broken legs.
---
Totally agree, and any streamer who does anything longer than a 12 hour stream is definitely on an amp.
---
For warlock having to resummon pet and recasting demon armor after you Rez. It sucks in a pvp setting cause there's a bunch of long casts and you need food/water to get back up to 100%. Other classes don't have to deal with this downtime and it makes corpse camping a warlock very easy.
---
Min/maxers are saving stims for launch. Until then, they're counting on the 100% speed bonus from metabolic syndrome.
---
Challenge accepted
---
My bpm is 69
---
Is your Carpal Tunnel Syndrome worse with Mouse + KB or worse with an Xbox One Controller?
---
I had pretty bad Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (elbow compression instead of wrist compression) until I had surgery and a controller was much easier for me to use.
---
The reason I ask is because [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/home/) is coming to Classic and despite the memes, you can play the game well with it. There are some roles/classes that are easier though.
---
To stop speanding 5 hours eating every day?
---
The issue with leatherworking is the gear you can make from it can be replaced fairly easily. Engineering has items that can only be used by engineers that will be useful through all content. Leveling with LW can help you keep your gear up to date as you level, it just doesn't play much of a role in end game.
---
Or you live off something other than microwave meals.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0L4vCUVC8E
---
For some spec it was the case and this is fine. If you want the best gear you should be good at everything to get what you want.
---
It's not about getting an original name, its getting the high status hard to get names.
---
After they finally revealed the release date, I knew I wasn’t going to be able to play on release day because I would be away for a business trip for training and that I would not have internet access due to it being in a remote location (it was at a military base). 
---
Then, last week, the training was cancelled and I now have several days of uninterrupted free time to play, couldn’t be happier.
---
Most game commercials I see advertised on boxed 60 dollar games and mobile titles. Blizzard only marketed Overwatch's launch and nothing after that. Starcraft: Remastered didnt get anything outside of Korea.
---
you don't get an XP from winning a duel so that's not going to work. Focus on quests till 20ish then you should be able to find a large grinding spot with plenty of mobs to pull
---
Hold on I have to blow my brains out....need to find a shotgun shell.
---
Fk this I will cancel in a heartbeat.
---
That's a good sign for marriage.
---
This is built into the 8.X/1.13 client and defaults to enabled (spells casting on key press instead of release). This has been the case since mid WotLK.

undeda rouge
---
So for the actual video - she lived with minor injuries I believe. Probably more emotionally scarred than anything. 
---
This could have been a lot worse.
---
Be careful. All hybrid classes are expected to heal in raids in classic. 
---
If you can go all in as feral and want to tank you can make that possible but be careful cause lots of warriors will be no life’s and be tanks. Lots of guilds don’t want feral dps. In raids they don’t want enhancement shamans or elemental shamans, but they sure like resto. 
---
You can get lucky and find guilds that’ll accept you as a worse dps but I just want you to know a lot of people will want you to heal while you level, and even more so at 60.
---
Sorry but what is this HOTW? High warlord?
---
I have in the past but right now I'm playing on Mangler, an official EQ progression server.
---
Yeah I heard the "you are pretty good, for a huntard" type comment quite a few times. Like you say it's not an ok slur to use.
---
Even though I won't be playing a hunter this time around I think I might make a point of highlighting this if anyone in my guild does it.
---
Sorry I offended you, maybe next time you make a joke make it funny?
---
I played PvP. I enjoyed the rng of open world PvP. But there is bad with the good. Expect to get corpse camped. Have sweet pulls ruined. Having alts and being okay with switching is important for mental health on PvP.
---
PvP. Even though I am mainly a pve player, playing on pve servers makes no sense to me. It would make the game so much more boring.
---
When did they say they'll be changing classes and items?
---
Oh i didn't see.
---
Ya I downrank as soon as I have the option to do so. Mana efficiency matters even at low levels.
---
Popping an arcanite dragonling can get a naxx level boss down in less than a minute. Skyrocketing dps. 1 hr cool down puts that on 3 bosses a night typically, or four if you raid for 3 hours. 
---
If you think engineering is just a fraction % more you’re unbelievably incorrect.
---
Remember when blizzard was a gothic-horror video game company? xd
---
Retail is where you have to worry about carpal tunnel, not so much in classic.
---
Well think about it this way. On a raid fight with movement ( I believe exceeding 5s total) the runspeed enchant is BiS. Applying that to pvp, if you are rooted/snared away from your kill target you do 0 dps.  
---
As for the numbers it’s 1.30 of the base value if the sources are correct.  
---
1000 crit becomes 2000  
---
1000 crit becomes 2300 with lethality  
---
2.3/2.0 = 1.15 is how it is explained
---
Started a couple of days ago. Still have bo idea what i am doing
---
Yeah. Some guilds want names for rosters to quick start the guilds and then just get the guild together from as early as possible. So at least mains. And some people have had the same character name for years. Some over a decade. Their name is them. Playing with a different name is like running with someone else's feet.
---
Then you get the jerks who want to grab every iteration of asmongold they can fathom to make him scream on stream.

---
shave my balls you bigot
---
no you don't, there's enough rep even with classic values but it includes feralas/ws etc so you can't do it for your 40 mount. Even at \~40 you'll be halfway into revered to exalted as a human.
---
One guy said a thing. Whoopidy doo!
---
Yeah that's the second time I've seen that suggestion and I like it. Having an alt to cool down on or avoid a murder squad for a little bit
---
Not gonna sub until the 26th
---
I’m hoping classic will take up the “late night drinking” time slot
---
This I really dependent on how much they’re willing to mentor. I in my guild had to basically do my class lead for him while he sat there doing less dps than I and 2 others, while I also was the one who mentored newer people. He didn’t even join the warlock channel in chat, would just ignore us all.
---
That would be great. A couple of people in my guild now do the generic casino macro:
---
    Minimum bid: 5g | Maximum bid: Unlimited 
---
    How to play: Trade your bet amount
---
    Do NOT roll before I announce your name in RaidWarning
---
    If you do, your roll is NOT counted
---
    1-66 = Lose | 67-97 = Double amount | 98-100 = Triple
---
It's dumb gambling but its a fun little way to kill time. Poker/blackjack would be a huge improvement to that.
---
The bottom line is that it changed the way the community functioned and seperated PvP players from PvE players. If people feel that it was for better or worse is subjective.
---
Why call out someone else’s grammar when you have your own grammar issues? People type on multiple platforms. Totally irrelevant when you can understand my point just fine. Just trying to use that to say I’m dumb and your smart. 
---
So warstomp is bad if you suck at using it? Well no shit. Every ability is bad if you suck at using it. 
---
Ultimately It comes down to the possibility of resisting a stun or having your own. Considering shamans can trinket a stun and don’t have their own stun, warstomp is very useful to them.
---
&gt;It also lead to the epitome of "clown suits" as every piece of gear was neon colored with a random pallet and everything that wasn't in a set looked like clown vomit when mixed.
---
Fortunately, you could just use a set then. After you geared your first set after hitting 70 you would be over the clown suits for the rest of the expansion. The tier sets looked great in TBC.
---
This is unlike Vanilla where sure - random items were less neon coloured, but still random - and you often had to use those. Most people didn't use tier sets because they sucked - paladins ran around in cloth dresses for god sake.
---
It was a few months of clown suits at the most even for casuals, after that you looked epic. Vanilla you just looked ridiculous as many classes throughout *all* of vanilla. ^(Oh no, I guess all vanilla fanatics will downvote me now for praising anything not vanilla.)
---
Blizzard hasn't missed a release date in over 10 years and I wouldn't bet on that changing.
---
They would release a buggy game way sooner than they would miss their date
---
Pasta takes 3-5 minutes to cook, what are you on about. Even if it's not fresh, the cook time is never that high. 
---
Also, a real bolognese recipe takes all day to simmer down if you want to do it properly. But if you're not going to do that, might as well caramelize the beef and make your sauce in a good 15-20 minutes. My 2 cents anyway.
---
That being said... hes still comparing Fortnite and Apex to WoW.
---
Some generes need marketing. Some dont.
---
Windfury, Flurry, 1.7 weapon speed, parry-haste....you name it.
---
Between resto shaman and resto druid. If I want to both raid and pvp w/o respeccing, which is more helpful in premade pvp. Deep resto shaman or resto druid. 
---
I know hybrid ele is a possibility but I'll need the mana regen of mana tide until later phases.
---
LBRS is a deceptive beast, while it is challenging that challenge is more due to the trash being so tightly packed together and so numerous, if you bring a group capable of large scale and long term CC then there is no fight in there that isn't doable with a full level 55 group.
---
That said yes it is alot of additional effort that most people would tend to avoid and wait for higher levels.
---
Your top rank heal is the most mana efficient one until you have about 300 healing
---
Class leaders mean less full discord channels than role leaders. 
---
That's my entire pitch I guess.
---
Ymmv, not needed but some leadership is required and how it's divided is largely preference based.
---
AFAIK Murder doesn't work against other players. Only mobs with the Humanoid type.
---
if they did that then a lot of people would leave the original servers and eventually they would be really low pop or even dead. i can see why people like FRESH but i'm not a fan tbh
---
Good reads?
---
Well I wasn’t really focusing on APM flexing. More like 50+ different key combinations might be difficult for someone with carpel tunnel. Alt 4 —-&gt;cntrl spacebar—-&gt; shift tilda
---
It's always a problem of definition. That's two people who disagree what "serious" means.
---
You cant make profit if you dont have customers. People will quit if layering stays in the game.
---
My WoW sub ran out a couple months ago.  Will be paying for ESO+ instead til the classic launch.
---
You know what's a good class lead? Google and YouTube
---
Yeah but you'll have to waste GCD reapplying it. Also does feedback proc shadow guard and shadow weaving?
---
So I've never played any at endgame, but I know priests are the more versatile healing class - the quintessential vanilla healer. Paladin are incredibly mana efficient and provide some fun utility, but in raids you are effectively a flash of light bot. Druids are also amazing, but have a more complex rotation from what I understand. A lot of people will tell you they don't perform as well, but for what you lack in raw healing you make up for in raid utility. A big turn off for some is the lack of a regular resurrection spell. I think priests are the most valued all around.
---
Since Wow Classic character creation will require an active sub, it is pretty obvious Blizz wants to make a quick buck by forcing those without sub to resub 2 weeks earlier ;)
---
Stop being an angry childish hypocrite lmao
---
Nah man, quitting your job.
---
I like it, these first three cover the history of Draenor, Draenei, origin of the Horde and 1st and 2nd war. Good high fantasy books, nothing spectacular but for a fan of Warcraft, it's great!

i like looking at the comments on wowhead from 2005-2007 for these BiS items that people were calling crap then, fun stuff
---
I didn't know about it until a week ago through a post.
---
&gt;Pvp hemo relies on pooling energy and using CDs to lock down or counter other class CDs
---
Exactly, I feel like hemo sacrifices damage output for....memability? I'm not saying that hemo is bad, Mute (Rogues take zero skill) showed that it has great potential, but deep assassination (seal fate) for daggers has so much burst damage that, to me, it's too good to pass up if PvP was my focus.
---
That was my spec when vanilla was live though. I'm going to give combat swords a try this time around but going to experiment for sure to see what gives me the biggest bang for my buck.
---
For people that want a special name it's cringe? Whatever floats your boat brother.
---
Hello I am Anduin Wyrnn and you are watching the Disney channel.
---
... But that doesn't change that it may not be the best heal for every situation. Overhealing =/= mana efficiency.
---
Imo, yeah definitely good for the pop fantasy genre. Fair warning for audiobook people, Christie Golden is a far better writer than orator, and can't do an Arthas voice to save her life.
---
I agree about Thunder Bluff. I love the music and the elevators, but I could never get behind the different levels of the city being accessed through one tower. Also, the bridges to other bluffs confused me for a while.
---
Why play then? Try to heal up.
---
Wow is a drug i guess
---
Rise of the Horde is soooo gooood
---
What do you use for this purpose? I struggle with carpal tunnel myself and are looking into fixes.
---
Yeah they really fucked up Marvel and Pixar.
---
Heart of the wild, it’s a Druid spec that goes deep feral and is also halfway decent at healing.
---
Basically the meta of Oomkin.
---
Hue Hue.
---
On the one hand, cool.  On the other hand, seeing as I can keep finding good enough new names 15 years into the launch of a game, I think I'll be fine.
---
From what I can remember, Shaman are the better raid healers between the two because of chain heal.  Druid are excellent in BG's though, and make awesome flag carriers in WSG.
---
If I was picking between them, I would go Shaman easily.  Totem buffs are great in classic.
---
MFW Classic launches
---
Going through EPL and WPL in the push to 60 is usually more intellegent than people give it credit, as Stratholme and Scholomance have quests within that require you to do long quests in those zones and elsewhere before you can even have access to the dungeon quest.
---
So many great quests totally ignored because people simply grinded furlbogs or Yeti's in Winterspring or elementals and dinosaurs in Ungoro.
---
I keep 2 ranks of my slow heal top rank and next to top rank for similar reasons but in all honesty dps should never take that much damage in a early dungeon and I was aming the statement at someone that have not healed befor. If you have doubts about how much to heal early game it is always better to go whit your max rank it is by far the most healing/mana
---
Getting ganked over and over by a character that is at least 40 levels higher than  you. I play this game to have fun not so another can have fun at my expense.  If classes were properly balanced for 1v1 and you couldn't kill people outside of a few levels it would be a different story and a PvP server might actually be fun but when a level 60 is in redridge killing level 20s its a fucking joke.
---
1. Bullshit. Nobody waits until your full health and ready for a fight. They wait until you pull too many mobs or are at low health.
---
2. Bullshit. I've never had my faction come to spot X because the other faction is being dicks. Everyone says the same thing, log another toon or go to another area. Nobody comes to assist even if it's just a rogue killing NPCs.
---
3. World PvP - It was fun but the battle protion only happened once in a while and one side would try and push them back into the others town. Most of the time it was huge long lines over players around 45 yards apart with random people pushing in and dying.
---
4. See ganking. They will be targeting players at level 50 because they still give honor and die quickly.
---
5. We can see the other faction and we do interact with the we just cant attack them if they are not PvP flagged.
---
PvPing is about having an advantage. You all dont want to hear it but its the truth. If you all were such great PvPers you could roll a PvE server and stay flagged all the time. If your so good, the other player having the opener shouldn't matter.
---
That makes sense. I'd read or heard somewhere that they did scale well with the right gear, but I can see how this was misconstrued. Thanks for the input. Would you say that a t2 paladin will be better off pvp-wise with a spell damage build?
---
Fubar. Top and bottom screen rows that house the vast majority of addons and are highly customizable. With this it’s good to have swstats got damage, your class addons, gives hit and critical ratings and shows latency, tanking stats and all that. Highly recommend. Takes a while to fully figure out but once you get it down it’s amazing
---
It's a very pretty game lobby, though XD ^semi-/s
---
What they did to Star Wars is what has me scared.
---
What is a good profession to pair with tailoring for a clothie
---
That has nothing to do with it. Blood elves are *literally* high elves that just renamed themselves. It's like if China suddenly announced that they are no longer Chinese, but "Gagakuse". Sure they might have a different name according to themselves, but they are still the same race. Nothing actually changed.
---
Blood elves named themselves so because of the massacre of their people, any blood elf could just choose to still identify as a high elf.
---
The reason for green eyes is exposure to fel. After some time without fel magic, or if never exposed to fel magic (as some blood elves never were) they will have golden eyes or similar (depends on the game, it isn't super consistent across games).
---
ClassicLFG is an addon that is almost identical to it but also allows queuing up based on your role.
---
Also in aq40/Naxx
---
I made characters for both PvP and PvE. Both servers give me a satisfying experience. I personally like engaging on PvP, not because of the fighting but to play in a game that represent a time of war. PvP does make me feel like I have to watch my back, be vigilant, careful of the danger that lurks in the world of war.. craft.
---
Nah, it did match players.  Go log on to any TBC private server and look for yourself.
---
And Star Wars, and Fox, and NFL, and are probably trying to figure out how to get control of UFC, and ruin that also.
---
More people agreeing with someone doesn't make them right. People will always lean UD because of the aesthetic appeal. Devouring plague without procs will destroy your mana pool. Rank 1 shadow guard gives multiple blackout chances, for ranged and melee, hex kf weakness lowers healing, and berserking lets you dish out multiple mindflays. 
---
But whatever, circle jerk being undead because edgy horde boys.

Hey guys, I’m new to the reddit scene here but I was told that this might be a good place to post my classic druid content in hopes to talk about the class a little more &amp; to alleviate some of the negative stereotype with druids. My goal is to shed a little more light on the class back then in hopes to influence those who want to roll druid, but didn’t have the chance to play them in classic.

I’m STOKED to play druid come launch, and I hope to meet some fellow druid players along the way!
---
Feel free to let me know your thoughts.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Damn right, and no meme builds either.

Very hard decision, first of all i am going Horde.I'll play with some friends but i am sure i wont level with them or raid with them, we will end up in different guilds and etc since we have different schedules. I am mainly interested in pvp mostly bgs, but i will want to raid too, will want to clear all MC/BWL/ZG/AQ( if i'm lucky) , aint got so many hopes for Naxx.
---
I already leveled to 60 the classes : Mage,Warlock,Rogue,Priest,Hunter and a warrior from 30 to 60 ( helped a friend level his warrior and he stopped playing so i ended up having a warrior on another account) + allot of classes to mid 40 and etc( note,most of them were leveled on private servers)
---
\- My first pick was Undead mage,( i wont aoe lvl), easy leveling, water,food, portals etc. At 60 you are a farming machine, very easy to 1v1 someone in wpvp, you have the best mobility in the game( and that's why i love this class), and you can mostly pvp in your pve spec. There are so many good things about mages...
---
Now the cons...it will be overpopulated, from the last pservers that i played, mages were like the most played class, gets extremely boring from time to time( i usually respec allot because of this, just so i wont get bored,1 day elemental,1 day pom pyro),very big competition for items, hard to get into a guild.
---
My second is warlock, easy and boring to level,good in wpvp and pvp, although it doesn't have the mobility and kiting of the mage it is awesome. I still like the idea of listening to heavy metal music and playing destro lock in bgs, i always enjoyed playing lock, Warlock=love!
---
Cons,and here allot of people will disagree with me, if i played alliance i would go for warlock first pick...why? Low competition, less populated class...and PALADINS and healers in general(maybe it was a private server thing but alliance always had better healers or more healers in solo que or low rank premades). Now as horde i feel the same way as mage...overpopulated class,lower spots in raids, while you can bring 6-8 mages you only bring around 4 locks. And i suck at farming gold with lock :)
---
my 3rd-4th  are tied.
---
Rogue- super fun to play, good for my solo play style, for a long period of time rogue was one of my favorite classes.
---
Cons- Farming Del rend swords, Ironfoe, hand of justice, i don't think i can do that again( i have the curse of a very bad luck at rolls). Raids are ok..you can pull good dps without any big effort, BUT GOD DAMN how much i hate warriors and other dps needing on all rogue items. And tbh, i don't really like doing bgs as a rogue, especially vs more organised alliance premades.
---
Priest- I loved shadow so much, i felt like a god playing this class, easy to win every 1v1 scenario, very good for solo play, just an awesome class. In fact priest was the last class that i leveled to 60 on a private server, it was late Aq when i dinged(16 slot debuffs), thought to myself i can find a guild that will want me for the shadow debuff and will probably get mc/bwl gear that no caster wants....I was so wrong, no matter how far people were progressed, no one wanted a spriest in the raid or had a non life spriest that played 8+ hours per day .
---
Even in a pvp guild, i was forced to play a healer, and i don't like playing a healer that much in pvp in vanilla.(VIper sting/VIper sting, everyone focuses you,Curse of tongues and from the 6 mages from  your wsg no one decurses). I actually had like the worst experince with priest at 60, but i still kinda like the class and i will always like it.
---
I sometimes think about hunter and shamans but not that much, and i wont play warrior cuz i have no healer friends. As a druid i hate the association of a flag carrier.
---
Good news really. If we're off the Activision radar for now less chance of them ruining it.
---
True but learning to downrank and play with multiple ranks of healing spells is definitely something I would also recommend to a new player before they hit a harder dungeon / raiding environment.
---
... are you me?
---
OMFG i'm not the only one who gets wrist pain from WOW? Its on my mouse hand, ulnar side (pinky side), right where the knob of the wrist bone meets the actual hand. Goes away during the day, but at night it comes back almost as if on command once i start really playing
---
but in this thread, it makes you feel good?
---
do you actually have a 60 spriest on a private vanilla server, or played one during classic?  berserking sucks on Spriest, they don't lose HP, they bubble up until victory.
---
I do think it's weird that there's not at least *some* marketing to reach out to nostalgic fans. My example above is obviously a sample of one.  There are a lot of people out there that used to play Vanilla that probably have no clue that Classic is happening.  It'd at least be worth a three months subscription for a lot of those people to at least try the game.
---
On YouTube every three minutes I see ads for mobile games that I would guess don't generate nearly the sort of revenue that Classic will, so while I think the word is out there a bit, I'm confused why they don't do more about it.
---
Holy shit it is isn't it.
---
I could have sworn it wasn't at one point, though that being said it will still be awful EXP at level 55, most everything in there would be bright green and giving trivial EXP.
---
&gt; Clique if you prefer an addon instead of mouse over macros.
---
Imo a must have addon for healers.
---
Not only is it super convenient it also allows you to bind mouseover abilities to your mouse buttons which unless it was recently added to the game isn't possible with macros.
---
Sounds like the perfect time to squeeze in some super speedy flash heals.
---
Just get an infusion you casual
---
What is melee Leeway?
---
Race won't exclude you, but it may put you lower in priority all else being equal.
---
If you're attendance and consumables are on point you'll be perfectly fine regardless.
---
Represent!!
---
At least toast the bread first...
---
Enchanting is good, but to be profitable you'll have to stand in citys spamming your macro for long periods of time. Uhg. 
---
I would recommend herb, b/c from what ive seen a LARGE number of people are going skinning/mining, so herbs will be in demand.
---
Raiding will be fine, pvp dwarf would be better and more enjoyable because you have better self healing as a dwarf
---
Source? I can beleive it, but that's a little overboard.
---
My brother is rolling a troll warrior. Would it be possible to duo level with him as a warlock or hunter? Or should I just play shammy? I don’t have a problem with healing, but I heard that shammy pvp sucks and I want to do a lot of PVP during vanilla.
---
It does not matter what you pick unless you want to join an elite top 1% guild.
---
Respec caps at 50 which is a shit ton of gold.   Leveling a 2nd char takes a long time though.
---
😎 vanilla must be your favourite flavour 😎
---
I unfortunately got tendinitis in both elbows in BC. It never fully healed because I've never stopped gaming and play alot of guitar and piano. The first few years were the most painful until I went to physical therapy. 
---
Best advice: if you have physical therapy exercises do them before the pain starts. Staying ahead of the game is the best strategy. That way you don't have to rely on medication that'll eventually destroy your liver and kidneys that'll prevent future WOW gaming. 
---
Take breaks. After every dungeon, or hour of gameplay take a 5-15 minute break. It's the nonstop gaming that ultimately destroys you overtime. 
---
Lastly, have good posture. It's so easy to just relax and slouch in your chair. Especially when you're fishing, crafting, or farming herbs and ore. A little ergo goes a long way. 
---
Cya online friendo!
---
No no no. Sleep nourishes the mind. Without sleep your reaction speeds are lowered and you can’t game as well.
---
Food on the other hand nourishes the body. You don’t need legs to play games. All you need is a strong mind and fingers. This means if you don’t eat you can still game just as well. Take eating out of your schedule, you don’t need it to game.
---
RemindMe! 1 month
---
Required entirely depends on your guild. The more hardcore your guild is the more likely it is they will require engineering. 
---
Engineering is incredibly useful and you will be handicapping yourself without it.
---
And 'healer who can't rez' form
---
You can't tank without tank gear, yes. But he could use tank gear he didn't get with the guild.
---
Yes it's given to tank players, but how do you know they gave it to him if he wasn't a tank but a DPS player that switched occasionally.
---
You are making wild assumptions. His guild might be hardcore, might be semi or even casual. You can't know.
---
Why are you trying to insult me? You have no source, just guesses. I point it out and now I am the one who lacks common sense?
---
Best part about today: New episode!! Worst part about today: I only commute for 20 minutes so it will take me all week to finish it. Can't wait though!
---
I’m just fine.  Insults =/= upset.  Insults are just pointing out the obvious.  You know I didn’t say any of this, you just know you’re wrong so you’re making up arguments that never happened so you can get your internet win, which is quite pathetic.
---
Paladin for sure man. I played a pally to 60, then rolled a rogue; and my hands were aching.
---
It wasn’t all bad! Depends on play style for sure. Yeah the minis aren’t half bad, for what it’s worth.
---
No one said you had to get whirlwind axe at 30. it's still a very solid weapon at 36, when it's very much soloable. At 30, you can just run around with Corpsemaker, which frankly, is what I would be doing if I leveled fury anyways. 
---
And yes. Obviously, 2h axe spec (Which you should stay with at 40-45 at least) is going to mostly be relevant after 40, because.... you can't GET it until 35 unless you skip sweeping strikes. It's great from 35-45, which is very much when you can expect to have an axe and when you can expect to want to be arms.
---
None of this CAN prove anything, because your argument lacks the structure to even dismantle. 
---
You cannot dismantle people's feelings, and that's basically what you have. You are not supporting your analysis that arms doesn't have "much" in it's entire 6 first tiers of talent points, or that rend is bad. I have done what I can, responding to the theoretical arguments you MIGHT put forward.
---
But if the end result is that you feel that fury is better because you just feel it, regardless of any math on the subject? well, yeah. This is going to end with you feeling that fury is better. Obviously. And since you haven't put forward any math, I am pretty confident at this point that you don't have any. 
---
But I also feel that it is impossible for any competent reader to view your previous 3 posts and be convinced that fury is better. They either already believed that, or you have done absolutely nothing to convince them.
---
As someone who enjoys cooking and keeping his kitchen clean as well as sitting down to eat with loved ones, I'd say a two hour window is perfectly reasonable. But that's a long way from the pop-tart and Mountain Dew diet I suspect most of us to be subsisting on while playing Classic.
---
I would go with druid. Shaman are generally better off as ele resto for bgs, acting as offensive healers. Druid performs super well in pvp and pve as a resto balance spec. You're right that you wont be raiding ele resto for raids in ph. 1-2. It's not impossible, but you wont be supporting the raid nearly as much without deep resto.
---
That's sort of what I was thinking, Thanks!
---
That's called "tri-spec" and it's a really strong build. Just a bit challenging to play and to maximize your effectiveness. It's not the standard stand around and heal spec. You will be doing a lot of interrupting, mana burning, dispelling, etc. 
---
But if you wanted to run PI or deeper holy, you can still afford to dump only 5 points into blackout if you're a troll. Shadowguard + blackout is really just THAT good.
---
Frost mage pve and frost mage pvp are very different specs and both are bad at the other. The class that has the easiest time pvping and pveing in the same spec is probably lock. Also frost mage raid dps is literally pressing frostbolt until oom, evo, frostbolt til oom, wand
---
For me it's really:
---
1. Not having to rez people in raids (outside of brez, obv)
---
2. Very little competition for tier sets
---
3. Don't have to worry about being competitive on healing meters because it's known that druids are the weakest, HPS-wise
---
4. Lots of free feral gear
---
5. Potential of becoming dedicated feral offtank in raids
---
6. Can tank dungeons and heal raids (exactly what I love to do in vanilla)
---
7. Only have 1 buff to manage (other than thorns on 1-2 tanks)
---
8. Best tank while leveling
---
9. Most versatile tank (damage spells, healing spells, etc) makes for interesting playstyles
---
I had a druid as an alt on one of the pservers, and honestly loved it way more than my main (warrior). Can't wait to finally main druid.
---
Bosses can dodge from behind actually, they just can't parry
---
No, there is virtually no spec in the game that is considered best of the best in PVE and PVP for that class. The closest I can think of is 30/0/21 for shaman, but that's just a _passable_ raid healing spec, not at all top tier. 
---
Raid DPS in vanilla is weird. Most of the casters have rather boring, single button rotations. So, I guess you could argue that melee DPS (combat Rogue or Fury Warrior) is more fun simply by virtue of having different moves to use - but that's gonna be different from player to player.
---
I hate meters, because people start gaming them.
---
For example, people will see you're healing someone who needs it, so they'll throw in a fast heal so that theirs lands first - you overheal, they get "healing done". Or they just flash heal everything in sight.
---
Once it's actually a difficult fight, things get different. On my priest I'd often be in the bottom third for healing on farm fights (because I don't try to max the meter), but would usually be #1 or #2 for progression fights - because I was focusing on being mana efficient while still delivering the needed heals. In these same fights the previous top healers would be going OOM repeatedly, burning pots, runes, begging for innervate, mana tide, etc - and they'd get them. Despite this, I was still beating them for healing output.
---
It's frustrating, because a lot of the time we'd lose the fight because too many healers went OOM. If they'd been focusing on being efficient instead of trying to top the meter, that wouldn't have happened.
---
CAT DURID IS 4 FITE
---
In the case of any other class I'd say go for the race you want. When it comes to alliance priests however, the idea that dwarf priests are the only priests is prevalent enough that I would stop to think about it.
---
If you're a good healer, and get yourself established in the guild, sure you'll get to raid. It's still rather likely that healers are quite sought after so even if you aren't great and don't get yourself established early it might not be that big of a deal.
---
But.. As I said, the idea that dwarf priest is the only alliance priest is prevalent. So be aware that people will for raiding pick a dwarf over over Nelf all other things being equal. You might get some whining about not being a dwarf. But I find it hard to imagine there won't be guild to accept you as a non-dwarf. Might be more casual guilds though in general.
---
Haven’t posted about this yet, but as we draw closer. I can’t help but to keep thinking about what to roll. I played a hunter for Vanilla, but I was 10. I really didn’t know what I was doing. I would like to start over knowing how to actually play the class. However, I also want to branch out as well. I’m torn between Hunter, Shaman, and priest. I plan to PvP heavily, but want to experience raiding. Healing is something I’ve always wanted to try, and it seems like a good idea to start now.
---
Problem is that only half of the PvP gear is itemized for elemental. You'd be stuck wearing crappy dungeon blues in half the slots. You'll be putting in the same effort as the classes for whom all the gear is good but you only get half the reward, and you'll just underperform forever. If you're never gonna raid, pick a class for whom all the PvP gear is usable.
---
I know Dalaran was bigger but it took me forever to get to level 68 and Stormwind was always very crowded
---
Thinkpads are super modular. You can get all kinds of bells and whistles in them. But most companies order them without those kind of extras.
---
They really don't see it as a major thing like we do.
---
I think for the casual/semi-casual guilds, having someone that is knowledgeable of the class is good for people that are still learning their class. Despite what a lot of people here think, there are going to be a lot of people that aren't very knowledgeable about the game or their class. Yes, you can look up everything, but having someone that can help or point you in the right direction is useful. As far as being needed in raid leading, you're probably right.
---
Retail has a cash store
---
something more like 21/8/22 or [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305200104-320302002-05025303030012) are gonna be more pvp oriented than seal fate, no?
---
Respec caps at 50g, which is around 1-2 hours of gold farming at max level.
---
Good luck
---
Yup. I remember the original thread. Was hillarious.
---
Next time I’m at a book store, I’ll grab Rise of the Horde. Now that August is almost here, I can’t contain myself haha
---
ITT Reactions without critical thought.
---
All of this can be googled
---
Haven’t played mage but..
---
Hardcore guilds will have a dedicated frost mage for dmg buff while the rest are pve specced. If you’re in a relaxed guild you can probably raid with pvp spec, might not farm mc/bwl that easily early on but clear it every week nontheless before reset. Since it’s 16 debuff slots off the bat I dont think anyone will notice your frost pvp specced.
---
25% permanent stun resist is legit the best pvp racial in the game. It's not even really a contest.
---
&gt; My question is without dual spec will it be possible to max out my DPS in the top raids without going bankrupt
---
It depends on how much you want to play.  You can farm 50-70g /hr as a mage with solid gear. Dropping 100-200g a week is a tough pill to swallow though. If you want to be a top DPS, you will need to be a raid spec unfortunately.
---
No one mentionning lazypig?
---
Dwarf priest is so much more powerful than any other option due to FW that I would strongly recommend you choose it. It's essentially removing one of the better tools that a priest has available before you even start leveling your character. Your guild will love you for it as FW is useful in both PVP and PVE on a lot of fights,
---
Depends on preference, really. Daggers are better than some of the hemo folks seem to give them credit for, but you do sacrifice some control for burst. Hemo is, imo, just too boring to be worth it, and except for hard counters you can generally make due against any class a hemo rogue can. And dagger rogues with a CD or two up eat all but good mages alive, which is nice.
---
Tanked all of your 7 to 11 dungeons at lvl 55. With good enchanted gear and proper group combo. It can be done, in certain conditions. It is not the rule, ofc, I am just saying that it can be done.
---
But, generally speaking, it should be avoided to go in those dungeons as a lvl 55 tank, that will probably not going to have the best possible gear, enchants and a proper group composition.
---
Love this man! I'm glad this helped :) you won't regret it!
---
The lyceum? Could you elaborate what that is?
---
Logitech g600 is the way to go, goes on sale once in a while.
---
FWIW, I never said I was dreaming about something, I obviously know that they aren't going to change MC before release in a month.  So I won't be disappointed.    
---
For a lot of people what made vanilla great wasn't the actual raid of MC (mechanics, the bosses, the map), because by Blizzard's own admission they knocked it out in a week in a rush.  It's just not good.  The fact that the idea of a boss having even slightly different mechanics makes people angry (not you, I'm talking about others on this reddit) just strikes me as odd.  I mentioned this in another post but I saw someone complaining about the new Mail system and how "Blizzard needs to fix that shit before August 27th" and I just shake my head.  Mailing your alt 10 separate emails instead of dragging and dropping 10 stacks of Mageweave into a single mail item didn't make Vanilla great.    
---
There's a known "creative use of mechanics" on the Onyxia fight to allow guilds to farm it during a single lockout, should that stay in the game?  I think _most_ sane players would say know, but now we're making changes to code that existed before.  But "fixing" that (again, its not broken, it's well within the rules of the game) won't diminish the experience of 99% of the player base who wouldn't use those tactics, but it's a change none-the-less.
---
Deep Rock Galactic
---
Ah the infamous horde guild that always a perfect raid composition.  Mr feral van be grouped with the main tank for more threat.
---
The people in suits won't care because they make money, but everyone who put effort into designing 8.2 and eventually 9.x will probably be just a little mad that they're being out done by a 2005 game.
---
This is the first evidence I've seen that says this.
---
I have tried out quite a few of their expansions entirely too optimistically just to unsubscribe after about 45 days from their release dates;I remember them boasting about their 14 millions subscribers in vanilla/tbc day- wonder if we will get up into the millions and what longevity we can sustain; any predictions when the hype will die down? I think we will see new players revert to their easier games they know and love in a 2 month span but that a large chunk will want to play for a year + pending on blizzs effort to maintain servers integrity (economy is a big one) 
---
I personally will be signing my wife up to see how she likes it but don’t expect her to get past level 30 before I find her reverting back to some clash royale or stardew valley

If you and your target are moving, your melee range goes up a couple yards.
---
OOMKIN form too :D
---
Yeah thanks for that, it doesn't factor in opinion.
---
Also finding a UI with all that utility I'd have to test the add-ons. I don't have beta so I can't.
---
Thanks for the help though, I'm glad that you've shown me Google, what would I do without you. 
---
*facepalm*
---
I’ve read some of the books they are soooooo good. Maybe you appreciate and enjoy playing wow soo much more.
---
Hey, hey, hey. Druids can rez. Not everyone, and not right away, but we rez.
---
Meh, CB is overrated, imo. The extra tool to get out of slows or a snare is a lifesaver.
---
Getting a dwarf into full plate gear and healing in PVP sounds like such a blast to me. Dwarves just look awesome as angry little chunks of metal. I'm really torn between that aethetic and playing a dwarf rogue.
---
Doesn’t eat while playing? What a casual
---
Really? Realllly?
---
Better solution : remove work instead
---
I’ve heard it does and it doesn’t, I don’t recall from way back.
---
No we just wouldnt being feral druids lmao. 
---
They were trash tier dps anyway lmao.
---
yeah I know! especially when TBC releases and you set foot into Draenor &lt;3
---
Eat less time. More time for wow AND weight loss. It's a win-win!
---
&gt; You are not supporting your analysis that arms doesn't have "much" in it's entire 6 first tiers of talent points, or that rend is bad. I have done what I can, responding to the theoretical arguments you MIGHT put forward.
---
No you haven't done much either, it's just your feelings, you aren't putting out any hard numbers. Your argument basically boils down to "if you are in a group sweeping strikes is nice" and "hamstring can crit too". It's feelings as well. So... pot, kettle, black.
---
And, honestly, reddit isn't EJ, and quite frankly I don't have the time to educate people. Ultimately people will level as they want.
---
Druid bros!

Retail bad, classic gud.

No one has mentioned Bejeweled for long flight paths.
---
"SUM DURIDS IS MOON KIN"

"Them 1s is look all funny liek maybe form MOON! LOL!"
---
Detroit Metro area here...Def down for a guild or something.
---
Decursive essentially serves no purpose these days (arguably it's been pointless since 2.0). People should just use WeakAuras or a healing interface.
---
Yes all of these are really good, I'd also highly recommend The Last Guardian as well. That one and Arthas rise of the lich king is by far my favorites.
---
Well it’s quite literally video evidence.  People just love to bitch is what it comes down to.
---
Healers don't have a hard time getting raid invites in general so if you're set on being a NE I'd just say go for it! Dwarf is undeniably better but any priest is still an asset and there will like be enough Dwarf ones around anyway.
---
Great to see you at least dropped the topic of the argument now and are resorting to trolling.  At least it lets me know that YOU know you’re wrong.  That’s a small step for you in this conversation I guess.
---
&gt; carpal tunnel symptoms

+ wrist pain at night that interferes with sleep.

Considering the tech was invented to help the servers run better that's just not true

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ch1rmi/some_questions_about_feral_ranking/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
The three addons I cant live without are WIM, Bagnon, and Prat.
---
WIM makes whispers pop up in a little instant messenger window. Bagnon just makes your bags look like one bag and has search/sorting features. Part I mostly use because it colors player names in chat to match their class color. It also allows you to copy links from chat. 
---
I used to also use this addon that I made through trial and error basically. It would play a little "ba-dum" sound when someone said something in guild chat. I would love one that only makes the noise when people say my characters name or a variation of my name.
---
PvP but only because my friends are. I'd go with PvE if I were solo mostly because I play healers
---
We just have to watch out for those who get a liiiiittttllllleeee ambitious :)
---
Disgusting
---
It's not. I remember using Hearthstone will being /sit during Vanilla espacially on a UD :)
---
He thinks they should. But they shouldn't.
---
All these came out after classic though... Cycle of Hatred not even here and it's the most relevant book leading up to classic wow.
---
Is there a specific order?
---
But being able to fly over everything shrinks it further
---
Personally: discomfort up the forearms and hands. Includes burning sensation, pins and needles sensation, soreness.
---
For me, it's moreso RSI (repetitive strain injury). Related to carpal tunnel in some way. Probably from too much computer and too few breaks.
---
Yes, I’ll take it with the Classic TBC launch in the early fall of 2021.
---
&gt;  Great to see you at least dropped the topic of the argument
---
Oh my... Now you're calling it an argument.
---
Everything about you is an "argument" and all about "winning". That's such a depressing, terrible, antagonistic mindset to have.
---
&gt; At least it lets me know that YOU know you’re wrong.
---
Why is that the first thing that pops into your mind? Why are you so obsessed with this idea of winning or losing? Is this a common theme in your life? 
---
Eventually as you get older you will learn that you don't have to be so aggressive and treat everything like a contest or battle.
---
Life is too short to have such a poisonous mindset. I really hope you see that one day.
---
Nah, you just want to lick Blizzards boots and can't think for yourself
---
THAT IS A LOT OF EATING...
---
That's absolutely not the case. Yes if you're trying to push higher keys players will be incredibly elitist but if you're just trying to do low to mid keys it's very easy to get groups.
---
Gerber Kawasaki's fund owns over $22 million worth of shares in DIS...the market cap of which is over $253 billion (.0087%). For all intents and purposes, their opinion is about as relevant to Disney as mine is (hint: they don't care). 
---
EA would be a much more likely purchase but I don't see Disney making any major acquisitions in this area.
---
You know what they say about opinions...
---
I subscribed last week. Thought I might enjoy some BfA while I'm waiting for Classic. Logged into my Druid (haven't played since Cata, still level 85 with full Ruthless PvP gear), tanked one Timewalking dungeon, and realized I couldn't do it. Private servers ruined retail for me. Classic is just that much better.
---
TLDR: Subbed but not playing.
---
It's not needed per se but it is a very good idea so many raiding guilds will have them - no doubt about that.

Leveling will go much quicker if you get Enh talents as nothing in the resto tree boosts your damage.  If you're intent on resto, focus on joining a large active leveling guild and try to run dungeons and get the appropriate quests as often as you can, or make friends with similar-level melee DPS classes and do some quests together. 
---
PVP-
---
Drop WF totem a lot, and arrange to have yourself put into the same group with warriors or rogues
---
Grounding totem is obvious, but don't forget other defensive totems like stoneskin/ poison cleanse or searing totem.  Stoneskin can save a lot of HP over a long fight or vs druid / rogue / hunter (hunter pet does a good amount).  Searing totem can prevent loss of combat which helps a rogue restealth or a warr get another charge.  
---
Poison cleansing totem is a great one to drop as it prevents a lot of rogue tricks and also gets rid of viper sting which is a big PVP annoyance
---
Tremor totem is vital vs locks or priests!  
---
Basically, whatever class you're engaging against always has 1 or 2 totems you should try to drop asap.  Whether you drop offensive or defensive totems is always based on teammates near you.  Generally if I'm alone I just drop defensive totems of course to try and stay alive until someone rescues me. 
---
Use rank 1 shocks unless you have a chance to kill the target, you'll benefit from the utility and save your mana to sustain yourself. 
---
Don't forget to re-drop totems, many PVP fights are very mobile and totem range is relatively small even with the resto talent to boost it. 
---
Resto shaman is a great PVP support class overall but takes time to learn which totems to use at which time and be able to spit them out without devoting much thought to it.
---
I remember seeing these back in vanilla but folks were getting banned for it. Something something TOS? I have no idea what the exact restriction was, but folks were getting reported and vanishing from my friends list (won me a couple silvers, lost a couple more).
---
Oh now you’re bringing age into this, you’re adorable honey.  I’m probably twice your age.  Trust me sweet heart you have got a lot of learning to do.
---
 You are not *actually* being serious right now, are you? You say "take an item the group was expecting to go elsewhere". 
---
Yes, I am serious. HOW the group determines who needs the loot is IRRELEVANT, which you seem to NOT UNDERSTAND. Read the title of the tread again and tell me again how any of what you're saying even matters.
---
They confirmed it on their own forum, lol.
---
[https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4282](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4282)
---
Aye you do indeed have a 'rez'
---
Rogues can pickpocket brd for money.
---
What’s the point of being on a forum then? A place where you talk to others, and not by yourself.
---
But this game doesn't appeal to the instant gratification generation of gamers, can you imagine a 12 year old who always gets everything easy and within the first hours of the game waiting for 4 freaking weeks to finally get an item he desires and lets not even talk about all items he needs/wants. yeah nope not gonna happen.
---
That’s only optimal for group pve
---
The eat. And by eat I mean take a big bite at first then slowly devour you bit by bit :). 
---
HOTW spec with an emphasis on cat form is fantastic damage output if you know what you’re doing. Especially for phase one and two where you’re world pvping and will get openers on MOST classes. And if you don’t, you can run away and come back to get the opener. 
---
In WSG and later phases you’re right. Flag running spec won’t put out much damage. But in early phases HOTW is the go to. And it can eat :)
---
Be a Night Elf. If you're a good player you can make anything work. That's my opinion and I'm rolling a NE warrior even though "zomg humans have +5 wep skill NE is worthless". Everyone says play what you want but really like play what you want. If someone doesn't want you because you're an elf, that's literally racist. You'll be fine.
---
Yes sorry you are correct I was thinking of the similar effect but what I actually meant was the UD priest have that buff but it only applies when hit with melee. Touch of Weakness, which is like a crappy combo of shadow guard/ hex of weakness.... in that it does some damage and makes them do less damage.
---
Totally understand man, I have to agree that feral TBC druid was the most fun I've had playing druid as well!
---
He'll be fine if he isn't a mage warlock paladin haha
---
Why do you think this is a problem? This obviously won’t happen lol
---
Im getting mres for classic
---
Okay now compare to Redoubt Cloak.
---
22 Agi is over 1% dodge. 1% dodge is roughly equal to 7 defense unless you are going for def cap. But, you also get over 1 crit, even better with kings.  You also gain 56 armor (Assuming no kings or ZG buff), 6 FR, 6 NR and lose 3 stamina. 
---
This is a better mitigation cloak than Redoubt, and you get 1 crit on top of it. This is a significant upgrade for a tank, and a minor upgrade for a hunter.
---
Tanks make use of every single aspect of the stats on this cloak.
---
Right. But there's a difference between role leads like mDPS Officer, rDPS Officer, Healing Officer, etc.. and Class Leads like Paladin Lead, Priest Lead, Druid Lead all being in charge of their class raiders and referring to the main Healing Officer.
---
&gt;doling out healing assignments, interupts for critical events, drag trash here, do x, do y is a little much for one person(RL) 
---
Right. But one person alone wouldn't be doing that. It'd be a collaboration of the RL, MT, OT(s), Healing O, mDPS O, and rDPS O.
---
Just not all of the above PLUS  a Paladin Leader, Priest Leader, Hunter Leader, Rogue Leader, Mage Leader and so on and so forth.
---
Low-energy Jeb doing it again
---
I'm not going to be rolling druid in classic (because I capped a druid on a private server recently) but they are extremely versatile and fun to play. Don't underestimate feral dps in raiding at 60 either. I was regularly top 5 dps outdoing mages, warriors, and rogues in 40 mans. You'll be spending some time on consumables though.
---
Shaman vs Priest vs Rogue
---
Just want to be overall useful. Decent in PvP, easy to find spots in dungeons/raids, not a bad solo life. 
---
I also typically like playing the least popular class, not for any particular reason, just because, although there is no way I'm playing a druid.
---
Well I guess enjoy Vanilla with Classic then and hope TBC Classic is a thing then?
---
Won't be my problem.
---
The world just needs to not end before 6:00pm EST on August 26th, 2019.  Success guaranteed.
---
Anything like this for hunters?
---
Please don't use sexist terms like honey and sweetheart.
---
Just because you are upset does not give you a free pass to speak down to women. Are you racist too? Do you want to call me the N word too just because I'm a black woman? Will that make you feel better?
---
I can't believe you would really stoop to this level, just because you are so obsessed with winning an argument on the internet.
---
This entire ordeal has made me so depressed that there are people really living their lives like this. I really hope you find peace and can learn to let go of this anger one day.
---
Your opinion. I called for help many of times and help came. Getting ganked in red ridge?..... go somewhere else. Evolve, adapt, don’t just cry about it. You sound like the whiney guy in chat that bitches about everything so that may be why no one ever came to your rescue. PvP server rule number 1 - always assume there is an enemy close and never pull more than you can handle. At the small chance someone attempts to gank you, you can somewhat be prepared. players stop giving honor after so many kills. So, you may die to a 60 @ 50 a couple times, get over it. Take the ass beating and move on. 
---
Don’t listen to this guy. Some of the most random, spontaneous pvp events will erupt and you will never forget them. Even if it’s not that often that seems worth it to me. Some people like to live life without ever taking risks. What fun is that... it’s World of Warcraft. In a pve server it’s more like World of /Wavecraft.
---
Who works this much...? Or who sleeps this little?
---
Thanks a lot man, glad you liked it. Personally i felt like i was always disappointing when i found a rare in terms of loot, and decided to look into if there are those who drop higher end stuff in particular.
---
All the low level alliance zones through wetlands. Cant wait to alt-oholic my way to 5 level 30s lol
---
Those lists already exist for the most part, there's tons of pre-raid and phase based bis lists (and no one really cares about pre-60 gear that aren't on pre-raid bis lists so you could set those ratings systematically).
---
Alternatively you could simply have the ratings based off player stats. How much hit/crit/primary stat, regen etc.
---
back in vanilla I was with a druid passing through Elwyn Forrest when we decided to stop by Hogger to mind control him and buff him up with Mark, Thorns and Fortitude before going on our way.

I have NEVER been banned or even suspended for using auto click programs. Shit many keyboards and mice come with this feature in their software now. To be clear I'm always present at my computer so I'm not botting, but I have used these programs in the past to compete against others when it comes to world items that need clicking, like this one Easter egg quest one year.
---
Those discussions always just devolve into "Why you should always and only ever pick orc" on the horde side...
---
Yup! Best time to do it waiting on zhevera hooves
---
Warlock and hunter can easily pair up with any class, warlock having more group utility between the two.   
---
Shaman + warrior is a pretty great combo, as a warrior benefits from heals and totems a ton. Shamans shine in group PvP as ele or resto. So many ways to help your team with totems. Nature's swiftness gives you great burst or healing, earth shock is amazing against casters, not to mention PURGE, and chain lightning is one of the most fun spells to cast in the game. The only shammy that sucks in PvP is enhancement memes.
---
Book added in TBC
---
For sure, no problemo friendo.
---
Haven't seen anyone mention it but your voidwalker aoe taunt can get rogues out of stealth if you can land it on them.
---
good catch, i don't want to be a source of misinformation.
---
 :)
---
It also sounds like you need to brush up on your pvp. Get good?
---
Its sad that most people dont do something they love statistically and lose over half of their personal time to work, even when studies show the 8 hour day is no longer needed or efficient
---
I personally didn't enjoy the Warcraft 2 novelizations, and I have a feeling I wouldn't like any other Aaron Rosenberg book. Very boring characters, no depth, no personality. Think the deepest emotions I saw out of the 3 main characters (Turaylon, Alleria, Khadgar) were concern, anger, and doubt. Khadgar could be a little sarcastic at times, which is nice, but that was about it. He can depict large battles though, those were kind of cool. 
---
*Rise of the Horde* is solid, and it gets overall positive reviews from Warcraft fans. 
---
I'm ashamed to say (as a lore nerd) I haven't gotten around to reading *Arthas,* and I get a lot of mixed reviews on it. At they very least it appears to have made some weird decisions with Arthas' personality and some aspects seemingly got retconned by WotLK's final story path.
---
Disney injected 'woke' politics into Star Wars, which made their movies far more cringey than the prequels. The prequels were bad in a more traditional way.
---
Agreed, thanks to some private server discoveries over the years things like MCP can really make a feral druid pull some respectable numbers in raids. Personally, I don't think  I would do this. But for those die-hard feral raiders, it gives them an opportunity to prove themselves. Not to mention the Leader of the Pack buff was nice too
---
Fresh pasta takes 1-3 minutes.
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
---
I'll watch when I get home, since I can't really at work right now. But I think the biggest thing that people underestimate is really the potential to be the swiss army knife of classes in classic. You can DPS, tank or heal all out of one spec (sure not better than a dedicated class could do one of those things, but you can do it just fine). And the ability to master all 3 in the classic days was so rare, it was truly magnificent to see a druid that was able and willing to fill whatever was needed in the group.
---
Depends what you want to do at endgame, but hunter, warlock and priest are fairly easy going while levelling. Efficiency is the name of the game, so hunters is just sending pet and autoshot, maybe a couple of shots. Warlock + priest you frontload a nuke/dots and wand while mana regens.
---
Not even mentioning paladin because it's too obvious. :)
---
I love both classes which is why it's hard!  In Classic, Hunter is probably a bit more fun dps wise cause the 16 debuff slot limit in raids means largely spamming shadowbolt on a warlock.
---
I definitely like warlock gear looks more, but some of the hunter sets look nice as well.
---
The one thing making me lean Hunter today (surprise, I was almost dead set on warlock yesterday) is the chance to get Lok'delar and Rhok'delar again.  I have them on my BfA hunter and getting to experience that again would be great.
---
Well looks like you already have it figured out, if you don't want to PVE you basically heal dungeons with your elemental spec and once you're done you just start pvping for the pvp set. 
---
You'll need minimum rank 10 though in order to even compete with the raiders.
---
4 books in 5 weeks is child's play for people who actually read.

Opium, crucial for wPvp, allows you to create a Kill On Sight list of players, or guilds.
---
Didn’t know you’re a woman nor do I give a shit if you are, ignorant is ignorant regardless of color or sex.
---
The difference is not negligible. Pally buffs are just way too good for feral tank/dps (10% stats from kings, Blessing of Wisdom for more powershifts, Salv if you go too ham on DPS, Blessing of Might). Meanwhile you don't get Windfury as cat. Alliance is objectively the best faction for PvE Druids.
---
For professions: I'd save enchanting for max level, using Skinning/Tailoring while leveling for mount money (Can make bags and cloth is abundant as a druid since you don't use First Aid during leveling). Then at max level drop both, pick up Enchanting/Mining and get Smoking Heart, then drop enchanting and get engineering. This is the "optimal" path though, don't HAVE to do this. After max Engi you can drop mining and do w/e or if you really want to keep enchanting you can level Mining/Skinning and stockpile enough ore to be able to max Engi after dropping Mining so that you could be Ench/Engi.

Wait. Considering you still don't get it, I re-read your comments. Do you think we're talking about his old guild and what happened there? We are not.
---
We are talking about Classic and what he can do to prevent being asked to tank. That was his question. 
---
If he passes on tank gear in his Classic guild, they won't ask him to tank. Problem solved.
---
So you were just accidentally sexist? Are you accidentally racist too? Is that what you tell the people you disrespect? "Sorry, I'm just accidentally sexist sometimes?"
---
You sure there aren't any other sexist or racist comments you can come up with to help you feel like you won this "argument"?
---
Are you really that desperate to "win" that you have to stoop to this level? Absolutely disgusted right now.
---
Only problem with that is you’re flagged and they are not.... so they will not attack you if they cannot win.
---
thats awesome thanks.  Hoping i can find one for our tank
---
Honest question as I tried looking into it a bit... why are you so hyped?
---
Looking purely at DPS, even with the Hit chance factored in, dual-wield and 2h output roughly the same amount while levelling. The reason 2h is heavily favored is because hamstring kiting doesn't work for dual-wield to reduce downtime, and Sweeping Strikes is a nice damage burst. Coupled with /sit exploiting not triggering enrage, for solo levelling Arms will generally outperform fury purely due to the difference in downtime.
---
However, for anyone who is duo-levelling with a healer or for those who find people to group with while questing/levelling (almost everyone should be able to at launch), the talents in Fury deliver more than those in Arms (in a group you can easily pull multiple mobs which should significantly increase Enrage uptime without needing exploits if you have agro). At that point, the first rule of levelling as warrior remains the most important: Get the best weapon you can. 
---
If I were levelling solo I'd agree with you and focus on 2h. However since I have a pocket healer, dual-wielding is certainly viable and with the guaranteed weapon upgrades it's significantly easier to keep my weapons up-to-date.
---
*The you are truly lost
---
45% rend damage is like 13 damage over 12 seconds on a rank 2 rend. Or you can have 5 crit.
---
Resubbed - watching the arena world championship series and then the race to world first mythic EP got the WoW juices flowing hard again. 
---
Also my brother finally bought his first ever pc and wanted to try retail before classic comes out so we’ve been enjoying leveling together, and I’ve been doing the new 8.2 content on my 12 troll priest. 
---
Been having way more fun with it than I anticipated, and now will probably play both retail and classic once it’s out!
---
True anyone citing critics as "evidence" their opinion is correct is retarded. The disney sw is not even star wars on any level. Its something else.
---
Yeah, yours is wrong.
---
Bro it takes like 2 seconds of opening the Blizzard launcher to check. Not to mention the answer is easily Googled AND it's common sense - of course they're not going to make you download an entirely separate retail client to play Classic.
---
I was just going trough my saved posts and came across your previous post. 
---
It's great to see the addon is still in development. 
---
From what I've seen your addon looks absolutely great so far and kinda like a spiritual successor to the once great TourGuide. (Maybe you remember it from the TBC/WOTLK days)
---
Anyways, thank you for giving back to the community.  I'm very much looking forward to use your addon next month. :)
---
Resto/ele shaman
---
Ima chargin mah fireball!!
---
The way I see is is that you have so many options to get out of slows/snares. You have FAP, spider belt(root) 2x vanish and if ally you should be gnome, do you really need a 5th-6th ?

Priest.  In wand we trust.

Classic WoW: *Exist*
---
Me: I'm actually perfectly alright with this
---
Much appreciated man, I had a blast and it was one hell of a duel for sure. I actually did a review video of that duel from my perspective on the YouTube channel if you're interested!
---
Yeah I'm intrigued by the significance of quest givers reportedly being absent. In early vanilla there was only the smaller camp, Valor's Rest. Cenarion's Hold and most of the rest of the zone did not exist at all.
---
This is a really cool idea
---
Yep. I hate meters for that reason. People forget that it's a team game and fuck over the team to max their own numbers
---
Yo at the end of the day it’s a business offering a service... that’s just the way the world works.
---
Also you keep using the word morale incorrectly.
---
Awesome video!  I absolutely plan on rolling a Druid.  I leveled a Druid back in original vanilla.  But I didn’t PvP.  Going PvP this time.
---
Also, can you give a direct link to your YouTube channel?  I’d like to “like” and subscribe.
---
Dude is delusional lol
---
Holy fuck you couldn’t get dumber in this argument HAHAHH.  Listen to yourself, no really read what you just wrote and reflect on how you managed that thought to leave your mind.
---
I am pretty sure druid will be much more popular this time around. They will likely decrease in popularity by P2 or 3 with rerolls when people realized that they are more difficult to play than the average character.
---
A lot of guilds are still looking for rogues.  They will be one of the top dps classes through all the content.
---
But they may be attacking if they think they have a chance, which would lead to a more or less fair fight if it happens
---
Ethical*
---
I like this video, but why shit on greens when Tidal Charm is so fucking great? Also your pronunciation of Alterac is very odd.
---
Just try to log in.
---
Wat?
---
To echo what Quince said, with dudu you can resto for both but with shaman you really wanna go ele(more specifically 30-0-21) for pvp
---
I've always mained a rogue, but my guild has quite a few rogues signed up and no hunters. Does the following plan make any sense?
---
* Play hunter to 60 and progression raid with him.
---
   * easier leveling experience than a rogue, solid dps for mc/ony/bwl/zg
---
* Bring a rogue up to 60 
---
   * use hunter gold farming to "twink" him along the way to make leveling easier
---
* raid progression with hunter while bringing rogue along on farmed content where other rogues don't need gear as much
---
I never raided with an alt before, I've always been 100% focused on a rogue main. How bad is it to level to 60 twice in vanilla? At what point do people start bringing in alts for raid gear? Ex: by the time AQ opens, should I be able to do mc/ony/bwl/zg on my rogue?
---
The spec you linked is kind of bad but it's pretty similar to a spec rogues use in high end WSG premades: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboZGccbrZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboZGccbrZVMjcc0R)
---
wouldnt use this if your goal is to 1v1 or solo play though, only if you're ranking together with a premade.
---
Woa, thanks for the reply. 
---
For leveling, I’ve gathered a group:  rogue, druid (tank), mate and priest. Will probably dps or if my buddy priest wants to pew pew I’ll heal. However, enha is ok for healing while lvling yeah?
---
Downranking shocks is really clever!
---
I think some of these might be difficult to find or you'll get multiple versions. I think it all depends on what patch the game is on. Searching for specifics like pre raid BIS, BWL bis, ect might produce better results
---
Actually, a lot of the things Mr McQuaid talked about on the podcast. The sense of community, the feeling of having to rely on a group to get things done, and a character that I can play for years and still need to work on. I want a 'slower' combat system that rewards critical thinking and timing and being aware of your surroundings and comboing your abilities with your group instead of just pressing your rotation. 
---
I'm a bit of a younger gamer (late 20s) and played wow as soon as it came out, but never got into EQ or DOAC or anything like that. I just feel like that's the type of game I'm looking for now and I hope I'm right.
---
1. Frost ~~shock~~**SHAWWWWKKKKK**.
---
2. Purge.
---
3.  Ghost Wolf
---
I would be absolutely thrilled if EPL was in its pre revamp state during Phase 1. I have been looking for screenshots or footage from pre-Naxx Light's H.o.pe (where the chapel was around, but not the tents) and there seems to be absolutely none around. 
---
It is essentially a minor but missing part of vanilla history.
---
I'd be cool with it. I highly doubt they'd poke their noses into the video game side of things. The things I could see them doing I'd be on board with - better movies and themed lands in their parks.
---
I’m a near 40 yo white dude and have absolutely no issues with the new series and it’s arc.  
---
End of the day, it’s a fucking space western!  Why do  neckbeards freak out that the lead is a woman and the supporting cast is diverse?
---
Hunter is probably the least button spammy class there is at least in terms of pve content. Hunters relies more on smart pet control and timing aimed shot precisely so it's actually a lot higher skillcap than other classes. In a dps scenario you pretty much only press 2 buttons per 10 seconds. 
---
Another options might be healers because essentially healing is moving around your mouse and clicking, but I don't know what you have the most issues with, spamming buttons repeatably or moving around the mouse and clicking al ot.
---
Are you sure? Unless you're talking about left and right click, I feel like you could already bind mouse 3 and 4 to mouse over macros in vanilla.
---
Sylvanas as a Disney Princess soon
---
Having separate class/role channels where officers are coordinating assignments and dealing with shit like distributing consumables or other small issues helps keep order and avoid headaches too. Trying to do all that in a single discord chat with 40 people is madness.
---
Neither, unless you are in a crap guild who does not care. Resto shaman is going deep resto and unless your guild wants you to tank and heal in the raid on the same night, you are speccing deep into restoration for your druid as well.
---
Do you remember if there were tents around the chapel, or just the chapel and FP?
---
Wow you're right, being disgusted by sexism is so dumb!
---
Just get it over with. Call me the N word, tell me I belong in the kitchen, tell me I should quit going to school for STEM because women like me are "too stupid". 
---
Please, I encourage it. At least be blatant enough so people know exactly what you are without having to have the ear for your racist dog whistles.
---
Like some subs I would understand, but really seeing someone resort to sexism and racism on a VIDEOGAME subreddit because they are desperate to "win" a made up "argument"....? Are you actually serious right now?
---
This is a new low for me. I will be reporting your comments for sexism. I really hope no other women fall prey to your disgusting behavior.
---
If you're using them like candy you're doing it wrong.
---
A big part of healing effectively is being mana efficient
---
+1 for The Food Lab! Consistently incredible meals from that book/blog. The meatball recipe is time consuming, but oh so worth it.
---
Made pasta earlier this week for some before gym carbo loading, takes me (dunno bout y'all) but takes me about 8-10 minutes to cook up some noodles
---
But.....when you sub, it's a month from that day you sub...right? So it's the same amount of money regardless, because it's 30 days of game time and not just till the end of the month....Am i really that stupid and just not understand what's being said here?
---
I have yet to see a "rares you should go out of your way to check for because the items they drop are actually valuable or useful" list. This would include Twink items, unique useful items, and maybe even rares that drop greens that are useful at end-game because of their disenchant value. If there is one, I'd love to have a link, if not, I think the brevity in your video style would make a good method of conveying this information.
---
Crap you are right! I completely forgot. Some points can be shuffled around. The main appeal of this build to me is being able to give kings to druid tanks and sanctuary to your warrior tanks while keeping nightfall up.
---
Yeah, I considered it briefly. But I'm not a huge fan of their animations/appearance
---
Or the drive home.
---
I hope you aren’t thinking of respecting too often if you go Priest!
---
Bro u realize how shitty computers were in 2004??? Literally ANY computer u can possibly imagine will run classic.. I remember when I was a kid in classic i saved up and bought this horrid computer from a thrift store.. This thing had 2 be from the 90s.. And it was slow as fuck. But still technically played the game.. I'd take a boat.. And tbe load screen was so long by the time it finished. The boat would be back the way i came from and hit the loading screen again and id just be stuck goijg back and forth in loading screens .. Ahhh.. Good memories. Rofl.
---
Shadowmeld + Mind Control = the most fun you can have on a priest character. NElf Priest is the best combo.
---
Oh right well TIL
---
I'd still say when in doubt go for the higher rank
---
Also, because all horde are nothing more than brutes.
---
Thanks a lot !!
---
Ok I guess i'll just contact blizzard... I'd like my 15years chars to move in to the us with me aswell\^\^
---
If I can't well, whatever i'll start fresh, I don't want to play with ping (even tho it would be a more realistic version of wow classic\^\^) and in a different timezone!
---
Dungeon finder tool was added way later in the expansion, almost near the end. Kinda surprises me that people harp on it as much as they do, like it overshadowed everything awesome in wotlk.
---
It's only about three fiddy a week to secure your names. You are so right I spend just as much on a cup of coffee
---
Pretty sure there is a warrior class restriction on all rage pots anyway
---
People whos going to sub at 13th just to reserve their names, please try to discover what server streamers are going to, I kinda of have a list of nicknames from people that are from streamers guilds so you can try to create their characters to see if they are going to roll on your server, I wont be able to do that at 13th because i'll be at work, but let me know if you want the list I have, I'd appreciate it if you actually try it.
---
Rogue One was just another boring B-grade Hollywood action movie in my books. Terrible story and terrible characters with too much focus on flashy action scenes and superficial fan service bullcrap (see: those Vader scenes at the end that people praise). I don't see what you people see in that movie, I hated it coming out of the theater almost as much as I hated The Last Jedi.
---
Maybe rather than focusing on finding the most boring class, you could focus on improving your ergonomic situation so you can play what you want with less stress on the wrists.

Get a mouse with a lot of side-buttons, so you can access all your abilities with just your right thumb.  I'm assuming thumb movement may exacerbate carpal tunnel symptoms less then all the keyboard stretching and whatnot, so if your left hand is only doing WASD, and the thumb on spacebar and alt (since alt is a modifier that lets you effectively double the keybinds you can access with your right thumb, same with ctrl, but reaching ctrl with the pinky is much harder on your wrists then alt is with the thumb), your fingers won't be wiggling around near as much.  Your index finger is happier if all it s tasked with is pressing D and E (and maybe R, F, C) rather than reaching over to 5 and stuff even further to the left.
---
Also important, make sure your desk set-up is ergonomic.  A high quality chair is good for the back of course, but aside from that, for carpel tunnel specifically, is that it's [very important your keyboard be at the proper height](https://ergonomicsfix.com/calculate-ideal-heights-for-your-ergonomic-office-desk-chair-keyboard/). A straight wrist is a happy wrist.
---
You're going to be sitting at a desk at home for many years to come - spend the money you need to to ensure it's comfortable and won't exacerbate or lead to any chronic injuries.
---
You've got a whole month to shop around for mice, wrist rests, keyboard trays (try [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/449987250/custom-keyboard-tray-reclaim-wood-desk?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;frs=1) over amazon if you want something sturdy with larger, custom dimensions), chairs (a refurb of a typically expensive chair is far better than something new at a similar price point), and desks.
---
I don't remember the plebs they remember me.
---
Not worth it to you? That's fine, everyone has different priorities. Just don't play. But no, they shouldn't lower the price and they have no reason to. 
---
You know a team has been working diligently on recreating this experience for us, right? Is their work worth nothing to you? It's not just a "10+ year old game," it's a game that basically no longer existed being integrated into a new client with vastly different architecture. 
---
Asking Blizzard to essentially just charge us server maintenance costs after people have worked hard on re-creating this experience for us is a bit rude. They need to recuperate development costs and they definitely deserve to turn a decent profit if the game does well. I think some investors might also raise some eyebrows if Blizzard started majorly under-charging for a popular game....
---
I thought classic was going to run on the modern client?
---
Would a GS addon scan my items in the bags?
---
Because I frequently use different items for certain pulls and bosses.
---
Would a GS scan my consumables and my willingness to use them?
---
Would a GS scan my 2 years Vanilla experience from 2005-2006, and the more recent Vanilla experience on pservers for another 2 years?
---
Tanks and healers are a RARE breed in Vanilla...will any GS user simply refuse a tank or a healer because of his GS? Do you think that there will be crowds of tanks and healers battling for a spot in a 5 men run or a PuG raid?
---
Would a GS scan the ability of a Mage to be on spot with CC and decursing? Or a Hunter's ability to kite?
---
Yes, a GS addon CAN be made for Vanilla, however, it will not be used by the VAST majority of players, which will make it irrelevant.
---
Simply because there are a multitude of factors that are far more important than any GS addon : your guildmates, your friends, your friend's friends, your experience, multiple gear usage, consumables, your ROLE (wanna bet that tanks and healesr will get an invite REGARDLESS of their gear?).
---
oh fursure b
---
Unironically this actually. Not in the "just quit your job to play video games" way, but rather "we should be moving in the direction of freeing people up to spend thier time doing something other than selling thier labor for the sake of basic human survival" way.
---
Oh God, I totally forgot about that one.
---
It does. /u/puggylol doesn't know what he's talking about. You'll be more than fine with the iMac. I wouldn't even bother with the RAM upgrade unless you have reasons outside WoW for it.
---
Oh i dunno. Eithwr way. The specs u listed will play the game totally fine.. I'd bet money on the lowest settings u will be getting 60 fps
---
Sure, but we're not talking about someone playing the class optimally. We're talking about someone playing the class with the least amount of effort possible because of an injury.
---
Would Engineering/Skinning be viable?
---
definitely not essential, but I hope i can get a working version of Baud Manifest
---
It's a chronic condition I've had for over a year. I understand I might need to remove gaming from my hobbies but I'd likely to try playing in moderation first, supplemented by other lifestyle changes.
---
That's a really extreme way to put it, but I agree with what you're saying.
---
I met this hunter in loch modan, we partied up and played together for hours, added each other and logged back on same time next day. This continued for about 2 weeks, we were the same level total bros. I told him I could't log on the coming weekend because was visiting family, he said he wouldn't level without me, came home he was like 6 levels above me. Instant child fueled rage mode, deleted him, blocked him, still mad at him.
---
okay thanks, do you think it would run at native 5k resolution? thats where my concern lies.
---
Legion is included in your sub, and DHs came with Legion.
---
I hope this question is appropriate here. I'm going feral druid in a duo. We plan to do a lot of dungeons as tank and healer, but I'm sure there will still be a solid amount of questing. Will tanking be ok if I take the typical cat-focused talent progression, or should I make some more tank relevant picks in lieu of damage in the open world? 
---
Some specific examples: 
---
After first 5 in Ferocity should I still go Feral Aggression, or would the threat or armor from row 2 be severely impactful in dungeons? 
---
Should I still take Feline Swiftness? (my assumption is yes)
---
Blood Frenzy/Improved Shred vs going back to row 2 for more tank talents?
---
Yeah, imagine only being able to roll Undead.
---
So work 18 hours, eat for 3 hours, and sleep for 3 hours?  You need to rethink this life thing.
---
TBC was perfection relative to all other expansions, was Vanilla 2
---
True, but not having it will mark you as a slacker in the guild.
---
Rogue One was ok. Watching it again it is pretty boring, and I can't remember any of the characters names.
---
Scholo is definitely the hardest of these dungeons. Strat Dead is easily the easiest. The pulls are very manageable. Strat living, once you get to the living part is quite annoying and can be difficult without CC.
---
I'd rank it like this. Easier to Harder: undead strat. Lbrs. Strat living.....scholo
---
Flying *could* have been ok under 2 conditions imo.
---
- Never anywhere but outland
---
- Give the players a reason to use the old world
---
If this had been done you would still run into wpvp all the time, just not in outland. That would be fine considering it was designed for flying
---
Lol seriously? There are literally thousands of free games. And no work involved to play them. No having to rebuild them. That's a terrible argument.
---
Lol unfortunately I'm guilty of this with my rl friend :(
---
To this day i still have a grudge against my UBRS group of 15 years ago, giving the Chromatic Carapace to a god damned rogue when i was the warrior tank. I remember the stupid rogues voice "dude im getting my chestpiece" NO UR NOT, ITS WARRIOR SPECIFIC.... still have PTSD
---
The thing is, we know how much damage our autoattacks do already.  We just take the mob health, subtract the damage of a single rend (this assumes we never reapply rend), and that's the single target damage you got. 
---
In case you are wondering, the average health of a level 14 mob is probably about 325. Foreststriders and moonstalkers are around 300, murlocs in darkshore are about 350. 
---
So Improved rend (which is 35% btw, not 45%), 9.8 bonus damage, ignoring armor. 
---
What's cruelty? well, we have a mob with about 300 health remaining. That means each point of cruelty is about 3.3 bonus damage on the same mob. 
---
So 3/3 improved rend, against level 14 mobs, is worth about the same as 3 points of cruelty. But that assumes we never reapply rend, which it is frequently corrrect to do (rend isn't just your best rage dump early on, it's your best rage dump by a MASSIVE MARGIN). If we get half the ticks off on a second rend, all of a sudden 3/3 improved rend, against a level 14 mob, is about as good as 4.5 points in cruelty.
---
Cruelty is better than improved rend. But not infinitely so. up to 12, rend is  better. At 13-14, you now have more total points in cruelty, and for fighting level 14+ mobs, cruelty starts to edge ahead primarily just because you have more total points in cruelty. Up to level 19, cruelty remains better, but of course, 2% parry is not worthless. 
---
But then at 20, this all just gets eclipsed by anger management. and improved rend getting much stronger again AND arms picking up deep wounds, while fury is picking up trash.
---
There is a brief, shining window, where I would say fury beats arms. But it's like "level 15-19". And it's not by a lot.  and arms definitely edges out fury from levels 10-13. 
---
but of course, rend scales very well in group content, as you can just rend every mob you can see. As soon as you are doubling the number of rends you have up at once, you are making rend just better than cruelty.
---
like really tight  
---
hoping I can get something between $400 - $600 max
---
Bless me plz
---
Cut sleep by 50%

This is exactly my problem. I don't overly enjoy Female characters, but Male Orcs have always looked stupid (to me) and just overall look goofy in their gear. I don't see a Male Orc and go, "Ooh, stealthy!"
---
Undead though? God. They scream Rogue in every aspect. I played one back in the day and I was so set on reliving it again until I found about about Orc's Stun Resist. WotF is a great racial, but only really useful against 4 classes, 2 of those which only have one Fear. Combined with the Alliance tending to have less Warlocks, it cuts down on a lot of the mileage it might create. Orcs on the other hand? Most classes have a stun, serious players will all be Engineers, and many people straight up avoid Orcs due to their racial.
---
So I've been looking at the Female Orc and surprisingly, they look absolutely sick in their gear. It's just weird thinking I'll be playing a female character. I keep going back and forth on Functionality (Orc) vs. Aesthetics (UD).
---
So much lost rage to that extra dodge chance 😓😓😓
---
Fort plz
---
If I'm being 100% honest, I have a handful of underage kids that watch my stream and so do their parents LOL. 
---
But just now, I'm realizing how much I cuss on stream....
---
GOOD POINT.
---
Neither PvE spec will work very well in PvP. 
---
For Shaman you are going deep resto in order to get mana tide totem. Most of the later talents in the shaman resto tree wont help you survive or kill anyone, making you a sitting duck. You will have to respec.
---
For druid, you are going to go into restoration and balance for mana effeciency. You will have to skip vital skills in the feral tree for survival. Druids are good in BGs for keeping themselves alive. If you remove that niche you have a healer with slow heals that cant live. You will have to respec.
---
If I had to choose a PvP spec to roll into a BG, I would choose priest to be honest. You can go into BGs as Disc and do pretty decent. But if it has to be druid or Shaman.. Druid for sure.
---
Critics also say that Warlords of Draenor was a better expansion than Mists of Pandaria when it objectively wasn't.
---
&gt; your smart. 
---
okay.  The spell is war stomp.  There is no spell you can cast called warstomp.  
---
The point about being quote, "bad at casting abilities" is a huge benefit for hardiness.  It is a passive ability and does not need to be cast or timed properly.
---
A server is like a cake.  Layers are like layers of the same cake.  When they don't need a layer anymore, they'll have a fat kid eat it.  There are many cakes.
---
Throw them in the whelp room for that.
---
I agree on the quality part of R1, I doubt very much their own story. They need to sell toys. Merchandise is the key for them.
---
They also made Rebels with Darth Maul, Yoda, Kenobi &amp; Darth Vader returning for a spin (or two) that feature my favorite vilain of the old universe, Thrawn.
---
They know how to make quality stuff, yet they also did Solo, but let's not even go there.
---
Again it's my subjective opinion.
---
Nah just give up food for a while
---
&gt; Warlock and mage you can just bind frostbolt/shadowbolt on mousewheel and scroll up and down for most of the raid.
---
For warlocks this also applies throughout TBC (assuming you're at the hit cap).
---
Yes, it will run at that resolution, but you won't be able to maximize every setting out and still maintain 60+ FPS. You'll have to find a compromise. Just don't try any of the rendering scale settings to make higher graphic settings scale to 5k - it will look fuzzy and awful.
---
Yes, servers will be like in vanilla.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, the Hitler card has been played.
---
It is but it also is not that useful and alot harder most don't have addons for the first dungeons and judging how much healing any given rank does in % of hp takes experience. I find it far better to use max rank and wait for 50% hp. Dps really should not take damage and they should eat/bandage between pulls to lessen the healing burden in early dungeons when healer mana is at a premium. In middgame you just have to remember to bring 4 stacks of water to every dungeon and drink after every pull no matter your mana percentages. But that might just be me
---
god what a hilarious mistake, didnt even realize :D:DD
---
yeah, i gotta make my warrior named "Socialjustice"
---
&gt; We're covering 2 different topics
---
Careful with this one, I told him exactly that and he started busting out the sexism. 
---
Not something I thought I'd see in a WoW sub.
---
So if he subs 2 weeks early he's paying for 2 weeks of game time he wouldn't use. 2 weeks of game time comes out to $7.50. He's not talking about paying a literal $7.50.
---
Oh sure I get what you're saying :)
---
Why do you think Rogue benefits the most from WotF versus other classes? The Rogue PvP trinket breaks fear as it is.
---
If I was to be ele when I respec is it good for farming? Like I know it's going to be warlock or hunter speed but is it about average?
---
Okay that is awesome news! Thanks!
---
SWING TIMER should be standard. Even if your a caster, it disappears when you’re not swinging
---
Tyvm dude! Real glad people are finding the pacing to be fair. Wasn't sure how long i should keep items on display etc. Ultimately i wanted this to be a quick run-down.
---
Now you get to use wowhead for no discernable difference!
---
If you are looking for guilds, this is the best place:
---

---
Moar dots
---
If we are talking exclusively tanking Pre-raid BiS that is a definite no on pre raid BiS gear in any slot outside of a trinket you get from a quest.
---
And yes I know there is some BiS gear in there for other roles but this thread was asking about tanking so that's what I'm focusing on.
---
I think when people complain about shallow social politics tokenism they're talking about the stupid fucking lesbian mommy admiral in TLJ.
---
Is it in your mouse-hand or keyboard-hand?  And does "fast paced movement" mean clicking?  
---
If it's mouse, you could do a healer with a bunch of @mouseover macros and heal by just moving your mouse over Party/Raid Bars and using key binds on your keyboard-hand.
---
You'd target the MT (assuming you are healing raids or dungeons) once to start the with and never need to click off them again except if you needed to CC a target (Shackle with Priest for example)
---
Seems like at that point just save money by mining mats yourself than make money by skinning and buying engi mats.
---
I healed on the alliance side with the HotW/NS build up to early Naxx.
---
The spec is perfectly fine for raid healing, because HoTW is +20% intellect, which is a lot of mana, which is really useful in longer fights.
---
Additionally, I tanked 5/10/20 mans with that spec too. Again, it's fine for tanking non-40 mans, assuming you went with a bear spec, as there's no real dps check boss in 20 mans.
---
Tanking problems don't pop up until 40 mans, as that's when you need to generate a ton of threat, due to the dps gear check bosses, which is when you need to go 11/35/5.
---
Ahh yeah, thats the stuff
---
Mostly because of how brutally DoT spells wreck rogues if the initial stunlock doesn't work.
---
Tldr: I stalked a stalker. Got him banned and possibly ruined the game for him.
---
Some teenage punk tried to flirt with my mother, became her bestie for a while. I was smelling something foul from the whole thing. No 16 year old is that interested in a 60 year old woman.
---
You see I was guild master of a fast growing relaxed guild. We would run just about anyone under the sun for gear. This got us friends and perks with the higher end progression guilds because they'd use us to gear up alts and friends. 
---
This guy wanted in on the action but had a damn shitty attitude. Showed up late for raids, hadn't come prepared and ready for the run. We offered access to the guild stores for raids. So all he had to do was visit a merchant for what we couldn't craft and he'd be set. We even allowed access to the money for repairs. He didn't even manage that.
---
One day he turned up 90 minutes, armor broken, no food or anything. No excuses as he just couldn't care. So I publicly reemed his ass out. Told him that I had enough.
---
He asks who did I fuck to become guild leader? Who's penis did I go to town on for my gear. Etc etc and etc. I kick him off of the voice chat, kicked him out of the guild and told him to go rotate.
---
He tend harasses me for weeks and weeks on the game. I report everything to a gm and move on. Several weeks later he turns up on a new account (guess he ended up being banned for x weeks from the bs he dolled out my way). Starts stalking my mother. Turning up literally wherever she was.
---
So I started noticing he was targeting an ex guildie I was friends with. I let her know what went down. She in return told me whenever he was near her. So I stalked him. I can't remember what item I threw at him but I would constantly toss something at him and or emote at him all while hiding. It drove him crazy. Guildies would often go to his zone, pop a guild advert via a macro and leave. So he was constantly seeing our guild around chat.
---
Eventually the asshat stopped trying to muscle in on the higher up guilds and just seemingly disappeared. Amusingly it helped advertise the guild quite a bit. We grew insanely well during the passive aggressive revenge  plot.
---
Thats the plan. Hopefuly asap.
---
IMO thats in my top 3 terrible retail wow changes. I beleive that single handely alone killed world pvp and any sense of community. Which was important in the early days
---
It was very popular in mid-vanilla, but then blizz updated TOS to forbid it. For understandable reasons.
---
Awesome!
---
LOOOL.
---
We are now officially cuss brothers. 
---
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY :P
---
I promise to be as fair as possible, with regards to my Loot Counciling. No worries!
---
Like I answered to the other guy who told me that it never stopped on his server (even during all BC... which make me really think it's bullshit) all I can say is that I didn't play on your server and cannot say you misremember,
---
However... with the implementation of DK and Battleground it's a fact that anybody caring about their rank wasn't in SS-TM anymore so I really doubt your claim as I can't imagine who was playing daily there for 2 years.
---
Here's a random source going my way: https://www.engadget.com/2014/03/14/wow-archivist-the-battle-for-hillsbrad/
---
&gt; In the same patch, Blizzard added the first battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch and the original Alterac Valley. Almost overnight, players migrated from Hillsbrad into the instanced, civilian-free battlegrounds. World PvP would never be the same again.
---
I mained a troll mage in Vanilla and a Blood elf mage TBC&gt;BFA. Since I can’t play a belf yet I decided to take the opportunity to play something completely different! Tauren Druid here I come!!
---
Probably unless you're in my raid where I'm feral tanking then you're looting my scraps
---
&gt; Discord only to guildmates and friends.
---
No. You'll have a Discord server available for your entire realm. Have you not played any modern MMO besides Retail where the LFG tool makes Discord irrelevant?
---
How are you still getting rage while Heroic Striking so much if it prevents you from getting rage on the main hand swing? Is it all from the offhand swings?
---
Just finished them today. Gotta start with War of the Ancients now.
---
What does cartographer and Napster do?
---
I love druid! No one plays it! I get all the loot!! All I have to do is press innervate! I'm a bear! Now I'm a cat!
---
You effectively are gaining 0 rage while eating. Your rage bar gonne be zero when you get up after eating anyway.
---
Thats fine, I am done arguing with someone who thinks piercing howl is trash and think hamstring kiting is still relevant in this convo. Did you miss the beta or what?
---
A lot of YouTubers have been recommending against playing hybrid classes is classic, including Druid’s. Mostly for end game raiding content - I really hope there’s more merit to those classes!
---
I get that. They scale more easily and the cc is very reliable. I just brought it up as a note that healer can dps or heal. Priest is unique with shackles and MC that they can provide a reasonable amount of both as the pulls change. Looking at something like stratholme is where this is really illustrated.   
---
Most of the 5m content can be cleared with offspecs if you have the right gear. On raiding nothing will make a dps caster happier than a PI/weaving spec priest blowing their PI during burst phases.
---
15 but close enough
---
News Flash: People do things in a game they think are fun regardless of the reward or consequences.
---
Cool, thanks for the insight. And my major concern with cat speed is that my partner is a shaman, so if I don't take it he's going to be waiting for me a lot between 20 and 30 lol. Probably should just take it.
---
Liked and subbed.  Looking forward to more Druid shenanigans.
---
Saw you looking based on a budget, here's a very basic build beast machine just under $600 with everything you need. Pick up Windows 10 off of ebay after you order it all from a refurbished / OEM seller. It's legit and works fine.

Leveling a dwarf hunter back in the day, I get to Loch and go to do the trogg quests and there's another dwarf hunter there. Tried to party him and he refused and ran around tagging everything before I did (he was a few levels up). 
---
FF to 60, he's in the rival guild to ours, pretty much the only top 2 alliance guilds and it felt like we were the only 2 dwarf hunters on the entire server, and so we always competed to see who was more geared and spit on each other in IF.
---
I would say Hunter for speed clearing the lower level dungeons, and probably warlock for taking out higher level ones.
---
Link me where I said something sexist.
---
In AQ20 there was some offhand dagger I desperately wanted for my rogue that dropped off like the first or second boss. Every week I’d run it, it wouldn’t drop, and I would leave raid for someone stronger than me. One week I gave my spot to another rogue just for the one run so he could get the experience of running it. The dagger I wanted drops, he gets it, and I was so devastated. I wrote up an angry rant to one of my other friends and accidentally sent it to the rogue that got the dagger!
---
Needless to say I was salty for a long time and disappeared from that guild afterwards.
---
You can run a pvp/pve hyrbid spec, but its not optimal for Raiding. We are talking about raiding only btw. Both druid and shaman have great specs that work for dungeons and PvP at the same time.
---
If you are interested in tanking, you might be able to convice your guild to allow you to run HotW spec. This is a very good pvp spec where you can also tank and heal. It wont perform well on the healing meters but it can swap easily between tanking and healing.  Some guilds allow a druid to run this build when they need an offtank and less healing.
---
Druid is the right choice if you want to give it a shot. Shaman - no way. You need dps talents to live.
---
If it's a 30% chance each time then it remains 30% every time they use a stun on you. The odds don't change based on whether or not the first stun lands.
---
Think of a coin flip. Every time you throw it in the air the chance is 50% and never changes however many times you throw it in the air.
---
&gt; Why the improved arcane missiles though?
---
I needed 5 points to pick up Clearcast, and Arcane Missiles I would (rarely) use while farming while getting beat on when I didn't want spell interruptions.
---
&gt; Also why not go for the combustion.
---
One less thing on the hotbar that I have to worry about or use in a macro lol. As Scorch and Fire Blast were my most used spells (Fireball was mainly my opener, and used again when I had a Clearcast), I could complete a Combustion cycle in less than 5 seconds (2 x 1.5 seconds for Scorch + FB was instant). It wasn't worth the ~2 minute cooldown and I also had trinkets that gave me a lot of spellpower anyway.
---
 I wish I had some of my old screenshots, I remember early in BC getting an Ignite crit for around 600 per tick, for 4 ticks, not including the original spell damage.
---
The downside to this build is there is VERY little survival. It's truly a glass cannon. But god forbid the stars align and you're able to dump a full rotation of crit'ing Fireball, Fire Blast, and Scorch, with Impact and Ignite proc'ing on the target!
---
Yoj haven't made much from scratch have you? Even something seemingly simple like spaghetti and meatballs is an hours-long process if you make the noodles and meatballs from scratch.
---
Ditto with something like gumbo where you have to shred a whole chicken, prep andoillie in the broiler, and prep tons of veggies.
---
Or split pea soup, lima beans and ham+cornbread (soak beans overnight and make the cornbread), gnocchi and pesto, basically any halfway decent meal takes an hour and a half to 3 hours. It's not all "active" time, but a lot of it is. 
---
Tacos are about the quickest thing I can make, and that still involves mixing up masa for tortillas, a meat entry, and beans.
---
holy fuck
---
Yeah food is the one that should be swapped, not sleep. Just need to order a few cases of Soylent to take care of that.
---
A pve focused rogue probably has the lowest global usage per minute aka apm. Especially dagger. This holds true even today in retail due to the nature of energy
---
I won perdition's blade on a rogue guildmate's birthday. I just didn't care. I had more dkp at the time so too bad. I bet he hopes I died or something since he always had horrible luck with weapons and I believe right up until TBC he never got anything better than that dagger from vael.
---
Remove layering ASAP! Whether it's restricted to a week or two, or restricting it to just the first starter zones, or disabled upon hitting lvl 20ish, idc. Just get rid of it. And sooner rather than later.
---
$500 range is perfect for classic and now is a good time to buy AMD processors because the new line just came out, so the old (but still good) stuff has dropped in price.
---
Realms will be independent while layering is in place. Layering is not intended to be cross-realm.

I am not sure if I have the syndrome. But I wake up every other night with intense hand pain in one hand. Other hand is perfectly fine. 
---
I have been doing this for years. 
---
I found that a mouse with side thumb buttons was best. I macro all my attacks into 6 side buttons. Some buttons makes several attacks go off and some don’t. It helps. Razor hex is my choice.
---
I was gonna do Paladin as well, but I kinda burnt myself out on them by capping one and leveling two others to the high 30's on pservers. I love them but I've never done mage before, so that's what Im gonna do to keep it fresh, but definitely having a pally alt.

Play Hemo if you raid as Combat Swords. Play daggers if you raid with daggers. Just use the best weapons that you have available to you and the rest will work itself out.
---
All else being equal (i.e. you're rank 14 and can choose between a dagger and sword of equal power): Hemo has more utility and is probably more useful in groups.
---
Ok thanks, i'll buy another account then!
---
Ok thanks !
---
Have you tried an mmo mouse?
---
What a loser that guy is. Everyone knows rested bonus doesn’t effect quests.
---
If you remain calm, the number is smaller.
---
For sure and you would definitely get banned if you spammed that in a city but in an instance with a guild that's been together for a decade? Less of an issue. They've been doing that shit for like 3 expansions now.
---
Lmao that's overkill. A literal potato with wires stuck in it can run WoW.
---
No and I didn't mean tier either.  This discussion is about layers and cakes and fat kids, not slices.
---
That's weird. Why just Silithus? There were other quests like Searing Gorge and Hinterlands quest hubs that were not added until 1.4 / 1.5, but those quests are ingame at launch.
---
Definitely will be posting more in the near future! Thank you for the support. It means a lot!
---
You want Star Wars Galaxies... Was a good game in it's own right but it also led to entire cities becoming ghost cities with empty merchants all over. I would hate to travel halfway across the game and find an empty merchant.
---
I mean, I'm hoping there are more than simply bejeweled, but I know it was crucial when flying to silithus.
---
Proper gear, enchants and consumables to run a dungeon a few levels early?  Buddy just get to 60 faster and don't waste time with that crap.
---
Is there a place/site/discord where most guilds are forming now?
---
This is solid advice tbh. Druids make excellent tanks for soaking damage and off tanking. Any guild should have at least 1 or 2 and the warrior tanks will love you for helping them get gear faster
---
&gt; pre-subscribe to save a name
---
Just like that. The game will be downloadable by subscribers two weeks early with a full server list. You'll then be able to pick and chose and create characters like normal, just the "Enter World" button will be gray until they press the big red "release Classic WoW" button on the 27th.
---
I don't want to discourage you, because that era of MMOs are my personal favorite (I started with UO and Asheron's Call), but WoW 1.0 may as well be considered second generation, while those other game were first generation, and there are some pretty stark differences between first and second generation MMOs. WoW ushers in what we came to call the "theme park" MMO, where the player is there to experience a storied game world crafted by the developers. First generation MMOs were more or less sandboxes, that left players to explore the game world, and really make their own stories with little or no guidance from the developers.
---
In the first generation MMOs, while there is a greater emphasis on group play and socialization, that also generally means there isn't much of an "endgame" to speak of. WoW was really the first MMO to introduce the idea of, "The game starts at max level." That also means you'll need a pretty consistent group to level, but levels then become milestones unto themselves. There are people that played EQ for years and never hit max level, while others rushed and found themselves with nothing to do. 
---
Questing is another one of the big systems that WoW changed pretty dramatically. First generation MMOs didn't typically have quest markers, there weren't such things as "quest hubs" in zones, and questing wasn't really the primary way that characters leveled in a first generation MMO. WoW's quest system is part and parcel to the "theme park" design principles; quests are the primary way that players experience the story, culminating in the max level endgame to wrap up the story. In first generation MMOs quests were often suggestive, meaning you had to interact with NPCs that might give you a hint about a certain cave or wizard tower or something like that. In EQ the way to discover quests was by querying NPCs through direct text input, you had to hail and NPC and then get the correct sequence of words for the NPC to even tell you anything.
---
Those two major changes to the game's systems really inform the other technical differences between the games. Since there is less emphasis on questing and leveling, "camping" (basically group grinding) becomes the primary way to level, obtain gear, and experience the game. Since group play also becomes a primary way for players to experience the game, the dynamic interaction between groups becomes more important than the dynamic between individual players, and that is why instancing doesn't really work in a first generation MMO. That is why you see Brad and the other VR developers talking so much about the importance of groups being able to see each other and interact in non-instanced dungeons.
---
Again, I don't mean to discourage you, but if you feel like checking out Pantheon and go in expecting anything similar to WoW, I think you'll be shocked to find a very different game. However, as a Pantheon Alpha backer, I do recommend and hope you will check it out.
---
cloud servers, which are generally smaller and perfect for scaling your product to the size it needs to be.
---
the way you're suggesting is what would cause them to be overcharged, because they'd end up with all that empty space on larger servers for tiny realms that they'll still have to pay for.
---
the fov on that lad!
---
Am I the only one that wants classic to stay niche? Let me play Vanilla WoW with people who also love the game. Keep streamers and carebears far away please.
---
I have raided with enough rogues on Vent to know that the carpal tunnel isn't because you have too many buttons to press, but that every button must be pressed 50 times to work.

---
Not sure about 5K on that GPU, though, but that's mostly because I'm unfamiliar with Radeon Pros for gaming use.
---
D:
---
Yeah those million sales would be impressive if it wasn't an MMO. Especially considering the importance they place upon sub times and how they're always offering 6 month mounts. You could sell millions of the expansion but if nobody buys extra sub time (or at least have the few that stay with it buying cash shop items) the MMO is pretty much dead.
---
Them 50g resets oof
---
I would genuinely love this to be a thing I could do with no consequence. Sleep takes up wayyy too much time
---
Honestly, if only 100,000 people were playing and paying 15$ per month every month, they'd make huge profits, more than enough to justify staff/development, and keeping servers up and running.
---
I expect way, way more than just 100,000 players.
---
I lost Dragon's Call to a hunter while leveling my rogue. It's the sheer ignorance of them that boils my blood.
---
This is a good one... Stoneclaw immediately unstealth near by rogues and they ALWAYS get surprised which then they panic.
---
30/21, heart of the wild/nature swiftness, lots of youtube videos that talk about it, specifically skarmtank.  the build allows you to pvp well, and tank 5mans and some raid encounters if geared properly, all while being able to heal everything else due to increased mana and reduced healing touch cost, pluse nature swifntess.  it's the spec i'll probably be rolling with.
---
Yup, even doing something like chicken and brocolli and rice takes at least 30 minutes to cook. If you have to buy the stuff, clean and cut the chicken, cut the brocolli, you're looking at at least 90 minutes.
---
Edit: I replied to the wrong comment but w/e. 2 hours everyday is kind of high but very possible if you buy fresh everyday. 2 hours or so 3 times a week though is not unreasonable at all though.
---
Wasn't there runscript castspellbyname, target = mouse over, exists, or something like that?
---
I'm pretty sure that was a thing.
---
Dont try your reservation on their actual names, try on people who are going to be on their guilds, you can always delete the character and create another.
---
Oh yes, in PvP you're quite right. Was thinking in the context of pve, sorry.
---
&gt;The opening post has been updated with the following:  
---
&gt;Cone of Cold is behaving consistently with the reference client.  
---
&gt;Arcane Missiles does not put the caster in combat .  
---
&gt;A Hunter’s Frost Trap ground effect will break Rogues out of stealth.  
---
&gt;The Berserking Troll racial ability is behaving as expected and matches the reference client.  
---
&gt;The pet that a Warlock has when initially logging into the game world does not restore a Soul Shard when dismissed by taking a flight path or moving out of range.  
---
&gt;The trigger range on Hunter’s traps are reduced by Stealth when the stealthed player is a similar or higher level than the Hunter.  
---
&gt;Soul Link cannot be dispelled by dispelling the Warlock’s pet.  
---
&gt;A Warlock’s Succubus pet cannot cast spells if they are out of line of sight of the target.  
---
&gt;Manually cancelling Stealth after using Vanish will remove the Vanish buff as well as the Stealth buff.  
---
&gt;Escape Artist has a very small chance to fail when used to escape an effect that has a decreased chance to be dispelled (e.g. a Rogue’s Vile Poisons talent).  
---
&gt;Rogues are not broken out of stealth by Blizzard until they take damage.  
---
&gt;Taunting Hunter pets that are set to Aggressive or Defensive mode will cause them to attack the taunting player.  
---
&gt;Hunter concerns:  
---
&gt;Hunter “dead zone” is working as expected and is consistent with the Reference Client  
---
&gt;A wolf pet’s Howl buff is consumed by anything that causes damage, even if it does not benefit from the buff  
---
&gt;A Hunter pet’s Bite and Claw ability damage will not change in the tooltip based on the happiness of the pet. The tooltip will always display the damage as if the pet were Content (yellow). This is consistent with the Reference client  
---
&gt;Traps can sometimes not be triggered if a player moves over them very quickly (i.e. a Warrior’s Charge ability). This behavior is consistent with the Reference client.  
---
&gt;Auto Shot does not make a sound when cast during the animation of Hunter’s Mark and certain other abilities  
---
&gt;Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns  
---
&gt;A Hunter’s Frost Trap ground effect will break players out of stealth  
---
&gt;Additionally, the wording of the following was modified to be a bit clearer:  
---
&gt;"Melee leeway" is working as intended in both PvE and PvP.
---
You get what you wanted, purists. Enjoy Blizzard not fixing bugs or shit they broke in 1.12 because "that's just the way it was back then!" :-)
---
In order of ascending difficulty:
---
BRD -&gt; LBRS -&gt; Strat Live -&gt; Scholo -&gt; Strat UD -&gt; UBRS
---
You can do most of BRD @ 54 but don't try to do the Lyceum until you're at least level 58. For all of the others, you really want to be 60. Even LBRS. You will make so many ass pulls if you try and tank that place before 60.
---
Yes. I want the only Banky, spelled properly, on my server. That's just for my bank ofc.
---
Hey thanks, I read a bit farther down and the answer was there and I didn’t edit my post.

---
hey im looking in to getting myself a laptop simply for wow classic just like OP
---
i like this $300 but i also might play fornite and am curious if i should spend a couple hundred more or if you think this one is good enough for both games?
---
 (im very unknowledgeable on laptops, i apologize)
---
I don't like Disney. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
---
Imagine clicking the WoW icon in the Launcher and 4 little mini icons drop down from it with Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, and Retail on em.
---
People used to do 40 man raids on Voodoo 3dfx cards...
---
Inspecting gives you a much more personal and in depth evaluation, gear score is just a number that can be inflated with bad items and enchants which might not even be that good for you
---
on private servers, I have found myself constantly using higher gear score items that decrease my performance just because 95% of the server population only care abour the number and I want to give myself the best chance to be accepted into pugs and guilds
---
in vanilla, there are many cases where a blue item is very good, sometimes even BIS for a class and epic item is a complete joke
---
Yeah you're definitely right. If you think you can get a kill in the five seconds of immunity though, I'd still say go for it.
---
Mmmmmm yeah but it was a joke so chill
---
Rey’s force feats by the end of her first movie: 
---
1. Can guard her mind from force probing
---
2. Can perform a Jedi mind trick
---
3. Can force pull a lightsaber(that is also being pulled by a trained force user and win no less) 
---
4. Defeat or force a stalemate on an enemy in lightsaber combat 
---
Luke’s force feats by the end of his first movie:
---
1. Listens to a ghosts advice to let the force help him aim
---
Clearly they were both OP characters from the get go, right guys?
---
Pvpers all talk a big game, but most of them just want to win, any way they can. And an easy fight is....easier than a daunting one.
---
Also, easy matches go far quicker than tough ones. Meaning lots more rep per hour. So they're incentivized to want easy matches. Can't blame them for that, though.
---
The joke used to be that any game made by blizzard would suck out your soul for a few years, now they just suck.
---
What race are you going to play?
---
I wouldn't bother with Spirit Tap at all at level 60.

Drive home? What? I meant you pick up something from the fridge... you must be a American, I heard you like buying food outside. We don't do that here in Europe. We buy stuff in the Supermarket and put it in our fridges.
---
Doubt it, had to be at least 3 characters long if I recall correctly.
---
I think they are making it their duty to trash every single western geeky thing that exists.
---
Not to mention the variety of bosses/mobs immune to nature damage, which makes an elemental shaman completely and utterly useless.
---
Orc helps with rogues/warriors/druids... That mirror match-up bonus is damn tempting. Druids I generally only target if I'm in an obviously advantageous situation, otherwise I generally ignore them. Warrior the benefits are pretty minor anyways. Orc also has blood fury which is nice for dps. Engineering is a pretty great point. So, factoring in PVE, I totally get choosing Orc.  
---
BUT, if you're going rogue and mainly care about PVP I think I'd still prefer Undead. Priests and Warlocks are such natural targets for rogues (cloth wearers with minimal mobility, hard for other classes to target as they tend to stay back). I want to make sure those matchups are consistently as advantageous as possible. Plus cannibalize is pretty solid for solo content, which can't be underestimated given rogue's difficulties with solo pve.  
---
I think its mainly about who rogues want to target in world pvp/BGs. I'm not really building a rogue for 1v1 duels. I want to eliminate cloth wearers from the world and BGs as quickly and easily as possible.  
---
Engineering does mess with the equation a bit, but I prefer the lore for undead rogues over orcs, so that's my final factor.
---
True enough. There was just a bunch of people spamming stuff like this in mid-vanilla before they outlawed it
---
I was a music major who played wow. Carpal tunnel was my life.
---
I'm thinking of Attack mb
---
There has always been a negative stigma surrounding hybrids in classic, especially druids unfortunately. IMO a lot has changed since then. People discovering new ways to make druids more viable, we are more educated on WoW with how long the game has been out etc. 
---
I've also seen a lot of videos about the BEST class in vanilla. The truth is, its very situational for which classes are  better among others.
---
The release date vertical asymptote
---
Lame.
---
Subbed for the first stress test, just had to, let my sub lapse after that. Will be subscribing the day of character creation.
---
rogue has highest apm, so don't pick a rogue
---
From time to time? of course
---
Daily for two years with a system that actively punished people interested in PvP rewards to participate for absolutely no gain in a MMO?
---
Like I said either you were playing on very special server where for some reasons, world pvp doesn't mostly disappeared at 1.5 unlike almost every servers or you're just misremembering.
---
Games that effectively use multicores are rare though. In a perfect world the 3900X would destroy the 9900K in gaming. But it's not a perfect world.
---
What a wondeful story. Also, fuck that hunter. He got what he deserved. I only hope he remembered that he ninja'd the staff from you way back when, and that's why you did what you did.
---
That's pretty nuts. At that point, I would have just rented a tiller, tilled the yard, and used seed. But that's messy, and risky if you get a hard rain. (And also depends on yard size)
---
And honestly, as much as I love playing wow... I would take the love from my wife any day. She doesn't say "DONT PLAY WOW AND PAY ATTENTION TO ME." She understands I love the game, so she leaves me alone when I want to play.
---
But I'm not the same person I was when I was younger. I don't necessarily want to play WoW for 18 hours a day anymore. Sure, maybe a weekend here and there I will, but I can't even sit down at work for 8 hours a day.
---
Not at 5k resolution...
---
Becoming a wpvp god is the only reason I need :D
---
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
this is covered in (main hand weapon speed)
---
spamming would be pressing a key at least 5 times a second
---
Ever try Fight Milk?
---
When I was leveling my alt shaman I jokingly dueled ppl who were also waiting for zeppelin out of boredom, but this one priest mc'd me and threw my down strategically just so that I would miss the zeppelin. Idk his name but that was generally pretty shitty thing to do imo.
---
Removed as offtopic.
---
How else am I going to get Legolas69
---
There was no punishment for those battles unless you went into the town and killed civilians. After DHKs, the battles just stayed in the middle.
---
Plus, you can just have a mage make you food in game.
---
While personally I think its a bit silly not to go dwarf for PvE on alliance but....
---
Its really not that important, if NE is what you heart desires dont deny it
---
Any idea what happened to him? Did he realize his idiocy and at least apologize?
---
There is a chance that content that is not in beta will be in classic. I would not bet on that, but there is no guarantee here.
---
Even if the beta accurately shows what they intend to do, they could still change their mind for one of many reasons.
---
The only redeeming thing Rogue One had going for it is the fact that all the characters died in the end.
---
Don't try it?
---
Play a Pally without engineering and you'll never strain yourself.
---
I plan to play ele/resto shaman at 60(I do NOT plan to dps raids as shaman before anyone asks). Will probably level as enhance until like 30-40+. My real question is, I love pvp and will be duo leveling with a warrior. I have read a lot about orc vs tauren for shaman, and Im really leaning towards tauren because it seems that warstomp and grenades give you a lot of options for healing and getting burst combos off. Orc stun resist seems nice but I plan to keep FAPs and LAPs on hand and blood fury doesn't seem all that great as I don't really plan on playing enhance at later levels.
---
Is there any other reason not to go Tauren instead of Orc for higher level Ele/Resto play? Aside from the fact that I generally like orcs more than Tauren (still love taurens though)
---
My fiance is rolling orc warrior, so the only downside is she'll have to wait until I get my starting totem quest out of the way before I can sprint through the barrens and play together.
---
Just kind of undecided on race but leaning towards Tauren, any help from experienced shamans is appreciated.
---
Man, that's crazy true. I'm always whining to my wife how I never have time to play video games.. and then that rare weekend rolls around where I got nothing to do. I go upstairs, play games until 2-3 in the afternoon and then start whining about how I want to do something else. 
---
She's quick to remind me that I'm always complaining I don't have time, and then when I have it I'm complaining about being unproductive or bored haha! Funny how that works.
---
oh yeah, never thought of that.
---
It's also a spell that only lasts 15 seconds, with a 3 minute cooldown, and can also be dispelled or purged. Any caster with a brain is not going to cast spells on you when they see your feedback active. Whereas shadowguard has 3 charges, deals damage to *everyone*, also has a chance to proc blackout, and has no cooldown. Alliance premades are only inviting dwarves for fear ward anyway, so good luck with your very situational 3 minute cooldown in randoms.
---
Damn dealing with players is hard enough. Much less an omnipotent employee...
---
It's amazing how memories like these can still be so intact lol.
---
Im running classic in iMac mid 2011. You will be fine.😊
---
Yea, get everyone you know playing classic together and PUMP UP those p5 NUMBERS
---
This is a small nitpick because I think it really adds to the flavor of the class, but as a rogue you need to carry around blinding powder, vanishing powder, and poisons and the mats to make those poisons. There’s nothing like getting into a sticky situation and hitting your vanish key and nothing happens.
---
Like we all did with Ripley, Sarah Connor, and Blade right?
---
I mean, it's been 20 years and people are STILL hating on those characters for being women or black!
---
What the actual fuck lmao.
---
Hey man, that's pretty cool. Just watched a couple other of your videos, not bad at all. Keep it up!
---
Yeah I did that a bit when I first moved into my own place but quickly shifted to doing Sunday meal preps and/or having quicker, less effort meals (pasta+meat sauce, steak and frozen veggies, etc) ready to go if I get bored eating the same thing all week.
---
So support that argument with some math. Argue that improved battle shout is comparable in value to improved rend. Do your own work here. 
---
Because if you did, I would submit that at level 22 (new rank of battle shout), you would find that improved rend is well over 2 times as much damage per point, as improved battle shout. Because I have done the math.
---
An ad hominem is just not a substitute for an argument. Do the math, and then post the math.
---
Unfortunately I got the feeling they never understood why. Tbh I hope they are still asking why to this day.
---
Dm'd!
---
not all heroes wear capes
---
Am American, and we do have very accessible food options.  Most major cities you can have almost any food delivered.  I do chuckle at your smug/superior undertones in the text though.
---
Losing a Tier piece in MC because my internet went down right as we downed Garr. Guild couldn't wait 5 min for me to get it back up so I could loot. GM was a douche fo sho.
---
So.... you're seriously saying I should cast less mana efficient spells and overheal just to burn my mana pool? Because shit never goes sideways?
---
I always aim for max efficiency so that if something goes wrong recovery is possible.
---
Once you get decent weapons for a given phase, daggers is better. Go 16/12/23 for improved sprint and prep, allows you to stand a chance against mages. 
---
If your gear is sub par, cold blood hemo is better because you can use the evis for your damage while you control the fight. You can level as hemo, too, it's actually fantastic if you expect pvp a lot. You lose damage, but you're able to control the fight better than combat and its' brute force requirement. 
---
Daggers is pretty boring in pve though, and is easily out-damaged by combat swords builds.
---
Same, works on a private server pretty well with a few exceptions.  I’m worried.
---
To this day, there was a Rogue named Noiven (his alt was a Priest, I think, name Nevion) - huge jerk, super annoying, really childish. Eventually up and left our guild when server transfers opened, and I was quite happy about it.
---
Also, Varak/Exivate was our old GM. Dude up and left one day I believe in BWL-era, with the guild bank, booting everyone. To my knowledge he just quit the game as this was before server transfers iirc. We all moved to our alt guild &lt;Sadface&gt; and kept raiding that way, making progress into Naxx etc before TBC.
---
I don't know if I *still* hold a grudge, but I don't think I'll ever forget their character's names or classes.
---
MotC is a good mix of mitigation and threat, but SHotM is better for straight mitigation. Also, MotC uptime can be problematic when tanking a single target, particularly if it has a slow attack speed.
---
However if I decide not to level enchanting, that is definitely the trinket that will take it's place.
---
I think it is more about people really stretching for reasons to hate on retail. I don't play retail and haven't since wrath, but people post a lot of horseshit reasons for why vanilla is better. Everyone I knew had the thottbot addon or looked shit up there. 
---
Another good example is how the open ended design of classic dungeons was so loved. Yet in vanilla and on private servers, Scarlet Monastary (100% linear dungeon) is leaps and bounds more popular than every other pre 60 dungeon. The most hated dungeons? Gnomeragan and Maraudon, the most open ended leveling dungeons. even BRD was hard to find groups for in vanilla and p servers despite supposedly being everyone's favorite instance.
---
We didn't have a threatmeter until Omen came out during late AQ40 days
---
I mean my more original names will be fine but I want to contest some of the pop culture names

As an alliance priest I swear Inever hid on the bottom of the zepp and mc people off at the last moment. But to do that to your own faction seems especially low.
---
If you think your name will not be taken, then sure enough it will be.
---
I’m on a 2011 MacBook but I’m worried it struggled bad in places like Dalaran.
---
In a 40 man raid there are 8 groups of 5. You can really never have too many sets of shamam totems.
---
It's going to be a druid, that I'm sure of. Going to tank and heal 5-mans and hopefully heal in raids. Now the hard part.. Horde or Alliance?
---
I'm a simple man. I see the paladin porn pasta, I upvote.
---
I think a lot of it is experience based too - if someone ran scholo a lot they had way more familiarity with it and it may seem easier. 
---
I ran LBRS a TON walking people through attunements and that sort of thing, and despite the familiarity with it, it could still prove to be a bear sometimes ( I was a healer, not a tank). But you grow to love a place like that after a while!
---
All I know is that I watched a video comparing the Beta dungeon xp gain to that famous world record xp gain and the beta was indeed faster by a noticeable margin.
---
Maybe dig through Def Camp or Kargoz' videos they I watch them and they did serious testing.
---
Makes sense. Thanks!
---
I don't know about you, but a lot of my meals are consumed on loading screens, flight points, and trips to the Tower (all game dependent).  Always baffles me when my buddy tells me they've got to log off because the pizza just showed up.  It's pizza...it screams gaming convenience.
---
I'd just blow my mount money on Blackjack...
---
It was one of my biggest raiding roadblocks too. I had decent gear but the dagger would have been my biggest upgrade, it was my ticket to BWL and the rest of AQ.
---
It was a massive disappointment but at least it came as a result of trying to help another person. Now that I’m older and more mature I think I’d do it again.
---
weren't there no guards, also? I remember the quest area in epl being a slaughterhouse just like nessingwary. then I came back after a break of a few months and was instagibbed by guards after attacking someone there.

Go take a nap.

Yeah but Disney will do it without violence and gore and a true dark atmosphere and more like "kid friendly" like star wars with jokes and forced romances
---
don't get me wrong, we absolutely hated each other. Would always call each other out in world chat/lfg/trade, and he was generally a complete asshole to everyone he met. a lot of people saw him and confused the two of us so it wasn't exactly easy being a dwarf hunter with him around.
---
plus he was welsh..

yeah id like to know this aswell

Concerning the troll vs undead debate,  there was a detailed comment on UD vs Troll PvP shadow priests made by a SPriest video maker from RetroWoW, Fleyz. I think he broke it down very well, so I'll just copy paste it here :

&gt;**1) WOTF vs Berserking** \- WOTF is only useful vs A) Classes which fear (Priests / Warriors / Warlocks) B) Those classes need to land a fear - I play an extremely cowardly play-style, very rarely getting feared. C) You can use Berserking vs EVERY CLASS. D) Berserking Mind blast is one of the hardest spells in the game to interrupt E) Berserking Mana Burn is the fastest stationary mana drain in vanilla F) Berserking Mind control is Savage.  
---
&gt;**2) Hex of Weakness** is a 30 yd range curse which reduces healing by 20% for 2 mins. It also reduces the physical damage done by the target by a minor amount. My tactic with Hex is that I'm purely using it for the healing de-buff. Which means I can use Rank 1 Hex. Rank 1 Hex costs 35 mana and has NO COOL DOWN. It can only be dispelled by Mages and Druids. I've racked up some serious playtime with my priest and I can count on one hand the amount of time my curse has been dispelled. I use max rank Hex on melee who are training myself or someone on my team who is decent (for a bit more mitigation) Hex also affects POTS, Healthstones, Death coils and Whipper Root Tubers. On Retro-wow the food which everyone uses form the vendor restores 5% of you HP every second. This food counts as a "heal" so the Hex can further slow their regeneration.  
---
&gt;**3) Shadowguard vs Touch of Weakness** \- Shadowguard is similar to touch of weakness except, it doesn't apply a curse debuff to the attacker reducing their melee damage (BAD) and cannot crit (Which isn't always bad as it will not proc enrage on warriors training you). However Shadowguard hurts melee and ranged attacks and can proc blackout and shadow weaving, has a low mana cost and gets an absurd % of spell damage and has a stack of 3. Meaning you need to re-apply it less (Touch of Weakness has 1 charge).  
---
&gt;**4) Undead is still strong**, don't get me wrong. Undead can even be stronger than Troll in certain situations. You can't use Devouring plague in 100% of fights though and one simple cleanse from a paladin really does hard counter DP. Also Dwarves who have any idea know they can stoneform out of it.
---
Generally Berserking is quite OP, but most people don't like Troll's aesthetics.
---
For sure man, I'm not trying to dissuade you. I'm torn, though thinking I'll end up going Female Orc in the end with an UD Mage as my alt.
---
I will say though that, objectively, I do see Orc coming out on top. There aren't as many Warlocks on the Alliance due to WotF which definitely cuts down the use some. Combined with the PvP Trinket breaking fear but nothing to break stuns (unless you wanna drop $$$ on FAPs) it gets hard to justify 2 Classes.
---
I'm rambling though and UD Rogue is incredibly strong. No wrong choice! :)
---
for Feral Druid

We all need to wipe our asses, so stock up on it.  Silk &amp; runecloth is too pricey for buttwipes and strings of wool cloth get stuck up there while you're cleaning up after a big starchy fudge log.
---
Linen cloth is your friend.
---
Sorry but you don't seem like a "serious" raider at all.  The games been out for 15 years.  What the better professions are isn't a mystery.  Theres a reason why competitive guilds make engineering mandatory.  Not only that but a LARGE reason why engineering is unbeatable for hunters is because it allows you to solo clear Dire Maul Tribute for gold.  Without it (seaforium charges) you can't do that.
---
Too far as a unit of measuring?
---
Or too far to have the hubris that you'll actually survive long enough before dying of boredom?
---
I still hold a grudge against this guy from vanilla.  
---
We were both resto shamans, and during one of our less successful ZG raids as we were wiping on Thekal, I noticed that he was using Deathbringer while healing, so I asked him politely in a whisper if he could maybe please put on his actual healing weapon since we were struggling, to which I got royally reamed out over on ventrilo by pretty much everyone. It was apparently not my place, he had gotten that axe because he deserved it and he could damn well use whatever gear he liked.  
---
I've made many decisions over the years that I regret, but instaquitting that day was not one of them.
---
What? that DK didn't happen in TM-SS?
---
just google it and first result: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2191130564
---
&gt; Good ol' dishonorable kills. If you killed a citizen, that's a DK. TM vs SS there was a lot of anger because people would accidentally kill a citizen, and everyone would leave. 
---
&gt;love the old DKs.. would be doing a TM raid and all of a sudden a DK would pop up on your screen, bye bye raid
---
&gt;DKs killed Tarren Mill vs South Shore fighting as getting too close to either town meant the raid broke up instantly
---
You don't seem to know what you're talking about
---
Mom's spaghetti
---
ummm, not all hunters are huntards.  I think I had more keybindings on my hunter than I did on almost any other class.  you have your pet, kiting, traps, FD, HM, Aimed/Arcane/Multi shots, etc.
---
This is my line of thinking. The target audience of Classic is people who wanted it and thus already know about it. Why would Blizzard try and bring in new people to Classic? Retail has a $60 purchase fee tied to it as well as in-game store. If Blizz wants new people to start playing WoW, they're going to push them towards retail.
---
So if I should never overheal, how do I ensure I go to zero mana at the end of the fight?
---
Healing for what's needed to top a person off generally is how you max mana efficiency.
---
Your comment is self-contradictory. Usually when shit hits the fan it means *more* healing, not less. So downranking then makes no sense if it didn't before.
---
I created a Priest on launch 2004. Kept at it. Achievements came out, kept at it. I got tired of my priest and wanted to tank but I always had that feeling I did so much on my Priest I'll stick with him.
---
This time around, I'm playing a Druid. If I want to tank i can. If I want to dps I can. If I want to heal I can. Dev have said they are open to doing further expansions. This is finally my chance for a fresh start on the class I've always wanted to play. Later expansions Druids owned. Especially in TBC.
---
And I like cats...
---
Haha this comment gives me such positive vibes for the classic community. A lot of us are as you say older and wiser and that could result in a really great experience.
---
Saving this so i can steal it.
---
RemindMe! August 28, 2019
---
Boys, I gotta come clean.  I was that hunter once.
---
Back when I first started playing vanilla, I was like 19 years old; old enough I should have known better, but this was my first time playing an MMO, and was still pretty bad at games in general.  Playing a night elf hunter on Alexstrasza with no less than four L's in my character's name, I had no idea what min/maxing was.  I clicked my abilities.  I was garbage, plain and simple.  I didn't run very many mods, but somehow I got AtlasLoot working.
---
And I knew I wanted that purple sword from Zul'Farrak.
---
I was still leveling, but made it a point to run that place every chance I got.  Probably 10 runs into the grind (which seemed like a lot at the time), and having lost rolls on the swords a couple times, I finally won one of them.  It was the tank version, and I beat out the actual tank in a need roll.  I was ecstatic!
---
He was...not.  
---
Told his guildmate in the party something to the extent of "and this is why I can never get upgrades" before (rightfully) kicking me from the group and running to the next boss.  Having lost party chat, and with the hearthstone countdown looming, all I could do to defend myself was to /yell "But I won the roll fair and square! What's the problem?"
---
Oh well, I thought to myself.  As far as I was concerned, I was halfway to my Sul'thraze!  So I showed off my newly acquired weapon in gchat.  My warrior buddy asked if I had rolled against the tank for it, to which I answered I had.  To this point, my knowledge of stats in WoW is that Hunters need agility, and that higher DPS on your weapons is probably pretty good, too.  My warrior buddy, bless him, took the next hour or so to explain which stats were useful for which classes, and why the damage of my Raptor Strike really isn't that important.  
---
I felt terrible.
---
I tried messaging the player I had taken the sword from to apologize, but both he and his buddy had ignored me after I shouted at them in the end of that instance.  And besides, you couldn't trade loot back then, so I was stuck with it anyway.
---
Over the next few months, I eventually got to 60, and through lots of advice from guildies and utilizing tools like EJ, I became a semi-competent Hunter (though I still clicked my abilities, I didn't break that habit until I tried Arenas in BC).  Our guild killed some bosses in ZG, and even one in AQ20, but even teaming with another smaller guild never had the ability to get anywhere in MC.  After BC was announced, people gave up trying to progress, and started pugging the easier raids.  I figure, hey, I can finally see some of those bosses die, and maybe get a piece of Tier 1 to boot!  All my guildies got into a raid, told me to come as well.  So I whisper the raid leader.
---
Ignored.
---
It was the tank from ZF all those months ago.  My friends petition him to invite me, and everybody from my guild gets booted from the raid.  In terms of video games and other things that don't really matter, I've never felt worse about anything in my life.  That pug ended up clearing MC.  
---
The next day I rolled a Tauren Warrior on another server, a fresh server that had just opened in anticipation of Burning Crusade.  Started a new guild with new friends, went on to play in numerous raiding guilds, in all warrior specs, and even got Gladiator one season (Arms/Resto druid lol).  I tanked a lot of dungeons, and always, always made it a point to help people when they were new to the game.  It took a while, but I think I ended up back on the right side of karma.
---
Lol now we got to the root of the issue
---
Hamstring is a must; even with leeway I think on PvP servers you'll be happy you got it; training past rank 1 is debatable. You will need to at least train rank 1 of almost all spells like cleave, shield bash, thunder clap, pummel, etc. But training past rank 1 is not very necessary for any of the spells you mentioned except for Overpower i think?  Also YES train charge and intercept. You will need them.
---
actually pre 40 shadow is quite lack luster
---
Uh from one classic tank to you. If you dont have KTM or Omen you're gonna need to find another tank to hold ur hand in your live strat and DM chest runs
---
If you arent overhealing while still healing for as much as possible and you're not at risk of going to 0 mana, you don't need to pop runes and major mana potions. I think we both agree on this, we just approached it from two different positions.
---

no thanks
---
Hey we’re all in it together, right? My goal for classic is to have a decently geared healer and tank and fill roles to help my lesser geared guildmates get what they need. My favorite thing about wow is the raiding, I want others to share in the fun!
---
That and...ya know, gonna need plenty of people to do the 40-mans.
---
Again, people adapted. I participated in huge TM vs SS battles without ever joining a raid.
---
My guild leader reported me for saying “that’s so gay” in a whisper and I got banned for 3 days.
---
In those 3 days I missed out on the *only* drop of the other half of the ZG claw that proc’s and turns you into a tiger. I’d spent months trying to get it. 
---
Never forgave that asshole. Dunno what his problem was, was completely out of the blue, didn’t need to get me banned for something so petty.
---
Same for me, plus people want a group of all 60s for end game dungeons even if they are doable below that level. It's harder to form groups in that level range because of that.
---
Better just let them die then :p
---
A WoW classic video that doesn’t have 8 minutes of backstory and channel promotion for 3 minutes of content? Is that legal?

this is absolutely incredible... i CANNOT think of a better way to prep

I'm not saying they *should*

I'm just saying Shadow is much more fun and common for priests in pvp from what I remember.

Didn’t know that! That’s amazing! Thanks

Had a lot of feedback on the last post. In this vid I go over the BiS gear for Pre-raiding as resto druid, and the BiS gear you can get in Phase 1 overall.

As a level 13(ish) I was bored of Westfall and wanted to explore so I started swimming down the STV river. Between the fish, alligators, big cats, and goblins I basically couldn't move more than a yard without being brutally murdered by level skull monsters. I was pissed and rez timers were always going. I was angry to the point where I took it personal and wouldn't stop swimming (something good had to be at the end of this river!). It took me hours to get to booty bay and the fish in particular really bothered me. As a level 60 with one week left until BC I murdered all of the fish in the river multiple times. And again at level 70. And level 80. I guess by 85 I let it go...the cataclysm took care of them for me.
---
Still better than any alternative.
---
Wait, was there another message? Something about friendship, teamwork, and effort?
---
1) Warrior Tank
---
Shadow is fun but some people enjoy being a pvp healer (me), and priest is the best pvp healer on horde by far. 
---
That being said, I will be playing tri-spec so I'll still have talents in shadow down to silence.
---
hahaha
---
&gt; Who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?
---
They may be testing a low advertising approach to launch too see if it'll work. A few games recently have blown up without any real advertising so Classic may be a good test bed to see if they can get away with no advertising certain games. Specifically ones with strong built in player bases that'll do the advertising for them via the internet and especially on platforms like twitch.
---
Shh. Don’t tell everyone how cool we are. Then they will want to join in.

This thread is high key 🔥

You can, however any class that night elves are unable to be, you will not have a trainer for.  Also any class quest will need to be done in your correct starting zone. (Priest Hunter warlock etc.)

Wow what a tale of redemption. I'm sorry to hear your whole guild suffered for a misunderstanding. Unfortunately you don't see what the person behind the screen is thinking and reactions come fast and grudges are held onto for less lol.

But I do remember that sword and I think the combined version wasnt very good for warrior anyway lol.

"Resilience was the single greatest thing to happen to WoW PvP."

No it was not, it brough a lot problems to the game.

 "Started the path of PVP actually being a viable path of "only content to consume". "  
---
Thats not how an MMORPG should work.  
---
" It felt kinda ridiculous that you HAD to raid at the highest level to be competitive in PvP in TBC and that it was a big advantage in Wrath, too. "

It doesnt feel ridicilous, this an MMORPG, not a PVP game, if people want PVP only there is plenty of games for that, thaats not what MMORPG's are about.

---
It wasn't the whole guild, thankfully, just the 5 or 6 of us trying to get into that pug.
---
As for the sword, the 2-hander was okay at best, but the blue one-hander that dropped is one of the lowest level weapons with actual tank stats (1% to parry), so it was really good for a warrior.  And really bad for a hunter :(
---
It does apply in Vanilla, some of the Rank 13 gear was extremly strong untill the very end of the games progression
---
I think they are both strong. I would agree that Tauren might be slightly better because of stomp and that you get no value out of blood fury. Although stun is good too and cdew won the 40 tournament as orc against the highest level pvpers in the game, so it can be done as orc. It’s really up to your aesthetic preference on this one. I’m personally going troll because I like the casting animations better plus you can fire off some fast damage/healing once you’re at half life or less.
---
I just want my characters created so come launch night I can just log right in and get going.
---
No one is taking the names I'm going to use, so I'm not worried about that in the slightest.
---
The level of cringe during some online arguments can be hard to bear. But somethings are just so frustrating!
---
Nah knew a Bh
---
Yes. And if you want to do the Dire Maul:North Tribute solo-farm (which you should it's ridiculous Gold/Hr) you need engineering to bomb open the door.
---
You are wrong, some of the Rank 13 gear is good all the way to Naxx.
---
Have you tried changing gear? Vertical mouse and something like an orbweaver can change. I have also reduced my playtime drastically myself. Had a year where i almost played no games at all to let it rest. Better now.
---
No, this is a living breathing world, not an arcade game. If you want the best gear you have to go through everything the game has to offer.
---
What about Boahn’s Fang from Boahn outside of WC?
---
I leveled to 31 in vanilla on my warrior with my best friends priest and it was AMAZING! We pulled huge packs of mobs, I'd switch to sword and shield and just spam thunder clap while my priest healed. Super easy and fun way to level and it helps the Warrior out a lot because Warrior is one of the toughest to level solo.

---
Prebis list for MC has quite a few differences from what would be bis for dungeons too though. Combat rogue has pretty awful dps on single target over the few seconds it takes to kill dungeon trash compared to either of the other trees for example. They are however, extremely good at beating on sheep when they notice their dps sucking.
---

---
Hunters that identify as mages
---
FAP doesn't remove effects though, right? Just makes you immune. Dunno about spider belt. And imp sprint &gt; vanish for breaking a snare, in terms of priority, imo, because if you use imp sprint to break/close a gap, you have vanish for an instance that allows it to have more impact, especially if you're dotted up, which wastes the opportunity to return to stealth. So I'd say imp sprint's functionality has a different situational application to FAP or vanish, and idk much about spider belt.
---
Thank you this was a good read!

Intuitive thought is to go mining but herby makes more money most of the time so you can use that extra gold you’re making to just buy the ore off the ah. Once you max engineering you’re then in a better position to make gold for other things.

Druids are trash.
---
I'm playing a druid because 15 years ago... I played a druid and I loved it. I loved being able to help my guildmates out in a number of different ways. I also liked the fact that there weren't a lot of druids around and I felt unique to some extent. I learned to like tanking and I really liked healing. It just is my kind of jack of all trades character.
---
No cd on use. 3 charges. 30s cd when you equip a new one. So it's up for 90s, down for 30, per pummeler.
---
They haven't confirmed they are in at launch, but it seems likely. The Silithus zone revamp didn't happen until patch 1.8 and includes story that leads into the opening of AQ so it makes more sense for it to be included with phase 4. It also includes a lot of catch up gear, so that's another reason to not have it available at launch.
---
But its just 3 dungeons out of many, for every SM you have a Maraudon or BRD.
---
In TBC it's EVERY SINGLE ONE.
---
Well, I'm going to be Dugger the paladin!
---
&gt;Instead bgs became 2nd fiddle, while everybody ran arenas
---
There were not even items for half the item slots from arena points. You had to go to battlegrounds and / or PVE raids to fill out the rest of the item slots, which means you had to spend way more time in battlegrounds on each character than in arena matches.

Loot drama can be one of the worst feelings. Hopefully whatever guild I end up in had a fair system.

Also, coffee will suppress the receptors that take in melatonin. So it's best to drink it well before you're tired. If you're ALREADY tired, it's will not be as effective. At least that's how I understood it.

Yeah that stun resist is really solid versus every class, especially with the proliferation of engineering in pvp these days. And its impossible to always have a FAP up, especially versus a class that can purge buffs. Maybe I'll just go orc since I like their aesthetic more anyways.

As someone who has worked on a game in a Disney IP. It would not do Blizzard good
---
I always forget that I'm thinking from a horde perspective, therefore alliance side might be different.
---
Anyways every damaging ability has a chance to trigger windfury.
---
Therefore bloodthirst, execute, whirlwind, OH etc. all can trigger  windfury and that's where a bulk of your rage later comes from when you mainly spam cleave/HS.
---
You want to spam it btw because special attacks only have a 9% base miss chance while white swings have a 28% miss chance. Therefore the more often you can use yellow abilities for autoswings (HS/Cleave) attacks the better.
---
I was talking from a DPS perspective as OP asked about DPS warrior: "Is dps warrior just as intensive?" :)
---
you're suggesting that's how realms work.  in your way, X would by synonymous with the server capacity, because why would you set it to anything less, you'd have empty server space and be wasting money
---
god, this subreddit is becoming so cringe
---
well whats you budget for 600$ or so you can get something pretty nice
---
for 400 you can get something pretty darn bad but it will still run classic

Warlock for sure if you're only planning on playing casually. Warriors require gear and you won't get that from a raid unless you join a DKP guild, which no one does anymore and no loot council guild will give a player that's rarely there any gear. You'd also be less on my priority to heal list as a warrior with a dungeon sword vs one with asscandy in a bg. At the very least, you can have fun in a bg with less gear as a warlock.
---
Btw, warlocks on alliance are just as terrifying with gear. Not everyone will be playing undead and WoTF isn't always off CD and you shouldn't be solo in a bg anyways.

You can play it decently on a 10 year old computer. Not sure what you are looking at.

You held a grudge against a player for winning loot he was able to put to good use while you were overleveled and admittedly wanted it to sit in your bank?
---
Mate, you are a pathetic human being if you conduct yourself in other situations like you did in that one.
---
Classic Content High Command contacted me and said i was on thin ice.
---
you asked and you shall receive.
---
I was unaware that Windfurry procced like that! And people complain about Ally having Paladin buffs 😉
---
&gt; your the idiot that would just run to the middle of the field and fight in WSG 
---
Optimal wsg groups absolutely had people controlling mid field. The worst noob move in wsg was defending flag room.
---
Viscidus not doable without Sapper Charges? What are you smoking?
---
Of course he's killable without them. He just can't be killed in the first wave of blobs without Sappers.
---
Damn, that’s real good stuff!
---
Hybrids are awkward for a number of reasons. First of all 90% of them are going to be forced to heal in raids. Lots of guilds will accept "meme" specs, and mine did at the time as well, but with current knowledge most people who want to do damage are going to roll a pure class. I expect the mage, rogue, warrior, and warlock population to be higher than in vanilla because of this. So now that you're raiding as a healer how do you farm your gold? Well you  can't do shit for damage so you either respec at ridiculously high costs or you roll an alt that takes several hundred hours to get to 60 just so you can farm. Playing a hybrid while being a good contributor to your guild and also not pulling your hair out in frustration just takes a larger commitment on the part of the player. Druid is just the worst class for this in classic imo simply because you have to put in so much time and effort to be not even close to as good as other classes. That said, holy crap do they become fun as hell in TBC. I actually had more fun in TBC playing my resto druid alt than I did raiding actual progression content on my one button hunter.
---
Never gave any xpac after wotlk more than a brief look and already bought 3 months of playtime in preparation for classic, yet to be activated. Plan to buy many more if classic hits home.
---
Where are you from and how is this legal?
---
How abour Last Guardian? By far my favorite
---
Joker the mage ninjad our first Nefarian kill - the loot was stacked for casters and that clown made his move. He stole the Staff of the Shadow Flame, Cloak of the Broodlord, Neltharion's Tear, the T2 mage robes, and the head. :(
---
it's funny to realize and remember how many classes had things you needed to depend on, happiness of pets, food for them, ammo, poisons, ingredients for abilities.
---
We r/wow boys.
---
Rank? NA?
---
IMO best leveling spec for priest is shadow.  This is the order I'll be speccing until I decide to respec deep into Holy for late game.
---
1-5 Wand Specialization
---
1-5 Spirit Tap
---
1-2 Imp. Shadow Word: Pain
---
1-3 Shadow Focus
---
1 Mind Flay
---
4-5 Shadow Focus
---
1-2 Imp. Psychic Scream
---
1-5 Shadow Weaving
---
1 Silence
---
1 Vampiric Embrace
---
1-3 Shadow Reach
---
1-5 Darkness
---
1 Shadowform
---
1-3 Imp. Power Word: Shield
---
1-2 Martyrdom
---
1 Inner Focus
---
1-3 Meditation
---
1 Imp. Power Word: Fortitude
---
1-3 Imp. Inner Fire
---
1-2 Imp. Mana Burn
---
How do you explain to your guild that you are not only using a meme spec, but you aren't even bringing the lotp buff cuz PvP?
---
You've spent too much time on private servers.
---
Nope, never was into twinking and stay on a x9 level. I want it for my hunter, should be easy to get and a nice upgrade.
---
There's a drop down box near the bottom that lets you switch between retail and classic. it's not highly visible
---
Paladin! Beefy as fuck and doesnt lose 1v1 thanks to bubblehearth
---
That's a valid concern, I guess.
---
Jump
---
And even that had its roots in Condor, before Blizzard bought 'em up.
---
Unfortunately I can't go paladins because .. FOR THE HORDE
---
Yeah, but CB is basically only worth the CD for eviscerate, which is a closer. I find that most of the time I'm ready to use evisc, I don't need the guaranteed crit to close the damage gap, anyways. So I'd argue that CB is pretty overrated, itself.
---
Be the warrior you want to be.  You can always make an alt if you get tired of it.
---
There are no "beefy" characters with few buttons that are good at 1v1 and simple.  Rogues are high skillcap and have a lot of buttons.  Shamans are doody at 1v1.
---
An spriest is pretty good at 1v1 and relatively simple/few buttons but I wouldn't call them beefy.
---
It’s the little things that make the game so great
---
It honestly is one of my most distinct memories from classic, unfortunately.  Every run of BWL had my hopes up.  Man those shoulders would just NEVER drop.  We had BWL on farm for months, progressing to 4Horsemen and Twin Emps in Naxx/AQ40, only saw those shoulders drop twice ever.  Once on my first time in BWL when I was new to the guild, having maybe 2-3 T2, and then when Irontiki got them maybe a full year later.  I pleaded with him and the guild that despite his marginally-higher dkp, the whole raid knew I was only in BWL for those shoulders and there was no other piece for me in there. I was about 15 at the time and remember just turning my computer off after chromaggus didn't even try to cover-up my rage quit.
---
I've been thrust into a de-facto GM position amongst my ~15 friends who are playing classic and I am making it an *official* rule that 7/8 on any tier set has priority on that 8th piece.
---
Yeah but the thing is I don't know if I want to be a warrior, I never played one. Is warrior really trash at 1v1s?
---
Rogue because you can avoid matchups that don't favor you.
---
GPU hardly matters at all with WoW. Almost all of the work is done by your CPU.
---
/r/buildapc
---
You're overthinking it the best guilds are benevolent dictatorships/oligarchies you really don't need much past a leader that wants to put in some time and some knowledgeable raid leaders who are reliably active and are comfortable giving orders. 
---
Don't delegate responsibilities or create officer positions that are unnecessary.  The worst guilds let just any long-term member have authority and are usually drama filled hellholes for it.  Keep the officer ranks lean and only put qualified folks in charge, never use them as any kind of a reward.  
---
Bottom line is always choose the least ammount of bureaucracy your guild can function under.
---
Lol, what? I'm not u/abrittain2401
---
Cemented my decision to roll a Druid over a Warlock or Priest. Thank you for the great content.
---
Wish we had short little videos like these for every class.
---
Gotcha. I’d just assume it would be too time consuming but I guess not.
---
56k....freaking 56k............ because i lived in the country. I was a shadow priest and absolutely dominate. Would just sit on LHC and bait 4-5 Grand Marshal rogues at a time. I would play at my friends house in town at time, and it was glorious! I could finally do AV and Arathi Basin (WSG was the only thing that didnt lag to hell).
---
I loved trolling people, not camping but just playing with them until they raged. It was my pasttime. The forum hate for was real and I relished it. Made friends just from how aggressive i was when i would refuse to afk a WSG against premades and still take down a few as the only person standing (MC helmed by top pvp guild leader during a WSG, and this earned me free passes in wpvp if they were 20v1 until the end of classic).
---
But at the end of the day, the 56k prevented me from achieving higher ranks in pvp or getting the best gear (Anathema would have looked so good on me) It's never left me that I could have achieved so much more. Now half my friends want to roll Spriest because watching me was all they remember. This time i have the internet speeds just not the time :) This time I will also be a drood.
---
no its me confusing attack with hs and changing target while hs is active also cancels
---
Not for FPS games.. but for everything else yeah it works perfectly fine.
---
Engineering is for super min-maxing and/or try-hards, OR because you like it.
---
By not taking it you might be at a disadvantage to certain players but it won't be the player base at large.
---
Shadow Priest is pretty strong and faceroll. Your buttons consist of Power Word: Shield (self explanatory - damage absorbing shield), Shadow Word: Pain (DoT), Fear (AoE CC), Mind Blast (Casted big damage), Mind Flay (Channeled damage and slow). These spells are all relatively straight forward and easy to understand. You can 1v5 warriors until they're phase 5/6 geared. I also feel the sPriest has less nuance to it then other classes like mage/warlock, so better for beginners. The main issue is mana problems, but you'll usually win a 1v1 before you're OOM. You also have a mana burn to make other people go OOM before you.
---
I was looking at it more for FPS actually lol
---
Very true for Classic and there is still much for me to discover, I‘m sure I have forgotten much after all this time.
---
Shaman or rogue would be fine. Priest and mage are easy to pick up as well. Mage will get you frustrated at spell pushback if you don't know what you're doing. 
---
Honestly they are all fairly easy to pick up. If you aren't going for world first raiding or r14 PvP anything you find enjoyable should be fine. That being said, I would stay away from warrior and druid. The stance dancing they both do, can get your completely melted if you dont time them right.
---
Get in a better guild, I guess?
---
We were always a tight knit crew, we raided and PvP'd together, so of course we wanted to do the best we could in both scenarios, so respecs were a given.  Guild PvP and guild PvE, we paid for respecs.
---
You want to go do your own shit solo and spec some oddball stuff, that's on you, but the vast majority of the stuff we did was basically a guild activity, and warranted being funded by the guild.
---
But go ahead and downvote me because your narrow personal experience is different.
---
I’m sure you’ll get lucky too some day
---
For leveling with a Warrior it's Shaman all the way. Race is personal preference IMO: Orc/Tauren better for PvP, Troll better for PvE.
---
Druid benefits more from Paladin buffs, but that's not that big of a deal.
---
Jump jump
---
This is what I wanted. Blizzard wanted it all, have the cake and eat it too. I would like to know what percent of their player base is legitimately interested in both versions of the game. I think it is very small. Especially how many classic only players waiting on the sidelines to sub because we hate retail. This is the population that will survive the tourist phase.  
---
8-10$ for each version separately would be much more fair to the consumer but blizzard is a greedy corporation that only makes changes based on profit potential or forced coercion from external forces.
---
Honestly we are only getting classic because the latter happened. Nostalrius proved that this product legitimately had enough demand that they could make enough profit with essentially no work or risk beyond the restoration and launch.
---
It’s a finished product, a large portion of players would be very unhappy if this changed. So they don’t have to do anything development wise, just maintain some extra servers and hire some techs. It’s essentially an extra million a month because no one can stop them from bundling these separate games together(based on a 200k classic player base)
---
It’s actually a huge advantage for Tauren warriors. The key thing you forgot is that warriors always want to be in melee range, while basically every other class will try to kite the warrior, and avoid melee range. 
---
For example a caster isn’t going to benefit from increased melee range. It’s only going to be a disadvantage for a caster fighting a Tauren warrior because now that Tauren can hit them from further away while they are trying to run.
---
More like 30 minutes a day here. 10-15 minutes total making bread meals (4 a day), and 15-20 minutes making dinner.
---
Figure out what you like doing most and find the character that fits that style of play:
---
If you like to sneak; a rogue or druid would fit that.
---
If you like to heal; a druid, shaman or priest.
---
If you want to just punch people; warrior, rogue, shaman, druid call can do that.
---
If you want to shoot things at people; mage, warlock, hunter, priest, druid.
---
If you like pets; hunter or warlock.
---
I would strongly suggest that you play what you think you will enjoy the most, rather than going for some hypothetical end game raiding minmaxing thing if it's your first time to the game.
---
&gt;In vanilla you saw the same people often especially if you leveled at a similar rate.
---
One reason to hate layering is this kind of thing will simply not happen.  If there are 4 layers you'll see them 25% of the time you normally would.
---
there should be no down time on any priest spec...
---
so long as you take spirt tap and wand spec
---
For a human warr who only needs 6 hit, this is the best cloak to be wearing 90% of the time until AQ. Its giving you over 1 crit more than the competition, vs a very small dps boost for the hunter. I would call this BiS pre phase 5 for tanking everything that isnt  all garr adds, broodlord and Chromag.
---
Lucky to get into a 40 man raid with 10 ppl? lol wut
---
Oh man. I remember actually really enjoying a set of warcraft novels but haven't been able to remember which ones for a long time. Bought War Crimes and Arthas and both felt more like fan service than quality novels.
---
But War of the Ancients.. I remember those really being able to pull you into the World instead of just reading like a background lore description or whatever. I'll have to get my hands on those again!!
---
To some degree my fear is its a huge success to the point that it washes out retail. If it gets to the point that 7/10 or more people are playing Classic my fear is that Activision will push Blizzard to add expansions raids onto the level 60 content, micro purchases, player housing, dual spec, pets , mounts or any other number of things for them to make a $. The whole reason the community at large was playing private servers was we wanted the OLD game exactly as it was. Unchanged. Before Blizzard turn it to shit after WOTLK. The fact is its a publicly traded company now and the old standards they held as a company in game development are now solely driven by stock price and earnings statements, not creativity and producing a quality product.
---
It's trash until you're 60 and geared. When you are, you're a fucking killing machine.
---
The only thing you'd really fucking miss is enemy cast bars.  I've always been an add on minimalist but I won't play this game without cast bars.
---
Just one advice OP. Don't listen to the shitters advertising 30-21. If you show up as a bear and don't have crit aura you will get laughed out of the raid. You are a hybrid and you can't halfass it. Don't listen to these people, whole-ass one thing instead of halfassing two. Also, bring pummelers and consumes or the raid will just have a fury warrior out on tank gear.
---
Its because youre usually working to build someone elses dream or income, and getting a very small percentage of the return spiritually and monetarily . You can legit be an entertainer for a living and if you become a slave to suits at a network the passion is immediately sucked out of it. Not to mention most people deal with some level of heavy disrespect and stress from 9 to 5...espescially in america.
---
The ideal life is to work, save money build your own shit up rather than retire at someone elses heel. Buy some off grid land, farm, hunt/fish for your food and put in natural work. Play WoW in a place that legit looks like a zone in WoW.
---
So i'm new to WoW entirely (joining some friends that used to play) and I've been wanting to play priest. I've been doing some reading and really have been struggling with deciding a spec.
---
Here they are:
---
Leveling: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=priest&amp;t=wlwPvjvkvlvmvnwQwRwSwpwAvYv4vQv0v1C8C9C_C.C~v2v3wgvRwXvVv7vXv5v6vTv_v.v~v-vqvwvxvrvvvtvgvCvDvovsvAvpvy
---
Endgame: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrsbbZf0tZVMGdMu
---
The goal of the first build is obviously to level haha. I'd want to mostly be a self sufficient but go down holy to be better able to heal my mates while leveling (especially on the later dungeons  40-50+). 
---
The goal of the second build is to be a versitile late game PvP priest. I still want to heal like dungeons too.
---
Do these trees look good?
---
&gt;Do they only care about retail?
---
I've been saying this forever and getting downvoted.  Yet people act like changes such as Layering are fine and Blizzard really really wants Classic to be successful.
---
I haven't done it, but I've watched videos of druids doing aoe farm in restro and stealth dungeon runs in feral for gold.  My understanding is they are slower than pure classes but better than other hybrids for farm.  Guess I'll find out in classic :)
---
I'm hoping to have a dps friend to farm elite demons with. I really want to get my eye of shadow out of the way early on, on my way to benediction.
---
Oh hey, a YouTube video that isn't 20 minutes of rambling and instead just gets right to the point. Nice.
---
My personal gem is running dungeons well past any gear that I need.
---
I prefer horde partly because of this aspect. Shamans are amazing in dungeons with windfury totem, mana tide totem, strength of earth. If the warrior and shaman are well geared, the shaman can go twist windfury and grace of air for another 3% crit for all melees in the group.
---
If you are well above the dungeon you can run with a twohander.
---
I did 2hand tanking in Zul'Farrak on pserver recently and did 45% of the groups DPS as tank. It's just so much fun.
---
However in raids paladins are alot better. You start to have aggro problems, especially in pugs with mediocre geared tanks and you need a plethora of shamans which you normally dont have.
---
One paladin grants his blessing to 40men, have 4 paladins and ale important blessings are covered for a 40men.
---
And blessings arent area sensitive. There are a lot of fights where you have to run back and forth to give your melee group tremor or strength and WF totem, but you have to heal from 40yards away to not be effected by AoE abilities like Magmadars AoE fear.
---
Alliance raiding is simply a lot more convenient while horde raiding is a lot like the faction itself: raw and brutal and very spikey in damage which can spiral out of control quickly, but for me personally it's also more fun. No better feeling than to trigger a few lucky WFs, spike, overtake your tank and sip a limited invulnerability potion to not topple over and lose all the buffs.
---
Start undead is the biggest hellhole on earth due to all the nets and silences, sincerely your tank.
---
It's totally doable. Not question about it. I always kept addons to a minimum. Also, arena doesn't exist in classic (other than Grubashi Arena)
---
I had an addon called Comix that featured a jump counter, and I had jumping contests outside the Orgrimmar AH.
---
Good for you !
---
I remember places like STV on a PvP server and Elite Voodoo Trolls in Jintha'Alor or something that were quite the challenge.
---
Epic mount one a casual schedule was kind of a feat in itself too
---
You can't transfer accounts between regions. You can make a new WOW account under the same Battle.NET account. That's it.
---
Legolasbq
---
This game invokes so much emotion. It can really feel hurtful when things go the wrong way. Hopefully in classic all the drama will run off my back like water. So sorry for your trauma.
---
Try it out; the trial has no time limit and allows you to play to 35. As I said, it has a long GCD and the main story is non-optional. It’s designed to be a game you play as a journey, not blazing straight to max level to raid. 
---
The gameplay speeds up significantly towards max level as you get abilities which are off the GCD and some of the faster jobs tend to be in excess of 50 or 60 CPM. Many players consider the first 50 levels to be an extended tutorial, but with level sync, even the lower level group content always remains relevant.
---
This is where we let it out lol
---
That was me in original classic because I was like 12 and that was easy enough for me to do and learn to play with my older brother.
---
Well, if you include breakfast, lunch, and dinner along with the wait to get those food it can really add up.
---
Of course it depends on whether you prepare your own food or eat out, but even then it can still add up unless you fill up on frozen food and junk food. :)
---
Every mmo I have played the first 5 or 6 names I try are already taken. One of those times I subbed early and STILL had to settle for a butchered name (wildstar launch). The cost is irrelevant to me. The chance at having a normal name without crazy characters is worth it.
---
Healing as a priest is a lot easier than healing as a shaman. Shaman mana issues plague the class from 0-60.
---
Horde all the way!!
---
Standard warlock PvE is also pretty bad since it puts 21 points into demo, 7 points into affliction and the rest into a few PvE talents in the destruction tree.
---
People can be so clueless. And with a name like that I expect that memory to last a long time
---
Moo-ooom! MOAR HOT POCKETS
---
In order to get the name reservation, you have to have an active sub. The name reservation is exactly 2 weeks before the launch of the game. 2 weeks is exactly half of the game time you get when you subscribe. One half of $15 is $7.50. He wont be using the game time for anything BUT the name reservation so to him its costing him $7.50 to reserve a name and he said thats well worth it. If he instead waited until the game launched to subscribe, he would get the full $15 worth and waste nothing.
---
I quit my job and will be off for launch. You'll find me playing the shit out of classic and stressing out about making rent as an unemployed boi ;)
---
Why did you capslock a quote?
---
I can understand why you don't see the need for class leaders, your definition of "X Officer" encompasses it.  I simply disagree that there are many people out there who are able/willing to fill that role as you describe, and that class leaders will instead be a more common way of splitting the work up since it's a much smaller responsibility.  This just gets compounded further the larger the guild is and the more people who need bandwidth from their superior.
---
Ninjas seem to be an overwhelming source of drama. I wish every one who ninjas gets a big Scarlett N on their characters.
---
Reaching 60 in that time will require very focused effort. I suggest that you 1) pick an easy solo leveling class (eg hunter), and 2) create a rough plan of what you are going to do and when. Also, make sure you hit the grocery store before you start. 
---
Since you don’t have a ton of time to spend in the endgame, I would recommend taking the leveling experience slower as well. Might be more fun overall. Either way you do you. Classics gonna be sick!
---
This must be sarcasm? Like I'm not a fan of that movie either, but the prequels are embarrassingly bad.
---
Most hilarious post I’ve seen in a while.
---
Its a shame fist weapons arent as viable as other weapon types. I actually have a question for ya about The Behemoth, since you farmed him. Did you find his respawn timer to be rather quick? Ive heard people say its extremely low, but dont know whether this is true or not.
---
Wouldn’t surprise me if it was right before name reservation
---
Why would I sub before release?
---
Tried many leveling specs. Wand Spec 5/5 then  Spirit Tap 5/5 and rest into Shadow. At level 40 respec and dump everything until you have Shadow form, spend every additional points in the Disc tree starting with getting your wand spec back. At 60 respec since you don't need points on Spirit Tap and Wand spec at max level.
---
Ouch. Kinda reminded me that I got my Bloodfang shoulders as the last piece from chromagus and damn it took like 15 runs
---
The chance of a proc isn't reliable enough. Do the math, just don't wepswap unless running and no corruption targets.
---
Haha the spriest glory is great. I too played on 56k and until reading your post I didn't realize I still hold a grudge against it lol
---
Yeah i was actually in disbelief when i found out there were that many rares in the game. In that sense its more than fair that they mostly drop greens.
---
I could never win a roll for the strat ud xbow... I got the Mr Domo leaf before I got it.  I hated everyone who rolled and won it... Mostly the warriors.
---
They're all alright. Tides of darkness was fine but forgettable. Rise of the horde and Arthas are probably the best of the 4.
---
Somebody with some business acumen finally. The economic point of Classic WoW is to lure people like me back into the Activision Ecosystem who for one reason or another completely swore off all Actiblizz games long ago. I stopped playing WoW with Cataclysm, and spit at the entire company's feet when Diablo III came out as the disappointment of the decade.   
---
This is Blizzard's final chance to start sucking money out of me again. I'll never spend a single cent on anything but classic wow, but there are PLENTY of people similar to me who will start playing classic, and after being enticed on the launcher enough, will be like "hm, maybe I'll try this other shooty game." And that will be that, another heavy user converted over from Blizz's little side project.   
---
Everyone in this thread who thinks subs make money don't understand the contemporary gaming environment. The goal is to make the most money through the least effort. Someone with an active sub actually playing the game means you have to support that user. You need to spin up VMs to give users a game environment, you need to pay support staff to handle tickets, you need to pay the damn electric bill. If you can just engineer your game to be appealing "enough" so that people play a few weeks, give you 60-100 dollars, and then stop playing until the next tantalizing content drop, you've got the winning formula. Online Game Design used to be about creating something so addictive the users wouldn't *stop* playing it. Now the entire point is to get you to log on, pay for your dopamine hit, and then fuck off so you'll stop stressing the infrastructure.  
---
Look to mobile games. Mobile games were derided by "true gamers" for years and years so we didn't pay attention to them. Meanwhile they were just straight up money factories. You think a moneyman is gonna look at a minimal-cost product that seemingly prints money from nothing and they're not gonna want a piece of that pie? There is a *reason* all game design has followed mobile's lead for the past 10 years.
---
well let me offer you an alternative way of thinking to ease your anger. irontiki had more dkp? Then he obviously attended more than you, or passed up those 7/8 other pieces. the guild rule sounds silly to me when you've also got DKP going, honestly just sounds like a mess of a guild. why are you mad at him for using his dkp? If that was a rule that he cant roll when someone else is 7/8 then shouldnt you be mad at the rule maker for not enforcing it? Or the officers of the guild? Doesnt sound like his fault at all
---
While completely correct, I hate the way this reads... lol.
---
You lost me at Imp. SWP.
---
I think you might be right in terms of sheer objectivity overall, which has me reconsidering.   
---
But I think being able to crush locks/priests (I'm expecting more locks compared to vanilla since everyone knows how powerful they'll be in Naxx gear) and the class fantasy of undead rogue will have me sold.  
---
I'm still debating whether my 3rd character will be hunter or rogue anyway XD (I'm playing Druid/Shadow Priest primarily, but planning 3 characters in total to play one with my wife, a buddy and solo)
---
Them giving beta keys to all the popular streamers was huge marketing.
---
It would probably be to prevent farming of quest items that could be stockpiled for over a year and then used all at once during the War Effort, or sold on the AH for exorbitant amounts.
---
Quest hubs in Searing Gorge and Hinterland are just for leveling and they have no end-game significance.
---
Oh man I did not even think about this flaw in layering. I just thought about how bad it was for rare materials. But it totally changes the leveling experience.
---
Your Healing BIS for a long time will be a bright blue cloth Robe...and nobody wants to see a blue Robe on a Tauren...
---
On the otherhand on Horde are in general less Druids and less Healer... 
---
Your Desicion
---
I firmly believe it will be right before or right after name reservation.
---
Will do!
---
Brack pointing at sub numbers after you sub: "look, people are joining for the new raid!  We don't need Classic!" *Sweats nervously*.
---
Raiding without a threat meter could be a problem
---
Haha
---
We used archetype leaders. Tank, heal, ranged dps, melee dps. Made no sense to have a class officer when you’ve got 1-3 of a class.
---
I love getting to Tanaris at level 3 as a NE. Take the boat to the marsh and swim south for 20 minutes. (Watch out for that fucking shark) The goblins at the shore sell some good stuff, and when you die you will rez close to Gadget and get the FP and some rare recipes before anyone else. Put them on the AH for some easy money. 
---
Fly back every now and then to stock up and sell more. EZ Throw Dynamite II, the Transmutes, the cooking ones from the coastal goblins.
---
&gt;Read the title of the tread again and tell me again how any of what you're saying even matters.
---
Oh god, the title is literally "What people consider "ninja looting". *Not* "what does the word ninja mean". He *knows* it the word ninja is, he is asking when it is considered to be ninja looting. He literally says "So how can you decide what is "ninjaing" ?" in his original post. How daft can you be to not understand this? I'm literally laughing out loud right now. It's just so hilarious that you are saying *I'm* the one that doesn't understand thing and ask me to read OP's text again when you are so terribly wrong about it.
---
The pet responsiveness thing will most likely get fixed, but the others (leeway, DR between Scatter/Trap) are not bugs, and rather just a feature of patch 1.12.
---
lul imagine going hardcore in a casual MMO like wow
---
No shit. It's been so long I don't remember much of it.
---
My only level 60 back in the day was a Tauren warrior and it’s so good for PvP the hitbox seems like it makes a big difference. For example I remember mages freezing me in BG’s but still being able to hit them in the back before they could run away and kite me.  The negative about being a Tauren is that it often feels like everyone in the BG is targeting you first.
---
They call it The Pacifier because it puts its users to sleep. Ret pally weapon i guess lol.
---
you don't want mobs to survive that long true, but you're also a paladin, and water isn't infinite soooooo
---
There's more to it than just the Rank gear. Look into the reputation gear for the Battleground factions.
---
If you're trying to achieve the best gear possible then raiding is pretty much the final answer. If you can somehow achieve rank 13/14 and get that gear it would be significant.
---
Other than that, do whatever is fun. It might take you longer to gear up, you may never have access to the best of the best, but if it's fun it won't matter as much, imo.
---
Pony tail man BAD!
---
No one is arguing against Imp Shout being a lackluster talent. He was questioning how you can regard Imp Rend as a good talent when it has a similar effect to Imp Shout which you write off as a very minor bonus.
---
You're correct when you it's more efficient, but that doesn't really answer the question he was asking.
---
Yeah I'm definitely weird. Nothing won't with that. But being afraid to be weird is a fate I wouldn't wish on my enemy and I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
---
I blame the King Priest.
---
This one is more of a wholesome rivalry than a grudge, but I think it works...
---
My 3 IRL friends and I joined an alliance raiding guild the week before their first MC attempt.  We raided with them for months all the way through MC, through BWL, and into AQ40.  Then the guild started to have problems.  Our lock and rogue officers went to a further progressed guild, which meant we lost two of our best geared players, including our only Thunderfury holder.  I had become decent friends with them along the way, so I actually wasn't too upset by that though.  They put in more effort to be ready for raids than any of us, and really we were holding them back.  
---
But this started a cascade.  We lost our priest officer and a few other key people, but the one that I remember most was the warrior officer. 
---
There had been selective server transfer options for a while from populated realms to unpopulated ones, but they had just opened up the once in a character lifetime paid transfers.  This was actually the first shot fired in the downfall of WoW, all the way back in vanilla IMO, but that is a different story.  Later they allowed a transfer every 6 months or something, and now you can do as much as you want. 
---
Anyways this warrior wanted better BG queue times, and had an offer from a friend's guild on another server, so he said "thanks for everything" and left.  He went to a server that I randomly had a horde alt on, but my priest was only level 30 or so at the time.  I stayed and raided with my alliance guild for a while, but eventually got tired of trying to rebuild back to where we were.  One night a level 58 mage, who was someones friend or something, got 6 pieces from MC.  Which would have been a great help for BWL farming and eventually progression raiding if we ever saw him again....  I just got tired of it and considered quitting altogether, but then my IRL friends and I decided to switch focus to those horde alts.
---
We leveled up and focused on the PVP grind.  I hit rank 10, got into the main honor grinding group on horde side, and was pushing rank 11.  Then in one WSG there that warrior was....  my group said to watch out for him specifically because he was very well geared and a good player, I told them I was there and remember him getting his weapon because the other warriors made fun of him for dual wielding.  So the BG started, and this warrior was playing well, he had new AQ gear, and that same orange claw from BWL, he also had a pally healing him.  But my group was all rank 10 and up, some of the guys were in AQ gear and one even had some Naxx stuff, more importantly there were more of us, so we crushed them.  I got a bunch of screenshots of his dead body, and the final score screen.  
---
I never actually quit the alliance guild, just sort of stopped coming to raids, so I went back to their forums and posted what I had got.  This was months later, so the guild looked quite a bit different, and it was all in good natured fun.
---
I saw him again in the world alone one time and melted him pretty good, shadow priests are awesome in vanilla.
---
Later in early TBC I was playing a mage and ganked him once in the world.  A while later I saw him again and started a fight, His gear was much better, he had the highest rank of that crafted mace, the one that required a bunch of mats from raids.  Anyways I kitted him around until he was almost dead and he potted.  No problem though, I still had lots of life and was kitting him very well.  But then in flies (the second shot fired in the downfall) a pally who LOHs him, and freedoms him, and I got crushed.  That was the last I saw of him, no idea where he is now, but I will always remember the warrior that deserted us, only to meet again in another world.
---
Layering removed ASAP and/or completely minimized.  IMO layering is the antithesis of the Classic experience and needs to be gone.
---
I don't pay that much attention to the details as long as the story is entertaining. I'm a Horde guy but Arthas is probably one of the best out of the dozen or so I've read. It's a quick enjoyable read. Would recommend.
---
I was in a guild called Clan Seppuku and the GM held the rank Daimyo and the officers were Shogun. I pointed out that this was backwards and the GM insisted I was wrong. I insisted back and got kicked. I still wonder if he ever figured out he was an idiot.
---
I really hope Blizz doesn't just set up these launch phases and then hang Classic out to dry. IMO it is the type of game that they can just release a new server or two every two years and it will still draw 40-50,000 players on a daily basis.

I remember using widows remorse from naxx to dump rage with hs :)
---
I‘ve used both razed synapse and Logitech gaming software. You’ll need a mouse with the capability to use mouse macros and most modern gaming ones already have the capability
---
what are you worried about?
---
Not bad. I strongly prefer throwing weapons at 10 to crossbows: they take up 1 less inventory spot and you are goiing to ironforge anyways (the gnome trains thrown weapons in timberline arms and then they sell them on the lower floor). 
---
I will note, you want to do hogger if possible before leaving elwynn, as it is the only real source of green mail pants for alliance quests at this low of a level, and is well worth doing. I would also get over to the lighthouse earlier, as the lighthouse has the 4 part kill quest, and those mobs grey out if you wait to pick up the quest until murk eye. 
---
You also want to do the captain sander's quest, as silver is actually very valuable for a warrior as it lets you buy the silvered bronze armor from blacksmiths: the main rare ingredient is silver. 
---
I would really try to do the elite quests on your last redridge circuit: tharil'zun is going to give you a near BIS weapon for that level, and is probably easily 5 mannable if you already have a healer, and yowler gives you basically the only low level alliance melee ring you can get. 
---
Also, don't skip deadmines. It not only gives you the chausses of westfall, but you also need it to do the next big ring quest, the seal of wrynn (it's the letter van cleef drops).  
---
Basically, I would strongly suggest you to aggressively do elite quests at low level, because it's quite practical to do so. The priest pulls aggro and runs, the warrior hamstrings and rends, and then the mob just slowly runs towards the priest, and you just keep dpsing it.
---
&gt; if they did that then a lot of people would leave the original servers and eventually they would be really low pop or even dead. 
---
And what will happen if they don't do that?
---
Good on you. Don't let this lonely reject project his shitty  existence onto you.
---
That's really only an issue for warriors due to the mechanics of the game.
---
Reminds me of Starcraft 2.
---
Well I do have a new case where this person came into my reminiscent post where many people are sharing similar memories, and then shit on me personally. So now I'm going huge behind their dryer and stay 1/2 of all pairs of socks
---
people freaking out over addons that they 100% would have used if they were around during classic. haters gonna hate.
---
Btw, I’m not really one into twitch and all that but I like your video style.
---
I think it’s the Stoicism in the Druid lore, as to why we are generally cool and laid back.
---
And trigore right next door. 
---
Maybe he was trying to avoid elites that are just outside dungeons.
---
That was TBC though, so unsure.
---
As a future tank in Classic, every single GS user goes on my blacklist.
---
I wish them good luck playing Classic outside solo play, with their GS, because I can bet all my gold that most, if not all tanks will do the same.
---
It's good when companies know who their true patrons are.
---
Doesn't always work, I got carpal tunnel and weightlifting really makes it worse for me, but very light stuff helps.
---
What kind of talent build are you going to level with?
---
No, it felt larger than it was and flying ruined the illusion. And I heavily enjoyed WPvP on paper era
---
Yep, it needs to fly under the radar at investor calls but also be big enough to continue supporting for the long haul Naxx+ or TBC
---
There's only two things I can't stand.
---
People who are intolerant of others.
---
And the Welsh.
---
I can't wait for us to meet come classic launch, I think you would be a good addition to my WPvP montage video :)
---
Can't you see he's the man! Let me hear you applaud! He is more than a man, he's a shiny golden god!
---
That might actually be better. Theres a bunch of context you would be missing or would require awkward exposition dumps for things to make sense with sylvanas in the lead.
---
PvE monsters are computers doing what their programmed to do, and are usually purposely weaker than the player to make the experience smooth but challenging, so the number game is much more enjoyable and far less frustrating.
---
Other people choose how to engage you with the goal of a guaranteed kill, so they will purposely look for fights where they have the overwhelming advantage like going to a zone 10 levels below theirs to kill the lowbies, or form a raiding party to kill quest-givers, or twink their characters so the stats disparity is as wide as it can be. 
---
I don't really see PvE and PvP as comparable experiences because one is purpose built for your enjoyment while the other is purposely exploited to your detriment for others enjoyment.
---
PvP does become much more enjoyable at max level though once the number disparity from one person to the next shrinks so it feels much more of an even playing ground.
---
Well. I’ve landed on rogue. I’ve decided I can’t pass up control in Wpvp and being able to vanish when caught off guard. I usually would be going horde. However, I am going Alliance. Human Dwarf or Gnome. I’m thinking Dwarf.
---
Ah, but were you in a raid where a hunter saved a wipe because he feigned and used jumper cables on the priest that had died?
---
It's an issue for every class that can't dispel them
---
The reasons don't matter. If the group expects you to get the item, but I take it, I'm a ninja. Period.
---
&gt;I keep seeing comments on how Layering is good because it'll "solve starting zone mob competition".
---
&gt;No - that's Sharding.
---
The benefits of layering are the same as sharding, it just isn't zone specific. To say one of the primary benefits of layering is to solve starting zone congestion is 100% true.
---
I'm pretty sure that SoR and downranked Consecration gives far more single target threat per mana than max rank Consecration with JoW and SoW. And if you're running with a pug with idiots, straight up judging SoR instead of going for JotC or JoW is often a necessity.
---
Be a gnome so you can accidentally fall in a tiny puddle and drown.
---
I just looked that up and it looks like he was doing that in the Burning Crusade. Do you have an example of him doing it before BC launched?
---
I wish bitch slapping over TCP/IP protocol was a thing.
---
Questie is ported to Classic and will do the same thing basically.
---
Paladin is probably the best decision, but sans that hunters and rogues are at least both somewhat intuitive. They both have definite skill curves though. Healers are also always liked. Three minute mage is also a pretty simple starting point.
---
Both me and you brother, I loved being able to switch around wherever/ whenever I was needed. I'm super stoked for the end of August
---
I have been struggling with Arthas. I read the 8-9 books before it and I’ve just been stuck on this one. It’s not dragging me in like the others.
---
May I ask you what lead you to write that and ruin everyone's day?
---
To be somewhat fair to them having to review an MMO expansion is pretty much a hopeless task, you can't account for the content's longevity, which is one of the most important factors. WoD was fine at the start, but became really fucking bad once you were done with the initial stuff and entered the loop, not an easy thing for reviewers to catch.
---
Will it be harder to find dungeon groups or raidspots on the horde side as a druid? This is the impression I get from YouTubers like Skarm and Ebbn.
---
Nope. That doesn't make sense anyway as they're 2 systems attempting to solve 2 different problems.
---
Imagine you're assigned Illidan - Layer 1 and you're in Elwynn Forest.
---
Without Sharding, you will suffer congestion and mob tagging competition regardless.
---
This will probably get deleted because it isn't really... related to WoW. 
---
If you check top posts from this week, literally two days ago someone made a post benchmarking PC performance. Basically, if you have ANY computer with a stand alone graphics card built since 2010, you will be cruising at 60+ FPS at 1920x1080. 
---
You can play on a 2010 laptop and run off the integrated CPU and still get 30 FPS. 
---
So.. you can basically buy any ~$500-$600 computer that has any type of gpu whatsoever. You do not need anything even remotely recent, frankly no reason to even go beyond like a GTX 760.
---
Ok, I get that people are upset with my question.  Why are people downvoting me for agreeing that this evidence counters my previous assumptions?
---
good to know
---
Thank you kind stranger for my first Reddit Silver!!!!
---
I am now 1 silver closer to getting my mount at 40!
---
If you do a more expensive laptop, go for something with a 1050ti or 1660ti GPU.  You'll have to really dig around for deals, but you can find something [like this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dell-g3-15-gaming-laptop/8thnj2tttgfc?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=iH2PRtf%2fI7g&amp;ranEAID=lw9MynSeamY&amp;ranSiteID=iH2PRtf_I7g-.J88_ulYLVsI5CUpYaz2Dw&amp;ranSiteID=lw9MynSeamY-zwt4IjEV2x7nmt7KWL_bYA&amp;epi=iH2PRtf_I7g-.J88_ulYLVsI5CUpYaz2Dw&amp;epi=lw9MynSeamY-zwt4IjEV2x7nmt7KWL_bYA&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__ethdulmwaskfrgux0higqpq2m22xjlqybd2nwc9k00)(7593)(1243925)(iH2PRtf_I7g-.J88_ulYLVsI5CUpYaz2Dw)()&amp;tduid=(ir__sgdmx1exdckfrzs0xkyc9pw9y32xjivuqnytmyku00)(7593)(1243925)(lw9MynSeamY-zwt4IjEV2x7nmt7KWL_bYA)()&amp;irclickid=_ethdulmwaskfrgux0higqpq2m22xjlqybd2nwc9k00&amp;irclickid=_sgdmx1exdckfrzs0xkyc9pw9y32xjivuqnytmyku00&amp;activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) that is perfectly fine and will have no trouble.  I'm not too familiar with the Ryzen APUs, but I seem to remember those are on par with the 1050ti and 1660 or slightly worse?
---
But the best way is to dig around on Youtube and basically type in your game name +laptop GPU and you should find something where someone is playing the game with FPS counter on.  
---
From what i saw, you could play fortnite on an intel HD GPU, but it's going to be 30fps and a super low resolution.
---
I'm only looking for a cheap laptop when I get stuck going somewhere, I don't have to bring my SFF computer (6700k, 980ti) that has monitor/case/kb and mouse all in a backpack.  Or something where I can do grinding on the couch and watch TV.
---
Dead DPS = boss lives longer = more damage taken
---
Shroud will be playing Classic as well. I believe Ninja, Summit, and pretty much every top streamer will be playing it as well.
---
Really means a lot man thank you so much. Just started doing YouTube last week. I kind of got fed up with all the negativity with druids and wanted to showcase that they can in fact be a good class if played right.
---
Best of luck to you in Classic!
---
well yeah but where did you read there would be sharding in lowbie zones?
---
Enjoy getting owned by mages and hunters without imp sprint. Sf dagger was ok in 2005, now it‘s a meme.
---
If I do decide to get it, I'll be subbing before character creation - haven't subbed in about 4 years now.
---
But he has at least 1 share in each company, so he totally knows everything about them.
---
This is coompletely false. It proves you guys advocating for Layering don't even understand what it's for the in the first place.
---
It has nothing to do with mob competition. It's to accomodate for influx of tourists long term. Starting zone congestion is what's sharding is there for.
---
holy shit classic wow was a mistake
---
Yeah that one you linked looked like it’s going to be the winner. Thanks for your help
---
S1/2 SLSL + Holy Paladin, S3/4 SLSL + Druid
---
They’re a lot smarter and more positive than people give them credit for. Yeah, sometimes teenagers can be dicks, but overall they are really inspiring and make the days fun. I do a lot of hands on tasks with my students rather than your stereotypical lecture math class. We use manipulatives, 3D printers, and do experiments. I love what I do and I find it highly rewarding. It’s a way better life than non teachers would perceive it to be. It just takes the right kind of person. If you don’t have a lot of patience, it would be easy to hate the job. If you want to make a difference and be the change you want to see in the world, I can’t think of a better occupation. 
---
Even if it eats all my classic wow time ;)
---
This is a really stupid article and doesn't qualify as journalism. 
---
Disney is publicly traded. I own shares of Disney. It trades for like $13 a share. I'm a "Disney Investor", and I think the guy who wrote this article probably needs to find a new job, because unless that "Disney Investor" is a very major hedge fund or Goldman Sachs, their opinion is totally irrelevant.
---
KTM threat meters is essential if you are raiding. Threat is a very real isuue in classic and dps need to be mindful if they are about to pull off a tank. Later raids after MC have bosses that aren't tauntable, so if you pull threat you can get the raid killed real fast.
---
Yeah, when it comes time to drop tailoring for engineering, it might be worth it to just hold on to tailoring if you've already gathered a stockpile of mats from mining and don't need it anymore to level engi.  
---
Being tailoring/eng isn't the worst combo, but I also plan on doing some of the longer rep farms like frostsaber and having a gathering profession will likely make more gold than tailoring.
---
&gt;Nope. That doesn't make sense anyway as they're 2 systems attempting to solve 2 different problems.
---
Layering is quite literally the evolution of sharding. It uses **shards** to expand server size as needed to ensure stability for the players. You just aren't randomly phasing in and out. Layers are basically continent wide shards.
---
Hunters are going to hate Tauren warriors and enhancement shamans. 
---
Hunter dead zone is 5 to 8 meters.
---
Tauren melee range is up to 7 meters. (does not apply to transformed druids)
---
Tauren can dps inside the dead zone.
---
Points are scarce and the incremental buff is insignificant. A 20% chance to miss out on 3% dmg is meaningless when it's all but guaranteed next spell cast will proc.
---
Layering "working as intended" still reduces recurring player interaction and immersion, and the effects of that, however minor, will linger.
---
The other similar memories (most of them anyway) are legit "Yeah...that sucks" situations for those people. Yours was 100% not justified in any way. In your situation, you openly said you were going to put the item in your bank and just hoard it. If you were still planning on using it, than I could understand being a bit annoyed, but not annoyed enough to literally hold a grudge against a stranger who did nothing wrong for 6 months. That's a bit troubling.
---
Also, I don't really wear socks that often.
---
Sorry, i misread.  Prot warriors would take pants off, not DPS warriors.
---
If you're doing loot council you probably want class leads to help limit drama. Suppose your mDPS lead happens to be a rogue, and all the shared non-tier that rogues and furies both prize consistently goes to rogues instead of furies. Even if that's the right call for whatever reason(s), it's going to cause drama. If you have both rogue and fury representatives on the LC, at least the fury lead can manage his group's morale as a legitimate member of that group.
---
I totally get this man, one thing I say to the people who ask me about Classic druid who've never had the chance to play them: They are SO different than every other expansion INCLUDING TBC. If they do release a TBC2, I'd be curious to see how many people would play/main druid compared to classic
---
Again, we're talking about a guy with an actual injury here. He's not going to be grinding his way to High Warlord. He just wants to play the game without taxing his arms too much.
---
Prove they're doing sharding.  No one here believes you.
---
Wasn't a problem in vanilla. Guess we'll see what percent of players are hardcore pserver players.
---
I'm not sure I'm reading this correctly.
---
Do you think there's going to be sharding AS WELL as layering? Cause that's not what is going to happen. Layering was chosen instead of sharding.
---
oh man i honestly dont remember, 14 years ya know, all i remember was i didnt spend loads of time getting it, apart from ppl entering BRD it was a pretty empty place to wait for the respawn and got the slicer rather easy.
---
Yep.
---
Point 3 FTW.
---
Nice video. Liked and subscribed, give me more
---
See: World of Warcraft Vanilla.
---
I used to raid on my Warlock back in the MC/Onyxia days with no addons. Was fun.
---
lolwut
---
How is having less people in the same place as you *not* helping to solve any kind of zone congestion / competition?
---
Imagine if your sleep was that small 😂
---
I've never paid attention but is AV reward ammunition etc. any good or even competitive?
---
Well, why not take some days off?
---
I'm waiting to resub until at least less than a month out. I'm not interested in BfA so there isn't any reason for me to sub just yet.
---
There won't be sharding in classic, everyone was screaming about sharding thats why they invented layering
---
&gt; Sharding will exist in all starting zones across all Layers
---
[Citation Needed]
---
Druids have almost always been rare, though I get the feeling from these boards everybody wants to play a feral one. Dwarf priests almost always get a spot, though fear ward is entirely not necessary.
---
In all fairness... couldn’t it be the case that the hunter was just new and didn’t fully understand the game mechanics yet? If he were a 60 hunter that would be completely different, but I think all new players make at least one bone-headed move. And I agree with the other poster that wanting something to sit in your bank isn’t a valid reason to need it. A better solution would have been to create the group, tell everyone up front that you were reserving the staff for yourself, and that if someone didn’t like it they could find a different group.
---
Yeah, these are just examples. I could see a guild of pvpers possibly doing this as they wouldn't have to respec. Most people will likely stay pve specced though or pay for respecs
---
Claim to be moonglow:)
---
I hope so.  Many people are willfully ignorant to the MANY problems layer causes towards being in a cohesive world, worldpvp, and immersion.
---
&gt;It has nothing to do with mob competition. It's to accomodate for influx of tourists long term.
---
**THESE ARE RELATED**. Accommodating for tourists means you have servers that are much larger than normal. This means you're going to have way more players than the server can physically support in the starting areas (i.e. no ones going to be able to kill anything to progress UNLESS you break people up into SHARDS, AKA LAYERS).
---
I don't think you even understand what you're saying at this point. Layers **are literally shards**, but they don't phase players in and out on a whim.
---
Hunter probably has the lowest skill cap in the game and one of the highest skill ceilings. In other words, it's easy to get kills with a hunter, but the class improves exponentially as you improve as a player. They're also the easiest class level.
---
ffxiv is like bfa.
---
Same shit game, same shit players.
---
The only difference is in the game title.
---
&gt; my friends and I cant find information on if theres going to be multiple servers to choose from 
---
Try actually looking then...
---
I've never really played Hunter but I love that they're this cool mix of being fun and easy to play, but also having a really high skill ceiling for things like soloing, kiting, PvP in general. I literally didn't even realize mend pet was added in TBC. That's a whole additional level of complexity there...
---
&gt; enhancement shamans
---
Don't think anyone hates playing against enhancement shamans
---
Cataclysm was the great homogenizer. Wrath just streamlined already in place design.
---
there will be multiple servers yes
---
PvP, RP, and PvE 
---
there will be several of these, not sure how many yet but at least one per time zone im guessing
---
maybe not RP
---
I’ve played both extensively and, while they play *much* differently, I’d say you gain as much as you lose either way.  I like the risk of a PvP server, but when people are allowed to be assholes they will be.
---
I’m generally a pacifist, so I’ll never gank a person who is minding their own business.  But you better believe that I’ll fight back, assist my faction, and make life a living hell for habitual gankers.
---
Come phase 2, people will flag themselves on PvE servers.  I will have my PvP flag up at all times because there will be much less competition for honor on a PvE server.  If I snag a few kills from people who try to gank me and fail miserably, I’ll be ahead of the curve and rank up.  It’s literally no different than I play on a PvP server since I don’t pick fights.  It just takes a few people fighting for world PvP to break out and a SS/TM scale battle to take place.  And when you’re sick of it, wait 5 mins and go back to PvE.
---
My *only* regret being on a PvE server was BG queues when they were server specific.  AV would only pop on AV weekend and populations were so skewed toward alliance that queue times were an hour.  Blizzard has announced cross server BGs, so my biggest gripe about a PvE server is gone.
---
Bottom line, if you like world PvP be the change you want to see.  Flag up and let people pick fights with you.  I’m certainly going to attack flagged alliance on my PvE server because they are clearly looking for a fight.  PvP should be consensual!
---
Not really you just damage through it just like any class with a heal.
---
How do druids hold up in Wpvp and bgs?
---
Buy a bunch of Tupperware and meal prep the weekend before launch. Freeze like 40 healthy meals and heat them up on flight paths. Sleep when you’re dead.
---
If a server divides into 3 shards at launch then it will lessen the amount of players in every zone. So it will help mob competition, just not as much as sharing. Also show your source that says sharing will be used in low level zones.
---
&gt; I play on a BC private server and gearscore is alive and well 
---
...and people say TBC is a better Vanilla...
---
Fools...
---
&gt; and it will be in classic too. 
---
Nope.
---
Go back and read the dev interviews. They're not implementing sharding.
---
Instead of sharding the starter zones they decided to implement layering.
---
Do you NEED it? No. But it will be super useful as a hunter, even more so than other classes.
---
wow, you must be so damn miserable to be so cynical. go hug your mom, bro
---
Hey that's also an acceptable way to read that xD if it makes you feel any better I was reading it the same way typing it out.
---
Blizzard banned players for using Arctium.

You sound like a way bigger dick than the hunter, if that's the point you're trying to convey.
---
We're talking about a guy with an actual injury here. He's not going to be grinding his way to High Warlord. He just wants to play the game without taxing his arms too much, and Hunters are pretty good for that given how much power is in the pet.
---
very cool, i would love to see one of each class symbol

Bring the shadow 6, etc.
---
Thanks for doing it so fast! I hate when People have a 10 minute clip just to say 11 rare spawns (Vaulty, fuck that idiot)
---
Dude what guild? That name is familiar and I was on frostmane
---
So....will you run BRD with 3 PuG rogues if they have a good GS?

GOOD LUCK MATE !

most of it has been retconned tho :(
---
just read the WoW cronicles
---
I wonder if Disney can just work its properties into an RPG wherever it wants. WoW is a competing product with Square Enix products which should own the rights to putting Disney characters in RPG games.
---
I thought he did it through both, could be wrong though. It's been years.
---
I'll take things I could easily have googled for 200 Alex.
---
The initial comment was regarding killing a shadow priest with a full shield. If it were easy for all classes beside warriors then Spriest wouldn't be considered the top 1v1 class in the game
---
Depends on the class.  If you're healing or tanking, it's going to be harder than if you're just a dps, to the point that you may actually not be able to fill the role in your raid group anymore.  
---
You'll also be objectively disadvantaged in PVP against people using addons and macros well.
---
I personally don't mind minimal addons, but I don't like using complex macros for all my buttons.
---
What
---
And what exactly makes you think people won't use a gearscore app in classic?
---
i take it you haven't seen lion king yet then?
---
Totally agree - the recipes are very involved. Grinding your own meat and making fresh pasta on top of the meatballs and sauce makes for an all day affair. The meatball recipe from the book omits veal, opting for gelatin hydrated in buttermilk, which saves on cost a bit. Can't beat the umami from anchovies, marmite, and soy sauce though!
---
Alliance druid has it slightly better in my horde playing opinion. Kings and Judgement of Wisdom are better buffs for druids who don't get the benefit of Windfury. The former is more stats, the latter is decent mana. Fear ward, if you have a dwarf priest, is better than tremor totem for most of what people care about fears for. Plus the dresses look better on a night elf.
---
I played a shadow priest in vanilla, raided through AQ40. I loved it. I wouldn't expect a spot in a serious raiding guild (even if they take a spriest there's no reason to take more than one). If you're raiding then yes, mana is a constant concern. For solo, PvP and dungeons, it's not. You do need to itemize around MP5 as well as spell damage where you can. I think a lot of spriests don't gear correctly and run into mana issues.
---
Bear in mind that the spriest toolkit is more constrained in vanilla. I enjoyed it but in pve it is a much simpler class than hunter. In PvP spriests are awesome fun, especially when geared.
---
Well, your first mistake is your characterization of my statement. I said, and I quote verbatim, "Meanwhile, deep wounds and anger management are NOT trash, neither is improved rend". 
---
There is a bit of daylight between "good" and "not trash". I think you are a bit over your skis there in claiming I said the former when I actually said the latter. I wouldn't argue improved rend is amazing. 
---
I would say it's probably average while leveling 1-40, to slightly below average. It's much better than bad talents, like unbridled wrath, or improved battle shout, or improved heroic strike. It's worse than axe spec. It's MUCH worse than deep wounds. It's a lot better than literal do nothing talents like booming voice (for solo pve). 
---
But why is it "not trash", while improved battle shout is "minor"?
---
Because it's more than twice as good. Improved rend is just good enough to be a decent talent, because a 1% bonus dps talent (by your own math, which claimed 3% dps for 3 points) is actually quite reasonable. You get 1% from 2h weapon spec (an average talent), 1.1% plus a bit more rage from cruelty/axe spec (good talents). 2.5ish% from deep wounds (one of the best talents in the tree, and heavily dependent on actually having axe spec). 
---
It's just, when quantified, if you take an average at best talent and make it less than half as good, you end up with a bad talent. Or, as I put it, a "very minor" one.
---
I like gnome for escape artist in pvp situation
---
SF daggers won't be good until phase 2-3 where you will have the crit for it.
---
That 20% can and will happen multiple times in a row. Besides, what else are you going to spend that 1 point on that's more important?
---
I'm taking a week of vacation for it. I hope the servers hold up.
---
I recognize the council has made a decision, but seeing as it's a stupid ass decision I've decided to ignore it.
---
KLTM Threat Meter is gonna matter
---
Why would that be a better guild? I don't want the guild paying for people to respect who are expected to be in that spec for raiding.
---
The guild paying for respecs of people who choose to respec, is effectively taking money from people who choose NOT to respec. Why should that be happening? You're just saying it should be, and not saying *why*.
---
Any funds that would potentially be paid to people to respec, could instead be instead used for Flasks, or even paying out gold to EVERYONE in the guild who earned that gold, if there is a surplus. 
---
In a raiding guild, *the raids* are the concern of the guild, not everything else you decide to do with the rest of your time. 
---
So as a main tank, who will never be respeccing (I'll have an alt for farming materials/gold, etc.), I only see giving money to people to respec as a negative. Why should I want people getting paid to do things outside of raiding?
---
&gt;It's to accomodate for influx of tourists long term
---
Yes, which they will do by hugely overpopulating the servers to absorb the inevitable drop off and then using layering to prevent unplayable zone congestion...
---
one that works, and is comfortable.
---
Sharding will not exist in classic, you’re spreading misinformation with this thread.
---
&gt;Seems to perfect to be a coincidence.
---
Well ads showing on your cellphone are generated by what you watch so no it's totally normal.
---
Oh I did tell them I was only there for that, and I passed on everything else vendor greens and all. So you think someone who wants something solely through misinformation is a more legitimate claim than someone who is had given 25+ free carries in an effort for one trophy. Idk doesn't seem equal but I'll steal your socks too until it makes sense.

I can't answer for every variation of non-traditional industry pasta on the market, but in my 5 years working as a chef I have never had to boil any pasta more than 10 minutes, and usually less than 5.

Undead is better than troll whenever it's an option. Troll priest is viable, but still not better.

As a mage, troll is awful compared to undead.

Get an fps mouse like the glorious o so you can flick to specific raidframes like you'd flick to heads in an fps to maximize your healing and "snipe" others heals by being faster.  Mmo mice are for mongos

Joana's guide is the one and only you should follow, it will guarantee that you hit 60 during those 9 days.

yeah I was so incredibly disappointed with GW2. GW2 was going to be my new MMO and was hoping to play it for years. I still got a couple toons to max and dicked around for a little while, but yeah it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.
---
That's some impressive logic you have there, friend.
---
Losing the roll on priest quest item from MC. Had the Eye of Shadow or whatever it was in my inventory, linked it so I could roll and lost. Super bummed to this day. 
---
I did end up getting like 5/8 T1 in one MC run  Still have the Priest too.
---
Something along the lines of this...

So far this Corsair MM530 is doing great. Corsair M45, M65 were both great. Logitech G5=awesome. Logitech G303 Daedalus Apex =Awesome.
---
I sincerely hope it's less heartbeats for me. I've been trying to stay fit before release, so I can do with less sleep once we're live! ;)
---
The point remains the same.
---
They could just put on some devilsaur leggings and reduce their mitigation significantly and yet add important stats for threat generation
---
&gt;Minute 1 that's going to be a few hundred people.
---
That's sharding.  you really think they're gonna duplicate the world 1000 times over so each layer only holds a few hundred people?  we really need 1000 eastern plaguelands at launch?
---
My guild dismissed me after we missed realm first Heart of Fear because of a new tank accusing me of not knowing how to manage my threat on my DK. (Hint: I kept getting Aggro on his adds and mine during the final boss because he couldn’t pick them up)
---
Said new tank was a Paladin. I was already salty enough as it was about that too. This was, mind you, despite the fact that I could reliably survive by myself on a platform with Imperial Vizier for *minutes* without a healer on Heroic as a DK. It escalated after they found out I wasn’t stance dancing between Blood and Frost presence to *marginally* increase my DPS while I was OTing. At that point, I had only MT and didn’t feel comfortable stance dancing, plus this was when you would lose your RP. Losing my RP didn’t seem worth it. I was already playing a DK so we could 2 heal heroic fights. Why should I sacrifice more at this point when others can pick up their slack? In the end, it was a mutual step down from being in the group. 
---
I’m still good friends with my then GM and RL, but we both regret that time of our WoW careers very heavily because we let a new raider influence us with his now obvious toxicity and over the top elitist mind set. 
---
I decided it was time to take a break from WoW after that, and came back near the end of ToT, in to the beginning of SoO with my Paladin and had a lot of fun, for what it was at the time.
---
Hey Josey, if I could solely focus on ONE thing in World of Warcraft... it would be WPvP. Druids are the absolute BEST WPvpers if played correctly. I might make a video on this to explain more in depth why, but a couple reasons are: Ability to pick fights/ gank with stealth &amp; our mobility to get away if we need to :)
---
BG's, we are basically dedicated FC's in WSG for good reason, instant mobility. AB I've done everything from healing group fights to ninja capping to node defending. AV is kind of a big cluster, so just doing what you need to do to help the team win!
---
They are both Rare *Elite*, might be why? 
---
I think he only mentioned rares in the video, not rare elites.
---
They won't solve mob competition with sharding because it doesn't need solving. For the first few hours there will be 400 people in each starting zone trying to level, after that the population will naturally spread out in the world
---
If you want to go into the semantics of it I never claimed you said it was good, I was repeating PHO20s question.
---
Swifty’s “incredible warrior tricks”
---
Laintime high warlord pvp. Showcasing top-notch Korean skills nearly 15 years ago
---
I can't understand why people can't figure this out. This is essentially what they did for new servers in vanilla. They would initially have a small cap on population and as people spread out they increased the cap.
---
Humans get increased reputation bonus, very nice for the long rep grinds if that is your thing. NE get shadowmeld --&gt; mind control which can be a blast in WPvP and BGs.
---
&gt; The fact that it seems like essentially every hybrid has to heal in raids plummets that interest to actually 0.
---
It will not be hard to find people that let you play what you want and that won't bother if you are not in full pre-BiS for MC. It's just a pserver minmaxer thing. Everyone will be able to find a guild where most people think like them, GM included. Therefore if what you mentioned is your only problem with raids, just go ahead and expect to be raiding at least MC and BWL rather easily, which are already good for PvP.
---
&gt;  Is this a realistic strategy for hybrid classes or am I stuck having to main a pure DPS class? 
---
No. Just play hybrid if you want to play hybrid. You are just shooting yourself in the foot if you don't play what you want and plan to play in the long run. This game is easy, everyone was shit back in the day, and several suboptimal guild setups cleared many bosses in Naxx. Same for that consumable / engineering mandatory things. They are just vocal, but they won't constitute the majority of people you'll play with. Those guys will already have raid rosters prepared before Classic or at least way before you'll be level 60.
---
Also, don't forget PvP Bgs won't be in the game until phase 3. So you have a LOT of time to just farm whatever you want in MC and dungeons.
---
Dagger from redridge cave rare eilite mob is also blue BoE. And you missed more than one.
---
What is a timer on those rare?     
---
What about dungeon rares and their loot?
---
Nightfall is significantly more expensive to craft and comes out later.
---
Amazing episode, I have to be honest think Pantheon needs a new voice, listening to Brad was kind of painful and honestly made the game sound boring and really dampered my hype.
---
The emphasis on the over indulgent "matchmaking" system is absolutely bizarre. A good mmorpg does that on its own. 
---
It seems like they're masking a lot of retail wow quality of life add-ons that the community hates and calling them things like "caravans" and "match making", the world just keeps getting smaller.
---
Mentoring is always a weird choice as well, it just diminishes immersion.
---
This was the weirdest feeling for me, I thought I was pumped about this game and by the end I felt disconnected.
---
... Yes.
---
Do you actually think they're going to have 1000-1500 people loading into northshire abbey at the same time on every single layer? Like, wut? The stress tests didn't even get close to that many people in one area.
---
There's a reason they're called huntards
---
Also relaxing and savoring the pizza. I would never chow it down whole gaming, what a waste. but that's just me.
---
We used smoke signals, and emotes.
---
&gt;but with current knowledge most people who want to do damage are going to roll a pure class
---
But I don't want to just do damage. And I don't want to just heal, or just tank. I want to hybrid.
---
Nah he just browsed database for 5minutes and comed up with this short vid. Lul
---
I think you may have reading problems, buddy. You should go back to school.
---
Vegan undeads
---
Oh no. I'll respec after leveling (Spirit Tap is useless as a healer), and hypothetically if I'd rather be doing PvP I'd respec a second time to Shadow. I wouldn't be going back and forth lmao.
---
It's just kind of hard to make consistent use of an ability like that in PvP. It's underwhelming for the same reason that fast weapons are bad for PvP: you just don't get to stand there and machinegun spells or run a melee rotation. Also, since you have to be low on health to get proper value out of the racial, it has anti-synergy with itself in that the time when you're least likely to stand there pumping out DPS is when you're low on health.
---
So it's about as good as it can be. Still not good enough though. The longer a fight is, the more adventage regular stat stick weapons have. 
---
And farming for this is still an issue not addressed. Assuming you can get one every half an hour, (VERY generous) and all boss fights are the perfect length for this weapon (90 sec, which again is very generous), and you 1shot all bosses (very unlikely) you would farm 5 hours per MC run. That's more than the actual raid. That is, on top of your regular consumables which can also take 2 ish hours. 
---
And you did all this farming. You have an edge over stat stick weapons for boss fights (maybe 30%?). You have this perfect weapon. You still need a stat stick for trash, which makes up the majority of a raid, and the majority of your DPS. 
---
I would not class it as the bis weapon. Maybe it's bis for burst, but definitely not overall bis.
---
You didn’t include the fact in your original post that you told everyone up front that you wanted the staff. Obviously that is a completely different situation. No need to get defensive...
---
Once on a twink rogue i had i gave a enchanter all of the mats she needed for a bunch of enchants i wanted plus a nice tip. Unfortunately the enchanter took everything and walked away and refused to respond back. I reported the person unsure if she ever faced consequences i never received my stuff back.
---
Resilience was a very good change. If you were rolling in bgs with full Maxx gear at the end of vanilla, you'd understand. People were 2-shotting each other.
---
I don’t know much about the world of advertisement but why would they? It’s under the same subscription as retail. All they need to advertise is retail and if people wanna play they can. It’s where the vast majority are and will be. I’d be surprised if they even had a segment during blizzcon for classic wow because time is better spent on the future of WoW. They must not take it that seriously, hell they don’t even have a separate icon for classic on the launcher, it’s in the drop down tab. It honestly just feels like a fan service, that’s pretty cool and I’m thankful for it.
---
What are you smoking?
---
PVE is either SM+Ruin or DS+Ruin.
---
Ruin (crit makes a lot more damage) is mandatory for pve. 
---
SM+Ruin is a really strong specc in pvp also because you can  get things like instant corruption, nightfall,  siphon life and shadowburn.
---
&gt;Good thing developers aren't in charge of marketing.
---
You used the term "them" to mean all of Blizzard, not the marketing department. Blizzard the company, and specifically the Devs that put hours and hours of their time into making these games, don't care what game is or isn't successful as long as people enjoy their product. 
---
&gt; What does this even mean?
---
That you have an issue where you believe you, as a player, are a victim of "big bad Blizzard" who are just "out to get you".
---
Good job avoiding my other points that you know you have nothing for lmao.
---
It should be August 13th at midnight (the start of the 13th, not the end) Central European Standard Time (CEST). If you're in the Eastern US like me that will be 6pm EST August **12th**.
---
HOWEVER ... I don't believe that we have official confirmation of the timing. Just a bulletin that servers will be available on the 13th. The assumption we've made is that it will work like the actual game launch which will happen at midnight (CEST) on the 27th.
---
If I were so quick to defend morons, I probably would have just skimmed through your post and patted you on the back like most of the others.
---
Imo healing does not need a good mouse. You need a good addon such as Healbot
---
Dwarf in general is the best race on Alliance. Because of their racial "Find Treasure".
---
Do you have a source for this? That sharding will be active along with layering?
---
you ever seen Pirates of the Caribbean?
---
You dont remember spawn times from 14 years ago??? Filthy casual!
---
I second the Scimitar. I bought it exclusively for WoW Classic and I have been testing it out lately and acclimating myself to it and I now use it as my primary mouse. I have a different Corsair mouse for my shooters though. The Scimitar is a bit big/heavy for FPS gaming, otherwise I use it for everything else.
---
I would say it would probably not be ideal for someone with small hands. I can't speak for the razer naga as I don't own a single razer product.
---
no because a vanilla realm's size has always been estimated to be around 3k, and there's 6 starter zones to spread that out.
---
i dont give a fuck how its called i just hope they turn it up to max the first 12h.
---
gimme my own shard/layer where i can solo quest 1-10
---
Yes. This is the right answer. After being so hyped and eager for the game to release I'm actually pondering not getting it at all. I know I won't like myself when I get into my old gaming habits.
---
wait... i thought Sharding was x server and layering is only your own server split up. so with sharding you can meet people from other servers!?
---
To each their own! I hope you enjoy it though :)
---
Can confirm : currently sitting at work reading reddit since I already did 3 hours of work this morning. May or may not do another hour of work this afternoon.

5 piece t2 and regrowth spec and you won’t be the lowest hps in the raid anymore.
---
Yup. I even have a macro from back then just to make fun of people in trade spamming for groups with stupid requirements.
---
It's been obvious for a few years that they have no intention of building "WoW2". There's a reason they've put so much investment into constantly upgrading WoW's engine and updating graphics. The failure of every other "sequel MMO", their own failure with Titan, their fleeting success with Legion, their success with Overwatch. Everything is telling them not to make WoW2 or any other new traditional style MMO for that matter. It's just not going to happen.
---
You say you're inexperienced, but you've already made a better choice than half of the wow population. You'll do just fine.
---
And be revered with the faction that is connected to MC, if I remember correctly.
---
You're salty cus horde is the better faction or what?
---
i mean i wasn't arguing for no changes, just against F R E S H
---
Does mouseover work on minimap tracked entities?
---
&gt; Someone would have to assign every piece of gear an individual score for that
---
No you wouldn't. You'd just have to create stat weights and use that to calculate the total value of a player's gear.

"*However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful*"
---
Making this claim is like saying that Overwatch being successful invalidates WoW. They wouldn't have started the Classic project if they saw it as competing with retail. They've literally said that. They see it as something different enough to appeal to a different crowd. A way to get subs from people they otherwise wouldn't.
---
If it makes you feel any better, they’re not Mp5 they’re Hp5, and are horrible. The Talbar Mantle that you get from the quest line from that boss are much better
---
I think shaman have a talent build that is both a strong pve healer and a strong pvp elemental, so no need to respec.

5 hours of sleep is detrimental to your health. Study after study has shown regularly getting less than 7 hours of sleep greatly increases your risk of heart disease and cancer, two of the leading causes of deaths from medical complications

Well duh someone has to make sure ret pallies and boomkins aren't discriminated against.

Though if I ever lose my mind and try to run a guild that is probably the title ill give to the raid leader in charge of telling people with meme specs to go home.

no way. bunch of yucky freaks in mud huts and skelly boys in rotten sewers
---
All zones use sharding, some use cross-realm if they are very low pop otherwise. It doesn't matter for classic since classic will not have sharding, only layering.
---
The only difference are the respawn times.
---
They are continuously banning for it. Better not to use it.

You do realize Blizzard can make layers with any maximum size they want, right?

On a private server? Hit chances are known to be significantly higher than classic. A 6 level difference on classic would probably mean you’re struggling to generate threat at level 55.

Disney ruined Star Wars and Marvel and people still trust them to not do it with WoW? Unbelievable.
---
Depends on the play style...
---
It would be more practical for you to stick to pure pve holy and farm with a guildy warrior, split the loot but you'll be going more than twice as fast as either going solo.
---
Ya I started using it years ago. I can't even imagine not having it. With G shift you can bind soooo much stuff to it.
---
Yeah i originally had the items displayed for far too short but deleted it and touched it up. Outside of extending how long they are displayed its largely unchanged. And thank you.
---
I’m definitely toning down my addons from my last retail experience. No frames/bartender addons. No quest addon(unless I find one that just shows quest starts). I will be keeping an autoshot timer, enemy castbar, and hopefully a bag sort/sell junk addon.

If its an online game with a large population it revolves around Twitch. Guess what WoW Classic is? Its not a single player game like The Witcher or Zelda, its a multiplayer game that basically every big longtime streamer and youtuber started out with. There is going to be thousands of hours of classic content on both twitch and youtube when the dang thing releases, actually there is already thousands of hours of content. WoW is in the twitch-sphere just like every big multiplayer game.
---
Now that is a swimming trek!
---
And before that you had to kill some trash. IF you want to fight ragnaros the first raid, your first raid needs to be hella organized

You are correct. Check out the patch notes:

WotLK scourge invasion 2.0, so really not vanilla but. There was this shaman on Talnivarr EU named Zebrahead who took it upon himself to abolish the ghoul disease from everyone in sight.

Final Countdown on Frostmane. Hope my post isn't disparaging the guild, I loved that guild more than any other I was ever in. Learned a lot as a young teen from my mostly-older guildies

That quote is from long before layering was ever talked about.
---
In the same interview where they first talked about layering they also said sharding did not feel right for classic so they had developed the layering tech.
---
Apart from the thirteen bucks a month some of us are already paying anyway, there isn't much of a payment model implemented compared to retail. Given the revenue of retail and the expected lesser revenue of classic, I'd focus my attention on retail too, if I were blizzard.

Not saying it's the way to go; just saying I can understand the decision not to make a big deal of it.

21/30/0 is perfectly fine for what you want to do, as is 30/21/0. Take your pick. In private servers 21/30/0 was sweeter as it gave you /sit reckoning stacks for single target farming as well. But this won't be a thing on classic, so you might as well pick the extra critical heal chance.

Thanks again for your comments, I appreciate the insight. As I said I've now added tanks to the prio list and would be happy to see this go to a tank, but I would still choose to give Hunters first priority.

I think WoD could be a great expansion if only:

1) They didn't literally abandon it after release.

[Listen to this interview with Ion Hazzikostas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236) The important bit is at 5:24 where he says "unlike what we do with sharding...".

So much gold in this thread! Moaaar!

Never really had any grudges in wow, but my GM during vanilla could have become one had his plan worked out. He was just an awefull warrior, and he tried to reserve TF, ragna hammer and ashkandi for himself. He only told another officer about this and it was something of a secret until the halfs of TF started dropping. I was MT but missed the first raid that one binding dropped. Second drop is the same and I get it. Third drop is the one we need and I would have lost my shit if the rest of the guild hadnt backed me up and made sure I got it over the GM. I wouldnt mind passing it to someone more active or capable than me, but this guy just didnt learn. He kept yelling on ventrilo during nef-fight to warriors that they should keep their rends up... and on vael I didnt understand how he could be so far behind on threat. Turned out he never used HS as a tank. Ever.

The world isn't the US. My country's average wages are ~9x lower than in the US. Imagine spending 135$ a month? That's why literally nobody I know IRL will play.

Fucking thought so.

I just got one on amazon for $30!

They can also ride wolves, provided they do the requisite Org rep grind to exalted.
---
You're forgetting that the profits of labor have gone up while wages haven't, so we could have both: the luxurious lifestyles we enjoy now and the 4 day work week (or even less) if greedy capitalists paid fair wages.

Exactly.  We're talking about why there aren't any cable TV advertisements and I haven't had cable TV in around 9 years.

My mom died at 47 from a heart attack due to poor health. She wasn't fat or have health problems prior but she ate poorly, drank too much and stayed up late. She never got to meet my son. Your death doesnt effect only you, it hits everyone in your life and your kids life if you have them. My grandpa helped raised me and is still alive today. He got to meet his great grandson while my mom didnt even get to see me graduate high school. 
---
I cant change what you do random internet stranger but I do encourage you to think beyond yourself and to your family and friends.
---
I leveled a priest from 1-60 on a pserver so Yes, your build looks good. I went different leveling though and basically I got 5/5 wand spec THEN started up the shadow tree until shadowform then I went back to the disc tree. 
---
You can heal leveling dungeons TOTALLY fine as shadow spec as long as you are a decent player you won't have any problems. That being said you could justify going more holy or disc if you are mainly going to be leveling in a group.
---
As for your endgame build its pretty unique I'll say that. It depends on what your going to do. That build should be pretty versatile for pvp. As for healing dungeons, you can heal as probably any spec at the 60 dungeons. Being this spec you won't have a good heals as a holy or disc priest but you can always make up for that with the gear you have.
---
Maybe you could try something like this spec:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50022213002-20305-0502322102511](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/50022213002-20305-0502322102511) 
---
Holy nova isn't really a great pvp ability OTHER than to get stealthies out of stealth with rank 1. It's max rank is 750 mana and just not worth it unless you are for sure healing 5 low people with it, which will rarely happen in pvp. And for dungeons holy nova isn't great, you still have prayer of healing if you absolutely need to aoe heal. This spec will give you a bit more pressure as shadow, totally up to you though
---
You’re correct. I’m thinking of the eternal quintessence.
---
Oh cool, I forgot about the hearthstone thing.
---
What are you talking about lol.  They can cover about 90% of their target audience through Twitch streamers and the resultant redistributed content.
---
I never turn on twitch, but I see recaps of videos posted on YouTube and reddit.  Through those 3 means, they literally cover at LEAST 90% of the audience.
---
They are including classic in the base sub. They want to encourage people to go back and forth between classic and retail and even though they haven't said it they'll probably stagger content releases between the 2 games. Retail content drought? Have a classic patch! Retail expansion coming out? Let classic sit for a bit so they get bored of it. They want you to play both games. 
---
Wow in general is 10+ years old. Retail and classic. The only difference is that retail has been getting updates and up until now if you wanted vanilla you had to play on private servers. Tbh I'm just happy we dont have to pay $60 plus sub fee to play like we do with bfa.
---
95% of Horde guilds match these. Check a LFM Monday thread.
---
I've definitely been contemplating it, thanks for the video

If this sounds like something you might be interested in I am happy to answer any questions you might have.
---
How else will I get xXxlegolasxXx?
---
I've seen all interviews.
---
He literally elaborated on "sustaining healthy communities in the long run" before talking about layering, which further reinforces my point.
---
They never said Sharding was scrapped, all they did was come out of no where and say they'll implement layering to accommodate for influx of players and tackle the tourist issue. Sharding is for starting zone mob congestion.
---
Explain to me where I've said I'm trusting everything they do and say, while I'm living in a fantasy world where Blizzard is a god.
---
All you've done is talking bullshit, well played! :) And nice lie, subtle and cute.
---
Sometimes I wonder how these people made it to the age where they have a phone and can post comments on reddit without falling down a manhole or walking off a cliff.
---
Interesting. Any chance you have more info?
---
No gymnastics needed. You seem to leave out all other information mentioned in every response and you don't seem to have a basic grasp of economics or financial decision making? What is the cost benefit of trying to get 100% of people who may be interested in playing the game to play? Of all these people how many do you think don't know about it already? 20%, 50%? How many millions will need to be spent globally to capture these missing people you think so highly of and will the incremental revenue gain offset the cost associated to achieve it?
---
The target audience are fans like yourself so again, personally I see no point in spending the money for marketing.
---
How much money does Blizz spend on current WoW marketing in between new expansions? Not much I would say. So why do you think they will spend more on something that isn't even supposed to be a remastered game (no changes!).
---
I think you need to start thinking with a logical mind instead of and fanatics one.
---
GL.  Of all the the non-meta specs feral is the most viable so it should be okay.  
---
Just so you know, you do not have need a feral tank for any fight in AQ40, it just cant be 2 warriors alone.  I think a warlock tanks are the default strat.  
---
Often ferals do make great off-tanks for trash or adds that are killed first as they have better aggro then warriors, and can get away with wearing mostly dps gear while tanking so after their add is dead they can go onto doing damage.  For flag running, feral does very good, but resto/hybrid specs are better since the self healing from NS gives them more survival and when you find yourself without the flag resto is more useful in group fights.  
---
I feel like feral has a slight advantage as alliance getting kings, freedom, etc as a flag carrier, and resto is slightly better as horde as there is no shaman so less dispelling of your hots as resto.
---
Does gnome intellect racial really have any noticeable effect in PvE or PVP?
---
You misinterpret. I'm saying at whatever point OP hits 60 (assuming they are an average player), they will at most be an item or two behind, because you're only going to get an item or two every month.
---
You are way off the mark.
---
Yeh razor mouse is great. I got the deathadder and I healed all my life with it.

---
14 buttons all within click reach
---
They could fix some of that just by e.g. adding some new dungeons with drops that that fill in the itemization gaps. (i.e. without really changing the class abilities)
---
There is some truth to this even tanking in pve.
---
I still salty about the existence of Rogues.
---
2 points in imp inner fire is probably around 300 armor so you'll have to figure out how worth that is. Probably great for physical damage classes. 
---
Yes, I might have a fetish for all 5/5 shadoweaving so you have a point there. 
---
You will just have to play with it and figure out what works best, I never tried a spec like this myself.
---
As for leveling solo the reason I went 5/5 wands then all the way up the shadow tree is that you pretty much never use anything else when solo leveling.
---
Solo leveling looks like this.
---
1. Bubble self (you can renew instead if your not at max health)
---
2. Mind blast target
---
3. Shadow word pain target
---
4. Wand it until its dead
---
5. Optional to mind blast again in between wanding for more dps at the cost of more mana
---
Stories like these are why I'm going PvP server, despite my terrible self confidence and basic inability to pvp.
---
Thanks dude, on the way.
---
unfortunately no. I haven't played classic and I'm sure it's different than it is on pservers.
---
You realize that we’re their marketing strategy, right? We’re doing the work for them without them paying a dime lol
---
Ok i got your points guys.
---
Sorry i wasn’t very clear about what I called Hotw spec and seemed to confuse some of you guys. I’m talking about a 30/21 build.
---
So in this thread there is two separate ways. Some of you told me yeah it’s totally viable go for it and some of you say don’t play this même même spec, you won’t be able to tank !
---
I’m a bit confused I admit. I know 30/21 is totally not optimal for Off tank at all but I don’t want to because I will be wpving a lot too and this spec is what I want to play. 
---
But when I plan to off tank I plan be the most optimized as I can get. Like Mcp. Trinket armor and so one... 
---
So with that in mind, are you sure I won’t be able to off tank at all and my dream is fucked ? Is that your trying to tell me ? :’(

Once upon a time, Disney was a company that was passionate about telling stories through movies. Now it is a corporation specialized in selling entertainment , movies are a by product, they just need IPs to make merchandising.
---
Disney is like Activision. It would be even the worst for blizzard. Look at starwars, how they milk the franchise in every possible way, it's becoming absurd.
---
Yes I do realize that and even commented on it being sad we are doing their job for free.
---
Well Shammys have disappointment already built in :)
---
Tyvm!
---
single decent resto talent (Gift of Nature)
---
Moonglow, Nature grace. Try again.
---
Dude. Consumables for raids are the exact opposite of respeccing for non-raid content. The EXACT fucking opposite. So yeah things that help RAIDS, absolutely. Paying for respecs so people can do NON-RAID activities... hell no.
---
I'll make it really simple for you.
---
If money *can be potentially* paid out for respecs, them we're pre-supposing there is excess money there. So that's a fact. There's extra money in the bank. So if there's extra money in the bank, and it's not needed for guild-related activities, then extra money *earned by the guild as a whole* COULD be played out equally to all members. Instead of paying it out weekly who CHOOSE to do things outside of raid. And things outside of raid is none of the guild's business.
---
What are you talking about "feelings"? I'm making an argument. And that is that it has nothing to do with THE RAID what someone does outside of raid, and if they want to respec to pvp or farm resources/gold or whatever. 
---
So yeah, I'd rather everyone in the guild get excess gold, rather than the ones who choose to respec. You don't have to respec. You HAVE TO do your job in the raid. That's what you were brought on to do. So it's not the guild's business, or problem, what you do outside of raiding. So the guild SHOULDN'T BE PAYING FOR IT.
---
Oh gotcha — didn’t see it. I mean I don’t know if it’s sad, it just shows how much hype potential this game has
---
No med pet in vanilla isn't instant hot.
---
Well idk? You think they would ever do an R rated warcraft movie with gore/fighting in the style of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan? Although it would be cool, i think any company would view Warcraft for kids, and teens (even though i think the true audience is 20+). They would wanna make all the money, which would mean making a movie for all ages knowing the older generations will see it anyways cause they’re fans.
---
Gimme a hint, what does the first letter start with?
---
MoP was when I knew i made the right decision to bail out of Cataclysm.  Kung-Fu pandas from fucking Pandaland?  Really?!?!  This was WoW's most ridiculous expansion borne from a childish concept.  The lost about 2.3 million subscribers during those laughable years...which wasn't a big surprise.
---
If your #1 concern is wpvp, you will likely be specced prep hemo or prep daggers, so you already have 2 built in snare breaks.  To me that means dwarf is the way to go, so that you can combo them against enemy warriors or rogues to get full resets.  
---
Gnome I think is better for non-prep specs where you are more likely needing that extra snare break for things like nova and can't rely on having vanish up as often.
---
where is the book where the horde and alliance start buttfucking and live happily ever after under a rainbow.  They ruined this lore so badly.
---
It is a bit because they know it works and we don't get anything for it I would love to see a teaser for classic beyond what was done at Blizzcon years ago.
---
ok dude im not going to be mean etc
---
you are making a video pls do your research 1st
---
your pre bis sure it is a prebis - you dont mention some of the important stuff on the bosses that drop them like rare spawns or a summon event
---
your raid bis is absolute garbage and if i see druid wearing those i will know he is a trash druid - unless its a flag runner since some of the choices are absolutely great as flag runner
---
Run up in that bitch as the Hulk!
---
If by 'beefy' you mean having a lot of hit points, that is completely based on gear. As far as 1v1s go,they will 90% of the time be completely unbalanced in the open world, although classes like druid and paladin can very easily just run and self-heal.
---
Thankfully those of us rolling on PvE servers don't have to worry about streamers and their army of neckbeards swarming around.
---
Play a healer or a hunter, you removed half the classes so it is literally the only options left.
---
I’m all about the professor plums
---
I like the way you think.
---
When your a NE priest stealth camping Black Rock Mountain.  Just waiting for unsuspecting victims to mind control into the lava.
---
How's that? Not challenging, just asking. I know you can FAP the dragonkin stuns in BWL etc. Stuff like that?
---
With his spec? Inner focus.
---
&gt;Most of the "aoe threat" your going to do consists of the high white damage with either a 2 hander + windfury or DW. 
---
Hmmm....
---
I specifically said "in my opinion" right after saying that to circumvent sounding dismissive of others choices. I get your point about some people spending more time than others leveling, but i think youre overreacting a little bit man.
---
I played a troll priest at vanilla launch and pvpd a bunch as a healer. There is a reason people took to wotf, not only to be able to cast it but the 5 sec immunity. Think about this versus a warlock with succubus where I could pop a trinket once to remove the 10 charms and chain fears.  When people started rolling around in T2 / T3 PVP became nuclear warfare and every second counted. Armor, spell warding talents, timing, and positioning mattered more than the differences between UD and troll. It was nice to duel shit talking UD priests in 1v1 though, it is always stacked in trolls favor. Hex, beserk mana burning, shadowguard.
---
holy shit, a bolognese with chicken. the blasphemy
---
Food time is not mutually exclusive with video game time
---
I usually do both at once
---
Even for a family, 2 hours a day is excessive unless you're making every meal from scratch or something.  We do a lot of chicken, rice, and veggies.  I can get chicken baking in the oven, rice and veggies on the stove, and go sit down for 30 minutes grinding WoW while that shit cooks.
---
Tacos are another go to for my wife and I, easy to make a lot of food and kids never complain about tacos.  Again, maybe 10 minutes actually standing in front of the stove browning the meat and chopping veggies, another 15-20 letting everything cook while you grind.
---
I used to think cooking good food at home took a long time, until my wife told me I was retarded and showed me why I was wrong.  Now I don't mind cooking for the family at all if she's busy (usually she has dinner ready by the time I get home from work) or its the weekend and its my turn to be primary chef.
---
For me it has to be Duskwood and Tanaris, the whole spooky feel to duskwood made it for me, I was always taking screenshots for my wallpaper. And the music in tanaris wandering the open desert was a memorable experince.
---
... Loktar Ogar?
---
Nyet, only kodos and wolves, and the latter only after a patch made them available somewhere down the line. I don't begin to remember which one, though.
---
That all makes a lot of sense hopefully by the time i hit 60 i'll have a better idea if this build is stupid/smart and whether 300 armor matters haha. The idea behind it in my head is just survivability is king in PvP. So i'll be going for as much stamina as possible while picking up a bit of int/spell power. Same thing on the tree, far enough up into holy  for divine fury/1 value point in nova, far enough into shadow for silence, and then just more survivability/utility in disc.
---
Yeah. An absolute asshole move. I wasn’t even really switched on enough at the time to realise that a comment like that could cause offence. Never did get the second claw either 🤦‍♂️
---
Is disney worse than activision ?
---
Its a lot easier to get exalted with Ironforge or Stormwind than it is Darnassus.
---
Darnassus requires leveling in Teldrasil by like lvl 4 and continuing to level through all the NE faction quests, which are  faw away from where most alliance quest.
---
I don’t think they need to buy Blizzard, but working together could be kinda cool
---
Blizzard helps Disney make games, and Disney helps Blizzard making feature films based on their IPs. I bet overwatch could be made into a successful  movie or series, if Disney helped with it
---
Switch to horde and join up bruv
---
Un'goro was always a fun place.
---
HotW is the only spec that can literally be viable in every role but raid DPS.
---
I was thinking ablout BluePlz and EPIC! the other day
---
I can still remember grinding out bugs at lvl 58 on my warlock while enjoying TBs content.
---
I hate that he wont see the launch for classic, I can only imagine he would have enjoyed the 2nd renaissance.
---
When TBC prepatch came out, we did ZG and the tiger mount dropped. Raid leader decided to keep it for himself. Never saw him on server again.
---
And you can run away easily when you inevitably fail to finish them.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAboZbZVMGdMuo 
---
This is similar to what you did, it is the spec I used when pvp grinding for rank 12.  We had some good resto shamans, so I often found myself only needing to spot heal and usuing my kit to try and help be an anti-healer with mana burning and silencing enemy healers when kill opurtunities present itself.  I really don't think the cast time talent in holy is worth it for gheal in pvp, you are unlikely to be wearing enough +healing for the mana effeciency to be great, and you are unlikely to be wearing enough +damage for smite to be worth exposing your holy tree to counterspells.  Just mindblast/flay/burn for damage and fish for blackouts and heal with fast flash of lights.  This spec/playstyle works for all the races, but best on troll adding in hex to further frustrate enemy healers.  
---
I used 3 piece Tier 1 for the 0.1sec off flash healing and 3 piece T2 for the extra regen, then when I got rank the 2 pieces of that for the stam bonus.  
---
For leveling almost anything with spirit tap is fine as priest.  Shadowform is faster for leveling, but I always hated it so I can understand if you do as well.  Smite just isn't much better then wanding, so the holy points don't help much while solo.  I think the mid disc talents are better since the mana helps in both leveling as well as healing 5mans.
---
I think for the guilds that go crazy with stuff, they do it because they find it fun. Everyone knows you don't really need an *Advisory Light Leather Scrap Officer*, but it's ran by people in lower management that have wet dreams about creating complicated ERP spreadsheets and going to teambuilding/leadership conferences and play to live out their corporate fantasies.   
---
For people that just want to play the game yeah they just do what's actually required, so typically a head honcho and a couple of bros that are somewhat reliable and smart for when head honcho is off.
---
Paying someone to jump off the world tree.
---
go lock. In pve its 1 button, bind it to a mousebutton or mousewheel also.
---
In pvp, dot fear drain and watch them die. No need to press even the move keys if the opponent is garbage. 
---
Avoid warrior, rogue, druids.
---
Mage is also a great option for pve, in pvp you need to do lots of stuff.
---
It will rarely happen multiple times consecutively and I can't imagine it a deciding factor even if it does. I'd listen to any hypothetical scenario or maths eagerly
---
Depends on so many things over PvP class spec but here are some core “types” of macros to get you started 
---
/targetplayer 
---
/castsequence
---
/targetlasttarget
---
#showtooltip
---
And of course my favorite of all time 
---
/use Tainted Core
---
/run f=SendChatMessage w="WHISPER"c="Tainted Core"t="target"u=UnitName(t)if IsItemInRange(c,t)==1 then f("You have the "..c,w,nil,u)f(u.." has "..c,"RAID")else f("Can't throw core at you. Get close!",w,nil,u)Minimap:PingLocation(0,0)end
---
OG Stranglethorn Vale. Everything about it, from Nesingwary to Gurubashi Arena to the constant world PvP.
---
Inner focus
---
You fail to see the fourth option of doing nothing.
---
I think faith in blizzard should be shakey at best with past performances for games. Releasing 3 less than stellar expansions in a row. Legion is only touted as good because it was bread and water after being fed the shit of wod. WoD, Legion and BfA are all below the quality of what they used to release.
---
 I understand you have high hopes for classic but my understanding is classic is a "small" team and as such can interact with the community. 
---
Just because jobs are "on the line" means nothing. They cut 100's of people in the name of profit what is 20 people that no longer have a use? As they say "Nothing personal, It's just business"
---
You also talk about monetized addons for possible future content. Its bad enough with the payment model of retail it does not need to be repeated with a "new timeline". 
---
I'm happy people are looking forward to classic. Giving people a way to play a Blizzard endorsed vanilla game client. I just am not deluding myself into thinking the game will be as fun as it was 14 years ago when people had not been playing it for 14 years. It may be something I engage in but not in a serious way.
---
The GM's wife in my first guild was handed the first Eye of Divinity with no discussion even though she was trash. I blew her out of the water in healing every week even though she had better gear. Didn't get mine until like a month later. I can still hear the GM's dumb midwest hick voice trying to justify it.

This is exactly what happened. I saw it in some docu I was watching about this the other day. Speculation is Mike announced his retirement then immediately wanted to make sure the company was on the right track before he left. He was grooming Brack to replace him, and in this he made Brack go out and do what he did... the Vanilla Ice Cream bit at Blizzcon.
---
Mike knows, make could see the loss in direction. He didn't want his company completely a shadow of itself and tried to repair its legacy before he left. Have a little faith in Brack.
---
Outland my friend, draenor is in a different dimension
---
I know it sounds cheesy but just give me a friendly and helpful community. I miss the days of people helping each other and just being social. Help people out then 5-10 levels later you run into that same person that helped you a few days ago.
---
Then don't work so much, or are those capitalist fat cats forcing you at gunpoint to do so?
---
And which of these are worth the most?
---
Throw thorium grenades then. Also, you're going to use them on nef and visc regardless of class.
---
Who was that bear that sat on the mailbox all day in Crossroads and told stories?
---
Day of the dragon would be such a cool movie. Especially animated in that hyper-realistic style. Pretty self-contained story, decent characters etc.
---
Did many weeks of progression with my guild through MC, including so many hours of prep work (mats, dung runs for gear, etc).  DKP system, got occasional bumps for 1st clears but mostly we just struggled to maintain farm status on a bunch of the earlier bosses, so we never cleared deep in.  GM brings a new hunter into the guild, and his first raid was during a week I wasn't able to make it.  Guild managed to down two new bosses, decided to reward everyone with big DKP bonus for attendance, and this guy magically has like twice my DKP.  The next week, one of the hunter pieces I'd been hunting drops, and it would've been a set bonus, but this guy has more DKP so he snags it.  Then some more shit drops.  Other hunters pick it up.  End of the raid I'd gotten zero loot and STILL had lower DKP than everyone else, all because I missed one week.
---
To this day, I still hate DKP (or, really, messing with DKP in an unscripted manner).
---
&gt; But those points also help you heal better, and you can still use shadow word pain and the like   
---
Many of them don't. Divine Fury, Searing Light, and arguably Holy Reach don't. Plus the game is balanced around off-spec pre-60. The only thing being on-spec means is you don't need to drink as often in instances.    
---
Plus this is a large goal-post shift from "smite spec is just as good." If healing makes up the difference, then it isn't "just as good" it is a compromise.   
---
&gt; The bubble is your push back prevention   
---
Bubble is expensive/inefficient/takes you out of the 5SR. It is a great emergency tool, but if you feel the need to use it every time Weakened Soul leaves, you're likely casting it too much.
---
Absolute hero persona. I'm glad I wasn't the only one. I referred to myself in the third person on the forums, called myself "Prizefighter, the Almighty", and was a really prominent shit posting idiot in my server community. I really do miss those days.
---
Same.  11 yrs until I was medically separated.
---
Sorry for making assumptions, but your entire post SCREAMED military.
---
Eh, you get harassed if you have the audacity to roll a female character anyway, so I always got the creepy cyber-sex whispers. The problem is they become a lot more persistent when they know there's an actual girl on the other side of the keyboard.
---
But honestly the thing that annoyed me most is everyone on the server suddenly acted like they knew me personally, people in the top raid guilds of the server, the PvP premade crowd. Everyone in the high society of the server had suddenly adopted me as some kind of mascot.
---
It was pretty demeaning, it even followed me to Horde side. I rolled up a shaman and when I told someone I came from Alliance and my character name they were like "Ooooh &lt;Bro's&gt; sister?"
---
I'm referring to "anyone that's already going to play it knows about it".
---
I just as easily could have NOT seen a comment or whatever and not know anything about it. I'm sure there's plenty of peeps like that.
---
Shit man, running LBRS a few weeks ago on a private server with my rogue buddy. Assassination blade drops and the fucking hunter rolls need. God damn melee weapon.
---
Absolutely hate hunters. Useless class that contribute very little to the group.
---
It is true that you can LAP every time a rogue opens on you, but if he isnt retarded he just kills your totem blinds you, and restarts.  This time you are on potion CD and he if skilled/geared enough and willing to pop consumes(mostly tea) at the same rate you are can basically 100-0 you in a stunlock.  
---
Obviously other players can LAP your warstomps and kick you mid cast as well.  
---
Everything has some level of counterplay, but orc is amazing because there is nothing the other guy can do about it other then not stun you in the first place which is a gigantic win for you.
---
Meh. This is one player giving some advice to everyone else, and we choose whether or not to abide by it. Don't let that aggravate you. 
---
And to OP: Great video with a remarkable S/N ratio. I hope you make more if you find equally interesting subjects to touch on.
---
I’m thinking of running NE priest cause I think shadowmeld will be a fun ability to have, dwarf priest is a ridiculous concept don’t get me started, fear ward or not. Just curious if anyone has any experience using starshards and how well it works for dps compared to SW:P or mind flay. Everything I have read says starshard is the most mana efficient dps a priest can use but I am wondering how it feels using it? If it doesn’t work as well in practice as theory
---
&gt; the other 1000 will be waiting in queue
---
The average person would be on a different server, since they would launch with 3x as many servers if they didn't do layering.
---
&gt; in ALL scenarios above you're still competing with a lot of people with or without layering
---
Yes, this is working as intended.
---
&gt; and that's why sharding will be implemented in the starting zones.
---
It won't though?  You keep saying this, but it's just not true.  Competing against a lot of people is exactly what most classic players want, and is the accurate vanilla experience Blizzard has promised us.  Just because you're mad doesn't really change reality lol
---
That's not how you quote on reddit.. or anything really.
---

I would need to play around with regrowth spec a bit more to  give you an accurate answer. Regrowth spec requires good enough gear + consumables to support the mana cost/ efficiency. The issue with regrowth is that it can tend to overheal a lot especially the HoT afterword. 
---
Using different ranks of healing touch is going to be your bread and butter. Other than having max rank on your bar for mongo NS heals etc. I recommend atleast having R3 and R4 healing touch. Iirc, I used R4 more so for 5-man dungeon healing, and R3 for raid healing.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely not advocating for roles without real value. You can do this with just two or three leaders. I'm only saying that creating clarity makes things run smoothly. When head honcho is off, no one asks who does what, because it was already laid out.
---
ok so if i was going to make a vid on how to gear the druid
---
i would start with gear to look for while lvling
---
examples of that would be
---
neck from princess in maradon - which is only lacking mp5 compared to prebis neck
---
spirit of aqua - +20 healing offhand from a quest
---
for weapon i would encourage healers to run some extra cathedrals to get +16 mace since its super good until your brd mace
---
i would mention how u will most likely run hotw for your 1st raid unless its not a rush and u are getting full prebis 1st and how a high int items are a great choice when funds are low and there is no dm to farm that extra gold - so getting magister belt+wrist is a great option giving your tons of int for extra ht4 spam even if they dont give you any +healing
---
i would mention that there are multiple options for things like pants boots even if they arent full pre bis its ok to raid with living legs if you have bad rng on brd drops or some caster always wants the legs in lbrs
---
same with trinkets - healers have 3 choices for trinkets in prebis(and for a while after that as well lol) 2 brd trinkets and ubrs trinket
---
with rings i would mention that even tho rosewine is prebis(and literally will only be replaced by caturizing or nef ring) running a seal+brd princess quest ring is totally fine as well
---
and of course the cape because healers get super excited for anything that has useful stats on cape - just relax u will have an option for healing cape in dm or heart of the wild(this is a forever cape so its super worth the investment)
---
belts are almost identical - thats why im a big fan of mage boe belt early on - wasting 600+ gold onmercy is something i would think twice about - just chill with boe belt that gives a dickload of int and get dm once its out - after that the guild you raid with will hook you up with corehound(which is again a forever type of item)
---
I planned to sub up for the name reservations, but I won free WoW time that will cover it. Had whatever the blizz cash is called waiting for that date, but I dumped it into sub time so I won't have to worry about it for a bit. At least I can post on the forums now to bitch about needing RP-PvP.
---
Anytime brother, hope you enjoyed it :)
---
So I guess more like the Diablo 2 transition to Diablo 3
---
Wow you're actually quite the dumbass aren't you?
---
You're basically reinforcing my point and you don't even realize it.
---
You're saying "you will still compete with a lot of people even with layering. Therefore saying 'you won't compete with a lot of people that's why we need layering' is false."
---
^ This is exactly what I said in this thread lmao.
---
The first time you realized you could mount in ZF
---
Not all hunters are terrible.  Last night on a Pserver, I joined a PuG for Deadmines as a Mage and the group leader was a Hunter.  He was *fantastic* both in his Hunter play and in marking the enemies (who to kill, who to ignore, whot to sheep, where Cookie and the Captain were etc).  Not all Hunters are Huntards.
---
You sir, need to be chairman of the Druid council.
---
Dilly Dilly!
---
What you describe is exactly 100% what I have which sucks a lot. Learned to deal with it and have been for nearly 10 years now. It peaked at about 5 years in and currently it’s quite alright but playing wow will probably aggravate it a lot unfortunately. Also scrolling on the mouse feels terrible and I try to use page up/down for that mostly.
---
Something which helped me immensely was making sure I was sleeping with my arms straight down instead of up or under my head. Made the tingling and soreness a lot milder.
---
Tried stretching and other exercises but it only made it worse for me, might be different for you though.
---
Let me know if you find something that helps, would be greatly interested!
---
one other benefit to engineering (that I haven't seen mentioned so far) is goblin jumper cables.
---
Being able to feign death to lose aggro, and then use your jumper cables to rez a healer can save what would otherwise be a wipe.  Doesn't happen often but when it does you feel like a hero.
---
It's so much easier in classic without every heal being smart
---
Soylent eliminates the need for that block of food in the schedule.
---
one guy said a thing over 3 weeks ago. the original article was from July 2. this is total trash clickbait.
---
The logic that something "doesn't matter" until a certain point doesn't really work. A character with engineering is objectively stronger than one without it, so having it is pure upside.
---
Interesting.
---
So the 25% stun res offsets 5% HP, stomp, and nat res?
---
Im assuming tauren is still better for pve
---
Ill probably start one with all my buddies and level when they're on.. but I'll have a few alts that I level on my own time
---
You refuted? How can you refute what I've never heard of. Which is true, regardless of what you think. 
---
It pretty much is stealing from the guild bank to give it to *some* members to do non-raid activities. How is it not? If the guild is cool with it, hey, all good. But I was just saying I wouldn't be cool with it, and why.
---
If you're giving money to respec or...whatever, then just give it to everyone, imo. Selecting certain people to hand out gold to, is wrong, imo. And I would not be a part of such a guild.
---
Frost mage or Fire mage? I will be raiding and PvPing.
---
Yes obviously not all hunters are terrible.  But hunters not only have the issue of rolling on everything, but then on top of that there are tons of instance wipes because their pets aggro accidentally.  I'd rather just bring a rogue along than risk a hunter going full huntard on the group.
---
I remember going to "outlands dev area?" in uninstanced deadmines before wall walking was patched. BOY WAS THAT SO COOL. Exploiting was probably one of my favorite things to do in vanilla. First time i went to GM island there was a lvl1 troll afk there flagged. I killed him, logged off and deleted my character(also lvl1) lmao.
---
I'm getting my facts from my rank 7 Spriest on Lightshope server with anathema/benediction and over 50000 honor kills.
---
Wanna come see him later tonight?
---
Wbu?
---
Like said in the video, you are competing with your own faction in farming honor. Honestly since a large portion of classic player base will be adults coming back, I don't think the grind will be nearly as bad as it was back then were the playerbase were around highschool where being able to play 12h daily is fairly easy.
---
Uh... probably just 1 and not rush.
---
Only rush I feel is necessary is the first day - and that's just to try and not have over population in my layer.
---
I'm not interested in burning out and texting to hit 60 in the first week.
---
It will probably take me 10 days or so but I rather focus on my main first.
---
Since it's my main, and having 4 level 30's doesn't help me get my epic riding.
---
Guys, I don't know what to play. I'm used to playing hunter but I really want to switch it up this time. I mainly want to play PvP but also PvE a bit.
---
I will not be playing hardcore (but still quite a bit) and will be aiming at rank 10 - 13 in PvP. 
---
Now the question is; playing solo (or as a duo), is playing a warrior worth it? Will I be useful as a pre-raid BiS (pvp Gear wise) from 5-mans or will my damage suck ass too much?
---
I'm trying to make a decision between these classes, with my duo buddy being a rogue:
---
-Warrior (tanking to get BiS pre-honor gear)
---
-Hunter 
---
-Feral/resto druid (on the fence about this one because they seem useless in BG except for WSG and maybe AV)
---
HALP!
---
We always did this on chromaggus
---
Gotta say that's a very bad way of playing. The amount of time you spend being self sufficient when just focusing on making money would get most of what you need from the AH much faster.
---
Besides whats the point in working so hard to get Enchanting maxed out and never play that alt enough to get the valuable recipes?
---
I plan to take a more focused approach and ask myself what my goal with this character. What will it take to get there, and what am I trading off to do it.
---
Heal is the lower level version of Gheal, they just change the name at some point while you are leveling.  When people get a lot of +healing gear they will start to downrank gheal because it heals for so much that it overheals.  Also, you get the benefit of your +healing gear(mostly) on lower ranks of spells, this makes those lower rank heals have very good healing per mana spent.  
---
In pve you ideally never get hit, so people gear full set of regen and +healing gear, so you are able to downrank gheal for hyper effecient healing and not run out of mana.
---
In pvp you are always going to get hit, and are likely the enemy teams #1 focus.  You have to wear high stam gear, and frequently you will not be able to use slow cast heals as some nearby melee is waiting to kick that slow cast.  Also in pvp far more of your mana is spent on utility abilities like PWS, dispel, fear, and dispelling some more.  As a result this further devalues +healing so that you as a priest basically prioritize stam and int as your most important stats, and +healing and regen just being a nice bonus when you can find some without losing a lot of stam.  
---
With that sort of gear, downranking in pvp is no longer much of a HPM gain, so taking the talent becomes near worthless.  It does allow you to smite for damage, but with points in imp mana burn and blackout I would suggest you should always do something else before smiting.  
---
+damage is a nice stat in pvp as you will be doing some damage, and it does generally benefit your healing, but it isn't that good because a lot of your most impactful abilities do not scale(silence, dispel, and mana burn) +damage only scales your pain and mind blast for damage.  
---
SO pvp mp5&gt;stam&gt;int&gt;healing=damage&gt;spirit
---
pve mp5&gt;healing=damage&gt;int=spirit&gt;stam
---
mp5 is ranked first, it is always very good, but it is expensive on gear itemization.  
---
Spirit changes a lot of value depending on spec and what tier.  Deep holy makes spirit better, as does the 3 piece for T2 gear.
---
You can easily watch PvP videos of shadow priests that have a much higher rank than you. You'll see them get chunked whenever someone geared crits them. Turns out a 1k bubble starts off strong but as people as people gear up it loses some of its initial power. Not saying PW:S isn't strong, but it's not going to make you forever tanky.
---
Don't know why you're trying to flex about being rank 7. You're just exaggerating what a Spriest does. You currently playing one doesn't change that.
---
Guild leader in my first guild forbid us from participating in wPvP because of some code of ethics he said we needed to have, this was a normal PvP server too, not RP. So out of spite about 8 of us basically KoS every Horde we saw and post it in guild chat.
---
Eventually we all gquit, but we still occasionally talk about it 15 years later. We all became friends over it (we met in the guild) and are still buddies today. So maybe not killing Horde was really the friends we met along the way 😉
---
Pretty sure Nefarion drops 2 tier chests and then 2 of his other random items. You have 1 tier and 3 items in this story. Correct me if I'm wrong but it doesn't add up.
---
He isn't an object, he has agency. Maybe he realizes he has to put in the time to get the gear.
---
Alter the intake map and allow placement of notes, herbs, ores etc.
---
It's true that the fourth option exists, but I tried (and apparently failed) to put the evidence that it's the less likely of all the options.
---
Job being on the line means nothing to blizzard, I agree; but NOT for the people being let go, you know that those people will push forward for new content and justify their employment.   
---
I get that we're all  disappointed (at least most of us in this sub) of what blizzard did with retail. 
---
The pattern  from the past expansions does look grim, but there is the more global pattern to take into account: Blizzard is keen on keeping his franchise alive: diablo, SC, WC all have been renewed and blizzard keep coming up with ideas (sometimes bad one) to keep people playing those franchise.
---
For wow it's the same thing, they can clearly see that the game is on the decline and they're trying new ideas to support the franchise. Classic is one of these attempts (i'm pretty sure they have other leads) and IF (this is the point of discussion for me) it is successful, classic+ (in whatever form) will happen.
---
Every warrior? Eh, we're all allowed our opinions, but finding a geared warrior willing to play fully prot, or who wanted to play Fury was not common at least on my server.
---
Is Fury better? yes, were any of us ever asked to go Fury? no, we did reasonable damage, were never even close to the bottom or a hybrid spec.
---
If you're slightly not optimal for raiding, no ones going to care.
---
It's 0/30/21 and there are tons of guides for it on Youtube, just check out Skarm the tank, EBN druid or powerfulnoun
---
I've never actually considered playing druid, or hunter for that matter. I've been more stressed about whether or not I want to play shaman, mage, warlock, or priest.
---
Well I guess that's still half of WoW classes. lol.
---
Im doing 2 characters initially, 1 to level with my brother, he plays less, and another to solo.
---
Agreed 100%
---
I found it so dry and listless I just started up WC2 and listened to some mission narration for a while. Infinitely more enjoyable
---
High Quality video, but Rank 12 is actually Boots, Legs, and GLOVES. It says on the names - "General's" or "Marshal's"
---
Rank 13 is Helm, Shoulders, and CHEST. "Warlord's" or "Field Marshal's"
---
I just cut my food and sleep times in half. All about balance.
---
Yeah definitely. I don’t personally know a lot about druid healing as I played warrior in vanilla but I distinctly remember the resto druids in our guild consistently crushing the healing charts.
---
You just come here to troll people? Super confusing couple of comments.
---
Yea, it's essentially what the ESO Mega Server is.
---
For sure, offtanking is pretty easy to begin with so there is no reason to be full feral for that as long as you have the right gear. Only time you have to be full feral is if you want to actually main tank some bosses.
---
I will be leveling two characters at launch my main will be a gnome warlock with tailor enchanting and will level all secondary professions. I will also be lvling a hunter with my son who is now a adult when we can play together my hunters prof will be tailor for extra mooncloth on my main and picking herbs.once they are lvled i will begin work on a 39 twink warlock.
---
I also recommend finding the official strategy guide as a companion read for WC2. Even if you don't use it to beat the game, it guides you as if the author is an in-universe commander. It's been forever since I read that, but I enjoyed it as a kid.
---
Every warrior Tier armor set is a tank set, you will need the plate dps gear that will go to the Fury dps warriors. You can get the warrior Rank 10 gear pretty easily if you pvp enough without premade groups.
---
This is just an erroneous post and should be removed. There is absolutely no Sharding in Classic. No matter what "makes sense" to you, it's absolutely not true. 
---
Layering spans the entire continent. If your proof is the Stress Test on Beta, then what you were seeing was Blizzard messing around with the Layering tech and fine tuning, as well as there being bugs in Layering itself
---
You will be level 1 and most people who didn’t hit 20 will have quit already.
---
As a warlock, DoTimer was much needed and appreciated.
---
The tier sets give a ton of stamina so most of it is good for pvp.
---
Will leave the build for someone with more experience as MT. Probably fine when on farm? BRE is awesome if you can get your hands on it, although if you're horde 2h fury is definitely viable so you shouldn't be getting it as MT. Even on alliance during p1 use BRE on a fury warrior will be fine while you wait for viskags and deathbringers.
---
Weapon skill is very important for pve as MT but not at all important in pvp.
---
What's a better combo of four professions? I'll be relatively casual and will do pve and pvp but more pve.
---
Warlock with enchanting/ tailoring
---
Rogue with skinning/leatherwork 
---
OR
---
Warlock with alchemy/herb
---
Rogue with leatherworking/tailoring
---
Enchanting my own gear sounds great but I think I'll suck at making money with it because I'll have to sell myself on trade (because this is pre scrolls I think) and I hate marketing and often socializing.
---
Is being a leatherworker without skinning worth it?
---
Vanilla pvp is a stunfest, more so as grenades become more common, so yes in my opinion.  
---
Only other profession that gives a pvp bonus is blacksmithing.  The glimmering mythil insignia is activated 30sec fear immunity, but if you are already going engineering you will have so many trinkets in rotation that it can be hard to find enough opportunities to use it to make it feel worthwhile.  Good if you know for sure you are about to fight a warlock or priest.
---
