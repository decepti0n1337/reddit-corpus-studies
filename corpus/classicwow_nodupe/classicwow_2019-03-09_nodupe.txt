Holy accuracy

How dare you ask questions about a class that you would like to know more about. 
---
You bloody animal!
---
Play private sever.  It will give you a good refresher course.
---
To quote an earlier post you made, "It's funny how the people calling others mentally ill for no reason, are often mentally ill themselves.".

My only other reddit account is @digitocrepitus. I have no banned accounts because I don't start frothing at the mouth when people disagree with me.

I mentioned the different combos of shadowcraft to show that even with close to pre-BiS gear the bonus from combat for short fights is a trivial improvement on hemo with 0% extra hit. With sub-par gear simulated by unequipping items (to replicate levelling conditions where you'll often have gear from 10-20 levels ago) the difference in dps drops to a borderline insignificant level. You can have the username/pass for the account if you want, or I'll stream some dps tests. 
---
If you value Ghostly Strike then why don't you value a free combo point every 2nd dodge? As you agreed earlier, improved stealth and vanish means better survivability by avoiding wPVP, even though you think that 'vanishing like a rat' and avoiding gank attempts is unbecoming for a rogue. 
---
Looks like everything has been covered over your questions.
---
All I'll add is that warlock is a really fun class to play. To level, to raid and to PvP with. Give it a shot, I'm sure You'll love it.
---
I found my old main, but where do I see how long it took me to 60?
---
...It only logs your guild activities as far as i can see...
---
It's not terrible. Most of those totems are extremely situational. You can put extremely niche stuff like Windwall Totem on a bind that you would never even use on other characters. Other stuff that is relatively more useful, like Tranquil Air and Disease Cleansing Totem, see some use in PvE but never in PvP so those can also have relatively inaccessible keybinds. I never use downranked heals in PvP either so I put those on fringe keys as well.
---
Your important keybinds that you actually need to reach quickly and consistently really boil down to 3 heals, Lightning Bolt + rank 1 Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, 3 shocks + rank 1 versions of those shocks, Grounding Totem, Tremor Totem, Earthbind Totem, your 3 damage-dealing fire totems + rank 1 versions of those fire totems, Cure Poison + Poison Cleansing Totem, Nature's Swiftness OR Elemental Mastery OR Stormstrike, and your 3 magic resistance totems. Add Mana Tide totem if you're a PvE hero. 
---
Still a lot - but you have juuuuuuust enough keybinds to make it work as long as you strafe with A and D and turn with your mouse.
---
Checks out.
---
People are forgetting to mention feral is an end game option for raiding. But only if you are seriously invested in feral as going feral means 3 X the work to gear yourself as you need to be able to do every role in a raid
---
/u/DesMephisto
---
I’d say keep yourself fresh. I remember my first time visiting a private server and being blown away by how different the game was from the current game. 
---
Keep that surprise for Classic, when all the time you invest will actually be permanent. I think leveling a toon *now* is a horrible time. Either you rush to 60 in a month and have Classic coming in 2 months, or you take your time and hit 60 right when Classic launches. Either way, you could be pretty burned out before the real show.
---
Tanking is going to be a fucking nightmare for experienced tanks in pugs at first. 
---
Not level 60, but tbc black Temple farm was dope
---
Never went here but reminds me of the VKM thing in orgrimmar
---
Then that same dwarf gets raid inv over the Night elf because the guild needs fear wards
---
Rekt.
---
that isn’t classic
---
keep in mind that the tryhard pvp locks and priests are less likely to be alliance cuz of shitty racials
---
Idk, even on private servers which have slightly inflated quest rates, I found 30-40 to have some bad deadzones, unless you do *literally* every quest available. 
---
I just take it as an opportunity to grind Scarlet Monestary over and over and over and over and over and 
---
Up-vote for the art.
---
I'm a resilient masochist.
---
/u/barrsmothers does have a valid point; I happen to like the idea of their lore and the racial abilities, but I can't be a Dwarf Druid, so I'll be stuck playing that CHAD-ASS race, Night Elves.
---
Stormwind
---
How about "didn't like the way the game industry evolved".
---
That's only a private server thing. Never worked in retail so said habbit should not have formed if this is a retail video (don't know if it is, didn't check). 
---
I got rank 15! And cleared Karazhan 80 man !
---
I don't think the WoW designers played them, I think corporate told them to watch out for games like these by making their game more complicated/high budget so those sorts of games don't gain a foothold with WoW players/potential WoW players.
---
It's like, you remember when you were a kid and you were easily impressed by movies and TV shows? The animation, acting, writing and everything could all suck, but I'd be 100% into whatever movie as long as it wasn't boring. Those games look a lot like classic WoW, so some kid isn't gonna know the difference other than that one costs more, so they'll go with the cheaper one. By throwing money and features at WoW, even kids could tell "this is nothing like that WoW trial I played."
---
I would say the biggest reason is that you already have a good match up on shadow priest and Warlocks aren't that common. On the flip side though. Warriors flow through the streets like honey and rogues are also pretty common. So even if in theory UD is better. In practice Gnome is 100% better. Way more popular classes trying to get you with roots and snares over fears.
---
After many years of levelling many characters you learn to appreciate the real grinds come AFTER 60. 
---
You want epic mount: grind (or play AH from lvl 1 on an alt on 2nd monitor #protip)
---
You want flask recipes:- grind
---
You want rare enchants: grind
---
You want rep for Resist recipes : grind
---
you want discounts to Naxx attunement : grind
---
you want scarab lord : grind
---
you want r10+ in pvp : grind
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Save the grinding for when it is actually beneficial: questing is faster for EVERY class except for and AOE mage on a private realm with 50 people.
---
I get grinding is cool, my name is WYKE which is an old english word for farm.  I have been grinding for 15 years and I love it but when you are doing it below level cap you are wasting your own time, and "time is money friend".
---
I am NOT advocating racing and rushing, I am advocating efficiency.  Even the great Joanna is still looking for greater efficiencies in terms of levelling paths and thats 15 years later.  Grinding levels or even exp is never necessary or even efficient for all classes but mage or hunter, and even they are marginal.
---
I have played every class to 60 on private realms and in total I would guess around 100 different characters.  Grinding is great for unwinding, relaxing and making some income.  But there will come a time when you are either raiding naxx or grinding r14 and you will be grinding things you dont really want to be doing, but to advance your character you must do "that" grind.  
---
What I am saying is quests are free exp.  Whatever cash you are making pre 60 is insignificant in comparison to the items and gold you will acquire in reaching the level cap maybe 1-3 /played days faster.
---
I know this is my projecting my own play style on to you, but I just wanted to possibly offer you some insight from someone that has played this game to every extent.  I dont want you to dive into classic and burn-out before the final phase is released, let alone any plans blizzard have IF/WHEN they make a statement regarding future changes/progression/static state.
---
The most important part is you are missing out on a HUGE part of wow by not questing.  You are missing items, you are missing lore, stories, adventures and the opportunity to group with others and work as a team.  Almost all dungeons have quest chains and again you are missing out on basically free exp if you are entering that dungeon for an item upgrade or even a profession trainer.
---
The game has grinds, you can avoid them or you can embrace them.  Grinding mobs to level up is just not all that efficient.
---
I've been summoned. I am not u/HalLundy 's guildie. 
---
I don't believe it was deliberate, but I've always believed blizzard knew they wanted to do classic. It was their "ace in the hole" for when retail started to lose steam and the end was near. Boom. Hit the reset button and millions come flooding back.
---
Brilliant business sense if you ask me. 
---
Took me like 5 months and over 10 days played. I was a giant noob and in no rush.
---
Damn man, well said
---
... and I don't see where you fin your /played 
---
This is most definitely going in the book.
---
Wazzock.
---
eh. I don't agree 100% with that statement. I was a pretty hardcore vanilla player, and I quit halfway through TBC for reasons other than the game itself. I came back during WoTLK and found a vastly different game. Some things were similar, sure. But I felt I was out of place.
---
I understand though that not everybody would feel this way though. And where I do agree with you is that there was definitely still a sliver of vanilla left in there somewhere. The core of the game perhaps. But I think people who joined during WoTLK will not recognize "their version" of the game.
---
Last 3 days on pvp server. Got ganked 20+ times day 1 with corpse runs between 1 to 5 minutes. Day 2 got ganked 4 times. Day 3 got ganked 12 times and corpse camped by a 60 rogue for a good half hour.  The no life griefing is real.
---
There were several games that had no subscription after innital purchase which counts.
---
Aion, Rift, Wildstar, Tera were the biggest ones. Each one of them on release was classified as a "wow killer" which eventually became a joke in the scene as all of these wow killers subsequently died themselves.
---
The time and amazingnes you have put into this is quite outstanding. You should make a video. 
---
If you carry on with stuff like this I may have to change my name to paladinchris.
---
Runescape is popular solely because of grinding, despite being a terrible game in every respect. Having something to work towards is always fun.
---
Dueling: good vs. other mages to prevent shatter combos, remove slows post-blink like hamstring and crippling (blink removes stuns and roots). 
---
BGs: you don't have to deal with freedomed warriors or gnomes
---
WPvP (world bosses): you're on the side with the paladins
---
&gt;seems indicative of some sort of brain damage.
---
Strong words, we are discussing a video game here. You aren't really helping your side of the argument by lashing out like that.. Keep calm. 
---
in raiding, there are priests with so much experience that they know exactly when they'll have to pump out lots of healing, especially on the melee group. throw renews on the warriors and rogues right before they take dmg from a boss ability, then once they are missing HP, the renews start to fill it back up. this is both efficient and advantageous to your HPS. a priest i encountered on k3 uses a boss swing timer, so he knows exactly when the boss is going to melee the tank. this allows you to accurately q up a heal and it lands .1sec after the boss's melee swing.
---
knowing what spell to use, and when. if the entire raid is taking moderate dmg, blanket renewing is viable for good HPS, but you need to know if anyone needs to be topped off instantly rather than gradually. the priest i mentioned before has every rank of flash heal and greater heal bound to a left-handed numpad mouse. he can look at a health bar and instinctively know which rank of which spell is the most optimal. 
---
picking your spots with flash heal. some bosses have deadly melee combo attacks, like twin emperors (they can melee then uppercut you right after, both can crush you). flash heal is oftentimes the only way you're guaranteed to land a heal on the tank before they die. spamming flash heal rank 7 is only viable if you are facerolling the content (basically, if you have it on farm). 
---
It won't be more popular than retail but it will get a sub out of me.
---
This is an interesting perspective to me. I honestly have never enjoyed the UD starting zone but have played several characters through it. I would honestly have to say that I enjoyed the human and Tauren zones the most. I never managed to do the Orc or gnome zones past a certain level, but always thought they were interesting. The Nelf zone was a beautiful cluster
---
...never got past level 14 on any character. 
---
You really dont want to bind cheetah with another aspect, trust me. Picture a situation where you have cheetah up and you want to avoid being dazed in a fight, do you want to silence yourself for the next 1.5 seconds to prevent that by casting monkey/hawk or just turn off cheetah and leave yourself still able to wingclip or feign death?
---
Moreover, if you bind cheetah and monkey/hawk onto the same keybind I don't think you can turn off cheetah while your GCD is on.
---
I think you are severely gimping yourself if you force these two huge restrictions when trying to pvp during tense fights.
---
stay bad
---
I like to do stuff like ctrl g for grounding, ctrl b for binding, ctrl s for searing, ctrl w for windfury, helps me learn it.  
---
Those all came out after the period the OP references. 
---
Aion and Rift absolutely had subscriptions. Not sure why you’d include those.....
---
Where do you get those 99 days from?
---
Yeah I just don’t seem them registering. 
---
It’s like asking if the guys from Coke occasionally take ideas from grocery store brand soda. They just don’t.

Back to making nonsensical statements, I see.  
---
What are you actually on about mate?  
---
Disagree with me? Don't be so full of yourself. You're trying to disagree with me, and you're failing at that as well, simply because you have zero understanding of what you're talking about.
---
There's also something to be said about you going through old posts and that frothing at the mouth bit you mentioned, however that's a very low hanging fruit for my taste.  
---
&gt; I mentioned the different combos of shadowcraft to show that even with close to pre-BiS gear the bonus from combat for short fights is a trivial improvement on hemo with 0% extra hit. With sub-par gear simulated by unequipping items (to replicate levelling conditions where you'll often have gear from 10-20 levels ago) the difference in dps drops to a borderline insignificant level.  
---
I completely understand what you're trying to do and you're trying to accomplish with your "testing". And I already explained to you that your simplistic views on the matter are not comparable to the leveling experience.  
---
I'm not going to waste my time by explaining this for a third time. If you're interested in learning something new, that's based in fact, then go look it up. If not, just keep vomiting this bs. It's highly entertaining.
---
I’m in! Unsubbed from retail after going 7/8M in uldir. Pm me the discord!
---
Nah you nuts
---
Druid, Druid, Druid
---
Warrior pally mage
---
My vote would probably be warrior/ret pally/discholy priest. My argument is you really want a warrior (ms/dps/hamstring), you need offensive and defensive dispel, and you really want double defensive dispel (otherwise your support will just get fear/poly and be useless). The problem with warrior and pally/priest healer is you will have trouble taking caps and killing things with just 1 dps. For instance if there's a holy priest and resto druid guarding something they can tank a single dps warrior for a long time, but with 2 dps you'll be able to kill anyone reasonably quickly even through healing.
---
Not as many keybinds as Perplexity. 76 I think.
---
If you level with Blessing of Wisdom instead of Might and keep your first aid current, you have barely any downtime at all.
---
[This is how](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZxhZVbLtrcq) I leveled my last Paladin.
---
It's super braindead; just cast seal, judge, recast seal and alt tab.
---
Boomkin, Boomkin, Boomkin?
---
I dont understand how any of that helps when you get ganked. Gankers arent goin around fighting their own level if you are getting ganked 9/10 its a rogue with a skull where his level is and you never saw him coming. The other 1/10 it was a 60 rushing you on their mount so being aware and saving cooldowns isnt doing anything but making you less efficient at levelling.  The same level people almost jever engqge because then the loser comes back and just waits for the other dude to have a mob or two on him and gets revenge then no one levels...
---
You talk about 1% of the population who does it like that. imo, take it easy, enjoy the journey and let it overcome you
---
Wanting retail to fail isn’t toxic. If retail fails, it will likely bring forth a new MMO with Vanilla’s core values at the forefront. 
---
The biggest advantage for a gnome mage is it has the upper hand against an undead mage in duels simply because they can break frost nova. 
---
Warriors and rogue are free kills for any mage so the gnome racial barely makes a difference. It does help though, especially if you're well out-geared. It also helps escaping a druid when low on HP.
---
On the other hand the undead racial makes warlocks a fair match. However priests are still dangerous as ever.
---
&gt; No. You need to have played Vanilla back in the day to UNDERSTAND what it means.
---
Holy gatekeeping.
---
I like how they give that jacked troll such a small raptor to ride. With such a huge rider  + armor it looks like it would get worn out after a couple hundred yards
---
Troll Mage MQJ+Berserking gonna nab up all of the black lotus in AV. 
---
Oops I now read your statement. My bad dude.
---
Imagine thinking anyone wants WotLK because of Nostalgia. 😂😂 Not like the classes were the most refined and the skill cap of arena was at its peak. 
---
Shush.
---
Wasn't stealth super slow at first? Sneak suffered a speed penalty until you specced into an improved version? Am I remembering that right? 
---
Mind quickening jem?
---
Sorry, I forgot that being the guy that *tanks* all the mobs stops being considered as tanking when you reach a certain level of gear.
---
Ahh I see, miscommunication. My bad, I'm not saying they stole their ideas. I was trying to imply that if they had let those games become sort of big, and then ignored the WoW audience when the audience wanted LFG and flying mounts, for example, those other games would've done those things in a second and stole a ton of business from WoW.
---

---
I think you  selected "I don't udnerstand this" in your multiple choice test in the background &gt;_&gt;
---
This guy thinks everything that doesn't align with his 2006 mindset of how Vanilla was is from pservers and therefore bad and can't be possible in Classic.
---
Yeah, it was a movement speed decrease unless you talent into the bonus in the subtlety tree 
---
Classic wow legends? Lmao classic isn’t even released yet.
---
If you actually think these two are gonna be relevant when it comes to top level pvp in actual classic when you will have rank 1 arena players from retail playing it you are delusional, both monkeynews and esfand are 2k~ players, you will see that the difference is enormous.
---
You sir win todays internetz...
---
First the WoW needle, and then the WoW dildo... Be careful what you insert, is the lesson of this story.
---
Same, I don't find them interesting. All the other classes operate in a way that I find more appealing than pew-pew + pet.
---
Warrior hunter paly are the best choice by miles. Blesing of freedom on hunter is worth alot and u want people to focus a warri cause of rage. Trying to fcous a hunter wont work at all. Double warrior is only strong later on when rage is generated more quickly. Warrior do not benefit from rogues cause of stunlocks. They need damage input to be viable. Hunter and paly have a nice synergy
---
He's talking out of his ass since he didn't personally see druid tanks in 2006 and it means they couldn't possibly exist. Your main issue as druid tank is tanking raids. You're the best dungeon tank there is as long as you have a clue what you're doing.
---
Yeah you're crazy 
---
"Let’s say you increase your weapon skill by 4.
---
Against a mob 3 levels higher than you, you get: 0.8% lower chance to miss, 0,4% lower chance to get dodged, 2,4% to be parried, and a 0,8% higher chance to crit. That means a 4,8% net increase."
---
Taken from a blue post around the release of BC. The general consensus on Pservers was 3% increase in hits. 
---
It also had a "large" and loyal fanbase from not only the warcraft franchise but also Diable.
---
I mained Gnome Rogue in Classic and still to this day in retail. 
---
They’re awesome. Both thematically and gameplay. Removing a root is huge. Instantly get back on that mage after frost nova! 
---
It’s also fun to beat up on big Tauren and orcs as a little gnome.

---
But people like you are worse, way worse than the "min max nerds" this sub is shitting on 24/7.
---
Those games could have done all of those things and they still would not have made an impact. They really weren’t actual competiton. 
---
Who cares if you can casually raid, via lfr, in a game that has 1/10 the art and encounter design budget of WoW. For example. 
---
Those features wouldn’t have made up for the overall poor quality of those games, their lack of name recogniziton, their lack of marketing.....
---
It's fucking amazing with English subtitles too.  :D
---
What if they cancel classic and decide on wow classic mobile instead ? 
---
Hey would be pretty good to enter the mobile market and make $$$$ out of micro transactions..
---
Imagine that
---
Hunter has you beat.
---
I highly doubt it, although its a possibility.
---
Two reasons, neither of which really involve differences between private servers and blizzard official servers. First, it's *really* tough to properly gear a druid tank. For early-mid game leveling, you'll be fine with greens and the occasional blue, but as far as regular 5 man endgame dungeons, the pickin's are scarce. You'll probably be better off healing for those dungeons and picking up the druid tanking gear as you go (which shouldn't be hard, it's mostly useless for rogues.) 
---
Secondly, it's rough on healers. Bear tanks work by having enough health and armor to sponge whatever is coming at them. You will take significantly more damage over the course of a fight than a similarly geared warrior tank, and the damage will come in bigger spikes due to your inability to become uncrittable through defense gear.
---
It still works if you really want to make it happen, and you're much better off than a paladin in that regard. If you just want to run 5 mans as a bear, you'll be fine.
---
Rogue can stealth farm some instances. You also basically need a rogue to do dire maul tribute runs.
---
Why would people who play retail right now be the best 
---
Tbh im new to vanilla so im unsure how big of a factor that is.
---
What’s the point of this post? You’re upset that people are talking about/getting hyped for a game under its own sub reddit? If you don’t care for classic, why are you complaining about what people are saying about classic in the classic subreddit? Unreal. Go cry somewhere else.
---
Its the modern macro system.  No more /run or / script stuff.

[He's actually quite fond of movies](https://ew.com/article/2015/09/22/pope-francis-visit-movies-philadelphia/). I remember a news interview after some film several years ago showing a cozy entertainment room that looked kind of what you would expect to see in an old man's house. Nothing ostentatious, kind of looked like my grandpas den.  
---
The "raid or die" mentality by the developers started in TBC which is when WoW died to me.
---
It's actually crazy how WoW tries to cater to casuals more and more every expac but has less and less for casuals to do, while vanilla was the least casual version of WoW and the one that casuals had the most to do in.
---
Raiding shouldn't be the only thing worth doing(and no, M+ doesn't count it's do your+10 for the week then done).
---
Yikes man u really dont know who monkeynews is then :D
---
all good. GL in Azeroth
---
Obviously a different game, especially the power level of chars leveling up, but the core is still there
---
Orc sham best sham
---
Go feral. The difference is minimal as long as you have a decent healing set and you get 20% intellect from the second to last row of feral talents. You don't want to level as resto spec, trust me.
---
As for the open world, you should be fine just putting a rejuv on yourself+them between pulls to keep both of you topped off.
---
I am well aware who he is, and the only retail he played after tbc was 1.8k arenas in legion where spam lost after making complete beginner mistakes over and over, even deleted the vods of it because I guess it was too embarrassing to keep.
---
Just wait and see till classic is released.
---
Oh wow, seems that not only can you see the future, but you are extremely passionate about it too. I remember my first beer. 
---
Hell, i just want anything that is pre LFD/LFR/Xrealm. Ill take anything that promotes community of Queues. 
---
Best advice is to go Orc Warlock and Orc Shaman unless you play on a PvE server. 
---
One time I had a tank whisper me for a BRD run I was forming where he wanted something like 40g, all boe's, and all unneeded bop's. I just laughed and found another tank a few min later.
---
That's me! I quit immediately after Legion launched because I hate what they did to the classes; way too much pruning, too many abilities were spec-specific.
---
They have focused group testing showing we're all wrong and more people are subbing and playing due to how they designed BFA than leaving blah blah blah.
---
Reading that i see that you dont know mutch about his history :D
---
There is a reason he gets tons of veiws on his youtube even tho hes a pserver player. Also he was one of the top streamer on twitch when the demo was live. Again there is a reason why people watch this guy
---
Thanks bud. 
---
well, I think there is probably more people out there who played wow at some point but quit, than there are retail subscribers right now.
---
Not uh! We all get along perfectly fine! /s
---
Hunter. I love every aspect of it in both PVP and PVE. 
---
* Fast leveling
---
* Best endgame PVE rotation
---
* Completely OP in low level PVP
---
* Extremely strong in PVP if you know what you're doing
---
* Lots of utility in dungeons/raids (being responsible with pulling, kiting extra mobs in clutch moments, traps, etc.)
---
* I don't mind the poor scaling DPS in AQ/Naxx because I don't expect to be #1 in the meters in the first place
---
* The only class I enjoy healing as in raids is Shaman
---
* I don't want to get RSI from powershifting /s
---
yeah.....you've never seen a geared mage AOE farm
---
[Current build I use](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AAUz1MxDQAPPFMA)
---
I have enough raid gear that I can dual-wield tank dungeons in a mix of tank and dps gear.  For raids, I'm usually a 3 or 4 tank so the build fits the role very nicely.
---
The build also allows you to swap to 1h/shield for some serious tank fights if you do need to MT for a week, or the MT happens to die, etc.  It's basically like the new 31/5/15.
---
&gt;I won't have any issues
---
yah, but he wont have issues with that
---
Loco seems pretty calm to me. Flippant replies are a normal response to whataboutisms. You did reply to a comment regarding this sub, not r/wow, after all.
---
I don't know where this "r/wow hates classic" lie comes from. Classic discussions, memes, news, and art regularly tops r/wow, and the comments are largely positive. 
---
What if you actually wanted to roll Dwarf priest? I always go Dwarf if the option is there.
---
I advocate PvE.  To each their own, but I don’t have time to spend running to my corpse when I get killed on my warrior for the 500th time.
---
I’ll miss a lot of the fun world opportunities to help out in PvP battles in the world, but I just don’t have time for that.
---
Just throwing out my 2 cents because why not?!
---
Because most “top” players that play private severs are rejects from retail, of course there are exceptions like perplexity for example who is a good player, but most of these private server players wouldn’t be close to gladiator rating in most expansions, and the difference between gladiator and rank 1 is huge, you’ll see the difference when rank 1 retail players will play in classic, just wait :)
---
Having played Vanilla and leveled 3 chars to 60, I can assure you most players had issues. It’s a lot more difficult when you don’t have YouTube videos and add ons running in the background to help.
---
Also, back in the day people liked exploring and weren’t all just leveling monsters.

By typing in alternate caps like a meme spewing idiot you've invoked **Cheng's Law**. Your argument is now invalidated.  Please try again later. Thanks!
---
Depends what kind of solo class you prefer. Would you rather play a class that can kite for minutes on end extremely hard enemies until they die or one that doesn't need to kite and instead pet-tanks/facetanks easier enemies?
---
Two options to your racial issues:
---
* Pick a "suboptimal" race because looks&gt;OP pvp racials
---
* Abuse noggenfogger/deviate delights to hide your ugly face
---
And if you want a raid spot, warlock is always assured one, especially on alliance since people tend to roll alliance warlocks less because UD racial shuts them down so hard. Hunter is more competitive for sure.
---
*hides my level 1 crusader sword*
---
This is a very good point, for a warrior being smacked on you want as much quest exp as possible as every hit you take is costing you repair bills and/or bandages.
---
You just macro cancelaura for cheetah with the likes of Wing Clip or Raptor Strike. If you're in melee range to WC you generally don't want Cheetah in the first place. 
---
Ideally you'd just have it bound by itself anyway. The only Aspects I macro'd together were Monkey/Hawk, and Cheetah/Pack IIRC.
---
Correct, retail = current official state. A while ago, private servers were the only expectation for playing vanilla wow, hence "retail" being the contrast. 
---
A brief timeline of wow, each period lasting 2 years:  
---
Vanilla(aka Classic)  
---
TBC  
---
WotLK  
---
Cata  
---
MoP  
---
WoD  
---
Legion  
---
BfA (current)
---
Want a tissue while you cry about somebody crying?
---
 actual question, are you joking when you say those two spells actually increase gathering time? 
---
didnt play vanilla
---
Didn't click back then, no changes for me is fine! 
---
Different people like playing different ways. Who am I to tell someone what they should or should not enjoy?
---
Nelf Female Priest Mid 30s with Black Mageweave...
---
Oooh yeah
---
Didn’t even play horde and this looked like that shitty zone. Give us back our city you scum. 
---
I imagine they won't allow that kind of macro with the API changes we're getting. You could do it with castsequence, but not buff checks.
---
It was the shittiest zone there was. 
---
* Hunter
---
&gt; I do not like the fact the class is crowded and that I won't be desirable to groups/raids. 
---
Then make yourself desirable. Be proactive and pull off ludicrous things like taking charge of the CC with traps of peeling mobs off the healer whenever they get aggro. Be the hunter that people want to group with and not the huntard that everyone avoids. That being said it's true there's a lot of hunters all over the place and it can be a pain to get into groups, but that's only true for raids IMO.
---
That being said, if you want a guaranteed raid spot, go shaman. I haven't messed around with the PVP aspect too much, but healing in raids was a blast with them. Totems are much more fun to use than pally blessings (even if they suck in comparison) and your melees will love you if you totem twist. Being able to ignore the 5s rule for the most part is also pretty neat.
---
One nitpick though:
---
&gt; OR melee in PVE 
---
Enhancement shaman is the worst hybrid PVE spec out every single meme spec. Elemental shamans also have a glaring flaw (no curse that removes nature resist and mana costs through the roof) but they're not as useless as enhances. Elemental at least has the potential to be strong. Enhancement brings nothing useful to the table. Their improved totems amount to 10-20 additional strength for your melees. Their Nightfall uptime is the straight up worst out of every class. Their DPS is abysmal.
---
I've not really heard about any hate about grind on this sub. But well maybe you're right.
---
The only grinding aspect I find unacceptable in Classic is farming gold for respeccing.
---
Grinding for consumes is normal, it's absolutely not mandatory to do it, and it does not bring you anything in term of game experience, except the feeling of being a badass with big numbers. Grinding for a rep, a recipe or a mount, you do it once, it's a goal-accomplishment kind of thing. That's cool.
---
But for a thing like respecing,, having a high cost for it simply discourages people from playing different aspects of the game when you feel like it. And you are damned to do it forever regularly if you want to enjoy playing different things.
---
Wanna raid with your guild in the beginning of the evening and PvP right after to chill, with the role you want? Ok but 50 golds (+ 50 for the next activity).
---
Are you an hybrid and just feel like alternating roles often because you enjoy that, whether in PvP or in 20 mans / pugs? Nope, that's 50 golds each time. Many classes/roles/specs (tanking, rogue pve vs pvp, heal in pve vs dps in pvp, etc ) can't do that without having to respec.
---
So yeah, that is the only very stupid grind in my opinion. It only pleases preachers of "economy", because blabla without economy our gold mafia minmaxed on pservers won't work, because blabla it's a gold sink, blabla it forces to make original and unoptimal spec. And why? Only for the sake of sparing gold of course. Yay.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** j_harv! ^(hug)
---
I'm out of the loop. What can non-raiders do in classic that they can't do in retail?
---
A tanks biggest issue is usually generating enough threat to stay ahead of the dps... so anything that increases threat is what you want
---
Wrong; level 58 priests could go into MC and be decently geared. 
---
You need to be an engineer to use anything engineering-related (except those lvl 1 dynamites). Leatherworking is neat to have if you're leveling casually and craft some pieces for yourself but useless in the lategame for your own use. I'd drop LW for engineering eventually and potentially skinning for mining or herb.
---
only a terrible raiding guild would prioritize a racial ability over player skill and temperament
---
I was pretty ignorant of scripts my early wow life, what kind of classic-era scripts are you referencing? 
---
naxx was wotlk
---
I loved my NE priest. The best was doing arenas with other NE and stealthy chars. Kept the other guys guessing and helped with mount kiting as well. 
---
Yeah there is. I had two 60s in vanilla, I was around 15 years old. People seem to think I need to prove it too, it’s great. Like no, I didn’t dedicate two weeks over my summer break to grinding 1-60 on a rogue in under two weeks real time (sub 7 days played) and lose some weight and become nocturnal. That didn’t happen. Why would I make that up 😂 then they get hostile that you played it for whatever reason. Maybe they are just mad they missed it. My brother raised original naxx, up to saph. He still had T3 on retail but he never plays. 
---
How do you make a cancel aura macro for cheetah?
---
Much appreciated. Paladins had the best theorycrafters on the old forums so it's nice to see this lives on.
---
I'd say it's the exact same as being a DPS in the sense that you shouldn't mindlessly focus on the raid frames just like a DPS shouldn't mindlessly do their rotation without getting out of the fire. A clean UI makes healing a lot easier. Have as little things cluttering your screen and it makes a world of difference.
---
All in all I'd say it's kind of watching a video with subtitles on? Except you're looking at the fight instead of the video, and keeping track of the raid's health instead of reading the subtitles.
---

Aside from bank alts. Me.
---
My vanilla -&gt; BFA Paladin has something like 100x the combined /played of all other characters combined.
---
I have no need for alts, aside from bank / bagspace.
---
I don't know about in actual vanilla but it works on pservers.

---
Funnily, Dwarfs are always the most chill race/class combo except when it comes to Priests. 
---
Wouldn't humans just be useless in pvp though? Considering gnome helps in open world and premades along with engineering wouldnt gnome be better for all aspects of the game?
---
Phew, I almost started to question the validity of my desire to have only one single character. Other thing is, I wont be able to play nearly as much as I have been when I was in high school, and that also pushes me towards one single toon. But mostly the sort of "RP" reasons. I wanna be a character, not a player with characters.
---
Would you say gnome is better for overall gameplay then, if i plan to min-max for pvp but still want to be well rounded overall?

What’s the reason?
---
Most was answered, but a few things:
---
3) While you spam shadowbolt in raids, affliction is good enough for farming, 5mans, and pvp. I'd recommend starting with 30/0/21 (SM/ruin) - it gets you all the good affliction tools for outside of raids, while doing work in raids, until you move to the demonic sac build.  
---
7.5) Don't be afraid to pick up a temporary profession. Even if you want tailoring for bloodvine, that's quite a ways down the road. You have time to check the market &amp; see what you can profit from meanwhile  
---
9.5) Warlocks tend to be a shade underrepresented, so your tier &amp; +shadow damage comes faster, but mages will be very common competition. Overall, warlocks are only slightly easier to gear imo
---
11. The good old 30/0/21 (SM/ruin) is viable in pvp, but if you want to trade damage for survivability, go demonic to get soul link. 
---
12. I think female orc works the best, but that's just me
---
Necropile Raiment 2 pc bonus: +3 defense. It's a cloth set.
---
Either:
---
1. Warrior, Holy Paladin, Druid
---
2. Warrior, Holy Paladin, Mage
---
Holy Paladin's biggest weakness is Curse of Tongues and both mages and druids can remove it.
---
Maaaaannn - I don’t lol often but this one got me.  Have an upvote you brilliant bastard. 😂
---
You do you, but it doesn't break my immersion to have bank alts. Surely my adventurer knows a guy or two that can help manage the loot and resources?
---
Agreed - I love me a good dwarf.
---
lick my balls
---
This is amazing. 
---
Art from patch 5.3.0 :thinking:
---
The "average player" won't finish leveling in 3 months *because they will have quit before level 30*. 
---
I played Vanilla, and haven't played it at all since then until the demo came out (via pserver). It was a huge shock to the system of how grindy, slow, and boring (read: both levelling and classes) it was compared to how it is now. My nostalgia and going "ooh I remember this" was broken by the time I got to about level 5 after being annoyed by the lack of auto loot and having to supermacro script for basic macros, and just didn't bother logging back in after getting to 17 or so, bored of grinding Barrens. 
---
The kicker to that is the fact most **average players** are absolutely awful and will rage at the fact they just got killed  in the starting zone because they pulled two casters and got 2 shot. If they get past that, the likes of Echo Isles trolls if they don't know to go north first, or Barrens grinds will kill them off. Now, this of course all depends on how they handle the launch though.
---
It will have a huge launch, nobody is denying that - It will either be great or absolutely shit depending on how they handle tagging, spawns, and sharding - but it will be huge, and that's the problem. People won't be able to level if there's so many people and spawns aren't matching (without mob tagging people are used to currently), other hardcore nochanges players will refuse to play if there's sharding. If you happen to log into a server a big streamer is playing, you've fucked it. 
---
So with all that said (no clue how it got so long, sorry), I know it will keep players for a decent amount of time, but those it keeps will be the few that play servers currently and a few extra who didn't want to play servers that get shut down and waste time, or think they'd get sued or whatever by Blizzard for playing them. I might play it myself but it will have to be casually, I won't be raiding and I won't get anywhere near enough time to even consider HWL - so that already means I'm playing it for the sake of playing it, mostly WPvPing, and it will very much depend on the API/Addons/Macros we are able to use too because fuck all that old nonsense requiring supermacro. People just don't have the patience to play such a game any more, and if they do, chances are they don't have the time these days. That includes me unfortunately.
---
People from retail are biased(that prefer retail at least). It’s annoying hearing people talk about stuff they don’t understand. Anybody that thinks retail is great and classic will suck should be ignored when it comes to gaming knowledge. They are like people that think the only restaurant should be McDonalds.
---
You could do the same one horde side, troll vs undead.
---
Troll is Chad of course
---
decursive is a pretty huge crutch. Vanilla will be very different without it.
---
Obviously bank alts whose sole purpose is to provide bag space and nothing else isnt really against my intentions also. Its not something that you could call an alt anyway. Only thing against them is my OCD which wanna see a 1 character only character box, but I also think at some point im gonna make a bank alt.
---
In 1.12 do you still have to click on the vein multiple times to mine all its ore (and stone)?
---
Depends, if we get the 7.3.5 API, you could do it with a simple "/cancelaura Aspect of the Cheetah". If it's the current, you'd have to use Supermacro and do
---
/run if IsCurrentAction(13) then UseAction(13) end;
---
or
---
/run if IsCurrentAction(13) then CastSpellByName("Aspect of the Cheetah") end;
---
He does nothing else with his life but play private server vanilla, quit his job so he could play full time and he’s pretty much the only warrior releasing videos and streaming it, people watch it because he’s pretty much the only one doing it, not because he’s good, oh and the only ones watching him is the private server community.
---
He nolifes the game and always have bis gear throughout every phase. His videos basically consists of him killing undergeared people. He has knowledge of the game but mechanically he’s not a top player, retail standards that is.
---
you’re gonna pay for a second account to have a level 1 bank alt on your second monitor?

Wtf happened

Haha, though you were playing bfa,then i recognized the different ranks of your spells in your spell book. Classic server?

Reckoning Bomb

Week 2 MC is definitely doable, it's not going to be done by random people who meet up after launch, it's going to be done by guilds that have already started planning. I'm in one of these guilds and I plan on completely no-lifing it once Classic launches by pull 144 hours the first week and then running 18 hour days until we've cleared MC. I'm hoping to hit 60 and be able to farm MC trash at the end of the first week but I don't know if that's actually realistic. I've got a personal server I'm practicing my leveling route on and with a GM account and some GM items I've gotten my 1-54 route down to under 24 hours (at which point I'll start grinding rep/patterns/dungeons to 60).
---
Once I have the leveling route fully optimized via GM items I'm going to do some legit runs to see how long it will take me to hit 60 so I can have an idea of where I'll land at the end of week 1. I'm probably one of the exceptions in regards to people rushing to 60 and trying to clear MC week 2, but if you have a group of like minded individuals it's definately doable. If you plan on just winging it and trying to find other people after launch you have virtually 0 chance of clearing MC by week 2.
---
Alright this got me good
---
Atm i don't have a set guild going into classic but for personal reasons Pvp is super enjoyable and I feel like not having escape artist in pvp sucks more than not having wep spec in PvE could be wrong about that though. One thing I do know is pvp and premade bgs are definitely something I want to do often.
---
you seem like you want everything given to you for free. maybe check out retail. 
---
wowhead has a race requirement listed on the Undead mount items, and Tauren is excluded. I'm not 100% sure this is accurate, but it seems oddly specific. Also it's tough to find a screenshot of a Tauren on one.

Enough time to end this guy.

I'm pretty sure this was before 1.12 where each race had its own unique type of mount training but I could be wrong. I know before 1.12 for example that Gnomes had mechanostrider training that was only for dwarves and gnomes but with 1.12 they removed speciality type trainings.

Not because I don't like them (quite the opposite!) It's just that my friends and I are playing Alliance come Classic launch. We play (played...) Horde for the past 10+ years so it's time to go back to Alliance for a bit - should be a nice change. 
---
I hope it stays that way personally, but it's not confirmed AFAIK. I'll gladly accept /cancelaura and /mouseover instead of

I've been leaning PVE the whole time.  I've had several dozen people try to convince me to go pvp, but nobody has really come at it from the angle I'm angling for.  I'm a father with a full time job, and a wife.  I have very little time to play the game I want to play.  The pros of world pvp allure me to be sure.  But the cons outweigh it more now than before when i was just a coward. 
---
I agree, you have a reasonable ananlysis of the situation. I think you are underestimating how many people are outside of this Classic bubble who will play the game and become hooked.
---
There's a fairly well-known screenshot/copypasta about vanilla paladins being designed to watch porn

A man can wish lol but I’m happy healing for raids and causing frustration in WPvP
---
Pally healing is super chill and easy especially when you first get Blessing of Light. Its the leveling that SERIOUSLY needs a second monitor to watch Netflix on.
---
That decides it. I'm rolling a human priest. 
---
I might be, I'm not saying it will fail by any means, it has a big and consistent fan base that's for sure. I just think people are also over estimating how many people will stay from those who don't currently play Vanilla servers, specifically those who never played Vanilla or haven't played it in a long time. Huge difference in the games.
---
Like someone else said, it's the modern system. As I recall, no need to add /startattack prefixes for abilities.

Long shot, nice pun

Troll is BiS PvE both specs and Shadow PvP, though. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
A couple things to add - 1) devilsaur gear is BoE, so you might prefer to not level LW yourself, 2) other BoP engineering perks include Tanaris port (great for AQ progression, especially for alliance) and arcanite dragonling (if your guild is really pushing hard), 3) Jumper cables are extra clutch on hunters, with your fancy feign death
---
Priest, warlock, and shaman.  Priest always gave off that bland , boring, and plain vibe to me

Rolling an optimal race is just a retard check. Doesn’t have anything to do with viewing the game as a job.

The most staggering thing, to me at least, is how quickly Classic fans will use anti-Classic arguments to attack retail and its fans. Short, pithy denunciations like, "They're just addicted to the insta-gratification," "They're caught in the sunk-cost fallacy," and "They're just nostalgic for the game" are all regularly thrown in regards to retail fans. Any astute observer should notice how similar these simplistic arguments are to the ones thrown at Classic fans. 
---
In both cases, these arguments are attempts on the part of the speaker to invalidate the other persons enjoyment of WoW by telling them how they don't enjoy the game. They're telling them, "You don't *really* enjoy this game. There has to be something deeper going on here! No one could like this, there's something wrong with you." 
---
It can't be that the person they're talking to just enjoys Classic/Retail and thinks it's fun. It has to be a trick of some deeper psychology. They have to be addicted to "instant-gratification." They have to be "nostalgia-blind." 
---
This form of argumentation didn't originate with this Retail/Classic debate, it's been around forever. But it shows up more in this particular debate than anywhere else in games, and it's just so baffling to me. It always comes off as condescending, and it always leads to a failure to actually understand why people enjoy either form of the game. It's an attempt to punch down, to say to someone else, " I know you better than you know yourself," instead of actually trying to figure out why people like what they like.
---
It was wrong for Brack to use this argument to categorically dismiss Classic fans as people who just thought they wanted something, but really didn't. It's wrong for Retail fans to use it to dismiss all Classic fans as nostalgia-blind. Finally, it's wrong for Classic fans to use it to dismiss fans of the modern game as nothing more than people addicted to instant gratification. The whole WoW community would be better off if we put it to bed. 
---
Shaman have Farsight, Stoneclaw and Ghost wolf. Pretty close to the Hunter tool kit. Obviously pets will be much better for distracting mobs.

Some of the talents vary per person. It's a pretty flexible talent path from my understanding.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20182](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20182) \- and it stacks up to 5 times. Early on in vanilla it hadn't a stack cap so when it was discovered it was used to "oneshot" world bosses.
---
That’s the plan so far
---
My condolences....it’ll be hard but we literally talked about classic wow so often I feel it’s my duty to play 
---
Good example of stuff changing: warriors using /sit to proceed enrage. Alot of guides right now specifically suggest leveling fury until at least level 40. Is that with the assumption that /sit will always cause a crit? Is arms actually better to level with true vanilla-like behaviour?

How is Powerless doing Staysafe?

Nope. See the one I linked.

I hope MC/Ony as the first raids will have a release date and won't be available from day one. It's fun (and sane) when you have like 2 months to level and prepare for the opening of the raids.

Lol my lazy friend raided MC like 5 times at 58. Got himself attuned but getting himself to 60 was agonizing 😂

Not even necessary here. 
---
Paladin had 1 stack of Reckoning.
---
- So hit 1 time
---
- reckoning 2nd hit
---
- Seal of Command proc.
---
Also level 47 melee vs 42 clothie
---
BY choice though? Or because you couldn't find others? Because honestly the ideal raid compositions just don't call for many druids because what they bring to the table in a raid isn't as good as a priest, pally, or shaman. They definitely have their place, but I don't see more serious guilds bring more than 2-3 when they could bring another shaman or priest instead. Which, if you do get yourself into a guild and have a spot there for raiding, is actually great because you have to compete with fewer people for tier gear. It's one of the things I like about being a hunter. Good guilds aren't bringing more than 2-3 hunters because they fall off after MC in terms of damage, but are still needed for the utility. Much rather work my way into a good guild and compete with one or two other people for gear than roll a mage and compete with 6+. So there's a definite trade-off there that can be detrimental at first, and then really awesome once you do secure a raid spot in the guild you choose to join.

You thought it was intelligent to base an argument on this sub that includes the words retail, arena, and some imaginary rating?

Very true when I was 14 haha, staying up way to late, being half asleep in class and being overweight.

Although ‘Hardcore’ as in, working full time in a job I enjoy, still hitting the gym and living with my gf.

Sure I’m going to take a week off work (come on release date, I need to book that in!) but, I think a lot of ‘Vanilla Vets’ are in similar situations, we want to play ‘hard core’ but now being older, #AdultingSucks haha.

Honestly, I know I’ll be playing less hours than my 14 year old self although, now with more knowledge I feel I’ll get way further and be much more time efficient.

You can macro them with sharpkeys, it works on my merc stealth

If you already have a guild group that you're planning on playing with... then Rogues are amazing to play.

It can be difficult to get into guilds with one, since everyone wants to play one. (Or at least they did back in Vanilla)
---
Mages get pretty shafted when it comes to set bonuses. There are some noteworthy ones like full T2, but overall it's pretty unremarkable.
---
Think about it, more buffs without having to drink, cuts down prep time between wipes, gives your raid that extra pull every night, eventually means you start downing bosses before the other guilds. Clearly it is the hidden OP.
---
Most people were casual and didn't care about vanilla nor did they care that the game evolved. 
---
SM + MC... the sacred horde-destroying combo

Paladin, because I'd have to roll alliance.
---
Dude that's like 1 less tick of regen needed while eating+drinking. Imagine the time savings.
---
This I made this a long tome ago
---
I love them, I think they have one of the highest skill ceilings in the game and they definitely have the best class fantasy of all the classes. Just all the little things you need to do like feeding your pet and staying stocked up on food for him, buying ammo, I actually really like that that exists. They also have the most involved pve rotation of any class. There's really a lot more to it than pew-pew + pet. I'm not saying you should roll one for sure, but don't count them out entirely. 
---
I'm just going off the "first seen" to the date it logged me at 60. Checking my emails to see when I purchased WoW and it seems to be correct.

I would love if he only rolled holy Palladin or holy Priest, and no other classes. Didn't even spend any talents outside the holy trees.

Yeah, Shaman is much more fun to play with Chain Heal and its plethora of other damage/utility spells, but having to manage totems was just a pain in the ass. Especially the shorter-duration ones like Mana Spring. I'm already slightly annoyed having to rebuff every 15 minutes on a Paladin, having to re-plop totems every 1-2 minutes, yeah no thanks.
---
Psssh, imagine choosing to be a weird gangly purple gibbon man when you could be a glorious lil hairy meatball Scot. 
---
Hi, /u/Spectralwhale
---
Found the min max nerd
---
&gt;What's with the hate for grinding?
---
It's absolutely braindead. I play games for fun, not to simulate a dead-end job.
---
&gt; You see LF1M need tank and that's you. You see LF1M need healer and that's you. You see LFM any/dps and that's you.
---
Yeah, that's what YOU see. Everyone else see's themselves still looking for one more.
---
Good luck with Classic then...

Care to elaborate? That's the pvp ele spec. 
---
haha! You just made me laught! Up-vote for your creativity :P
---
I’ve been downvoted on this sub before for saying that dwarf priests weren’t the most common.
---
Apparently people are much more min/max on private servers than they were in vanilla. Dwarf priests were rare, my whole guild had one or two. Most raids had one at most, but if you ask a lot of the people on this sub, every single priest is forced to roll dwarf...
---
Perhaps abit of both. Threat by nature is hard to get an accurate gauge on. like some meters gave an indication but despite a tank being top, brood would switch.
---
We usually just made locks calm the fek down to avoid wiping as it was the one fight that you really didn't wanna have to do again with the suppression room and all.
---
It was like that even when BWL was on farm it was abit speed but with pragmatism sprinkled in there aswell.
---
I smitty the fool!
---
You mean?
---
Ok so this might be a bit unorthodox but I am looking for the easiest class possible. I enjoy the grinds and finally having a ttimesink again but since my main game is sc2 I REALLY want to chill while playing classic. I read a lot about this matter and it seems to me that playing Pala is very simple, few spells and not so much room for misplays in PvP. Also, my buddy will go warrior so theres that. Only issue for me is buffing since those 5 min buffs are super not chill. Am I right with this analysis or is there a simpler class to play? Thanks!
---
yes,
---
you are also only capable of getting 1 mining level per node. even if it has 4 clicks. so when you get to thorium and mithril it can be a bit feisty for nodes :P
---
the chad troll priest vs the undead virgin
---
Good thing Blizzard removed all this and replaced every item with +5000 stamina and intellect. OH WAIT!
---
Retards who min/max and take things too seriously or retards who play whichever race they want regardless of optimisation?
---
I'm genuinely unsure which group are supposed to be the retards in your comment.
---
Whoa now. That’s a little scary. I’m catholic
---
Hamsterwheel did a video on it. Go check out his underdogs of raiding
---
Assuming all else is equal: Warriors are better than Rogues in group content (5 people or more), but Rogues are better solo and in small group play.
---
That said, every raid will need a few Rogues to soak up tier pieces, daggers, and other one-handed weapons that the Warriors don't want. Premades will want one Rogue for stealth caps. You just have to beat out the other Rogues to earn a spot.
---
Ooof, sounds like OP struck a n̶e̶r̶d̶ *nerve
---
\*Laughs in lazy rep farming human priest\*
---
I’d be interested in joining man. Just let me know!

Eriador
---
Paladin and Warrior are the two hardest classes to level hands down. 
---
I love grinding. It's like a game in a game, trying to kill efficiently, pull more at a time, less downtime, good rotations, etc.
---
Pushing my kills per hour to the limit is extremely fun. I enjoy it more than running around and doing quests, sometimes.
---
A mix of both is very fun.
---
Well to keep it simple assume it is a flat 3% damage increase in a PvE setting. Does that matter enough to sway what race you intend to play?
---
If I was to be an alliance warrior I would roll NE. Wisp form is a godsencd and surprise charging someone from shadowmeld stealth sounds hilarious.
---
Elemental devastation is more PvE hybrid 1h enhancement or PVP enhancement hybrid, not pvp elemental. Should put the points in eye of the storm. Also in the resto tree, Nature's guidance should be 3/3 because your spells can miss players of equal level by 5%, and it also helps a lot in PvE. The other talents are good enough but I personally like to shorten the Shock cooldown.
---
Source: BiS all 3 specs shaman, playing vanilla for many years.
---
Shit my bad. I clicked the wrong talents. Definitely supposed to be eots
---
I remember I used to have a case of beer with of empty beer cans several empty bottles of crown Royal and a giant Ash tray full of cigarette butts on my desk. From spending 12 plus hours a day on my days off playing world of Warcraft. If I tried drinking that much and smoking that much now, I'd probably die. Age does affect your resilience. 
---
That being said, I do plan on having several rum and cokes while playing this summer. Nothing better.
---
Gadgetzan on the server I played on in original Vanilla had this mage that would pyroblast everyone that landed there in Tanaris. At first, I hated flying to Tanaris due to this guy until much later on when I was full MC gear. One time as I landed he was charging up his pyro, it hit me for 250 (2,500 resisted) and stood there as the guards killed him. I decided to stay there until he gave up trying to kill me before the guards killed him - he ended up /bow and he never attacked me ever again, not even anywhere else in Azeroth. Since then, I never forgot that and even recently when I visited Tanaris that was the first thing that came to mind when I hit lvl 40 and landed there.
---
TL;DR First visit to Tanaris was next STV as far as PvP went. Hated wasting time trying to lvl getting ganked. Came back later in full T1 and made some friends.
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **9th Cakeday** dcrypter! ^(hug)
---
A good chunk of people rolled their characters before there was an established meta at all in vanilla. Had the meta been known at the time there surely would have been more dwarf priests.
---
Fortunately, I was a dwarf priest just b/c dwarves were so fucking cool. Lucked into them being also op.
---
Where the duck are you spells 
---
Exactly don't know why you are being downvoted. I was a priest main and when I was getting group for dungeons I was happy to take a druid along for any role. I remember one time I messed up my healing and the druid hopped out of feral to backup heal. I also remember a few times when the tank would die and the feral would go bear and finish tanking the group. Good druids were great it was just a hard class to master and people are bitter that they couldn't handle the power of nature and anime.
---
/salute to your friend.  
---
Nope. DesMephisto.
---
Definitely a thing for both levelling and pvp. I'm sure you could make it work for 5 man runs or even raids to help speed up things a bit if you wanted to as well.
---
I dunno WoF is pretty sweet, and the extra dot is solid too. I'd give the nod to undead priest for pvp. Shadow guard is killer though, I've gotten a stun off a rogue opening on me... so satisfying
---
First rank is like 50% reduction then it goes down a bit with each rank. The subtlety talents really help.
---
Och, this be Dwarfscrimination, and I willnae stand fer it!

Sorry you haven’t ever excelled at anything you’ve done to the point of pushing your limits while doing it. It’s hilarious how often players like you talk shit about min/maxers simply because you can’t do what they do. 
---
How about you let people play the way they want to? I bet most of them are having way more fun than you, even while min/maxing. 
---
pass the dutchie
---
Timers and trackers make that management pretty easy, but yeah if you don't like the totems I wouldn't roll a shaman, lol.
---
I think I'm planning on going gnome, seems like the wep difference isin't too big of a deal and allows me to PVP more freely. I'll consider human but thanks for the help on deciding. 
---
I rolled dwarf priest in vanilla without knowing jack all about the game. Only learned about fear ward ages later.  
---
I recall a video where 6 Ret paladins judged all 6 ranks of crusader on a boss which in total increased holy damage taken by about 850. Not sure if that will work on classic but if it does you could make smite priest and Ret paladin actually competitive at the cost of 6 debuff slots lol
---
Ah, I forgot that clicking purple guy over brown guy gave you +10 skill and temperment
---
Now that I think about it I feel like being able to have multiple ranks of wisdom or light on a boss would be very op and probably would have been super prevalent if it worked
---
druid
---
I wonder, does blizz retain the rights to those commercials? It'd add some free variety in advertisement if they can just slip those in every now and then
---
Respects top out at 50g in Vanilla. You're not going to be a good tank and healer without respec gold being spent.
---
Why the down ranked totems?
---
Esfand is kind of a noob, but you don't know vanilla if you don't think Monkeynews is a legitimately great warrior even if he does get special perks on private servers. 
---
The second sentence makes it pretty obvious, but the latter group is the one I was referring to. Min/maxing doesn’t mean you take anything seriously, btw. It just means they’re a person who doesn’t settle for mediocrity. I imagine people who roll Night Elf Warrs, Human Mages, Tauren Hunters, etc. are more likely to have overweight girlfriends. 
---
I'd make a video, but it sounds like even more work.
---
Anyone's free to use anything I come up here for their own content tho. Have at it.
---
Lol way to fit the stereotype
---
&gt; It's super braindead; just cast seal, judge, recast seal and alt tab.
---
But that's what this post is all about. You say there's barely any downtime with seal judge seal... math says at certain points exorcism, seal, judge, seal can have -zero- downtime for 9 straight hours. Adding exorcism into the mix adds damage, ranged pull, and faster leveling.
---
U pop it instantly VS a rogue or u die
---
Gotta do SOMETHING with the downtime before launch. Better than bitching about things we don't have any details about yet.
---
Shockadin, Shockadin, Shockadin.
---
If I werr playing a priest, I'd go dwarf, but I think they look cool. Humans are basic af, night elves are meh (and starshards is embarrassingly bad).
---
Still, when I hear ally warriors demand 100%fear ward uptime, all I can think is "stance dance you little bitch" 
---
No one’s forced to do anything. However, if you want to get into a half-decent guild, you should have a reason other than “it looks good” for picking a race. Ex: Rolling a Gnome Warrior. A Gnome Warrior is the worst or second worst for PvE dps and by far the worst for PvE tanking. But, if you say that your main priority is PvP and that’s why you rolled the best race for PvP, they’ll probably assume you’re a good player. 
---
I'm gonna play druid. Resto for raids but I'm completely happy tanking my own dungeons up to and including ubrs. (plus Jindo) 
---
Lol ad hominem in 2019 
---
Paladin hardest to level??
---
&gt;But Mage? I couldn’t be less interested in playing one. You can’t heal, you don’t have a pet and you can’t stealth.
---
Play retail! (sorry, had to)
---
I always thought it was more of a shaman set since you get the Crescent Staff from the main quest. 
---
Probably paladin. Maybe rogue. 
---
&gt; Timers and trackers make that management pretty easy
---
"easy" and "tedious" are not mutually exclusive.

The windmill gave it away instantly.

He got the epic axe aswell. Hes really geared + reckbomb and higher level ofc hes gonna 1 shot a lowbie clothie

For PvE no.

For 1v1 pvp its kinda good with proper gear for some matchups.

Can’t wait for WotLK servers 
---
Fighting what lol posts on the forums? Ffs
---
I've always thought it was a Druid set because all of the bosses in WC are "Druids of the Fang"
---
But you're correct. A shaman could wear that set and get use out of the +2 Staves. So it's not a completely useless bonus.
---
https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07HRVTSY5
---
There's several different designs, some of them are just as cool. It's only $12 but it's actually pretty well made. Big caveat: It took two months to get to from China to midwest USA
---
That's not what I said. Player skill and temperament will always be chosen by a good guild over some racial bonus. If the dwarf priest has more skill, then of course he would get selected.
---
Sorry, we'll be sharded with this many people in one place.
---
Yeah it's not like the dwarf, orc or gnome racial exists to get out of that bleed kite/chain...

-6 expansions

It has never been to max lvl, it skips the previous expansions. Doesn't make it much better, but whats up with twisting facts to suite your narrative better?

We need more posts and content creation about how 1.1 rogues are OP using 10 minutes of cooldowns though, even though 1.1 rogues don't exist in Classic WoW.
---
What's classic is that you actually  bought the textbook. Textbooks are nothing but scams because from my experience. Most of the time we don't even use the textbook. just pay attention to lecture and take notes and you'll be fine
---
I feel you.  I may not have kids, but I can understand being constrained on time to play.  Having done a [REDACTED] server, I found the process excruciating on a warrior.
---
I imagine if your whole goal is the STVietnam that people seem to love so much, then someone short on time could have fun.  If you’re looking for dungeons, professions, and questing but only so-so on world PvP, then it is my feeling that a PvP server would only serve frustration and helplessness in the 1 hour you may have on a given night.
---
PvP players advocate “well just reach out to your guild, local defense, or city chat!  It’s all about the social experience!”
---
That’s all well and good, but you’ll spend your ONE hour to play just looking for a willing lvl 60 to help you clear out the guy 20 levels above you that’s preventing you from farming/leveling/questing.
---
Given an infinite amount of time, I’m sure both of us would love PvP servers, but it is not feasible at this point.  Sorry, speaking for myself, it’s not feasible.  I just imagine it’s not for you either.
---
&gt;  flying mounts, weaker world PvP, separate disconnected world, obsolete everything from old content, arenas, neutral main city
---
Flying mounts: Fine by me. The world was designed to need them.
---
Weaker world PvP: Lots of us play on PvE servers. But there were literally always people at the hot farming spots and daily quest spots, if you couldn't find someone to kill you weren't trying.
---
&gt; separate disconnected world
---
Like I ever went back to Mulgore anyway?
---
&gt; obsolete everything from old content
---
Every new raid tier makes the last tier obsolete. That's how tiers work. But Naxx gear was still equivalent to level 70 pre-raid BiS blues.
---
&gt; arenas
---
Oh no! Someone put skill in my PvP!
---
&gt; neutral main city
---
I am literally unaware of any possible reason this could make a rational person's butt hurt.
---
Shattrath was around before the Horde and Alliance arrived and was ruled by the Scryers, the Aldor and a Naaru, none of whom were taking any shit off the aliens from Azeroth who just showed up. Not every thing in the goddamn universe revolves around Horde vs Alliance squabbling.

Isn’t this comment just essentially an explanation of the meme you posted?

The game will be LITERALLY unplayable without moonwalking.
---
It's actually hilarious how biased this reddit is. Imagine being delusional enough to think ret paladins are bad in Vanilla. The content creators are so full of misinformation and bias to make their classes look weak and others look good. My favorite is them repeatedly implying that 1.1 talent real Vanilla WoW is 1.12 or 1.13 classic where they sell that pom pyro double trinket still works, old rogue normalization, DR or imply locks won't be good or anything when 16 debuffs at launch will put them on par with mages in PVE and 1.12 changes to things like deathcoil make them very strong.
---
&gt; whats up with twisting facts to suite your narrative better?
---
Is this your first time on this subreddit?  
---
I personally take optimal race as some high quality gravy ontop.
---
It works out well for me that I like gnome casters for the rp reasons (ie the physically tiny physique which has compensated with seeking out insane mystic power) the 5% int bonus is just a pleasant bonus.
---
The only credible downside for a gnome caster is another non mechanics reason, the small character models don't show off the gear well enough : D I'd even see this as a legit reason for a different race raider, but id want them to be able to compensate for the conscious choice they made.
---
&gt; everyone was using them
---
You know you can't say that with any ounce of confidence, right? Surely not *everyone* was using them, which is exactly why things like that should remain addons, not features.

Looks like the same actor.

What do I know though. Trusting your eyes makes you "crazy" in a society where 5 media companies own all the media after the Disney Fox merger. Much better to listen to the Ministry of Truth and Propaganda to form all our opinions and tell us what we see and to censor opinions on Rotten Tomatoes and change algorithms on youtube.

The PvP debate gets people more riled up than the classic debate. I haven't seen people pulling out their psych 101 notes from class and list antisocial personality disorder traits and start calling people sociopaths for enjoying classic like they do for those who enjoy pvp, especially ganking or killing quest givers.
---
So what does the based thing mean, I've never understood that. Then again I don't know what pearlclutching, grafting, freeping mean either

For the alliance.

BC had just come out. I was young enough where i couldn't just afford to buy games and WoW committed the worst sin of ALL in my eyes. Not only did i have to buy two games to play, but I had to pay a monthly fee! 
---
One of my friends messages me on MSN and asks me if I have WoW, I tell her I dont and she launches into a tirade that speaks to me on a personal level now that I've played WoW...
---
A few of her friends convinced her to buy WoW, BC, and gametime. So she did and got ready to play only to be met with "okay but reach max level and we'll play" and of course not every friend played on the same faction much less the same server. She asked me if I would buy her WoW account from her but I didn't have any money and I didn't want to pay a sub fee. I ended up trading her some of my PS2 games for her account. I logged in and she had like 7 different character, all on different realms all named the same/similar with accents over the vowels. 4 female lock belfs and 3 night elf druids. None of them passed level 15. Fuck it. I'll just mess around on her characters and see what this game is about. Got upset and didnt understand warlock so I got mad, deleted all of her characters and rolled a Tauren Warrior. Mulgore is still one of my favorite zones even if I can't stand rolling a Tauren anymore. 
---
Ret paladin  logic. Paladins one shotting/stunlocking people with no long cooldowns inside a hammer of justice is fine. 1.1 talent rogue videos blowing 10 minutes of coodowns, where anyone touching the blinded target, including a nearby mob or using skull of impending doom or the swarf racial or being orc that  will ruin the "stunlock" make rogues OP. 
---
All that matters as melee in pvp is burst btw because kiting actually exists in vanilla unlike the modern game. It's why warriors are the best BG class. Ret paladins are one of the strongest wpvp classes. Would never know it with all the misinformation and bias that content people sell to try and make themselves look good.
---
Paladin is slowest to level, not hardest. 
---
That's cherry picking and you know it. That item is for people who have already leveled and are just looking to level again without putting full effort into it. If it healthy for Classic WoW? No of course not, but it's specifically made to hold your hand after you've already done all the "boring" parts. 
---
Oh no, it's retarded. You should post a video of a grand marshal paladin one shotting some rogue with a reck bomb as if it's some standard occurrence with normal gear. That'll help your point. 
---
OP definatly swallowed TRP.

You guys can have a guild. ;)

(All jokes aside, I think dwarves are awesome even if I’ve never rolled one.)
---
&gt;i don't like the design decisions that this game is built around, I hope the demand dries up so they move in a different direction
---
You toxic piece of shit
---
I actually hope they break decurisve. It was always automated play and it trivialized a few raid encounters that were based on the mechanic. Blizzard repeatedly and finally broke it for a reason and it makes some classes glorified bots in PvP like Holy Paladin. Saying decursive is good for the game is like saying a kickbot is good for the game.
---
I'm sure some private server players would argue this, but they also use speedhacks on that old 32 bit easily exploited client and automated downranking with things like their lazyheal mod and scripts that do several things on a button press that didn't work in real vanilla and that autoplay classes for them (warriors especially). They aren't really the best people to ask about what is  automation or exploits.
---
Yes they could and quite easily since you can get in all the dungeon pug groups you want for that sweet, sweet gear to say nothing of guild runs. God dammit it's going to be hard not being a priest as my main. It's that or Pally and I'm planning on doing both BG's and raids. Fucking tough call
---
There were definitely crits. Class with huge burst and awesome gear gets lucky against squishy class with ok gear. Anything else?

LOL too real

I'm interested in joining. NA or EU? You should make a Discord or something.
---
You mean like a ret paladin and a rogue in BIS gear with no crits, no way for the rogue to break the stun since their PvP trinket doesn't remove it and with the paladin having a guaranteed kill because he could have perceptioned a stealth and HOJ'd the rogue and done the same thing?
---

---
The paladin could have done the same thing with the free AV hammer farmed in a week, blue pvp gear farmed by casuals and iron grenading the end of the HOJ for one more round of burst btw. 
---
It's sad that people who play warriors and rogues have to instruct paladins how to play their class. 
---
God damn this sub has some of the best memes around. I'm 43 and I'm diving right into an ocean of those red pills. I'm still trying to figure out how I can run on very little to no sleep like I used to back in the day while somehow still showing up to my great career, lol

Anyone know the defense cap vs mobs the same level as you? (60)
---
...those are words?!? Fuck me I'm getting old
---
Yeah as I plan on healing, I am happily anticipating having native support for mouseover macros
---
Haha the double y hey -&gt; Heyy 🐒. 
---
Well played sir. 
---
So true
---
my favorite race is gnome and i'm gonna be a warlock. Suck on my diiiiick
---
425. Every point of defense reduces chance to be crit by 0.04%. Enemies of equal level have 5% chance to crit, and for every lower or higher the enemy is than the player chance to crit goes down or up by 0.2%, lowering or raising the def requirement to avoid crits entirely by 5 per level. So the raid boss def "cap" is 440 since they are treated as level 63.
---
They weren't crits and Tier 2 is BIS. Thanks for continuing to show how misinformed the Ret Paladin player base is. The only thing worth chasing on PvP gear on a rogue is weapons. Still not worth it imo because Chromatic and Perditions are so close. Warrior is a different story. Warrior sets blow in tier 1/2 compared to PvP gear. The 2 hand sword in tier 2 is just as good/better though.
---
Hey if you need to teach me more about your class let me know. Since Ret Paladins seem to know less than Jon Snow though I am kind of swamped with requests.

Right!?!?! That's what I'm saying!

The gankers usually were from  our rival guilds, not some rogue pvp individuals 
---
Oh wow. I didn't know about that. Fantastic!  
---
The Necropile Raiment set bonus isn't useless. There are so many niche situations in Vanilla WoW, niche builds, niche activities... while some things may be useless there is a lot that goes overlooked, even a decade later.
---
I would understand why people would be apprehensive about revealing their secrets. I certainly do not reveal any of my Vanilla secrets. Think of DM:tribute Hunter solo farming to make +100g an hour. That had been going on long before it was made common knowledge.
---
When thinking of item and build viability, people tend to think of only PvP (or more specifically BGs) and PvE (or more specifically raids). There is so much more.
---
&gt;Imagine leaving your hunter logged out on a hill where you know many valuable herbs spawn nearby.
---
Imagine leaving your multiboxed or alt tauren druid logged out directly on the black lotus node with a timer on the respawn and you get the same node every time for a week.
---
&gt;but they lack such an easy way to prevent mobs from hitting them while they try to gather from nodes
---
Hibernate, natures grasp, limited invulnerability pots.
---
Enhance Shaman/Ret Pally and Hunters will want the helm for when they hit 40.  Shaman/Pally may also want Ravager and Scarlet pants.
---
Not sure if trolling or truly an asshat...
---
You typically see Trolls in PvE for Berserker. You can stack Berserker with trinkets for insane damage spikes when appropriate (threat wise).
---
Staying under both tanks on Hakkar will once again wipe so many raids.
---
I played WoW back in the day, took me till Cata to finally level cap (altaholic, grind just got too slow after \~40).
---
In BfA now I have 3 level 120's and lots more alts in the 60-90 range. With my very little playtime I can still feel I'm getting somewhere.

I'll try Classic, I'm sure I'll have some nostalgic moments, but doubt I'll level cap.
---
I’m the same way, but my brain allows me one bank alt for some reason. 
---
Only max rank Lightning Shield. Needs moar buttons. 
---
This is wrong. The two piece set bonus (+20 stam) is arguably BiS in vanilla (PvP). CTS and Perdition's are absolutely significantly worse than r14 weps. The DPS is "close" but r14 sword is 2.9 compared to CTS 2.6. Meanwhile the r14 dagger is 2.0 and perd is 1.8. Yes I know attacks were normalized, that doesn't change slow being better for mainhand. 
---
https://imgur.com/v97AwK0 his addons let you see the crits too
---
I'm personally not worried about reckbomb in classic, sit macros almost certainly won't work and [certain forms of CC should remove stacks if classic is 1:1.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm) 
---
&gt; Why didn't my Reckoning bomb go off?
---
The following things can cause you to drop your charges:
---
&gt; * Ending a Duel
---
&gt; * Mounting up (including gryphons)
---
&gt; * Autoattacking too early (e.g. from out of range)
---
&gt; * Switching Continents
---
&gt; * Switching Weapons
---
&gt; * **Losing control of your character** (Fear, Scattershot, **Blind**, Polymorph, Mind Control, etc.) 
---
R1 Magma for rogue tagging, same with Stoneclaw, R1 Searing to be annoying. Read somewhere it gave spell pushback think that was a different server. 
---
Silence is only cleared by magic dispels and a paladin's bubble. Resto/purification pots can also do it (purification pots can also clear CoT, but it can be immediately reapplied).
---
I never made it to 60 :(
---
You make that joke but for me you better watch your tongue if you're alliance because I may just be critting you on my warrior as i get buffed and healed by my girl
---
Just roll female human for the great animations
---
Took me just over 8 months to 60 with about 15 days /played
---
I’m honestly having a really hard time choosing what I want to do. Are there any experienced hunters and priests out there? I’m trying to decide between healing like I have been doing since wotlk and going dps. The hunter seems fun with how pets function and dps rotations while on priest I would be done specifically healing. Any advice from anyone would be appreciated I’m really curious about how end game feels for both.
---
Yeah like that. 
---
My favourite starting area 🙂
---
Never got alliance chat over 30, never will. It’s always horde bud!
---
Weapon speed was also normalized in 1.8. It's why Barman Shanker isn't = AQ level weapons in 1.12 like it was in 1.1, which was frankly broken. Rogues were op in 1.1 and so were mages. Classic ain't 1.1 You are looking at a tiny fraction of damage in PVP especially when BG's appear to be delayed until tier 2 in Classic. You can pick up the Chromatic for minimal time investment in a nerfed raid due to debuffs, talents, and DM gear and itemization. Yeah the rank 14 weps will still be AWESOME for PVE but there is really no point. Tier 2 is so nerfed who cares and in AQ a lot of PVP gear gets replaced anyways. 
---
Also BIS for all of vanilla? Might want to look at the set bonus on AQ gear. It's why I wouldn't even bother doing Naxx on a rogue. I would instead use a mage alt on another account and solo farm the Misplaced Servo Arm. Rank 14 is also a complete waste of time due to a little more stam when Tier 2 has way more agility/dodge. If you farm the whole set which would still be like 1/50th the time investment of rank 14 you get a heal proc to. 
---
You paladins are funny. :)
---
Yup going horde :-)
---
On pservers people sometimes skip all of STVietnam, because it's a war zone. That is the pinnacle of lvl 30-40 leveling, and even those people manage to find enough quest in other zones. They have to travel a lot, but that level range really is no problem.
---
in old vanilla, the levels above 55 were a real issue, in the beginning of the game when quests in several endzones were not fully developed yet.  (no silithus, not much in the plaguelands etc)
---
Especially a dwarf. 
---
12 years a healer here. Reading this thread made me want to do the same thing as you. 
---
I liked the social aspect of WoW, and as a tank I'd always have a group to play with.
---
&gt; On the other hand you have people who preach how important a solid community is while simultaneously attempting to gatekeep that community and push away "the wrong sort of people".
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It's quite bizarre.
---
How is that bizarre? Any community based on a certain ideal, like the Boy Scouts of America, Churches, hobby clubs, they are all centered around a common ideal, a common goal and common understanding.
---
You don't want people who hate boats to join the regatta. You don't want people who won't follow the rules and think dice are stupid to join the Dungeons and Dragons session.
---
For the same reason, authentic fans of Vanilla WoW are weary of the, indeed, *wrong sort of person* damaging the community.
---
Just wait for the deluge of "Classic sucks, it needs portals, lvl 60 takes too long need boosts" etc etc posts to be unleashed onto the official forums after release.
---
In real vanilla I was 100% fine healing in shadow spec until around Sunken Temple. Around that point it started to get difficult to keep everyone alive if anyone made mistakes.
---
With a good team I think you'd be fine all the way to sixty, but with randoms and bad tanks and it could be worth respeccing in the mid to late fifties.
---
I did almost everything underlevelled too - priests were in such high demand for dungeon runs that I saw almost everything a couple of levels earlier than I would have on a DPS toon. It was still fine.
---
Whether or not something miraculous happens, we're still all gonna be there for it. I'm happy for that
---
Lol dude the games so far gone the only option is to start over with a classic WoW, to perhaps maybe prove what got blizzard success in the first place in hopes of an actual future for WoW. Even then retail will never be good short of just wiping all the b.s. they added to it and completely remodeling the world of azeroth and beyond.
---
They went wrong. WoW was loved for the world it created and brought to life. Warcraft had the unique lore as groundwork. That world got killed in exchange for mindless grinding with pay to win, conveince, catering to non rpg playing babies, and generally not accepting that yes it was technically a theme park style mmorpg but it had heavy sandbox elements in game play and fluent interaction. They failed to cater to them sandbox elements and expand thus expanding the world and instead nurtured the theme park elements already established (no reason to make shit more directed and accessible beyond bug fixes,balancing classes,more raids,etc). They knew damn well it was erasing the rpg elements. It's basic game design knowledge to know increased movement beyond some fast travel options and mounts (like hovering in the damn air) will kill the immersion and vastness feeling of the world... the witcher people and rd2 people knew this. Rd2 is smaller than gta5 but no car or air vehicles means it feels vast and immersed. It's basic shit. They sacrificed the rpg for the masses because a million something dollars wasn't enough. Rpgs aren't popular for the same reason books aren't anymore. Do the math.
---
The only hopes for mmorpgs after WoW classic is basically WoW erasing all the mistakes of retail and oliberating the game as we know it, or some small developer doesn't make vaporware and hits that actual successful sweet spot. Classic WoW is legit the real battle for azeroth. Let's make that shit outshine this dungeon crawler spin-off of world of Warcraft and bring it to its knees
---
&gt;On the other hand you have people who preach how important a solid community is while simultaneously attempting to gatekeep that community and push away "the wrong sort of people".
---
What don't you understand about this attitude? Not whether it's right or wrong, but do you not see the reasoning? 
---
So in what niche is this useful?
---
Rogues farm better alone. Warriors you do jump runs with a healer. Both are completely viable. I would say if you are more social play warrior. Like to do quite a bit alone in between raids play a rogue. On a PVE server getting a raid spot on a rogue should be pretty easy.
---
Reasons outside that you could argue for class fantasy. Rogues are just really cool in vanilla. I play a warrior over a rogue now on private but the class fantasy of a rogue in vanilla is just brilliant. The poisons, farming the blinding powder, pickpocketing. 
---
I remember my first LAN party it wasn’t big by any means there were just 4 of us 
---
We had music on in the background , a well stocked fridge and pizza 
---
But it was just so amazing to be able to ask someone , “hey lets go do this quest together , or let’s go explore what’s over here” 
---
Headsets are cool and all but it doesn’t beat having people around you that actually just wanna have fun and asking “who needs this gear?” 
---
Now everyone is so concerned with getting ahead and trying to One up on each other , I miss it I really do 
---
There were 3 crits, come on now.
---
You can hear the human crit sound, the undead "receiving a crit" sound and see the numbers not flowing upwards but staying still and not moving.
---
His health goes from 4433 to 753 (600 if you count the Shadow Oil proc) in 1 swing. This means: 
---
* 3 crits for 750-800 dmg each 
---
* 2 regular swings for ~400 damage each
---
* Seal of Command proc for 460 damage
---
* Shadow Oil proccing (you can see it bring his health from 753 to 600)
---
Gonna ignore the SoC Judgement since that finished him off.
---
Thanks for info :)
---
Hardest to obtain is Ironfoe for sure. I know some people went 100+ (some even 500+ lol) BRD runs without getting one.
---
No clue about what else you'd use since I've never really played prot.
---
Aren't there addons for that?
---
Wow that first point totally wasn't brought up by myself. I said nothing of rogues outside of gearing. I agree they're overrated and not close to early vanilla rogues. I agree ranking isn't worth the time but saying CTS is "close" to R14 is just wrong. I wouldn't rank myself, I don't think the time investment is worth it. None of that changes the fact that you were wrong about the points I actually said were wrong. There is a **30 stam** difference between **T3** gloves/boots and PVP gloves/boots.
---
*You* might want to take a look at the AQ gear bonuses. You'll notice evis is 5/5 and the pvp +20 stam bonus is 2/6. There are 8 pieces in most sets. You can have both at the same time. Besides I would prefer T3 over T2.5, the extra energy and stats is too valuable. 
---
I play rogue and paladin, and I'm sure as hell not ret.
---
Hunter, Warlock, Druid, Paladin. All of these are as easy as it gets.
---
Uhh pretty sure you want freedom on the warrior, not the hunter. It's not like the hunter cares about being slowed in the first place. The warrior though...
---
It's complicated and depends on a lot of factors. Windfury. Weapon skill racials. Raid boss or dungeons. Threat vs mitigation.
---
Either way here are some good options:
---
[Ironfoe](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11684) for anyone dedicated enough to get it with its 2% drop rate.
---
[Bone Slicing Hatchet](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18737). Agility is a great dual purpose threat/mitigation stat and stamina is nice too.
---
[Timeworn Mace](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18376). Good defensive weapon for humans with mace skill.
---
War/hpal/mage would be pretty solid and cover each other's weaknesses.
---
Pally is weak af to curse of tongues but mage can take care of that. Warrior is weak to slows but pallies are obviously good at popping freedom on them.
---
Outside of that, 3 geared elemental shamans would be fun to see (but not to play against).
---
Absolutely, I'd say gnomes are THE best warrior class for PvP on alliance, no doubt. 
---
Probably but you know one less addon lol and not every one would have it so less people that are actively RPing.
---
This is the problem with StarCraft2 and DOTA2, I hope we'll be a different community in wow classic and not choice shame players.
---
Strength and honor, may the wind be at your back, and all that good stuff then my man.
---
&gt; His videos basically consists of him killing undergeared people. 
---
??? 
---
Last I checked the only times that happened was when he was 1v3 or that time he was 1v5. Or if you want to count that time he was ranking in blues and killed 1v2 a r14 and a guy in shit gear. I mean he technically killed a guy with worse gear than him.
---
I get that you're hating on the guy but come on lol
---
Are you really pimping another keypress inside an unbreakable stun as skill?  As I said you could secure it with a iron grenade, sapper charge or use the charge to reveal the vanish and if dwarf you can immune the blind and on and on. It's a harder counter than mage warrior. Consumables make that winnable. 
---
My points is not that "ret paladins are overpowered" I am pointing out that they are hypocrites. Bias by certain content creators is laughable. Ret Paladins have 2 of the strongest hard counters in the game. They dumpster warrior/rogue in a 1 v 1 and they can do it with much less skill in the matchup, unlike other hard counters. It's why people play ret in the first place. Then they cry that the utility they have and cheesy mechanics that let them beat those two classes without having to try, which means they HAVE to do less sustained in a raid or they would make other classes pointless make them "bad". 
---
Ret Paladins are one of the easiest options in vanilla to do well in pvp. They are strong out of the gate with an arcanite reaper. They get a minimal effort 2 hander in AV, the blue pvp set is fine until like AQ when pvp goes down the crapper and gets bad anyways, which is why everyone rerolls to F R E S H at the end of AQ. 
---
You don't even have to raid on a ret to compete in pvp. Same with enhance. They are not "broken OP" like the ret paladin community tries to spin other classes are, but the idea that they are victims or need buffs, which ONLY ret paladins seem to ask for all the time is a joke.
---
The thing is that Blizzard has not done anything like that for RP servers in the past 15+ years for retail afaik. Why would they start now, and why would they even do it for Classic out of all places?
---
I wish you peace in the loss of your friend. I lost a good friend as well, that I met in WoW. We were friends for almost 6 years before he died. The pain is true, and agonizing. I'm sorry.
---
Thank you for doing what you love, and doing something to remember him by.
---
Yikes imagine being a classic pvp "elitist" before the game is even out. You can rant about arena all you want, it wasn't a thing in Vanilla and won't be a thing in Classic. This isn't about 2v2 or 3v3.
---
Playing a male night elf?
---
Lol.
---
Yeah, pretty hilarious listening to people defend the "difficulty" of vanilla too. "those idiot retail players could NEVER learn to play the archaic skeletal version of the game they play now" 
---
druids dont have much to CC mobs so you listed something hunters can do too
---
Yup same here. and my RP aspect of it - the two were best mates since forever. one of them got serious health issues (teenage hunting accident why not).
---
one goes on adventures to support both, other stays and provides all the help he can.
---
Are you even replying to the right person? I'm calling you out on saying that there were no crits while there were obviously 3 of them.
---
Get over yourself, ret paladins are a joke and you're making a fool out of yourself crying about them. And it's not reckbomb will work like it does in pservers atm anyways. Holy shit dude you're copypasta material.
---
That's not something I will discuss publicly.
---
That's just human nature, mate. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the internet.
---
I'll take a drunk half midget with an attitude over a pretty boy in a dress that probably watches Real Housewives any day of the week.
---
If you play a Night Elf Priest I dont necessarily think you're gay, but I know you're gayer than me.
---
As far as we know, Classic will use the Legion API. Anything that isn't possible with it won't be possible in Classic. The 1 button power-shifting macro is one example.
---
As wonderful as this tribute is, do be careful. Loss is hard to process and you may delve into WoW as a crutch a bit too much causing issues IRL which I’m sure your buddy wouldn’t want. Plus playing his classes on classic without him will probably be very hard as levelling is a long process leaving your mind to ponder. 
---
Be careful man and god speed, sorry for your loss. 
---
And less dmg and less dodge. Rogues do their dmg in bursts. Rank 14 is a waste of time on a rogue. I have never met one good rogue outside one private server who ranked since nost. He was also human which is a bad choice. He rerolled to warrior on the next private. Most good rogues will only rank in Classic due to trying to build a streaming career. There is also a lot less carrot on a stick compared to private in Classic where you get stupidly good gear out of the gate, while in Classic that is delayed until BWL. I think that is a good change though to replicate what we had in WPVP.
---
So you play Holy? Good man.  Question for you, do you think decursive should be broken? I am almost always Horde and most seem split on it. Paladins have cleanse as such a big part of their utility I think it's a interesting question. 
---
You need to play both to find your niche. I feel Undead is more "all in" whereas Troll adds a bit of "finesse"
---
Osrs is better than retail wow. 
---
The raider promotion after the breakup is real asf.
---
Eranikus is a massive pain in the ass in an appropriately levelled ST group. Not being able to dispel his sleep is just such a pain.
---
I wonder if it worked like that in retail vanilla.
---
As a warrior on vanilla servers I always wanted mages in my 5 mans. They were so useful in so many situations. 
---
I used to LAN with another dude (miss you Brennan) that also played a Human Rogue. We utterly dominated the 2v2 bracket, and ran double Rogue + Warlock in 3s to similar success.
---
Perception is already a fairly powerful racial, but when the meta is full of Druids stealthing in Cat to open the match it was game breaking.
---
Bullshit legends 
---
Lmao @ overweight girlfriends 
---
No. 
---
I plan on playing about the same amount per day, that I played per week during vanilla.
---
Let's see how quickly I burn out...
---
I think my server-leading (lol) guild managed to kill Razuvious and Patchwerk. We also never managed to down C'thun. Mostly due to carrying so many scrubs. 
---
Honestly, I was pretty scrubby myself, and I was easily one of the better members of the guild.
---
May your hand arthritis not ache and your chair be soft. 
---
Rets are one of the strongest 1 v 1 classes and always were in vanilla with engineering/trinkets and consumables. Good players are just bored on them and no really good player can stand playing them.  They are also great in PUG BG's especially if they use their utility which none do because the ret playerbase is possibly the worst played class in the history of MMO's. Have Esfand play a rogue and stream it. He likes to talk about how he could play a rogue now. Better yet how about a warrior. He likes to brag about how he only lost to Monkeynews due to having the wrong spec and MN using consumables. He fails to mention it's because rets are a complete hard counter and could be played in that match up with a Poodle controlling the class. Yet he still wants to play victim status and cry about rets when it suits his need and spin other classes and overpowered or super strong. My favorite was when he said a rogue should beat a ret paladin. Biggest lie I have ever heard.
---
Esfand and Monkeynews as PvP players is like comparing Michael Jordan to Peter Dinklage as a basketball player, yet the class is so imbalanced in some matchups that it's an autowin.
---
Have fun with the content creator bias and BS.
---
Not true. Unlike night elf troll has a racial that syncs with shadow weaving that benefits the pvp aspect. So with this it makes trolls secretly op in pvp and best in slot for pve
---
Unless they've changed something I haven't seen and you still want to be a pally, then Indeed it will be alliance for you 
---
I play for pvp and for me that’s the most optimal race or the most efficient to have an edge on my opponent. 
---
Many of the ZG set bonuses were plain awful and felt designed by someone that didn't play the game or figured ZG set bonuses probably shouldn't exist but decided to throw people a bone at the last second or something.
---
Hilarious how many downvotes this is getting to protect a certain content creator, while any stupid meme pushing 1.12 rogues as broken and op is upvoted to the top of the reddit. What a joke this community has become. So much bias and BS. They also think warlocks are somehow bad when Classic will start with 16 debuffs and locks will = mage dmg right off the bat.
---
Keep misiniforming people Classicast. Locks and Paladins are oppressed victims and bad classes and everyone else is op. Pretty soon we will have the other guy who didn't clear a raid until WOTLK talk about how bad warriors are to.
---
Nice video thanks for posting it. Was too much for us. The raw individual responsibility in such a long fight kept us from finishing this one. It was so hard to keep everyone on their toes and attentive for such an extended period back then.
---
Thanks guys
---
Thank you  
---
Combined with my current employment and off-work activities, the butt-to-chair and mouse activity will remain similar...
---
The only thing I have to get better at: drink more water.
---
One guy in awful gear, other guy in BIS AQ/Naxx. Warrior also uses consumables and barely wins, while Esfand is the wrong spec. MN is a stupidly better player than Esfand who would be mediocre to bad on a warrior or rogue. All this video does is show how brokenly OP Rets can be in certain 1 v 1's and stresses the fact that people who claim they are bad are delusional and need of psychiatric help. BTW get Esfand on tape saying he is in Monkeynew's league as a player. He will never say it because he would be called out by the entire classic community outside Classicast.
---
No thank you. I don't want to read about how you're a half Human half Night Elf which Jaina has a crush on.
---
Different, namely more difficult. Perhaps this is a good thing, as many people have been crying for increased HP values for bosses. Maybe they're in for a surprise when everyone is dying for not being auto buffed, auto healed, and auto decursed.
---
Warriors and raiding healers will be interesting in real classic. A lot of "good" private server warriors are using scripts to automate things on warriors by automatically using execute and overpower. Same with tanking. On healers they have a addon to auto downrank heals. Wonder how many of these "legends" will fall.
---
MN is decent though and streams so you know he is legit and not just a script kid. Rogue is also kind of a joke now outside the "combat" spec. Warrior lost of a lot of the skill component past WOTLK. Rogues were more difficult in Cata/MoP than vanilla but are less difficult now in most comps. 
---
**Arena is not really a good display of skill past WoD.**
---
Yeah you do lose damage with the 2pc, I said "arguably bis". For the situations where you wouldn't need the stam you would wear full T3. 
---
I'm down with breaking decursive, though I don't mind if they keep it working. I think it would be great for PvP, and let better players shine more.
---
As a high end pserver player, I 100% support breaking decurse and other addons.
---
It's ironic that some few pserver players will complain about Vanilla being "too easy" and advocate for HP and damage value changes for raids,
---
but are against legitimate difficulty increases like no stance dance macros or no auto decurse.
---
Even something as "easy" as MC will be far harder without decursive addon. Backpedaling Mages WILL miss the decurse and people will die because of it. It'll be far harder.
---
I think that race dichotomy applies better to mages than priests.  Troll priest is actually PvE and PvP BIS 
---
You’re right but most people don’t know that. Shadowguard is stealth OP. 
---
Yes, you would be flagged.  Furthermore, if you're not flagged and you heal or buff someone who is flagged, that would flag you as well.  
---
Yeah that is what I am thinking. If I was a Holy Paladin I would want my strength to be skill based. The really good Holy Paladins would REALLY shine if they break decursive. Just like how the good priests shine with offensive dispels. 
---
Lol ok when I played vanilla the best warrior in PvP on the horde was a tauren and for an alliance a human. Now they say orcs are good the most optimal PvP race. How was the less optimal race able to 1v3 people? 
---
Mained a Rogue on Elysium and Warrior on K2, completing all relevant content up to AQ.  
---
Rogue does comparable PVE DPS to fury warrior, depends on how good/shit your tank is. Has way fewer aggro problems, but has a lower max dps overall. Also has horrific pre-bis gearing experience and a ton of competition for groups that warriors don't have.  
---
Warrior PvP experience is pretty crap if you don't have pocket healers, okay if you do. Bearing in mind that it is unequivocally the worst 1v1 class in the game and Rogue is arguably the best. Rogues are insanely enjoyable if you're good and do just fine in most PvP environments, but while they're amazing in world PvP and small skirmishes, there are better classes if you plan on pubbing BGs all day.  
---
Finally, if you plan on PvPing while progressing content, rogues remain relevant as long as your gear is remotely close to the raid tier the server is up to and warriors... don't. PVPing with a warrior and rogue in MC purples when AQ is out is night and day.
---
This is a solid explanation of the rotation of a 5th level rogue.
---
Wut?
---
Mage with Ignite like 7-8k DPS
---
Warrior Fury for like 3k-4k DPS for short fights/2.2-2.4k for long fights
---
Rogue 1900 DPS
---
Warlock 1800 DPS
---
Sure, but you’re still not explaining it. Why shouldn’t people be excited about classic wow under classic wow subreddit? Makes sense to me.
---
You lost it. I created tons of characters at like level 3-6 before one race even stuck with me Back in 05
---
Decurse ? Nah, its the healing druid job. I'm too busy doing my complicated rotation !
---
Im glad you mentioned those 3 because they are perfect for a hardcore player as they shine the most in skilled hands. Honestly you cant go wrong with either of those, they all top the meters and you need a lot of them in raids, so the demand is great as well. The biggest difference imo is the utility and usefulness for others. Warriors can tank, mages got water and portals, but rogue doesnt really have any of that and you could feel left out at times with him. I think rogue is actually pretty boring in premade PvP because you either defend the flag, or you defend the base. Both warriors and mages are in action smashing everything they see, so thats a plus. Maybe you should dodge the mage if you dont like a boring pve rotation, but I never personally found it to be something that would bother me. I would still recommend warrior though as he feels the most rewarding. If you dont mind grinding and tough leveling experience (its actually not so bad if you do it correctly), go for the warrior. But yeah you cant go wrong with any of those classes :D
---
wont the keyboard cover the nice parts of the pic?
---
These are so good!
---
See kids? Don't marry or else you're gonna end up like that!
---
Everyone that doesn't speak german or french will play english servers. 
---
I will for sure. There will surely be no server for my language, and even if i'll still prefer playing on a server with a diverse population, as you've stated. 
---
Inspirational story. Give this man a medal.
---
Sorry but if you're alliance and not dwarf I see you as a 12 year old or a noob. Fear Ward is incredible. Oh and dwarves are the best alliance race lore and looks wise anyways.
---
Few variants and some preference. This is what you do when you are trying to raid/pvp with the same spec in a middle progress guild in a melee group. It's good enough with chainheal and totems to get by until AQ and can save you a lot of cash. Stick with raiding though because a lot of the best ele gear is in AQ. Don't play ele if you don't want to raid.
---

---
This is the 1 v 1 spec and it's good in bg's to. It's what people usually run because shamans don't bother ranking high as their is no Elemental PvP set. Why mana talents over everything else? Cus mana is Ele's weakness, much like a shadow priest. Why improved fire nova totems? Because you can do some interesting combos with a iron grenade and tauren warstomp that makes things all land close to the same time.
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo)
---
This is the premade spec where your guaranteed burst is more important than a heal. Ele is very good in a premade, it's just people don't want to waste their time ranking something that doesn't matter.

I plan on infiltrating a min/max guild with my warrior and manipulating my way to the top to gear up for the eventual creation of my PvP guild.

Seriously pvpers are more laid back I hate that it became less dominant in game instead of a deciding factor of the world itself not just character progression. I remember being in a PvP guild that was so op they could kill it in raids briefly just to gear up and wreck people. They were the only guild that said "dude you can tank as arms come along". Most hardcore raiders would quit the bgs when our groups joined or get strategically owned. 
---
If I recall correctly it totally did.
---
Accepted wisdom at the time was "this is the fight that teaches you that sometimes you need to do a tank swap". Also known as "this is the time the game lets you get all the way to the very end of the dungeon before fucking you because you didn't know to bring an off-tank".
---
I healed as Shadow all the way through 60, encompassing numerous ST / BRD runs and zergs through Scholo and Strat. TBH it actually really helps you fine tune your rotation and learn mana efficiency. I did err on the side of caution and try to run instances on the higher side of the level range rather than the lower (excepting Ulda, which I healed as shadow at 38...).
---
Once you hit 60 definitely switch to Holy; not only will it make 5-manning trickier instances like Strat live and 5-man Scholo possible in blues/greens, but if you spec into Holy Nova you can farm DME lashers, which is how I bought my epic mount and all my BoE purples.
---
If you plan on staying Shadow at 60 you'll have your work cut out for you, but it's possible. You might still need to pick up +heal gear and try to convince warlocks/casters that you need to role on "their" items.
---
6... Just haven't muscled the silver for gouge yet. 
---
Spell pushback from Searing Totem when you fight certain casters + Magma Totem to break Rogues out of stealth. Elemental Shaman will basically never die as long as they have mana, but every spell they have aside from Lightning Bolt burns their mana extremely quickly. Downranking is the only way to use your utility spells without destroying your mana pool.
---
u/Tangerinefox is right about Rank 1 Stoneclaw Totem. You can bind that instead of Rank 1 Fire Nova - but still keep max rank Fire Nova bound for when you need extra burst damage.
---
The dab pen at the end &lt;3

What will be the most in-demand class?
---
Gnome is the caster bis race on alliance
---
Ill take a look through them and see if i can find equivalents supplied to the UK cheers.
---
You dont actually run out of quests at 30-40, there's plenty. That problem comes around lvl50+
---
hilarious
---
I am going to have three accounts minimum due to having two kids that will also be playing. I am not really into multi boxing and there will be many hours a day where the kids are at school and I can play the ah while still out grinding or running dungeons 
---
Or in other words, it's completely useless but I want to look smart. Hell no, there is no way +3 defense for a cloth user is ever good. If you prove to me it is, I'll owe you 500g in classic.
---
&gt;Also known as "this is the time the game lets you get all the way to the very end of the dungeon before fucking you because you didn't know to bring an off-tank".
---
Hahaha.
---
I wasn't trawling through your old posts looking for something to hold over you, I quickly checked to see if you were this obnoxious in every discussion you entered into.
---
Would you like me to post dps meters from my other rogue I'm levelling which also demonstrates the minimal 5-7% dps advantage of combat over hemo? Sorry you didn't like being disagreed with over your "don't ever level as hemo, it will take 20 days" comments, but my experiences really show otherwise. 
---
I agree with the nelf's jaw line!
---
Literally everyone else that can speak english will roll on those, dont worry about it
---
Full t2 is also terrible overall, I would rather have a mishmash of gear.
---
This is one of the reasons I loved classic.
---
40 people from all over the EU (and some from other countries) all coming together, working together, making friends.
---
I also love joining a group for a dungeon, asking where people were from and everyone was from a different country, Just awesome.
---
I still talk to some guys from all them years ago from Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Ireland.
---
more diversity the better i'd say, come on over!
---
AWESOME!       
---
Rogue. My original hated for them has lasted since my first vanilla experience. None of my attempts to level them has succeeded and I die of boredom each time. 
---
look at his username. it becomes clear.
---
Warlock: 
---
I like to watch people run around in fear whilst i loot a black lotus.
---
Shhhh!! Don't tell!
---
Warrior is a new passion for me from the last few years of private servers. I like the action and strategy, although I may not be great at it. I'll roll a warrior 3rd so I can save gear and mats.
---
Yeah people sucked in vanilla. Those sweet montages of mages keyboard turning and clicking spells oh man...    
---
private servers changed a lot, and while it’s true that quite a few casuals are gonna return for classic, the overall community is going to be a lot more skilled/min-max
---
Night Elf Warriors are actually pretty good tanks. They get passive Dodge bonus and highest base agi in game.
---
Do they have classic models and animations? Couldn't find it
---
It really isn’t that bad. 
---
As for elites, it’s very few that are poison immune.
---
Those numbers don’t add up for me. So I don’t think that works.
---
Night Elf Warriors are BiS tanks, but tanks don’f have time for girlfriends anyway
---
Femalre tauren druid needs to be the middle aged women coming from Stardew Valley!
---
I fell in love with Hunter when I played survival spec in pvp. It feels absolutely brutal to control other players to that degree. I've been wanting too reroll one ever since
---
fuck you.
---
I like to pvp, even more world pvp than bgs because we all know that pvp for druids is almost reduced as flag carrier in wsg 
---
&gt;locks will = mage dmg right off the bat
---
If you think that debuff slots are the reason why locks are doing dogshit DPS early on tells pretty much enough about your knowledge about the game.
---
And for a "I just hit 60," nothing good on the auction house, 100% guaranteed, solo obtainable starting weapon, I'd recommend the Western Plaguelands cauldron quest line that culminates with this:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=15800
---
(The same quest even rewards a similarly acceptable starting neck item)
---
Well unless you are actually playing a healer in PvP in which case I don't think you would say the same.
---
Yes, I also go in blind. Like your stile man. GL with the Druid.
---
&gt;rouge's
---
Why would face powder need gear? :p
---
I hated the contested territories. Playing on a PVE server &amp; still getting PK'd while trying to level by max level chars when I was in the 30s was just straight up not fun. For that reason, I have awful memories of zones like Stranglethorn. 
---
Grinding by itself isn't so bad. Put on some music &amp; just veg out while killing zebras or whatever. I'm not as fond of the running back-and-forth quests, but the ones where you're just in one spot collecting stuff, which the Barrens has an abundance of, aren't so bad.
---
I also used to do that with fishing. 
---
The AQ set for hunters decreases the cost of arcane shot. But arcane shot shares a cooldown with Aimed Shot, which is superior in raiding.
---
cool. but maybe have a read through the tos first. 
---
Perfectly within the rules
---
From my (limited) experience as MT back in vanilla content I stance danced anyway because I dont trust them to actually do their job and I would rather take that extra fraction of damage than get feared because "oops I forgot".
---
Thanks for the info.
---
If I manage to get to 55+ I'l respec to Holy for sure, never did level cap back in the day, we'll see :)
---
I'll join. Your situation is identical to mine.i want to play like old times but none of the old friends are coming back. I'm big on leveling and dungeons, but not raids. If we all coordinate a server nearer release, I'd be in
---
Alcor’s sunrazoe bor world drop epic.
---
I think beckon put out a smite pvp video back in vanilla. 
---
PvP. End of discussion. Has it's hard times, but it's the REAL classic experience
---
Absolute nonsense. 
---
I don't have much experience with priest, but I've leveled a paladin to 60 on ND and I'd say they're the easiest healer for a beginner. They have only 2 heals, very mana efficient due to crits refunding 100% of mana. I think with priests you have to be much more mindful of the 5 second rule and not spam healing, on pally you just spam as much as you want without a care in the world.
---
you read em in less than 60 seconds? read them then get back to me. 
---
Please inform me what I missed?  I am not breaking any rules having multiple active accounts and playing the game
---
Downvotes are most likely from your attitude, but that's just my opinion.
---
Fucking ninja! 
---
Prince of Darkness
---
Thanks. I feel that im gonna have great fun, once i get to cat. Then well see where my talents go and what ill do. be it chicken, healing or ripping enemies to shreads.
---
Does AoE grinding work without dynamic respawn or will that not matter at all?
---
Frost is superior to fire until this video reminds you of PoM Pyro glory
---
Signs aliens HATE it.
---
Multiboxing and having multiple accounts are within the terms of service. Sharing an accounts with your child as well. 
---
Tirisfal, Silver pine, Stv, Hillsbrad
---
Stv is the best
---
Shit my man, I'm between jobs and exclusively looking for work that is weekends only.
---
And there's my retail friends I raided with for about 5 years. Except one they say they don't want to play Classic because "graphics are bad and game is boring, you will return to retail after 2 weeks". Most of them started WoW post Cata so yeah, there's definetly many of those people who simply can't grasp the concept of some people like the older game more than the modern iteration.
---
This is an extremely rare situation with a character that has extremely good gear. It in no way reflects the average interaction between rogues and paladins.
---
Also payo is shit so this is funny af.
---
Let's hope so ;-)
---
&gt; I'm genuinely unsure which group are supposed to be the retards in your comment.
---
People who care more about irrelevant attributes of their character than other peoples time.
---
i rather have macros than trying to remember where my skills are. WoW have so many skills to use that it is inconvenient and I dont want my whole keyboard to be bind to skills. It is stupid. When playing frost mage I have my water pets skills bind to my own skills so I can spam skill and use my pets skill to control people at the same time
---
My first raid boss kill in Vanilla was c'thun, my second was 4 horseman.. Came into a raiding guild in full hwl gear because I had friends that were guild leaders. I remember leaving that Naxx with Necro Knights Garb, later a wraith blade. PvE never seemed difficult when you start at the hardest tier with non idiots.
---
Warlocks, mages, hunters, rogues all have their own advantages with herbing.
---
You missed out one of the big advantages of a hunter: You can aggro mobs and feign death them onto other herbers. 
---
Funny enough those were my two mains during vanilla (dwarf hunter, undead priest) and did up to AQ40 on both and Naxx on priest. 
---
 My personal opinion on priest is if you are one and you like healing tanks then you should probably go Horde because paladins take over a lot of the tank healing on alliance.  The downside is this means you will also be the only class capable of dispelling some magic effects so fights like Chromaggus may suck(especially if decursive or other automated tools are removed).  In PvP this means you also take a more defensive role since shamans can offensively purge you are the de facto PvP healer/warrior heal bot.  Leveling was easy and that was the only time I went shadow which was nice for the time but not something I wanted to do long term.
---
For hunter it is the class I started in beta and then finished vanilla with and played it throughout TBC.  Leveling is great, PvP is great both world and BGs(honestly I think they are underrated in the forums for this aspect), and PvE is so-so.  During vanilla I didn't care too much about DPS meters so I just made sure to get my tranq shots off and did middle of the pack DPS(which is about all hunters are apparently capable of according to pservers).  Weaving abilities inbetween autoshots without clipping is interesting and honestly I liked hearing the old school gun noises(was sad that after I got Rhokdelar in MC I never had another good gun weapon until TBC).
---
Right now I am thinking about playing a hunter again or a druid so maybe that says something about what I preferred.  Priest however is still a possibility but I think I might prefer druid instead this time around.
---
I just realized how many people are gonna be elitist braggers about what they did in actual vanilla, in classic
---
Use this list.

---
I'm not going to give you this information for a few hours worth of gold.
---
My only goal is to make a point about the diversity of itemization in Vanilla.
---
People getting butthurt over this don't understand. I don't have a youtube channel, I don't stream, I don't care about reddit points. 
---
I only care about my playing Vanilla WoW, and I have no intention of losing competitive advantage.
---
When I played Heroes of the Storm (which I quit after Activision Blizzard shut down the pro circuit and most of my friends quit) I was Masters/Grand Masters rank, the top 1%-0.1% of the ranked ladder. Same situation, I don't stream, etc, there is no way I'm sharing the high level strats. Some people get butthurt over this, some people understand competition.
---
And of course a lot of pro players, especially ones not trying to grow their brand (ulterior motive) were similarly secretive.
---
If/when I'm a class officer in my guild in Classic, I'll share (most of) what I know with guildies, just like I do in my guild now.
---
Most of the valuable knowledge about Vanilla I've gained was only shared with me after months of raiding with my Naxx progressed guild (We have Thunderfury!) on my pserver.
---
Smart people with information worth sharing don't surrender that information for no reason. And while 500g is worth little, your word is worth even less.
---
I love how you managed to phrase "being bad on purpose" as a positive thing.
---
It's also hit, but itemization ain't the same in Classic as in 1.12 private servers. Locks will be good out of the gate. The only "loser" in classic as ranged is Hunter. Enjoy that ret paladin though and thinking that Classic is = the private server you play on.
---
Playing elf is disgusting 
---
I mean, there’s only french and germans with their own servers, so yeah, I think you wont be in the minority :D
---
That was awesome to watch. I saw the first couple of bosses in naxx, but only ever downed Anub. I'd heard of this crazy fight tho.
---
It's 8 tank, 8 little groups, 3stack max, move next on 30secs remaining if I remember.
---
One question, How many tanks did you poach from other guilds? xD
---
r/virginvschad
---
Doesn't have to be :) I played A LOT of Vanilla, always was slim and fit and managed to hang out with friends, play football, and manage it all. It's all in the head and a matter of balance. 
---
dungeons: warriors who tank
---
raids: resto shamans, dwarf priests [resto shamans significantly more in-demand than dwarf priests]
---
pvp: horde not-shadow priests (only defensive dispels on horde), alliance not shadow-priests [horde higher demand than alliance]
---
All of that word salad has nothing to do with +3 defense being virtually useless for a warlock. One of the things that makes vanilla wow vanilla is the fact a lot of gear is absolute shit with worthless stats on it. 
---
Interesting to see the mage using Flask of Titans.
---
I sincerely suspect many servers will never have 8/8 Naxx cleared ever.
---
Your gender too, sir!
---
Pretty much this. If you use TRP on live you'll know some of the stuff that gets posted. There's no way Blizz would make that official, they'd have to police the hell out of it, which not only are they probably not willing to do, but it kinda defeats its point. 
---
I picked up Silent Fang in an early run when I hit 60 and used it for most of my tanking carrier(I had shit luck with 1h drops)
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=13953#comments
---
The high speed was useful in getting a second hit in if my first missed, which was great for getting initial aggro on mobs.  I don't recall the proc being useful.
---
Exactly!
---
Those look like hot tomales...
---
I really like that candy
---
Male Night Elves are probably the most hideous thing that exists in classic WoW
---
That's what you think because you either lack the niche knowledge, the imagination, or both.
---
It is far more important for me to keep my niche knowledge to myself than it is to "convince" a single person on here. People who will get understand will do so. In fact I'm sure there will be quite a few experimentalists which will figure out the value of a lot of niche items and builds by themselves.
---
If you're left unconvinced that means nothing to me.
---
Trash talk all you like but I'm seeing, "Actually useful priest on both PvP and PvE" vs "Only picked this race to roll a female and strip in stormwind"
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **6th Cakeday** Shocker300! ^(hug)
---
&gt;I am perfectly OK with a subscription, if it means we get moderation/GM's and quality servers/connection.
---
We know we won't get the first (GMs). We know BfA doesn't get the second (quality servers/connection).
---
Here's hoping something works out for Classic.
---
Tanks are the most important player in the raid by a long shot, being an unoptimal race gimps the entire raid not just you. In that sense being human is very important (especially because the racial helps with threat, not survivability). You can tank without it no doubt, but your guild will suffer in efficiency (how big of a deal this is depends on the guild ofc).
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
This! The only female tauren I met while playing WoW was a 26 year old with 2 kids. She never raided or anything, but was always in Vent talking about her IRL drama.
---
Go with the male human protection paladin, if you find out you don't like tanking no big deal, just respec fury. You can even gear out fury while exploring tanking. Vanilla is much more about playing the class than the spec, and warrior is a hybrid that is #1 in *two* of three roles in PvE. 
---
You mean from the crowd who asks for changes to a class that is the best PVP healer, great at PVE healing can do both with one spec and who has a super strong 1 v 1, WPVP and pug bg spec with reck/ret? I'm not looking for their affection. They ruined the game the first time around. Don't want them to do the same again with their misinformation and stupidity. Being hated by them is a good thing. They should be playing Ret on the modern game they helped ruin. 
---
Classic is probably the safest product Blizzard have right now. It won't meet the fate of Titan as it's not a new MMO, the content has already been developed, and in terms of the layoffs they'd be very unlikely to fire new hires, especially before their work is done.
---
No one is saying there are not niche items and builds. No one. Not a single person. We are talking **specifically** about the +3 defense set bonus being useless. That’s it. You’re jabbering on about unrelated things. 
---
One less addon so you can make your game run smoother? Nah I'll take one less game feature so I can make my game run smoother.  
---
Use an addon.  
---
&gt; I cringe everytime I play with someone that speaks my language (german)  
---
Wait why?  
---
Well that fackbired.  
---
To be fair their death animation is so overly dramatic, and the cry is hilarious.
---
&gt;  how important a solid community is while simultaneously attempting to gatekeep that community and push away "the wrong sort of people" 
---
This is the very definition of a solid community. You just somehow don't understand this.
---
Crap, I'm a female tauren.  
---
I think human male are played by tryhards who actually aren't that great, and human female are played by tryhards who are pretty good but are assholes.  
---
had a human rogue and feral druid suddenly crush the 2v2 bracket on my server because they rushed with perception.  
---
the irony was the feral druid told me it was the lower rating they had a bit more trouble with because of the different match ups.  but when it hit the 2300+ part its all druid and rogue/warrior/warlock.  sometimes a mage rogue  and the perception opening was fucking brutal haha.  and the feral bonus giving 5% crit, wew.
---
I will go with one character, NEVER liked alting to be honest.
---
Source or are you just taking this stuff out of your ass ? Oh, I guess you are.
---
Hi, /u/Megaprana
---
Where was this actually useful except for AQ?
---
You would be amazed to know that most people are uninformed, even if they CAN inform themselves. Even today, on private servers, there are LOADS of players that have NO IDEA where most of the quests are.
---
And here is the WORST part : they ASK other players for answers/directions, even if they can find those answers / directions on line.
---
The REASON why they do NOT inform themselves is because they perceive it as a TIME LOSS. 
---
This is why MOST people that will play Classic will go in BLIND, and yes, they will be in a shock.
---
I don't get it. Why is a "Chad" the one with the perfect description?
---
I've literally never heard it used in that sense ever, but ok.
---
so self centered
---
I always get triggered and offended by the Shaman r13 6pcs set bonus - 40 attack power ;(
---
It is impossible to get verigans fist and still being ahed of the pack sins you need to run 4 different dungeons to get it.(not talking about clearing the dungeons just talking about getting to them and getting a group) and there is almost impossible to not get starved on mobs whit fast questers and mages aoe farming in dusk wood 
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
It's over for Dwarfcels
---
Soon is not SOON ENOUGH!!! 
---
When you are rushing these different racial mounts and cheaper mount prices.
---
AQ quest chain has already been confirmed.  
---
Why would they leave our the priest staff quest line?  
---
Where are you getting these thoughts?  
---
I’m scared :( 
---
[Please, don’t call the cops](https://youtu.be/bXFiNioMUJg) 
---
Wait, fights took 20  minutes in vanilla?
---
you will get burned out way faster by spending 3-5 hours each week doing nothing, but preparations for your raids.
---
you are cutting your raid time short. by increasing the time spent on chores.   
---
there is no net gain in time investment.   
---
all you end up doing if taking time from the fun part, raiding, anf putting it into the chores, farming and preparing. 
---
Aaand you're proving the point. 
---
Anxiety complex....mate it's just a video game at the end of the day.
---
I'd say its pretty stupid to launch a game when half the world is on vacation somewhere. Then again they maybe want to force you in wow or vacation. 
---
Nice link using smile.amazon instead of just amazon :D 
---
Very nice! :)
---
Fair enough, I obviously dont expect you to suddenly reveal your secret, I just have reaaally hard time believing 3 def couldnt be replaced by 10 stamina item for your niche tactic. I would rate even 1 stam a lot higher than 3 def actually.
---
They did discuss at Blizzcon that maybe it'd be better to revert the Macro and Addon systems back to how they were in Vanilla, just because the modern versions of them would allow for a very very different experience. The old system could be abused pretty hard though (like they are on pservers), so there are drawbacks to both sides.
---
The opposite holds true as well. No private server player consider PS to be 100% replica and that Classic will be an exact match to private servers. Whenever immature adults posts “I will cry tears of joy when private server people realise that classic isnt the same as their private servers”, yeah, that is a strawman as well.
---
Takes OP’s post for what it is, friendly banter showing how ridiculous this sub treats itself.
---
I heard they’re leaving out gnomes altogether since apparently it was a bug, not a race, in vanilla.
---
Also MC is gonna be a 17.5-man raid.
---
Those who havent played on private servers like to think that they will start on equal footing because private servers are not Classic, but they will be in for a surprise.
---
Really cool video, but don't hate on the female troll, my main was a female troll mage and at least I think they are really cool! :P
---
Sounds like Interstellar. Like a wormhole.
---
Good point.
---
I'm not that knowledgeable about macros, so I'm not the best person to comment. I do prefer the simplicity of modern macros though.
---
Considering the massive differences between the gamer of 2004 and the one today, I'd say that most people who speak English will join English-speaking realms.
---
20 years ago, the "internet" was mostly country-based. The social media of 20 years ago was in it's inception, and there was virtually no social network that was world-wide and big enough to draw in the users of country-based networks.
---
But today? Virtually EVERYONE that have a FB account, YT account, Twitter account, Instagram account, etc. etc. knows and speaks at least basic language.
---
Gamers? Almost all of them are above average in English.
---
back in bc I had a guild tank. she (cause thats what she was!) played a tauren MALE druid. a tank druid. she was 42, and from Germany. oh my...
---
It works ok for 5man dungeon (if you are playing with ppl that don't judge you). In raids you will go oom pretty quickly and even with a quiver and 25% extra mana the wand damage is extremely subpar.
---
Too small top to bottom for me but it’s sick otherwise
---
That'd be decent for PvP if it weren't for the stats on Magister being terrible.
---
Yep, the ratio of active users / registered users is always like 3 times bigger on /r/classicwow compared to /r/wow .
---
And what is even more interesting is that even with almost 20 times more registered users, /r/wow active users are NEVER 20 times more compared to /r/classicwow active users.
---
Normally, if /r/classicwow have 1,330 users online, /r/wow should have over 20k users online. They can't even get half that.
---
Clearly, Classic will be DEAD in 3 months. /s
---
Or you could take the charitable view on the position you think you're showing
---
Dude it’s just a reused me, don’t be that guy. 
---
7 stacks of bread?! no wonder you put that helmet on
---
The effect itself is actually great, but you would be gimping yourself by running the whole set because the stats are not as good as some other pieces. You want to ideally run 1-3 pieces
---
The fuckin ZG grind oh my fucking god I hate that raid and getting 10% extra rep is definitely worth it.
---
That’s their purpose in the game I think. To be a satisfying kill for a horde player. 
---
You're bloody right I want to see retail fail. That game is like an abusive girlfriend, and I want the gaming industry to change for the better
---
I wish trolls could be warlocks. There are no good looking lock races on Horde side :( 
---
Human male priest with a Dr. Phil haircut is the real Chad. 
---
Just like you did in school. No dating, no kids, and plenty of ephedrine adderall.
---
I'm legitimately unclear on this, what do you mean that BFA doesn't have quality servers? Are you referring to the need to shard or to stability?
---
Malfurion dies
---
I don't even know what it is.. think I've seen about three trolls so far. 
---
Close enough!
---
This is the reason why me playing male Tauren is going to be awkward, as soon as I join a Teamspeak. lmao
---
And you are (rightly so) a waddling gankmagnet for Hordies.
---
I am also considering Warlock and Rogue so don't worry, I'm not completely masochistic ;)
---
I have no idea why you're being voted down. This is literally correct. This game was originally for a certain demographic, which it isn't anymore, which is also the literal reason why we have people wanting vanilla
---
Also, is that the Tim Pool ice cream analogy I'm seeing?
---
What makes you think that they might willingly start deleting content from the game? lol
---
Which is next to useless in a good guild where TPS is all that matters.
---
You sound like someone who hates Vanilla, trying to defend the honor of retail. Why are you here?
---
We’ll see. You never know with Blizzard.
---
I hope not, though!
---
What’s the ZG grind for?
---
And season 2 of The OA!  
---
Ah I guess that's just me...
---
Prepare to play with a LOT of Scandinavians.
---
Yeah I just keep levelling alts as I really enjoy it, barely play the new expansion 
---
Watching the last season of GoT again right now, can’t wait. By the time the last season ends it won’t be long until Classic!
---
I mostly agree but i have some great endgame memories too. 
---
But yeah, levelling through STV with my friends was probably the most fun I ever had. Hunting down hordies and running like crazy when they came back with their mains lol good times 
---
God damn that flew by quick
---
Dwarves are fucking horrible. Tauren is where it's at.
---
He's asking whether it's a good idea or a bad idea, and your response sums up to "not gonna happen, why would they?" Projecting your preferences much? They haven't remade retail in 13 years but now they're doing that.
---
Is this pasta? 
---
I hope soon is 3 months late.... Because my university ends for the year around mid October....
---
Imagine not rolling dwarf or gnome, which is just dwarves for dwarves. Sounds awful.
---
There are some recipes if you are a crafter. Protip for classic, go with both alchemy and tailoring so the guild master will have to boost you through the rep to make bloodvine and mageblood potions. 
---
There's also the zanzas; 50 stam/spirit or movement speed which requires honored or revered. The ZG enchants for legs and head requires rep I think and the shoulder enchant requires exalted and is pretty powerful. 
---
It's extra painful for priests because very few items in ZG are good for them (except for shadow priests). 
---
Don't hate vanilla, you can appreciate a game without trying to make it out to be more than it is. Neither of these games is hard. You sound like somebody who can't interpret a comment, why are you here? 
---
Classes will still be 99% similar in gameplay you twat
---
Why do pserver players get so much hate on this sub?I’ve only played vanilla wow and pserver as of 3 or so months... honestly can’t tell a difference between the two. Sure there might be some minor differences between item stats n shit but the game overall plays the same as vanilla. (maybe the pserver I play on is just really well done?)
---
Not pictured is the third photo taken after dealing with 39 other people who can’t move out of fire. This third photo is also the first.
---
You are asking the wrong question. Or you are asking the question wrong.
---
It is now about what the non-raiders CAN DO in Classic that they CAN'T DO in retail. It is about what RELEVANT THINGS the no-raiders can do in Classic that they can't do in retail.
---
In retail, EVERY SINGLE PIECE of content outside  MYTHIC raiding and high key mythic+ is absolutely IRRELEVANT. A non-raider in retail will quickly realize that everything outside mythic raiding and high key mythic+ is nothing but a repetitive activity that have no impact on his game play, except wasting his time.
---
In Classic, 5 men and 10 men dungeons will always be relevant for a non-raider. But not only that. 20 men raid content in Classic, after a while, becomes accessible and relevant for a non-raider, even if technically is a raid. A non-raider is not a player that never raids...it is a player that don't usually raids.
---
Now, LOTS of people in retail complete the LFR content...but that content, the rewards from that content and the impact of completing a raid in LFR is absolutely meaningless. You can do it time and time again, but that is nothing but a repetitive, irrelevant activity.
---
Running Zul'Gurub twice a month, doesn't make you a raider. But every single ZG run, the content, the rewards and the impact of completing a ZG run is very meaningful for a non-raider.
---
Everything that is meaningful in retail is exclusively designed for TOP HARDCORE PLAYERS, most of them being raiders. A non-raider in retail is basically barred from playing high-end content. He won't get a spot in a guild mythic raid run. He won't get a spot in a mythic +15 or higher. All he can do is repeating meaningless content, like LFR, WQ, WF, IE, mythic+0 to +5.
---
The ONLY reason why non-raider players are STILL playing retail is because warforging and titanforging, in the HOPES that after a WQ or LFR, he will get a titanforged piece of gear...even if he will NEVER actually use that piece of gear for mythic raiding or high key mythic+.
---
ALL content in retail, except mythic raiding and high key mythic+ is IRRELEVANT.
---
&gt;or gnome, which is just dwarves for dwarves
---
Holy shitballs, lmao!
---
What is a stance dance macro? One button that changes stance for you and uses the ability so you dont need two keybinds?

Don’t forget avengers endgame
---
10/10 I was cringecapped halfway through, not bad at all.
---
Or will be the other way around.
---
Probably this sub will explode after launch, and will be very active for months to come.
---
&gt; I sincerely suspect many Classic servers will never have 8/8 Naxx cleared ever.
---
Well I disagree. This time will be completely different.
---
Naxx lasted 6 months or so before TBC launched. And as I read many guilds gave up on progression because of that and the fact that acquired gear was to be quickly replaced by Outlands gear.
---
&gt; They're not on reddit because they're playing BfA. 
---
&gt; because they're playing BfA. 
---
&gt; they're playing BfA. 
---
I somehow disagree that the reason that /r/wow is 3 times less active than r/classicwow is because they're playing BfA.
---
Playing BfA...why would ANYONE do that :D ?
---
STV. How could anyone get this wrong. 
---
I want this as a full sized map holy shit
---
You're one of those thinks inside the box kind of guys, aren't you?
---
Instability, lag with more than 40 people in the same area.
---
1 stamina? That's 10hp. 10 stamina, maybe, but it depends. I'm not arguing it's BiS. It's not "completely useless", there is a niche for it.
---
But they’re certainly not going to buff Paladins. So what’s the problem? 
---
You lose a huge amount of hit by running 8/8 T2. It’s only good for pvp. 
---
Zangarmarsh, change my mind.
---
Why? That’s a very good set bonus. 
---
Having finished naxx and farmed for a couple months finally on a pservers after only killing 2 bosses in naxx vanilla, changed my perception of it. The fights are not super complicated or hard. 
---
Similar to the past raids but the difference is everyone needs to Max out with the corrects consumes and do your job as a class and being 1/40 of the raid. If everyone follows this rule the clear will go relatively smooth. 
---
The consumes part was big problem in vanilla because the flasks we're retardly expensive because of the gold farmers/sellers. I remember I never bought flasks of supreme power in vanilla because they were like 200-300g per. God damn the way blizzard did black lotuses in vanilla we're so bad. Thankfully the pservers fixed that a bit.
---
That's a pretty reckless assumption you're making there... I'm with you.
---
Yeah you need a decurser in there. 
---
I'm doing a rewatch, just finished S2!
---
Is that coming out this year? I watched the first season of that!
---
I used to go through it all again the first 4 seasons before a new one started but now it’s just too much haha
---
People seem to forget that there aren’t many alliance Warlocks and Spriests at all. Which makes escape artist more valuable. 
---
So Dwarves are the new little people I see.
---
When I tried Pservers I apparently liked 1-20 leceling so much I couldn’t progress further without re-rolling
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
Honestly if you believe this, this is the best (worst) case of malicious compliance I've ever seen. Imagine having players actually buy into expansions that you knew were pretty shite, but you still profited off their complaints. 
---
what do you mean frost shock is there
---
Private servers are emulation. Not all mechanics are guaranteed to be replicated I would assume.
---
Ice City Castle
---
I second this. These are awesome.
---
My thoughts exactly man.
---
this is obviously zeldas house in final fantasy
---
i see its time to re-post this video huh ;v
---
https://imgur.com/5bvP9HB.png
---
The predicted release date is BS, it’s not releasing until August 
---
For me its the mixing of German and English which we call "Denglis(c)h". It just ruins the immersion for me.
---
Aditionally, after I switched from a german server in Vanilla/TBC to private servers I had to relearn all the names of the abilities, items, and even acronyms (for instances) athough my English was decent at the time. If you don't know how something is called in english its also hard to follow english content.
---
Is that a fucking *d o w n r a n k e d s e a r i n g t o t e m* and an *a u t o a t t a c k*?

---
Good morning Vietnam! 
---
Still my favorite fight (though I quit after TBC). The fact that the difficulty was in big part figuring out how to do it was amazing, and tanking it was fun every time (that you didn't get invisible void zoned). Seriously so many wipes not knowing a strategy wouldn't work trying to figure out the details. Just such a fun encounter.
---
There's also plenty of people who dgaf and say very little on the matter, making it seem like there are more unpleasant people than there actually is.
---
Not enough corpses 
---
im quite hopeful there are many others in the same situation and we can find guilds that only raid 2, 3 times a week at night
---
Yeh, pretty much.
---
I'm shocked I am still hyped tbh.
---
So what's the takeaway I should be getting from watching this video?
---
What I see is a paladin using a cheesy mechanic to one shot another player. Personally I have a hard time believing that reckbomb in its current form on private servers will make its way to classic.
---
How do you believe Reckoning will be implemented in classic?
---
Troll mages should be able to conjure softdrugs
---
You forgot to bind busshock it seems! :-) 
---
Hell yea, even in BC I would go back to Ashenvale and que for arena while chillin there
---
Don’t forget down-ranked spells too.
---
You’ll need at least Earth Shock, Flame Shock and Frost Shock rank 1 binded.
---
I third this!
---
Seriously?! That's kind of insane. I played hunter in Retail Vanilla and never noticed this.
---
I'm pretty sure you can at least tag targets with your pet, right? I distinctly remember sending my pet off while I'm eating+drinking to tag a quest mob to keep someone else from tagging it.
---
The fun starts even before the character creation. It starts with an idea for a race/class combo, an idea for the characters name and looks. It starts with a dream of possibilities.
---
It's one of those things where as you become more geared and experienced, you'll be able to take more shortcuts and spec more aggressively. If you're at the point where you have Ash and enough hit gear to not need survival and are confident, then you'll know if you can afford to be more reckless. That is not me in that farming route!
---
No expert here, had a similar experience. I thought it was a gear issue, but found I couldn’t do it effectively until I had more talents, better gear or was a few levels higher than the mobs.
---
Greater Nature Protection Potion. You'll blow through stacks of them very quickly if your guild isn't hardcore enough to clear AQ40 instantly.
---
I distinctly remember "negative resists." Doesn't that mean spell pen has value regardless of whether or not the mob has resistances?
---
Hell no. I enjoyed it the first time. Now its gonna be a chore
---
Everyone wants to hit revered because then you can get zanza pots for raids, and they are amazing. The most common one is +50stam +50spir and even lasts through death at the very least pre-naxx.
---
Yes its r1 searing totem. Thats used in pvp all the time against casters. And yes, its the autoattack button for my 2 attack macros. One that will target the closest enemy and not stop attack or change tarhet if spammed and one that do the same but works as a tab target. Ypu can make that as a macro without the attack button on the bar but its super long and complicated.
---
I love revisiting the leveling zones, though for me the real fun is raiding.
---
You mean you want a full-sized map of Azeroth like this, or just STV?
---
I already cook my weekly food on the wedneyday morning downtime. I dont have time for other things in that time window QQ

Stranglethorn vietnam
---
what am I a fuckin moron? this is clearly grizzly hills
---
A lot of you really seem to like these Lore videos, so I think I'll be making one for every dungeon (and possibly every raid) in Classic. I'm actually learning a lot about Azeroth's history researching it all which is a lot of fun. Hope you all enjoy this one too. BFD was the first dungeon I ran way back in 2004, so it holds a special place in my heart. See you this Summer!
---
*bang on door*
---
Sheriff's department, open up!!!
---
All right. I never really touched PvP in vanilla so I wouldn't know, and I'm not familiar with those 2 macros.
---
I'm sure you know this, but keep in mind we don't know Ironfoe's real proc rate. It might not really be worth it, or it might be worth farming for months until you get it, and anything in between.
---
Its the AV mana/healing bread.
---
I honestly thought it sounded la lot ike tough guy navy SEAL copy pasta.
---
That's 100% accurate. Pally Warrior was unbearable for us, but they couldn't break 2100 with all the Druids in the meta, so once you broke that soft ceiling you breezed to the top 10.
---
Yeah. March 22nd if my memory is correct. I'm too lazy to check.  
---
So after 1.9.3 people couldn't do it anymore during Vanilla :o ?
---
The one tick regen savings will lead to 3 bag slots earlier packing up camp and returning to the vendor when farming. 
---
I actually used Ironfoe as an example in my original post, but then I deleted it because I thought the conversation about Ironfoe's true proc rate would derail the thread.  
---
these are really cool man keep it up
---
Assuming you have 4 hours sleep per night, that's 5 days 20 hours /played to ding 60. I really don't see full guilds doing this. The WR for a hunter was 4.5 days /played, let alone a warrior.
---
Cape town, Africa
---
I think they mean a full sized Azeroth as I would also third this. It's cool
---
That sounds like a reasonable conclusion.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Server lag maybe? You want the blizzard in front of them with it just barely where they are. Then another. Nova and the next one should get em. Blizzard does not benefit from spell power much at all so stack as much int gear as you can for mana. Private servers can also be inaccurate on mob health or resist values and stuff, so if you are following the old guide it might not be super accurate. 
---
Later when you get cone of cold it's mainly for if a nova gets resisted. Before that and coldsnap you can simply have bad luck pulls. It does get easier it's just hard those first few levels.
---
That's the place I camp once I'm done rushing to 60. 
---
You can do that in the client: When you change stances, you change bars, so just put the skill you want to use over the bar slot. 
---
I assume it's one that also changes you back, but let's be real: That's 3 apm and gives no information.
---
Love BFD was my first dungeon too. So atmospheric 
---
So the concept of an example is lost on you?
---
You can't honestly say that vanilla is mechanically harder than retail with a straight face, can you? You can hate retail all you like, it is flawed as hell - but mechanically it is harder. Take away the gear dependancy and vanilla is a cake walk.
---
If you don't like my Onyxia example, then look at Naxx. One of the most known "hardcore" encounters in vanilla is the Four Horsemen. And why was it so hard? Because you needed to gear up 4 tanks (along with the rest of the raid of course). It is literally known to be "hard" due to the extreme tuning of numbers, which is just another way of phrasing "gear dependent".
---
You don't need to reset Cho'Rush to be able to tribute runs.
---
Pretty nice wonderdraft work I think?
---
Vietnam
---
Pfft... that’s obviously Warsong Gulch
---
Almost as many as there are in retail. :-)
---
I need a good quality version of that artstyle for the Howling Fjord or full Northrend on a Canvas or a nice fabric poster. Would definitely buy.
---
Never had any problems like this. If anything throughout leveling I had enough mana for one or two extra spells. Maybe you're like one level away from a blizzard upgrade? 
---
But not too late, because we got work the next day. And with frequent breaks, because the kids keep bothering us. And plenty of people on standby, because the baby might wake up. Oh, and Cynthia has her ladies night out on saturdays, so get a replacement please.
---
why play at all, really? just watch some youtube vids of the old raids, it's the most consistent experience you'll get.
---
Soft?
---
Is it BWL?
---
What the hell are you talking about? /roll just spits out a random number. It doesn't take into account past/future incarnations.
---
Omg I remember my first time ever leveling. No add-ons nothing lost AF. I still remember seeing a road sign outside the undead starting area and like Jesus fuck this is so big they have signs for directions. Every time I see the brill deathknell sign it brings me back to that night it's crazy
---
*raises hand*
---
Well, do you really need that much more than in vanilla? A nicer frame for healers, some alert addon. Vanilla does the same.
---
I do agree with you that addons to trivialise content are no fun, but honestly I haven't raided for world first or server first on retail, and outside of that I don't really think it's required.
---
I guess one place it is required is mythic+ dungeons where you are trying to perfect your time, but even here I'd say it's mostly the very top guilds that needs it. I personally played retail for several years even without any alert addon. I mean, you can even check out all the boss abilities beforehand in the games Dungeon Journal.
---
I think the reason it might look as a "requirement" is because most people tend to take the easiest way. But as I've already said, the same really goes for vanilla. You can perfectly well play competitively without addons on retail.
---
Avengers lost me when they took a series about teamwork and ruined it, inserting a "superstar", sell insert character that makes everyone else less (including the female characters) that was written by narcissists that has failed as a comic book character in 6 recent reboots. Then they called everyone Nazi's for not liking what they did. Love the rest of your list though. Will never support Disney again on anything after TLJ and taking the same all powerful character with no struggles and growth that people hate from that trilogy and making her Carol Manvers. Disney has lost the plot and are being eaten by a cancer from within.
---
agree this is actually incredible
---
As a general concept I enjoy leveling more than endgame, ESO for example has probably my all time favorite leveling where as I don't care about the endgame at all. 
---
In WoW however the leveling is just atrocious and a slog I feel like I have to suffer through in order to get to the enjoyable part of the game.
---
The zone that everyone hates and loves 
---
Ah Nah you can assume that all day I'm gladly a female orc warrior.
---
It's home
---
Ah this reminds me of my pre-made PVP group in AB. My only job as a warrior was to camp the lumber mill flag, it was easy work.
---
A rogue sapped me expecting me to pop berserker rage to break out of it, but I just sat there, waiting for him to open on me so I can pop it during one of his other disables.
---
He never engaged after the sap and I still fucking laugh.
---
TIA! 
---
I'm the hunter who will be mining your nodes while /laughing at you son. 
---
Both these posts are great 
---
I’m going with troll priest too. My undead character will be a warlock. 
---
It's a play on 'Based and redpilled' which effectively translates to 'Glorious and socially conservative', with bluepill being the Socially Liberal counterpart. 
---
Human female priest crew checking in.
---
I did it for the first time in 2013, blew my mind. Our guild carried some pub from chat and he got.. all the achievements. Seeing him jump around at the end and spamming guild chat was pretty funny.
---
A certain pserver has this fix implemented and its sill no problem to solo.
---
&gt;Is it fixing something ?
---
The key fix is meaningless since you just loot it every time no problem then blast the next door.

The fondest memories I have of Classic is leveling up and exploring Azeroth. Wandering around Dun Morogh for the first time and being mesmerized by how beautiful the snowy mountains are and stumbling through the mountain pass in the eastern edge of the zone and ending up in Loch Modan, a warm, forested mountain lake, and a completely different area, blew me away. 
---
Taking the ship to Theramore and ending up discovering this entire other continent of Kalimdor that I as a fresh noob at WoW had no idea how to get to before really impressed me. Darkshore, Ashenvale and Tanaris also really left an impression on me. 
---
There’s something about the character investment with the older versions of WoW. You sink more time and effort into toons so they grow on you. They’re more than avatars, they’re living figments and you’re seeing the world through them. 
---
The fun for me comes from the constant improvement whilst levelling. Finding a new item or weapon feels good. Knowing you’ll be hitting stuff harder adds to that feeling.
---
Back in the day it was all about looking your best - showing off your gear around town or Goldshire. There was some serious fun to that, too.
---
Then there’s the fun gained from min/maxing. Preparing all week for a raid and turning up to do your best felt great. And if you did better that your group it felt amazing because you knew all of that work had paid off. You were being the best you possibly could. 
---
Levelling has a unique fun-ness to it that can only be experienced once - the first time you play to cap. That’s partially a learning process too, as abilities and strategies click. Just you and the big wide world.
---
I’m hoping Classic WoW can recapture that feeling.
---
do i need to do the first blizzard at max range? maybe thats what im doing wrong
---
Is sis Stars wars?
---
those are way too easy dude. 
---
Maybe next time you could make it blurry or zoom in and only show one specific location of that area or something.
---
I like how you made the dwarf and his bear the same person
---
For me, it's an excellent year for Starcraft eSports and WoW Classic will definitely force me to make some tough decisions after it releases. Real life, WoW, or catch up on VoDs? It's going to be very tough. 
---
When I lived in Germany a friend always complained about the low quality voice acting in video games and I always wondered how dwarves and trolls sound in German. Do they try do affect an accent like the English game or is it all just straight German? 
---
20 is the sweet spot though isn’t it because you get to make some defined decisions about your class at that level. 
---
You see all of the cool shit and then you start wondering what other classes have that you don’t. 
---
Or have a car crash you would have avoided had you been 4 seconds further back.
---
Which class has the cleanest UI for PvP?

&gt;Doing quests with your friends, even doing new friends

what is that tent in the ocean on the right?
---
Seconded, would buy as a poster! 
---
Read my comment again, vanilla raids focus on the individual while retail is more of a group effort. And I'm not arguing that Naxx is harder than Mythic raiding, it definitely isn't.
---
4H is really hard because the entire raid must know where to go and depending on how the fight evolves they will have to improvise. The 6 tank method is a lot harder than the 8 tank setup but it requires less tanks so it might be easier in that regard. 4 tanks is Wrath 4H which was pretty easy. 
---
Another thing making 4H pretty hard is that threat meters don't work particularly well. So you have to be super careful with aggro and for some classes like warlocks and warriors this is really hard. Guilds who have Naxx on farm for months still wipe on 4H occasionally.
---
They’re chad af don’t ever disrespect the bush haired Illidan wannabe ever again.
---
I will look into it.
---
The thing I'm looking forward to the most is the levelling. I'm looking forward to Thousand Needles the most, I have so much nostalgia for that place.
---
Oh yea this is Detroit right?
---
This should really be the classic box art. 
---
I really enjoyed it when I leveled my first character back in Vanilla. I really enjoyed it when I leveled my first character on a pserver years later because it all felt new again. Every character after that is a hellacious rush to 60. 
---
Not if you lay it atop the keyboard.
---
You're making it too easy. Take someplace where nobody goes, like Desolace!
---
I don’t think it was intentional.
---
I think they put all their eggs in the Wrath basket - which is what made it so good. But after that the lore took it all downhill.
---
Lovely
---
India 
---
I.e. prepare to have a good time. Scandinavians are awesome.
---
looks like goldshire and SW are the same distance this maps SW and STV
---
As a Scandinavian I can confirm. ❤️
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that buff is confined to just the group the druid is in.  
---
You mean my ditch digger, because I don't mine.  It's good that there's an entry level job for you in Azeroth to make you feel right at home.
---
No
---
Beatiful! 
---
Yeah most buffs in vanilla are party wide not raid wide.
---
Frozen by Madonna and Bittersweet symphony by The Verve. 
---
Watched a 3 man Onyxia run (Prot warr, hunter and holy pala if anyone is curious) that was actually done back in Vanilla and it blew my freaking mind. Those songs were played over the video. 
---
Yes. I love the early levels. There are certain zones on the way up that I look forward to. I love levelling professions. I enjoy just chilling and grinding the odd level along the way. I absolutely live for 5-person dungeons. Raids are just the cherry on a very excellent cake.
---
In classic or retail? I'm thinking of giving it a go a while after classic releases. Something to do once my main and main alts are levelled.
---
I want this as an addon to replace my in-game map.  
---
I'm rewatching the whole thing for the first time before the last season drops (seen it all before but only once, saw each episode live). I'm on season 4 so far.
---
Sorry, I misread that part. 
---
But I'd still argue that both the team effort *and* individual mechanical skills needed are higher in retail.
---
I don't try to say 4 Horseman is an easy fight, my point is the absolute main reason it is so hard is the tuning, and therefor the gear dependency. Sure there are mechanical things to think about. I'm not degrading vanilla raids and honestly I somewhat enjoy them more, but I don't think they require more skill than retail in any way, team or individual. It is, above anything else, a gearing challenge.
---
You just outrange and LoS Cho'rush. He frequently starts casting spells and by the time he finishes you are already out of range again or hidden behind an object.  
---
The way the hunter in your example does it is actually really bad despite using the exploit.
---
The key change is to prevent people from killing the first boss for the key, then resetting DM, then doing a tribute run utilizing said key. It is something that can still be done on some private servers if you don't have anyone with engineering/blacksmithing or a rogue. But any self-respecting hunter would just open that door with a large seaforium charge (engineering).
---
And would the statement be true if the whole raid got the buff?
---
Now this is exactly the kind of high quality content I sub for. 
---
Lul this guy
---
Very much so especially because 3 cousins also played and only 1 was into raiding. I had 5 level 60s when TBC was released. 
---
This is actually amazing, do azeroth in all its glory and print them on posters to sell, I'll buy one! 
---
You referring to captain marvel? I haven't seen it, is it that bad? Did they give the marvel universe the Mary Sue treatment just like they did to Star Wars now?
---
Don't everyone use full t3?
---
It sucks that GoT is ending though. Then again, they're so far ahead of GRRM, it's best to end it.
---
Wednayday
---
I’m sorry but how could anyone possibly have trouble guessing these?
---
I can't wait for classic wow I will be mainly doing pvp, what is the best way to prepare for that, I thought about making a new character and leveling to 60 then just doing bgs but I will slowly level, any ideas? Thank you :)

I’ve seen you put up a few of these. Do you have a gallery or something with them all?

All the rogues are laughing. All of them.

Upvoted for truth, gnomes are a mistake. 
---
They do this for a retail macro:
---
/startattack
---
and
---
/targetenemy  
---
and they look like this:
---
/script if not IsCurrentAction(25) then UseAction(25) end;
---
/script TargetNearestEnemy();  
---
And then I just put autoattack on spot 25.

She looks like a Lord of the Rings elf would look at a dwarf.

As somebody who only watches the films and has no interest in the MCU comics, I found it okay, not good, but not bad either.

I almost see it as one giant trailer for the Avengers trilogy.

southern STV sir
---
GoT is over now? Great, they I might start watching it.
---
For PVE It wildly depends on the tier of content, hunters are strong early, mages middle of the pack, locks low. BWL locks catch up and all 3 are good, AQ mages and warlocks with hunters average, naxx mages and warlocks are neck and neck with hunters being decently behind
---
Call to arms

Southern STV, the very tip is Booty Bay.

Ah I just relied on someone else to farm that. The lack of brood of nozdormu rep meant you couldn't get certain bits of gear/weapon
---
Which also makes you blind.
---
All classes can look clean. There are not many cooldowns to keep track off so even with my 7 bars I could probably put 6 on auto-hide and only show one bad at the bottom. Warriors probably have the cleanest by default as their abilities change depending on what stance they use and they only use max rank for their abilities.

---
Absolutely, the leveling is what I love most about vanilla. I used to level alts all the time, and I look forward to doing so in summer!
---
On esfands classic cast he was talking to a dev who said he found out about classic wow about 7 months before blizzard told the public. And he estimates it was in development about a year before he knew about it (just a couple peoples side projects at that point though)
---
So seeing how long is been in development and has a planned release in a couple months I'd wager its already done and they're just working on bugs and balance issues right now. 
---
If by "having cost reduced / removed for respecing" is equal to "everything given for free", then yes.
---
Why?
---
I look forward to being lost, but then again i have not leveled a character in classic since 2005
---
you can solo tribute even with cho'rush aggroed
---
Sure, unlike on retail I can't wait for levelling in Classic.
---
However I have to say I'm hyped for endgame too.
---
While that's dumb I wouldn't mind being able to install classic on my phone so I could use the chat and auction house while I am at a restaurant or pooping or something.
---
As long as there's no changes to the actual game. 
---
I absolutely agree - and I feel like being railroaded and pushed towards endgame is what killed the later expansions for me. Up to WoTLK, I always just enjoyed the aesthetic and wonder of exploring the world.
---

It’s not “being bad.” 
---
Seriously, having worse racials while being 99% is not “bad.” It is being “non-optimal” or being “slightly worse in a way that most people don’t care about.” The idea that priests can’t get into a guild if they aren’t dwarves, which I’ve seen floated on this sub a lot is absolute lunacy. In vanilla, dwarves were the least played race of priest on the alliance, on my server anyway. I don’t think it will be much different in classic. Dwarves may be slightly more populated, but they certainly won’t overtake humans, and I’m not sure they’ll overtake NE either. 
---
There were "mods" (Addons, you cretin) back in 2004.
---
Always have something to look forward to, be it a new spell, talent, mount, or a class quest with a good reward (whirlwind axe)
---
I've only published two so far. When I'm done with them all I'll probably archive them somewhere. Full-scale Azeroth map coming up next.
---
Elwynn Forest OST obviously. POD - Alive, Soil - Pride.
---
And Village People - In the Navy. I watched that damn Vurtne vs those 2 rogues so many times it's just too much fun to not rewatch that 450 times.
---
This is brilliant! Thanks for the new wallpaper!
---
A quiver speeds up want attack speed?
---
Awesome. I’d pay to get physical copies if they were available. 
---
The first circle of hell?
---
please DM me for price, thanks!
---
As someone who just leveled a rogue and warrior to 60 on private. Rogue was 100x easier. Decent gear, riposte spec, engineering and bandaids? You wont have any issues. 
---
I think from a gameplay perspective I like the endgame better, when you have all your spells and all content is open to you. However, the best experience I've had in Vanilla was when two of my friends and I rediscovered it again with Nost, I don't think anything beats the fun of levelling with a group of friends, it just naturally leads to so many memories.
---
For some reason I thought this was gonna be a 1% wipe. 
---
Don't make me get my main
---
Yeah it does, but caveats. Listen to Countdown to Classic mages episode to find out more

You're hilarious.

Shattered Hand EU intensifies 
---
Love the style of this. Very well done :)
---
that's obviously goldshire
---
That was the first thing I saw too. Horrible memories of flushing 170g down the drain with a fat finger
---
It's all about probability maths, and you cant just multiply 3% by 40. It makes no sense.
---
Chance to get at least 1 crit in 40 attacks is a kind of pointless thing to consider anyway, not least because everyone attacks at different rates and ferals dont affect spell crit.
---
3% crit chance is 3% crit chance for 5 people - the five in the group of the Feral. Total number of crits will increase by +3% above the normal amount. It'll increase the damage of THOSE FIVE PEOPLE by approximately 3% (a bit less than 3% really, as it depends on their base crit chance.).
---
TLDR: I think you need to read up some maths books about how probability works.
---
Rolling pala with warrior friend. Think we’ll be alright. 
---
Yes
---
Putting a lot of the more situational totems on a bar you can shift+mousewheel up made managing it a lot easier for me. It takes a little time to get the muscle memory but when you do it’s pretty smooth
---
Urgh. Malaysia? Thailand..Cambodja,..shit, not sure man
---
Leveling new chars, twinking, 2manning low level dungeons and going back to old content on a level 60 is among my fav things to do in the game.  
---
Endgame has its appeals but it's good to remind yourself that there's a lot more content
---
I definitely prefer the levelling journey in Vanilla as I never made it to the endgame. 
---
100% better than a picture of a book
---
When ever I start an alt, I get bored around lvl 8 and never look back.
---
Please please please make a full map of Azeroth with detailed zones! 
---
Dude this art is AMAZING, do a full sized classic map PLEASE, I'll hang it on my wall
---
These pictures of zones tickle my memories so hard.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Even if I restart on a new pserver, I pick the same name, class, race and look over and over again. It's just my Azeroth-me. Can't escape your virtual personality.

Strangle thorn vale?
---
Well you have to take into consideration mana and threat. For example on Ragnaros, most mages would run oom since its long fight.
---
Fight like Nefarian, also damn long and you might pull aggro as Warlock. But hunters usually did most dps here because they could reset aggro. Rogues would be 99% time dead on Nefarian because of the class calls.
---
Keep them coming, please. I've played WoW from Vanilla up to the start of Cataclysm, and in all those years never knew the lore behind the dungeons, because I wasn't interested. Your short and easily digestible vids do make it interesting.
---
I'm working on that one at the moment :)

I wonder how far in advance we will get a release date.  I'm guessing about 6 weeks.  Enough time for them to market properly, but not too far out where they are still working on things and hoping it will be ready by the target date.

You have no need to reset cho'rush at all and key thing doesn't mean a thing at all either.

There's vanilla footage of people soloing tribute without separating cho'rush. The video you linked was from 4 years ago when it was possible to split them on this private server. It was fixed obviously.

Yes you could. https://youtu.be/dXE_RR5XzE8?t=683

There's a countdown to classic podcast interview with someone who goes in depth into a smite priest. I think the main idea was that shadow priests were more efficient, but smite priests were more viable than people give them credit for.

Leveling is more fun than end game 
---
I enjoy leveling to this day.  The entire journey.  I get attached to my characters... or at least I did/would like to.  so sometimes it takes a bit before I can 'get into it' or into a specific character, but it's lovely when it does click.
---
I don't mind it taking a while to level at all.  I prefer it taking a bit. The game doesn't stop being fun at maxlevel either though.   I enjoy most of the content and i'm fine just going at my own pace.
---
There's something to be said about taking it slow, or having a bit of a grind to do each day.  Opportunities to just chill with the guild or other familiars on the server that you see over the weeks or months as you level alongside.

Evanescence - My Immortal
---
I can’t recall if it was during vanilla but there was this one popular YT video where some guy showed all his max level characters &amp; explained how WoW had ruined his life. His family left him &amp; he was laid off from work...and then he starts deleting his characters &amp; all this while ”my immortal” is playing in the background.
---
Some details could be wrong because well it’s been a couple of years. And iirc the uploader later  changed the song to something more upbeat for whatever reason, maybe copyright. 
---
Now that I think about it, it could have been a joke/fake but either way, that song will always remind me of the old days of wow, the wow that ruined lives literally. 
---
Go on :)
---
Ah right you'll be buying gold then. Quite embarrassing I'd of kept that to yourself kiddo. 
---
As soon as I seen the picture I heard fortune son in my head... Also trying to hit 40 to get ur mount was pure hell.
---
On pservers it is common for players to level fury until 40 and abusing the /sit crit to proc enrage (it was introduced in TBC so it's not blizzlike), we know this won't be possible in classic, and everyone will recommend you to level arms in classic because it is better, hell most people leveled arms anyway because fury isn't even that good.
---
I'm in the same boat, will also roll on english speaking servers. 
---
He should have rolled an orc
---
All of my beat memories and most of the fun has always been with the leveling experience and just chilling with the game. Raiding and end game has its fun elements too, but feels more like a task than just starting fresh with a new toon. 
---
You still need exalted for the shoulder enchant. Nozdormu only takes a lot of time before the gates are open because you have to do those horrendous turn-in quests. Once you're inside AQ40 you get artifacts and insignias which boost your rep a lot and of course all the trash + bosses.

Yeah retail raids and mythic+ dungeons require everything from your raid. 
---
I'd say some dungeons require more skill than retail dungeons. I'd say Scholomance at appropriate gear levels is a lot harder than mythic dungeons. Not harder than Mythic+ though. 
---
I also like how laid back and easy Vanilla raiding is. It's a much more social experience in a way, but it's really subjective if you like it or not.
---

Some of the most fun I've had in wow was PvPing while leveling.

I used to be in the rush to max-level mindset, but once you slowdown you end up enjoying the game a lot more.
---
You are both idiots. It's obviously Moria. 
---
I really like Marling but that series is weird (still watched most of S1...).
---
I leveled Engineer on my Hunter in Vanilla. A really cool interaction was using the Gnomish Mind Control Cap and then using Eyes of the Beast. It made it work like a Priest MC
---
When I first leveled, it was definitely magical. I can remember one moment crossing the bridge in Feralas (almost 13 years ago) that just kinda made me stop and look around in awe.  I loved finding mysterious caves.  I loved fighting things not knowing what they can do.  I have taken maybe 7 characters 1-60.  That magic is gone, but I remember it.  I get my joy in the planning, now.  That isn't to say I am not caught off guard at times (I was swimming in the ocean and was struck by how how real the emotion of fear was when I looked down), but the original feels probably won't come back
---
Fake vid, the ret was casting a heal on someone other than himself at the end...nice try guy but you can't fool me
---
STV
---
I don’t think this will be near as prevalent as you think, this isn’t a new game and all of these things are going to be known well before someone rolls on a classic server. Some people feel the need to tell retail players this every time classic is brought up. They’ll likely just quit after a while or not play classic at all. 
---
The complaints Classic fans need to worry about are “this community is toxic” “you can’t ask a question without being called a retail kiddie” etc. 
---
Shakira - Hips Don’t Lie was a hit song when I was raiding in vanilla. My guild would always be singing it over Teamspeak while we /danced 
---
Im currently leveling a shaman. When in my 20s I did one single run of WC and managed to get 4/5 of the set lol. Always nice joining a dungeon and leaving with 5+ upgrades.
---
All i no is ALOT of adults are coming back to Classic WoW. No kids which means alot of them will stay. Kids will try it out and some will leave for Retail Wow. But alot of old timers like myself will stay. We now what MMO's used to be like before microtranactions and all the other crap them put into MMO's over the years. 
---
Now Classic on launch will not have theses in.  Vanilla set off a whole chain reaction of MMO'S, people miss that and it was the kids back then which have all grown up now which want that back. 
---
Yeah, I don't really enjoy mythic+ raiding. But then again, I never was a fan of hard PvE content in terms of mechanics. I'll play a single player game for that. This is probably why I enjoy vanilla and TBC raiding so much - as you say, its a social experience. I prefer my "hard" gaming to come from PvP instead and just have fun in PvE with friends, which is a great fit for vanilla in my opinion.

Do you raid in current retail as well? Im a hardcore Raider in retail and never raided in classic. I’m wondering how the actual gameplay (not including prep work) compares 
---
Finkle's Skinner is an underrated weapon that I've seen tanks use, it's super fast and has good dps. Drops from UBRS. 
---
I’m curious why you feel 1-58 doesn’t “matter” but then something magically happens at lvl 60 and now it’s possible to do something in wow that “matters.” Could you elaborate?
---
Muse - Invincible

Because of Gegon
---
cant tell the diffrence
---
Stacking classes would be strong.  Three rogues rubbing someone's nose in the dirt while their friends stand around helplessly sounds strong.

Triple hunter, mage, or warlocks could be very strong as well.

Age of empires meats World of Warcraft
---
Not to mention the biggest advantage overall when leveling on a PVP server: stealth. Being able to pick your battles and avoid getting ganked is massive to leveling speed. Compared to a warrior who is basically shit out of luck, eating after every mob and then you get a wonderful hunters mark on your head....prepare for the GY run back.
---
Thank you! My group that I will be playing with does have 1 tank and 3 dps so if I went heals we would be able to do dungeons on our own. My issue is I’m not sure if I would want to do heals the entire expac. Would you consider priest healing fun?
---
I'm never going back. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO BACK.  God damn Charlie in every village and every dirty fucking hole in the ground.  I did my time.  *I did my time....*
---
Pretty par for the course honestly.
---
Retail. Starting it soon. In classic I know I won’t have the time to do it past just doing classic lol
---
I welcome all the downvotes. I shall be a god among noobs come Classic launch if this sub is any indication, makes me want to play any more. 
---
Depends how many years we have Classic for :p
---
Warriors can use it too... anyone using crescent staff can benefit.  Hunters!
---
The set for real though has agil, stam, spirit.. All fine stats for a warrior while leveling.  Agility = crits = bonus rage.  Spirit can be OP if you have some on msot pieces of your gear, in between mobs hp regen is ridiculous
---
Well no matter what class you pick, there is still the skill, gear and consumable aspect of it.
---
who say that mage or lock is bis in your hands ?
---
Not really. Interaction on the Internet is generally either “fuck you you’re wrong” or “yay we agree hype bro hype.”

[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo) this is the standard elemental build all pvpers use. If you play a lot of BGs elemental mastery instead of NS is probably better. But I personally would go with NS for overall pvp
---
god damn we are bored in this sub 
---
Why is it that Tauren males are always bros? My theory is because the slow running animation supposely causes you to relax too and you are not in the fastfast ogog mode.
---
OP you nearly murdered me! I came very close to choking to death laughing at this, very well done!
---
These are gorgeous. Good Job
---
Can you show me, say, 10 comments, in the last week on r/wow that prove that?
---
If you can, could you also find maybe 2-3 OPs there, that are at 10 or higher karma, that bash classic from the past month?
---
R/WoW has a lot more traffic than this subreddit. I can easily find the inverse those data points here. Fuck I can probably find the 10 comments bashing Retail in this thread alone. 
---
But please. Let me know if you can find that, in that sub. Because despite subbing there, and here, I don’t ever see those OPs myself, on the retail subreddit. But I do see the ones bashing Retail here, constantly.
---
So, again, I don’t agree. The number of retail fans that want classic to fail are maybe 1/10th as numerous and at best 1/50th as loud, as the classic fans that *hate* retail and slam it at every opportunity.

In my recent experience, questing gives you the opportunity to waste upwards of 50% of your time getting ganked once you enter contested zones. Grinding an off the beaten path area out of the way gives you the opportunity to progress your xp bar much faster.

---
I feel like OP thinks that everyone here is clinically retarded or has been in a coma since vanilla and is only now regaining critical function. If we're all subbed to the classic WoW subreddit, we're going to know what all of these are. I like the illustrations and they're fun, but seriously with these titles.

Dammit this picture just camped my corpse for an hour 
---
No it was party only which made feral that much worse of a choice in raids.
---
They are all really good at just about every form of PvP.  For PvP Orc and Dwarf are BIS for Hunter,  for Lock, Orc and gnome. Mage, Undead and Gnome. 
---
In PVE dmg IF they keep 16 debuffs and itemization mages and locks should be close all of Vanilla. In real vanilla with 8 debuffs Locks didn't catch up until AQ.  Hunters will fall behind after the first couple tiers. Mages are more wanted in 5 mans, but ranged are always wanted more than melee and not hard to get a spot doing any pre raid farming. For a BIS list I would look for DM patch lists as Diremaul is available right away. Ignore any Alterac Valley items as that comes in the BWL patch in Classic atm. As far as PVE rotation mage and lock are both boring in raids but in 5 mans they can be fun.
---
They all farm gold well. Mages level worse on a pvp server as pet classes are just super strong leveling in pvp, but they all have a high quality of life endgame. If you want to see what mage can do in PvP you can youtube search Greatwizard. Mages make for flashy videos like rogues, but that doesn't mean you will enjoy them the most or make them better. Warlocks are more a thinking man's class. They have an absolute ton of abilities and it's less twitch and more puppet master. In group pvp mage is more utility than the other 2. You work on slowing the other team, CCing. 
---
They all require a high skill cap to play well they are all just really different. You know what you like. Go with it. You will get a raid spot on all of them and hunters have utility so they have to be brought. Good hunters, locks and mages all shine and people know who the best ones are.

I like you

Not trolling at all. I wouldn’t be surprised if the people who settle for mediocrity in one thing, settle for mediocrity in many/all aspects of life. I don’t know if that’s true, I just wouldn’t be surprised. I wouldn’t be surprised if the turbo nerds playing 16 hrs/day have no girlfriends. 
---
WHERE IS MANKRIKS WIFE??
---
And why exactly is that the case ? Because opinions that deviate from yours are automatically inferior ? And it's not like the whole PServer, #nochanger, classic purists are not biased in any shape of form.  
---
Not sharing your opinion isn't equal to not being knowledgeable about the topic as well.  
---
I get that bashing games is just annoying, especially when it's a game you like, but a lot of criticism is warranted for classic IMO.  
---
But I don't see it failing, and I'm happy for everyone who wll have a great time.
---
kek
---
I felt the same way, but with the added agony of choosing a paladin to level.
---
looks like quality oc is back on the menu
---
Could you PM me? I'm trying to keep track of people who want to buy it.

---
Not a surprise, the game was made with the 1-59 experience in mind. They didn´t really have a plan what happens then. BC and Northrend used to be a part of that too. They wanted it to be an endless leveling game. 
---
STD, i mean STV
---
He also appears to be hoding a lute, meant for grown men......
---
Is this a joke?
---
If I offered you the choice between a $1,000,000 and $999,999 either option you chose 1% goes to a charity of your choice.
---
Which would you choose?
---
First it only effects your party (5 man) second it only effects physical damage dealers, third there is a crit cap so the more gear your group gets the worse it becomes
---
It’s like 30% move speed with no improvements iirc
---
Rekt me ;_;
---
Yo same!!!! I dug out my old external HDD so I could upload them to Google play music
---
Easiest is probably hunter.
---
Since you’ve got a buddy going warrior though I would consider Druid. Few reasons for this:
---
1. It’s very chill levelling as feral. (If you’re doing a lot of dungeons you can level balance and go healer in dungeons, but I wouldn’t recommend it). 
---
2. You’re the GOAT at warsong gulch.
---
3. At 60 you can spec resto and heal your buddy and you and him will be constantly in demand.
---
To clarify for PvP I mostly mean BGs like WSG, AB and AV! For Raiding I guess it matters most what’s good for Naxx, although will be a long time spent in the earlier Tiers too. 
---
Less mechanics, more prep, more people. I think that's a pretty succint gauge of how it's different, though it depends a lot on which guild you're in.
---
I made the unfortunate choice of levelling balance Druid in original. I wouldn’t recommend it, but it was nice to heal dungeons. My buddy was Druid feral spec and we did have a bunch of fun together. It involved quite a bit of drinking water though which isn’t so fun. It’s doable though.
---
Mostly I’d say stick to feral spec, but you can level balance and heal your buddy in dungeons if you really want.
---
I honestly can't tell if that guy is taking the piss or not. Its such a ridiculous claim and high horse that it has to be a troll.
---
i messaged you my discord name
---
I suffered from altoholism in vanilla so I'm committing to one character. 
---
Druids are more fun than you think. Hunter is easy, and I played shaman to 30 and enjoyed it, and they seemed good in PvP.
---
Make this an addon please :)
---
I would like to have full sized map done in this style in my living room it looks amazing
---
Depending on how all these differences pan out, Classic wow raids might be a lot harder than Private servers make them out to be.
---
Less world buffs
---
Less flasks
---
Casters might do less damage
---
Bosses might do more damage
---
Bosses might be harder to kill/more armor
---
Bosses will have better scripted/correct value spells and abilities
---
Coordinating 40 normies in a raid might be impossible
---
Hoping raids aren't going to the walk in the park people are afraid they will be!
---
That's easy, Dragonblight. 
---
This time i choose rl. Not gonna get too serious in classic.
---
Just keep in mind, Healing Touch is more mana efficient than your other heals. Switching forms eats a lot of mana, and efficiency is key.
---
Let's be real. All specs only became viable in WOTLK.
---
I cant remember anything about dwarfs because I just played horde, but as far as I remember trollish was just straight German with an occasional "man" at the end of the sentence. 
---
It's not often I like artwork that's been posted to Reddit. But this is beautiful
---
STVietnam

I’m fine with opinions that deviate from my own. It’s when people put forward stupid ass opinions that they are inferior. I disagree that their criticisms are warranted. I would say much of the criticism is aimed at systems they don’t understand. I would say classics purists are probably less biased than most retail players. Many either still play or at least played for differing amounts of time past vanilla in retail. I would say the majority of people playing retail today that aren’t in that group probably started in wrath or later. There are of course still many completely biased players as well that and a small group of players still from vanilla that just prefer qol wow.
---
Both have their own Strengths and weaknesses.  Its best to have an open mind.  It's not healthy for either community to say one is bad because I dont like it.  Its seen way to much.  I played from Vanilla through Cata on live and have been playing private 7 or 8 years and I think overall BC is the best version of the game but when I came back for Legion those were easily some of the best dungeons I've ever seen in WoW.
---
Don’t stress over it! It will come in time and you’ll get the opportunity to enjoy it. Patience is the key to everything. In the meantime there’s plenty of things this world offer you to discover.
---
If by Viable you mean taking a raid spot to sit there and consecration without having any enemies attack them, then sure, super viable
---
come on this is too easy
---
This is me, quit towards the end of WOTLK and I'm coming back for classic.
---
So Agillity is the best stat for PVE (or up there with AC and stam at least), but the worst for PVP.  Interesting.
---
Yeah it's pretty toxic for people to split up like that and bash each other. I've seen the same stuff in football. People hating each other because they cheer for the opposite team. Sometimes they were beating each other. It's what drove me away from sports. It's a really unhealthy way to live a life. But hey, maybe that's just me.
---
I dream for gaming communities that respect each others opinions. But that's never gonna happen... at least not in my lifetime.
---
10% cringy
---
30% juvenile
---
60% wholesome
---
...
---
I'm 100% on board
---
I've always played Shaman (and now, Druid). They don't even feel like a real class until level 40. I think you need to get to max level to enjoy them.
---
Finally a video that doesn't repeat what everyone else is talking about. Very unique video with important information.
---
Even though pots overall will be much more rare and MUCH more expensive, top guilds will still run the show and camp the black lotus spots 24/7. What's interesting about this though is that every guild under them will have to raid without BiS pots a majority of the time, that alone will make raiding so much harder compared to private servers where everyone has every buff and are completely potted up. Not to mention the boss, items and character stats that will be different which will make raiding harder aswell.
---
I can't wait to find out how different classic WoW will be to vanilla private servers. A new meta will be created
---
female night elf shouldnt be a girl
---
Every Guild I've ever joined save one was like this.  I don't think you'll find an issue with getting others to join your guild as a whole but you need to invest time and effort into establishing and maintaining it...
---
Most people are looking for an active guild that has an active and fun Guild chat and to have that you have to have a guild with many quality people in it.  As others have mentioned you will find that there will be people who will leave consistently to join other prospects that they deem to have more potential or be more aligned with their interests.  Turnover will be high at the beginning, decide on a tentative specific number of total guildmates and make sure you maintain that number if you drop below it.  To combat this turnover you will need to be actively and regularly running dungeons and playing with others to find skilled individuals you'd like to invite.  You will also need a couple of Guild officers who you can trust to be doing the same thing.  You and your officers will need to be careful about who you invite though and how.  For example, I personally never join a guild when I'm invited out of the blue without a word.  I'm also extremely hesitant to join someone's Guild when I've only done up to a single run with them.   It's another story though if that person has been added to my friends list because we have quested and/or run two or three instances and both recognized each other as skilled and friendly players.  Emphasis on the friendly part.  
---
You also have to think about how to retain the player base that you recruit.  There's no need to give away the farm with handouts or people will expect it.  But you should think about helping people with farming or running instances.  If somebody is talking about a quest that they need help with, you and your officers should be among the first to step up and offer a hand.  Always try to involve other guildmates however even when it's just getting people to tag along for whatever you're helping a different Guild mate with.  Once you have a number of people that are like that and it's not just you and your officers doing it your guild won't stagnate while you're offline. 
---
The key is getting people involved and feeling like they're invested in each other.  It's the bonds between the individuals that make people stick around and less guild loyalty.  If you want an example of this just look at most workplaces in real life, how many people stick around at a job they don't like because they like their coworkers.
---
Just don't let things get too clicky; try to keep it in guild chat rather than party chat if appropriate and always involve a variety of people in your events or you'll invite Guild drama.  A feeling of exclusivity theyre not included in leads people to feel alienated.  In the online world where they can avoid conflict people wont outright tell you they're feeling this way they'll just leave.
---
  
---
Hunters have it easier than any other class when trying to gather from nodes that would require pulling 2+ mobs to get to. As another commenter pointed out, I forgot to list feign death too. If a hunter wanted to, they could even bring a pet like a gorilla which has an AoE ability to grab aggro on any monsters that didn't already leave them alone after using feign death. 
---
Hibernate has a cast time and only works on one mob type and only works on one mob at a time. Who has time for that when you may be gathering from hundreds of nodes in a farming session. It also leaving form. Natures grasp has a CD, only one mob at a time and only works outdoors. 
---
You knew your list looked pretty sad compared to a hunter's kit so you listed a potion that hunters can use too and would often cost more than what you're gathering.
---
In a variety of circumstances, a hunter will gather more resources over time than a druid and have an easier time of it.
---
&gt;The number of retail fans that want classic to fail are maybe 1/10th as numerous and at best 1/50th as loud, as the classic fans that hate retail and slam it at every opportunity.
---
That's absolute bullshit. I'm not going to go trawling, the wow forums to make a point any more than you have done.
---
Simply browsing reddit, MMO champ and WoW forums has shown me there is toxic hate on both sides. 
---
People who are unable to see that are usually so single minded that they gloss past the comments that they agree with, and only focus on the ones that trigger them.
---
The people who play classic and people who play retail are the SAME people, they both have formed factions and sling shit at each other. 
---
I would not hold my breath for Cyberpunkt 2077. It does not even have a release year yet.
---
I never saw anyone calling it VC in vanilla either, but they did in later expansions on my server (Darkspear).
---
Bloody hell
---
Not main tank, main character professions.  It doesn't matter what class/role you are, your profession choices rely on other factors IMO.  The reason for this is that you will have alts that can craft things for you.  There are some exceptions like Bloodvine for caster DPS of course.
---
Engineering - Good for every class on your main for PVE and PVP.  This is independent of class role.
---
Enchanting - Allows you to enchant your own BoP gear instead of asking a guildie.  This is an exception to the "your alt can craft/enchant the item for you".  Again this is independent of class role.
---
What considerations should you be making? 
---
 Is your main going to be farming a lot?  If so you should take gathering professions.  When a black lotus spawns right next to you, you want to make sure your farming character is an herbalist.  My farming character is an alt druid, so I don't take gathering professions on my main.  My main is a warlock so I take Tailloring (for Bloodvine) and Engineering (for tanking Twin Emps and overall usefulness).
---
Is your main going to take on the role of crafter in the guild?  Do you want to be the person that gets all the great recipes from raids, but is also required to make stuff for people whenever they want.?  Do you want to try to make money off of things like Lionheart helm?
---
Just think of what your main character is going to be doing at max level and see if any professions scream out to you.
---
I also want full sized for my guest room when you get it done
---
Ah that makes a lot more sense haha. I thought maybe you were one of the first reddit posts 
---
Canada here. Never saw it called VC in vanilla.
---
Thrall’s post picture looks like he’s on a magic mushroom trip. Understandable, though. He probably wants Vanilla more than anyone and the hype is driving him absolutely nuts.
---
Insert "kill me" meme here
---
cannot wait for the full size classic map &lt;3
---
There are some yuge dickheads in the private server community and if you think they are bad on reddit, wait until you run into them in game.  Im excited because a lot of the toxic behaviors rampant on private servers will be mitigated by a genuine retail release.  Im afraid because these behaviors will likely be vented in other unforseen ways.
---
But to stay relevant to the thread; the pserver community has been pood on for years over their preference in play.  Running a server is illegal, so the landscape has been very volatile and most pserver veterans have had farmed 60's on at least 3-5 reputable projects.
---
They are deadly efficient at this brief phase of the game and they now have their permanent home so you better believe they are going to gatekeep.  The problem is this is going to likely translate into a form of elitism not seen since TBC raid attunements or even the birth of gearscore addons.
---
Everybody just needs to stop engaging the conversation of 'which is better' altogether.  Private servers represent the same level of belonging if not more than retail vanilla did at that time.  Criticisms of a classic wow release will always be interpreted as a personal attack by someone in that community.
---
TLDR I hate to sound like a queefy bastard but you people need to learn to get along and agree to disagree.
---
hah unpopular comp so i gotta ask, auchindoun-eu ? 
---
Let's hope it's gonna be like this :) i want the classic experience to last as long as possible !!
---
"swe??"
---
For me Leveling is fun the first time you do it. You get the story and see the events. In both single and multiplayer games you can get deeper into the world though in single player games i may play another play through to get a different experience. I cant really get that in an mmo as much.
---
To elaborate a bit, there is a point where leveling is no longer as fun as it was no matter what class im playing and i just want to get to full power and join the friends i made at end game. One of the key reasons i am excited for Classic, is the ability to meet new people and create that new group and raid friends.  I still know many of the people from my previous time in wow. Though the haters say its all known and and you cant explore it again. Thats a lie, only those that have never started a fresh server will say that. Those are the people that will only know the game as it currently is, guilds all made and a 10 level increase in power.
---
I’m on both subreddits. I read them both actively. It’s adorable how you pretend there is any appreciable hare for classic on r/WoW, when there just isn’t. 
---
Which is why I asked you to find some examples. Since I just don’t see the same level of hatred there. 
---
The toxicity and hate is fairly loud here. It’s nearly nonexistent in r/WoW. 
---
Again though prove me wrong. 
---
MMO-champ is generally the last place the toxic *can* go as it’s a haven for people that get kicked out of places like the official forums and reddit. So it’s not a solid litmus test. 
---
The haste from the Troll racial only benefits Mind Flay in Classic. Mind Blast is already a 1.5s cast and your DoTs are unaffected. Troll racials are a very small damage spike at best. 
---
That said, play what you enjoy and the rest works itself out. I pick Tauren over Orc whenever I have the opportunity. Orc's stun resist might be better in a vacuum, but I like having the extra control offered by War Stomp. I can choose when and where to use it instead of praying for a 25% chance.
---
I think it will be fun to experience the quests without quest helper for a bit, but it does get legitimately tedious after a while. 
---
Decursive was insane.
---
Aw jeez
---
I mean from a theorycrafting perspective. Hunter is what I’ve always played so from a skill perspective that would have an advantage for me personally but if Mage is just outright better then I will learn it. 
---
I want this to be a mod to replace the map in Classic.
---
More like : Fresh 60 vs FULL T3 priest swaglord
---
I love how the moon well in the background looks like a penis.
---
Is nobody going to talk about this?
---
Gosh dang it 
---
I’m hoping they release TBC servers and you can port your existing vanilla 60 over (without losing your vanilla 60). It’ll be interesting to see what path they take and how it will work. I don’t think expansion servers would make it if you have to start over from 1 again. But I also think it would be unfair if you went to move to the expansion server and you lose your original character. I assume it will all be based on player numbers. 
---
Also: I know that your idea is totally different from what I’m talking about but I just really hope they do something with other expansions. 
---
I would assume the full million is a trap and go for the buck less.
---
My first three weeks of Classic will be like this.  
---
Havnt played in years. Stranglethron vale instantly came to mind haha I miss wow
---
Yeah, it blows my mind when people say they're afraid of modern addon, when we had decursive back in the day.
---
Today I learned that dwarfs can play as a bard class in wow. 
---
only acceptable as druid for lore reasons
---
The pre-BG BG
---
I’ll do skinning leather til 60 and then swap to engineering. The second one is up you, it really depends on flavor. Enchanting/herbalism or just keep skinning.
---
This was made in a map creator.

Super easy to do. A very nice tool!
---
When I see two Items on the AH.  The buyout of one is 1 gold 50 silver.  The buyout on the other is 1 gold 48 silver.  I but the 1 gold 50 silver one to not reward undercutting.  Am I too silver poorer? Yes.  Does it matter at all in any possible foreable situation? No.
---
It's a fine spec for content on farm. But you will need that mana tide totem for progression.
---
You mean STVietnam
---
This was made in a map creator.
---
Hey your not the only one. Im playing singler player games like Metro Exodus and Devil May Cry 5 but its hard they are not keeping me. Waiting for Classic is a long process. As for the microtransaction they will not be in at launch but that dont mean it will eventually come in. 
---
Classic WOW is blizzard last chance to keep and get more playerbase for WOW but they screw it up they will lose there playerbase for good. Alot of people WILL NOT RETURN after classic its thats simple. 
---
Except the French. 
---
This is 100% wrong. Night elves are ugly AF and their animations are trash. I mained one in vanilla.
---
Less world buffs? On pservers you have NO world buffs for the first month on each raid, which is where most guilds clear raids. So wrong.
---
Less flasks? People who talk about BL prices back in retail list lower numbers than pservers though?
---
All of this "bosses might do more damage, dps might do less" is pure speculation. The numbers on pservers are inaccurate yes. But that does not necessarily mean they are easier on private servers, it can easily be the exact opposite. Pservers typically try to make raids HARDER, because with current guides technology etc. it's too easy. 
---
Coordinating 40 normies will be easier than it was back in vanilla because we have more communication with others. We can share video, we can constantly talk etc.
---
This video repeats literally everything than people say about pservers though?
---
 I had a single character from Vanilla 2005 through WotLK:  an Undead Warlock.  To my own chagrin, I loved being an Undead Lock.  He brought out the best in me and it never felt old to be Undead.  I was hooked from the moment of being resurrected in a tomb and climbing out into the dark, foreboding village of Brill in a torrential downpour - filled with corrupted zombies to kill.   
---
In fact, I felt disingenuous when I tried to play another character.    
---
While I enjoyed the darkness of the Undead, I was a friendly and dependable player - with a good rep in my guild and on my server.  People would count on my unique Warlock skills: unrelenting DOT-based DPS, live-saving Soul Stones and instantaneously summoning friends from anywhere in the world.   
---
From the cackling laugh and the Heavy Metal head-banging dance, to the hunched-over posture and necrotic skin, to grossing out other group members by feasting off the corpses we left strewn throughout the hallways of a dungeon, I felt like I was a bad-ass - but a good bad-ass!  :-D  
---
And I also absolutely loved my pets.  VW was my faithful buddy who would lay down his life for me.  Succubus was my sexy, mercurial trixter who would seduce humans while I summoned a giant Infernal for them. And my eager little pyro-friend, the Imp, would just blow sh\*t up.    
---
I was an Undead from Brill.  I was a bad-ass Lock.  And I had a bunch of dependable minions.
---
However, since I have RL friends I plan to play with, who may not be on at the same time, I plan to make an alt or two just for them - but not because I want to play alts.
---
As for my next my main, once WoW Classic is out, I'm pondering assuming a new identity.  I'm thinking of a reluctant, old, crotchety Dwarf Priest who will just as soon kick you in the balls as heroically save the entire group from a bad pull. :-D
---
I don't. I can't stand not having all the spells in my toolkit, and the anxiety of falling behind my friends in that we cant do content together.
---
Finally a good video from Tips
---
I have not seen any videos that talks about this personally
---
I did my farming as a full time job. I would have a set routine in silverpine forest and keep to that for 4 to 5 days per week for 2 to 5 hours per time. Fill my bags and make my pots and then sell. I made quite alot of money. There is no quick fix to making gold in WOW, it takes alot of time and effort. 
---
Plug in your mp3 player and drift off when your doing it. The hours go past quickly. And at weekend i would not farm. I would raid and pvp my fun time. Like i said full time job. And this was when i had a real job. 
---
I fully expect Bejeweled to make a roaring comeback.  I also forsee RP servers having much better tools for character backstory and such, which will be mostly a positive.
---
This one fight is really really long even on pservers 
---
&gt; It is impossible to get Verigan's fist and still being ahead of the pack
---
Mostly agree, which is why I also did the math with Orc Crusher, the level 18 quest reward from Redridge.
---
Still viable damage 20-27, and borderline 28-29 for 2.5KPM (2.4 @ 28, still great XPH), and still at 0 downtime for the entirety of 20-30 due to 5SR regen.
---
There's also a dozen + BOE green drops in the 20-30 range that are improvements on the Orc Crusher. Either self found, traded in /1, or nabbed on the AH that lower kill time, so increase downtime between pulls.
---
So kind of a moot point. The 20-30 grind is doable @ 2.5KPH for any weapon with 18DPS, and 12/13 spirit from gear. It's just that more damage = more downtime between pulls for looting, plopping down a campfire and cooking, first aid, etc.
---
And congestion is also a concern. This math is based on my 20-30 routing, and since I've spent a metric ton of time on my 1-10 and 10-20 routes, my 1-20 time is currently 9:04:30, which should be quite a fair bit ahead of the pack. And if any other paladins are lucky to either be a) ahead of the pack or b) in a lull window of other grinders - it still holds up.
---
Thanks!
---
I think blizz killed that addon
---
Lightning mastery is the elemental talent (that and elemental fury), it improves burst and lets you actually get off spells without eye of the storm procs. Losing 10% to heals sucks for PvE but it’s far less noticeable than what you’re losing on the PvP side and if you ever wanna do elemental for PvE it’s a dealbreaker.
---
It could be nerfed come classic.  We won't know until someone tries or they let us know.
---
Looks like your quitting then. Even if blizzard is playing on putting deathknights into Classic down the line it will be YEARS before that happens lol.
---
I'm not sure there's anyone in this sub who doesn't know what zone this is. 
---
I hope the guys at Zygor will release a classic leveling version of their addon. It’s gonna make leveling so much faster.
---
I just love the style of inkarnate... and the best thing is that its free! 
---
The free version has almost no assets for usage unfortunately :/
---
This is why im going to roll PVE server. I can play the game the way i want too.When i choice too PVP i will and not forced too by other people.
---
Yeah i know. I made an map for myself just with the basic stuff... Its good enough to make DnD maps :D
---
I love leveling until about 50. By the time I'm done with Un'Goro it's started to feel like a pretty rugged grind. Scholo, Strath and everything in Blackrock is a blast though, so that helps a bit.
---
Skinners paradise 
---
Definately aint no nostalgia. It’s an really immersive world.  :)
---
I hope they nerf Dire Maul farming. Classic WoW was about going out in the world and fighting over nodes, and not sitting in an instance all day by yourself. It would be dumb if you need to level a hunter alt to not get completely left behind.
---
Not really. I hate playing the game alone so I pretty much require my friends and guild to carry me to 60. Once at cap most content is group content so I prefer it over most of the leveling. 
---
Agreed completely.
---
PM me if you're still interested!
---
I don't remember Ewoks ever being in the game
---
I didn't even have to open this up without knowing its my fav zone.
---
This is a picture of vietnam.
---
You'll understand why you need Storm Reach and Lightning Mastery the first time you step into a BG. 
---
Hi, /u/totzz
---
Yeah, that's what I was fearing. Thank you. 
---
Why are you posting a map of Skyrim in a classic wow sub?
---
Ahh I didn't realize how important lightning mastery is for PvP. 
---
Douse quest for MC as well if you wanna be a chad guildmate 
---
This is a tremendous video and something I've been waiting for for a long time. In some ways, it's self serving for me because I have a particular memory of vanilla wow, however feint, and I feel like theorycrafters and PS players have corrupted that wholesome experience, but in others, its just facts. PS are not classic and people's experiences are going to be different.
---
All that being said, I will say that the fact remains that classic is beatable. None of these changes are going to prevent people from beating raid bosses or reaching high ranks in PvP. Whether raids will be harder or easier is somewhat immaterial given that, through time and effort and the addition of ZG and AQ20, everything up to AQ40 and Naxx is doable without an insane time investment. I think a lot of people are in for a rude awakening though when they get to AQ40 and get wiped off the map due to not having NR gear.

And for what its worth, I used my earth shaker in caster form a lot while PvPing back in the day and that thing almost NEVER proc'd. If I had to estimate, i'd put it around 2-5% at best. Still a fun memelord weapon though.
---
New Tool album this year as well.
---
I appreciate the leveling experience as the time sink connects me to the character.  However, I spend all that time wishing the process was over. The game doesn't feel like it starts until I ding 60.
---
I'm skeptical because isn't this where a large chunk of nefarious activity stems from?  Throw away accounts to mule and sell items, make corpse logos in cities, no repercussion for hacking etc.

I think it comes with just as much bad as it does good.

Yes. Set up priority and then all I do is press “T” and boom.

But if they have 0% crit chance then the math is good , right? If not then csn you please write it down in an equation?

Cant ride mechanostriders though...
---
I do, from making a tough decision. I mostly quit in wotlk, though I barely played early cataclysm, and haven’t played any private servers. I was really excited when I found out about Classic WoW as I had recently looked into the state of retail only to be disgusted. 
---
But what I long most for is BC, with attunements and non-nerfed raids/heroic dungeons. A private BC server with this exact criteria came out a couple months ago, and I was pretty tempted, since even if blizzard does BC, it’ll probably be the end patch nerfed content, with nerfed or nonexistent attunements as well. But when I haven’t played in almost a decade, summer was going to be an amazing experience of reexploration for me, along with a RL friend, and lots of the people I’d be playing with online. If I played on this private server with a bunch of veterans rushing though stuff, just to quit several months down the line for classic, some of the magic would certainly be lost come summer, so I decided to abstain and am impatiently waiting for summer. I also am avoiding trying out vanilla classes at 60 on other private servers even though that might help me decide what I want to play, because I really want everything to feel fresh. Although I am studying/planning things out quite a bit!
---
My older brother got me into WoW when I was 13. Then he quit and mocked me for playing a supposedly newb game and acted like he just wanted to get me to play to see if I actually would, haha.

Addons back in the days were in large more powerful due to the less restricted API. The addons with the biggest potential to impact game experience are those that affect the social &amp; grouping aspect. 
---
Blizzard has said they may restrict the use of such addons if it proves to be a problem.
---
Yeah, I'm sure. I did main a shaman in vanilla and did some ranking in BGs, but I just can't remember important details about mant of aspects of the game.  It was so long ago and I was pretty young, and I'm sure I was a lot more awful than I remember. 
---
&gt; Classic WoW was about going out in the world and fighting over nodes

Pretty sure that's not what Vanilla WoW was about

Slow clap for you man, like I told the other user, the world needs ditch diggers.  Enjoy farming your herbs, when you're done with that you can make me a pair of nikes.  A hunter utilizing their time farming herbs instead of farming Maradon or even earth elementals is a joke.  I'll be logging on every 2 hours on a druid alt for that one 75g black lotus and be done with it.

---
I think raising the level cap is long term a bad idea. But I think later expansions introduced cool systems. Sockets in particular are a way to give "better gear" without it being outright stronger (think TBC quest gear replacing raid gear) and trivializing what youve done. Sockets also offer a "progression" as you can do different socket setups (although RNG here like we have in BFA is a bad idea) and different gems.

---
Anything that removes world buffs and expensive consumables from the meta is a huge plus in my book. They were just an annoyance where you were spending insane amounts of time and gold to make easy raids even easier.
---
I'm hoping this shifts the meta to be less melee heavy, I remember casters being more favored back in the day but part of that could just be due to warriors being horrible at dealing damage prior to AQ so there weren't as many of them.
---
Raiding in vanilla was never really difficult, but I think it was harder than private servers. We got to the four horsemen and couldn't get any further due to lack of tanks but we didn't min/max our consumables or debuffs and at least a quarter of any given raid weren't really especially good at the game. Almost any knucklehead could clear all the content and that's a good thing!
---
Remind me 1 month!
---
Ahhh to silence, put dot on rogue from vanishing, and slow if low on mana and not worried about damage?
---
Got a job?  You gotta quit that shit, time spent working is time you're not playing WoW.  GF?  Wrong answer, lose her.  You have yourself a shit bucket?  Any time you spend in the bathroom is time you aren't playing WoW.
---
Guess you missed all of the old PvP videos of people fighting over Thorium veins in Searing Gorge then
---
I’ve done the same with not playing on any private servers. It’s felt like forever ago when they announced that vanilla was coming back, and it’s been hell just sitting around waiting. I started playing wow just because I wanted to annoy my brother and make him share the computer, but then I ended up becoming fully invested and loved wow so much

I got into WoW through playing EQ.  I struggled through EQ for 3-4 years before WoW came out. The experience with EQ was awesome and I made a lot of memories, but WoW came out at a time when EQ began to lose a lot of its magic and people began a mass exodus from EQ to WoW. Population dropped dramatically, all content in EQ was increasingly geared toward to hardcore raiders (I raided but couldn't keep up with the best because I was 13 at the time and EQ was a tough game), and just became increasingly inaccessible to me.  
---
So I tried WoW.  I really fell in love with WoW.  I remember feeling a little turned off at first by the more "cartoony" feel of WoW (I was a super cool EQ player after all), but I got used to it and remember easily, but not too easily, questing through Mulgore on my Tauren Shaman. I couldn't put it down!  It was so accessible, but also challenging to a point where it wasn't boring. 
---
However, by the time BC came out I was spending more time with friends and my play times weren't 15 to 18 hours a day through the summers anymore.  I still raided and PvP'd, but progressed more slowly through whatever I was doing in BC.  When WoTLK came out, it started to feel like EQ all over again.  It was another expense, the game kept expanding faster than I wanted to keep up, and I began to feel alienated.  I didn't like the concept of the death knight, and RL was much more interesting than trying to keep up with unending expansions that conjured up bad memories of EQ.  I was in my senior year of high school by that time, had a car, was partying way harder than I should have been, and I was much more interested in girls than WoW by that time. So, that's how I quit. 
---
Yeah I do see what you’re saying and I do agree it sounds like a good idea. I think people won’t be happy though without the reward of leveling up as they move through new content. I think most people in this sub would be fine but the general population may not and that’s who blizzard caters to. It would be nice to see them do a different spin on releasing all the content like that and the main reason I would like TBC would be the introduction of arena but if they even did that differently it would be interesting. Unfortunately I’ve lost a lot of creative faith in blizzard(activision) but I’ll be happy to be proved wrong.

Yeah can you imagine healing MC for 3 hours and losing tier pieces to Ret paladins. Gunna be a no from me lol 
---
From my theorycrafting perspective: Mage life is wonderful in vanilla Lock is fun, but you kinda feel like a bitch sometimes, when you have to farm 40+ shards before the raid. And Hunter is fun but they fall of in damage.
---
As to what is BiS, im not sure BiS is the right word for vanilla, everyclass has its usefulness. And at the end of the day, its comes down to otherthings than just what class.
---
Caaaaaaaaaaaake
---
Oh cool, I didn't notice
---
its supposed to come out this summer lol
---
Another thing that I have noticed is different on private servers is that for some reason Will of the Forsaken is not breaking polymorph 
---
It's been a thing for the past 15 years and hasn't been much of a concern outside of random PVP complaints.
---
&gt;Basically turning weapon farms, exotic crafting ingredients etc on lockdown.
---
How so? Loot's not shared. If I go to Silithus with 1 character, I can farm 30 mining nodes an hour and get 5 arcane crystals. If I go to Silithus with 5 characters, I can farm 30 mining nodes an hour and get 5 arcane crystals. No big diff.

Money is what mostly keeps this in check on retail. You want 5 boomkins who can all assist train with a single key? Prepare to spend $75/mo for it. Sure it will probably still exist but it won't the the problem that it could be on f2p private servers.
---
Tips is a joke 🙃🔫
---

---
wtf
---
Do you have a source for that? I was actually looking for one yesterday and the closest I could get was that some “feel” it would come out 2019 or early 2020.
---
I don’t know how I’m going to live without Luna tbh
---
And the larger amount of non conflicts on PVE servers that had no videos because we're civilized?
---
Feels like reading Barrens chat already.
---
Don't underestimate the passion of the OGs who discovered WoW at release. You can't just say thousands of people you didn't know sucked. A lot of your private server people might be in for a rude awakening yourselves. I knew an orc that got pretty high stun resistance though because of the trinkets rogues hated him. The tauren was just the best warrior due to pocket healers, and high warlord but I even remember seeing him in blues utilizing engineering like crazy and just stance dancing fast as all hell. I was proud to be a bull watching that outside of razor hill
---
Hoping we get a lot info by the end of the month. We need definitive statements on loot trading, sharding, timeline, progressive itemization, etc. 
---
this, and if there are people that actually wanna do that then blizz is not gonna do something about it since they make  $75/mo from one guy
---
It is more about mana pool when it comes to healing dungeons as you level.  The problem with feral is that all your gear has agility and stamina on it.  Keep an INT set of gear and you'll be fine.
---
Oh the days of the booty bay fishing contest. Fun times they were.
---
It was planned all this time, well played blizzard.
---
Literally a dude in two posts above this one, claiming when classic drops pserver hardcore players will be as good as new ones since its a completely different game apparently
---
Never did the hole but I did get under orgrimmar one time. That was a scary experience. Thought I was never getting out.
---
LOL, this is pretty accurate
---
Ikr?! The utter madlads are going to release the best WoW with new feautures but no expansions. This day was fortold by the great Gaben himself so it seems. May Metzens grizzled beard and musky scent bless this new child as it enters into the world...of warcraft
---
Not every server will have one of those guilds though, as a matter of fact I'd guess that most won't. 
---
What is the criteria for lower-tier PvE being irrelevant? Please help me understand, because it sounds as if non-BIS rewards are relevant in one &amp; irrelevant in another, and I don't follow the distinction.
---
Then Dire Maul farming being nerfed is still good for you because it causes extreme price inflation 
---
that disagree about leveling. It's a progression system, and not all progression systems are infinitely good. I think 1-60 facilitates what it needs to. Past that, we are going to have to look to alternate progression systems. But I think there's already already viable "end game" progression systems in retail
---
1) gear sockets.  
---
2) reputation.  
---
3) artifact weapons (this might be better as a more limited system, and not heavily lore-unique weapons like Ashbringer). Maybe instead of weapons, it could be class specific slots. This also expands class fantasy. 
---
People might disagree but there is only undead warlock for me, cuz really... demons and sh*t
---
One of the things that actually drew me towards WoW before I'd ever played it, was being fascinated seeing players with as many buttons as this - and knowing exactly what each one of them did.
---
Cmon, next you'll criticize scripts that automatically choose your healing spell rank based on target's missing HP! Ludicrous 
---
Could someone let me in on how is this warlock horse summoning money saving technique works? Never heard this before.
---
The game is always fun to me when there is no pressure so I tended to like levelling and farming, just put on some music and escape for a while.
---
Well back then you could not /reset an instance while already inside it, and camping out did not put you to start of the instance, but just logged you out where you sat.
---
What made you go back to start of the dungeon was if the instance autoresetted while you where offline.
---
This was also why hunter grabbed disenchanting when farming mara, because they did 1 run, HS back to desolace, and ran it again. and then it was that. So they would get more value from it.
---
Lol, look at you, why did i bother trying to argue haha. You have a nice day now. Hope you feel better
---
Good job
---
&gt; just put on some music
---
How can you put some music when you have WoW's soundtrack?
---
Just joking, but the soundtrack is really a masterpiece, it's perfect for leveling and for reviving the nostalgia.
---
Not the same obviously, but you can look it from a different angle and appreciate the things that can't be found in today's games (a challenge, that is).
---
I second this.
---
I prefer endgame because I have no friends...
---
The good thing about classic is that you can make new friends :)
---
Most of my in-game friends I met them while I was leveling.
---
But if a guy had five toons he can camp the spawns and farms. Makes it difficult but I get your point. I’m just so hopefully for classic and it scares me lol 
---
I've PM'd you. This is a great idea. 
---
Man, if I were a dominatrix or something I'd really be getting off to all the people squirming with want and anticipation on this sub. This is bordering on kink.
---
Heh, it's why I'll be playing itttt
---
Must have been after my time.  I do recall blackjack and stuff.  I don't know how to play but that might make me learn.  Hopefully there's something fun to do between pulls and waiting for spawns.
---
Yeah I mean vanilla had some addons like a threat meter or ones that made it easier to read boss emotes. Were addons that showed boss cooldowns in vanilla already? I honestly don't remember. I know you couldn't do half the stuff you can do now though.
---
When I was playing in BFA, I was literally upsetting people in parties because I told them I don't like to use alert addons, and almost got kicked as a healer because I didn't know about some fear mechanic the first time I saw it. Of course everyone else knew though because they used an addon that told them however many seconds ahead of time to get behind cover to avoid the fear. At that moment my drive to keep playing was done because I knew if it was like this in a normal 5 man dungeon, it was going to be worse later. I quit playing at 119.
---
Last time I raided was in Legion with a pretty average guild that didn't take things so serious. But even in our very first raid as a guild that expansion, everyone was required to have the typical addons installed like bigwigs and other addons that warned of mechanics. I never did mythics because I know it would have been even more reliant on addons or else you'd frustrate people for not using them. A lot of people in my guild even had an addon that literally tells them what button to push to maximize dps rotations. And it actually helped them. 
---
So yeah, people do like the easy way because why wouldn't you if the option is available? Most people don't want to gimp themselves if everyone else is doing the easy way. The problem to me, is retail facilitates too much of the "But what is the best option?" mentality and less invoking players to try things out themselves to get to the point where they are good. They wan't instant results. The players are partly to blame to enforce others to conform to it, but imo lots of these addons just shouldn't exist. To me it's obviously a better experience taking out a boss after you used trial, error and experience to win rather than study a youtube video, copy someones spec and gear, and follow orders from an addon. Some of this happened anyway since vanilla but that was their way of playing. Now in retail, it's encouraged at nearly every level to use excessive amounts of addons for everything. Why can't the game just be the game, and addons work to create a better custom UI, not change the way the game is played? I'm sure bosses today in retail are balanced around the fact, blizz knows people are using addons.
---
Sorry for the rant, I just can't wait to play vanilla again :P
---
Heh, it's why I'll be playing itttt.
---
I'm concerned too, Activision are greedy fucks and don't ban multiboxers while private servers generally always do. Multiboxers can single-handly ruin vanilla for a lot of people.
---
No laxative can dislodge the amount of shit OP is full of.
---
Second monitor is in your future son
---
I never played classic, but from what I've read hunters are one of the hardest classes in classic in both pvp/pve. Kiting, deadzone, trinket swapping and one of the more complex rotations.
---
&gt;  hasn't been much of a concern outside of random PVP complaints.
---
You mean something that happens a LOT in Vanilla due to the world being very relevant at level cap and no sharding/cross server? Yeah. multiboxers will NEED to be banned in Classic or can ruin the game for tons of people.
---
In my research to find my main for classic I have read everywhere that hunters are one of the harder classes in both pvp/pve. Kiting, deadzone, trinket swapping and one of the more complex rotations.
---
okay, lets take the weird situation that you have 40 Identical Melee in a raid, and a druid aura affects 40 people instead of only 5.  And you want to know the chance of AT LEAST ONE person scoring a crit during a period where all 40 attack at once...
---
SO you have 40 attacks happening at once. The chance of at least one crit is dependant on the crit chance of each. For 0% obviously there's 0% chance.
---
For an "at least one attack crits" result, you basically have 40 attempts to roll the dice to see if you get a crit. 1% crit chance, and ANY of them can be a crit to satisfy your result. The way you work this out is take the one single result where all 40 attacks DONT crit, see the percentage chance of that, and then the chance for at least one crit is 100% minus that result. 
---
For 1% crit, you have 99% chance to not crit, which is 0.99. For two people, the chance of no crits is 0.99 x 0.99. For three people, the chance of no crits is 0.99 x 0.99 x 0.99 so the chance of no crits at all for 40 people attacking at once with 1% crit chance each is 0.99 to the power 40, which is 0.669. 
---
This makes sense - 0.669 is 66.9%, so there's a 66.9% chance that noone will crit, and thus a 43.1% chance that at least one person will crit, assuming 40 rolls to crit of 1%.
---
For 2% this becomes 0.98 to the power 40, which is 0.446, so its 65.4% chance that at least one person will crit with a 2% chance... for a 3% chance to crit means there's a 70.4% chance that at least one of those 40 will be a crit. 
---
I guess in a sense, going from 0% chance to crit to 70.4% chance via adding a 3% aura is CLOSE to what you said, but not exact, and it's a weird calc.
---
Now consider the default crit chance of your average melee person might be 15%.
---
0.85 to the power 40 is 0.0015, which means 0.15% chance that noone at all gets a crit in 40 attacks. Less than 1%. 
---
This is why the question is kind of pointless... it just doesnt mean anything because if 40 people with "average" crit chances attack all at once, you have a 99.85% chance that at least one of them scores a crit each attack. Adding 3% to their crit chance wont really be noticeable if this is the measure you're using for effectiveness.
---
I wouldnt use the math as a justification for Ferals in raids personally.
---
I can't believe I just typed all that out.
---
In in your classic server, boxing your multi.
---
That's roughly correct as being conservative is closer to reality. 
---
Taking the red pill means "awakening" to the constructs of society and seeing what was fake in your life. Just like in the matrix movie. He finds out his whole life was a lie, and can never go back. 
---
Anything can be called a redpill because it basically means being educated on a subject. A good example is the men's rights movement, a feminist quit the toxic label after studying the statistics and interviewing people on both sides. Her documentary was called the red pill and the cover is her falling down the rabit hole.
---
Wrath added catch up gear and LFD.
---
doubt you'll even get to 60 no offense
---
Hopefully positively. Too many addons in vanilla I've seen on private servers require none or very minimal interaction and it's total automation. I'd much rather have addons that convey information better than addons that allow you to do nothing whatsoever. 
---
LFD was an improvement to Wrath IMO - but that's partially my fault because I pugged a lot in Wrath. Yelling for hours in trade for a tank only to get to the dungeon and have them leave got old fast.
---
I really considered a warlock this time around. The main factors preventing me from going in that direction is lack of mobility pre-40 and soul shards. 
---
Travel time is such a big deal, and pre-40 warlocks have a disturbing lack of mobility.  This would be a huge deal if my competing main choices didn't have mobility spells, but ghost wolf on a shaman and blink on a mage really helped tip the scale for me. I'm sure that seems petty and insignificant to some people, but meh. 
---
Soul shards kind of put me off too. My raiding schedule is so tight that I don't think I could pull off 20 or more minutes of soul shard farming before weekday raids. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't disappear when you logged, but that simple design aspect kind of killed it for me. 
---
I still really love warlocks and will alt one for sure at some point, but the first few months I'm going to bar myself from alting too hard. 
---
Yeah if you like being ganked while ganking gankers who are ganking some guy killing cats.
---
Rogue is the 2ND best dps in the game. Has tons of cool moves and useful specs. I can't believe people are trying to say Rogues aren't worth it because they are like wimpy warriors? Too much Warrior knob polishing around here. Rogues are sick.
---
If all these Pserver fanboys had their way the entire game would just be Warriors and healers.
---
Why would you think that? It’s not that hard as people make it out to be and it doesn’t take that long either. 
---
 
---
This is totally wrong...Rogues are great at leveling. 
---
For me it's immersion breaking and clearly a pay to win advantage.  Blizzard doesn't agree though I guess.  I'm going to pay for several accounts because my family will play.  I could multibox I suppose but it seems wrong.
---
It would be much more of a problem on TBC than Vanilla. The problem class will be ele shaman because of chain heal, firenova totem all at the same time to smoke melee and chain lightning. Why it won't be a big problem in Vanilla is 
---
1) Elemental has no pvp set to grind. You have to heal to get elemental gear in raids. This means they have to use a worse spec for it like shadow priest which has shorter range, can't heal the same, would require different keybinds for each fear to be efficient. I expect a few of these losers will show up on popular streamer servers to be seen but streamer servers are going to be screwed anyways.
---
2) AV was the biggest problem and old AV has lots of NPC's and bombs and stuff that splits up the action. If they use the new trash AV then it would be much easier. The other BG's mulitboxing really doesn't matter. You can have the 5 greatest players in the world in AB zerging around and still lose. WSG has a ton of line of site which makes multiboxing not ideal. 
---
TBC also had a stupid one button macro BM rotation and BM was decent. People usually played ele/hunter that I can remember in Arena to get decent gear with their multiboxing. 
---
AV is total trash in TBC anyways so it really doesn't even matter. BG's became pointless the day Arena came out. 
---

---
Pretty much any classic AC/DC song
---
- discovered rock and roll and classic wow at the same time
---
I'm hopeful that proper raid boss mechanics will push raid comps away from stacking melee to more ranged as well. One of the reasons I remember for raid comps liking ranged was that it was a massive load on the healers just to keep the melee up quite often. Melee dps was dominant, but there were only so many you could stack so even though classes like hunters weren't scaling up their damage as fast, you still valued them for their self-sufficiency.

Hi, /u/reccos77
---
Just to add on, recent pservers add an insane amount of custom armor to curb mdps. I genuinely think pserver bosses will be harder than classic
---
Aren’t you positioning yourself against people who position themselves...
---
This is false... You leave instance - invite a player - convert to raid(maybe needed?) - kick the normie - the 5 man is now reset.
---
Source: Mage that power leveled and sold runs of instances in vanilla not PS.
---
The leveling starts downloading the game on a dial up line !

Go back to retail 
---
Context please? I play to smash mobs and get loot, so I’ve missed out on lore
---
It is unfair. Yeah. Blizzard is more then happy to make 5x the income though. If I had the patience to do it, I would. 
---
Guarantee someone will be multi-boxing 40 accounts and try soloing raids. Would like to see a video of someone attempting to solo all the raiding content with their multibox.

Chromie is a bronze dragon and time travels. So her asking us if we're from the future when we're playing the game as it was 15 years ago is kinda cool.
---
Awesome video! There's nothing wrong with long videos like then when you have the actual content to talk about, and this video delivered. Would love to hear even more on this topic.
---
Particularly, you went into details about the unknowns around armor mechanics, but did the Nost dev you spoke with have any comments on threat mechanics?

If you make a full map like this, I would love to purchase 2

And really weird sometimes, like the random tavern theme that starts playing in MC. 
---
when is classic wows release
---
its free to use at inkarnate.com    an even better similar version over at r/wonderdraft
---
Yeah, leveling is pretty much what I play for along with character fantasy.
---
Because it's an IP that people hold dear to their heart, being squeezed for every ounce of money that acti blizz can. It's more than a game for most people, it's a story and world that people legitimately care about,  which is where the abuse bit comes in
---
As for you hand waving this away because "toxicity".. go get bent. You know my argument very well, and how people feel about it. Stop blabbering about other people being toxic and take a damn look in the mirror every now and then
---
Just FYI unless you are using the paid version of inkarnate you aren't supposed to use it for profit 
---
go to inkarnate.com there are tons of sample arts much more well done of WoW lands, GoT lands, etc. 
---
Yea, people really aren't accounting for the fact that WoW Classic is a "discovered" game. Mechanics, farming, class knowledge... it's all far greater than when we experienced vanilla. I really don't foresee Classic being difficult at all. I *hope* they change some things to make that happen but I'm sure all the hardcore classic whiners will be against that.
---
This is a great video with new content. Don't be stupid.
---
Check out Wonderdraft, it's the newest, coolest hip and rad map creator

 there were no worldbuff cooldowns in classic .. wtf? where he got this from? sure as hell not from his own exp

armour has been additive in classic too, anything else would make  absolutly no sense

. wtf this vid is full of wrong information; its  pathetic  ok ive quit the vid at [10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYepdsfid4w&amp;t=600s) when he tells us he still doesnt even know how resistances work .. wow classic content creator? just wow﻿.. this dude has no clue what he is talking about

Sorry, I couldn't find them among all of the raiding videos

Blink rarely works correctly. I've seen it implemented in many different ways and I don't remember how it actually worked in Vanilla.
---
Removed per rule 1. 
---
But.. no changes..
---
Removed per rule 7. 
---
wotf never worked against sheep in classic
---
&gt;  just wow﻿.. this dude has no clue what he is talking about
---
You do realize that this is not his information, but information that Nost devs that he is passing on?
---
So you think Nost devs don't know what they're talking about?
---
&gt;PS are not classic and people's experiences are going to be different.
---
Keep in mind that Classic won't be vanilla.
---
Yeah it does. It increase "ranged attack speed by 10%". So a Priest and Warlock can actually use a wand when bagspace not is an issue.

Do this for tier 1 and 2 and farm BIS before that as full resto. Switch to Resto again in AQ.

Guilds need melee group shamans to cast chain heal and drop totems because there are so many rogues and fury warriors. You cheal heal for a  whole 10 percent less and this still has the armor buff. Just be smart with gearing maybe use some consumables and you will easily pull your weight. When AV comes out you go get that dumb flower offhand etc.
---
Tier 1 and 2 are heavily nerfed compared to real Vanilla due to 1.12 talents, debuffs, itemization, Diremaul gear at launch with has baller mp5 trinkets. All this could change prior to release but even with just 1.12 talents you can get away with not using mana tide in a middle progress guild. There is no race on a ele Shaman and it's honestly best to be in a middle progress guild. Best Ele gear is in AQ and if PVP is more important to you just stomp people once you get AQ gear and take an alt to Naxx. Mage makes a nice alt. Give them bloodvine when it comes out and you will do great dps very quickly. You will always have water before then to. Give it to some noob when he asks for free food tell him to hold it and pick it up. Level the mage with only rest XP and aoe grinding once the initial zerg is done. 
---
That's the best way I found to have a good high quality of life on a Ele Shaman anyways. Let some other sucker raid Naxx on their shaman to get a slightly better shield and a heal set. Weapon isn't even a big deal on a shaman btw. In 1 v 1's the garbage dagger from ZG is actually better than slow weapons with crazy spellpower. Reason is because with searing totem and it you make life hell for a caster and you should have /startattacks on all your spells. You can put a stop on the iron grenade.
---
Where are his sources? Hes saying ALOT of very controversial stuff. 
---
I have the premium version. Np.
---
The question is. Will a Multiboxer with 5 characters have an advantage over 5 players with 1 character?
---
Removed per rule 7. This isn't proof of anything. Additionally, this is obvious private server footage which is enough to get you banned. Do not intentionally post misinformation. 
---
Shadow priests have excellent excellent PVE damage, they just run OOM.  Unlike Elemental Shamans and Boomkins, Shadow priests can potentially maintain their mana throughout most fights if they farm a ton of consumables.  Major Mana and Dark Runes on cooldown.  Bribe a druid for innervate.  Nightfin soup and all the other mp5 consumables.
---
The ones that make their mana last do great.  Doesn't take long of wanding for you DPS to drop like a brick though.
---
My big brother had a pretty weird taste in music. I listened to his playlist (burned CDs lol) which included Forever Young and The Voice of Enigma.
---
The vanilla expert TipsOut specifically said it does though, are you telling me he doesn't know what he is talking about?
---
&gt;since even if blizzard does BC, it’ll probably be the end patch nerfed content, with nerfed or nonexistent attunements as well.
---
This assumption is 100% incorrect. During Blizzcon, the developers helped explain the driving forces behind why Classic is going to be in a perpetual 1.12 state with staggered content release. Blizzard did not keep an accurate changelog throughout the entirety of vanilla's commercial lifespan. The developers wrote over the old code and did not leave any retrievable data history to be able to go back to view previous iterations of code. The reason we have Classic in development is because they found a store of 1.12 data. They did not find the exact data for each patch from 1.1-1.12. This means NO ONE knows EXACTLY what changes happened at each patch. This means a 1.1-1.12 patch progression for Classic could in no way be an authentic vanilla experience. Now why does this apply to BC? We dont know if they stored the data for each individual patch for BC. If those data stores exist, logically speaking, we are more likely to get an exact replica of how BC existed, than to get an end game static balance experience. 1.12 for Vanilla was not a design decision, it was the basis of the entire design concept because it is the only retrievable cornerstone of authentic vanilla code. 
---
That's Vietnam circa 1967
---
Still watching vid. 
---
One of my big hopes for Classic is that it's harder than private servers. 
---
Senses fail, some songs because of laintime.
---
&gt; Blizzard has to be aware of this right?
---
They approve of that, cuz it brings them more sub money.
---
As others said decursive is worse than anything now. Deadly boss mods won't mean much because threat is the "mechanic" in WoW and managing mana on healers.
---
The only addon I have seen that might be bad is that "spy" that announces to zones player locations in coordinates. 
---
People complaining about quest addons lived under a rock. We were using leveling guides way back then alt tabbing out. All it means is people will probably have a better leveling experience and do less grinding mobs and see more lore. They will probably have a BETTER time.
---
It’s like a Shaman’s lightning shield troll priests get. It can proc blackout. And that’s why it’s useful. 
---
Furyswipes on YouTube multiboxes whole raids with 20/40 characters, but it relies on the open API of Vanilla, which we aren’t getting.  The big challenge is intelligent healing.  Pretty easy to do with 5-10 characters, but gets out of hand on more than that, but then you have fights like Razorgore which require a lot of individual attention.  
---
Ungoro crater
---
When is it optimal not to use max rank for that? 
---
Im in no way a pvp pro, I could keybind that but I have never thought of any reason why.
---
Yeah, it's really sad how Blizzard agrees and allows it just because money is involved... It's a very anti-consumer standpoint and who knows what they will pull apart from this...
---
Yay for muse! For me it's PiB because of Drakedog quit video 
---
Appreciate the response mate, ill keep this in mind!
---
Lol that's Limited Invulnerability Potion ;)
---
&gt; why did i bother trying to argue
---
Because you're probably autistic.  It's the only reason someone would create a selfpost *I think hunters are the best gatherers by a long shot.* and then attempt to seriously start a dialog over something so trivial.  
---
There's also some spell power on that gear iirc, which would mostly affect arcane shot. Seems like the devs were going for something there but kinda half baked it. 
---
So this was OG WoW eh? I missed Vanilla, came in when BC launched.
---
EU. I've been thinking about creating a discord, might just do it. Ill send you a link if i do!

WoF is always good of course but I think devouring plague is a bit overrated. The Mana cost is completely insane.

Depends on what node respawns look like.  EPL was my mine of choice back in the day, and I could make a round through a bunch of Large Thorium Veins with an epic mount without too much trouble.  If you can cut down on travel time, you can essentially Jack the nodes every respawn.  Requires 5 miners though, and even then I think I’d rather have spent the time farming an instance if I were boxing over trying to camp stuff out in the world.
---
I always ban that little twat in HotS. 
---
1. No. Neither does expose armour.  
---
2. Yes, it lets you skin the beast and core hounds.  
---
3. Yes, although it often doesn't work.

Finkle's skinner is needed to skin onyxia, in combination with an enchant.

Quest Sharing will probably be a thing as long as the party member is within your vicinity.

---
I don't remember this thing being a thing in Vanilla. Are you sure it's not a private server thing?
---
Did it have the TBC quest values? Quest xp wasn't enough in Vanilla to hit 60, you needed to spend time grinding out levels even with quests done. You also get less XP from a mob if others kill it for you IIRC.

Now do a mspaint.exe version

Thanks dude. Now I understand

July is so far away :(
---
Damn. This guy has an insane set-up. Insane keybinds. Insane raid knowledge.
---
They're mediumly difficult in PvP from what I remember. Not hard in PvE in my experience, and a breeze to level. You don't really need to kite since you've got a pet. As far as I can recall mages are the only classes that need to kite in PvE (note: although I was a stupid kid and leveled my mage "Fizdawiz" to 60 without kiting, but apparently most mages kited). Between druid, mage, and hunter (and also a warlock to level 40 but I dunno if that counts for anything), I found hunter to be the easiest of those, but Druid to be the most fun. 
---
LOL, this is a real non ironic "In vanilla i was rank 14 and cleared naxx" that people joke about. That's great, thanks for the laugh man
---
Leveling and the first few months of pre raid gearing are the best part of every wow character. Once you reach endgame you're raid logging twice a week or grinding the honor system. 
---
But I've read many times here that private servers are near perfect to recreating vanilla
---
Cool video. Black Lotus comes randomly from other nodes too. The static spawns were always really rare. A big change for sure, but flasks were still very prevalent in vanilla WoW.
---
Does expose armor stack with sunder on private servers? That's a pretty big mistake...anyone who played classic knows a warrior can't sunder if expose is up.
---
Duplicate weapon drops from bosses? I don't remember seeing that in vanilla so it seems to check out.
---
pls show me the nost staff statement that sais there has been a 12h cd on rend buff they didnt implement correctly Oo

You can damage yourself with consumables to get more berserking value.

Truth. Ironically, Classic wow will be by far more similar to a private server experience than vanilla in 2004-2006. Because both are based on 1.12 whereas 2004-2006 actually went through all of those massive patches to the game. No other expansion had such extensive patches as vanilla. No other expansion had as massive class reworks and balances and even game changing mechanics and formula changes ALL of which happened DURING that same expansion time period.
---
I was a powerleveller in Vanilla when it was retail, I did about a dozen speedruns to 60 (these are 150+ hours each, so I spent over 2000 hours doing it). 7 days /played on most classes is really quick. The big thing you need to realise is that quest xp is lower than most pserver values. You also run out of efficient quests and your best bet is often to stay in place and grind mobs for a few hours.
---
Absolutely, although I also wasn't huge into raiding during classic when I played. 
---
2. Also Onyxia
---
i totally get you. hate playing with german clans. they are always so serious. have no Sense of Humor. and even though well Organized and disciplined they are never the Top Players.

Damn if Fishing is actually pretty lucrative I’m gonna have to check it out in Classic

This.  If I have a complaint about current WoW at all it’s that the zone levels with you. Part of the fun was traveling zone to zone to level, getting ganked along the way, booking it through zones that were way too high level for you. The nostalgia

When you count in the Black Lotus spawn rate of 2 hrs in 1.12.1, the non-stacking armor debuffs (on private servers the raid bosses basically take 100% physical damage), the spell damage dealt and received in 1.12.1, the world buffs...well, pretty much all the "meta" from private servers goes belly up.
---
Fury Warrior or feral Druid tanking in Classic? Nope, not going to happen for a LONG TIME. With only Sunder Armor up (Expose armor and FF will have great diminishing returns, Fury Warrior threat will be much lower (their damage is 100% on pservers, with bosses having ZERO damage reduction from armor - in 1.12.1, raid bosses will still have about 50% physical reduction left after 5 Sunders). And since Fury Warrior and Feral Druid threat is basically damage dealt...say bye bye to quick fights in 1.12.1.
---
There will be only 31 points Prot Warriors as tanks (for Shield Slam)...as it was in Vanilla and it should be in Classic.
---
Additionally, ONE WIPE, and the entire raid will lose the world buffs...and wipes will happen to every guild during progress. Go back to Org and get the next Ony buff? Nope...because there won't be ANY Ony head left available. Next day maybe.
---
Cheap flasks ? Nope...not only that they will be expensive AF, but for months, NOBODY will even sell them outside their guild...because they will barely have any for their 2 tanks and couple healers per raid attempt.
---
"MC will be cleared in greens", "BWL will be a walk in the park", "Fury Warriors and Druids will tank raid bosses"...all this is true for private servers. In Classic...the above will be proven to be impossible.
---
The damage that players deal on pservers is HUGE...because the raid bosses have zero armor and probably very small spell resist. The damage that bosses deal on pservers is a joke compared to Vanilla 1.12.1. Every single guild on pservers can afford flasks, because of "dynamic" respawn crap. Etc. Etc.
---
Yes, raids will be a bit easier in Classic compared to Vanilla...but harder (MUCH harder) compared to pservers.
---
Great job lolzexd these are fun can't wait to see tomorrow!!

Those placeholder models were gone before 1.12..
---
Do you happen to know where I can watch the video? 
---
Multiboxers don't split up their toons for camping multiple spawns, they control all 5 at the same time at the same place. The only advantage he has is the increased DPS and safety of being in a group.
---
You can also be in a group, it just takes other people.
---
I second your third.
---
I'm not concerned about this at all.
---
Multiboxing is expensive and difficult. Most servers will have between 0 and 1 people doing it, and it's not as big of an advantage as people think.
---
it shouldnt, WotF specifically states: "Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec." 
---
Spell descriptions is btw, one of the things that we know is 100% correct, as it is stored in the DBC files, thus the info is mined from the client.
---
Source?
---
But hasn't multi-boxing has always been allowed?
---
I'd love to have a copy, but money is tight. Will you post when the final version is ready with a price? I'd love to get one eventually.
---
The recent world record naxx speedrun on private servers had night elf priests in the raid. Dwarf priest is incredible, but you only need a few of them even as a minmaxing guild, and any raid will want more than 1-2 priests so it really isn't hard to get into a raiding guild as any race priest tbh. 
---
&gt; Fury Warrior or feral Druid tanking in Classic? 
---
I just want to respond to this. I saw druids tanking bosses in Vanilla first-hand.
---
ok, well I saw one tanking Ragnaros. I've seen actual Vanilla videos of them tanking a handful of other bosses.
---
However, I've never see a fury warrior tanking a Vanilla boss.
---
I love this! Thanks for the post!
---
I would not even be mad if they change Chromies NPC to be in the know about classic wow
---
no
---
You don't need friends for leveling though.
---
Saying it’s “100% incorrect” only to finish stating that we don’t know if they have the old data to roll out patches authentic to BC or not contradicts each other. Check yoself fool.
---
I totally agree! I am all for having a more streamlined addon suite that fits our era without it being invasive to the core game mechanics. 
---
I've seen PS videos of moonkins (!) doing good damage but I think the main reason is that the bosses are dying so unrealistically fast so the moonkin never runs out of mana... (which would generally happen between 90-120 seconds).
---
Yeah, I generally enjoy the journey more than the destination. That's why playing on pservers with constant fresh releases or possibility of shutting down at any time has never been a concern to me.
---
he mentions it all at the beginning. But you are right... there is a lot controversial stuff in the video.
---
A full 1.0s faster LB and CL is crazy. No other caster gets that sort of cast time reduction through talents, 0.5s is the norm (and also chosen bc it's a major dps and mobility increase!)
---
Saying "I talked with this dude" is not a source.

I never understood the hype around endgame vanilla. The only thing particularly special about it is 40 man raids and some 10 man dungeons. People praise classic as the best but play it exactly like youd play new wow.... just to race to endgame and farm gear ilvls. Or queue the same 3 lame ass BGs to "pvp". Idk im gonna get tons of downvotes but later expacs did end game raiding better and there were better PvP games at WoW's release and many more have been released since. WoW just has the best world for true RPG players who want an MMO enviroment
---
actually it is most definitely a source. It's the definition of a source.
---
"What your source?  I talk to a Nostalrius dev"
---
Now you might not think it's a reliable source, but if a Nostalrius dev is not a reliable source for how PS code is implemented, then who is?
---
Yes...it is going to change back to how it was in Vanilla. The simple fact that armor reduction will be half compared to private servers will absolutely remove Fury Warriors and Feral Druids from tanking.
---
Why? Well, their threat is based on damage dealt, their damage is physical only...and bosses on private servers have zero armor reduction, because of Sunder Armor, Expose Armor and FF stacking.
---
In 1.12.1 (Classic build), the raid bosses will retain about 50% physical damage reduction...and that makes Fury Warrior and Feral Druid generate about HALF the threat they do on private servers.
---
This is the reason why Prot Warriors will be THE ONLY RAID TANKS. Their threat in Classic will be WAY, WAY above Fury Warriors and Feral Druids...and their survivability vastly SUPERIOR.
---
And this tank meta change will lead to LONGER fights, which will lead to more mana spent...add in the scarcity of flasks and world buffs, and you get the picture.
---
Which will lead to CASTERS being the majority of damage dealers in raids.
---
In a single word, the differences between pservers and 1.12.1 are SO BIG, that the entire pserver meta will go down the drain, from WHO is actually tanking (only Prot Warriors will tank raids in 1.12.1), to WHO is actually dealing more damage (will be casters in 1.12.1)
---
Back rights belt looks like a hanging penis. 
---
They could just keep one character in a spot and tab between their windows if they wanted.  It's just not a particularly efficient use of time.  If anything I would expect solo players to do most of the mining out in the world while the boxers stick to farming instances because they're not having to wait on others to get started, and don't have to split rare drops.  
---
The only thing anyone should really be worried about boxers is them running around in gank squads, and even then that's probably going to be limited to strictly ganking outside battlegrounds if follow remains broken inside them.

A reliable source for vanilla is one where you can date that the material is from that point. Then the point is either directly or indirectly (usually counted/figured out with math) shown in said material. 
---
No, armor reduction debuff was NOT additive in Vanilla. I guess you never played it. The ONLY armor reduction debuff in Vanilla applied to bosses was Sunder Armor. EA and FF had great diminishing returns, and no raid would take up 2 debuff slots for a minimal armor reduction.

Pointing out obvious toxicity doesn’t make one toxic. That’s a comically absurd argument. 
---
yes
---
Even for his own mana needs, it allows more efficient mana management and less stress. 
---
It's not a good raiding etiquette practice when people come to progression raids in suboptimal specs. It might not seem to be a big deal and most likely it won't matter if just one guy would come like that, but it all these little efficiency "cuts" add up.  And if you get a few people in the raids doing so it becomes quite impactful.
---
you cant cuz noone can ... this vid is full of bullshit that tips pulled out of his ass or the comment section of private servers
---
That, my friend, is Vietnam.
---
They were a very minor thing in Vanilla. I think there was maybe one multiboxer on my server and they weren’t that big of a deal in pvp. It’s a novelty. 
---
AQ isn't useful because you'll get your rep within a few weeks anyway and the materials needed for your t2.5 is gonna be heavily gated. Also you're gonna be running ZG for a long time after you get exalted.

---
Him saying "it'll probably be this way" based on how Classic is being created when the systematic reasoning for why it was done that way has no definitive bearing on BC is a 100% incorrect assumption. But leave it to a redditor to downvote and pick a semantically minute argument to refute instead of responding to the comment as a whole. They do not contradict, unless nuance is a foreign concept to you. 
---
It was also more difficult back in the day.  Back then, the first multi-boxer I recall was Xzin, who had 1 Priest and 4 mages, and he was operating on 5 computers with a wireless keyboard receiver taking prompts from 1 keyboard.  These days its much easier with all the software options people have come up with and computers being beefy enough to handle 20 instances.
---
Multiboxers always have been a thing in WoW, even in Vanilla when it was current and never was against the rules or a bannable offence. They never have been a great issue i nthe greater scheme of things. Multiboxing wasn't against the ToS back then, and shouldn't be now. 
---
Sure, lets just ignore the part where your actions are hurting other people.
---
You could argue that since they were defending against those shitty clone games, keeping players around with cheap gimmicks could've been the lesser of two evils. Especially if the long term plan was always to re-release previous versions of the game, which would only be possible with deep pockets.
---
Is this how warriors PvP? Charge, hamstring, run awway. Rinse and repeat
---
Well, as someone who has set up a private server in the past, I have personally seen some things in the code that the video talks about... namely the loot table problems and all of the mobs missing abilities. I have seen this in the actual code.
---
So I suspect that most of the other points are true as well.
---

I so want a Chromie server, I don't care how many streamers pick it I'll roll there without a second thought.

i know what you mean by no upfront cost but the subscription has some people i know annoyed. probably just annoyed with blizzard's "you think you have phones, but you don't"
---
As I mentioned someone else, I personally saw a bear tank Rag in Vanilla, and I have seen authentic Vanilla videos of bears tanking other bosses.
---
I think there are some fights that bears will be able to tank.
---
Played gnome mage and loved it always but I'm not hyped about re-mounting the mechanostrider and have been really tempted by switching to horde. So I'm stuck between troll, undead and gnome and will be doing even pvp/pve. Is it worth it to do the game from both factions?
---
Depends in what. For farming he might have, but for example in PVP a 5 account multiboxer should never win against 5 unique players in a decent group comp(unless he stomps them in gear or game experience) 
---
She often uses whelp form and a Gnome so she may prefer those "small" forms instead of showing age... or as a bronze dragon she may be somewhat outside of time with different meaning of age.
---
It has always been a thing yes, and afaik it has never been against the ToS. 
---
TBC was where multiboxing really started to be a pain in a competitive sense, because the popular build at the time was 1 Holy Paladin and 4 Elemental Shamans spamming chain lightning.  Blizz has gone out of their way to deal with that stuff now though by breaking follow in PvP.
---
Great advice. Thank you very much. 
---
WotF and Dev. Plague are over-rated IMO. Shadow guard is way cheaper and better for blackout procs on anyone attacking you. Sure you can WotF on boss fights here and there only when applicable, but Berserking...useful on any/every fight. Berserking is also useful in pvp but UNDOUBTEDLY, WotF will always be clutch when you need it, and thats the only perk it has.
---
Tipp's best video so far, I know a fair bit about private servers but only started playing a few months before BC so I know like none of this.  Really exciting stuff that the meta might not be so set in stone, I might try my hand at some lv 60 theorycrafting if there is a demand and I feel like I might discover something "new"
---
lol was thinking the same. If in outdoor pvp, that combo would be so bloody annoying.
---
The best combo in my mind would be:
---
1. Balance/feral hybrid 
---
2. HoTW/resto hybrid
---
3. Resto/Bear hybrid
---
Absolutely sick.
---
Why would a multiboxer be "anti-consumer", the person multiboxing is a consumer. It would be anti-consumer to prevent a customer to play the way he likes to play. 
---
Close enough

Don't forget frostbolt/firebolt rotation!

What is a character sheet?

Love when people talk about their plans for naxx when in reality probably 0.2% of the server will ever see the inside of naxx.

I know I'm a week late, but on the off chance someone sees this, I'm thinking of rolling priest but not sure that I want to do tailoring/enchanting for the zillionth time. 
---
Any thoughts on what else I could do? I've also done a lot of herb/alch, and that'd be more fun for me than tailoring/enchanting, but even then I'm not sold yet. 
---
Translation: *"I main a rogue and can't farm Dire Maul, so nobody else should be able to either. Plus, I can't gank people when they're farming an instance"*
---
The one on the right is just as beautiful as the one on the left.
---
I would love to have options for what I want to play.  I love Affliction warlock, but even a meme raiding guild wouldn't play it unless they change the debuff limit.
---
This is how I felt with the Tauren in the opening cinematic for WoW when he uses his Totem to bitch slap the dwarves pet bear 
---
YEARS later and still no Two Handed Totems for Tauren 
---
Eh?
---
You don't need to do all that to reset an instance when you're not inside it.
---
&gt; I might try my hand at some lv 60 theorycrafting 
---
I thought about doing this for a balance druid build and set up a spreadsheet with all of the damage, mana cost, spell coefficients for wrath, starfire and moonkin.
---
Then I worked the formulas for spirit regen and all of the other shit that would affect sustained dps in a raid fight. I did all of this with no access to PS or dps meters from target dummies. In partiular, it was almost impossible to find a way to not going oom within 90 seconds without downranking your casts (which screws your dps).
---
At some point I talked about it in a moonkin thread and some PS guy quickly jumped in and started contradicting all of my numbers. At first I figured I did a calculation wrong but never really figured out how he was doing almost 30% more dps on target dummies than what I could calculate. In addition, he didn't understand why I was worried about dps for 3-minute or 6-minute fights because apparently all bosses on PS are dead within 90 seconds so he never went OOM.
---
That's when I really started suspecting that PS numbers are way off and that all of "viable" meme builds are going to really struggle once Classic hits.
---
I’ll buy one when it’s done! 
---
Fabulous pants.
---
Now do the horde version
---
I've always used "gank" loosely as being attacked without warning, generally implying multiple enemies but not specifically so - between myself and my friends for nearly 2 decades.
---
All this time, I've never ran into an instance with another gamer where someone didn't understand what I meant.
---
It never worked correctly in vanilla either. It was easily the most bugged spell in the game. If there's a little rock in the path of your teleport, you'd just pop up in the air and go nowhere. You also couldn't blink on bridges or doorways at certain points.
---
It was incredibly irritating.
---
Because even while playing fulltime during summer leveling on a pvp server to 60 takes up to a month a half for above average players
---
It's changed over time, originally it meant a group kill to "**gan**g **k**ill" someone. Now it means to kill someone in a less than honourable way, either by killing a lowbie or someone fighting a mob.
---
Was sleepy. I worded out of expansion. 
---
"what took you so long to return adventurer?"
---
Spoken by people who never played real vanilla.
---
As someone who played from US launch, private servers I've played on have numerous fairly blatant inaccuracies, but they still feel far more like vanilla than the demo did. Though that demo shouldn't remotely represent the final product.
---
Pretty sure anyone who played classic have ptsd from this zone.
---
I’m not planning on rushing to 60 either...
---
 I’ll get to 60 alright, on more than one toon. Classic doesn’t end summer 2019. 
---
Lets gank this post
---
I thought that's how Black Lotus worked in vanilla. It just replaced the node of any other herb in the zone. You couldn't just camp a spot and wait for it to spawn.
---
"Headspace" by Velvet Revolver
---
It was in one of the episodes of World of Roguecraft (I think 2?)
---
I think the original one was removed a few years ago, but if you Google 3 man Onyxia there's a similar one with the same songs. 
---
I find stuff like that so much fun.  I usually am the "planner" of my guild, trying to research how to down a boss and pass that information on the all the people too lazy to watch a video (lol not that I mind).
---
Haha, nice one.
---
This is the cutest rendition of STV I've ever seen. Which makes it incredibly inaccurate. Where's the zone wide battlefield?? Or a rogue waiting to jump you literally every five feet?
---
I ran a raiding guild in TBC and we liked going into a boss fight "cold" on the first night. Just wiping and trying to figure out wtf happened. Then watch kill videos in prep for the 2nd night of attempts.
---
SSC was hilarious because we'd kill a boss and the immediately wipe on the trash leading to the next boss because, for example, we might not know that a mob as an AOE knockback that drops half the raid into the water.
---
The left is how my mind sees it when I close my eyes.
---
You don't combine Cheetah with another aspect. You combine with the group buff so when you click on someone grouped, you automatically cast the group buff, otherwise you cast the solo buff.
---
You combine Monkey and Hawk together as a toggle (becomes 1 button instead of 2) with a range target modifier so you only cast Hawk outside of melee range while targeting an enemy. Otherwise Monkey is default. You can also throw in Hunter's Mark if you want, or somewhere else.
---
When I say to make macro's to customize your hunter per build ... I mean to do it logically. If it doesn't make sense to you, DON'T DO IT!
---
If you’re planning to do a full map in this style I absolutely want to buy one, there’s a spot in my game room that needs exactly this :)
---
I got into WoW after watching that South Park episode too. The first hour or two, I just rolled a character on all 8 races just to see the starting zones. My first real character was an orc warrior with a randomly generated name. I leveled with my friend who played a tauren hunter. I remember running across durotar and barrens to meet him at camp taurajo. Good times. 
---
If you play 10 hours a week and spend an appropriate amount of time with your kid(s), and  considering how out of touch people on this sub are with the difficulty of classic wow, it'll take you a couple of months to get to 60 at best.
---
Will dungeons be worth doing if there's not a rebalance of end-game content?  That's what I'm worried about.  I love tanking max level dungeons.
---
I’m honestly fine with that. I would even like it to last a bit longer. The leveling process is fun in vanilla, in my opinion. 
---
My brother's going to be a shaman and I'm going to be a warrior.  While leveling, I'm going to be Arms.  What shaman spec would be best for us?  My first instinct is to worry about mana for healing.  Restoration seems improbable.  Elemental would have more mana and a bit more healing from spell power, but it would use more mana.  Enhancement would be less efficient but also use less mana.
---
What do you think?
---
I remember being in awe at the end of that quest chain when she punts you from Azshara to Western Plaguelands.  Such a simple mechanic and nothing compared to the tricks they pull today.  But back then I was stunned.
---
Ohhhhhh. Sssnnnaaap
---
Which race for Horde?  I've never been impressed by the Tauren ability.  If I can use an axe, Orcs would be better at holding threat, which IIRC was pretty important.
---
I'm telling you lol: the leveling process in fun while you're commenting about it on reddit, but when you're running back to your corpse for the seventh time in STV because you didn't level fast enough you'll change your mind ASAP. Unless you went on a pve server ofc
---
Which one is supposed to be different?  They look identical to me.
---
Yeah, fury and druid threat is diff. Where fury is getting their threat from their raw damage, maul has an insane threat multiplier coefficient so scales really really well with gear.
---
it do be like that
---
My first thought exactly!
---
You really don't see how an individuals ability to inject 100gold/hour into the server is gonna cause massive inflation across the board?
---
Druids are well suited as raid tanks for those few fights where being defense capped is not that important (i.e. resist fights). In those situations, a warrior tank's biggest advantage over a bear is removed, but bears still have their advantages (health, threat)
---
So the reality is... everything you hoped for and more? ;P
---
Chromie, you little bronze dragon shite...
---
...I've seen things you Dragons wouldn't believe.
---
Attack ships on fire off the shores of the Broken Isles.
---
I've seen Blood Elves glitter in the night by the Dark Portal.
---
All those moments will thankfully be lost in time, likes tears in the rain.  Time for Classic.
---
Have yo done any further testing and tested it in like bigger citys f.e.?
---
There one too in the SI7/vancleef quest line where he says something like “what are you going to tell me next, that deathwing is back?” 
---
I’m a patient guy. I don’t need rage over stuff like that. I’m not a hardcore raider or pvper either. Leveling was my think back then so I’m fully aware of how it can be. STV in vanilla is nowhere near how it is in private servers. 
---
True art right here.
---
I plan to win at lest one in classic.
---

"Should I follow my dreams in a situation where not following them is not bad?"
---
YES.
---
Dont be a nerd
---
Well we are just going to have to agree to disagree. The sheer amount of 'classic is going to be a ghost town/waste of time/just nostalgia' comments that I've seen on BOTH subs, are extremely prominent.
---
If you choose to ignore these and only see the other side, and trust me, I know there are toxic comments coming from classic fans too, then you are being unquestionably biased..
---
But that is just where we are never going to agree. 
---
Can't wait until I have shadowmeld back... My priest loved it so much.
---
Ganking In WoW has pretty much always been either killing someone way lower than you or killing someone when they’re low while grinding.

What do you mean all members of the raid need proper fire gear set to fight Rag?
---
This isn't like the private servers at all!

It's unlikely you'd find one in a reasonable amount of time, but the [Gizmotron Megachopper](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9490) (BoE from Gnomer) was a great alternative to Verigan's Fist.  I have no idea if it's available at launch or not, though.
---
Also, sorry if I overlooked it, but I didn't see any mention of debuffs or Purify in your post.  If you're using Exorcism, then that means you'll be grinding skellies and ghouls exclusively.  The ghouls generally cast a few debuffs (i.e. [Plague Mind](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=3429), [Contagion of Rot](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=7102), etc..), and you'll have to decide whether to ignore them or cast Purify which will eat into your mana and reset 5SR.  Just a heads up.
---
RemindMe! 1 Month
---
I started in late Vanilla (~November of 2006 or so) and didn't hit the level cap until TBC.  Some long-time raiding friends of mine got me into their guild on a trial basis, and *boy* was I bad.  I mean really bad.  Some highlights...
---
* I thought the point of Hemorrhage was to apply the debuff before going back to Sinister Strike  
---
* I specced Subtlety for DPS because "big ambush crits"  
---
* I didn't think gems or enchants were really worth the money
---
... you get the idea.  Anyway, thank god for the Rogue class leader who took me under his wing and taught me how to play.  My noobiest moment would have been my very first raid, ever.  We were in Karazhan and the run was going super well, despite my less-than-adequate DPS -- but hey, at least I never died on any encounters!  Eventually, we got to Prince Malchezaar, and I was beyond giddy at the prospect of getting a [Malchazeen](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=28768) for bigger Shadowstep-Ambush crits.  But then for some reason or another, I ended up dying on the fight.  I was mortified that the guild would call me a noob and /gkick me for dying so stupidly.  So I released my spirit and ran back into the instance portal, thinking that if I was fast enough I could get back in and jump back in the fight.  That was the day I learned you can't zone into an instance when an encounter was in process.  And of course the Malch dropped, but I was ineligible to loot it because I was stuck outside the instance, alive.
---
I eventually learned how to play and ended up being one of the better DPSers on my server, but I'll be damned if I ever saw that particular dagger drop again.
---
It would be funny if they used her new model in Classic
---
For emphasis for those who didn't play videya 15 years ago.
---
&gt; it meant a group kill to "gang kill" someone
---
When I firdt started playing I picked a human priest. I stayed in Northshire until almost lvl 10 because I didn't know where the exit was. Some guy on a horse showed me the way and it blew my teenage mind lol. Thought all of WoW was Northshire and didn't really get the hype 
---
Yea we'll see when classic is out how STV is
---
No, it has Vanilla xp and thats what our hunters did, from like 55-60, they killed elementals in Silithus for Waterlords rep
---
People usually don't tell snidely and condescendingly tell people who ask questions about their interest in clubs to basically fuck off and go do something else more their speed. People usually are not hyperdefensive about their hobbies and usually aren't aggressively gatekeeping them. Meanwhile on the official forums somebody asks "why can't we have transmog" and instead of explaining why transmog is problematic in vanilla wow people just insult and try to aggressively push that person away.
---
That isn't community building. So yes, people go on and on about how great the classic community is, while simultaneously actively pushing people away and deliberately discouraging interest in classic.
---
I'd go with Herb/Mining/Skinning as a means of making gold, OR tailoring if you'd rather have two primary profs, since tailoring doesn't need a gathering sidekick to support it.
---
The reduced cast speed of lightning spells and crit multiplier are why ele shamans even work in the first place.
---
You need at least both, and range is a huge boon.  Ele Mastery or NS are fine tradeoffs, but as your spell crit increases from better gear NS starts to become better.
---

OF COURSE you should follow your dream!  If you follow it, what's the worst that can happen?  You should only not follow a dream if it can hurt you.

Actual Translation: *"I think having one method of gold generation that vastly outclasses any other, especially when that one method is instanced and does not require you to interact with anybody in an MMORPG, is unhealthy for a game and should possibly be slightly nerfed to bring it in line with other farming techniques"*
---
Um what? SM was an epic failure of loot distribution. Lib was pure caster loot, Armory was pure melee loot. The only way to ever put a group together was to promise to run both, but then without fail somebody would leave after you did their wing.
---
IDK how embarrassing it is rather than naive but when I was first starting the game I remember making my first gold. I was excited and wanted to give it to another character so I ran over to stormwind to find someone to give my gold to. The first person I find is this dwarf standing outside the gates. I ask him if I could give him my 1 gold and if he could wait outside the gates so I could log on another character to come get it back, to which he agreed. So i switch and run back and search for the dwarf who was no where to be found.
---
Tailoring is the popular choice since you don't need to pair it with a gathering profession. Best for cloth dps.  Engineering is a possibility if you're going to PvP. Or a gathering as second to either sell the mats or send to a crafting alt for cash. Just depends on your goal. 
---
Yes. Dungeons are how people gear. Just because *some* people can clear MC with bad gear doesn't mean many can or those who can would even want to (they would do it on server launch asap just for the extra lockout(s), but they wouldn't keep doing it in bad gear). The best dungeon gear is usually as good (if not better) as most T1, just with less/no stamina. 
---
Even when most dungeon gear becomes irrelevant (~AQ) there are still reasons to run Strat-UD (Stratholme Holy Water), Strat-Living (Righteous Orbs), DM-Tribute (World Buffs). Also with Classic I imagine there will be many more casual players keeping dungeons alive for much longer than they typically are on pservers. 
---
Engineering doesn't need mining, just use the profit from Enchanting and other goldfarm methods to pay for your grenades/sappers/trinkets.
---
1. The ability to engage King Gordok without engaging Cho'Rush is an obvious and inexcusable bug on private servers. There is allot of ambiguity, but the patch notes are abundantly clear that it should not be possible.
---
2. The change to the key does not affect hunters soloing the instance. One would be required to kill the first boss in order to acquire it anyway. The lost time exceeds the potential gold gain from simply crafting explosives to blow the door open, even if you have to buy the materials.
---
Different hunters have different methods for doing the run, all involve somehow juking the caster in such a way that he will at no point be able to finish off a cast. My preferred method is using the middle section of the large platform, where you can walk up, to manipulate the distance between the two mobs. If the two mobs become too separated, you run the risk that they take two different routes to chase you.
---
NE PvP master race
---
I feel reassured.  Thank you.
---
I don't understand the need to aggressively push people away because they enjoy a game most of the classic community happens to not enjoy. I don't understand the need to react with hostility when somebody asks "but what about paladin taunts"instead of explaining why that is problematic and the consequences it could have including further upsetting class balance, or simply stating that the game is being designed as close to vanilla as possible, and this suggestion falls outside of that scope.
---
I personally would prefer to see more people tell others to try the game first, play a few classes, and if they still find it unplayable, it probably isn't merely the lack of \*insert change here\* that makes it "unplayable" but rather the game's design philosophy as a whole.
---
I don't understand why people feel the need to be bitter, hostile, and aggressive about it. I understand telling people "sounds like this might not be the game for you." I don't understand "go back to retail and quit trying to ruin classic".
---
Actually, I'm going to play with my brother.  He's making a resto shaman and I'm making a prot warrior, so we'll work together nicely.  However, he doesn't have a lot of time to play, so I won't be playing my warrior when he's busy - which naturally leads to me having several alts.
---
Real paladins [never personally touch their keyboard](https://youtu.be/R_rF4kcqLkI?t=175). You just need to optimize your physical addons to work with your virtual addons.
---
Actually wouldn’t mind the TCG/etc items being in the store, considering they’re otherwise basically impossible to get. Blizzard gets money + we don’t arbitrarily lose content. Mounts are slightly tricky because buying a mount is an obstacle in game.
---
I think 30 is when you really start seeing what your class is all about and get into some real pvp situations.
---
You can't have 10 DPS warriors in one raid.  You have to take some rogues.
---
Yeah every time somebody ranks NElf as worst race for warrior or priest I just think back to how often I wasn't ganked simply because of shadowmeld. 
---
I forgot Chromie was in vanilla. What a cool character she’s been over the years. 
---
It's a sentiment I've seen too, though. I tried out a private server because I remember playing several hunters in vanilla and got my ass handed to me until I got my sea legs back so to speak. After that initial difficulty curve, which is really just jarringly different mechanics, the game isn't "hard" so much as just "different".
---
Man this guy is oppositional.  It took me like a year to hit 60 on my first character, but what the fuck ever.  It was fun.
---
Is it set for July?
---
I love beating up gnomes.  They squeak like chew toys.
---
Technically, the burdon of proof lies on Tips Out side - but after trying to reach out to him on his discord server, I failed to get any. It is ofcourse possible he hasnt seen this himself!
---
First and foremost I think it is a very just video - and for a superbly just cause. Everything on the private servers indeed aren't correct. And normally I wouldn't spend any time to comment on this, but TipsOut is starting to gain a rather large crowd. It is therefore significant that such an amount of people arent told things that are untrue. Im fully aware that he is most likely just talking about 'themes', but here and there he slips in hard truths which are easily verified and falsified.
---
However, in this video he states wild and strong accusations of both past and present with no source at all. (Saying I talked to X guy who was "a part" of nostalrius doesnt hold water at all) As a whole, I wont go into detail of every single thing he says because that ultimately defeats the case. My main intention is simply to see sources and verifications for the things he is claiming, at such a massive audience, which goes beyond me as a listener. Therefore ill quickly just jump over some topics, in my own ignorance and idioty to question the claims.
---
Worldbuffs. It is pretty much known that there is supposed to be a cooldown. "In vanilla only one ony head or nef head buff could be active at a time" This is outright not true. You can have both of the pillars active at the same time. The event is unique for each (notice the color of the head) Now, the buff is triggered from the event, and logically it should be tied to that - http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.7.0 this supports this idea.
---
So the question is, how long does the event last? Personally Ive never seen a 2h source. (He claims so at 2:55)
---
Here is a 6h and 1h for warchiefs: https://alt.games.warcraft.narkive.com/nbkesSJ1/turing-in-onyxia-head-turnin-city-buffs
---
On note for the DM(T/E/W) talk. Tips claims nothing was ever done on retail. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.3 "Dire Maul King Gordok can no longer be separated from Cho'Rush the Observer in Dire Maul." Seems to suggest otherwise.
---
"We have no idea what boss armor were in vanilla". Most servers use the generic 4691 armor which is suggested by the bestiary. From all the sources Ive seen bosses vary between 3500-5700 in armor (Typically mobs are divided into 3 categories in armor values). So, as a minimum you will always find bosses between this. You can go to youtube and find videoes of say Naxx. Check their damage and calculate back and forth. https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11519 https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11520 https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11522
---
All these sources suggest [some] naxx bosses should have 3700 whilst private servers mostly have been using 4691. We have no idea? Sure, we cant go .npc info on some true "classic" server. But you can calculate what each boss' armor is by ~99% precision.
---
Regarding the whole armor /reduction/ discussion, Ive no idea how you would see it be multiplicative. The only mechanics in vanilla (AFAIK) which are multiplicative are the ones which are % based. Say, attack speed. Anything else related to NPCs and (de)buffs is additively, if its a flat amount.
---
7.55 The "A more powerful spell" argument doesn't really work. Its a guideline for buff/debuffs in vanilla but there are a lot of exceptions. If this was already true, you wouldnt be able to apply more than the strongest deep wounds to a boss. https://youtu.be/fUYyX5EdY1k?t=303 Here you can see both FF and Sunder being active. https://youtu.be/OuPLWf24OME?t=623 Here you can see both FF, CoR and Sunder being active https://youtu.be/XOpxCUuXDH8 In this video you can see TF overwriting TC.
---
Now you can argue that buffs can be applied without having effect. That is indeed correct, however, that would completely surrender the mechanic of the "more powerful spell being active". Ill gladly remove this point, but then we need a new premise.
---
Youre saying we dont know what the resistance values are at all either. The same applies here (although it is more complicated to calculate). And then you say it is likely they deal more than they would on classic. If your premise (https://youtu.be/RYepdsfid4w?t=555) is correct, wouldnt it also be likely they could deal more on classic?
---
Anything where you touch stuff that outside of the world is a bit iffy to comment on. No vanilla server (2004-2006) had more than 4k pop. It is only natural for a 10k server pop to change it, indeed you could even argue increasing the nodes/spawns to correlate with the population is the "blizzlike" change. Anything regarding loot I dont really grasp. The loot tiers are divided into pools which are rolled individually with their own chances. This has been the case since late Emerald Dream (Feenix). Which server saw double DEoI? ND (the server TipsOut plays on) definitely doesnt have this as it is based on the nost cores (unless new changes has been made)
---
Suggesting that the raids will be harder because the world buffs have a cooldown, kinda fails to imply when the modern private servers release new content with world buffs disabled. Fewer flasks is not necessarily the case if you compare population + people actually interested in using a flask.
---
MC will still be piss-easy with absolutely no world buffs or flasks at all, if the itemisation is just standard 1.12 and the raid is balanced as it was in retail vanilla. Maybe a Titans for the MT, but nobody else needs anything. 
---
During that time, spellpower basically didn't exist on items, whereas now you can literally get 400+ spellpower, 3% hit, and 9% crit in just pre-raid BiS and normal class buffs as a mage. That's not even mentioning stuff like 10% crit from Winter's Chill, and the fact that all other mages can go 31/0/20 and wreck.
---
The problem is "the wrong sort of people" may have otherwise been interested in classic, may have played classic, may have contributed to classic's long term success. But we'll never know when people aggressively push people away for having the audacity to enjoy retail wow.
---
Does BRD stay relevant?  I love that instance.
---
To be clear, he's referring to something Tips himself said. It was in one of the duels in his duel tournament. 
---
I'm also interested in this kind of build. Might test it out this summer.
---
I think it's not worth speccing in lightning talents without lightning mastery. I'd rather have more shock/utility talents if 21 is the most points youre gonna spend in elemental.
---
Also maybe consider a build like Sham's build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hg0uLf0oZxbbZVcbx0xo
---
You lose purification and some resto utility, but gain 5% mana, imp ghost wolf+guardian totems. I think it's like a PvP support/utility healer. 
---
Unfortunately for shamans, if you want a lightning bolt /chain lightning based spec, you need 30 in ele en 20 in resto I think (:
---
The premise of his argument is that we dont know what the "true" values are. This doesnt directly correlate to them being harder, they might aswell be easier. 
---
Honestly this worries me. Dwarf priest is on my list of possibles for classic. I just love dwarves. I love their zones, the lore, the /jokes, I like to sit at my computer with a giant stein drinking while playing as a dwarf. It's a bummer that for better or worse many will see you as a min/maxer looking for an easy guild invite.
---
I multibox 40 on retail and I constantly get people talking shit about how I’m wasting so much money and how I must be rich but I just pay my sub with gold and have only ever paid money for one of the accounts.
---
It takes about 10 hours a month of farming to pay for all the subs but I’ve been doing about 60 in preparation for classic.
---
Blizz still gets even more money out of me paying gold than they would if I used money so I doubt they’re too upset about it.
---
Yeah... That's what he said...
---
Durr durr durr wasting time with sub optimal RP builds is fun durr durr durr. I like to ERP in goldshire because no human being would ever touch me IRL so I roll nightelf. 
---
Play the way you want. do you blame me for not wanting to waste my time wiping with RPers who only wear gear that looks good on their fantasy woman? Maybe if  they werent so smelly and unkempt they could pay to have a real woman satisfy their goldshire urges. Enjoy your dungeon blues. I play the game to experience the content with other competent people, not ERP in the goldshire inn because I can't get a girlfriend. 
---
Chromie best dragon. Don't @ me
---
You won’t need to worry about multiboxers in battlegrounds at all. Since classic is based off 7.3.5 there’s a 99.9% chance that follow will not work in them. In world pvp follow might still work though since they only broke that it 8.0

There are some pros and cons to modern addons.
---
On the one hand, some addons back in vanilla were OP and nerfed for a reason--like quickheal-type addons that automatically selected target, spell, and spell rank with the click of a button. This was literally a one-button brainless almost completely automated heal addon.
---
On the other hand, some API functions were not accessible in vanilla, making modern attempts to recreate them for 1.12.1 full of clunky, bloated workarounds. Some functionality isn't attainable at all with the old API.
---
We also don't know for sure (I don't think at least) if they'll restrict some portions of the API to break some addons for classic. They've been known to break addons before, but whether they'll break addons that "go against the spirit of classic" is still to be seen.
---
We probably won't have old decursive, if that's what you mean. But we also may not have the full funcionality of, say, RealUI either.
---
I don't necessarily disagree. DM farming is way too effective compared to other methods, especially hunters and trib runs. But there are simply too many gold sinks in the game to make everyone have to fight over world nodes and mobs.
---
This is not about the /roll but about the 'Greed' and 'Need' rolls. If more than one player get the highest roll, it's random which one wins the item.
---
Mass multiboxers in world pvp will probably have a very hard time ganking any significant number of people on account of aoe not having any diminishing returns back then. It would only take like 4 people with sappers to instantly wipe a raid of 40 that are stacked up. I also suspect that after a multiboxer is killed by a small group they’re going to find themselves camped for a long time.
---
"dumb flower offhand" - this made me chuckle.
---
BUT REMEMBER - this is classic so you have to stop along the way and smell the roses.  How much easier will that be with a dumb flower offhand? Infinitely better.
---
&gt; that does not necessarily mean they are easier on private servers 
---
Private servers are pure evil incarnate. When a value is literally unknown, like armor and resists - everyone *knows* private server devs have gone with whatever is easiest! Come Classic, those private server heroes will be left in the dust as we law abiding citizens rush forward unchained by their fisherprice meta. 
---
This subreddit, btw. 
---
What is important is that the content is fun and engaging. It has to FEEL like classic, putting the exact same values is a good start but it would be better if they buff raids especially they earlier ones. It's important the bosses don't immediately die, you want to actually see the raid mechanics like ragnaros phase2. Obviously don't want to make the fights last forever, but I hope you understand my point.
---
&gt; They were a very minor thing in Vanilla.
---
couldnt it only be because of bad pc's back in the day?
---
Retail and classic appeal to different demographics. I don't expect much overlap between those two demographics.
---
I agree that it's more than just nostalgia. Private servers have been very successful for a very long time and it isn't just because "nostalgia". I tried out a private server, got a hunter and shaman to \~30 before the official announcement dropped. I'm impatiently waiting for an official server now because I legitimately enjoy vanilla gameplay just like I did in 2005.
---
If blizzard doesn’t change the number of black lotus spawns on account of us knowing where they all are and how few there are, in theory a multiboxer could camp all of them simultaneously.. even on a pvp server they could just use rogues or night elves to sit there stealthed.
---
Evil is a bit strong, but they're definitely catering to their player base in order to monetize in some shady ways. More power to them, because of their work we can play a version of vanilla before classic comes, and I'm pretty sure that private server players will not have a problem adjusting to a different set of rules.
---
runs around spamming priest fear
---
I was another EQ refuge.  I came to WoW kicking and screaming after realizing people were simply not coming back to Everquest.
---
Had a blast in Vanilla.  Had a blast in BC but I saw the writing on the wall.   Wotlk confirmed my fears but I still stuck it out.  Cata hit and was a blast until they nerfed the shit out of everything then I really faded from playing.   I tried again in Legion but holy hell nope.
---
I've been screwing around on Pservers for quite a while just leveling random classes and such. No serious raiding or PvP, waiting for Classic.
---
I remember the guild in was in back in vanilla and beyond. We had some kids in it "not many", But when it came to raiding no kids allowed. Everyone on vent and speaking. 18 min age allowed. Everything else it was fine for kids. Once we got to no a person which we where faily confident was NOT a kid. He or she was allowed to mute there mic if they wanted for a raid. But usually more often than not everyone didnt do this due to everyone having to communicate at one point during the raid. 
---
I agree. 
---
Literally everywhere. There are a billion relevant reps for all different kinds of playstyles. Rep gave you gear, discounted purchases from NPCs, crafting patterns, mounts, consumables, attunements, the list goes on. 
---
&gt; That's when I really started suspecting that PS numbers are way off and that the supposedly "viable" meme builds are going to really struggle once Classic hits. 
---
You are being highly optimistic. Except the odd 1 or 2 players per top guild per realm, that with immense effort and help from the guild will somehow pull off a Druid tank or a SP or Ret Pally...every other "meme" builds that are somewhat viable on pservers (raid wise) will get nuked by the 1.12.1 reality.
---
Few people on this sub actually played Vanilla extensively, and even fewer played both Vanilla on Blizz servers and pservers. Hence, A LOT of people are unable to understand that private servers are WAY WAY OFF, not just a little off. The current meta on private servers will simply not exist in Classic.
---
The meta in Classic will be the meta that was in Vanilla. 
---
In the end, this is what we asked for : A Vanilla experience. And this is what Classic will be.
---
No, but most of the community is speculating it to be a July release. I'm personally hoping for June!
---
I really wish people would just let other people enjoy things. 
---
Yeah the artist is seriously talented.
---
Escort the chicken in tanaris
---
I tried it on my normally-shadow priest briefly.  It was a bunch more damage but the mana efficiency was complete garbage.  Might work in PVP or with better gear.
---
Blizzard wasn't shy about nerfing gold farming methods back in vanilla. The very first I can remember was Undamaged Hippogryph Feathers, which dropped from Hippogryphs in Azshara. These were a standard drop and were required for a quest, but players quickly learned that they were incredibly lucrative. Back at launch, these items sold for around 2 gold 50 silver to vendors, leading to Azshara being over-run with gold-farming bots endlessly killing Hippogryphs. Blizzard stepped in and drastically nerfed the sale value of the item. 
---
I can also remember back in beta, when Mages had invisibility, that they added in Detect Invisibility to mobs in dungeons to prevent Mages just running through the whole instance and killing the end boss for loot, and eventually this contributed to the spell just being removed. Dire Maul had mobs like the Eyes of Killrog added in specifically to stop stealth teams reaching end bosses easily. 
---
So overall I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard did nerf gold farming methods. I really hope they do, since without intervention I can't see any other way to avoid nightmarish inflation. 
---
I listened to Everglow by Mae and Under the Cork Tree by Fall Out Boy quite a lot while leveling back in the day. Every time any songs from either of those albums comes on, I usually get some great nostalgic feels about MC and UBRS. 
---
The guild was currently progressing through BWL when this was occurring, so the druid definitely had no AQ40/Naxx gear.
---
Yep. Grouping will people and chatting for a while afterwards, exploring, dicking around, I mean geez it took forever to get to max level because I kept getting distracted, but it was so worth it. The world felt so much bigger and mysterious. 
---
&gt; Because both are based on 1.12  
---
Wrong. Classic is based on 1.12.1.
---
Private servers are based on TBC patch builds, with "guessed" values from some videos.
---
Classic will be far more closer to Vanilla than pservers have ever been.
---
I am 99% certain DW Fury Warriors and Feral Druids will be a thing in Classic WoW. DW Fury will we slightly nerfed because you can't /sit to have 100% uptime of Enrage,  but I don't think that is a huge deal.
---
Sunder Armor and Faerie Fire did stack 
---
Here is a post from 2005 about it  [http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/printthread.php?tid=6371](http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/printthread.php?tid=6371). 
---
The reason Dual Wield Fury works is because as long as you have more than 7,000 health all of the time, being crushed isn't that big of a deal. So as long as you have a high health pool and your healers proactively healing you, you can risk lower defense in exchange for more threat generation.  
---
Not sure what you are talking about with 100% vs 50% damage, but over the years private server bosses have actually been buffed to have more armor and damage over how they were believed  to be in Vanilla because people complained about them being too easy. But if it were true and that tanks generated less threat because physical damage is reduced, it would be even more important to spec Fury and be pushing threat as high as possible.
---
Pre 1.11, Shield Slam had a much lower threat modifier and was considered useless. So do you think people just didn't beat the content before patch 1.11? No main tanks were speced Fury (not Dual Wielding probably or non Def capped like they are now however) because Blood Thirst was Warriors best threat ability. 
---
Flasks were cheaper back in Vanilla than they are now because there was less demand for them. That might change in Classic, but that would be something new compared to what it was like back then. And if Flasks are unaffordable for the vast majority of people playing the game, people will resort to buying gold like they have throughout the history of the game when buffs for raiding have become too costly. 
---
If you’ve seen them then link them. 
---
You keep claiming this stuff is rampant yet haven’t provided any substantive proof. 
---
There is a long, cool quest that mimics the Zelda games. Takes you all over Kalimdor, part requires you to be dead and run around as ghost
---
Cool. Could you PM me? Better to keep track that way.
---
Wow that sounds crazy. Where do you get it?
---
Sadly the zones won't have the same density in detail as this one, but yes, I'm making a full-scale map atm.

Already in production. PM me if you want a print shipped.

Lets gank bang it. Line up gentlemen.
---
&gt; that with immense effort and help from the guild will somehow pull off a Druid tank or a SP or Ret Pally.
---
Bear tanks were a thing. Maybe not most fights, but definitely some. As a 60 noob I joined a raiding guild that was progressing through BWL. We had a bear tank Ragnaros the first time I saw him killed.
---
This was not a "top guild" carrying a bear tank. That might be more true for pally tanks, but I cannot personally speak to that.
---
Gild this 
---
I'll make a post on r/classicwow soon. No worries.
---
It won't launch until like the end of the year. Change my mind.
---
Completely agree with your comment. The real showcase of Captain Marvel will be in Endgame.
---
Her lack of any struggle related to her power made her movie feel safe and without much suspense. There wasn't any sense of danger.
---
Thanos should be a good match for her. She should not be able to take him on by herself however...
---
And they die fast because :
---
1. Armor reduction debuffs additive on pservers&gt; Fury Warrior/Bear tanking &gt; bigger threat &gt; more DPS from rogues/warriors &gt; less mana spent on healing the tanks = bigger heals = the use of Fury Warriors/Bears
---
2. Flasks + world buffs
---
3. Boss damage dealt is much lower on pservers
---
In Classic, tanks will be Prot Warriors (17/3/31), which means less threat, which means less DPS. Armor reduction will be half as powerful in Classic compared to pservers &gt; less DPS from Warriors and Rogues (that make up over HALF the raid DPS on pservers) &gt; longer fights &gt; smaller heals. Add in the scarcity of flasks...
---
I always liked the one in the Thandol Span, when you had to go down into the actual bridge.  I remember after I finished, I spent a good 20 minutes trying to jump to the shattered one
---
Sometimes being able to avoid a fight on a PvP server is priceless. It could be saving you minutes from a brutal death run or get you that little bit of extra info/time to grab a buddy so you can gank someone. I never regretted having shadowmeld.
---
&gt;Always were, always will be
---
So, you can't use DOTs in raids, I guess, other than corruption.  I really like DOTs in other situations. :(
---
This is embarrassing because I used to be this dumb. When I first started playing I was really young and spent gold as fast as I got it on random junk I didn't need. So I was broke a lot and didn't feel like questing or grinding. Because I didn't actually want to work, I would go to Goldshire late at night when it was rife with debauchery, and I would sell "private shows" and like... roleplay and stuff even though I had no idea what I was doing. Only made a few gold from doing that because someone quickly called me out on my laziness, we had a big fight in general chat about it, and I didn't want my guild to find out so I stopped. It was one of the dumbest things I've ever done and I can't believe I'm posting about it on Reddit. At least I learned my lesson RIP. 
---
Can confirm the cringing. I tried german servers couple of times but never could get used to the names. It seems I can only enjoy WoW in its original language. 
---
I have been master of my Vanilla domain for 13 years.
---
Believe it was a questline which started in UnGora or Tanaris around lvl50. You need to help a green gnome called Linken with a lot of stuff :)
---
There’s no time limit on it last time I checked. 
---
The chili breath quest
---
And reality is much cooler tbh
---
No, molten core has dark iron nodes, also mages &amp; rogues have some ways to solo farm the dark iron from BRD.
---
at level 6 you start running into red linking mobs, and this will shit on a huge number of players unwilling to adjust to a slower paced game. The late teens is where the grind sets in for most players I think, because quest pathing takes a lot of deliberation that they probably wont have. On Alliance a lot of human players will quit in Westfall because they won't know to go to Loch Modan first. Horde will see quitters due to quest competition in Barrens. The 20s will kill off a lot of unintuitive players, who don't know how to adventure for powerspikes, and their ability to stay relevant will tank without on level BiS weapons. 30s is where wPvP starts in earnest and will kill off another set of players. 
---
If a player hits level 40, I think they'll probably stick it out, or they'll quit due to IRL. Either way, a huge number of players will get culled in the leveling process. 
---
Tailoring, so you can make your own greens to disenchant.
---
I'm late to the party so I don't think my question will get answered but... if Regrowth's healing over time effect doesn't scale on plus healing as suspected, does that make Regrowth's HoT the only healing or damage over time effect that costs mana that doesn't scale at all?  I couldn't think of a single other example so I wanted a second opinion.
---
Secondly, if the HoT doesn't scale.  Wouldn't that make it always less mana inefficient than Healing Touch in every  way?  Any rank with 2.0 cast or better, any level, any gear, PvP or PvE.  If it only healed the tooltip amount that would make it always a bad heal unless you wanted dispel protection right?
---
Just wondering, thanks.
---
It's my shinny metal ass
---
yeah shieldless tanking is meta if you have the gear to not die. Absolutely no reason to limit your dps and tps if you don't need to worry about mitigation. 
---
Thanks man! Looking forward to it.
---
On a similar vein, I remember playing EQ for the first time.  After killing some spiders I moved on to a gnoll.  He said some phrase about how he was going to destroy me, but he used my characters name!  It completely blew my mind and actually freaked me out a little.  How did the gnoll know my characters name, lol?  I hadn't seen anything even close to that before.  Such a small and easy thing to code, but so impactful to me.
---
I cannot accurately convey the terror I felt when I first explored that innocent bridge and all seemed well until I rounded a corner and got dog-piled by skull level dwarves. 
---
aight cool
---
Vanilla was fun, because it was an investment. And it was extremly social, i still talk to people i played with in vanilla 15 years ago. They just dont make games like that "hardcore" anymore, i mean even just casual leveling was hardcore back then.
---
Unfortunatly it changed over time, to the worse im my opinion.
---
I have never heard of this one, that sounds incredibly interesting!
---
I have my computer set up IN my bathroom..../victorylap
---
There's a difference between a grind that ends with a clear payoff (rep grind, gold for a mount etc) and an endless grind with no end goal (azerite).
---
It definitely is. I lose myself in there all the time. Such a fun experience.
---
you didn't actually answer my question
---
Nefls don't have Shadowmelt any more?
---
FF and Sunder Armor can be both active, because Sunder is physical, and FF is magic. HOWEVER, Expose Armor CANNOT be active with Sunder Armor...and that is the MAIN PROBLEM, because Expose Armor is -1750 armor, while FF is -450.
---
The damage reduction from armor in Vanilla have diminishing returns...and they apply also for LOSS of armor, except the other way around. As an example, a 10,000 armor value from gear gives 70% damage reduction. The next 1000 points of armor will NOT give 7% additional damage reduction, but much less, probably around an additional 2%.
---
On the other hand, a boss that have 3500 armor will have 40% damage reduction, but with every point of armor loss from debuffs, he will lose LESS damage reduction. The problem with private servers is that Sunder Armor + Expose Armor + FF (2250+1750+450 = 4450 ) go OVER the value of any boss armor, which makes pure physical damage dealers (rogues and warriors especially) doing FULL damage to bosses.
---
With Sunder Armor and FF up, the armor reduction is only 2700, which still leaves a boss of 3700 armor with 1000 armor, but those 1000 points of armor left provide bosses with MORE than half of their initial damage reduction (the first 1000 points of armor provide more damage reduction than the next 2000 points of armor).
---
In other words, a boss with 40% armor reduction, will STILL retain 20% damage reduction from armor in 1.12.1 (Classic), as opposite to 0% on private servers.
---
In again, other words, half of the raid DPS from warriors and rogues will be hampered by at least 20%, for spell caster bosses and more than 20% for physical bosses.
---
Tips is not wrong.
---
There will be a massive differences between pservers and Classic, especially raid-wise.
---
While that is not the same as saying nothing about them is correct, as was my statement. I can not see this? Could you help me in the right direction? =)
---
Yeah, its going to be unknown until launch. For hardcore raiders everything will be easily beatable either way. But for the 99% there's hope it is challenging and engaging. 
---
There's no sword skill racial (for thunderfury) so race matters less on Horde.
---
I would recommend Orc for the extra threat with axes, great for dps and pvp as well. There's no guarantee getting TF so Orc seems like the clear winner to me. 
---
Tips will probably read this
---
"The game starts at end game" is crap design brainwashed into players by TBCs idiotic developers.
---
Cuergo’s Gold
---
Which quest?
---
Ok, bye.
---
What does he have on private servers? Was this a point of contention?
---
&gt;  if Regrowth's healing over time effect doesn't scale on plus healing as suspected,
---
I was a druid healer in BC and I seem to remember that a portion of your +healing went to the base healer and the rest of it went to the hot
---
Ya, armor value has been guessed and is based off an image of maexxna the last boss in the spider wing of naxx.
---
If this is your one and only character, you'd be hard pressed to get the Enchanting materials with relative ease. As said in this thread (and the countless others over the years) is that Tailoring is a crafting profession that doesn't really need a gathering profession along side it. 
---
You can easily pair the two and make it to max, and then switch out Tailoring for something else, but then you'll still be hard pressed to get the gathering materials to level up the new profession. Let us say that you went Tailoring/Enchanting and then swapped the Tailoring for Engineering because of PvP. You will either need to buy all of the mining mats for Engineering of the AH/guildies/friends, or you would have to level another character just for Mining.
---
My advice to you is do whatever it is you want to do, WoW is a game and games should be fun to play; however, I will say that you need to be cognizant of the hardships that may come from choosing to do Enchanting with anything else on a single character. 
---
What is shadowmeld? 
---
itt: people who don't realize op is being satirical
---
Sounds like you should be playing retail.
---
Can be very efficient if you have a group. Wipe on that and it’s the biggest waste of time haha. I got tilted with that
---
Savory Deviate Delight is your friend
---
Gotcha. I’ll add you when I get home
---
That is possible but seems unlikely. When the game drops People gonna be on YouTube for advice or on wow for fun. Most of us are here because we have blue balls. Talking on this sub relieves some of the pressure. 
---
Who is saying expose and sunder stacks and is supposed to stack?  To my knowledge this is not the case on any modern private server. 
---
The gain from armor is indeed not linear, as you suggest. The first armor point matters the most, however I dont see how this correlates to what is mentioned above.  
---
The only reason expose is used is because it with talents and 5x CP gives 200-300 more reduction than 5x sunders does. They dont stack on any on the modern servers. Which of them do? 
---
FF + CoR + Annihilator + 5x CP Expose + Talent = 1700 (+50%), 505, 640, 600 = 4.295 armor. Patchwerk is supposed to have 3.700 according to that source.
---
The armor formula I got doesnt suggest that " a boss with 40% armor reduction, will STILL retain 20% damage reduction from armor in 1.12.1" is true, which formula are you working with? 
---
I dont doubt there will be massive differences, but this is not correlated to this specific point. 
---
There's a lot of things that will change from what we know right now in private servers when classic will be released since lots of values, spells, and how they work are guessed and tried to imitate as best as it possible can be. 
---
You’re limiting your gameplay a lot by not paying attention to stories/lore
---
Most of the quests I'd consider memorable were unfortunately not really "leveling" quests. 
---
The chain of the fallen hero of the horde in the Blasted Lands comes to mind. Likewise, there were Tirions quests in the eastern Plaguelands or the Darrowshire line in the same region. All contain a lot of fetching in between, but the end is what sticks out in my mind. 
---
In the leveling range, the escort quests come to mind. All of them, really, but they stick out because they were really annoying. The Myzrael chain in Arathi is also something remember. And that little harbor in the back of Stromgarde, for some reason. Do those count as "off the beaten path"? Not sure. 
---
The Chromie questline lead you to the cave in Winterspring (I said Azshara I know) with the blue dragons.  Have to save the welps or something, after killing the main baddie, you meet Chromie outside the cave and she needs to send you back to Andorhal quickly so she punts you into a loading screen.  Mind you it's been a million years and I dont think the questline exists past Cata so I could be remembering wrong.
---
There is frequently more than one target up. You can throw a couple dots on the off target which will help bring it down before it's the main target, not to mention bonus nightfall procs.
---
Euros are gross. GROSS!!!!  NA or Aus or die. Aussies are great however.

Tomorrow in the news:

“Blizzars Cancels classic. ‘We just didn’t have the models’ one employee said”

I've always had 2 characters minimum, I need my group guy who's always helpful and my lone wolf who is just out there too farm and look out for only himself.

Hunter 8 piece t3 is mor3 th3n a bit underwhelming 
---
I’m a male troll. I’m not a wanna-be Bob Marley,  but I’m all about being chill and renewable energy! 
---
The Tauren was spot on. The casual jock “Yea, I guess I’ll play this game!” 
---
So did private servers have him stronger or weaker than the 3000 armor version?
---
Ay
---
Stronger
---
Let's be serious for a moment. In my mind, these two images have always been the same. I didn't look at the artwork, and compared it to the visuals of the game. The artwork was a part of the fantasy, and the imaginary world my mind had created along side the game. 
---
Well remember. I got very excited seeing this post! Thank you!
---
I love doing quests in enemy territory. Horde can chat with the captain guy in Westfall. There’s an undead quest giver on the edge of duskwood and deadwind pass.
---
Not if you are already in combat.
---
Most people dont remember the nerf to UD Strath Side entrance mage farming that took place. Because that whole room had no elites in it but the packs of mobs there still dropped items a group could clean it out very quickly making a ton of gold.
---
I wouldnt put it past people the devs to make that change much to the chagrin of the people claming it should stay in so they can make money doing this over other people who didnt want to roll that class. Or not, well find out.
---
Back in vanilla our primary tanks were Arms. We had progressed thru most of AQ40. Our MT switched from prot to arms, around the time we had MC and most BWL on farm, so that he could enjoy DPSing/PvPing when he was not raiding. I know from the server and guild I was in switching between specs every week was not common and thought as very expensive. 
---
We also did not view flasks as a requirement to raid. Our tanks often used titans and some of the casters would spend their gold occasionally flasking. 
---
As far as the gear and skill levels of the guild I was in, it was not great. We had rogues using daggers to SS, most players used their tier sets, and several people had wonky specs. People were expected to perform a role, not necessarily be a certain spec. 
---
Pretty sure the 40-man coordinating issue has nothing to do with server rules.
---
So, thats mean that he will be on zero armor after 5 stacks of Sunder Armor+FF+CoR! Or just imp.Expose Armor+FF.
---
That was my fear, that private server bosses may actually be harder due to the lack of information.
---
Depending on how rage and threat gen work, then Alcorns Sun Razor is pretty sick even through AQ
---
It has been a long time, but basically, you have to go to a dungeon, summon the horse and defeat it. To summon it, you need a couple of reagents. Getting these costs a fair amount of money, but they aren't consumed. So if one Warlock gets the pieces and saves them, he can go with another warlock and summon the horse. The second Warlock therefore doesn't have to buy/make the components.
---
I feel that, for me having played Alliance more than I have Horde (probably an 85/15% split) that it is a tough choice to play Horde. I know the Alliance questlines, areas, and hubs a lot more. I am also more comfortable with that, plus I really like the aesthetics of the Alliance cities verses the grimy, filthy Horde cities.
---
That being said, I know we're not the same, nor have we had the same playing background in WoW, but I'd say that if you really want to play a Shaman, then you need to just force yourself to stick with it. As mentioned from /u/imirak Savory Deviate Delight is a great option to look Human, but it's ultimately going to come down to how you like the class verses what race you are.
---
Explore more bosses and compare to pservers values?
---
People enjoy games for different reasons and in different ways.
---
"You are Razelikh, demon" is the best quest in Vanilla imho. Blasted Lands. Requires friends. Great story. 
---
Im afraid that will be...
---
Anyone whose gearing up to raid classic is setting themselves up. You just need to enjoy the game, if youre only goal is to kill kel, then I think your journey will end sooner than you expect.
---
If I'm not mistaken, almost all the set bonuses for the tier 0 set are the same. Except for like the 8 piece bonus. 200 armor is actually decent for cloth wears but really any other dungeon gear is better than that set.
---
They implemented Heritage Armor, why not add a heritage weapon too?
---
I honestly like that races, it's just the orc areas and the constant warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. While the alliance zones are more green, brown, blue. And like you sayed I'm must more familiar with anything alliance related.
---
&gt; grimy, filthy Horde cities.
---
Thunder Bluff is fine
---
It basically means attacking someone in a less than fair way.  Sometimes you can kill gankers, sometimes you can escape, but you're always at a disadvantage when someone is trying to gank you.
---
Other people have done what OP has done. Its still possible all bosses are 3130 armor
---
I personally can't stand leveling. It's boring, repetitive and a chore. I'll level my two characters to 60 and that's it. WoW is and always has been about the endgame for me.
---
I’m aware of that, but it still doesn’t change that you’re missing a lot of content by willfully ignoring it. There are some super great quest lines and stories out there you aughta check out. 
---
Exactly my point
---
They teased it in the Original trailer and the Tauren used them in Warcraft 3 so it’s not like they never had them 
---
multiboxing requires multiple accounts, which means more $$$$$ for Activision. why would they do anything against it?
---
I get so bored from solo leveling though.
---
Splitting the +healing between them makes a lot of sense.  Either half or whole sounds great.  I really would hate to see no scaling and watching the spell completely die. 
---
This is Reddit
---
Good catch, complete brain fart. I was just talking about BWL and freudian slipped 8/8 (BWL progression).
---
Naxxramas is 15/15.
---
1-30 is my absolute favorite range, for some reason.
---
&gt; Regarding the whole armor /reduction/ discussion, Ive no idea how you would see it be multiplicative. The only mechanics in vanilla (AFAIK) which are multiplicative are the ones which are % based. Say, attack speed. Anything else related to NPCs and (de)buffs is additively, if its a flat amount.
---
Maybe im not remember correctly but i dont remember stacking physical de-buffs for Armor. You could have FF and Sunder or FF and Expose but not FF Sunder and Expose. Going with the same idea that a more powerful spell was applied.
---
Meanwhile I'm clutching my [[Large Red Sack]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=857) with great anticipation.
---
BG rep grinds for gear also
---
Yes definitely. this is correct.
---
There were numerous armor estimations based on videos of Execute damage (which is also flat) which turned out to be ~3600-3700. And the most prominent pservers use ~4600ish values for the majority of bosses. 
---
Not to mention cairne is holding one!
---
That's interesting. The screenshot shows a partial poison resist and skimming through the video I also saw a partial fire resist.
---
The default mangos core only has frost and shadow resistance on KT, 200/100 respectively
---
Not this! THAT!
---
What are the boss armor values for other bosses? I wonder if there's some rule like mage type bosses having less armor.
---
Imagine being suckered into WC3 Reforged.
---
I was always about PVP at the start.  When RP-PVP servers came out, I decided to try it out.  I made a racist paladin.  That's probably top three of my most memorable characters, until my brother got the account banned for *real life* racial slurs.
---
That's off topic.
---
I don't know whether I'm into PVP or PVE right now, getting older makes me less aggressive.
---
Satire has to actually be funny, you know. You can't just be retarded.
---
Wait are you saying in vanilla you needed fire res to fight rag? Because you didnt. The tank wanted some (without sacrificing too much defense) but everyone else should be in their regular gear.
---
R.I.P. 
---
He’s the reason I did Tauren after my main Troll Hunter 
---
Sad they can’t make a simple two handed Totem  
---
Wrong sub, go to wowservers.
---
A Night Elf racial that puts them into stealth as long as they don't move.
---
Pservers can do whatever they want as long as classic wow releases like the true version it's cool
---
I don't mind if hardcore players finish the raids fast if they're good enough to do so it's their reward but I hope they won't complain about no content after
---
His initial statement not abiding by his conclusion is not “nuance” - that’s called being a moron just wanting to call somebody wrong. Try again.
---
In vanilla my server had a bear who had successfully tanked all of mc, all of bwl and some of aq and nax. So its possible (but they aren't nearly as good).
---
Yeah you had to remake the groups, or at least thats how people did it. The finer part of the mechanics wasnt understoos but we knew taking those steps got you from A-&gt;B. But that is neither here nor there, you agree that instance resets was a thing in vanilla which was what I wanted to establish in the first place.
---
Agreed, this is why I don't think anyone should play PVE servers in Classic (not like there was a reason to in Vanilla, either)
---
I let out a hearty guffaw at this comment.
---
We need more people like yourself my good sir. Upvoted!
---
Veterans don’t drop combat, they drop into combat. Airborne REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I ran WoW on a Celeron with 256 MB of RAM and onboard graphics while my regular PC was out of commission.  I got 9 FPS but since WoW is quantized in 400 ms ticks and you don't need to actually aim, that didn't hurt much.  I'm sure with a real computer you could have run several instances easily enough.
---
I've always wanted to make a conflag PVP lock.  
---
Thank you! 
---
Sounds like you know the way brother. Hope too see you out there.
---
It would look ridiculous. 
---
Watch yur beck
---
The fact that pirate server players all rush to the freshest server seems like strong evidence to me that a *lot* of people enjoy the process of levelling and world PvP against roughly equal enemies more than they enjoy endgame activities or levelling in a world full of ganking sixties.
---
&gt; I was a powerleveller in Vanilla when it was retail, I did about a dozen speedruns to 60 (these are 150+ hours each, so I spent over 2000 hours doing it). 7 days /played on most classes is really quick. 
---
Yup, I realize which is why I freely admitted that I don't know if getting to MC to farm trash in week 1 is realistic.
---
&gt; The big thing you need to realise is that quest xp is lower than most pserver values. You also run out of efficient quests and your best bet is often to stay in place and grind mobs for a few hours.
---
I'm also aware of this which is why my leveling route has grind spots everywhere along the way in case XP values aren't accurate (which is what Joanna has said about pserver after about level 30).
---
Thanks for the info though.
---
Evidence?
---
Is it good? No. It can be fun though. Look up drakedog videos.
---
Exactly, fantastically ridiculous
---
I can look for some but I know because I cleared rag hundreds of times in wow. 
---
As long as all range and healers were well spaced out (so the fire balls only ever hit one person) and your were fast to react to the fire elementals the amount of raid damage was actually not that high in that fight. 
---
No, dumb  ridiculous as the model would be completely out of place. 
---
Yes you are correct that tanks used MS as their primary threat ability before its nerf and the Bloodthirst revamp. Was just responding to the statement that guy is saying where Fury Tanks were a meme spec that would be completely useless in Classic, when in Vanilla from 1.6-1.11 literally every single raid tank was Fury speced because Shield Slam didn't have the threat modifier change. 
---
Yes, I am.
---
It's a nice pvp spec that's about it.
---
Enjoy, you're in for a treat!
---
What makes you say that?
---
Are you a fucking retard? Read the patch notes starting from 1.1.1 through 1.12. Here are all the links, get reading and tell me how the 2004-2006 experience will come anywhere close to the resemblance of a private server / classic wow comparison. A private server will practically feel like a copy/paste with classic wow when compared to 2004 vanilla side by side with classic. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.1.1

---
PS are so accurate you would need time and a close eye to find the errors, there are 100's for sure but it still feels like classic in a lot of core ways. Puritans on this board acting like resistance being off means leveling from 1-10 on a PS is less like vanilla than retail where you're dropping  doomguards at lvl 20 and throwing quest item molotovs that hit for 120,000 on mobs that rapidly respawn.
---
We get it, any chance to purity spiral harder and harder and assert your classic wow defined identity is a chance you can't pass up. But for other people diet soda is closer to regular soda than water, and you can make intelligent comparisons from that stand point. NOBODY says it's a 1:1 copy.
---
My problem with playing on horde is that I passionately hate their capitals, both visually and convenience wise. Except TB, which is beautiful, but not that convenient either.
---
Well in classic wow. If you take your mage and pre bis him. You can have him be relavent in everything. Your pre raid Bis has around the same damage as your T2 San the Stam. Couple that with two trinkets. ToEp and, heroic charm. The former being a trash MC drop with the latter being a ZG drop and, you can be a threat to a naxx geared player.
---
I think that is what he means. You can only dabble in raiding and still hang with the big boys. Couple that with how important use items are over just having better gear and, you have a game where you can do anything. Without really ever becoming a real raider. 
---
They're not adding new content to the game. No new single-player story missions, so what you're really paying for is a $30 graphical update. The game itself is the same as it was back in 2002.
---
Yeah, gild that^
---
Ah the stun talent? That actually is pretty handy. 
---
This is NSFW.  
---
I was like 12 running molten core with a 40 man guild. We are in the area with the fire giants that patrol back and forth. I was our second tank. We had decided to take a break and only me and like 3 other people didnt afk. Well I took the time to alt tab to look at some hentai. (I had speakers and no mic). I was enjoying myself until I heard a bunch of yelling by one of the others. I tab back in just in time to see a few fire giants running at me. Since everyone was afk it was a total wipe and when everyone got back the person told them that I pulled the giants and caused the wipe. People were super mad at me yelling and one guy was like "what the fuck were you doing!?!? Masturbating!?!?" As a little kid I was MORTIFIED!! Like how did they know!??! I never raided with them again &gt;.&gt;

19/1/31 pvp vid
---
That's exactly what a lot of people want.
---
No, people want Warcraft 4. Graphical updates and a whole slew of new content and missions to do in the same vein as WC3.
---
Nobody asked for a wc3 remaster, everyone wanted a new game. You can’t pretend you prefer a remaster of wc3 over a brand new game.
---
I see what you did there.
---
We know that private servers are not accurate.
---
There's absolutely no reason to assume that they are easier than "blizzlike" or rather how classic will be, it could just as easily be harder. In fact private servers has attempted to make specific fights harder just because they felt too easy.
---
Is it easier than vanilla? Yes most definitely. Not only do you have 1.12 talents, you also have more than 10 fps, low latency, modern information including complete knowledge of the fights in advance.
---
If blizzard decides to release classic as it is, 1.12 talents with vanilla values, I would recon it will be easier than private servers. However I think blizzard isn't dumb enough to do that, I think they will buff it to make it feel more vanilla-like. 
---
If you're new to WoW you won't notice any difference between pservers and classic
---
I was really slow to hit 60 on my rogue because I was a teenager and was only allowed to play a few hours a day and used my time incredibly inefficiently because I didnt like grinding mobs and questing that much. Looking back the gameplay just wasn't a great fit for my interests at the time. 
---
What did appeal to me was running dungeons, getting cool loot, and pvp. It wasn't until after I hit 60 that I became aware my server was an EU server with a timezone difference of several hours. Turns out the hours I usually played were something like 2-5am on my server's time. Never did understand why that was one of the top recommended servers when I first made my account. 
---
It made it really hard to find groups for dungeons to even hunt down prebis gear, and raiding was completely out of the question. Pvp was out of the option as a rogue unless I geared up better. I didnt have it in me to go from 1-60 again, I think I got as far as 30 as a hunter and maybe 20 on a warrior and a mage on different servers. 
---
That embarrassing wow moment was the end of my wow career. I ran ZG once and only ran lbrs and scholo a few times, maybe a couple ubrs runs too. Now that I'm older and have more of an appreciation for mind numbing grinds I'm looking forward to being able to see more of that end game content 
---
Default mangos is very very limited because it tries to emulate vanilla perfectly instead of "close enough". So just because mangos doesn't have FR does not mean private servers or vanilla doesn't have FR.
---
But private servers are intentionally making all the gameplay easy to make money!
---
/s
---
mage, lock and hunter are all good in PvP and PvE. They have a place in top tier raid groups and PvP premades. Just play whatever you like.
---
True, WC4 would be preferable. But Blizzard is dead, we will likely never get new quality games from them again.
---
the groups all laugh at me when i ask, i just want to be smart
---
I don't think that would be worth the trouble, it would be a miniscule effect, not worth the hassle.  
---
Oh god. The pain... miss miss parry dodge. I discovered that a weapon swap macro to something fast just to knock that final hp off helped a bit!
---
Imagine being this obtuse
---
&gt; I can look for some but I know because I cleared rag hundreds of times in wow.
---
Amazing. Because vanilla Rag only existed for a little over one hundred weeks, and for the first twenty of those weeks nobody had downed him.
---
Were you also a Rank 15 double Gladiator who killed Kel'Thuzad hundreds of times?
---
Portals, food and drinks for free.
---
Nah I'm a realist
---
Exact same
---
N0rthdale u pussy bitch
---
I think the frost mage pve spec and frost mage pvp spec are pretty different. You might want to look at that before choosing
---
Poor thing 
---
There is a break off point at 11 skill difference in weapon skill (player) and defense skill (mob). Where any difference of 11 or greater, results in a flat 1% extra chance to miss and every point difference counts for 0.4% chance to miss. Whereas any skill difference of 10 or lower, only result in a 0.1% miss chance per point difference.
---
I.e 305 weapon skill = 3% hit. 1 + (0.4 \* 5 = 2) = 3%
---
To boil it down to in in game behavior you should follow:  
---
If no +5 racial: Don't attack mobs +2 your level unless your weapon skill is maxed.  
---
If +5 racial: Don't attack mobs +3 your level unless weapon skill is maxed.
---
If you level up to level 20, you will have 95/100 weapon skill. Whereas mobs two levels above you will have 110/110 for 15 point difference. Effectively 3 level difference. In fact, upon leveling up your experience gain will slow down in practice as you gain less experience killing an equal level mob, but without having acquired the 5 extra weapon skills yet.
---
This was a fairly common quest for paladins because at the end you get linkens boomerang or something like that. It was the only way you could range pull as a paladin. 
---
Not really! 
---
Pservers are intereted to cockblock content, to force people to play longer, so higher armor, lower drop rates is things pservers are interested for.
---
If you'll do its ez people will stop playing very soon.
---
I'd play a private server if I didn't worry it could get shut down at any point.
---
Didn't shell out the money for the demo.
---
Going in blind after not playing (5 mins here or there on private servers over the years but never made it past lv 5) since vanilla
---
And I am of the mindset that we should punish them for being lazy and greedy. Reforged is a quick cashgrab, plain and simple. 
---
They saw an oppertunity to cash in without requiring any special amount of work or investment.
---
Buying reforged sends a clear message: ”Yo Kotick, I love this plate of shit you have served me. Please may I have more?”
---
Got link? Would be interesting to see it.
---
People are going to struggle with blizzard not holding your hand through quests. 
---
Your right I was wrong - it was a long time ago. 
---
Dozens of times. Although we did have 2 mc raids going a week for a while. 
---
At first we did try and use fire res gear but then we learned it was better to have better dps.
---
And no I never PvPed and didnt kill Kel Thuzad in vanilla (quit shortly after nax came out then went back in wrath)
---
If I remember correctly the extremely widespread misconception (I remember arguing about this with people in vanilla) that you needed high fire res came from a handful of things - melee not knowing when to back out, range not spreading out enough, people standing in spots where it's easy to get knocked back into lava also people just not being coordinated enough to kill the sons in a timely organized way. Once you got the strategy down the raid damage was not actually all that high.
---
Chromie: " It's a secret to everyone" \*you receive rose tinted glasses\*
---
Does it really, though? Only the mages in the raid are cutting time. Every other buff class still buffs at the original rate. Amirite? Correct me if I am wrong.
---
Ofc it is. Maexxna was 3750 armor (hunter pet lore data).
---
Anyway imp. Expose Armor+FF+CoR+Annihilator burns 4300 armor, makes any boss zero armor target dummy. 
---
And how is classic wow any different?
---
It’s fun. That makes it viable.
---
I wonder. There is the engineering cloaking device, doesn't that drop combat? You could shadowmeld right after in theory if you are a night elf.
---
I'm almost positive it was split between the main heal and hot. The uncertainty is that the % of the split was.
---
Burning steppes obviously...
---
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Because people asked for classic wow 
---
I mean, if you don't accidently walk from Ashenvale into Felwood and get wrecked at least once, you've never lived :)
---
Probably because levels are still in bite sized pieces in that range. It starts to take entire sessions pretty quickly after that
---
I love this and would hang this in my office.
---
I mean, objectively you are missing out on content (horde quests).
---
But it’s a game and what’s most important is that you have fun. As long as that’s happening then does it really matter?
---
(I agree with you though, horde settlements usually don’t even compare to alliance ones. Barrens is a *good* settlement, just to give you an idea)
---
I’ve played horde like 95% of my WoW life. So I’m going alliance this time around. I’ve done those quests so many times. I want to do some different quests as well as see a different aesthetic this time around. 
---
