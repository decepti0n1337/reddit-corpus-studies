&gt;god damn it's tedious adding 40 min to any dungeon of corpse running.
---

---
Can you elaborate?
---
---
---
Seal of command probably can because I’ve heard that counts more as an extra melee attack, righteousness however does not
---
Guess you're so dumb you couldn't do shit with no addons, could you? Well, it's okay bro. Not everyone was born intelligent. You can use them.
---
Ele is the best and only really good pvp spec for shamans. It’s like half healer half DPS though. But if you play a shaman prepare to heal about 75% of the time, drop totems to make your more important allies do more.
---
I mean, all horde races look like shit. It's only fitting.
---
I've seen that arguement elsewhere that people are "so surprised" that PvP servers turned so hostile in phase 2. Had anyone done their homework they would have watched a few videos about classic phases and realized quite quickly that if you weren't playing the game pretty hardcore you were gonna get farmed.
---
If anyone is bitching and whining right now. Take a break. Come back in 3 weeks when BGs hit and the world will be in a much more balanced state.
---
Lol.
---
Yeah sometimes the future isn’t that great...
---
Final rest of all allies we eat.
---
Nightfall is the only way to add value in a raid situation. It comes out in phase 3. Getting Nightfall and a set of totems from one raid slot is very valuable.
---
As for dungeons: You could tank them. Shaman tanks aren't meta and a lot of people will laugh at you, but you will shut them up really quickly once you tank a dungeon successfully.
---
Yea but have you heard of PortHub on Stalagg
---
You need to learn why itemization exists in the first place instead of making a reddit post asking a specific question.
---
MP5 is not highly weighted for any fight in current dungeons/MC raid content because fights just do not last long enough for that specific stat to have a high value.
---
What that translates to is that pure +healing, int and +mana are much higher weighted than MP5.
---
Hide of wild has higher +healing and int, the fight would have to be over 5mins long for the two items to become near equal, and in much longer fights the +healing and +mp5 item would edge slightly ahead.
---
As a resto druid you should be sitting very near to 600+ healing in prebis and casting spells that cost 130-160mp for around a 1100 heal. There is no way you should be totally OOM by the time a fight is over even if you casted constantly, even if you factored in using larger heals and spamming hots, this is easily covered by mana restoring consumables.
---
+healing and downranking is just too strong to be beaten by mp5 at this point in the game and probably ever with how much the content is being destroyed in under a min.
---

---
Grinding can actually be more lucrative in terms of xp and gold per hour if you're doing it right.  Plus most quest rewards are pretty useless so you're just as likely to see an upgrade grinding.  When you vendor after a session you get a huge spike in gold compared to a quest reward of 2 or 3g.  
---
Really the only thing you don't get is the xp spike at the end but that doesn't matter since your xp per hour is the same.  You're just feeling the effects of the reward in the skinner box.  Once you realize it's a manipulation it no longer matters to you.
---
The fact that the gold is shown as "15g 59s 91c" instead of the little icons
---
Fucking next level shit post.
---
The gold, where are the little icons?!
---
Man I miss the times with no bis item lists and guides.
---
I doubt they make that much money doing it.  I mean there are always 10 mages in IF trying to sell portals it seems like.
---
You can farm 40-50g an hour in Mara as a warlock pretty easily.
---
Yes, or 100% or your HP, or a miss, or an even greater failure as displayed on this video. I'd rather choose guaranteed melee range and a free auto attack coupled to possible procs than maybe a good damage or just my own death.
---
Waking up at 6.30 on a Sunday because your colation needs you to turn in Onyxia's head at 6.45 in order to keep the world buff on a tight schedule...
---
Name checks out
---
Battlegrounds arent pvp? Right...
---
Ele shaman is *very* good in PvP.
---
Tons of utility and they demolish other casters, especially those reliant on a single school of magic.
---
Earth Shock, Frost Shock, Flame Shock, Grounding Totem, etc they're just really solid all the way through and match up neutrally or favorably to nearly every class.
---
It is, arena is the only competitive thing on both TBC and vanilla
---
Lol no. Battlemasters were added a month after BGs were added, in the BWL patch. We're in patch 1.12, so we're good. We're also getting cross realm battlegrounds.
---
No clue why anyone would ever roll on that server
---
Grid.
---
They can go out and try to kill anybody. But everybody will be in BGs with instant queue. So, beside that waiting in their long queue, they will not be able to kill anyone.
---
Then, the minority faction will become a faction squad with their pvp rewards and they will gank back anyone on open worldfrom the majority faction as retribution of the past.
---
1v1 is where I go with pvp
---
I just rerolled benediction with some friends, so far it’s been a really great server!
---
[deleted]
---
Thank you for this throughout answer.
---
Oh, sorry to hear that man :/ I know how you feel, it was the same for me. Seems I was lucky to have a way out then!
---
Honestly I feel like if you follow a levelling guide you can get back up to where you are fairly quickly if you're 48 rather than a geared 60 ... but it sucks that you even have to think about it. Good luck whatever you choose.
---
Man I miss Ruined. Best times I had raiding.
---
I played when the AV queues were 90-120 minutes. This is going to be a cakewalk. ;)
---
If you’re making this connection it you’ve been playing too much wow.
---
It sure change the dynamic of the gameplay, but from my point of view there is no downside to it
---
I don't think anyone should be surprised at all no. Really crazy in my opinion if anyone is surprised. Definitely going to play less until BG's hit so I can actually finish my questing experience...but the problem remains. A lot of people will take that break and will forget about Classic altogether, something I really don't want to happen. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess, but I really don't think there would have been a problem had honor and BG's been released at the same time. Maintains the classic experience while not putting nearly as many roadblocks in new and casual players path on their way to 60. Unfortunately it will be another 3 weeks before I will be able to really join the community at level 60.
---
Ah thanks I'll check it out
---
lol at the pirated copy of windows
---
Professions or bandages on FPs
---
Probably true
---
I too went straight to braids.
---
Well idk about this big dick 60g by 23 dude but I got 39g on my 25 rogue right now. I have skinning/mining as profs and I just vendor everything I gather. I may have given myself some 14 slot bags from my main first, that certainly helped.
---
*Laughs in pve server
---
Hmm, never really thought of it like that. I guess I just don't have the drive, there IS a degree of instant satisfaction that I enjoy from quests and miss while grinding. I know that's situational since not everyone is like me and doesn't change the game at all, but I just end up firing up another game while I'm grinding, and then at some point I remember I've been on WoW afk at the spirit healer for 20 minutes xD
---
just need 300 water, drink just before each tick of mana, and keep running.
---
Hmmm
---
&gt;*ask people who played throughout vanilla and then tbc*
---
I *am* one of those people. You make a lot of suppositions in your comments.
---
Not really no.
---
They can pass if you put a lot of effort into farming bags full of MCPs from gnomer and make liberal use of powershifting but in general you'll be putting in a lot of extra effort just to be on par with the weakest pure damage dealers who've been slacking off.
---
Yea I’m right there with you, can’t complain about it because I chose PVP so I just stopped logging on. Maybe at 3am I can do some questing to level but do I really want to do that? No I don’t.
---
On another note it definitely is a good time to start a tank and get through the low levels just so I feel I’m not wasting my $15 a month just to get corpse camped.
---
Definitely have considered joining you on one of them ! lol
---

Enhancement shaman is not even recognizable anymore. They’ve made every class into a builder spenders with combo points because apparently that’s what makes classes engaging... TBC enhancement was the most fun because it improved every aspect of the spec without destroying the soul of the specialization😢
---
I used to play horde back in vanilla, alliance this time around. I have gone out of my way to run this dungeon at level and solo as 60 for enchanting mats and mindless farming just because I love the aesthetic of the place.
---
Super job on capturing that vibe and tone of this place. Thanks again for always sharing your art with this community!
---
So happy I have a character on Grobbulus for this exact reason.  Probably the most convenient player service in any game I have ever played.
---
I think you're making a case for shadowmeld being the most useful alliance racial, lol
---
That is cool. I dont really care. Doing instances in pug is a poor money maker. It is a very time consuming and unreliable method of making gold. Sounds like you will just get kicked from any group I am in. Play how you want. Nobody really cares about your situation since you are in the minority. Most people doing a dungeon are doing it for a specific gear drop. Tanks will continue to get stuff on reserve, and honestly it will probably only get worse as many more switch to fury/arms, bgs come out, and less and less tanks are bothering to run dungeons since they are full MC kitted.
---
I couldnt tank golem as a 54 druid tank
---
iirc there was a pserver that tried this and warriors were the undisputed best.
---
With interest?
---
You are just focusing on a specific aspect without considering the larger picture.... You think lower levels are fucked..... how about 60s with poor gear.... how about 60s without a permanent group of raid geared zerg buddies....
---
Vanilla wow, classic wow, whatever you wish to call it has always had SHIT unbalanced world pvp. The more prepared side with better class balance and larger numbers always wins.
---
This is the main reason why people enjoy premades in BGs, because it eliminates a few of the factors that make world zergs so unbalanced.
---
Your crying and complaining does nothing, because most of the veterans already know everything you said. We also know that everything is amplified greatly be the Omegapop server size that blizzard decided to use.
---
&gt;Listening to twitch streamers and random redditors
---
You have only yourself to blame.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pro tip - farm in azhara instead, did my 50-55 grind there back in week 1, squared my away for a decent while.
---
Most class discords have good lists
---
On my server, the horde camps you from the moment you land at the flight point until the moment you enter the dungeon. It’s a cycle of rez, run 5 steps, get killed, then run back to your body and repeat until you get to the dungeon. So a 5 minute ride from the flight point to the dungeon now takes at least 40 minutes due to the release of phase 2.
---
And the worst part is that the only way to level now is to do dungeons because horde raids are constantly running around in all 50+ zones killing and camping anyone they see.
---
I did the same.  Kinda miss my orc but its hella nice being able to fly to BRS in 3 minutes....
---
Fight me.
---
Because you like men.
---
 Congratulations! I remember as a child farming for months and months trying to get all the pieces for my druid because my dumb ass thought it was a good set and I wanted to look like a bird for some reason. I clearly remember the boots from the spider boss in LBRS never dropped and I couldnt finish the set before BC.  I’m pretty sure I cried a few times.
---
Man, if only most of the top rated arena players weren't alliance....
---
Same it’s my last piece  and I think you meant Urok
---
You should never have more than one mob autoattacking you if you vanish immediately after a resist and don't move. After the first swing from a Picpocket resist, it will take another 1.5s~ for another swing to go off.
---
In that time, other mobs will aggro in that range most likely. 
---
If you do it correctly, the sequence of events will go Pickocket resist---Mob Autoattack---Vanish---additonal mobs move towards you---They path back to original location.
---
That is pretty good for thorium. On my server it is like 3g a stack. Sounds like a stronger economy. If you are running guildies, split profits and make it efficient. If its pugs, I don't let any other miners in the group
---
Yes, I'm aware of it too. Does that mean im gunna shut up about it? No I love classic wow and want it to be relevant for a long period of time.
---
Agreed, love how it feels to time other actions between autos and not loose dps. Hunter auto attacking is even more satisfying whiten you’re kiting somebody in pvp and manage to pull off couple cheeky shots.
---
They are Emerald Dragon raid bosses area for saving Eranikus (Sunken Temple boss) as part of the The Sceptre of the Shifting Sands questline. (To open the Scarab Wall to enter Ahn'Qiraj for the server)
---
There's actually four locations like it in the world with here in central Duskwood, very NE Ashenvale, very NE Hinterlands and the very North, and slightly East of the main road, in Feralas. Even before the dragons themselves are put into the game with the AQ patch these areas are crawling with level 58+ elite green dragonkin akin to the blues in Azshara, reds in Wetlands or blacks in Burning Steppes.
---
These are actually the same Dragons of Nightmare from the Legion Emerald Nightmare raid.
---
You chose that, you must've been aware of it's completely massive overpopulation before and while you rolled on it.
---
Booo
---
Maybe try Opie
---
r/angryupvote
---
Of course.
---
Really sad to hear the show is ending. Work is gonna be a lot more boring without it. If they announce tbc next year who will countdown to it?):
---
Did I post this and forget? This is me 100%.
---
Pretty sure it's just a "disable server notifications" toggle in settings.
---
I don’t play games for any of the reasons you state.  That also wasn’t the meta then.
---
It's one of the things I love the most about classic.  Money actually means something
---
Edit: a word
---
Excuse my ignorance because I've never raided with a healer but why would there be a debate on the role of shaman of all classes? Doesn't chain heal put them squarely in the raid heal bucket? I know on horde side it's a little more fuzzy because we don't have paladins which are definitely tank healers, but I would figure priests are default tank healers on horde. What do shaman do better?
---
"Trust me, I've talked to people on multiple servers, I know what people want."
---
Ok bro
---
actualy i stoped to play at pvp patch.
---
&gt; However, I do believe that him as an officer and a tank should want the best for his guild, which will be helping his healers and dps in dungeons. That sometimes means dropping personal farms or putting extra time into the game for others.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Especially if the guild is pooling gear to the tank, then his reason for not needing anything from dungeons anymore is because what they achived as a guild in raids.
---
Very much this. Helping out guild members for the greater good of the guild should be a very high priority for everyone who actually cares and is serious about their guild's raid team, especially for someone in a prominent position such as officer/GM, and even more-so if they are a tank who is being funnelled gear from raids.  
---
OP isn't necessarily an asshole in this situation (because it really isn't much to ask that they would get to claim any of the gear that the others don't need, for disenchanting), but they really should rethink their stance on the situation, and consider the guild's best interest.
---
I just updated my UI and been messing around with these modifiers on my priest. I can hold shift to downrank heal spells, but I can’t click ‘1’ for example but have to mouseclick it. Is there a way to do that? 
---
Also is there a way to set up one click desperate heals on a mouse button without also having to over my character?
---
It's better to just bitch about it now and then reminisce about it 15 years later, talking about the "glory days" while completely ignoring the fact that you're an Alliance scum.

I have a binding of the windseeker as a gnome and the sword is gonna be bigger than my character.
---
I’m sure you are a very small minority
---
Im in this weird spot in retail where i can easily find a guild for normal and hc raids but no matter how i do, i can't find a guild to even try mythic raids in. It seems like the step from hc to mythic is so huge that people want absolutely 0 randoms in.
---
I still enjoy the harder difficulty of retail tho
---
If we made and ally one you would be tea bagging the lion.

My bad. Savage Gladiator Chain

Windfury gives extra weapon hits. Anything that procs off weapon hits will work.

I like how you remade the thread so you could hide your pirated copy of Windows 10 lol
---
its built within Auctioneer mate. cheers
---
Slightly unknown but BRD has has the BIS ammo pouch and pre-raid BIS quiver and even now with Phase 2 getting that Rhok'Delar quiver is a hell of a challenge too.
---
best thing is: do you know why it has this strange crescent form? In the middle of it was the former nightelven capitol city called azshara that imploded because of demon stuff
---
I'm 38 on faerlina and yeah it fucking sucks but holy shit have I had so much fun so far in p2
---
DM east jump runs are about 50g an hour. You need a healer to go along with you, but if you are in a guild you'll be able to find one trying to make some money. Once you get enough capital (~300g), flip items like greater fire protection potions, winterfall firewater, and mongoose elixirs during non peak times (12am Wednesday) and sell them during peak raiding times (6-7pm on Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday) you can easily double your money doing this.
---
Good luck you broke bastard
---
That was a thing going for me till I got moved to 2nd shift 😤
---
Yea because they’re not drowning in gold enough already
---
actually a worthy experiment, I may try this.
---
I was doing this too. I have four toons under level 40.  The idea of having to do Barrens a fifth time was enough for me to not make another alt
---
N E T L A U N C H E R
---
they dont. Its the truth. when you can be replaced instantly by someone who isnt going to whine about reservations, you bring no value. You fail to consider things from the tanks perspective. Try it out. if you like it, you can be the hoighty toighty morally superior tank you seem to think exists.
---
One annoying thing I've noticed on my druid is if I log out while in stealth, when i log back in, I'm out of stealth, and I have to wait the entire stealth cooldown before i can re-stealth.
---
&gt;Roughly the same travel time as the flight path if you have 100% mount
---
????
---
Does the timer for your HS go down while offline?
---
Its weird on my server. Alliance is the smaller faction, but they have all the big pvp guilds that legit dominate BRM and everything. I am just waiting for them to give up under the sheer pressure of being heavily outnumbered time and time again. I want them to break and be able to play in peace. Sure, if the alliance is erased eventually no more 1v1s for fun in the open world, but also 5 times as much no more 5v1 gank fests. A price I am willing to pay.
---
Can you invite them to groups?
---
&gt; for horse fury 
---
NEIGH
---
Thank you so much for the response!
---
Some sort of discussion definitely makes sense, really hard to figure out everything by my own. Also we aren't really that strict with either loot nor the raiding, but I like to be prepared and don't really want to "waste" an item, if that's even possible.
---
Some folks like to make it seem like an Staff of Dominance on a mage would be the end of the world and I don't know if that is true or just an exaggeration.
---
Thanks again!
---
Xaryu was a great suggestion. And because the duel tournament has been going on here has in depth looks into his fights with most the classes and what to do and when in 1v1 situations.
---
Also, the current end game in classic was not originally played with gear that had any spell or healing power on it (added in a later patch) and the talent trees for many classes (any other druids remember speccing into innervate with 31 points in resto tree?) were super broken.
---
I'm not surprised MC is "REALLY EASY" in a patch of the game that was way later than it was originally introduced.
---
Well played.
---
The kind of person dumb enough to enjoy retail is also dumb enough to come tell all of us about it, checks out. 
---
Good luck on your loot boxes this week.
---
Or something like "The horde disposes of shit"
---
To be fair, it never really becomes that hard from an individual perspective. Classic WoW is mostly about how much effort you put in and how prepared your guild is for the content. Good guilds are still going to walk through AQ like its nothing.

You need engineering. For the basic grenades to give you 3s to slam a Fire Nova + CL + ES combo uninterruptible. Other engineering toys unlock more options.
---
In general, EShaman's biggest weakness is lack of CC to peel melee off you to get casts in. You need to mitigate that with a bigger toolset from engineering and other pvp items (tidal charm is OP for EShaman).
---
People wouldn't be misremembering Naxx because so few vanilla players and guilds could measure up to even enter the place.
---
Warlock or warrior
---
Stoneclaw totem can disable stealth, but I mean, mail users can handle  rogues and cat form druids pretty well, as a tauren i can easily fight back after a stomp
---
&gt;The game doesn't become hard until AQ and Naxx.
---
The game never really becomes hard at least for PvE. The raiding content of classic was really a step below everything Blizzard made after that. Not a lot of people did them, they didn't invest a lot of effort into the development of them and it shows.
---
Because its the best server in NA?
---
If you arent saying O K B O O M E R to horde are you even playing the game?
---
yes
---
That's a myth that fast 1h has higher consistent dmg. It's consistently MEH dmg only.
---
I’m sorry, I’m super new. How do I asked world? Lol
---
That's good to hear, as horde is feels a bit too horde-favored, but hopefully not oppressively so.
---
I love the rhythm of auto attacks, especially as a hunter. Going in for a big melee hit/CC feels great as well.
---
You can estimate a distribution you moron. Go back to school.
---
Hmm, if they sell for something like 30g I would just equip them, any more and sell
---
Yes, they can also be parried, blocked, or miss
---
See that character mitigation? Problem solved.
---
Those episodes were seriously creepy.
---
Happy cake day
---
Yea well i’ve played too many games where the low pop servers are a ghost town a few months in( like some of the servers they created for migration btw). Figured the hype might die down, I was wrong.
---
Will always take high pop over low tho. 
---
It’s just annoying, i’m too invested now to transfer off. Just wish they could figure out how to get another 1000 people or so in the server.
---
But there is Warlock movie already and it's awesome.
---
Why? Dude have you looked at the stats?
---
I suspected this, we tested it a little, even having a feral druid come in and out of range of giving me LoTP, the enemy could see that and know I was close, which is completely broken. Havent checked anything about it since the update, but it is definitely seems nerfed
---
Same
---
if the tank advertised first 2 orbs res the whole time, giving the 3rd (if it even drops) to the rogue might break the deal for the rest of the people he has already recruited.
---
HELLO TANK
---
Upvoted for sake of your lungs and throat
---
Holy shit thanks a lot, I'll get on all of that right away! Ive read about dme jump runs but didnt think about the flipping. Lionheart doesnt seem so far away now, thanks.
---
Good luck to you too, you (presumably) rich bastard

Any way we could track the realm populations of the other EU servers too?

You need to get to BRD and just stay there til you hit like 57 lol

Gutted to hear you're ending the show! Is it a case of you not enjoying classic or just a time thing? 
---
You obviously don't have to answer! Thank you for producing some great content over the last year or so!

Doesn't help, friend. Stay strong, we might be able to play again after December 10

Playing ally on a horde dominated server (razorgore-EU).

"You hear about allys getting ganked and thinking thats me?"
---
I AM THE ONE WHO GANKS!!!
---
Im having a blast. got 12k rp last reset so 40% in on rank 4.
---
Im not stuck here with a horde majority. The horde majority is stuck here with ME!
---
What show?
---
Try modui
---
They arent asking you to do it...
---
I think you are right, with improved Stealth wouldn't make sense for it to be 10 second when zoning in an instance. But does it matter as you stay stealthed when zoning in anyway?
---
Yup, it's exam time for me atm so I have alot of days with no lectures so I've set the alarm for like 4 and grinded for a few hours then take a nap before studying.
---
Toilets don't shit on things? You shit in toilets that's such bad banter mate.
---
Looks like the default bars with the art disabled.  Bartender should be able to do that.
---
The honor they get now is going to be nothing compared to when BGs come out. There is no point going crazy with it now just for honor. They should be doing it for fun.
---
A rogue in naxx gear will almost oneshot any player, speaking as a mage main from vanilla, rogues could kill me before fully phasing out of stealth. Which is why this time around, im gonna be the rogue
---
3 accounts, as many lcoations as he wants. (up to 10 really)
---
tl;dr - Should have picked PVE.
---
Alliance on Fairbanks. Just ended my sub, have 22 hours left and not going back. It’s takes anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour to run any instances because almost every high level FP is being raid camped by groups, and multiple packs of Horde roam the area wiping out anyone they come across. BRM is a joke, where the entire path is lined up with horde waiting to pick off players for easy HKs trying to get inside. Once inside the mountain, horde line the chains, walkways, paths, doorways and just nuke any reds that come in the area. Try to defend yourself? In the next 5-10 minutes another raid group ready to retaliate rolls in. I hopped on an alt and got killed 16 times in a span of 30 minutes while trying to quest. Between getting ganked by groups of 3+ horde against myself (I have not yet had one 1vs1 against the horde) the group of 60s that will sit on your level 33 corpse and hunt you down repeatedly while yelling “gO BaCk tO reTAil” just isn’t enjoyable and not worth playing this graveyard simulator anymore.
---
Can moonkin a use engineering bombs in form or do they have to shapeshift out of form to use them?
---
My favorite as well.
---
Nah the bottom right six buttons are wear the bags should be. I think this is pretty close to the current default UI in retail.
---
make a raid, zerg around. keep moving. Have fun. KILL THEM ALL!
---
Play for more than 10 minutes without visiting the Spirit Healer.
---
Lmao
---
From what people say rogue is better on early
---
phases because people get more health later on. This really contradicts what you say.
---
Only for raids. Groups of 5 within the raid are assigned a number from 1 to 8

Why should players making alts be an issue?  Not like you can log on to two characters at the same time.
---
Please, join Heartseeker if you are Horde! Transfer while you still can.
---
I play Alliance, but I’ve been on this server from the beginning. Many horde have transferred, and it’s actually becoming playable to PvP and feel immersed again as an Alliance player. 
---
I realize most wont due to the massive imbalance of Alliance to Horde, but it is getting better, even if only slightly. World PvP is definitely ramping up, and I would love to see a lot more of it. Also, if your server is TOO HIGH in Horde population, think about the UNLIMITED supply of Alliance to be killed for Honor?
---
Yes, BG's are coming soon, but WPvP will always be around. Think about the opening of AQ, too.......
---
No shit, probably eheroes player lmao
---
ShadowedUF. The texture is from SharedMedia addon also
---
Yes and no. You see the constant shifting due to the Wolfshead Helm that gives energy/rage when shifting into those forms. Look up power shifting.
---
They play very similar to Classic Feral
---
Hundreds of 60's online right now, 50+ in Org, many more out in the World. Plenty of WPvP, too. As you can see in this photo, Horde and Alliance fighting on top of the bank.
---
I think you seriously lack experience of Classic. You can walk up, then channel with time to spare, and start auto attack with a judgement at the end of the channel with no gcd. If you have a beef with death ray backfiring (unfounded imo) then that's another story, but if you wanted to use deathray this is the way to do it.
---
Without it people actually get put into the world. You level with the same people, build a reputation and make friends. The other night I got onto a group and I recognized everyone in the group a d we have all been running dungeons together since SM. Groups like this are like an unofficial guild we know each other and know each others playstyle.
---
Progress used a moonkin in their world record MC speedrun btw
---
ok zoomer
---
Why punch once when you can destroy everything in that little shit’s life? I like your thinking.
---
I just don't think you've thought long enough. There's plenty of unexplored builds in the game. Watch out for a phase 5-6 prot PvP warrior that overtakes MS warriors
---
I didn’t even make it to the honor system lol I couldn’t imagine trying to play on Faerlina as a deep holy priest
---
We had our guild meeting there once. :)
---
Game is hardly playable anyway on 70/30 splits or worse. I'm just raid logging now, probably not going to bother re-subbing until they open transfers. There are a lot better ways to spend few hours instead of corpse running everywhere.
---
lol the irony of call someone a dumbass and writing “feesable” in the same sentence. Nice reply though, all you had in you was a cheap personal attack. Not surprised.
---
And that right there is the point you're missing. It started going *down* the path, it wasn't *on* the path. There is a lot of janky shit in Classic that we tolerate and TBC cleaned up. It was the spirit of Classic with better class design, raid design and dungeon design. 
---
To achieve the same level of care in Classic+, you'd have to dedicate an entire team to effectively making a new expansion. See how quick Blizzard is to jump on that train when TBC, considered one of the best expansions ever, is right in front of them.
---
Autoattacks still exist, but they're like 5% of your damage now. Almost all your damage comes from abilities.
---
Everyone I know already stopped playing. Including myself. Got too boring lol.
---
Yeah i figured that much lol, was really only worried about the other 2.  Is picking up relentless worth 4/5 lethality?
---
With the amount of retail refugees playing classic, it's expected they hate pvp or any kind of pvp event.
---
Kromcrush?
---
I actually like our server, of course there are moments when me and my friends get overwhelmed and of course die but as I return to my corpse I see a party of Ally just throwing down and giving a hell of a fight. Now my friend who is a lvl 51 warrior is having a hard time questing as he is an easy target for Honor and I feel he may had quit had the early announcement for bgs not been brought to our attention.
---
If you wanted someone to punch you could always go to Skettis or Elemental Plateau or other questing hubs. Punching herbers or miners was never that vital to world PvP.
---
The falling leaves stuck out to me. Are leaves animated that way in other zones too?
---
Thank you :)
---
Classic doesn't have sharding and it doesn't use the Legion client
---
Waiting four paid character transfers
---
It won’t. My point is that your gear is no where as good as you claimed. It’s not BiS. It’s not even full pre-BiS.
---
Ulda, ST, and Mara are long dungeons with rewards that only benefit for a limited level span. That means that the player pool is limited. And although a lot of people are game for the long dungeons on their first toon, they may be less willing for the time investment. Best strategy is to spam Trade Chat at peak hours and hope.
---
I’m unironic Lee.
---
You're the only one who seems upset here for rightly being called out as a noob for deciding that not using addons is better somehow.
---
Anyway I've blocked you so I don't have to respond to any more of your dumbass noob comments.
---
Stay bad.
---
Try mixer
---
No.
---
You're saying it's sad for a ret paladin to rely on rng? Do you even know what the class does?
---
You're correct, he's not. He modified the code of bartender, using code from itemrack. So no, there probably isn't an addon like this out yet.
---
You can drag the bars wherever you want with Bartender, and shut off individual pieces of bars.  Bartender could totally do this.  It's literally just the griffon art turned off and the bag and small buttons hidden.
---
I have: Questies, Deadly Boss Mods, Details!, VuhDo, Atlasloot, Atlas, ItemRack, Spy, Auctionator, Bag Brother, Bag Free Space Counter, Classic Aura Durations, Classic Castbar, Classic Threat Meter, Combuctor, Dismounter, OmniCC, RC Loot Council Classic, Real Mob Health, Simple Map, Titan Panel Classic, TomCat's Tours for Classic, Vendor Price, Deja Classic Stats, &amp; Decursive (for my mage alt)
---
We've all dated a girl long enough who... well, just didn't think we'd care.
---
We do.
---
Warlock would use like 45 minute to get to the boss lol.
---
It’s not about it being true. It’s about no one actually gives a shit. 
---
You can clear raids with chars not even level 60.

That face the horde makes when they finally figure out that driving alliance off the PVP servers had a negative impact on the BG queue times.
---
Yep, I'm Horde on Stonespine and it's complete garbage for Alliance. Blizzard really fucked our server up with the free transfers.
---
Download tradeskill manager addon and client. Shows you all current market values from your server and every other server

---

That’s tough lmAo
---
Have you played RBGs before?
---
&gt; ~~diseases~~ alliance will run rampant again
---
Is this the [link](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24977-TrinketMenuClassic.html) for the TrinketMenu add-on or is there another one?
---
Different perspectives. I guarantee you the Horde are doing the exact same thing to alliance players as well. The difference is most pvp servers seem to be primarily horde dominated.
---
Sounds like my experience yesterday trying to run Dire Maul:
---
1. Killed on landing at Feathermoon
---
2. The dock/boat has 10 Horde on it, so we decide to swim. Corpse hop into the water, swim across. Mercifully, the Horde don't follow us into the water.
---
4. Get ganked at the ramp from the beach heading toward Dire Maul. We corpse hop from the ramp to the DM courtyard, with Horde groups along that entire stretch. I die right next to the graveyard and have to wait out a 2-minute rez timer (thanks Blizzard).
---
5. Near the instance portal, our warrior gets chain-mind-controlled and run all the way back to the road.
---
6. Warrior quits group because this has already been an hour and we haven't done the first pull yet.
---
7. Spend 20 minutes finding a new tank
---
8. It takes almost an hour for the tank to corpse hop into the instance. None of us help him because we don't want to go back into that hellhole and we'd just end up corpse hopping alongside him anyway.
---
9. We finish DMN in about 30 minutes.
---
Nah, I tried it, cant make this happen, and i'm pretty sure its not bartender, because bartender doesnt have the little number where you can select which action bar you are using at the main bar
---
found the warlock
---
Lol, I’ve always been curious if alliance ever just camp them.
---
Lol butt bandit is looking at too many toilets
---
I tried playing at 3-5am and I still get killed by poopsocks on the boats or out in leveling zones. Send help
---
Yooo new phone background of my favorite dungeon
---
No man keep doing what you're doing.
---
&gt;Tons of issues for Classic on pservers, but people stuck with it AND people liked Classic enough to actively develop for it and fix issues. That has NOT been the case with TBC pservers.
---
Except it has &amp; you're clueless.
---
Nice
---
Yep, leveling an horde alt now and it's a blast. Or you can just roll on a pve server as alliance. You can always flag for pvp and you can pvp in BGs anyways.
---
Do Mara for thrash blade
---
i would pay for transfer to pve sever, but that will never happend. blizz is doing everything they can to help hordes. how? ali cant transfer from low pop servers (at least somebody posted this here on reddit) and x-realm BG so hordes wont have long queues (will still have since there is world wide unbalance but still...). so.... i gues reroll and fresh start or quit
---
Best place to go for herbalism at 180?

Have friends or a main character send you 55 gold, have gathering professions and sell the mats for the rest.

OP is a pedophile, don't listen to him. He whispered me for nudes and I'm not 18.
---
Logging and parses are fine. They use external logs that aren’t affected by the change.
---
The change definitely affects meters in/game. The only one that matters is threat, especially not healing meters.
---
We're talking about 5-6 times the amount of players here. Given how limited the world is, that's pretty huge.
---
Tell them you’re trying to farm gold atm, and need to wrap that up. If they want you bad they will let you know you can take stuff.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaa , found the alliance.
---
Everyday in org there’s a group of rogues/druids tanking people who fly or hearth in, also most of the flight paths are camped during some potion of the day at least. 5-10 man ally squads running around gambling. I’m Horde, it’s not to bad until raid night. You can forget getting inside a raid with world buffs.
---
Staff of dom on mage is amazing
---
Really depends how many alliance will be left by then. Who actually pvps. Given the current faction imbalance, I fully expect horde to get 45-60 min queues for BGs. So players will still roam and gank while they wait for the queue to pop.
---
I mean, we clear it somewhere between an hour and an hour and a half, and this is about three weeks after our first clear. I guarantee you those hardcore guilds weren’t knocking down their first MC in an hour.
---
&gt; Wotlk is even miles worst than TBC, and already a shitty version of WoW.
---
Once again, take a look at [this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) What you think is bad isn't an universal opinion. In my opinion, the class balance in Vanilla is terrible, as a paladin I can barely deal any damage in dungeons or raids, the raids are far to easy to have to rely on my utilities to progress. That gets progressively better in TBC and WotLK. However, I can see why people thinks that is a good design choice to leave the hybrids for their utility roles.
---
Most of cases if you are poor at classic, you are also poor at retail.
---
Delete this
---
Asses do tend to shit on toilets. Seems about right.
---
Yea 60g at 23 is impossible unless they got sidetracked for 100-200 hours farming some low level shit.
---
My hunter who solo quests without professions, vendoring everything and AH cloth, was about 8 gold in the mid 20s.
---
servers turned hostile in vanilla, in classic there r 4times more ppl than on vanilla servers, ppl knows things they didnt know back than, the game is played much differently. its not the same and its not pvp, its just farming and griefing. and players who say others to stop bitching r hordes on horde dominating servers or 60 who dont have to level in end game zones so they dont knwo whats going on and how hars is to not uninstall the game
---
reroll pve or horde. Easy solution. THen go back and do BGs on your main for instant queues.
---
Also: if you're speccing into the subtlety tree I'd try to take Hemorrhage over improved SS, since it's basically the same as SS but only costs 35 energy.
---
Yeah but wait until you start end game and pay 100g a week respeccing, and if you want to pvp seriously 100g a week in consumes and 140g per week to top dps meters
---
Thanks bro but i'm pretty sure this should break all timers. If it can't see the tick it wouldn't know if it's still active on the target and therefore can't show correctly unless it just assumes it stays on the target regardless in which case it would keep the timer going even if dispelled. 
---
I'm sure they will figure out some patches for this stuff though once mods update
---
Gnome racial is BiS for warrior druid &amp; warrior shaman (Druid/Warrior being thé most dominant comp throughout the expansion). Human racial is also great on rogue, especially in 3v3 &amp; double dps teams where the opener often decide who wins. Night elf racial is great on hunter (can macro to stealth drink in combat). 
---
Just sayin', it's not as black and white as you think. If you look at the tbc arena servers before they went down, the faction balance was relatively even with lots of comps favoring alliance racials.
---
Link ur build
---
I'm not sure but I think moveanything might do what you want. That is, keep the (ugly D:&lt;) default frames but make em smaller.
---
But you can get 2k gold from one world quest
---
What’s vital to WPvP then?
---
Hey I don't even have an epic mount don't lump us all together
---
Alliance or horde?
---
Come join us!
---
o n e    o f   u s
---
Well with such a rebuttal like that, clearly you dismantled all my points and proved me wrong. well played.
---
I was just responding to saying it looks like the default UI.
---
Yeah especially when the game first came out I wanted to dedicate all my time to it. Haha
---
Imagine giving a shit about this crap
---
I’m horde brother but if your alliance we could always have a friendly duel :) I can meet out front of if or wherever
---
TBC is far superior in countless aspects except for one or two debatable points like flying or resilience.
---
PvP over resources is a huge part of wpvp what the fuck are you smoking brother
---
**personal nodes killed this too
---
Skeram?
---
Because it's well known how to get Jed and one person might not be able to get it. Only lazy entitled players expect Jed to be found when the person spamming is trying to put runs together
---
You mean world of genocide? Alliance is being ethnically cleansed
---
Should have*
---
Let's go by the numbers we have, since it is impossible to know the exact number of people who wants TBC over Classic(which I never claimed to know). TBC and WotLK had huge subscriber counts, just like with Vanilla, a small portion of those players too wanna relive old expansions. A peak of 12 million players during WotLK, around 50% higher than the peak during Vanilla. 
---
I agree that TBC had things that even I don't agree on(flying, badges), but contents and changes still leans it on the positive side. Balances to classes were a breathe of fresh air. I am only playing Classic now because retail is an irredeemable mess, if there was a TBC option I would bail this instant. When/if TBC releases, don't be surprised if Classic shrinks to a few servers, people want new content that are proven. The 5k-10k people who reroll on fresh Vanilla servers on the private server are a minority.
---
Then you are definitely playing the game wrong when it comes to making money while leveling lmao.
---
probably rouge....
---
The pve servers are significantly smaller then the PVP servers and there are several PVE servers that lean horde, its not going to balance anything out.
---
Big grats on this one brother!!! Been trying for a few weeks for that trinket but to no avail.
---
&gt; We've all dated a girl long enough who... 
---
Would let ya do her while she's on the terlet
---
Those coordinates are where *you* were when the person was spotted. Not where they were.
---
I believe there is a harvest timer. If I recall, you have to wait 30mins or so before you can harvest again regardless of how many you cleanse. Some one else can probably clarify better.
---
RAISE THE POP LIMIT!!
---
considering the timing of this post, that's really saying something.
---
You cant lose honor in pvp lol
---
Another DPS can't rebirth or innervate.
---
Is that legal?
---
Go to retail
---
I think you’re incorrect about not being able to summon yourself. A lock in my group the other day needed to repair, summoned himself, then hearthed and accepted the summon after his repairs.
---
Kinda points out the real problem. Even if we magically redistributed everyone horde would still have enough population to dominate every server hard enough that people would still be unhappy.
---
How? The game is so barebones, so on rails, its LITERALLY a mobile game on pc. Would honestly be concerned if i were you and found  that entertaining
---
Funny, I'd love to farm blackrock stronghold in Burning Steppes without the local 5-ally deathsquad thats' looking for Black Lotus finding me on Spy and seeking me out like a laser-guided missile, even if I leave the outside orcs untouched so it looks like no one is there.
---
Keep in mind the 6% is catered to having full world buffs in raids and maintaining near 100% uptime on heroic strike for the "bug" if you wanna call it that. 
---
Having a bit more for when you lose buffs or aren't fully raid buffed isnt a bad idea.
---
I pvp dps and raid heal as the 30/0/21 spec mentioned. Works great, no complaints.
---
I don't see a toilet seat I see a proper gaming chair
---
They should do wotlk+
---
Alliance warrior on Mograine. Although we're basically outnumbered, some coordinated smallish alliance pvp groups, usually guild groups, will occasionally push back the horde. So the 20% of the time when there's not a herd of 20 thirsty horde roaming at Light's Hope, the game feels glorious. 
---
Also i've spent so much time gearing up and so much time getting my face smashed because a lone warrior is basically a dead warrior, that i'm now, plain and simple, out for revenge.
---
I hate seeing horde in menethil and theramore making it impossible to travel, i hate seeing rogues gank people in ironforge, i hate landing in morgan's vigil to 20 horde and a dead flight master.
---
So now that i can swing my sword around and demolish those same hordes, especially those i have on my shitlist, it comes as long awaited justice. It's an uphill battle, but when i see that undead body hit the ground after a meaty execute... that's why i still play.
---
I honestly am trying to clear my entire map of quests so I’m doing all the chains and it’s decent gold and fun also.
---
I use Questie and I can move the map to the continent view and see any quests I am eligible to pick up.
---
Wow I didn’t know the horde emblem was the same shape as the Alliance. Nice to know!
---
Incredible. I didn’t even REALIZE this, but you’re absolutely right. This is 10000% a part of the game that I love and didn’t realize was part of the reason I loved it.
---
Pacing. Cadence. The ability to take time and think about what button to hit vs. just smashing whatever was available. 
---
Well done. Thanks for making everyone think and appreciate this.
---
Long live auto attacks!
---
Upvoted for hot Faerlina goss
---
Another resto druid can though.
---
That and invis pots for non-engies
---
Did you check if he was godsub tho?
---
Weared
---
Under khara? Wait - thought that was a TBC instance, you can go there in classic?
---
I'll probably be doing that too eventually, right now I've got other things higher prioritized, also world PvP is making it hard on my server
---
To what extent is keyboard macros considered exploitative by the anti-cheat?   
---
It is possible to use pick pocket macros that loot the target closest to you, and if you could automatically execute that macro every time you stopped moving, you could make pick pocket farms much less click-intensive. As far as I know, you cannot do anything move-related in the ingame-macros though.  
---
However, if you place the pick pocket macro on the key 1, for example, then you could bind you keyboard to press 1 every time w, a, s and d is lifted. That would result in an auto-pick pocket of the closest mob every time you stopped moving. You would simply be moving around stopping when in suitable range and be a pick pocket monster, only moving and not having to press the pick pocket key yourself.  
---
I've seen that automation has gotten people into problems before from searching just now, but I'm so enticed by this idea that I wanted to ask/discuss it before letting it go.  
---
PSA: if you're to try this out now, be careful that you're not reliant on your w, a, s and d keys for turning your keyboard back to normal.
---
This explains everything that has ever happened.
---
Classic has a hundred more game design issues than TBC
---
Her exact response was “well those are how I make money too.” She was a mage. It was also the instance that made me make this post as a sanity check
---
&gt;Just sayin', it's not as black and white as you think. If you look at the tbc arena servers before they went down, the faction balance was relatively even with lots of comps favoring alliance racials.
---
Is this true? My understanding was that the major TBC servers have always been massively horde sided, which is why they usually use faction-based queues (which people have now been recommending for certain horde dominated servers in classic).
---
Ok boomer
---
Alliance good, horde bad.
---
I certainly do not, and as far as I'm aware my guild doesnt either
---
Is the Hearthglen escort the one that starts at Tirion? If not do that questline, it rewards an awesome ring.
---
Did they get 60? Get all pre bis? Get all raid bis? Do they not pvp? There’s plenty to do to not get bored if you enjoy the game
---
O K Z O O M R , My enjoyment increased 10 fold when I learned I can reply with that.
---
Same happens with shadow meld.
---
What is your guild's MC clear time in warcraft logs?
---
75% horde on my server. Every boat has a 5-10 man squad, same with flight points in 40+ zones. The game is legitimately unplayable. I went from spending most to all of my gaming time playing to basically raidlogging.
---
Phase 4 there will be something. Or, rather, someone.
---
Looks like an Unforged Seal of Ascension, part of the UBRS key quest line. You have to place an item on the ground and have a dragon breathe on it. It comes with 5 charges in case you mess up.
---
You dont use cat in Vanilla if you pvp
---
Plenty of guilds kill  CT and KT on private servers no idea what youre talking about.
---
Phase 4 there will be.
---
The PVE servers are significantly smaller then the PVP server, mixing the two isn't going to solve the problem, the horde will out number the alliance and they will get higher Q times, which will result in even fewer WPVP target for horde to kill while waiting on their timer.
---
#/MOOO!
---
Attunements feel like, to me, a less personal and more communal obligation than gearing. Attunements are to put you in the raid, where as gearing is just increasing your throughput.
---
Problem is that world PvP really isn't an option on most servers. Atleast not the PvP ones.
---
Horde can only put up a fight when they are 10+ levels above or 3v1
---
What do you mean there's millions of little gnomes hiding in every nook and cranny, why do they have to be gnomes &gt;:(
---
I stayed solo most of the time! I mostly picked people off one or two at a time in Kargath or Camp Mojache. I'm a gnome rogue on Fairbanks and here's my current spec https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305020105531051-3023-05023002
---
You dont use cat form in pvp in Vanilla. Druids kite and do dmg with their dots, atleast in 1v1s
---
I mean you either give out copper because you can't afford to be cool, or you give out gold because you can 👌
---
But to get summoned to the MC portal you still need to get to the brd entrance.
---
The poster above is actually Epstein on his secret Reddit account. Don't trust him if he offers you nudes.
---
I can't disclose my proof due to concerns for my safety and fear of being banned from the sub. Rest assured that my evidence is plentiful and genuine.
---
I research flare a bit for a private server awhile ago. From Vanilla evidence, sometimes the debuff dropped immediately, sometimes it'd dropped after 5 seconds or so.
---
It’s not worth it for an alliance group to defend the boats. Once you have killed the camping rogues a few times they aren’t worth any honor anymore so you move on.
---
I love tanking. Especially in raids. I really would love to ride on my Epic mount to tank in raids. THAT sounds like a party.
---
Looks pretty uncomfortable on the inner thighs.
---
Molten Core is easily puggable,
---
Free portals for newbs, doing gods work
---
It takes like 5 min. Have your hearth ready.
---
You’re already breaking rule 3. You’re legit contradicting what you said..
---
&gt;There's absolutely enough interested players to fill servers for retail, classic, tbc, wrath, and probably even cata and beyond.
---
I doubt that. Right now the hype is still going strong, but we'll see about that in 2 or 3 years.
---
Thanks. I have it on my warrior, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what SGC could possibly be.
---
Rarely, but I've only tested it with 2h. Maybe it's better with dualwielding.
---
I got 1 epic in classic so far, but its only worth a bit more than vendor price sadface
---
They said we wouldn't like vanilla. We still don't know if we'd like vanilla because this isn't it.
---
it works again
---
I don't think you should expect the players to think about long-term. The developers should.
---
According to this sub - yes, because rogues would finally be able to out-DPS warriors and it is, somehow, a Bad Thing.
---
Never played Elite Dangerous eh? Fuel Rats are gods
---
DM me the proof or its fake
---
There is actually a lot more to do in retail but I feel like the amount of choices that are direct progression are too many.
---
In classic there is 2 grinds, raids weekly or pvp.
---
In retail there is mythic+, 3 different raid difficulties, world content, pvp etc. All which can be used to progress gear because of WF and TF.
---
But in terms of retail being barebones...  it is not. There is an overwhelming amount of content, but that's just the problem, you can choose what to do but ultimately its structured content. Classic on the flip side has tons of player driven content, there isnt necessarily a lot to do but if you and your friends decide to head out to un'goro to gank you can. If you decide to head out to winter spring and farm mobs you can. There is tons of free time between raids which means less structured content and more player driven content. Which makes the game feel more self directed.
---
I feel this so hard, except I farm herbs like a madman while everyone is still snoozing off their gaming-hangovers. Now I want to start a guild that focuses on early birds.
---
Haha judging by the comments here it seems the Horde is a little butthurt
---
Ded svr
---
I stepped into DME with my lock today after watching a bunch of videos and could NOT get it to work. Any tips?
---
Yes it is and it's pre raid bis so you should do it. I think every class has a reason to do it.
---
Yep, my main characters have always been alliance... love just hitting the queue button and being ready to go right away. Just jump in any time I’m bored and want to kill some time. In fact I make a point of every MMO I play to be the least favoured faction, it’s always better for organised PvP.
---
Meanwhile horde friends queue up for hours to get in to a single BG and complain like it’s a problem they didn’t create themselves.
---
This subreddit is actual garbage.
---
Remember the talk about how great the community in classic would be? Clearly a pipe dream.
---
A large portion of the community is disappointing man. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of chill people but there is *way* more selfish loot-whore bad manner types than I anticipated. I don't get how people have fun just being a cunt and starting conflict over the most minor of disputes or something as small as 1 wipe.
---
I’m going to say Paladin. Takes a bit to level but Holy Paladins are some of the most sought after healers. In PvE they start good, bring great buffs, and end great.  In PvP their a walking mound of steel-clad heals that can absorb being jumped by tankers. If you ever decide that you want to smack a fool with a sword Retribution Paladins are below average in PvE but are menaces one PvP as a supporting DPS.

I remember one time people in his chat were complaining about him stopping to watch a video a donor asked him to watch
---
His response was something to the effect of:
---
"Look, I have to watch this. If I don't watch it then people won't be able to record me watching it and upload it to youtube and other people won't be able to clip that into highlight reels.  I'm responsible for a whole content creation ecosystem here!"
---
-100% interest
---
Better guards. Better quests (and more quests).

Dick on people in pvp with my epix

It's not just horde.  Alliance are doing it as well.  This is my experience on Yojamba this weekend as a level 51 Horde. I work full time and long hours so don’t get much chance to get on during the week. Thinking I might log in and see if I can get a couple of levels. I don’t have a heap of time so a ST run is out of the question.
---
Logged out at Camp M in Feralas in the inn last time. Log in. Run outside the inn. Sapped. Stun locked and dead. So barely got out of inn let alone the camp. I watch as the Rogue runs through the inn and disappears around the corner. He either dropped into the water behind the inn or stealthed around the corner. I corpse run back and rez and run down to the road just next to the flight path. Sapped, stun locked and dead. Different rogue. There’s multiple rogues camping the base. I’m not going to be able to get out of the camp so I log out.  This was at 8am Saturday.
---
Log back in a few hours later. Rogues appear to have gone. Being a druid, I stealth and make my way stealthed a distance out of the base and mount and head away to quest. 60 hunter and mage coming the other way – dismount and demolish me. I corpse run back. I stealth the rest of the way to my quest. I get the questing done comforted in the fact there are 2 or 3 other horde in the area. I head back to the road. Mage at the road killing a horde. I’m no chance of taking him down given hes a 60 but I try to help but die. Corpse run back. Make my way to the camp stealthed the whole way. Hand in quest and pick up next one.
---
Make my way to an area where the mob is. Find it, start killing. I am dotted up. Get the mob and the quest requirement but die as the dots take me down and the 60 lock stands by watching. Corpse run back. Make my way to a different area to continue the quest. Get another mob for the quest right next to Camp M but a lock is there and dots me up and I’m dead. I spirit rez next to the camp, drop down and log out.
---
Next day log in in the morning. Rogues there again, but there seems to be some horde protecting the area. I am able to get out to continue the quest from the previous day. Only have 1 mob to kill. Find it, kill it and head back. Outside the entrance to Camp M I am sapped, stun locked and die to a 60 rogue. I rez, run down, hand the quest in and run into the tent. Look to see where I’ve got to get some quests done. Tanaris. Damn. This is going to suck. I fly there anyway in the hope it might be better. Land. Dead. 2 mages camping the flight path. I spirit rez and try to run to the entrance. Die another time before I can make it in. Not going to be able to quest here. I hearth to UC as I need to do some stuff at Stonard.
---
Fly to Stonard. Land, turn to make my way to the inn, sapped and stun locked. Dead.
---
I log out. I’m not sure how anyone could possibly think this is fun. I’m either going to cancel my sub or reroll on PvE. I’d say the Druid has reached his max level.
---
Reported
---
Lose through failure to gain.
---
The answer is always 42.
---
When there aren't any bgs?
---
&gt;BGs will probably cross between PvE and PvP servers.
---
Only 20-25% of all servers are PvE.
---
As in make it easier? Karazhan was incredibly easy, no? I only started tbc 2.2 ish, was it hard on launch and nerfed later or something?
---
I'm glad OP included an overlay, don't think I'd get it otherwise.
---
Can't help it if the ratio is 33:66 ally to horde.
---
I'll wait like two weeks.
---
Yeah like why would we ever tell someone to *hide* a red flag that huge?
---
Cringing
---
And the people on my server don't let me play it
---
OKB o0Me r
---
Watched alliance use the zep from UC to Org. No issues for them.
---
Maybe. I'd assume the boss that spawns has a big impact. Having the bats come out that spam silence might be tricky.
---
The time of their lives lmao
---
I mean make it LVL 60 viable with naxx aq gear
---
Whatever makes you sleep at night. You guys are outnumbered/outplayed on PVP servers the factions are pretty much balanced on PVE/RPPVP/RP servers
---
You can miss the opportunity though.
---
Exactly
---
Polls please, because the TBC crowd seems to be the vocal minority.
---
WoTLK pserver population greatly outnumbers TBC.
---
For Horde it's a memorable encounter. For Alliance it's Tuesday.
---
TBC pserver population speaks for itself, so you're in fact the one in denial.
---
What's happening on December 10?
---
Upset?
---
In PvP servers sure. PvE servers favor alliance, and RPPvP servers are balanced.
---
u die in 1 second its like a budget destro lock that has heals instead of a pet
---
Indeed, but there are 2 other dps who would likely leave if they had to give an orb to another dps 
---
this is a gain 1 lose 2 scenario
---
This is true you are correct but I think OP meant he can’t summon himself to Orgrimmar when he’s not there or a dungeon he’s not standing in front of, compared to a Mage’s teleport
---
No blink no coc no cs no defenses.
---
You can do nova and fireblast thats pretty much it
---
Wut
---
So someone messed up real bad here?
---
For real, ally on here has this strange over the top victim complex lmao. Find a group. I play ally BTW. We do the same evil, mean, neckband things horde does.
---
thats not pvp thats retardation
---
i mean, youre splitting all that honor with the other 100 horde you bring with you, you coward lol
---
Pretty sure it’s the same for us rogues too
---
They should, to a point at least - if you gank everyone until you quit, noone is left to gank. Gank in moderation lol
---
okzoomr
---
I swear it used to be the opposite, the horde sound used to be for the alliance and vise versa.  To me, it's not negative or positive as much as a warhorn sounds like a "horde" noise and a trumpet more "alliance" like.
---
Look at those big tough horde 10v1ing people. They're probably so tough they go on reddit and blizz forums to tell the people they camp to roll pve. I bet before they camped brd they bagged a few real 1v1s....against some level 25s and 30s in southshore or stv for that confidence boost for the great and trying battle ahead.
---
Big bois indeed
---
Whats funny is the leathers dropped to 2g this week
---
Just like the Montreal canadiens
---
It matters in PvE why?
---
Not world first, but still worth a flex. Gz
---
Now I’m wondering if I’d be happy/intrigued for an arena remake in a hypothetical classic+.
---
I loved my days doing premade BGs in Vanilla, but didn’t mind arena either. The arena ranking/loot system seems like it’d be more favorable to my schedule now than the honor system. Also arena with classic gameplay would be kinda hilarious.
---
You get five charges. If you use the first one correctly you have four more to either just destroy or use somewhere humorously like in this pic.
---
It's interesting that you say this because whenever I've gone to Winterspring, WPL or EPL on Mograine I've always run into a tonne of Horde and died with barely any other Alliance to be seen.
---
This is why after P2 dropped as an alliance player on Herod I completely rerolled on a new server. Went onto Bloodsail Buccaneers and havent touched my lvl 40 warlock on Herod since. I dont want to have to wait in a 2 hour queue just to get steamrolled by roaming groups of 60's or Rogues camping everywhere, only to wipe on the way to SM a dozen times.
---
It seems to only happen after zoning from an instance, not any other time. The standard 5 seconds returns after the first time, even when I remove my stealth.
---
I would just use the archivist cape. It’s close enough. The hide will give you a slight boost but the gold cost is barely worth it unless you’re a min maxxing try hard in a hardcore guild. I cast a total of 100-130 heal spells throughout all 10 boss fights in MC since they die so quick. The extra 9 healing or whatever then translates to 900-1170 extra healing, oh but wait a lot of that is over healing. So over 10 boss fights the hide is worth maybe 80-90 healing per fight. Not really worth the ridiculous gold cost imo
---
Mp5 is going to be better for progression anyway if you’re just starting MC with a guild who hasn’t cleared much of it yet
---
Well you never know if you enjoy a quest til you've completed it right :p I'm not saying I don't enjoy questing, I plan on completing them all by some point in the future when I've got the time, I'm asking more for quests worth getting done earlier rather than sooner
---
Sounds like retail Alliance to me.
---
Glad to hear! Means ganking Alliance will still be part of the meta.
---
You should absolutely be demanding a cut of the thorium or crystals or demanding they pass on all vendor loot. You are literally getting used in that example
---
If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many is a video worth? :D
---
Edit:if not it
---
  This looks like the final scenario on killer instinct
---
Everyone seems to think that opening horde transfers is going to get the secers balanced. Most people are not going to transfer to a server to be ganked and be camped like they have been doing to other players for the last couple if weeks. In fairbanks I havent gotten a queue since honor dropped. That means there is no incentive to transfer off of a server when you are on the winning team. They need to come up with an incentive for people to play on the outnumbered side of each particular server. Just off the top of my head a leveling bonus for servers with a team imbalance. They need to give people a reason to jump onto the losing side not just hope that they will.
---

For the Horde, broseph.
---
Sounds like you dont have any friends
---
Very lucky
---
This post is going to stand the test of time.
---
Alliance cant PvP
---
Alliance side is populated. Horde got better with the recent transfers but they definitely need more. I wish Blizzard would address the imbalance. Especially since their latest solution (faction specific transfers) didn't do nearly enough. Their silence on the issue has me worried.
---
Username checks out
---
No mages though.  Must have been nice.
---
Haha he's watching... He looks like mike zakowski
---
u/Butt_Bandit ;)
---
No.  It doesn't.  Maybe on Pservers where the modified the rep gains.
---
Well its been 15 minutes since you posted this so its prolly like 4.6 by now
---
it's not so bad. A couple hours a day with music. I almost have enough gold where I wont have to do it again for months.
---
that would be true if ppl didnt roll on pvp realms at the beginning cuz blizz released like 3 servers for whole europe, also there are barely any transfers from pvp to pve, i think many ppl would use it and i would probably think about it too
---
can you expound please. this is what Alliance did back in 05 or whatever? is that what you mean? really curious. i was unaware this happened if it is true
---
i’d say 1g minimum, less is whack and more is more than necessary but nice. just in my experience at least. (this is if you are a level 60)
---
For anyone wondering why this doubly sucks, Paladins can't use staves.
---
Never felt the need to ask for a mage portal. I don’t visit Darnassus and Stormwind is a cheap alt tabbed flight away.
---
Yes I do.  You're not getting exalted in a day or even a week.
---
Because I am tired of posts like oMG hOrdE cAn oNlY dEatHbALl. Finding solo ally is impossible as much. Both factions are grouping up yet there will still be people crying about it and blaming opposite faction.
---
Are you in a permanent state of cringe?
---
Not even close, big grats though!
---
the horde only rolls in packs and dies horribly if ever caught solo (which is so rare)  
---
the alliance might afk in major cities but when BGs come out we will roll all over the horde with instant que times and yall are gonna be qq'ing all over reddit about it trying to say AV was tuned towards alliance or that blessing of freedom is unfair in WSG lol
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion ofcourse:) one of the great things about this game is that everyone can play it to each own preference. Peace
---
I don’t wear tank gear unless I’m tanking, don’t think I said I wear it for dps. All my plate gear in my dps set has hit and crit.
---
How can people get annoyed at you because you're sitting AFK on your epic mount right in front of the mailbox otherwise?
---
Sure.  Once you've done it, you can simply ask anytime you come back.  And it's part of the fun.
---
Cat form is faster damage but you take more incoming damage. Personally I find cat form to be preferable because the mobs die faster and I can just do some powershifting to heal myself in between. 
---
Bear form is easier to kill but takes longer to kill. I leveled with my bro who's on a hunter so I utilized bear form more when we were questing because I could pull 3-5 guys and we could kill them faster that way. But leveling solo I would say cat form is more efficient /faster
---
We dont allow hots on our tanks anymore now that DM is out. There are too many consumable/world buffs and they take up all 32 of the available slots before HOTs are factored in. I have a WA that blacklists all HOTs, as well as things like Salv and Spirit/Int buff.

Link to the blue post would be better than a rando OMG CONFIRMED it
---
30 with 30g+ is certainly possible, especially months after release. But 23 with 60g+? Yeah no.
---
they took all the good content off there, i cant go back
---
Agreed.  I think BGs might provide a short period of time where this won't be as prolific, but it will still happen and will continue given the number of people on each server.
---
Just tell your group about how you can click on the pile of bones during the encounter and it'll one shot a random ogre, it makes the whole thing easy.
---
That's not who/what I was replying to.
---
Blue post or its not confirmed.
---
 Burning Steppes was the first BG of classic, I can’t step foot there without running into roaming alliance death squads...
---
When I was a little shit in high school I found this place on my rogue, and a raid group standing at the entrance of the grove. I shot the dragon and sprinted into the group. The wipe was absolutely insane - people cursing, turning into mushrooms and emitting an AoE cloud that killed their buddies that almost made it out alive... 15 years later, I’m wondering if those players are still mad about it. I wish I screenshotted the hate I was getting.
---
I've been storing up twink items for my rogue when I get around to one, though he's way far down on my list, probably after I finish my current alt (warlock) whenever that happens.
---
Pally tank with double innervate. Spam greater blessings to your hearts desire and you'll never lose threat lol
---
Tell me how I can even lose honor points by not doing PvP? lol
---
Not locks and mages
---
i would rank a priest higher than a hunter just because they can do insane dmg with wand/dots + ridiculous amount of utility. but yea priest/hunter for 19s.

oh, i am not going that crazy, just dual wielding fiery weapons from 20 up as a fury warrior, MS spec is the normal leveling spec, but when you can dual wield and afford fiery enchants, it is definitely faster
---
For every Alliance deathball, there are 20 horde deathballs.
---
Ya but the fact that my guild has over 100 toons and after myself, the last time anyone logged in was 3 weeks ago tells me it's already losing its flair.
---
What do you mean?
---
Do ony attunement and hydraxian waterlord quests for douses.
---
Absolutely. Im warlock class officer for my guild. The rule right now is...if a rogue gets MCd and doesn't die, every warlock in the raid has to mail the guild bank 5g.
---
yeah they're the same people who think Ret should be able to top meters without realizing its one of  the best **support class** in the game
---
Because we were outnumbered in vanilla and had to “git gud” to deal with constantly being ganked everywhere by the alliance with a raw number adva..... oh..... wait...
---
Most the people who rolled Alliance who were around for vanilla were Horde, trying the other side out.
---
There is no The Horde in classic, only The Herd.
---
There isn't anything more skill full on the alliance, they are straight up the more powerful faction in BGs because paladins are crazy strong healers and support class. Add in just geographic advantages in AV, yea alliance are going to stomp because they are just heavily favored. 
---
But you know, fuck horde player am I right?
---
They don't despawn on ice block.
---
They do occasionally DESPAWN, but that has nothing to do with ice block.
---
Well, refusing to go by warrior bis - lists painted the picture in my head that way, since bringing an offtank set is very common and you would still follow a bis-list unless going for an odd plate-dps set, hence my comment
---
You have a typo. I think you meant final fantasy x
---
    /cast [button:1] Some Spell
---
SW:P hurts a hell of a lot more than people realize, I've found.
---
Idk it was inside the inn. He had 4 guards on him and 2 running then he ice blocked they all despawned and the 2 running in ran back out. Ice block wore off and he was fine walked outside and ganked someone else.
---
Lmao, that is exactly what a conspiracy theorist would say. What proof do you have aside from "it's like a month since last time!!!11!1!"
---
I use onebag add-on. At first I was thinking it's easier to organise my bags the other way around. But having one bag is a very big comfort!
---
&gt; blizzard does nothing
---
Oh so faction specific transfers is nothing? Or just not the something you wanted?
---
Cat form is always faster. Shift out heal and continue.  Do you have furor and wolfshead helm?
---
Bear form is helpful for tougher mobs.
---
wPvP will do that. I’m tempted to quit soon as well
---
It's called a macro
---
Whores work for money. Sluts do it for free... slut is the worst were looking for here. Portal slot. Water slut. Food slut. Mages are sluts.
---
Yea I had to do it 04.30 on a weekday lol. It's very soloable though
---
TBC feral gets maim and cyclone, allowing them to restealth somewhat reliably. You can spend a lot more time in either cat or caster safely. You don't get that in classic so you have to go bear or travel more often to deal with pressure.

I met him in Arkansas like a decade ago, but yeah sadly he's passed on to the great tiger habitat in the sky. He was a cool cat
---
It‘s simple and made for use. Those two spells at the bottom are irrittaing though.
---
Lol - just logged in to collect some AH sales and I was already dead.  So must have been ganked while I was logging out.  This is how shit it is at the moment.
---
TBC was mechanically superior in virtually every way. Classic mechanics are an unfinished mess.
---
As hilarious as this is, I still cringe at the thought of all those Dishonorable Kills.
---
my boomer was always high on the damage meters, not sure where this whole "moonkins can't dps" mentality comes from...
---
Granted, going into Naxx I was probably the most geared caster, but my healing gear was basically free, so eventually i just used my untouched DKP and snagged every piece of loot from BWL away from the mages and warlocks and declared I was now a Boomkin.
---
Regardless I was always near the top of the meters and the mages loved having me in their group.
---
I was also a very easy target for people to stack on during movement encounters.
---
I'm not sure I like how close your action buttons are to your character, but i like the simplicity
---
I think you are all delusional if you think Blizzard 2019 can be trusted to do a good Classic +.
---
TBC is tried and true. Well loved by a good portion of the community and already a marketed success. There is little investment required.
---
Classic+ would take all kinds of resources, coders, and manpower to create compared to how easy it would be just to slap TBC servers onto Classic.
---
Not only does 2019 Blizz suck too much to do a good Classic+, they are too money oriented to take such a big risk where TBC is guaranteed to work out well for probably a fraction of the cost of investment.
---
They are gonna lose players with Classic+ or TBC either way. Might as well go the cheaper easier more financially secure route.
---

---
Most tanks will split it with a healer and run it as a two. You don’t really need a mage at all so they don’t bring much to the table. You can’t do a jump run without a tank that gives them the leverage.
---
Thanks for sharing this, I also fully agree that the very negative stories I have to share, just the past week I helped a guildy complete several steps of his Onyxia attunement and mentioned in passing in I’m trying to level up my enchanting. 
---
A few days later I was in shock when my mailbox was filled with enchanting materials, much of exactly what I needed. What I gave him in terms of time investment , he tripled back in sheer value.
---
Yeah but r/classicwow is apparently the type of place that anyone that likes retail. 
---
I guess I’ll go play retail content while the sub continues to complain about getting ganked and their queue times
---

Raiding spec not pvp
---
You exactly described 90% of the Alliance players on our server.
---
Stop trying to get others to make the same mistake you did.
---
You must be like 12 years old.
---
"Classic+" is not even a thing. It's a label on an empty box that nerds project their fantasies into.
---
TBC is a finished, polished piece of software that exists in the real world.
---
Well, we don't need a charge when we are already in combat, so we can replace this button with anything else. Dunno how comfortable it would be for you, but you can test it though:
---
/cast [nocombat] Charge; Defensive Stance
---
Also, it's possible to switch back to Battle Stance when you get outta combat if you modify it a bit:
---
/cast [nocombat, stance:1] Charge; [nostance:3] Defensive Stance; [stance:3,nocombat] Battle Stance
---
It'supposed your Defensive Stance is 3rd on your bar.
---
Regarding your 2nd question I use Bartender for keybindings, if you don't want to change visuals of your action bars, there's an option to make them blizzlike.
---
It entirely depends on what weapons you have to choose from.
---
It's time vs payout. Mages can go farm gold hand over fist. It's not worth the time spent standing there for much less unless they're selling multiple ports a minute for let's say.. 50s. It's also a how much is your time worth. If spending 20 minutes of your time to go from kargath to thunderbluff isnt worth a gold to you that's fine. If you want to spend 10 minutes finding a mage that'll do it for cheaper, that's also fine. But if you want a port and you want it now, you're giving the mage leverage.
---
That’s very good. For I’m certain that if my alt was in the guild and they see it, it wouldn’t stop the avalanche of whispers to heal or tank something. I’m a druid btw and indeed maintain gear sets for both roles.
---
If it was like this till Wrath, then No Changes.

There's a couple points that are personal preference. But this gets the important ones.
---
He says he's suicidal and depressed, spending 16 hours a day playing a video game is the worst thing he could be doing in that state.
---
Oh yeah trust me, my first 60 was a warrior so I know how sloggish it can get between 25~40.
---
And although I had some stockpiled gold from my previous characters (29 hunter, 38 shammy) to take advantage of all the sub-1g BoEs that rained like water in the first month, I'd have killed for a good pair enchanted axes to make the auto attack era less tedious.
---
But mainly I'm just saving the few good greens and BoEs that I personally find.
---
I've had a feral harness, Zealot Blade, Butcher, a bunch of tiger and eluding rings/necks sitting in my bank for awhile now.
---
I think by the time I level a rogue I'll probably have enough spare gold sitting around to justify enchanting those two swords with crusader though, hmmm...
---
Fast and Furious part killed me haha
---
remember dude, the people who make the decisions to advertise shit like this are the pinnacle of capitalist society
---
ye, but zf you can turn off ur brain for, you have a safe spot, the dm east farming is more rewarding, but you actually have to focus,
---
Here's my general approach.
---
1) What stack size do people buy? (I'll often pay way over market price for the exact quantity I need, because selling the extras is too much annoyance.  Also, keep in mind people will often buy 1 item 3 times rather than buy a stack of 3, because singles show up first)
---
2) How does supply/demand/price change over the week?  (There may be an influx of the item, with dropping prices at the end of the weekend from everyone farming.  Then come tuesday, maybe demand spikes and prices go up because raids reset.  So, you buy @ sunday and sell @tues. You may want to watch for those patterns.)
---
3) What's the highest price __ will sell for quickly with 90%+ certainty? (people undercut so they dont have to repost, so buyout all the really low stuff and sell higher if you know the market better). 
---
4) What are people using __ for?  How is the market for both the upstream and downstream items trending?  (If the prices for an item drop, the crafting mats may drop soon too))
---
When I worked the AH in other xpacs, buying/selling items in a single day was a very small amount of profit overall.  I made 1mil+ making cross-xpac flips on things like vial of the sands mats though.  Buying out entire markets and artificially controlling their price is another tactic, but I highly suggest *against* that unless you're *really* experienced.
---
Starting out, my #1 and #3 points should make you a little consistent money.  Over time, you'll learn #2.  #4 will be easy for the items you personally use, but becomes really hard when you're dealing with hundreds of different items.
---
TSM is used by every high-end AH player i know on retail.  Set up a shopping list of primarily low-volume items where you know their market, and search the list for nice buys every time you hit the AH.  You can't buy/sell gametime on classic though, so I haven't tried much functionality here.
---
That's why I have the improved sap technique ;)!
---
As someone who uses item rack how do you even have that bar with all the trinkets? I cant find the option to enable it
---
It's a nice UI built around the center. It looks meh but it must be very good for focus and eye resting
---
It does not look aesthetically pleasing, no.
---
takes practice
---
Portals and water are quite nice for convenience; soloing ability is pretty high, but not quite hunter or warlock level.  
---
The biggest issue is a surplus of mages on many servers. Though not all! Some have a caster shortage and melee surplus.
---
Reading comprehension is bad my guy. Nobody said "you cant like PVE servers". If Blizzard ONLY has PVP servers then by default all players will be on a PVP server.
---
If no PVE servers means you dont play, that's not relevant to who is on what server.
---
So teabagging feels real?
---
You're supposed to organize instead of leaving.
---
Classic was never meant to succumb to the issues that retail has. THAT is why I am complaining. Retail is dying because of situations like this. You know what keeps players subbed? Sense of satisfaction, feeling like they're striving towards something. Not honor farm raid groups.
---
far from world first.. but still  VERY rare as fuck.. !
---
grats !
---
#SPENDIES IN
---
Are you sure they are cross-realm? I thought they were exclusive to your realm in classic
---
Also rouge's stealth is the equivalent to wearing a black shirt at night.
---
Honestly didn't expect that to be a blue quality item.  Hmm?
---
None of what you just said is correct.
---
Confirmed in testing, Blues yet to respond. 
---
This is an advanced warning so you don't end up in our situation. 
---
Poor coding on blizzards part. not accounting for the change between the new and old reset timers.
---
If it works for you, who cares.
---
You don't see the ones they remove, you only see the ones that get through.
---
You're wrong and you know it, that's why you stopped arguing.
---
Only pussies with pepperoni nipples wear tabards
---
We think he is posessed
---
Try gouging and getting some distance while energy ticks up
---
Ok. I'll try that out. Thank you.
---
Paladins, Escape artist, dwarf priests.
---
Yeah only horde is easy mode confirmed.
---
Currently have axe of deep woods in my and bone slicing hatchet oh. I also have earthshaker that I'll be using for pvp if I do go 2h spec.
---
Browse the AH and get some cheap Int gear. Shoulders, neck, rings, wands, etc., squeeze in as much as you can.
---
I mean its not like you have to be a boomkin to use faerie fire tho.
---
So you’re saying that server player cap being 5X has zero impact on the game? Fuck outta here. Idiot.
---
Looking badass!
---
What are you talking about? The FP exploit is completely broken. On reset day, I roamed anywhere from solo to 2-5 man premade of good players, no lifed 15 hours on a highly populated realm and ended the day for 23k honor. The guys in bracket 14 are currently pulling 40k honor a day minimum, and I see them at the thorium point flight path with a priest every day.
---
&gt; physically pulling
---
Lol. Just put a momentary hardware switch inline.
---
Imagine thinking that shamans and paladins are equal pvp healers...  
---
BoF, BoP, magic cleanse, the best defensive CD in the game, vastly higher sustain healing, what makes you think shamans are even close?
---
I have....not having a uncovered map bothers me.
---
You're wrong. Every single person on my server in the rank 14 bracket right now besides 1 or 2 rogues that sit in Iron Forge 18 hours a day are all FP exploiters pulling 40k honor a day.
---
pretty sure what's getting people to quit is not raising the population cap any higher to allow for 3k other players to be in game

Last time I checked, games are supposed to be enjoyable. Not everyone enjoys getting murdered over and over and just want to relax and quest and kill things.
---
(https://www.classicdb.ch/?quest=3628)[You Are Rakh'likh, Demon] is a long quest chain that takes you all over and finishes with an epic 5 man boss fight on a mountain in Blasted Lands. Rewards a 16 slot bag so it's worth doing imo.
---
Exactly. I have a lvl 28 warlock and there were 10+ hordes on lakeshire last night. 
---
I wanted to see how long they were willing to stay and corpse camp, and I had some time, and they were there for at least an hour.
---
Literally, I rez, I get killed, repeat 20 times, same place, same group of lvl 60 hordes.
---
The fun part is when you notice this is a screenshot taken on a phone of a photo he took of his computer screen lol
---
I'm almost revered with furbolgs as alliance on rattlegore.
---
Its a fucking nightmare. I only guild about 50 today over the course of 3 hours due to gank squads roaming. I'm probably not going to login until after the 10th or until they open paid realm transfers. Can't deal with the constant PVP.
---
Prior to honor being available it honestly wasn't that bad. Shit just changed things.
---
I’m on a fairly even split server, Still run into death squads all the time. It just doesn’t bother me. I knew it would be like this, maybe not as bad as it is, but I knew what to expect and I openly signed up for it. I guess the thing that motivates me is that I add them all to a KoS list and being that I play a rogue, I will get my revenge eventually.
---
some honor is better than no honor. 
---
and even if no honor, keep killing it in hope's it might give you honor
---
I need to reload mine soon. I'll get naked before crafting it lol.
---
That would make it a fair fight tho
---
I think warlocks lost the ability to do it with linked aggro patch.
---
1. Despite being the outnumbered faction my server has great PvE and PvP players aswell as group finding possibilities
---
2. Whenever BGs are out, instant BG queues (hopefully)
---
3. I found a great guild I like 
---
4. I've got ~10 IRL friends playing on my server
---
yeah and being able to spam it as a boomkin to get it applied is infinitely easier than having it get resisted 3x in feral and losing 18s of FF uptime.
---
It’s just a shame you’re horde. Much cooler as alliance.
---
&gt;probably rouge....
---
Magenta stacks up well against them I think...
---
Same thing happens on certain stairs around the world. For example, the first stair from the top in the crypt in SW wpl
---
It’s not just an aura though. It’s an aura attached to 12th place dps which isn’t 0
---
Is this US only?
---
Totem twisting with improved windfury totem
---
Lol, they are downranked.
---
That is one hot belly button tease!
---
Just having fun.
---
You get something out of picking boxes inherently - skill ups you can use for your own use (boxes, Gates, etc..).
---
I get absolutely nothing out of doing ports at cost. I just lose time. I don’t need to skill it up.
---
I don’t really care. I do em for free all the time. But yeah, it’s different. If people want to charge, their prerogative and 1g seems fine. But I’d rather just do them at cost with the understanding I’m not spending more than 5 seconds dealing with it.
---
No difference
---
What the fuck is an Enchantment Shaman?
---
Weekly decay, go read more about honor system
---
Those middle slots will filled in with time. Good idea with the fade.. I made this post for suggestions like that :) Ty.
---
IIRC those shared cooldowns.
---
Being in a guild with a lot of lvl 60s helps, as we can go around the world and reasonably hold off Horde. We get some nice 10v10 fights pretty often and it's fun.
---
Doing anything solo is a struggle.
---
Doing anything on my lvl 50 alt is doubly so. All the lvl 45+ areas are constant battlefields and I have no chance against lvl 60 players who rarely hunt alone. I've done Zul'Farrak probably 10 times already and I think that's below average for Alliance players on my realm.
---
I didn't expect it to be this bad, honestly. If I make the mistake of flying to Gadgetzan I'll get instantly killed when I land, and there are at least 20 Horde players killing any Alliance players they see inside the town.
---
No inn in the game is safe. Guards don't matter at all. Living flight masters are a rare sight. I haven't even thought about travelling to Searing Gorge.
---
You either get 40v1'd or do 40v40s that just sapper spamming and mage aoe this phase is complete shit literally all the top ranks on the servers are rogues are POMpyro mages suiciding for 1 kill in the cities
---
Drama?
---
Thanks. My logic is that it allows me to focus on my action bars while watching out for boss mechanics,
---
 ie DON'T stand here/DO stand here.
---
Interestingly on Herod I've  seen 4 seperate paladins with Sulfuras, but I've not seen any other class with one. I'm sure there's been a Horde with Sulfuras around in Org, but none that I've noticed personally
---
full cloth gear i imagine?
---
Traitor.
---
Look at Rextroy's videos on it
---
So let's get this straight. You and I pay for the same $15 a month. But because of race I should be punished?
---
My server is pretty heavily Horde dominated and all of the players with the most honor are on Alliance.
---
&gt;While I don't doubt you are getting ganked on sight on Yojamba and leveling now would certainly be harder than before phase 2. However, if you are having that much trouble on horde you really are doing it wrong.  Horde frequently control entire zones where Alliance die as soon they land at the FP. I'd suggest you go level in one of those zones: searing gorge, burning steeps, plague lands, etc . Your worst case experience, getting ganked semi-regularly in an underpopulated zone, is the best case experience for Alliance :(
---
Benediction has been a blast.
---
I was leveling an alt, saw someone run by wearing this, then I immediately went "OH SHOOT I FORGOT ABOUT MY HEIRLOOMS" then I remembered what game I was playing
---
If you can take the time to set up Elvui is great
---
 [https://youtu.be/4YBIivTJEdQ](https://youtu.be/4YBIivTJEdQ)
---
Pretty sure 3:1 player pops &gt; paladins lol.
---
Great job! What sort of DPS parses are you doing with it in MC
---
I did this unintentionally. That is, I did a starter account to lvl to 20 to get a reward in heroes of the storm. Then, when I subbed for classic I couldnt speak, but got blue bar exp all the way to level 15. Then, I logged off and my account was converted to a normal one by the morning. All blue exp was nice for the night it lasted though:)
---
&gt;It's not like blizzard has had to Nerf horde racials multiple times because they are too strong in PvP or anything
---
For a long time in WoW humans had one of the best racials, every man for himself. Blizz eventually nerfed that too, after years of people complaining.
---
&gt;and shamans have just as much utility as paladins
---
That's simply not true. Alliance will definitely have the advantage in bgs because holy palas &gt; resto shamans. Palas have good buffs without needing to be near totems, they have better survivability than shammies, and blessing of freedom helps warriors massacre ppl. Paladins are the best support class in the game. In late game it'll become even more obvious how strong palas are in organized pvp.
---
Pug bgs can go either way because half the palas will be memeing as ret, but well-organized premades will be alliance favored. If you want to see this in action, APES (alliance pserver guild) will probably stream their bgs. Horde premades of equal skill will have a hard time vs them because of paladins, you'll see.
---
I was upset for a bit until about 7 of my friends went out and sometimes we won sometimes we lost. But it really felt like world of WARcraft
---
You ever read the loading screen tips? "All things in moderation, including World of Warcraft".
---
Not really, it's a meme weapon and mostly just used for PvP/meme specs.
---
&gt; forced
---
Nobody made you roll on a PVP server.
---
I about shit myself for a second when I saw an 800g repair bill on retail.
---
Not if you're a tauren. Cant ride any mount but kodo/wolf I believe
---
In raids there will generally be one rogue assigned imp EA if your raid is min-maxing debuff slots.
---
It took millions of play hours to find this, exactly how the fuck are you mad they missed it in QA?
---
I think in today’s terms this is very accurate. These dungeons were sooooo heavily farmed and any hard or medium core player who hit 60 in the first month either farmed and got their item, or got it in the next month after release when they were still super easy to get groups. So you might see a lot of hojs or savage glad chains, but you never know the odyssey that player might have endured or not endured to get it. I was jaw dropped my rogue friend got a hoj in 3 runs. I kept telling him dude you have noooo idea how insane that shit is. He didn’t quite believe it. His hardest item was maybe truestrike shoulders, which still he got in maybe 20 runs. It’s all relative really to how much time you have to dedicate and how efficient that time is spent. 5 continuous hours can yield a shit load of runs, where 5 hours spent forming 5 different groups is less than ideal, and maybe has competition for rolls
---
Wow. I was wondering why my sheet is messed up. I moved to Singapore this summer so my HKs are almost exclusively during this time because it's 7 PM to 11 PM my time. Grinded about 600 HKs that were all in a group of 2. Sad day.
---
It's to make money off the people that check the auction house instead of using an item database.
---
With 5/5 in the reckoning talent you get an extra attack whenever you get crit. This effect can stack up to 4 times if you are getting crit without attacking anything and will be triggered whenever you attack next. People on private servers use sit macros while getting attacked to gain stacks (because you always get crit while sitting down), but in classic, reckoning doesn’t register while sitting down. You have to abuse spell batching to stack it because it will only register when you are “standing” so you have to sit down then stand up right as the mob is about to swing.You can use the addon Luna unit frames to track how many stacks you have if you wanna reck-bomb people
---
If you were surprised by any of this, you weren't there for the first honor system roll-out.
---
Jesus Christ it’s amazing g how people don’t understand how qa works or what’s a reasonable scope to expect
---
What server you on jerzey?
---
AQ events crashed servers multiple times and that was back when the realms held a small % of the players compared to now, i know the hardware is better but theres still some lag in large pvp zones and thats even with only a few hundred on each side, the rest of the server population is spread out leveling or in dungeons/raids  
---
AQ event where anyone who can get to sithilius (and by then even newer players, or people with limited playtime will have a 60)  is gunna come out just to witness it... lmao
---
Yeah that's what I was wondering about. Its hard to aoe when you're chain silenced
---
Every Rogue I've fought 1v1 has popped every single cooldown they have, usually twice to kill me.  Its supper goddamn annoying to the point where I'm saving up for an invuln mail.
---
Casters really aren't a problem, and druids just need to get them to about 60% health then if you have EleM just nuke them from orbit as Night Elf Druids have virtually no way to stop you in time.
---
It will be extremely useful in WSG and Av in a couple of weeks though.
---
&gt; honorable 1v1
---
Future Saurfang told us there is no honor.
---
I tried this out and like it too, but do you know if there is a way to display the main tanks and their target, like in the default raid frames?
---
I'm here! #13 reporting in.
---
do it :D
---
Potting in MC lol
---
Is there a macro to use flash heal followed up by a renew?
---
SL warlocks with the T1 life drain bonus are such a cancer class spec.  Thankfull they are virtually useless outside 1v1's which 99% of pvp is small group fights.
---
what are those?
---
Small indie company
---
Look up Holderhek on YouTube, in MC the damage he’s doing is like right between the casters and the melee. If you’re willing to farm the consumes shamans do fine damage. Plus despite what everyone else is saying having nightfall is better on an off tank than an enhance shaman anyways.
---
&gt; Most
---
Not from my experience, at least Horde side.
---
shamans still have the ability to contribute highly in PvP, and the racials that horde have are better than alliance, horde will claim that the game is tuned against them when BGs come out, sure, but its just a way to compensate for their shit play after only PvPing with a 10 to 1 advantage in open world.
---
&gt;getting stomped in BGs
---
Guess you're new around here. Only BG that Alliance wins often is AV. You're our bitch in WSG.
---
Yes, look up the spell and look at the link  [https://classic.wowhead.com/***spell=18431***/bellowing-roar](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18431/bellowing-roar) it gives you the correct id.
---
Dual spec is the only acceptable QoL
---
I feel like this should be something every developer thats experienced should consider when they're rewriting this kind of software though. Like wtf? It's legit missing a fourth of the day which happens when dealing with resets.      
---
I don't see how it can be justifiable to test only the "happy path", because else it should've been considered or tested unless they're that strapped for resources
---
I'm positive that the holy effect from righteousness counts as an extra melee attack. It procs Thrash Blade
---
Is this every day or just Tuesday mornings?
---
Ya... Totally a meme. So, I'll go ahead and take the drop from Rag, ty.
---
Giggety

there are

Eh, I use shadow wrath because I like to see my name towards the top of the meter but I'm not dropping 5+g for a superior fire res pot. I'm too broke trying to control shitty markets
---
What server?
---
Retail is dying because of poor and stale game design. "Situations like this" are total none issue because of WM. I stopped arguing because you don't have anything interesting to say. You go ahead and tell yourself whatever you like. Please continue to cry about pvp on pvp servers. That meme, unlike retail, never gets stale.
---
Weeps in lvl 54.
---
Hit 48 the day honor came out.
---
Server went from 50:50 to 70:30 in the process.
---
I’m getting close to being able to have a shot against non-geared out 60’s though. Came within a few hits of killing a few of the 60’s that jumped me today.
---
All i see is a wasted raid slot lol. But for real grats on the hand, ive always liked how it looked.
---
BIG TITS AND PEP NIPS
---
Yeah that's bummer. We're all hoping Battlegrounds will fix that. But hope you find a good server in the end.
---
He has way longer then 2-3 years left. While it is hard to predict exactly where streaming will be in ten years time, he will be able to survive off the core following he has. Look at some of the OG youtubers still going after 10+ years.
---
It helps that he is a massive tightass too
---
It's funny because of how horde was less popular in Vinilla but people have come to love orcs more than they like Elf and Humans
---
Can confirm.  Am horde on Sulfuras.  Am also bad.
---
Genuinely not. I'm having the time of my life.
---
lmao, stay mad
---
Adobe Caslon.
---
Cat if you’re questing.
---
Bear if you’re leveling in dungeons.
---
Bears such as the American Black Bear and the Grizzly Bear hibernate in the winter. Their heart rates drop from a normal 55 to only 9!
---
Oh then that’s very cool. I forgot how that worked in vanilla. Fuckin Tauren on this bad boy would be crazy.
---
I did predict Vendorstrike was dropping and the next week called out the number our lootmaster was going to roll for the Ony Bag 
---
But calling out a random purple from thrash is quite impressive
---
Cool ableist joke dude. So funny.
---
Good question - I don't have my machine in sleep mode and it works but should be easy enough to test this.
---
Yeah and those independant websites claim alliance are overpopulated on my server.
---
My pvp experience of camping alliance 80-90% of the time suggests those websites have some serious sample bias.
---
It is. But when you already outnumber the other side 3:1, just don’t act like it’s becuse you’re actually good at fighting and it’s not obmoxious to deal with.
---
You can use a skill as long a sit isn't detrimental to the group. And that skill is VERY inefficient, given the mana costs versus damage done. And I don't want to burn my mana healing your dumb ass instead of the tank, who is the most efficient damage sponge in the group. And when shit goes down, I need to have mana to heal the whole group, not sitting there OOM because I blew it all healing you.
---
And in the end, *I* decide how I use my skills, which is exactly the principle you're trying to claim. But now you're telling me what I have to do (heal you), breaking *your own principle*.
---
TL;DR There are much better ways that you can do damage. Do that instead of trying to bully your healer to get on board with a strategy that will end in a wipe, if someone pulls an extra mob and *that mana that was just all used on you* is needed for other members if the group.
---
Actually tho, all these salty nelfs that don’t understand pvp
---
Huh? Go to sleep Boomer.
---
I'm playing new classes on the pve server pagle. I'm happy that I can encounter other players leveling and making dungeon groups. I'm just sad that I don't have the time/drive to level the same classes  a second time.
---
I pity the people that spent endless amounts of hours farming something, and then on their first raid managed to snag something that's a direct upgrade and trashes their previous piece.
---
You sound upset. Are you upset that companies care more about money than your feelings? Poor you :(
---
Why is how someone else wants to play and enjoy the game important to you?
---
Having actually worked in qa, I've lost count of the times I've had to explain how it works from my experience and generally most companies
---
I would like just fresh releases of classic every 2 years
---
You're only level 40 after the game has been out for 3 months. Herod is overwhelmingly populated by the most hardcore pserver players. This server was never gonna work for you from the beginning.
---
What part of "got too boring" implies that they're enjoying the game?
---
Sulfuras is a great server, when I saw census it was top 3 servers for most balanced. Plenty of guilds to join on both factions and constantly  High/Full. You may get ques on the weekend but if you do they will likely be less than 30 min. I think people complaining about horde are just upset they are getting camped by alli.
---
I would like to share all the technical details and wow logs but I am terrible at explaining things.
---
I asked my boyfriend who is the mage I mentioned earlier to explain everything in a reply to you. 
---
If I was to say it in my words:
---
I do! I am fully spec in protection. It goes great. I tank the three hardest hitting bosses and have 414 defense. No one can take agro from me because I use RF + GBoK on my lovely warriors dpsing around me. I also have a flat 300 fire resistance that goes up to 370 with trinkets in use. 
---
I am one of four tanks in my raid and the only pally tank. My fellow warrior tanks like and respect me. 
---
It is also my first time playing wow, I picked a pally tank and it’s all I know. In my heart I am a tank and I take the hits for my party. 
---
I joke to my fellow tanks that if they were Superman I would be Batman. I have a lot of utility. 
---
I am really grateful to my guild Dummy Thicc in Bigglesworth for taking me in and believing in me.
---
They will take any weird spec and encourage people to have fun. Which I think is the perfect guild for me.
---
Man... there’s just a lot of classes that are going to stomp paladins into the ground in a 1v1. Paladins are best in groups.
---
Looks like leveling at ridiculous hours of the morning is back on the menu boys!
---
Thats sick aswell, got proof? 😂 Funny part about is the Randomness, and its the 1st time he ever done it in 10 weeks of raiding. Really creepy wow gods.
---
IB
---
JUsT GeT JeD TriNkET
---
Considering they literally specified PvE..?
---
Ahem:
---
Please go back to retail you trash. Learn to play and quit whining. You signed up for this. If you want to look cool then stop playing. You're gonna ruin classic WoW. You clearly don't understand the genius of Blizzard when they crafted vanilla WoW. If certain gear didn't look like shit the game would be terrible. Transmog ruined WoW.
---
This has been your dose of /r/classicwow toxicity
---
Everyone is replaceable.. you need good dps as much as you need good tanks/heals!
---
Haven’t done an MC yet I just got it today but we will see
---
One of my raid mates usually stream our raids, I'll try to clip the Ony one tomorrow
---
At this rate it does not look like blizzard has a future
---
Not upset at all. Just pointing out simple facts. Also, it's very typical that you resort to calling someone upset rather than arguing anything to do with the point, because you can't.

Why would you even play wow classic if it's for someone else to level your char?
---
Zu g zug
---
How fucking smooth does your brain have to be to claim that the most dumbed down, casualized MMO on the market has a 'brutal' leveling experience?
---
It sounds like you called me the 'best bot'. That's awesome!
---
Level 60 Rogue, Alliance on Mograine EU. Ratio feels at about 60-40, which some say is OK, but actually isn't -- that's 50% more Horde than Alliance. A huge difference.
---
Getting into BRM is a pain in the ass. Being a stealth class helps a lot. But even then there's too many choke points when getting into that dungeon, so I often get spotted. Sometimes allies will take back the area, but usually they CBA to do it. I often see 20+ people ghost running into the dungeon and solo corpse hopping instead of grouping up and wiping Horde (not always possible, depending on their presence). So what I am more annoyed about is the overal mentality of an average Alliance player, who won't fight back.
---
On the other hand, these Hordies aren't particularly smart, since they are getting miniscule amounts of honor being split over so many players and getting diminishing returns from killing the same player over and over.
---
What keeps me playing, are my guildmates, and the small hunting parties we organize. We might not be the best players at the game, but we seem to be quite a bit more effective than the Hordies we meet -- whenever I mouse over my opponents my AddOn often shows me I have more victories over them, than they have over me. And I'm quite shit at PvP. What they have is sheer numbers.
---
I do however pity those of us who haven't had the time to get from 50 to 60 before all this had started. Hopefully it will get a bit more peaceful for them, when BG's get released.
---
I guess rolling on the highest possible pop server was a very dumb idea, and I should have just chosen a medium pop server...
---
Blizzard definitelly fucked up and should have had more servers ready, while manipulating faction growth to make them as close to 50/50 as possible. Especially since they could have predicted this happening quite easily, haveing examples from pservers and years of experience on their side.
---
I think blizzard can get it right this time around, but if we dont let them try whats the worst that happens. Going down the same old road that ends up at the same old place is really dreadful to think about for this games future.
---
XP wise it’s 44. 
---
/played it will vary depending on how you level.
---
If I was your friend and you took me to heartseeker I would resent you heavily. Just wait until BGs come out.
---
Go for it. You wanna spend all that gold on a meme you do you.
---
Arcane shot rank 1 is low mana and all you need to keep it in combat, while aspect of the cheetah is on
---
Caster dps reward is donk and the tank piece is quite mediocre.  It's insane for physical dps and healers though.
---
What? That's one of the best looking combos in game.
---
I am a level 45 undead priest. The peak of the game for me so far was the Scarlet Monastery levels, I met so many cool people and had so much fun! I kinda hot a wall after that where leveling is slow and really hard.  Some of my friends dropped the game too, so every day is a struggle. Dungeons are amazing all around, the pacing and thematics are spot on. Can't wait to see some of the later ones, everyone says they're even cooler.

I don’t see your point.  I’m not playing right now.
---
pve servers doesnt dont let ppl gank u like that tho
---
Is it absolutely necessary to be specd into improved FD? Basically can you do it with the 2/31/17 raiding spec?
---
Dwarves huh?

---
how much do you sell a TP ?
---
Awful, honestly. I never played vanilla and barely touched retail, and based on everyone's stories of vanilla I was expecting a really lengthy, rich leveling experience with tons of other players, interesting interactions in zones, and a really tight-knit, helpful guild to work on challenges and professions with.
---
In reality, I've been leveling alone for two months, quit twice, and can't find anyone to play with.
---
Honest question: why not? 80 DPS with 3.7 attack speed and 374 damage top end with a good proc and a built in ret aura. Why wouldn't it be good for pvp?
---
Alliance racials aren't terrible, stoneform dropping mortal strike for example is stupid good for any healer comp. but they are mostly just not comparable to horde since none of them can remove CC like wotf.
---
But I will say, arena servers definitely did not have even faction balance. I remember smolderforge asking you to please consider rolling alliance when you made a new character and most players being horde.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Zugzug
---
Well you better name some advantage that shaman healers have over paladins in pvp, because I'm drawing straws. Static, low range totems instead of player targeted buffs, objectively worse cleanse, less survivability, etc. Claiming they're equal pvp healers is laughable.
---
Hit 48 the day honor came out. Tip: Irontree Cave in fellwood. Bottom level only, good do, squishy mobs, drop herbs, silver and living essence.
---
Since they nerfed spy it doesn’t detect you from outside anymore.
---
Ive seen more warriors then shamans with it on Fairbanks
---
The armour ignore proc from BRE is much more powerful.
---
I am in the exact same situation. I only played in that window last week and didn’t get any rank at all
---
Love that tasteful amount of midriff.
---
Deathwing saw this and caused the Cataclysm.
---
I’m very thankful that my boyfriend suggested I join a PVE server as a first time player (no vanilla or retail), I will be hitting 3 months soon and it has been amazing! Exploring the world, getting to know others, learning about the history and lore, chatting and RPing with other players has been more incredible than I ever imagined. 
---
I wasn’t necessarily hyped up for this game as I had no idea what to expect and I’ve never played anything remotely similar to this type of game. But any expectations I had were blown out of the park. I’m really thankful for being introduced to this game and the people and look forward to many many more days being spent in this awesome environment!
---
I would love to see what gear your unrelenting laziness has produced when you think a 10 minute trip to farm a dungeon for hours is too much.
---
&gt;In reality, I've been leveling alone for two months, quit twice, can't find anyone to play with, and don't feel there's much to look forward to at the end.
---
Where you an alliance player on a pvp server? I had the same experience. I didn't see many alliance players in a leveling zone until I went to a pve server.
---
LOL
---
Piercing howl, imp hamstring, destealth rogues with booming voice, 30% crit with Axes so you can actually burst a target down, sweeping strikes can be useful in a crowd. 
---
Arms is just straight up better than Fury in every way. No good premade is going to let you roll as a fury warrior.
---
I can see that. I'd agree BRE is probably better.
---
They will reintroduce layers for AQ gate event and it'll be fine
---
Everything I’ve heard and seen on Benediction suggests it’s disorganized as hell on the alliance side.
---
i also think about leaving from flamelash, hope most of alliance will follow
---
Both
---
Grats man almost got half the mats just biding my time until the eye drops :D
---
BGs weren’t cross realm. Wait time will be minimal.
---
Its server time
---
How to do you make grid show a mana bar?
---
Thank you, I do understand that.  I was hoping they'd have paid enough attention to detail to provide the façade.  Like in reatil where you can fly over the entrances of AQ or ZF into the open space of the dungeon, even if there are no mobs.
---
Eh, its true to an extent. Sure if I can pop someone or find a 1v1 its good. Once they inevitably bring in 4 other people they get horrible honor but I get nothing except a black and white screen.
---
Mae sure you add onto the bug reports. Its a serious issue that will also affect battlegrounds
---
AOE Farming stratholme packs solo is probably the best gold farm in the game. If you group up multiple packs behind a corner...
---
However, the gear requirements are very stringent. I've tried it and by my estimations, if your mage was in full molten core purples you might just be able to pull it off.
---
Yeah I looked at your post history and laughed my ass off that someone can't compare a mage blade to a staff of dominance and instantly realized I was dealing with a dolt.
---
Coming from a hunter, nope. Deadzone.
---
It seems I triggered you. What's wrong?
---
When leveling alone, bear form is also better at 3 or more mobs of roughly the same level as you in my experience. 
---
When you are the only target mobs tend to deplete your health quite rapidly so you spend a lot of time shifting to heal as cat.
---
Just use bear form, apply fairie fire generously and swipe to your heart's desire. Bonus points if you're around level 45 and using [Mark of the Chosen](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17774/mark-of-the-chosen) and proccing it constantly.
---
Is it not possible to swap trinkets on combat? 
---
I see recommendations for all of these PVP trinkets, and I'm just wondering how people manage their usage. I guess I just assumed that you'd be able to hotswap them like weapon sets, but this doesn't seem to be the case?
---
 No fat dwarfes :)
---
Sounds great but I have trouble savoring it while I instant die 12 times on the way to any blackrock instance.
---
Was going to mention if fighting multiple targets bear is easier
---
No, it's not guaranteed. The chance of each single enemy in that pull getting frozen is 1-(0.85^5)= 55.6%
---
So the chance of ALL enemies in such a pull being frozen is (1-(0.85^5))^n, where n is the number of enemies in the pull. So the chance of a 2-pack both being frozen is 30.9%, 3-pack is 17.2%, and a 4-pack is 9.6%.
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
The problem is : I want to do everything every time it get asked. However I have now understood that it does not exist the op hybrid class. Most hybrid class let you have the possibility to roll also other roles but in the endgame you basically are a league behind the master role class.
---
I think anyway, as some of you said in other comments, that my problem resemble IRL. I am like this also in irl and I tend to change often.
---
Maybe if I fix my behavior in wow I will fix also my life lol
---
That's what I thought with the original thousand needles
---
Wholesome, i love this.
---
There will still be big pvp going on at world bosses for a looooooong time, so I at least will be very happy when wpvp outside of world bosses dies down somewhat, there's enough of it happening like twice or more a week in Azshara/Blasted Lands.
---
Still laughing pve server
---
Dial a port on p99 (everquest classic server)
---
That's pretty much it.  I move my points out of shapeshift cost to the imp Nature's Grasp though.  I have found in the current state ensuring the grasp goes off is more valuable to me.   But each person may feel differently.
---
Not really, sometimes onyxia aggro is off, or you have an unexpected spike in damage. Having the ability to take a few hits giving healers time to adjust can prevent a wipe.
---
Zero.. it takes a few hrs tops
---
It's likely only affecting certain people (or nobody at all since nobody has posted any screenshots to show exactly what's happening).
---
The fuck? This is game changing, thank you
---
Rattlegore best server! Always feels balanced.
---
Grats on being one of those people who makes the run slower for everyone over a potion.
---
The point is that I always feel the rush for something.
---
With the warrior I felt the rush to tank a Dungeon. I did that I liked that, but I have also understood that I was like full focus on that hour of Dungeon run. I was that focused that I had eye strain after the Dungeon run lol.
---
I changed to paladin with the idea of being a healer in Dungeon. Done that, likes that even more of tanking, however I hated paladin and it's fighting and healing style.
---
Created a priest and discovered that I really like armor from leather to plate. Also the thigg that let me go back to warrior was the fact that I was not able to find a group easily as a priest (strange at it seems but alliance in that server in low levels looks low populated)
---
Please explain one more time how it works for us ignorant people
---
My experience is like this: They cut the QA department to the point that QA can't do a proper review so they really only have time to deal with the severe, product breaking issues.  Then management explains that smaller bugs can be cause and fixed after it is in the hands of a client.  
---
Because that's a business decision, not a QA limitation.  Or is your argument that you couldn't do a better job if the company gave you more resources in the form of quality people getting paid well.
---
&gt; 5 blizzard will have a very high chance to freeze the entire pack ?
---
It would still only be 15% chance per mob getting chilled. It that 15% does not stack with the number of mages applying the chill. it would roll to see if it got frozen for each chill at and if it got more than 15 it wouldn't get frozen. On top of that each mob would be getting damage breaking chances the moment they get frozen because of the amount of blizzards doing damage. On top of that you even if you do freeze a few it is extremely likely not the whole group will get it which will result in the pack getting split.
---
Those whispers at the end are what got me.
---
BLAUMEUX - JOIN THIS
---
So you rolled on a pvp server and the faction youre at war with is killing you?  Good read 10/10
---
It is missing in my list together with mage and hunter.
---
Hunter and warlock are missing because I dislike pet management.
---
Mage because I really would like to play a non cloth user.
---
However who knows...
---
They’re bugged. An already cleansed tuber has a 25m respawn for it to be clickable again. You can get a corrupted one to spawn on top of a cleansed one, and cleansing that corrupted one will only make the corrupted node disappear. You’ll still have to wait for the timer to come up to pick the cleansed one. I’ve seen cleansed+corrupted nodes up at the same time on the same spot a few times now.
---
&gt;but I've not seen any other class with one
---
Because the only other classes that can use it are warriors (who are much better with Bonereaver's edge) and druids (for whom Sulphuras is pretty much useless).  Paladins and shamans are the only classes for whom Sulfuras is actually good enough to bother.
---
Alliance have a kinda similar thing with the mechanostriders. They can only be ridden by gnomes and dwarves.
---
Because it doesn't matter if you're on a main or an alt, you'll still get ganked mercilessly.
---
Oh do go on
---
I've been paying 1-3g per run for lower level dungeons.
---
As the meme boomkin who still gets loot? I love it. 
---
No one else wants Sulferas so I am first in line for that too!
---
Orc warrior fury prebis (minus HoJ and Savage gladiator chain)
---
I just got obsidian sword and was wondering if it would be better to pve dps with 2h than DW.   If it is, what talents should I have? Some people say slam is a must some say its not worth it.
---
I was thinking about waiting until I have HoJ until I respec but I was playing around in dungeons and noticed a significant increase in my does when using the 2h instead of DW.
---
I'm currently using axe of deep woods and bone slicing hatchet.
---
Eh, it's in pockets.  What you are describing is there, sure.  But there's also plenty of super chill people.  I killed Rag as an Arms Warrior, so there are definitely guilds that aren't elitist as well.
---
Lol Stalagg?
---
&gt; Rewards a 16 slot bag so it's worth doing imo.
---
I mean, the time you spend doing that quest, you could farm enough gold for at least 3 Traveler's Backpacks.
---
You mean hunting lvl 30 alliance alts of other horde players around the world? Alliance is already quitting the game.
---
&gt; some of those may be BiS for rogues or dps warriors, but are they really worth denying a hunter a potential ~15% dps upgrade?
---
Striker’s Mark is BiS until KT xbow for melees, and a downgrade for hunters using the dungeon crossbows. If you haven’t figured that out already, you’re in for way more loot issues later on.
---
Pretty sure they have. Never  Pve to PvP
---
Some people like fair fights on PVP servers. Weird, huh?
---
And what percentage of the time do you actually have the 2100 armor ignore?
---
It's going well. In the mid 50's now, just joined a guild, and looking forward to seeing what the endgame is all about. I really appreciate the economy of the game and how all these different random items manage to be useful to someone out there.
---
I'm actually having a great time with PVP, despite being the minority faction (Horde on Anathema) and prime gank-bait levels. As far as I can tell, PVP is a totally different experience on lower-pop servers – I'm outnumbered on average, but I have plenty of opportunities for one-on-ones, and I've been able to open-world quest without getting blown up too frequently. There just aren't enough people for the opposite faction to literally be everywhere all the time.
---
I read the PVP discussions on Reddit and I feel bad for people who hate the PVP experience but fear transferring to a "dead" server. I feel like the "biggest and fullest and most hardcore, otherwise dead" mentally is causing people to miss out. The PVP nightmares you hear about on Reddit aren't universal.
---
Flying to far away solar systems and planets? Mass extinctions?
---
Wish I could find one as an Ele sham.
---
You missed the RPG in MMORPG
---
Typical horde pvp group seems to be 1 rogue and 2 mages, all undead, with a 40-man raid on a short dial. Catching those blinking/sprinting/vanishing/iceblocking dicks before a raid arrives is pretty hard.
---
I play pvp spec druid and I roll with 1 or 2 other rogues/druids. Wpvp with stealth is not bad even if you're outnumbered
---
And you're dodging my question.  It has nothing to do with groups, and everything to do with there is zero effective difference to the player on the receiving end of a gank by 5 players grouped together or by a multiboxer playing 5 characters.  In both cases, 5 characters overwhelmed them, and in both cases that player would need to get a group together to fight them if they chose to do so.
---
But go ahead and keep acting like you have a point other than whining about something that Blizzard has taken an official stance on being fine with for 15 fucking years.
---
Nice, now you don't have to pop lay on hands as quickly
---
I'm sorry to hear about your personal circumstances dude, I've been having a shit year too with deaths in the family and other crises. 
---
Old friends of mine, real-life friends, and my sister were all really excited for Classic. We all played together from the tail-end of Vanilla up until BFA, so we've been a life-long guild essentially. But now there's only two of us playing Classic, and even then we've taken a break because of the PvP aspect being so shit. I knew what I was getting into rolling on a PvP server. I love PvP and the random encounters in the wild, but roving gangs of death-squads ganking you over and over again, groups of up to ten level 60's camping flight paths, killing quest NPC's and whatever other forms of griefing that they come up with are bullshit and selfish. 
---
Yeah, people can tell you to "go back to retail," or say, "hurr you rolled on a PvP server, it's your fault," but really, at the end of the day, what do you get out of ruining the experience for other people? From preventing them from playing the game that they pay for just because you think it's funny to be a prick? Fuck that man, it's sad that people have nothing better to do than spend hours upon hours out of there day spoiling the game for everyone else.
---
Yeah we've tried that but it's still failed every time I've tried it. Doesn't help that the whole thing seems to be bugged as well.
---
I submitted a bug and an in game ticket
---
You should join the Fight Club discord, it's where all serious warriors hangout, they have a spreadsheet you can download that you can use to sim your dps, enter race, gear, all that stuff to get a exact answer of what's better.
---
But yes, of course 2h dps will look better in a dungeon, it's where sweeping strikes and whirlwind can shine in short fights with bursty damage but how will it fare in 1 mob boss fight?
---
And no slam spec sucks for horde warriors, you got windfury.
---
"You just push whatever comes off CD and glows" vs. "frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt"
---
2 great games we have here lads
---
Yeah but it's not a noob friendly class.
---
Calm down nerd.
---
What’s the current debate for deep prot vs fury/prot if you are pretty well geared from MC/Ony?
---
Well they have. I had to unsub last week. Just can’t play the game and get any modicum of enjoyment out of it as an Alliance player.
---
I’m glad you decided to share your story but out of curiosity what do you mean by griefing? Are you just being killed over and over again? Or are people mind controlling/polymorphing you non-stop?
---
Yes, sir
---
It fits really nicely with the Horde scout tabard. And sorry about ditching your shitty tabard, my honourable GM.
---
You’d likely be way better off reset farming the 3 nodes near the start of BRD than trying to farm the nodes in MC. Some of the spawns are next to packs and can be mined without aggroing, others are on top of them and require a distraction (I used my pet as a hunter). 
---
Even while hitting instance cap, I only made 8 bars over 2 hours, which is ~40g/h. Not that good and really annoying to pull off the mining on some of the nodes.
---
&gt;Does anyone else think the popular culture on Classic is just elitist gamer culture from 2004?
---
Classic's success and re-emergence of old behaviours has shown that it's not players that have changed since the early 2000's, it's the games.
---
I have OCD so this is literally the place I go to first when I enter this zone, cause I know If I don’t I’ll never venture to it.
---
Just because you say flying isnt a bad doesnt mean it isnt bad, thats totally an opinion and usually one thats made by people who really want TBC. The fact theres a divide at all on the issue should be red flags enough. Was there any real divide about people not wanting classic? No even retail WoW players were stoked to try it out.
---
Someone taking control of a specific spot in the world by winning a 1 v 1?
---
They do not.
---
They can make challenging content without doing TBC and flying mounts.
---
Hmmm I hope this ain't true. I'm on Arugal and haven't seemed to notice honor not counting, this is definitely when I PvP most. Maybe I'm losing a chunk. Fuck!
---
On my server alliance dominates the world bosses.   
---
Dont give up!
---
&gt;world of WARcraft not World of 
---
Is it world of corpsecamping craft? Or world of being the biggest-douche-you-can-be craft?
---
You can get another if you delete your character, level back up and do the quest again.
---
Meh, as deep feral you run cat form a bit in non-melee matchups. Against melee it's all bear form (apart from opener as cat), try to get away for heals, and back to bear. Casters and hunters are usually a mix of all forms
---
There was some discussion on wowhead that if you mess up five times.. you need to collect the gems again. I sure don't even want to find out.
---
Indeed, especially as a Paladin.
---
Waiting for your auto attack so you use your seal, judgment, seal and auto attack again, dealing huge damage.
---
Timeless isle has always been one of my favorite times, ability to flag yourself to your faction was a big thing for me.
---
They're the weird looking coinflip warriors that either 1-clap you in PvP, or slowly walk towards you menacingly while dying.
---
Lmfao - Doomgoat at it again. I love Westfall
---
Nope, window jump makes it slightly faster that’s it.
---
As someone who could only afford f2p korean mmo during the mmo days, i can say the game is much more relaxed and there are a ton of fun exploring.
---
This is the real vanilla experience #nochanges
---
So as the show starts to peak and you start getting a good rhythm (besides that disastrous layering and exploiting defense episode) you're gonna wrap it up? Best of luck to you. I imagine it was a very personal decision as the explanation didnt make much sense. But you don't owe us any explanation really.
---
Sad to see the show go as it was really starting to find itself. And with the minimal contribution you give in interviews, by letting your guests do all the heavy lifting,  I really thought this could be pushed to a monthly show at least. But I digress.
---
I wish you luck in all of your future endeavors. You are likable and will do well in anything you do. It was a fun ride. And all the effort you put in with your free time was amazing, so thank you.
---
I'd say a Warlock's job is to put Curse of Tongues on healers and Fear something. Fear has a shorter range than a Warrior's Charge/Intercept and Warlocks have no escape tools. They need to tank hits. SL helps with that.
---
Other specs work because world PvP is just a numbers game and battlegrounds are about coordination. But if you took two groups with equal numbers and equal coordination? You would want your Warlocks to have Soul Link.
---
Ty, this is what i need
---
thats a very screwed logic
---
Theres no real tip or trick to getting an item to drop besides not posting about it and simply doing the dungeon until it drops.  
---
I managed to get it after farming it straight for 8 hours with 2 friends who didnt need it. This was on top of 16 prior kills. Took about 12 mins a run just doing it straight.
---
Resub or check your search history if you've been to their reddit or something.
---
Grid2 is back
---
Well, it's certainly different in PvP for the "frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt" game, whereas PvP is is basically nonexistent currently in the "you push whatever comes off CD and glows" game. And then there's the part about one of these games having classes that are pruned to death...
---
But yeah, two games for different people.
---
There isn't, accounts upgraded from starter edition have their limitations in place for 24hrs after the upgrade.
---
Just wait 3 weeks until AV comes out and get the crossbow from there. It’s better than every other ranged weapon currently in the game (except Rhok’delar). Yes, even the MC weapons. You could try getting Carapace Spine Crossbow until then. 
---
Both crossbows are better than DHC. Oh and don’t forget that Dwarven Hand Cannon’s proc can proc off Scatter Shot and break it instantly.
---
It's no longer even PvP at this point. It's a Horde Honor Vending Machine. Blizzard needs to fix the imbalances.
---
If you think Life Tap is 'VERY inefficient' you have no idea what you're talking about. 
---
Not expecting any healer to do anything extra, beyond not throwing a tantrum because the warlock touches the life tap key. I don't expect a healer to heal my life taps, but I'm not going to ignore the ability because not 100% hp=end of the world.
---
tl;dr "play my way or I won't heal you and you're bullying me."
---
I doubt anyone would notice
---
If the ethnic cleansing continues - you'll get 6h queues. And no AQ gate opening.
---
The formula for easy fights in WoW is max TPS -&gt; max dps -&gt; shortest fight -&gt; skip relevant boss mechanics.  Fury will always be better in a competitive environment with min-maxing in mind.  The healers have to be better to keep up though so its not for every guild.
---
By what metric lol.
---
Dude, there's nothing there. 
---
There's like one single unfinished quests with mad empty dungeons and caves. It's a zone they just forgot to finish.
---
Why are you playing classic then. All the things you personally think are terribad is what many many many many people wanted again. And many many many people literally spoke out against flying mounts and dungeon finder and all that shit because they wanted world pvp and the like all over again. Its not terribad, its what people wanted. Now you want us to come full circle by complaining about this stuff so you get the QoL stuff that basically killed online interaction in this game?
---
Honestly cant really believe its actually happening again.
---
Paladins
---
Thanks, I dropped out of art school for this
---
I would think that it's better for critters because hamstring will still kill the critters with it's damage, while rend will allow a skill + swing since rend doesn't do any damage immediately.
---
I'm glad there isn't one because the amount of cringe edgy names is too high.
---
I would puke in my mouth if I saw Cùmblæster up there and you know there's a shitload nicknames like that today.
---
Watching this acreenshot made me realize how different it used to be. More unique names in one picture than I've seen in 3 months playing classic.
---
I dual box and I get so many people who are weirdly upset by it. Had a few threats of respirating too. I just ignore them.
---
If you ignore every other sentence of context, sure
---
Your a great son and I’ll pray for you. Your humility is beautiful and I hope the best for you. Come to Benediction alliance.
---
What do you mean I go out of my way?
---
I thought that was my /played time at first
---
I fucking love you too

2nd this
---
all of it, the thing procs like a mother fucker. and often procs straight to 3 stacks.
---
If you’re creating a group try to get more casters in it. That might sound obvious but when you farm with PUGs you can get screwed. One rogue wins, leaves the group, another sees you’re doing HOJ farm in LFG and joins. So pug with casters if you can or get some guildies to help you out. Schedule a time to run it for 2-3 hours and offer to help their alts out or something.
---
If you like running dungeons, both Uldaman and Maraudon should be within your level range. Maraudon is a  popular favourite because a lot of classes get their first piece of pre-bis there and also cuz it just looks freaking amazing. The 30-40 grind has always been tougher to me since I really didn't like grinding SM 24/7, so more power to you if you love the dungeon leveling experience.
---
I dont think you know what percentages are.
---
You bug him out with some cool tricks so you don't get hit
---
There really isn't any reason to focus on your action bars. When I raided on retail I kept my bars completely invisible and my unit frames close to my character while not obstructing my vision. I can understand if you want abilities like Mind Blast, Fade, Fear etc enlarged or more visible but there really isn't any reason for spells like Mind Soothe etc to be aswell
---
Details! doesn't track HoJ procs sadly. You'll have to use Recount for that.
---
Pathetic
---
Sounds like Blizzard accurately programmed NPCs to play like humans
---
There is a very triggered alliance rogue in these comments
---
I think legion was genuinely pretty good. I liked the raids, I liked Mythic+ and I liked legendaries too tbh (coming from someone who played a spec that relied 100% on having bis legendaries to do good dps and getting those two legendaries as my last two) but I wished we could have chosen which legendaries we would get instead of it being random.
---
Nope, you've got it all. If she was a melee DPS you can throw money at gear to make things go faster, but as a caster class there's not much you can do.
---
Helping her get groups in the 50+ range by tanking things like BRD while she gears up will be a great help though.
---
This right here. If your tanks are needing titans for current content you have bigger issues than guild gold

Is it weird that I initially thought I could order Paul Rudd’s panther cologne from Anchorman on here?
---
yup missed that lol
---
Still less dps than fresh 60 rogue
---
Same lol, the alliance on my server also stands guard Infront of DM all day, perfect NPC behaviour
---
&gt;You legit just need to play 15h a day, you don't even have to be good at the game, that's typical vanilla philosophy "play more, not better" and I truly hate that. 
---
Well, so play retail or another PvP game with more mechanically challenging content?
---
The RPG elements classic enjoyable
---
You can't summon people into instances anymore? I didn't know it was like that in classic, my bad.
---
They did. But I think it was for goblin neutral city guards only.
---
Happened to me a few times after cleansing them myself. Dont know what's going on either... gave up on it for now.
---
You should be working for Blizzard already.
---
Yeah, to get somewhere classic requires a lot of time investment.
---
And the more time you put into the game, generally the stronger your character becomes.
---
Justice has arrived
---
Day 1 of PvP I logged on for the epic world massacre, racked up around 2k kills, logged out. Next day I logged in and had nothing for the previous day, still not sure what happened
---
I'm using that as a Lock and am fine it it rather then losing my mind over the actual BiS offhand (Drakestone of Shadow Wrath)
---
Yea, this is Naxx patch isnt it?
---
I feel really emotional about this so it's reasonable to expect the developers should absolutely definitely be considering this in their software. It's legit a part of my gameplay so how can it be justifiable that a bug would exist here?
---
I know this is super old, but I wanted to clarify something. Offhand sword hits can proc sword spec and grant an extra swing. The way it actually works is that it finishes the swing timer on your mainhand sword. Because of this, it's really important to have a sword in offhand with a few exceptions. Those exceptions would probably be something like felstriker. Although I'd just recommend you go combat daggers if you have felstriker. 
---
Sorry for the necro. I was researching something tangential.
---
Yes it is, almost everything in classic requires a lot more commitment than it does in retail.
---
Yes, mythic raiding is way more difficult, but the rest of retail is more or less tuned towards anyone and their mom being able to complete the game.
---
He set fun not mind numbingly stupid, bug ridden and frustrating where every failure is 30 mins of running to get a new disguise, waiting for Tyrion to respawn, then crawling with him through hearthglen and praying the opposite faction doesn't show up and dispel your disguise so you have to fight lvl 60 elites. Then when you finally get to the end, sometimes he just dies and his dad doesn't show up.
---
No I'm not mad that I lost 3 hours to do this fucking stupid buggy shit quest at all.
---
You can't argue for shit as to why shamans is supposedly equal to paladin, because there is nothing to back up your conjecture.  
---
Resorting to 'nu-hu' and insluts when I call you out, pathetic.
---
What elitist culture from 2004? Nobody cared back then.
---
You cant swap them in combat, if you have a way to get out of combat during a fight (specifically hunters and rogues), you can swap them then
---
It would be a complete shitshow
---

At 60, completing the quest chain nets like 60g.

Used to be a huge google doc post just for rogues on reddit I’ll try to link if I find
---
Herod isn’t an alliance hellhole like it’s made out to be. Alliance has been dominating BRM for at least a week and has more logins lately.
---
I think you're overestimating the procc rate.
---
I \*think\* her best bet at that level would be to find 3 similarly-leveled mages and priest, then start AoE farming dungeons. I think doing Cath until \~45 and ZF until \~52, and then from there you can tank dungeons to speed up those final few levels while also working towards her pre-raid bis stuff.
---
I've boosted people around 30-40 on my Warrior, and I've been boosted in my 20-30s by a mage (sm cath boosting is at least a level an hour in the 20s). I've found that the mage just does a faster job than my warrior, but both options seem to be a bit light on xp compared to appropriately-leveled aoe/cleave groups. For example, a 60 mage boosting my level 45 warrior through ZF saw a pittance of XP (\~6-6.5k per run clearing all the zombies, so \~28-32k xp/hr?) farming graveyard zombies - while I hear good aoe/cleave groups manage to hit somewhere like 70-100k/hr there.
---
FWIW I've only done some limited AoE farming on one character, so I'm fuzzy on some of the details here.
---
Also randomly getting delay on a tick and then getting 40 energy after 4 seconds.
---
The lack of Tactical Mastery makes it a non starter for me.
---
Are you smoking meth?
---
wat
---
thanks
---
I've personally never seen more than 1 drop in a run in classic after 10 live side clears. With pugs typically reserving the first orb (and only orb that drops in my case) to tanks, I now just steer clear of Stratholme.
---
That's weird, my experience was that I was running into horde each time I tried to cross zones, but I never saw alliance players use a similar tactic. I also never saw alliance loitering around dungeon entrances. I only saw that one gnome warrior eternel loitering around the path to brd onve, but I never saw multiple alliance camping the path to there either.  I got up to level 50 before I rerolled pve and the whole leveling experience on  Netherwind felt lonely.
---
We got 4 OEBs in two weeks.... Lucky af
---
Glorious
---
&gt;There are TBC server which are still running and populated like netherwing.
---
One server that might have a peak of 1k players. Its not a healthy pool at all, and I played on that server on release. Its very high quality.
---
&gt;How is having everything slow a good thing? Do you like to afk 10m on a fly to get to a dungeon? Do you like getting ganked and outnumbered in wpvp? 
---
Because it makes the game into a MMORPG, not a sit AFK in Shattrath and for summons type of game. Or like retail, where you just use the dungeon finder.
---
&gt;How can you say that wrath is good because it's accessible to casual with arenas without being too easy when TBC has accessible arenas too and the world is "harder" on TBC than wrath, your point makes no sense at all
---
I don't think wrath is good, but it is the other expac beyond vanilla that actually has great success in the pserver market. And I think its partly because it is easy, but its the right type of easy that a lot of people enjoy. Hence superior retail.
---
I wouldn't play wrath, but at least that version has a dedicated following unlike the ghosttown TBC servers.
---
[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure)
---
those guys dont value your time at all lol
---
Level 44 is the half way point. 
---
Do a /played at 44 and that’s roughly how long it’ll take you to get to 60 from there.
---
Its size does remind me of a typical classic server back in the day, which I really enjoy.
---
Hi, I played throughout both. I loved vanilla and am thoroughly enjoying classic. However TBC was, in my opinion, a better game. It took all the things I loved from vanilla and improved on them (particularly class balance, challenging PvE content, and the introduction of skill based rewards for PvP).
---
Be prepared to die a lot until u figure it out.
---
U do realize 50g is very fast to farm right?  Even flat herbalism without considering black lotuses can get you 50g in under 2 hours.
---
To be honest, not so good right now. But I think it is my fault a little. I was super hyped for the game and startet as an shaman. It was great fun till the late 40. Like from 45 till 52 (max level for my shaman right now) it was sooo slow and boring. I leveled as enhancer and also tryd ele, but Booth feel just super slow.
---
The game itself is amazing so I level a druid (I love hybrid classes) and I am level 50 with him now. The killspeed and gameplay are a lot more fun than shaman to me, but what bother me now is that I do the same stuff I did on my shaman allready. So I log in every 2 days or so for 1 to 2 hours and I feel like I will never reach level 60. If I had startet as a druid first I think I would be 60 allready for like 3-4 weeks.
---
I just hope I can keep going till 60. I want to see some of the dungeons at max level so much. 
---
Also - I play on a German server that is "only" medium in population. And I play mostly at night or morning. It can be hard to find people for elite quests or dungeons.
---
I use cat for single target mobs, if more than 1 then go bear.
---
Ummm, to many drugs?
---
somebody is a mad ass ally
---
The gear people are wearing in this photo though, lol  
---
Everyone is so obsessed with BiSSSSSSSSSSSSS now every raid is just truestrike shoulders and staff of ogre magi running around lol
---
Because in 1 hour u can get 0 arcane crystals but in 2 hours you can get 3 arcane crystals and a blue sapphire. Not very hard to understand. Not to mention that you get demonic runes/essence of water/rares that sell well/green bops that can turn into eternal essences if ur 2nd prof is enchanting.
---

Look everyone, the guy who's unable to communicate with words doesn't like the word "meme"!

Do u even play classic?

To the Horde player crossing the street wearing green with a hat that said "Ooooh" at 4:32 PM last Wednesday by that one tree and the guy walking behind him who yelled at me

yes.

You can do a cast sequence macro, but you have to click it twice.
---
Please bring back tbc, it was my favorite flavor of wow.
---
Who says they’re getting world buffs in a guild like that
---
She's actually a bit more understanding with Wow than anything else. I made her an account so she plays occasionally as well. There's so much to teach her but she doesn't always want to listen so I'm trying to get her to watch a beginners guide for hunters but so far no luck. She'd probably have an easier time of getting the mechanics if the material is concise and organised, as I tend to get a bit worried I'm giving TMI to her.
---
Tl;dr not much changes, more good
---
I didn't realize I would get like 7 replies so i'm just picking you, Regrowth and rejuv are the main spells you really use literally until tier 2 5 piece, and even then your not going to be using healing touch much.
---
Regrowth's initial impact heal is a scale of 13%, Rejuv is 4 ticks 20% each. You are gaining +13 to healing on regrowth for every 130+ healing, and rejuv is about on average 30-40% overheal so your getting very minimal value from any form of + healing scale on that too. Literally the only thing that matters as a druid is being able to actually spread rejuv and regrowth to enough people. If you get +10% to healing in talents its the equivalent of +1,200 healing gear on regrowth, imp rejuv + improved healing which is 25% is the equivalent of approximately 340+ ish?
---
Unlike every other healing class your actual heal scale is really really garbo.
---
o look a picture from your phone of your computer, you dont deserve help lol
---
We had 3 yesterday, i rolled the first, not bad for a first Strat run on my lvl 57 hunter.
---
The eye is the easy part. The hammer, worth ~8k gold in mats, is what you should thank your guild for.
---
right now there are lots of 50s that cannot level.  If you can find a warrior that wants the sgc, then you could reserve both the hoj nd the sgc, and still likely find people that will come just for the exp.
---
NE just ressed and mounted up, instantly a horde is there and looking at him.
---
If I understood dungeon xp right, she'll get more xp if there is 5 party members. Someone told me (don't quote me on it) that xp per kill is calculated on an average level of the whole group, not the highest LVL player in the group
---
There's 2 or 3 warriors with it ally side, and I think 2 enhance shams on horde side but idk about warriors on horde side.
---
Was bored about a week ago and figured that I had skipped SFK while leveling, so I thought I'd go there and just go through it. Shadowfang dropped about half way in. Sold it on AH for 230g and could finally afford my epic mount. Lucky me!
---
I love maths
---
I'm not sure exactly where dw overtakes 2h, but every 2h warrior I come across owns the dps charts, and I have all pre raid BiS and 1 raid piece.  I'm tempted to swap over myself.
---
How would it be implemented better that would cause people to not kill you for honour?
---
I felt weirdly motivated
---
The same reason overwatch doesn't have a scoreboard. The same reason why mmr is hidden. Because it promotes toxicity when people have actual numbers to compare.
---
You don’t miss what you don’t know.
---
I think it's the counterpart or male version of witch, not sure tho
---
See streamer. Immediately downvote.
---
Yea lets go by the numbers, Classic tripled WoW subs, the biggest increase in the games history.
---
Vanilla wasnt as known as TBC and WOTLK, in TBC and WOTLK u started to see the ingame in TV ads. WOTLK had more subs than TBC, and its endlessly worst. Just like TBC is worst than vanilla.
---
Damn what's it like to be able to make it from Ironforge to BRM/BRD in less than 20 minutes?
---
a 3.5 second cast (before talents or set bonuses) benefits from 100% spell power  
---
an instant cast benefits from 15% spell power  
---
it is a linear relationship between those 2  
---
\[(.85)cast time/3.5 + (.15)\] x spellpower = bonus  
---
a channelled spell or DoT gets the benefit for the total damage, so it is split into each tick evenly
---
Man, can you imagine if that beak went into the poop chute a bit?
---
Im talking about 40 man pvp raids, not raid content
---
It's a mixed bag for me. I have a level 60 Fury Warrior and a level 27 Mage. I loved leveling and exploring, but the more I play the more I realize that I kind of hate the game itself.
---
The world and lore is fun, although I really wish there were more of it. Most quest chains boil down to "some bad guys did something here and we're mad about it, go stop 'em." but there are certain ones that stand out. 
---
The Stonetalon area was great, all the quests were related to the deforestation and various tribe's efforts to deal with it. Jin'Zil's forest magic was a hell of a surprise on turn in. ahaha I also adored Desolace. So bleak and beautiful, and with a really unique mechanic in the tribal loyalty quests! The Kodo Graveyard was so spooky and memorable.
---
As an undead I LOVED Scarlet Monastery. Unlike a lot of content that feels kind of random, I could really imagine my character's motivations for fighting those undead hating bastards. And what a twist when you get to Cathedral and find &gt;!their leader is infected!!&lt; And although I missed Uldaman when I was on level I ran in at level 60 out of curiosity and OMG it's awesome. The visual effect when you put the staff into the map of the city and a beam of light shoots into the door? I was actually really glad I got to experience the first time by myself with no distractions. I probably wouldn't have even noticed in a group!
---
Which brings me around to the stuff I really don't like.... social anxiety. Holy hell, I was not expecting this game to trigger me as much as it does! I had heard it was social, but I thought they meant that it encourages you to talk and be friendly. I did not expect to have to ask for help constantly (something I absolutely cannot do in real life and that makes me feel incompetent/annoying/dependent/bad). Also, Need/Greed and feeling like I could destroy the morale of my group if I choose the wrong one.
---
"Why need on that? That's a Paladin item! What a moron ahahahaha" Well, uh, I saw armor and strength. I've never played this game how the hell am I supposed to know that Strength + Int=Paladin? I'm not playing a paladin.
---
Then there's tanking. Good lord. I'm boss at holding threat. I set marks and make sure the ranged units aren't hitting the casters. We're going at a steady pace and we're not wiping. So why is everyone complaining? Mages and Warlocks always want to go faster, some healers want me to wait until they're full mana to pull, others get mad if I wait until they are full. 
---
Everyone expects you to know every route, boss, and shortcut of every dungeon and god forbid you make a wrong turn in the labyrinthine hellholes that are BRD or Maraudon or Wailing Caverns. Even though I studied these encounters in depth before going in and I had detailed maps and strategies pulled up on my second monitor nobody ever gave me time to actually READ the damn things and so I ended up just wandering blindly anyway. Not to mention the maps are useless because *they show paths that are on different floors and aren't even connected as if they are side by side.* UGH. 
---
Dungeons were some of the most interesting areas, but I felt like I could never enjoy them because I was being rushed through and mocked for my lack of expertise. Horrible.
---
Then after I'm stressed as hell and mentally fatigued from dungeons, there's no way to chill out by myself because I'm a warrior and I need help to do virtually any quest that involved grouped mobs. Which is....a lot of quests.
---
By the time I hit my fifties I was so sick of it that I grinded 55-60 on plaguebats just so I didn't have to talk to or compete with anybody. So that took about 4 times longer than it should have, just because I was too intimidated to step into Stratholme or Scholomance.
---
The whole time I was trying to catch up to my RL friend, and I never did. So when I hit 60 I was very excited to be able to hang out and do stuff... only to find that I'm still behind because apparently there's a whole grind after 60 that basically amounts to extremely time consuming gambling. And of course my friend already had all his BiS and had been doing MC for a month. So even then I'm still not contributing anything meaningful to dungeons, I'm just being escorted through like someone's kid brother while he evasion tanks because I literally can't hold threat against a geared rogue.
---
Which brings me to PVP................I don't really want to start an argument but I really think it's dumb. The fact that you can't use abilities while moving makes combat feel stilted, slow, and awkward compared to the games I'm used to. The fact that so many abilities have long cast times or don't hit until your next autoattack makes the interface feel unresponsive even though it is, and the fact that you can miss/resist key abilities and lose just because of RNG is frustrating.
---
Being in a guild has proven to be pretty nerve wracking as well, mostly because I was late to 60. There weren't any tank slots and by that point I had intense anxiety about my lack of experience. I had nightmares about wiping my raid in MC because of some stupid mistake. So it was kind of a relief that I had to respec dps, but it also made finding groups and generating income impossible. Nobody wants a Fury warrior in a bunch of lvl 50 blues! I also don't have much EP so it's going to be a long time before I can catch up. 
---
In theory being in a guild should make it easier to do content, but in reality there are already cliques of people within the guild who are friends and I usually only get invited if my RL friend (whose an officer in the guild) is building the group. Nothing makes you feel more like the GM's girlfriend than that!
---
Endgame, as far as I've seen, is just a second job that you don't get paid for. It's a rat race, and if you don't match the time devoted by your social group then you'll quickly become useless and a waste of a party slot. In the beginning I falsely believed that I could reach a point where I was on par and I could live my life again, but the pace of Phases has made it so that I never reach that finish line. I've resorted to arcanite transmutes and potion making just to make sure that I'm contributing to the guild even though I'm behind.
---
All in all, I honestly don't know why I'm still playing but every month I shell out for the subscription. I guess because I've come this far and quitting feels like I just wasted months and months of my life? Because after fifteen days of played time I can *finally* hang out with my bro and it's tons of fun? idk man, but thanks for asking. Writing this was therapeutic, I think I needed that. ahahaha
---
Where are the people that like WOTLK? The fact that it had more subs 10 years ago means literally nothing, cant believe how hard it is for you to grasp that.
---
When I found out HOW you're supposed to play an arms warrior (avoid heroic strike unless you're overflowing with rage, and spam sunder armor and throw up a rend and such), it began to get more fun. The truth however is I hate auto attacks. They're so slow, and I can't even imagine how much worse it would be if I was wielding (Stoneslayer? Which weapon am I thinking about that has a speed of 4.00?). I'm sure it's damnably powerful, but the long wait between swings would drive me insane.
---
Probably why I'm enjoying the heck out of rogue, one of the classes *all* about instant attacks.
---
Arms warriors are certainly some of the most powerful melee attackers (if not the most powerful), but I want to throw out special attacks, not sit there watching my character grow rage (WHEN he grows rage, because unless he's tanking (which yes, I know he can do until about 50 as an arms warrior), his rage growth is slow as heck).
---
You can do that with Spy afaik. Haven't tried it myself but I accidentally right-clicked the Spy button that appears on their portrait and it allowed me to type KOS reason.
---
You can set it up now shittily.
---
I was thinking about starting a 40 man VR raid guild... would be hard as fuck
---
Whenever I meet a new player or refugees who have rerolled I’ll give them a bag if I hav extra, welcome to Azeroth!
---
You made 0 fuckin sense. Am i supposed to play the same game over and over again untill i die or "its not for me", holy shit you are idiotic.
---
O K B O O M E R
---
Oh that makes sense if you rerolled before World PvP. Horde at the moment is getting rekt/not bothering with PvP. UC and Ogr is constantly raided during the weekends as well as Zeppelin camping. EPL and WPL is constantly being ganked by packs of Ally lol.
---
You are talking like its not easier to get gear.

Elemental shaman are completely broken in classic. Their burst-alpha damage can only be rivaled by pom-pyro fire mages, and you can absolutely annihilate players if they're running around in their Raid/non-stam gear.

I've stopped my shaman leveling at 47 so she's a gray honorless to 60s, yet she can kill them.

Flying brings 0 positives to the game, it just how utterly uninspired and half assed flying is, its literally swimming in the air. It makes the world smaller and less meaningfull, it makes world pvp non-existant, you can skip content with flying mounts, just to fluckin swim in the air, worth it? Absolutly not.
---
Bloodfang feels great, thanks for confirming that with numbers
---
Farming. Questing. Whatever you're up to in Azshara.

I appreciate the art, but r/wow doesn't cross the other way, fren
---
BRE is hands down better than Hand of Rag in PVP. I don't know where you are getting your info from but it is well known that BRE is by far the best of them.
---
As an engineer you get a plethora of useful trinkets and gadgets, most which are OP in PvP, some are good for PvE aswell. Most notably are the Goblin Sapper Charge and Thorium Grenade. You also get Jumper Cables, detect invis goggles, teleportation trinkets, etc. 
---
I can tell you even if there wasn't any bombs to increase DPS or whatnot, I'd still go engineering over any profession every day of the week for all the gamechanging, convenient items 
---
TL:DR other professions give you nothing, engineering gives you something. Get it!

Hahah another shitty rogue who cant play. Guess how many times good rogues complained about Spy. All the rogues here whining are so pathetic its hillarious :D

Which seems acceptable if  you want a balance game with healthy population, and is way more important than some economics disruption. Period.

And its actually against the TOS and banable to do that.

Are you afraid to be less rich than those filthy casual?
---
No that was not th case I was inspecting him in order to see if he needed his 3P tier which was way better then my 5 set tier. So i was like "do you need to make your tier bonus?" He said yes so I way going to give it to him anyways he tossed me the gold as a tip for doing it remember this is a officer as well that was part of the guild. So all the officers Okayed it and then kick for it.
---
Cool, still visible through walls tho, did you even read my comment?
---
There are a lot of factors to your question for MC/ony. Fury prot can tank anything atm but I would not blindly follow. You as a player should feel this out. When you adjust do it because you know you can.
---
I would strongly recommend if puging raids or if casual guild crushing pixels to start out as shield/prot. Confirm survival then slowly move to fury dual prot. 
---
Your fury dps for threat is irrelevant if the raid is not on the same level. Good dps speeding up the encounter and healers covering your hp swings. Know your encounters also. Fury prots switch to sword and board often.
---
Happy not really. was my only choice with the late nights I raid.
---
It depends on what spawns.
---
&gt;Flying is a nice convenience
---
because it allows you to skip most of outdoors content.
---
I used to use an addon called autobar for this.   Not sure if there's a classic version
---
To a degree yes. Elitism and min maxing is def. more wide spread than back in the day. But your also just not seeing much of all those casual players because they hardly participate on forums ...
---
Copngrats. you are a champ for downvoing because someone streamed ;) good for you mate. &lt;3 keep up the work here on reddit ;)
---
sameee, when you've rolled through barrens 4 or 5 times in a row on all your alt classes you start to seriously rethink how you want to be playing lol
---
Mage???
---
Playing mage optimally is extremely complex. Basically vs melee classes you win right away... Keep distance with blinks and engineering, shield , spam polymorph, then open with a frostbolt spam and keep kiting weaving in ocassional nova, explosion and fireblast... Watch your mana. No mana = certain death.
---
Vs casters its alot harder, you need to time silenceto perfection, dispell them or yourself, spam polymorph to reset fight&amp;eat and drink . These are basics. For more complex playing you need to play pvp alot and learn by mistakes.
---
He'll be ready to sap again in 10 minutes.

First of all thats not accurate, second of all, is this your life? Counting other peoples comment on a reddit thread? Big yikes from me fam.

Nah, in terms of drops Jed is all healers/casters want for bis.

I started playing for the first time a week after classic was released and got hooked right away. Been really enjoying it! I have around 18 days played on my main and it was a gnarly ride from fresh into playing WoW to joining a guild and raiding weekly. But im at the point of getting out of prebis into the tier sets so it’s exciting!

I really don’t know how I never got into this back in the day but playing it now has been a blast. Now if only I liked farming gold as much as I liked grinding levels/dungeons I would have my epic mount by now
---
They're cheap as shit, just buy them.
---
the armor pen that happens at 11% of time vs a steady 3.7 speed weapon with a top end of 372 vs 310?
---
You blue yourself.
---
Thats what i thought.
---
&gt;which were objectively better in most aspects.
---
And terrible in others.
---
Ill never forget thebsatosfaction i got in tbc by learning thebright box speed to properly weave steady shots.
---
Yeah, same exp for me, it differs from run to run but on avarage it‘s around 3 orbs. Best run i had was with 6 orbs 😎
---
Isn't it VorpX?
---
So you're just not going to get gear or what's the plan then? I'd happily run around the world all day, but there's no loot out there now is there :)
---
Sell tanking for dungeons
---
Yesterday, a day which will live in infamy. Azeroth was invaded by the ground forces of the orcish horde.
---
Azeroth was at that moment unaware of the horde and looking towards peace with the greenskins. Indeed the horde recently sent a diplomat in the form of a raven to assure us that the orcs had no hostile intentions. However, it will be recorded that given the complexity of the dark portal, this attack was planned in advance.
---
That's just for raid's though, right? Your full plate sets are pretty nice. 
---
Beastmaster's not terrible if you hide the helm! But I think its some months before those quests open up. Not sure.
---
It will most likely get a lil upswing in price in P4 when ZG comes out when tailorers will start crafting bloodvine set but rather sell now to have cashflow rather than stockpile.
---
Sounds like you're on the winning side of that picture.
---
I see some people saying that it doesn't seem to be affecting them.  Could it be that the diminishing returns aren't being reset until 8am instead of 3am like people are expecting?
---
So if you kill entirely new people between 3 and 8am, you're not losing any honor, but if you've killed those people before during the day, it's calculating honor including diminishing returns.
---
That's at least one way I could see this happening where it seems to be affecting some people way more than others.
---
Live the dream for all of us
---
Sword spec says hello, and you’re undervaluing the proc regardless.
---
As a Horde player I feel like NE zones are my favourite. Probably the only thing I miss from playing Alliance. Ironforge is mad too.
---
Honestly op shouldn’t have tried to profit off boes he rolled on at all. He’s at fault for being greedy as much as the guild is for overreacting.
---
Found this within 10 seconds of googling : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UxdoP2Z99UdjCxacMy0U2mWdiXYDUCC5h3njL1DEX9M/htmlview#gid=1210440384
---
Really really nice!
---
I’ve got an alt on a PvP server, so when I want to PvP I go there, when I want to play the rest of the game I can.
---
Now j need to play silver again...
---
"PVE happened on a PVE server"  
---
okay? you rolled PVE what did you expect to happen
---
**[03:50](https://youtu.be/GZ_JsXY1470?t=230)**
---
&gt; And he goes, I'll give you 125g for it. Okay, cool!
---
Again, how is that not a sale? While I'm not a legal expert, I don't think that you can use the *it's not the price, it's just a tip* defense to dodge sales tax ~~or solicitation charges, for that matter~~.
---
11% BRE, 4.5% HOR
---
Bye Felicia
---
he took a picture of his monitor with a phone because in 2019 no one knows what a screenshot is
---
but how will he know is IMBA score if he doesnt track it with addons
---
&gt;now every raid is just truestrike shoulders and staff of ogre magi running around lol
---
And why would you not want to go with the best items available?
---
Reading these comments makes me really sad honestly. I wish that people didn’t have these Zerg camp pvp mind sets that make the game impossible for players. All t is doing is making them quit, which means less pvp in the future. Sitting around killing the same 5 alliance or horde over and over isn’t pvp when you have 30+ people doing it. Whenever I’m out and that starts to happen, I drop group and go back to org. It’s dumb just ruining a game for someone for 3-20 honor. A few months ago; this sub was amazing and full of positivity. It’s sad how much salt this phase has caused and how so many people are quitting.
---
These players are the ones who aren't oom every two seconds healing a low level dungeon
---
It’s 2 PPM (11.333%), he’s not wrong. I’m not sure if it can proc 3 stacks in a single swing though...
---
\*spy ping noise\*  
---
\*30 more spy ping noises rapidly\*  
---
\*alerts that 10 players just went stealth\*  
---
o boy
---
You don’t need anything special for BWL. You bring the same consumes you used in MC. You don’t need any resistance gear, just a GFPP for Vael but it’s not mandatory. Holy Water can help with Nef but again it’s not required since it’s a joke of a boss.
---
How often do I need to say that I do not expect leaderboards to affect retention. That is it. Zero. Nada. Waste of money. Nothing you say will change my opinion on that. Bring data or gtfo. What an annoying clown.
---
Warlocks also pray to RNJesus if they want to top out and if they get to many cries they get to meet him as they pull off the tank
---
Name calling? Yikes. You can do better than that.
---
It was a wakeup call when the overworld was actually dangerous and I needed to be careful running around
---
The quests and leveling process were boring, but the community aspect of doing it together made it fun and bearable
---
Idk about others but I don’t give a shit. It’s not even that good it’s just an outlined W.
---
Your test is anecdotal at best. Dozens of players in my guild, myself included, have absolutely not experienced this phenomenon and we frequently play during these hours.
---
I feel like excessive honorless ganking should be punished
---
Thanks, I’ll see if I can find anyone in it.
---
Thanks, from what I gathered BWL isn't massively difficult? What is a GFPP?
---
Take this with a grain of salt. It does not hold true for me or for about a dozen others in my guild. His “test” is hardly scientific.
---
So you actually went to the wowhead page for this and still posted this ??
---
well for starters, the idea of \*the best items available\* is laughable, the total of all the gear is more important, so, for example, you are hit capped and dont need truestrike shoulders, you would benefit more from an item that has more of a stat that boosts your damage (AP/crit) because the excess hit is really not that helpful.  
---
But everyone follows these BiS lists so they are running around "full pre-bis" with like 15% hit and wondering why people are destroying them in dps.
---
I lost like 76 kills cause of this :( And it was a group of 5 of us so it wasnt teeny tiny ones
---
That guy probably downvoted my post.
---
no it doesnt, pls stop
---
Agreed. This is one of the most hilarious “tests” I’ve seen so far. Sample size is weak and he ignores evidence that disagrees with his theory.
---
Because it isn’t good for warriors.
---
idk, i was flying out to azshara to get my quintessence for the week and i got ganked by 6 people when i landed and instantly died... i didn't think it was fun but that's just me
---
Yeah wow classic is pretty fun and all but id rather exist at the same time where retail is actually a good game.
---
Why do I need data to argue against your argument with no data? Your opinion is worthless. The only annoying clown is you, because you act like your financing education means something at all, when it doesn't.
---
Greater Fire Protection Potion. BWL has room for failure, but it's very small imo
---
It all depends on your raiders but ever since going fury/prot my dps likes me a lot more since they can go hard very fast and not risking over aggroing. 
---
Am I vulnerable and is at risk of dying sometimes because im dual wielding with 4.9k unbuffed hp instead of keeping shield block up? Sure. Fury prot is a lot more volatile in terms of survivability but if ur healers can play it's fine. But 4k crits from core hounds and such is quite scary.
---
If they don't give honor I don't kill them, unless they're paladins. Fuck paladins.
---
Incorrect. You’d want to bring greater shadow prot pots also.
---
This just isn’t true. I can confirm that it has not affected me or anyone in my guild playing these hours (a good many). Players are so quick to take a **theory**, run a shitty test with a low sample size, and slap “CONFIRMED” on the title.
---
Yeah but I don't understand the point of his idea, why would you want to do that?
---
You’d get the bonus crit on frozen target too. Pretty sure nova &gt; CS &gt; AP &gt; PoM &gt; Pyro &gt; fire blast &gt; blast wave &gt; CoC would annihilate anything in the game by a large margin.
---
10g an hour is pitiful and making 10g an hour at a low level on purpose is my definition of absolutely inefficient.
---
Also, invoking "playing the AH" is a completely separate point from anything to do with what level you are.
---
I must be in your raid.
---
The Gadgetzan guards don't favor horde. What you experienced there is something both factions do to each other - shitty people being shitty.
---
I rolled on loot and then sold it and my guild was not cool with that so I made a video to whine  
---
no, watch out for these kind of people lol
---
ArcheAge? What server did you play on?
---
For those shadowbolts that have a chance of hitting you for 500 damage? I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
Was it...vanilla?
---
The fact that our server has more good guilds/players per capita thatln other servers. (Stalagg-alliance)
---
I just give them 10% cheaper than the rest and it's the same thing.
---
Arms is the best tanking spec for dungeons even in a 5 or 10 man group so this is kind of a moot point.
---
I’m one of them, if you didn’t ding 60 before p2 you have no chance IMO
---
Auto attacks are literally most of the melee damage every melee class does lol what even is this post about
---
Except he literally creates YouTube videos on a different account name.
---
I love how its the same conplaint everytime, "the games unplayable, cry, cry, cry" "horde and meanies" i play horde and have lost count of the times i have been ganked by a group of alliance. This isnt a you problem or an alliance problem. This is a, you rolled and a pvp server problem and are angry at pvp.
---
The fact you would even consider blizzard making guards not aggro to horde is insane. There are many things in classic that can be exploited or used to gain an advantage, regardless of faction there is people out there who will use these.
---
It looks exactly like NamePlateCooldowns for retail, but cant seem to find it for classic, want it aswell :(
---
that's fucking adorable
---
&gt; Takes me 4 deaths to get on the boat 
---
dude do you even WoW? lol, you can get on the boat and die and you will just rez on the other side, still on the boat. Then you jump and swim to the FP  
---
Sounds like you just arent even attempting to adapt to the world
---
yeah whoever wrote this thinks warlocks need to bring demonic runes xD
---
Early on I had most runs drop 4-7 orbs, then 4 weeks in noticed substantially less, per run 0-4 per run.
---
You need one of your leatherworkers to turn in Onxyia head to learn the recipe for the onyxia cloak. Skinning Onyx gives you 2-3 scales per kill and you need 1 scale per cloak.
---
Which dream? Beating tanks on the charts?
---
Obviously they're not required for warlocks, but they're not useless to warlocks since they're off the GCD. That said the Felwood Roots are obviously better:)
---
On arugal as well, farmed some people while grinding my frostsaber. I did get honour for them.
---
None of the content is massively difficult if you're at an appropriate gear level for the content (what is considered appropriate simply has a higher standard the future through raids that you progress).
---
***
---
It's fundamentally no different to retail where you have certain guilds trying to push world first in the absolute bare minimum that they can get away with. Give it a raid reset or two (to add some new pieces) and suddenly things that were nigh impossible become very much do-able. Any consumables you do consume is essentially just 'paying' for the possibility of getting some loot 1 week sooner, but it really is quite binary, either you have the minimum threshold required to consider the content on farm status, or you don't for another week.
---
They could have put that in without demolishing the whole place.
---
I'm not a boomer I have a phone.  Thanks.
---
Well every bit helps right. I'm looking for what's optimal, not what's "good enough"
---
Well how about helping them you elitist snob 😂
---
That's because it's still an dps increase for the hardcore players
---
Casual scum. Twwoo
---
Funfact: if you see such behavior in neutral towns, document and report it as since 12th of November its against ToS :) my friend was "warned" for it a week ago with explanation if he continues to do so, he will get banned
---
Maaaan bwl wont come until like feb/march
---
Relax and enjoy PvP :)
---
Gee if only there was a way to avoid pvp... if only there were pve servers
---
I understand. My guild asks of everyone to play to the best of their ability, before and during raids. I don't mind getting consumables and even flasks, and neither do my guildies hopefully
---
No changes doesnt matter anymore because they've already made changes that over populated all the servers. In vanilla there wouldn't have been enough horde on the server to camp every flight path
---
If you are looking for something to prep now... buy an Ony Cloak. They will skyrocket in price on BWL release. 
---
Resistance is a help. BWL will not be as easy as MC.
---
In the business world this is known as a "career limiting move".
---
I sprung for runecloths at 38 because they were as low as 2.75g. Made the next two levels much more pleasant to grind out and farm the gold for my mount. Highly recommended 10/10
---
Nah, it's shitshow for Horde too, I think there are more pre-made Alliance deathsquads, in raids than Horde ones.
---
My PVP raidgroup have all experienced this, so have hundreds in comments. If you arn't pvping at those hours you arn't affected. But its a real and happening event.
---
Yep. Gonna bet 10g that this post is 100% pure garbage until proven otherwise
---
OmniCC shows the cooldowns without a number, so the clock effect. I believe you need a specifc WeakAuras addon to get the actial number of seconds
---
You can solo it or if you dont feel you are that good its piece of cake for 2 stealth classes. And best part is timewisely its as long as regular run
---
It's epic. It is like lucid dreaming.
---
+dmg gear helps a lot! Dreamweave/shadoweave and staff of Jordan with 30 sp if you're feeling baller. You can also do mobtagging to level quickly.
---
You most likely are losing a chunk.
---
You're creating a socially awkward situation that makes people uncomfortable. By saying "no tip necessary" you're implying that people *should* tip, so if they don't they will feel bad about it. If they do tip, they will worry that they didn't tip enough, or tipped too much.
---
Setting a fixed price takes away the uncertainty, and the anxiety that goes along with it.
---
Gitgud
---
TLDW; BoE warlock belt drops. OP doesnt need it, but rolls for it anyway as 'offspec', since its a warlock belt. Because its offspec for everyone they call it a 'free roll'. OP downtalks freeroll as "i can do with it whatever i want because its freeroll", but its only freeroll among the warlocks so you cant actually do anything with it (equip&amp;wear for offspec, not sell/trade). OP then decides to sell the BoE to another raidmember, therefor breaking the rules.
---
We have two ele shamans on today MC run signed up :) you probably simply just hang around wrong ppl.
---
Hey! I'm on EU Earthshaker. How bad is the ganking situation there? I'm a level 47 alliance player. I don't have game time right now, but if I won't be able to play anyways I wait until bgs.
---
Nah, Plaguelands is Alliance dominated and sometimes there's a whole raid in Ruins of Lordaeron, also I feel that the Alliance is more organized in PvP. Badlands pass usually dominated and Plaguelands is Alliance controlled, Bulwark is a death-zone.
---
I think that might be [Threat Plates](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/threat-plates-classic)?
---
I currently use an older version that doesn't offer enemy timers, but it looks very similar. The addon page mentions it now uses `LibClassicDurations`, which provides the necessary tracking stuff by monitoring your combat log to know when enemy buffs/debuffs/auras/spells/etc happen and estimating their duration from its database.
---
Mage or rogue are the easiest for sure. Warlock isn’t too hard either but slightly harder than those two.
---
It doesn't have to be spell batching, but it's likely that the talents indeed load later.
---
Yes most people are nice, but the ones that I remember are the not nice ones. And over time I developed a really intense fear of failure just because I never forgot any of the bad runs and all my mistakes stacked up in my mind. My main problem is anxiety not other players, like I said in my write up.
---
Bad experiences probably only happened in one out of ten groups, but I ruminated on each of those mistakes until they made me feel like I was just really shit at the game and ruining other people’s fun. It really wasn’t until just yesterday when my guild leader told me I had the best damage out of all warriors on this week’s Ragnaros despite having half as many BiS that I realized this inferiority complex was a construct of my mental problems.
---
It’s unfortunate, but it had a major impact on my enjoyment of the game and so I thought it was worth mentioning. It’s something I had not anticipated because I’m very comfortable chatting and meeting people, and I don’t normally have this kind of social anxiety in RL because I am free to handle my problems by myself without cause for comparing my performance to others. 
---
In WoW everything is parsed, publicly viewable, and scrutinized by the minmax players. Its pretty intense for a new player trying to keep up with veterans and trying not to say anything that makes you look like an ignorant monkey. Even if people don’t mean to be judgemental, at a certain point being surrounded by experts erodes whatever small degree of confidence you have. Its just human nature.
---
Druid is great for PvP in classic. Great flag carriers, innervate, combat ress, CC and utility. 
---
You'll also have an easy time getting into raids if you so wish (the best gear for PvP unfortunately comes from raiding)
---
I use Neatplates for a similar effect. It has many different skins so could possibly be that. It’s what you’re looking for anyway.
---
I'm probably going to focus more so on wpvp and raiding. Nothing like rank 14 or anything hardcore competitive lol it will be interesting to pvp as a mage a first for everything I suppose lol
---
Yep you got fucked
---
bruh i have a character that im only leveling with a friend  
---
we've been 39 for like 3 days and i just wanna ding 40 and get my mount, log the fuck on damnit
---
Still level 40, at this rate I should be 60 by next Christmas
---
Because my time to find the
---
mages that will do it for free
---
 is worth more than 1 g.
---
I feel like I just read a report on a piece of alien technology because this made absolutely no fucking sense to me lol.
---
lol, MUCH easier, given I wouldn't dare log WoW while at work :p
---
I think questing is a really bad money method. It is just worse than grinding the usual spots.
---
&gt; buy an Ony Cloak 
---
Unless he's in a guild, because they will give it to him for free.
---
I know what you are saying, and I know there are horde groups doing this.  But I'm saying the Alliance are doing exactly the same thing.  I've had to wait by the Searing Gorge FP dead while the flight master respawns too.  I've died 4 or 5 times trying to get up the ramp to the flight point only to find him dead and me having to either log out or wait until the group disperses.  The same stuff is happening on the other side too.  In Camp Mojache I've died 3 times this weekend getting from the inn to the fp which is just down the ramp - resulting in me just logging cause I don't have time to speak to the flight master and leave.  And that's IN a horde camp.
---
Like you, I am dying multiple times just getting to a point to quest.  And even if I get to do some questing (which has been extremely limited)  I might kill a couple of mobs before ally turn up and kill me.  If I'm doing it wrong, then you are too cause what you are describing is happening to me too - whether you want to believe it or not.
---
Neat. Curious about the flavours?
---
Im not looking to quest for gold (if you would have read the post more carefully), besides farming anything that isn't instanced is close to impossible on my realm besides from 01-07
---
If we don't get universal healthcare it won't be worth the non-elites living anyways
---
Well that explains that... how on earth did they screw that up?
---
I think streamer worship is too strong for people to leave faerlina, as long as the streamers are there, their fans are staying. They sure do complain a lot about the queues tho lmao
---
Well you change to shield depending on the pull/fight. In dungeons if you fucked it up and pull two groups then you put a shield on for example.
---
I hear alot that druid is bad during classic I was either resto or boomie when it came to rolling druid, I always like the dps I did in pvp as druid.  But I've heard boomie is not very good in pvp or pve in classic... I've been sort of hesitant to roll druid even thi they're one of my favorite classes o started a mage and I live the mage alot too so many classes to choose its painful sometimes lol
---
Oh I had no idea. I've been dropping magma totem when there's a rogue about
---
As a healer I would say fury/prot is far superior.
---
"I'd enjoy the game much more on a PvE server, but PvE is for sissies so I quit instead"
---
its not like activision and blizzard are partners.
---
activision blizzard is a dumb name for what used to be called vivendi
---
and actibliz outright owns blizzard.
---
the only way to separate is for actibliz to be willing to sell blizzard, and someone be willing and able to put up the cash that they would want for it.
---
&gt;Getting loot every dungeon run was something totally alien to me.
---
don't worry that feeling goes away once you get to the last of what you need and you run strat live 30 times for a blue neck  
---
no im not salty :)
---
Playing a druid in PvP there's not much room for any other spec than balance/resto hybrid. I can recommend checking out the 50K$ Dueling Tournament on YouTube for an idea of what druids playstyle looks like
---
If you don't meet players what's the point of not flying? You're contradicting yourself, either you meet players and it's annoying either you don't meet players and in this case flying doesn't change anything
---
You can still tank dungeons as a fury warrior really easily all you need is some plate gear. Tanking dungeons is also a great way to network and make friends within your guild outside of your one RL friend. The guild I joined I barely knew anyone but when they figured out I could tank well I got invites to do dungeons all the time. Honestly don't feel like you're behind fury warriors don't even get much gear in MC so if I were you I would just try to tank runs with my guildies to farm my fury pre BIS and use that as a way to grow within the guild. Don't stress out about not knowing the endgame duneons well you'll learn them after a few runs and it will become automatic.
---
Currently blizzard could never pull that off. They will never make an mmo half as great as classic.
---
Code reviews are not magic and they don't catch everything.
---
I should specify that I don’t want it to instantly teleport you into the dungeon like in retail, just find a group where nobody is doing bullshit reserving, but there’s nothing “social” about the aids that is LFG and world chat right now.
---
Who even reads anything on reddit except the title lmfao.
---
Top 1 worldwide has 400 dps.
---
Top 100 has 250 dps.
---
It is not pretty. They all have sulfuras
---
It's literally 1/6 of the day, not 1/4.
---
Ye just try it out on different times, when nothing helps take the portal to dalaran.
---
Ultra expensive to craft and not really good
---
Easiest: Rogue &amp; Mage.
---
Both are also pretty strong.
---
Still bottom DPS lmao
---
I went back for the archeage unchained launch and there were a lot of posts similar to yours here. People in that game that are dominating have been playing the original launch for 5 years now and the new players are confused and being left behind. It can be difficult but everyone started from scratch, just some like 13 years ago. The people that are impatient during dungeons are either A) used to retail where you can pull several groups, or B) watching streamers with their A team groups doing multi group pulls and thinking that is the norm. I remember doing wailing caverns first week of classic launch. Christ that was a wake up call for a lot of people that this isn’t the same game as retail
---
Paladins have command procs to make use of the high dmg. Same as windfury I suppose
---
Interrupt on cooldown IMO. Doesn't matter what spell. Shaman only have one casted school in Classic. (They have fire and frost spells, but only shocks and totems, which can't be interrupted.) You lock them out of most of their damage and all of their healing with every interrupt.
---
Ya rogues trying to steal your gold and your heart
---
It doesn't bring anything positive from your point of view, not everyone is playing a game because "oh my god it's immersive" or "oh the world is so meaningful" get over the fact that some people simply don't care about these aspects of the game and deal with it. I'm playing to WoW (particularly TBC) because I like the gameplay, not because I feel like the world is huge and immersive, I don't care in any way about that
---
I like ambush way better as an opener vs mages.
---
It has. They're IS a lot of situational spells in classic. Combined with engineer feels flavorful you have to know what your opponent IS able to do and how you Can counter it. In détail everything IS streamlined, every class has a huge burst a CC a self heal etc so you just need to learn how to not waste your ressources and engage them at the right time but that's pretty much it.
---
I’m still doing that on rogue. Should I not be?
---
Where does the quest chain start?
---
Yeah I mostly rolled here thinking the world PvP would be fun here with the streamers, but it’s actually worse. Most just roll in giant raids lol.
---
I’d rather not.
---
Classic has item restoration though. You can see all characters in there. Dunno if you need a sub to access it though
---
Spinal Reaper, 2h axe
---
Ayy a quest both my chars can skip

You clearly have no idea what you're talking about

YOU ARE NOW ENTERING...
---
It's almost unfair how strong mages are compared to rogues. I know I know a good rogue can beat a mage, but you'll have to do exceptional shit. You don't have to do exceptional shit as a mage to kill a rogue. Just the usual stuff. We gotta abuse spellbatching to get the gouge on the blinks, skull of impending doom to counter sheeps, improved sprint to counter a nova, and maybe a pvp trinket and a Ice Reflector. 
---
Like last week I was attacked by a mage, and I didn't have cooldowns. He killed me with exclusively instant cast spells, and it took him like 10 seconds tops.

You can buy a legit key for &lt;20$ online.

I understand your point of view. My guild will be using consumables either way, they all enjoy min-maxing. I was just thinking if there is any certain consumables that aren't the "regular" obvious ones to bring ontop of the regular package
---
Nearly all Warrior abilities can be used while moving.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. Inexact numbers and timespans are not indicative of a confirmed bug. Post some screenshots.

It's not a unpopular opinion. See how Many upvoted front page " Am I a Dick for reserving" post there are.
---
Sword &gt; Axe.
---
BRE is the best coordinated PvP weapon until the end of classic.
---
Not confirmed at all. Just alleged.
---
Doesn't matter unless you have a talent for that weapon type then it'd benefit you to get the extra bonuses for that type of weapon. Some races have skill bonus to consider too. So an orc would benefit from 2 axes more then mix matching

HoTw/Ns is still very viable when pushing meters. It’s just very gear dependent. I’m sitting on 7/8 T1 and mixing in mana potions/Arcane elixir and some food I’m still able to be in the Top 5 along with a fellow Druid who is playing moon glow spec.
---
It’s nice having that massive mana pool and using lower ranked healing touches as you can beat other healers just by out lasting then in the fight. 
---
At the end of the day though, I would consider playing around with your spec and finding what you enjoy most.
---
I have it. Sometimes it proccs 3 times in a row.  
---
There's barely I fight I don't have 1 procc atleast.
---
It can

Alliance on incendius. Great server

Presuming he couldn't spend the time doing more productive things until BGs come out
---
Horde like the pppppppppppvp type of combat
---
2.7k hp? He deserves to die in one shot
---
I'm not playing to classic, I wouldn't even play to classic if you paid me 15€/h to do so.
---
I know that what I hate about vanilla it what a lot of people like and as you pointed out the opposite is also true, I like flying mounts and hate world PvP but a lot of people have opposite opinions.
---
I was just pointing out that people have different opinions on what's good or bad in vanilla, I don't like unwanted interactions so for me flying mounts is a big yes as it avoids all the things that can happen on the ground.
---
If you think that QoL stuff from TBC killed the online interactions in the game (flying mounts / summoning stones) are bad it's your opinion but it's not a fact, I don't want to interact with most of players, no thanks
---
We have had 2 BREs &amp; 1 OEB so far. No SR no HoR  unfortunately.
---
You're perfectly capable of tanking dungeons as Ele/Resto. Really good single target threat. NS for an emergency heal. Self heals give you AoE threat too.
---
Toughness, Anticipation and Parry (the only "tanking" talents Shaman have) are pretty weak anyway. You can live without them. Threat is a lot more important in dungeons than mitigation.
---
Jandice drops the shoulders?
---
Yeah, but it's not like it was in WotLK where every crafting profession had some kind of permanent bonus.
---
Yeah it's a bunch of assumptions based on incomplete information with no screenshots to confirm it. OP needs to stop spreading this as fact until he/she has shared even a shred of evidence.
---
earthfury gnna become a ghost town
---
I can say the same thing about vanilla, I didn't play much but there are things that are a big no for me.
---
Yeah TBC should totally stay rotting on private servers, vanilla's gameplay is insanely good, a lot of skill needed etc, we don't need anything else.
---
Its not efficient and all people seem to forget DRs.
---
Same here.  My first few runs it seemed like every run dropped 4 or 5.  Then I didn't run it for a couple of weeks and I've seen one orb per run ever since.
---
Off tanks need to actually tank sometimes. You bring a Shaman for your full-time Nightfall user and also give your off tanks Nightfall to help improve uptime.
---
I second that, if you go this route watch a good mage stream or party with a lot of mages and really pay attention to who gets it done and who doesnt
---
BRE proccs all the time, 1 procc and you already do more damage then HoR. It can procc 3 times in a single hit (which it often does).
---
I kill basically all HoR wearers on my server in PvP because I crit them for 1.8k with an MS.
---
true
---
This. I feel like the sound when you hit, the numbers (without addons) being bigger + the sound that comes with it, is just a lot more satisfying. Especially when you get a crit and you hear the extra loud slice sound if you have an axe or sword. On retail, autoattacks are almost unnoticable bencause of the smaller number font and the sounds not being able to be heard because all other abilities that you constantly press are so loud.
---
We both have really good gear
---
Why is that ? They are growing at the moment.
---
Ill ding today! :) im excited af
---
I mean you could smell that coming back when classic was announced.
---
Honestly cannot remember where it was said but it's been decided a long time ago, probably mentioned at blizzcon 2018. They definitely did say that BG's will be cross realm and since I haven't seen any mention of it being only realm wide from the 10th of december I'd assume their original statement is still valid.
---
Edit: Not the source I originally saw it on but it's definitely valid: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090136/world-of-warcraft-classic-faq-what-you-need-to-know
---
It's the element of surprise. I've charged Ony-geared mages that ignored me at first only to realize at the last second that all their shields were purged and they were suddenly 20% health before they recovered.
---
Plus those guaranteed chain crits for 200% damage every 3 minutes is amazeballs for mass TM zergs. You can stack +Nature or Spellpower and as long as the target doesn't outright resist, you will hit 60s **hard**. 
---
But surprise is they key, then burst. If you die, they get nothing. But if they die it's hilarious and juicy honor.
---
One guy came to me and was like, I only have 8s, will that get me to TB? and I was like, it's fine dude. and then portaled him to TB, and then Uc.  he was super grateful and I wish someone was like that when I was levelling so it's nice to help once in a while.
---
I just kill anyone I see, beside the occasional mages because they are impossible to kill as rogue (I don't have a dagger to one-shot them).
---
I also did that pre-honor system, and one of the reason I believe as to why people are so upset now that P2 is out, is because these people who are now forced to engage in PvP were formerly  the biggest layer exploiters.
---
On the servers I played there was more or less always this much this much wPvP, the difference was that people were constantly spamming world and g chat for layer invites so they could get out as soon as they were gankd once. Now they can't.
---
Please tell me that man got his bindings!!!
---
Well you're not supposed to watch arenas, you're supposed to play arenas, and yes it is matchup dependent but there is always a way to win
---
imagine picking that server
---
truth hurts :(
---
⁸~kcy yl::😉😉😉😉😉
---
Im sorry about your life experiences and i wish only best to your mom but... whats the point of this post? You leave okay but you wont make me feel bad if i gank you anytime. Its just a game. If you dont like part of it and neither dont wanna reroll on PvE where such stuff doesnt exist then... well.... enjoy other games or focus more on taking care of your mom, consider getting therapy animal, some hobbies as you end in job quite early (relaxing ones considering you explain your job exhausts you) and have fun in life.
---
The ingame community is absolutely amazing and I had like 3-4 bad experiences in total. But this sub is just trash and everyone is complaining about BiS for some reason, horde or alliance, toxicity, lagg or whatever.
---
On the right panel, under "Join subreddit" there should be your name and (edit) button. This will allow you to set flair for this sub.
---
BM hunter is basically 
---
/cast bestial wrath
---
/attack with pet
---
Done.
---
Paladin is a class. Ret is a spec. People pick classes to play. Ret Pally happens to be one of the best support classes in the game.
---
garrote would be better option to be honest. The silence is brutal. It means they have to iceblock immediately, or die.
---
just going from https://wowclassicpopulation.com/ data. we seem to be 60/40 to the horde at 60. given our total pop that's close to 1K extra horde.
---
Yeah, I hate Hillsbrad map because of this unopened parts.
---
Profits&gt;everything
---
Looks like the relevant settings would be under `Widgets` &gt; `Auras`. Use `/tptp` to open up the settings.
---
Most people leveling as elemental after 40 seem to be running around in cloth. Can you stick to mail and still be semi-effective or are you gimping yourself too much due to lack of +spellpower etc. on gear?
---
I'm level 48 considering switching from enhance but don't like the thought of becoming super squishy, especially for WPVP.
---
That quest chain will give you enough gold for at least 3 Traveler's Backpacks if you're 60.
---
Well.. when it comes to orbs, everyone need (or greed) them equally so there's no reason for everyone to greed instead, it just opens up the possibility for someone to ninja loot. Alchemy recipes etc, that's another story
---
It only show nodes that you mined, though.
---
Whenever I log in all my Macros just show up with a '?' icon.
---
I can type /reload to fix them, but thats a bit of a pain as it takes a whlie, clears chat history, etc.
---
Anyone know of a more permanent solution?
---
If you read up above, he had 400+ and then had to re install the add on or something
---
You're gonna be waiting a while friend... unless you're on a PVE server.
---
inb4 Squirting\_Nachos found dead from 5 self-inflicted shotgun blasts to the back of his head
---
it's like not even 0,01% dps increase?
---
I tap like five times in a raggi fight, most of the time when I'm moving back into position anyway so I couldn't use the gcd for bolt
---
Bye?
---
All classes are viable at 49 but top three imo warlock, shad priest, Hunter.
---
It's part of the longest quest chain in WoW - assembling Scepter of Shifting Sands.  
---
It should be here in Phase 4 with AQ20 and AQ40.
---
And that's why I like LFG / LFR, sadly it isn't on TBC.
---
TBC and wrath are more accessible not because they're easier but because they don't require you to have no life to play, in my opinion that's not a healthy kind of "accessive".
---
I agree that they haven't do well in the long run, but there was no good server that managed to don't screw up themselves with stupid things (like warman selling WG and T6.5 on their shop)
---
Warmane had the same pop as their wrath server when people were playing on it.
---
I didn't look for some time but I don't think that there are a lot of high pop private servers nowadays anyway, private server scene is slowly dying if you compare with how much server there was and how populated they were 12 years ago.
---
Bad news is levelling will indeed slow down, good news is you get to see ZF now! Zul Farrak is one of my favorite dungeons. And yes Mara and Ulda are both cool too.
---
I use lifetap maybe 5 times in a mc bossfight and 4/5 of those times when I'm moving back into position and the gcd would do nothing therwise
---
You're not wrong. Take it for what it is though, two guys messing around outside org not serious high level PvP competition
---
Ah yes set pieces that we never wear
---
I'm talking about people going for top world rankings on logs, applies to a very small percentage of players
---
Maybe you are? Shamans are no joke.
---
Idk why I thought it was a fourth, but should be a fifth anyway as op had a typo of 7 instead of 8
---
Get ready to get camped :-(
---
No it disappeared after I logged off
---
Hey mate, I am a fellow enchanter. I am not so much code-savvy in lua but, I'd like to check your addon if possible and maybe help you a bit.
---
Just like a rogue to stick it's mouth inside someone's ass while they're smelling flowers.
---
Kek.
---
Get a group. If the trinket drop you will do a 100g roll giveaway. That should get you some people
---
It's a bug. Happened to me. Should fix later in the day.
---
Well then you could just create alts on grief raids so that higher lvls would get punished for killing you if they try fighting back.
---
Easy until you fight anyone who knows what a deadzone is
---
my 60 is a generous god and showers my alts with nice things
---
You can see a naked rogue jump around you while he kills you... in VR!
---
Just ding already, no man should suffer mountless.
---
Yeah... That must be nice.
---
1-20 is a joke.
---
You can make OP weapons like +5 to 1h, +100 hp to chest, +9 stam to bracer, run speed to boots, and crush through 1-20 in a handful of hours.
---
oh i got it, and my next character coming up is a war, half dreading the hoj grind half debating if i should try for sgc too
---
truth
---
Why would you play UD when your PvP trinket removes fears but not stuns?
---
I play healing priest (currently disc, uncertain if that stays the same for BWL). Thank you!!
---
This is right. And i would recommend using warrior in dps spec, find a shaman healer (windfury) and 2 other random. Blast through instances. If you play in EU, I would love to join on a new alt. Hehe
---
hahahaha that’s hilariously fascinating
---
the people will upvote the content they want
---
I wish I saw this earlier so I wouldn’t have wasted my hearth. :’(
---
Blizzard arena realms were for tournament qualifiers only. The private scene arena tournament was actually quite successful his project lasted quite a few years, which had more than enough interest to sustain it. I don't think blizz will release arena only realms, just saying that there is some interest. Enough to be profitable? No probably not, but if they polish retail then arena will be good again.
---
I just went through this part of leveling my rogue just hit 56 was 51 when P2 started. Definitely do Mara quest for thrash blade it will help tremendously as rogues are fairly weapon dependent. 
---
I spent up until 52 in Mara or ZF you can do these up to 55 honestly but the do gain won’t be there. Then hop over to BRD to start trying to acquire HOJ and a few other items. BRD arena/anger runs will help as well.
---
If you are solo leveling I always farmed down as I found that easier than farming at same level and as you said having to eat after every pull. I hit turtles on coast of tanaris and elementals on coast of feralas regularly as those areas don’t have roaming death squads... your going to be in a tough spot on a pvp server unless you are in the dominant faction
---
I know it's SFK, but it still reminds me of Kara a bit.
---
Miss that place.
---
Im also on EU Earthshaker. It depends, big zones for PVP such as BRM for BRD, eastern plaguelands and western plaguelands are being camped all the time, both from alliance but mostly horde. Rogues are everywhere as you'd expect. Other from that its pretty much the same as every server, you kind of have to spam dungeons to lvl.
---
but on the real for your first character with no outside help even if you don't have ur mount at exactly 40 the gold gain really scales up quick with quest rewards and green drops adding up a lot, and you'll likely be able to get it in the next level or two
---
Every class has infinite resources, infinite self heals and infinite mobility. Just cause every class is godmode doesnt mean the game has more depth. Not to mention things like Engineering and consumables in Classic which add depth beyond the class you chose.
---
If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.
---
if you are rogue you should open with cheap shot
---
I'd settle for 1/10 as good as BC.
---
On the other hand if you just FAP and sprint there’s not much the mage can do. If you interrupt the poly it’s usually GG
---
I got it at 40. I just stopped 5 lvls prior to grind the ah.
---
Yea, them warriors pushing 600DPS with white hits. I don't like it.
---
That moment when you think getting raped over and over again is the PvP experience
---
&gt; had a friend that would sap lowbies multiple times in a row in Redridge once he hit 60, and he would leave some people completely frozen for up to an hour. Just sapping, and sapping, and then occasionally blinding, then gouging, and if they got away he’d just kill them and corpse camp. Needless to sa
---
"literally"....
---
It's not bad... but by taking the eye, you basically commit to spending 5000g+ on materials for a weapon that is outclassed in PvM and PvP by Bonereaver's Edge.  
---
Bonereavers also doesn't make you a giant orange target.  Everyone wants to kill the guy with the legendary weapon.
---
Hard pass on that.  Though I'm wondering if D4 will be closer to D3 or D2.
---
Some hope for blizzard if they go back to D2, that would give me hope for WoW to eventually improve.
---
Isn’t it mostly chain heal spams / healing wave on tank spam? I don’t doubt that it’s somehow fun tho, just wondering why - sham will be my 2nd alt.
---
I’m honestly not sure if this dev team is absolutely horrible or just horribly understaffed. I’m sure it’s the latter but there are so many no brainer things they could have done differently not to mention glaring game breaker bugs that were straight up ignored.
---
your excuses are as pathetic as blizzard's quality assurance
---
Im horde on blaumeux and it seems fairly even. Alliance tend to hold more control of wpvp late evening-early morning and the horde does the rest of the day. That being said ive been a part of battles at various times where alliance kick our butts or vice versa. Cool realm so far :)
---
Couple of loots? You get like 30 items from an MC run not counting BOE's
---
Grid2 and ShadowedUnitFrames - I use both actually.
---
If you are haling, you might use Healbot as well.
---
Fantastic, makes it easy.
---
So be aware some fights are going to be INCREDIBLY intense. (Chromag + Nef)
---
Chromag is a very dispel heavy fight which is incredibly LONG because of the number of times everyone has to "hide" to prevent themselves from getting CCed by chromag. On top of this, he is hitting the raid with a number of debuffs which have to be dispelled. (If you get all of them, you get turned into a drakanoid and wipe the raid pretty much)
---
Nef on the other hand is just a long fight. The phases are long, and you have to be aware of the priest call, where you stop healing and cannot renew the tank even. (It will cause damage instead of healing them)
---
The fight will last 10-20 MINUTES. So yeah good times.
---
Elixirs of spirit/int or flask of wisdom, are things you can look at.
---
Just because you can put it on high doesn’t mean you want to put it on high
---
Is it hard to cheap shot without breaking sap?
---
Yea and those players can go play retail?
---
And then the fire nation attacked..
---
YES. Us asia players are FUCKED. You need to put a bug report in ASAP and haunt blizzard, they are trying to  ignore the problem because in reality it means and and all PVP scores cant be trusted
---
Do you actually get more honour from killing higher level targets tho?
---
I found several differences between healing logs and meters weeks ago tbh. And some guildies have some problems too i thin, iirc one of our tank has the majority of his abilities straight up not showing.
---
Warlock is way easier
---
can't argue with the truth
---
True but it’s not bis though. It’s third bis.
---
Powershifting? Do you mean regular shifting?
---
Meh nostalgia only lasted so long for me. I just don’t live the same unhealthy live style as my younger days.
---
I see, you are one of those trolls on reddit just trying to annoy others.
---
Yikes. How is that entertaining for him?
---
Yeah man , you roll on this wep as a warrior then.  Spend 6k on the mats to make it, plus guild help for ingots, and then get a bre next raid for free - whups.
---
Always have them on max... unless you’re a herbalist.
---
I see a lot of new mages sheep damaged players, healing them in the process, not knowing how to properly kite and eventually getting caught, dying in two hits. 
---
warlocks can facetank with ease, draintank while letting their dots do the work, they can just run around while doing almost full damage, have several pets do attack for them and in the case of then using a voidwalker, sacrifice him for a big bubble. Not to mention fear, even an instant fear that is a single target nuke that heals you. You can ress yourself, basically never oom, and have health stones, which is a free health potion if your already perverted self heal isn't enough.
---
Mate, you're objectively wrong. If you followed r/wowservers for example, netherwind did regular updates for years where they fixed TBC bugs. Like it's not up for argument, you're simply wrong.
---
BRE is *way* better
---
Because in PVE it reduces your chance to miss a boss enemy. There are two hit equations, one for targets whose defense is &gt;10 skill points higher than your weapon skill, and one for targets for whose defense is  ≤ 10 skill points. By picking up that first 5 points, you reduce your chance to miss from 8% to 6%, and eliminate the hidden 1% miss that is baked in to fighting a boss. The first 5 weapon skill is effectively 3% hit chance.
---
Past the first 5 weapon skill the reduction in hit rating is greatly diminished. Picking up the extra +8 weapon skill on OEB as a human only reduces your chance to miss from 6% to 5.2%. 
---
There has been discussion about it decreasing either the frequency of glancing blows, or the damage reduction of them. It's possible this is true but I haven't gone to any effort to test it with different gear sets. Maybe when the next Vendorstrike drops.
---
OEB is still a nearly perfect weapon and easily the best pre-Rag weapon. They're saying it's the best PVE weapon probably because you need to pick up 3% hit as a non-human if you upgrade to OEB... I don't think that's onerous (mask/lionheart, truestrike shoulders, battleborn armbraces, brigam/onslaught girdle, bloodmail boots, devilsaur set is a natural 9% hit) so without seeing a sim proving otherwise I'd disagree. Worth mentioning Spinal Reaper is the equivalent of OEB for Orcs in PVE.
---
The wonder of our world.  An adventure beckons.
---
That can't be the case. Windfury resetting the swing timer sucks, but every attack has a 20% chance to proc it and it does a normal hit's worth of damage and generates rage, allowing you to use every spare global cooldown to fish for it with hamstring. There is no way all that totals to 8%.
---
Maybe if you remove the showtooltip and simply select the image from the list though IDK
---
There is no aggro wipe in p3. Your off tank should be in the middle til the top of the threat meter in p1. The higher your raid dps in p2, the further to the top he should be. The reason being that the fireballs she casts in p2 reset aggro and are cast on the #1 on aggro list. The it's important that your OT doesn't get hit. When she is at 41% or 40% or OT should start dealing dmg (it's a good idea to use recklessness here) and hope that he gets to the top of the threat meter. All DPS should use feign death/vanish or other threat reducing means now (limited invul. potion for example).
---
Yep, yesterday some gnome rogue opened on me and I was thinking: "lol ez" then the guy used vanish, imp sprint, escape artist, cb, blind and prep, he killed me. I ress up and am like, now you're in trouble, but then he pops a FAP with sprint, kicks my poly and I got embarrassed again. Needless to say there was no third time, I guess the guy just knew he had nothing left and didn't bother, which is the smart thing.
---
Gnome racial removes CC and it's *by far* thé best racial for the most dominant comp in the game (druid warrior). It's also on a shorter cd than WotF.
---
Smolderforge was an instant 70 pvp server, but whenever I went on there most people just ran battlegrounds. I was more talking about AT before it went down, where actual top players played. On casual servers like SF, I'm sure you're right about the faction imbalance.
---
how is 2-3 hours a week for MC and onyxia a second job? dont even need consumables either
---
Right now everything is hand crafted for my needs, I don't think this addon can be used by everyone, in any case you can check how it works in case you want ideas, I'm in golemagg horde
---
Sure you can justify it any way you want, but the truth is back in Vanilla, BC and Wrath people greeded on all the shit and if you went around needing on stuff because you need the gold you would be called a ninja. I guess times change. Notice how smug it sounds when justifying this shit, the system it's fucking clear, it's why you hace 3 options: Need if you're going to equip it or use it, Greed if you just want to sell it and PASS which is also an option. It's pretty fucking clear, if everyone needed why don't we have only 2 options? Need or Pass, don't we all need the gold?
---
It be more like : oh shit a rogue 10 lvl higher than me just stun me, I guess I'm dead already.
---
Thanks, this is a great collection.
---
AT is no longer up, but it was fairly balanced while it was. This is the biggest TBC server up right now:
---
https://armory.warmane.com/ladder/2v2/Outland
---
And as you can tell, Alliance is about 60/40 vs horde (much thanks to their amazing racials).
---
I see you’re on the ~~Herod~~ the Alliance as well*
---
It does though - for warriors specifically.
---
On horde it should go to an enc sham as prio since it’s bis for them.  On alliance, obviously give it to someone that needs the upgrade but be aware that it’s 6k to make the fucker and it’s not BiS so it kinda becomes a bank sitting weapon at some point.
---
Nah, I'm right &amp; you're lying:
---
Alliance is more than 60/40, much thanks to their superior racials.
---
Sad story, especially considering that the LBRS spider is easy to solo as a drood (I farmed him back then), sneak next to him in stealth and kill him with: sleep, damage spell, sleep, etc...
---
i am trolling you but i'm also right
---
This post is talking about drop rates, not loot rules?
---
ok
---
True true. Stay strong brother.
---
Peter Jackson will fuck this one up. Leeroy Jenkins woul do a way better job directing.
---
Alliance mentality is more flawed towards "if we complain loud enough then we can make blizzard to implement changes we want to".
---
Yeah it's pretty sad to be honest. I wonder if it stems from MOBA game culture.
---
Eh they won't give a shit lets be honest. 2019 blizzard
---
I mean there’s 4 chances to get oeb per raid, and then another chance to get bre too.  Yes you can get bad luck but honestly your warriors should have at least an oeb reasonably quickly.
---
We’ve had 4 drop in one run before even.
---
You get more than from killing players your level. At 47, killing another 47 solo is ~100 honor. Whereas a 60 kill is 250+. The caveat is it takes more honor to get RP for ranks the lower your level is. 
---
They do this so you don't have level 19 twink Generals. This means that hitting officer ranks as less than 60 takes more honor.
---
We appreciate you taking the time to flag this as an underrated comment.
---
However, this appears to be in error and the comment is already rated according to its quality.
---
Yes, if you respec into the same thing, you keep the ranks.
---
If you respec to something else, and then respec back again, you need to buy the ranks again.
---
&gt;Yeah it's a bunch of assumptions
---
An assumption implies these people guessed their HK's didn't get accounted for, that's different from killing someone, seeing that your honor is calculated, and then looking in your honor page and seeing that it wasn't accounted for.
---
There are a ton of anecdotes saying they've been noticing the same exact thing, You're saying it's a coincidence that all these people just happen to be lying for what reason exactly? To get blizzard to check and see that the code is fine? That makes no sense.
---
&gt;with no screenshots to confirm it.
---
Why and how would you screenshot that proving that it isn't being accounted for? Most players already have logged HK's on their character, so if they screenshotted an honor chat log with the honor panel that would look ordinary because of the already existing kills.
---
Noggenfogger and dominated by horde
---
Honestly think most of them gave up, last 3 days allys been dominating most of the zones, only problem are hordes camping menathil but theres other ways to solve that problem.
---
Farm on off hours and wpvp on peak hours
---
Big difference between playing efficiently and being able to play 18 hours a day for months to get rank 14.
---
Plenty of people with jobs and families still want to min max.
---
The most important fact supporting this theory is horde players somehow are unable to whine on reddit as much as alliance players.
---
Yeah, at this point I just do the Gandhi approach and make them kill me while sitting through it. The last I'll give them is the satisfaction of the gank!
---
OP isn't talking about loot rules, he's referencing the apparent difference in drop frequency from an old forum post.
---
It's a meme weapon. Nothing more.
---
you do window jump and doesn't need to skip ;)
---
i'm sure it's a stop attack macro
---
On our server, the more populated faction have even set up fp catch groups that abuse dueling mechanics to force-remove honorless from the target
---
I leveled in Shadow Hold in Felwood for a while, pretty decent mining in the depths. There are some holes you can hide in but they're tricky to find and you need to want to grind.
---
It's not affecting all players equally then. I can ONLY play during those hours and I had 50k honour last week and am currently on track for 75k+ this week. All between 4-8am ST.
---
This is exactly the kind of bug that's never gonna be caught by QC. Nobody has played the game during those hours before beta, testers or not. And it's not like honor was enabled then. QC are more focused on bears trapped in trees, players falling through the ground or getting stuck on loading screens.
---
A classic case of throwing to toys from the pram
---
Came here to say this. This isn't your main tank at all, he can't have any of these items. This is just a dude in T3.

Weebs will upvote anything if it says the words JoJo &gt;.&gt;

there are plenty of frustrations, just like all classes

Said the lvl 60 with his raid of lvl 60 masturbating himself and his friends about how good he is while camping lowbies.
---
I love reading bad faith comments.
---
I've always been interested in learning digital art, but then I see how amazing this is and my soul gets crushed lol. Amazing stuff!
---
summon is exactly lvl 20 ;)
---
Yep
---
LITERALLY HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN
---
He's an asshole so he enjoys asshole stuff.
---
Yeah it is. In interface options there's an option to show procs on abilities under combat text. There's also a simple add-on that will light up the button to press. I suggest using an overpower macro that switches stance for you and use overpower.
---
I see. How much did they reduce the droprates by? I saw 6 drop once and we didn't even do Cannonmaster either. Our tank who reserved them went through the roof lol
---
Jezus christ, did you at least get paid to post this garbage?
---
You just had to be that salty and sweaty guy, huh?
---
at least they did not have to do the tedious corpse running all the time
---
Congratulations man!
---
Do they no longer have exploding engi stuff? Last time I played around cata-mop, rocket boots (or was it a belt upgrae) still had a good chance to fail, I remember using them on h.rag and hoping they won't fuck it up.
---
It's actually hilarious how auto attack font is so small you have to actually look for them or they'll pass unnoticed between the HUGE abilty damage numbers , most of the time they are so small you hardly see what the actual numbers were
---
Mine deserted me after they hit mid 40s. Stating, “this shit is to much of a grind...”
---
They have returned to retail to grind AP.....
---
The bonus int is nice, but you're a druid and going to be basically in full epics from whatever the most recent raid is 2 weeks in because there're so few druids. Basically, who cares dude just wear the archivist cloak.
---
Personally I'd wear it just because it's such a stupid drop. I have the bracers from BRD and I constant get whispers and guildies asking how many runs it took. The amount of hate I've gotten from guildies because it was my 2nd incendius kill.
---
It only buffs people in your group. The boomkin still has to do ~80-85% of the damage of a mage to be equal, and in most scenarios in lategame, they won't be able to do even 30%. Mages scale hard, moonkins don't.
---
Mystical Orb of Shadow Wrath can roll up to +21 shadow damage
---
Every one of us can run it on high, but we just dont. Theres a button in the options for "Classic mode" most of us use that to see the game as it was at the time.
---
Not like it adds much anyway. Some more grass, shadows/lighting and water that looks like liquid metal. lol.
---
Sure. Doesn't mean I think it's as enjoyable.
---
Fun fact: Spinal Reaper is bis for orcs, not Hand of Ragnaros. 😋
---
Good guilds acknowledge the game is easy and what makes them good is their ability to complete content with non-conventional stuff.
---
you're not the only one

---
Sure not everyone wants to heal but let’s look at the facts here.  Yes the utility brought by a ret or holy paladin is roughly the same, however one of these also comes with the best healing class in the game and the other comes with worse-than-tank damage.
---
I’m not saying you shouldn’t play what you want, I’m just saying that a holy pally is far superior as support than a ret.
---
I like to do sap cs with walkaway into garrote evis reset and repeat. Not 1 mage has lived so far.
---
Here's another plan: when there's some massive wpvp going on somewhere, just walk in there as a level 10 character. The other faction won't like that dishonorable kill
---
^
---
Even a +20 is better though.
---
imagine needing innervate in 2019...
---
I wandered in there running from 4 wolfs. That was day 2 of classic 🤣
---
It's impossible to tell the difference from a glance between a warrior, ret pally, rogue and hunter nowadays.
---
I read this in Jimmy's voice...
---
If the wep was a normal drop I’d agree with you that 2nd or 3rd bis is still good.  But the key thing here is that it needs insane mats to make the fucker - you’re looking at 6k minimum.  Check out the mats on making it and tell me it’s worthwhile for a non-bis wep.
---
The quest offhand has +20 damage and healing, how is +20 shadow damage better?
---
I recall this as well, it was like 3ish months before TBC that they did city queuing.
---
For PvE, and 2h, are slamspec where it's at or basic fury rotation?
---
&gt;OP is probably from America. Unless you're trying to become the best doctor of your class, college is easy as hell there. Easier than highschool in most European countries it seems.

---
I have no idea the extent of the nerf, but seeing 6 (even when you *do* the cannon boss) is definitely an outlier situation. Standard runs usually see somewhere between 0-3. It is completely normal to not see one at all.
---
Stop whining.
---
At 60?  Hell yeah!  The quest chain pay out lots of coin. 
---
I partied with a friend and was able to get 650gold from EPL quests alone. 
---
The linked in quest gave 7g and some change after turn in (did it at cap).
---
just wait til we cruuuuuuush BGs lol
---
i mean i meant to make a joke but it looks like it right over your head
---
There were private servers where this was possible and I'm pretty sure MS and Bloodthirst (not lust) always shared a cooldown there.
---
Ofcourse, I'm just saying stranger things have happened :)
---
Depends on the cost and class/spec. 
---
As a prot warrior main, I depend on the dos of others to kill things efficiently 🤣
---
I kinda figured but I wasn't sure that would work so fluidly. Thanks for answering
---
LOL ok so go ahead and look at rogue pre-bis, which absolutely does NOT take thaty into account. Same for warrior dps. You are 100% dead wrong.
---
If you don't CS a mage they will just walk away from you, And once you get to them they will still have blink.
---
Dark pact affliction for leveling.  Shadow mastery / ruin at 60.
---
Definitely this. Also happened to one of our friends.
---
That’s all the alliance players logging off their alts onto their 60’s to return the gank 3 fold
---
&gt;  there is a spherical areatrigger at the entrance to that room, which has this script hooked up to it.
---
I wonder if it works if a mage blinks thru it, or someone gets summoned thru it by warlock standing nearby
---
Because even 1 proc is enough to make it better.  Armor reduction scales extremely well.
---
Yes. 
---
You picked Horde, now get in line with everyone else who picked easy mode.
---
&gt;Sure not everyone wants to heal but let’s look at the facts here. Yes the utility brought by a ret or holy paladin is roughly the same, however one of these also comes with the best healing class in the game 
---
Yes, nobody is denying that fact. Shamans are the same boat. 
---
&gt;and the other comes with worse-than-tank damage.
---
Like I said, Ret Paladins shine in PvP. Their damage is mediocre in PvE. That doesn't stop raids from inviting Paladins just for their buffs. If you've done MC/Ony or any content at 60 since Classic launch, Shamans and Paladins have been getting invites regardless of their specialization. Just play with normal players instead of the cancerous private server crowd that tries to min/max in a 15 year old game. 
---
I seriously hope you don't think Ret Pallies just put all their points in the Ret tree. They're usually a mixture of Ret/Prot and some Holy.
---
Comments above are accurate but if that gets to complex, we just drop damage entirely for the transition from phase 2 to 3 and let the tank grab aggro back (usually the mt, sometimes ot really depending on who picks up first) and usually have no problems. I lead pug groups on her and we always kill her either first or second shot
---
Horde bad alliance good
---
i love doing this
---
stand still and /laugh
---
actually had the same rogue gank me twice, i pull this manouver, he just /pat-s and walks away both times.
---
it's shit like this that makes me love this game.
---
Our hand of rag went to a rest pala too. I’ve honestly seen more Pallas with it than any other class.
---
its not actually vanilla in its current state anyways. its garbage
---
*Don't make me get my main*
---
This is exactly my story. I thought it was just a visual bug, but then was more worried when I noticed they didn't show up days later. I PvPed a lot last week during all hours, so didn't notice it as much, but my friend who I PvP with only during hours from about 3:30 am - 9 am server time barely hit rank 2 despite having lots of duo HKs with me. Now I feel convinced he just didn't get credit for all of those kills last week either so I'm not hopeful for this week. I just hope somehow the data was captured and can be fixed retroactively, but not sure that will be the case.
---
use enchancement, elemental will require u to change all ur gear for a slight advantage in speed... slight advantage
---
Whenever I see an alliance on Stalagg I’m shocked
---
Sounds like you're just unlucky. As long as you have that necklace thing in your bag for the eko, you can get that. You dont even need to do a quest for the firewater and you can get both in 1 drop from the same mob.
---
Any information about Ten Storms?
---
I sure as hell won't be still playing lol, good luck though
---
Until theres classic+ or tbc.
---
MoM is better in uncoordinated PvP, but coordinated BRE will always win due to the proc.
---
Not even a game anymore.  Just a griefing simulator for the horde. Classic was fun while in p1. Maybe p3 will see a return of interest.
---
Is there another way to have acces to the guide up on www.vanilla-questing.me? since the site seems to be down since yesterday.
---
Won't stop the Horde deathballs circling low level areas 24/7
---
Mages are direct counter to rogues. Unless dead during stunlock the mage should win.
---
Oh I just started over on Herod so I’m lvl 10 lol but I’m excited to keep leveling. I stopped because I wanted BGs and didn’t want to deal with open world pvp
---
This is also a great answer. While priests have one of the highest skill ceiling, up there with the mage and rogue, shadow priests are stupidly strong and bring buffs, offheals and utility
---
Don't forget about either the procs of the weapons nor the weapon specialization in the talent tree, both of which are hot garbage for Hand of Ragnaros.
---
Depends on your race. 
---
If human, any combo of sword/mace is used for min/max your stats and use of racial. 
---
Orc you want axe. 
---
Any other, any combo is fine, most classes benefit from slow MH, fast OH. 
---
Also, stuff like proc based talents will push you in one direction. Rogue sword Proc will work OH if you use a sword.
---
30-38 in 3 days prime time pvp server. What's the words in looking for.... Git gud
---
Even with the stream fan boys and massive ques I love faerlina and wouldn’t change servers
---
Alright, sounds fun to farm for 2 hours just so I can respecc.
---
You beat me to list the ancient magics!!
---
One of the things wotlk done right was having samey sets while leveling, so it actually looked like a matching suit of armour. People said just being lazy but I thought it was clever
---
"Transfer aborted: instance not found"
---
That’s assuming it’s a PvP server
---
That doesn't work, there's an angle where melee abilities go through but attacks don't, which is what he's doing.
---
same. i quit weeks ago.
---
see you soon buddy! 19 orc hunter coming your way :3
---
What a waste of gear.
---
It’s certainly not a visual glitch.
---
And BWL, ZG, AQ, and Naxx will also have better offhands.. What's your point?
---
Jesus christ. I imagined dire maul would be impossible right now.
---
Thank god for scholomance. Only thing im doing as a level 58.
---
&gt; Am i supposed to play the same game over and over again 
---
Yes, that is the whole reason why private servers exist, so people can enjoy their favourite iteration of WoW for as long as they want, with no two-year expiration deadline like on Retail. 
---
And the same goes for Classic which grew out of this whole private server bussiness.
---
All I will say is that tank is probably the worst role to take as a new player, so I commend you on toughing it out.
---
no
---
I just want something new and fresh that so we can begin 1-60 again.
---
I am a rogue and opening boxes for free :-( fck greed
---
Ew
---
Imagine having to straight up make up stuff for people to argue with them; fact is that I never said it is BIS. Hell, I flat out said that it "is marginally worse". Thinking that non-BIS is meme just means you don't understand this game.
---
As for "for shamans", yeah, you really understand nothing here, not just PvE but PvP. Retail mentality needs to stay in retail.
---
It’s because “Shift + 1” is bound to Something else by default so it will ignore the key press.
---
Best thing I can tell you to do is open Key Bindings, unbind Shift + any number or letter that you see fit.
---
Now mod:control(ctrl) is by default bound to the pet bar.
---
You can also use two modifiers to prevent “fat fingering” Bloodlust, etc.
---
That being said, I often macro pet stuff into my normal spell macros to get around this.
---
And so it begins.
---
Art sub.

Tried going to BRD today. Got killed instantly when I finally got into BRM by honor farming hordes. Tried to get to BRD for 1h 30 mins. Gave up, left the group, tried to get back, had to get res sickness only to find horde camping thorium point, MC:ing anyone getting there, killing flight master and basically griefing, making the game unplayable as alliance. Couldn't res anywhere to HS and now I can't play the game. Hope you're having fun if you're horde. I'm not resubbing again, that's for sure. I don't mind getting ganked on a PvP server, but when your faction is at a disadvantage, just like in retail, and horde is literally griefing, preventing me from playing a game I'm paying an active subscription for to get 200 honor/hour, I don't see a point in playing. Basically I'm telling you, if you're horde, to fuck off.
---
Goblin only to reload. It has no cast time, but the bomb has a travel time to the target area b4 exploding.
---
Importantly, it's a true stun effect, not disorient like other common grenades.
---
That's the thing.
---
Just 1 boomkin, same as people talking about speed runs taking one.
---
Yes you take a single Boomkin but damn 1 boomkin in a raid means most of the people playing them wont be in a raid while every Warrior is welcome
---
It's a skill like anything else. The AH is like a mini game, and the more you play the better you get.
---
Browsing is what started me off. 
---
TSM add-on is good for QoL in many another areas too. I didn't get on with Auctioneer, but that might be personal. Try them. (TSM is great as it lets you go back to normal UI WHEN things get too much 😉).
---
Bank ALTs are key. Your main shouldn't AH if you're putting up posts like this. Take notes. Use the trick of getting your bank alt to L5, get enchanting and DE everything that doesn't sell. Who cares that it eventually sold for 25s if it cost you 28s in total to put it on the AH 14 times - I did this a few times 🤪.
---
Finally, you play the game so you know what the other AH users are looking for. What do you need? How important is it to you? What would you pay for it? You'll be surprised.
---
Best advice: look for stuff that a goblin is trying to control the price of and sell them all your stock at a nice price. Check out wow economy Reddit (I can't remember how to link them, if someone else could that would be grand).
---
Hope you get involved and become rich 😁
---
Yes the hell you do.
---
How are you spreading hots atm without massive overhealing?
---
At least you've come to terms with it 
---
=)
---
&gt;Roll pve and quit complaining.
---
Amen, such a stupid mindset to renain and cry on a message board that hardly anyone uses thinking it does anything. People are level 40 and refuse to reroll because of their "progress". Lmao.
---
no way i’d leave faerlina.  i can log in at 5 am and still find a group for almost anything.
---
Low levels don't give dishonorable kills.
---
Interestingly the original WoW manual described DKs as having that effect - killing lowbies would give DKs
---
I literally can't play my character as Alliance so I'm just gonna stop playing all together. Can't leve alts either, because once you step foot into a contested zone, there's horde ?? ganking you wherever you go. Game is literally unplayable as Alliance on PvP servers.
---
pls stop, ive already masturbated
---
A Warrior.
---
I'm horde and it's the same for me on my realm.
---
Been sitting at lvl 53 because I gave up and made an alt
---
Started playing with friends. They slowed down around 25. I then proceeded to get to 40 and then 50. They got to low 30s. I started a warrior. Caught up to them and all but 2 stopped playing. I continued grinding. Now the warrior is 50 and my main is 60.  However, my 2 remaining friends and I have 20s that we only play when each other are on. It works since I’ve got preraid BiS to grind and they’ve got 10ish levels till they start brd.
---
Frustrating if you're alliance. Horde is basically ezmode. Better leveling, more players, never have to worry about getting chain ganked in contested zones. World PvP is only fun for the majority faction.
---
Ah that's good but as a gnomish engineer there is no point me picking one up off the ah then!
---
This reminds me of FFXI. Samurais did 75% of their damage in chunky weapon skills and took 3-4 seconds between auto attacks, meanwhile Apocalypse-wielding Dark Knights would do 75% of their damage in auto attacks, and would mostly only use the Catastrophe weaponskill to refresh the Haste buff or when they needed health since it was actually a DPS loss since it reset your swing timer completely.
---
Mage. Pretty simple and easy, loads of damage, defence and utility, great nearly everywhere, but also with a high skill cap so you can improve.
---
Are there really that many of them? I could count the boomkins I have seen on my server with one hand, without using every finger.
---
Only world drop I’ve got was skull flame shield. A guildie rolled need to help my odds and ended up winning it. I gave him 150g and he gave it to me
---
Ah I didn't know that haha, kinda irrelevates my post then
---
I did that and they lost interest. It's confusing for the attacker. I also had to cancel my attack on a guy who just started jumping at the spot because this just felt wrong
---
You're supposed to hate horde in reddit mate.
---
Wheres this baby Yoda from first time seeing this lol
---
What's the point in playing ret if you're going to ignore all the +spellpower strength items that are literally itemised solely for your spec?
---
Do you just auto attack and renew a r1 SoC every 30s?
---
My guild cleared naxx like 50th, and we cleared it multiple times well before TBC. Definitely more than 30. 4 guilds did it on my server alone.
---
The investment to make it is huge, it is good but not the best (as in there are better weapons more easily available). It's a waste of resources as a guild effort, and an enormous investment to make alone. I think that qualifies as a meme
---
I cannot agree more.  And I'm on the "horde dominated" server. Took me an hour and a half to get into brd.  Right back to my alt.
---
Logs?
---
No it isn't, 7 SP would equate to roughly 350 extra damage on a 2 minute 30 second boss fight, assuming near really good uptime. Which makes it a 0.6% dps increase. While this is worth getting if you can get it easily, it isn't even close to worth getting when it takes an absolutely obscene amount of time to acquire. It would take over 150 hours to acquire this item, during which time you are making 0 progress towards any other items whatsoever. Meanwhile AV will drop an offhand that is **better** than this. While I got no issue with someone wanting to go for it, it requires an extremely ignorant view to think this item is worth obtaining, or calling it 'a lot'. Literally a single crit does more than twice as much additional damage that this item would provide on one of the longest fights in classic wow, i.e. your 150 hour upgrade pursuit can be outdone by a person getting lucky on 1 extra crit. Even in retail where min/maxing is at its peak it would be foolish to pursue an item this rare for such minimal benefit.
---
As of right now I'd actually prefer to be Alliance. Alliance groups roam around and camp and area and it's a constant stream of honour for hours.
---
On Horde there's nobody to kill and if you want to rank up tough shit.
---
Warlocks have crazy amount of spells &amp; they have to face tank melees. I'd say mage
---
That's literally the only time I PvP and I still have my honor so...
---
What do you mean "it doesn't work"? I've only used them a little but they seem to work fine for me.
---
Increasing the honorless target buff to a few minutes might have helped, but probably not. Only thing you could do is to have BGs drop the same time as honor so most of your farming happens in AV or WSG instead of raids while leveling
---
Mages don’t need Dark or Demonic Runes - with mana gems, Evo, RotAM, and Mage Armor up, you’ll never need to even use a mana pot most of the time.
---
Not able to give a yes or no answer, but I recommend watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLD12oUwJoE
---
I understand that weapon skill has a huge impact.
---
I agree with this and want to do the same with my warrior. I just find it annoying to level mining and herbalism both at the same time. Even with sequence macro- you DO go out of your way a lot more often when leveling the alt.
---
They Blink out of it all the same.
---
Haven't logged in a few weeks. Do we have an expected release date yet for BGs?
---
I pvp in this slot almost exclusively and get 4-5k honor pday
---
I’m sure things will be ok once BGs drop. Until then, we just gotta play something else or suffer
---
FAP?
---
As well as this. I expect people won't bother going into BRM as much. Instead they'll just camp the flight path.
---
So hopefully you'll have a much easier time getting into BRM.
---
Orange text good
---
Just remember! If you play on Grobbulus, respect the role play rules!
---
Alliance whining now is insufarable..most servers are balanced  alliance are ganking in droves on mine as well but just cause few servers are unbalanced NA crowd is crying here .
---
Not all servers are like your server, even your biggest Faerelina  is alliance dominated
---
Be careful with Argent Dawn quests though. Starting from some reputation level, just killing undead mobs no longer increases your AD reputation. If you don’t complete quests by then, they will be very useful to help boosting your AD rep.
---
L M A O
---
Kirtonos is alliance hell. BRM is owned by the Horde and is non stop alliance death
---
because endgame Ret Paladins are the most hardworking people, slackers just go healing or any other class...
---
What unit frames are you using?
---
Playing from level 1 with a friend (who is also new) in the same room is the absolute blast! Fun cooperation mechanics, cozy and well done world, challenges to deal with groups of mobs. So fun!
---
Leveling a convenient class like mage alone is also great. Turning quests in feels like nice accomplishments, as well as discovering a new place on the map.
---
The not so great parts for me seem to be dungeons and a bit too much slowing down when leveling. Dungeons bring a sense of constant responsibility in a group of strangers and feel exhausting. Tanking is way harder than DPS, didn't try healing yet
---
If the mats to make it just dropped to your lap from the sky, then sure. But if it's a guild effort it's a waste of resources, as is making it yourself, hence a meme
---
/spit on this screenshot
---
Ye but even so one would probably get very little honor bcs 2k kills in a raid will yield at the most 10k honor
---
Too little too late

The stop stop attack macro doesnt work for me either, i have to manually turn my character for this trick

also, did your dps get noticeably higher since u have that axe?

So, the only way to PvP for you is to grief other faction into oblivion?

for a gnome you need to be below lvl 10 and have pink ponytails and the right curves
---
When I had those qualifications, I literally had a 'Protection from Horde' spell on me 24/7  (and yes I went out all over the world as it was my goal to reach every flightmaster at low level, don't ask why)
---
I tried retail a few years ago and was overwhelmed with where to start and if it was worth it. 
---
Classic was much easier for me to get into because I have a better idea of sense of a beginning. Unfortunately I've had limited time lately and am only a level 38 rogue. 
---
Biggest thing I was worried about was getting into groups with tryhards. I play the game to relax and hangout. Not to say that I don't like dungeons, etc. I just like taking them slower as it's my first time and most experienced players like to charge through them.
---
One thing I have learned , however, for every jerkoff in the game there are 27 people eager to help you and give advice.
---
My favorite thing is the honestly just learning about all the things I can do still, even leveling my first aid, leatherworking and skinning.
---
ganks
---
I'm not sure, but I think I've heard a dev of a private server say they didn't make that restriction, but that it's actually set by Blizzard.
---
In case you're new to the game - pre raid BIS is some of the worst gear possible for PVP, and you will get lit up.  Even the "bad" Dungeon 0 tier set is better than some of the pre-raid BIS because of how much more Stamina it has.
---
There are both better PvE and PvP weapons for warriors, which you would know of you are able to theorycraft or just read this thread. The only reason a warrior has Ragna mace is because he is the guild leader / officer and his members are so dumb to help him get a useless legendary. 
---
Gonna be the same reason when you see rogues running around with thunderfury.
---
Fuckin better be man

I send out Mr. Mime and I use touch little bois dealing 6969 damage.

did you EVER wonder what that "prtscr" button on your keyboard is for?

I joined a group as a healer where the tank wanted ALL orbs, I just left and made my own group.  I'm not a fan of reserving loot but 1st orb to tank is basically required now.  All orbs makes the run not really worth it for me.

It is inevitable.

---
For what I've seen, there're no classes and you get to choose between 3 random abilities from any class every 2 levels and you can spend talent points into any talent tree, or things like that
---
Hey mate every one prob going to tell you that you can start at 43-44, that may have been true a month or two ago but the mentality of players are starting to change and they simply want higher lvls to join for less resists. Goodluck getting a ZF at that level when there is 2-10 other mages who will be higher lvl than you also looking for ZF. If you cant find a group in ZF go to swamp of sorrows and farm on mobs there, or badlands elemental rocks. Also some people might tell you that you can solo the zombies at lvl 44 and there is videos of it. Do not let these lucky run videos fool you because you need a lot of experience to deal with monsters that resist your cone of cold and novas at that level while solo in ZF. Trust me if you cant get in a dungeon go to a heavy horde area and grind pack mobs.

Sorry about ur mom, but it’s nothing personal man ur just honor points to these people it doesn’t go much deeper then that.
---
My account page shows 1st Dec 2019 as next billing date. Does that mean that I can play on the day of 30th November fully, and it switches off at some time on 1st of December?
---
Please correct my if I'm wrong, I would like to know the exact answer.
---
Pre raid BiS doesn't speficy PvP or PvE gear (I've got BiS for both). I'm well aware of itemisation for PvP compared to PvE, I just meant that I've been busy doing other things than solo-questing and getting ganked :)
---
you can return in phase 3, then 95% of these pvp fanataics will be in battlegrounds and the outdoor world will be safe again.   (safe enough for normal play, of course there will always be a bit of normal danger)
---
This is the one reason I stopped using it too on my hunter
---
Still better than bloodvine set for all the casters (or at least locks) from ZG to Naxx.
---
Firey wep OP af at low levels
---
This isn’t vanilla. I’m seeing TONNES of consumable usage in PvP at 60.
---
If a tank doesnt get agro when ony lands who ever has agro has to be ready to move to tank spot, they will most likely die but will save your raid get wiped.
---
Why did everyone downvote op? Cmon now. He was being genuine.
---
because it's a dead server which is why that's the only option for transfer
---
Just walked through the arathi portal and it said honor 20 required. Will there be an honor requirement for bgs or is this something else?

WoW Definite VR

do you even play classic?

You can literally open Reddit, go to *Create Post* \&gt; *Image &amp; Video* and just Ctrl+V. It's that easy.
---
He spawns by the fountain outside Smokeys Tobacco. You can scout for him with Mind Vision, or Eye of Kilrogg if you're a warlock
---
There generally isn't, that's why the first orb thing is kind of well known in the first place.
---
What do you mean? :D
---
I've raided with an Ony buff since mid September. When the Allies roll into BRM it's fine. It's literally like 100+ people.
---
I don’t give a shit, either. The blue color is off and that’s not even the right W.  Come to think of it upon closer inspection that doesn’t even look like frosting but some sort of paint on clay like an art project you’d see fifth graders doing, OP is a fucking zoomer
---
Fiery Weapon op, if you can, putting Crusader on WW axe is def worth it imo
---
Man wtf? Why did you take that bre when you wanted hand of rag?
---
Sorry, this confuses me isn't it 9% hit for melees? Mb if this does not apply here
---
They probably added DKs at the start with that in mind, until they put it in practice and saw that low levels were intentially griefing higher levels with DKs that they took it out and only made it for civilian quest givers.
---
If you're actually looking to debate this, please do not make up stuff for me. If you're starting by creating a strawman and pretending it to be mine, I won't take you seriously.
---
I have also no need to address a point that is no concern of me; I never said Sulfuras was BIS, therefore I have no concern to concede that you were correct to say Sulfuras was not BIS. 
---
Being worse than other items do not make an item "meme". This notion lies on nothing concrete; for it to be "meme", the weapon would need to be bad, which it isn't. It is marginally worse than others, and that's simply not enough to qualify it to be a "meme" weapon. 
---
&gt;I am not saying that it is a useless piece of shit 
---
You are though. A meme weapon is literally just that: a meme. It isn't a viable weapon, it's a meme, a litteral joke. 
---
&gt;I am, however, saying, that it has no place in a raiding environment, not because of its dps, but because its proc takes a debuff slot.
---
Big fucking deal. Once more, this is the stupid notion that anything that isn't 100% optimal is "meme" and should not raid. Fact is that this stupid retail mentality is not working in Classic and content is and will be cleared even with what elitist jerks will call to be "bad" or "meme".
---
&gt;Finally, it is a bad pvp weapon, because mace specialization is bad compared to axe and especially sword specialization.
---
More ignorance. You have zero idea how PvP works to pretend something like this; warriors often have only one or two hits to place. In such conditions, the higher the damage range on your weapon, the better. Worse: the stun proc from the mace specialization is actually very, very good. Worse: even if it was *worse* than other weapons, it does not make it *bad*.
---
Considering than *worse* = *bad* is straight up ignoring how this game works.
---
People are simply just more informed - gaming culture has come a long way since 2004.
---
Back then, you were ahead of the curve if you knew "Thottbot" existed.
---
Maybe female orcs are not your type, i will explain:

Attack speed is 2.0. But I don't care. I like him for his unique appearance.

I hope things get better for you, and I hope you find that spark again. You seem really chill and an amazing human bean from the things you’ve said
---
Blink isn't nearly as problematic if you can get a crippling poison proc.
---
Personally I prefer using Ambush since it removes half of their HP instantly and I can usually use a few more abilities before they realize what is happening.
---
My friends feel the same way I do. We're all bored and on the cusp of quitting.
---
Tell me you have been suiciding your self thinking it gives a DK
---
Wetlands
---
Yeah, Putting crusader on WW axe is the plan, but he's only lvl 15 so far
---
bank alt not level 5 residentsleeper
---
I was surprised to find this big gap in protection with my first plate pants.
---
I think thats it
---
Ty for pointing out!!! Think i'm not horny enough loll.
---
Mages can win against every class pretty easily
---
Leveling as a backstab max crit spec is real rough luckily I have a main and 3 friends with 60s to keep my main hand best in slot as I lvl.
---
Mace/sword spec for humans brings it down to 6%. And the talent in print tree us 3%. So we only need 3% from gear. If you're overcapped from gear you can drop the talent though.
---
raiding since week 3 here - got 2 OEB last week and one SR in the very first raid as we pugged (went to random of course).
---
No bindings, no eye, no recipes, no weapons at all besides the 2 OEB and 2 Mageblades ... but hey, 5 Vendorstrikes and 6 times the shadow dmg dagger :)))
---
I thought it was strange the other day when I was missing 4k honor from early morning city ganking.
---
Rocket boosts (they changed them to belt for some reason) still have a chance to melt your hp or make you fly into the air. You get a free parachute now though, kinda takes away from it.
---
Engineering is even cooler in retail though, imo. They've kept it up.
---
You always have 2 chars, one main and one you level with your friend on only
---
wrong game
---
And im saying its way more than enough
---
Setting it to hide doesn't change the toolbar in front of the game. (It does change it on my second monitor.) But I also don't want the toolbar to hide normally. Before this morning it was never in front of the game even without setting it to hide.
---
"it creates brainless outnumbered PvP most of the time"
---
Again with the victim mentality lol
---
True but it will all change so soon you won't get very far ahead and you can only rank up so quick that it won't have very much of an effect over people who don't actively PvP until battlegrounds.
---
The combat log is ingame, the addon reads the combat log, use your brain once in a while buddy
---
Yeah even guessed it with the damn cake
---
It says level 20 required.
---
[nice](https://i.imgur.com/qlyGgZg.png)

holy shit, Dalvengyr was my first server as well :o Did you continue playing on it in BC and Wrath?
---
Rebooting fixed it. Thank you.
---
Great... thanks
---
Or just don't apply as much rouge (if any), if you don't want people to notice it.
---
Even in mc i feel like they drop infrequently, definitely a group of 40 uses much more than drops anyway
---
Yea :s
---
Neither of them are huge must-have upgrades. On the other hand grinds like that give you something to chase which is always nice.

Warlocks and priests annihilate mage wym.

I haven't tried it myself, I read about it somewhere (not too many hours ago). I'm not 100% sure, but I feel like a simple /target Skul when entering through the main entrance should be within targeting range. I'll try when I get home on my priest
---
They're like 3g on my server. I just don't think they're that useful.  The stuff you can craft doesn't seem great, and the pots only require 1 per pot. I haven't done MC yet, but from what I've read, most guilds are at the point where they don't even need them. Add the two together and you get a weak economy.

well it didn't slow down anyway since his post... there is empirical evidence for that\^\^

miss the old reddit... Nobody gives a fuck about your cake. Don’t believe me, check the likes.

ya its not a huge deal. dm takes like 60 mins and that shit always drops
---
As I learned leveling my Warrior, Fiery is ridiculous. You'll probably be using a slow weapon so it will proc a lot for you, and the damage early on is great.
---
You've literally never said optimal until this post... Now you're going to say "incorrect" to someone even though it's not required or even considered optimal anyway? Shadow protection pot is a meme on nefarian, that's like saying you pop a fire protection pot on geddon as it is "optimal". You're making things up to sound like a pseudo intellect even though you asked people to google something for you.
---
I can't wait to watch the mental gymnastics of you trying to discredit my geddon comparison.
---
Arathi- the low level elementals have those too, the high ones just have more options of drops.
---
High quality random trash video! I like it!
---
ZF Ulda and Mara are imo the best 3 dungeons in classic. After that they wither get too confusing to navigate or too dull.
---
Idk I have always felt the need to keep my action bars predominately in vision. I think its because DK in WoTLK was the first time I was ever super serious about raiding. DK was pretty micro intense with rp/ runes
---
No i recommend relationship counseling instead
---
It was probably a symptom of a much larger problem with his behavior.
---
I think problem would be that this kind of mod would force people to actually get it in the end. That is because there would be less and less people searching for group "traditional" way and you would hinder yourself by not using the mod.
---
Same drop as felwood with just as much pvp tho
---
Un'Goro crater, but it is not safe anymore. It is camped 24/7 by annoying gnome mages with epic mounts.
---
You don't even know what a greater fire protection pot is, or what your classes optimal consumables are... You sound like you snuck into a guild that's way over your head.
---
I regularly get firewater, E'ko and beads when killing them. You just had a bad string of luck.
---
It happens. I killed over 200 fire Entropic Beasts/Horrors one night and got zero elemental fire. Literally not one. I use MobInfo2 to track my kills. My % went from 7% down to 4%, and that's impressive considering how many I'd already farmed.
---
2 nights ago, I was roaming for some pvp and noticed that the place was deserted due to pvp. I went in and got 5 elemental fire within about 25 mob kills. One dropped ele fire, essence and next mob dropped ele fire. Random is random.
---
You shouldn't block anything you can blink against a rogue I (most of the time, only applies to 1v1)
---
For rag you still pop at least one so at best they get as many per run as they spend. I feel like the price is gonna keep rising
---
To not farm the shadow wrath one?
---
Isn't it 20% -&gt; 30% of dmg dealt?
---
So 58 heal with give 290 dmg, turn that into 30% for 87 heal. That's quite the improvement.
---
What you did was get 10% from the 20%, making it 22%.
---
You would think they have something better to farm...
---
It involves mind control to force the honorless landing person to remove the honorless buff. Its clever use of mechanics I see as an exploit because its definitely not what blizzard intended.
---
Not only that but it never ends. There are always more runs, more gear, more annoying things to do. I feel bad telling people no, but holy shit you have to be a self starter in classic to go far
---
Gotta love the superiority complex.
---
You're the one whining right now, seems like.
---
Why is there a hidden russian flag in this image
---
They use a priest to MC target, force them to attack the person they’re dueling(which removes honorless buff since they attacked) and then they kill them and camp.
---
Imagine thinking retail = TBC.
---
Dat blink
---
And how did you manage to get to the Barrens without being slaughtered by the Horde?
---
Not using addons puts you at a disadvantage to those who do. Fact.
---
Not using all of the tools at your disposal in the game makes you perform less than others. Fact.
---
Performing less than others willingfully makes you a noob. Fact.
---
If you think addons are cheating, you are a noob. Fact.
---
If you don't use addons any decent raiding guild will kick you. Fact.
---
Anyone who ever competed in any high end PVP in WoW used addons. Fact.
---
Fuck outta here noobie boi. I don't fucking understand how these morons defend not using addons like they are some kind of messiah or something. YOU ARE JUST BEING A NOOB. PERIOD.
---
Woah there buddy, I didn't mean to offend you. All I asked for is what to prepare for in BWL. If there is shadow damage on Nefarian, I'll be sure to bring shadow protection pots. 
---
The fact that I never used the word "optimal" in my original post is because I figured it was obvious that I'm not asking for which potions not to bring, or second best consumables
---
Haha, you just reminded me of the post where some guy had a few stacks of them in a bag cuz they were trying to beat their PR and he got called out for even using one in whole MC and then a few posts later it was a group downing him with only a few members alive so I wrote on the 1st post to those calling him out whether they take off gear if more than one person is alive after each trash pull
---
Not really necessary. There are plenty of warriors, rogues and hunters how will happily take you in for couple of runs just to have less competition for HoJ and the epic chest.
---
That's The Rake, ech is normal speed
---
Umm maybe the top 1% but I find myself holding up pretty well against most. And I said most classes not all
---
If it's not an unpopular opinion, why did my post about it get downvoted endlessly and never get above 5 points?
---
more accurate will be to be instant frost nova since mage already knew you are around him with his spy addon...
---
Rogues get shit on by a lot of classes though.  It ends up balancing out.
---
By having the highest top-end damage by a large margin, "lol".
---
"I disagree with you therefor you didn't read"
---
nice
---
"you are literally wrong lmao"
---
Nice counterargument.
---
I was thinking of sap when I ice blocked in my head.
---
But as Retri you will not need it to deal damage. Sure there are utility talents, but if you ware only focusing on raid performance, then you only need 30 points in Retribution for vengeance, 11 in Holy for Consecration and 8 in Protection for the +3% hit. Anything else is just for utility.
---
28 still.
---
Sounds extremely low level.  So yes, this is how its suppose to be.  But this will end once you get high enough for the herd to bother with you.  
---
Basically, this is like a 10 year old saying that paying taxes isn't so bad.
---
I'm sorry for your situation, keep your head up. I'd like to offer you a change in mindset if I may.
---
World of Warcraft has an honour system that requires a currency to be farmed, honour, which yields access to powerful rewards at specific ranking thresholds. To rank, as of right now, until battlegrounds that are physically not out yet, the one and only way to grind, is to kill players that are within Honor range.
---
Honor range is stated by Blizzard as being 10 levels, but I believe it's 48 or 49 where you're technically still worth Honor to a level 60. These kills have subsequent diminishing returns where the person will be worth less and less each time to that person, forcing pvpers to move on, but in severe faction imbalance, fresh people to always be ready to kill. 
---
It is unequivocally normal human behaviour, even with the context you've given, for you to be killed at least 4 times, by every...single...player that sees you. Completely normal, encouraged, systematically designed for reward, human behaviour. 
---
My point being, you're on a PvP server, that Blizzard ruined through failed faction balance controls, you should send this letter addressed to the CEO of Blizzard, and ask him to hold his people accountable to better faction balance controls.
---
Don't shame players for playing the game as it was literally designed to be played, and not holding the company accountable who lazily allowed the social framework around the game to rot, causing insane imbalances that you now see.
---
TLDR: Change your frame of mind, you're screaming into the wind that it's wrongly accosting you. It's not, it doesn't even know who you are, it's wind that's does what wind does.
---
Yea... The friend specifically seeks out a place where the fun they want to have is within the rules, and that's somehow being an a-hole...
---
Baffling...
---
Flair checks out
---
Just passing through but a different user said incorrect not OP.
---
You going to cry because the big bad horde are Zugging you too?
---
As a level 52 Horde, questing is still a non issue for me. I see quite a few of Horde and I’m also an aggressive PvPer so I have a really good k/d ratio even tho it holds no importance. This is also my third time leveling a Warlock to 60 so I have a good grasp on my class and some of the Alliance I attack still keyboard turn as I run around them. SPY is a must to stay alert ofc
---
More likely that this never happened
---
I thinks it's mainly due to the fact that most PvP trait are horde sided and everyone thinks they're better than the alliance one regarding PvP or not(whether they're true or not isn't important)
---
So what I think IS that most Guild/Players having hardcore or semi hardcore PvP in top priority regarding what they except from the game rolled Horde whereas I think most alliance rolled Ally for style/PvE even tought they're also a lot of hardcore PvP player in alliance, don't get me wrong.
---
Because non-contested zones and instances don’t exist?  You think you’re the only one that gets ganked???  Lolol
---
Transferred to earthfury from faerlina. It feels like I am playing vanilla again. Good world PvP in reasonable numbers, fun dungeons, nicer people. I have actually had a few groups without a mage in them which just doesn't happen on bigger servers.
---
I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm honestly having a really hard time understanding what you're saying. I'm sorry. I'm actually interested in reading what you have to say, but I can't make sense of what you typed initially.
---
Bad form guild!!!
---
vanguard!
---
Zone sharding, you took too long to connect to the new zone.
---
What ms are you playing with?
---
Can you do me a favor and go link this thread to the Fight Club discord, and ask them who of us are right and who is wrong? More specifically which of BRE and HoR you should use for pvp, or even just which is better of sword or mace specialization?
---
Not entirely new to WoW, I've played a couple months in retail back in MoP, but it was a very "casual" experience. I think I was also either in a PVE server or on a completely horde-dominated one back then, so there's that too.
---
Classic is fun, and not quite as archaic as I was expecting, but there's something very... bland about it, for me. There are way too many "collect 20 bear asses" or "kill 15 of each type of enemy" quests - Hinterlands was especially absurd about it, adding up every enemy type I had to kill for quests came up to something like 200 mobs just for generic quests. Some of the areas look nice and feel good to explore, but they start to feel very generic after a while, like "hmm, yes, another forest". That gets much better in BC and onwards, in my experience, with the floating islands, crazy tiered snow mountains, and MoP in particular was fucking delightful to explore. I was also hoping to see more lore and NPC interactions, but there are almost no story lines in the zones, you're just a glorified postman with a sword.
---
You're also a lot weaker in Classic compared to other mobs, and it makes the day to day grind a bit annoying. I'm a druid, one of the most self-sufficient classes in the game, and pulling a second mob my own level by accident makes me go "uh oh". 3 mobs? Pretty much dead already if you can't run. I'm one of those that plays MMOs generally as single player games and really just care for groups for dungeons and such, so that's annoying - retail was a lot more "solo-friendly". And as a small personal gripe, I really liked titles and achievements in retail, and it was a bummer to not see them here yet.
---
This is also more of a Classic problem, but the servers are packed way too full of people, and everyone knows the best ways to grind already, so anything even vaguely worth farming is overfarmed. Black Lotus? Camped the whole day. Pools of Elemental Water in Azshara? Like 6 dudes swimming around for them at any given time. Furbolg camps? Felwood satyr camps? Toxic Horrors? All full, all day long.
---
I've had a lot of fun so far, I'm just about to ding 60 (possibly today), but my sub is also running out and I'm not sure I'm going to bother resubbing for the 60 gear treadmill. GF has been wanting to try FFXIV, and I'm likely going there instead.
---
&gt; Expect PvP bis gear lists soon
---
Can't wait. Been looking for a good (especially enhancement) pvp gear list/guide for a while.
---
Yeah that's an unpopular opinion alright.
---
I wouldn't say brand new, a lot of stuff that comes out is from RS3 but actually good not trash lol.
---
Not all is ofc.
---
How does this make any sense. There's literal guides that are min max oriented that you can google within 5 seconds.
---
I would never assume you were talking about min max by your post because you never mentioned it.
---
It's crazy to say anything otherwise.
---
should be under indicators for the pet frame. if you dont see that, turn on advanced options or whatever it's called
---
Warcraftlogs suggests otherwise.
---
Hey guys, found another asshole!
---
IMO it’s very worth it and super underrated. It’s basically two points for many, many hundreds of extra HP per group member while PvPing. One mindblast on an imp. VE target is basically the bonus you’re getting from imp fort, and more valuable because it continues healing and it’s not just top end health.
---
I actually like 21/0/30 better because of the relative trade-offs.
---
Losing the top end of Elemental actually doesn't mean all that much outside of a PvP context. In fights longer than about a minute, Elemental Shaman have to increasingly downrank Lightning Bolt for mana reasons. However, you can't downrank all that far before you reach the point where your Lightning Bolts are less dps than simply breaking out a weapon and melee'ing. In 5-man and solo content, the superior burst of a top tank Lightning Bolt strategy is solid - but the downturn you incur means it normally slows you down over a slightly slower fight with minimal downtime.
---
On the other hand, the top end of Resto is very important for Chain Heal and basically essential for calling yourself a 'healer' in 5-man content.
---
It's not a bad weapon in itself, it's meme status comes from it being unreasonably expensive to make. No one is arguing the weapon itself is bad for pvp, everyone is arguing it's a meme weapon because you sink TONS of resources into making something subpar. You're being childish for assuming everyone else is arguing the weapon itself in a vacuum, when clearly the point is *the cost of making the fucking weapon*
---
Not shocking that when it isn’t a 5:1 ratio, they’re garbage at pvp.
---
yeah i going with a night elf so ill def now go to gahhenas. If u play there is there any trouble woth streamers ? (if there is streamers at all) idk

We have a few reports of people still getting honor, it could be how the server interprets reset time. We still have hundreds now with broken honor sheets where honor is at 0, never rolled over, and fully garbled honor sheets.
---
You can never entirely remove ganking, obviously, but coupling its realease with the release of BGs would have reduced ganking significantly. Honour farming would take place mostly in BGs. I thought this was evident?

I have no clue what that means?

Does anyone have any good resources for healing strategies and what a healing leader would do? I volunteered do be the healing leader for my guild's new raid group on my alt, because no one else wanted to. I have been clearing MC with my guild for months on my warlock main so I know the fights, but I don't know specific healer strategies like how and when to assign healers to specific tanks, which fights we will need healer priorities on debuffs, that kind of thing. I do have someone who can help me out, but I want to be as prepared as possible.

So far they havnt responded. PVP is broken for thousands, and unreliable for most.

You're the person that doesn't know what a greater fire protection potion is, after clearing MC...

You're the person that doesn't know any of their literature for min maxing, but allegedly knows of min maxing and can't find the content on Google...Again, maybe work on yourself first.

The ones I've seen have been level 48+ chars which is honor for 60s
---
It's not just "not bad", *it's an insanely good weapon*. 
---
Yes, lots of people are hiding behind a stupid "BIS only" mentality and calling is bad for PvE and PvP. Look at replies I've got in there, and you'll see that it clearly isn't about the cost first, but about "what is BIS" first.

Aren't you automatically flagged in areas dominated by the opposing factor (I.e. Barrens) even in a PvE server?

Should be 35 I believe
---
At end game wouldn't it be almost hard to get pieces that are bis without them happening to have hit tho? Maybe now that isn't an issue and I don't play melee so I'm not sure but a lot of caster gear in naxx has hit on it but even without the hit it would still be better anyway than the gear that came before it

&gt; There has been discussion about it decreasing either the frequency of glancing blows, or the damage reduction of them. It's possible this is true but I haven't gone to any effort to test it with different gear sets. Maybe when the next Vendorstrike drops.
---
There's no real debate about this, just misinformed people. Higher weapon skill reduces the *penalty* of your glancing blows, meaning they will hit closer to 100% damage, but you will *always* have a 40% chance to glance a boss level mob
---
well, It did, and its a recommended possible resolution to this issue on official forums.  soooo... you do you, ima play without lag.
---
30k in retail is about 20g in Classic.

Weak. I once knew a boy who had 272 days played by the time Naxx released in Vanilla\*
---
I've had a few 1v1s in the last week and they were awesome.  
---
I am a mage and fought a druid, and we both got down to maybe 10% hp. The druid healed herself and I was ready to run, and I did a bit, but then I turned around and blinked into the cone of cold. She was at 25% health at that point and I was at 10% but she was out of mana. Frost nova into blink and a couple frostbolts and she dies, but I aggro'd a mob at the same time. Ended up using ice block until my blink was back up and made it out. It was really fun.  
---
It's a shame occurrences like that are so rare especially for allies.
---
What a waste...Gz on it though

As alliance, mine started with Fallen Hero of the Horde NPC at the entrance to blasted, a 4 quest chain "Petty Squables", that opens up another 9 quest chain with "Kirith" which opens up another 5 quest chain "The Formation of Felbane" up to "

I play both. I play retail solo and play classic as a war/preist combo. Retail is more solo friendly, while classic rewards group play.
---
Why are people on this sub so eager to blame pservers for literally everything
---
People trying to do their best in the game is not "reee evil toxic pserver culture", it's simply people being infinitely more informed than they were in 2005.
---
Just wait till BGs come out, the horde are seriously in for a rude awakening.
---
Cleave groups and such are long gone on our server unfortunately.
---
There's absolutely no doubt that both American colleges and American high schools are ridiculously easy. Unless you're going for an Ivy League school or similar, most college curriculums could be done in half the time, but they slow all the classes down so more people can pass.

Haha, smallest server EU und yet we gather here :D I played there till early-mid BC and moved to Azshara after a while. Been on plenty of servers since and spent much more time on other servers, but dalvengyr still feels like home.

Enjoy the next 17 days because it is going away at that point.  Also feel bad for everyone quitting those lopsided servers because no one wants to re-roll after putting in 3 months worth of work.
---
But why?
---
use your new spare time on finding the printscreen button
---
No Just on a pvp Server.. Only automatic flagging happens in enemys capitals i think
---
Yes but he said that if he saw them asking for a while (ie not plenty more tanks out there) he will offer to do it for an orb.  And just as happily, it sounds, not go if that isn't an acceptable arrangement.
---
You ok?
---
At that point, why roll paladin?  It's not like vanilla is unexplored territory where the illusion of ret dps being a thing exists.
---
You're a ghost. The game only let's you see enemy playere close to your body as a ghost.
---
I don't know what to tell you man that's just not true on my server. There is one priest that does this and is high ranked. Multiple warlocks and warriors got bracket 1-2 honor on my server and its in the top 5 most populated.

Rage is an awkward resource.  It is really slow until you start getting geared at 60.  The more damage you do the more rage you get.  My fury warrior fills up his entire rage bar in about 5-6 seconds while raiding.

Yeet

That helped alot thanks!
---
You can also go to the second floor.
---
Helps that the alliance has some badass guilds and organization. I honestly feel all the time like Horde is the side that’s outnumbered, and it’s just because we’re running around like bumbling idiots and the alliance has their shit together.
---
Marginally worse for an ultra expensive weapon is stupid.
---
My server has them at 6-9 gold each, but we're Alliance on an imbalanced server so camp spots are often taken by Horde. I expect the price to decrease somewhat as more people realize how trivial MC and Ony are (I haven't used a GFPP since the 2nd clear personally) and demand becomes lower, though there may be a short spike when BWL launches and people want more pots for progression.
---
Its depressing playing the same game for +10 years
---
Because literally doing a quarter of everyone else's damage isn't fun?  Being overlooked for everything isn't fun?  Every ret I've met just gets extremely upset when they are turned down/somebody comments about their damage being shit.  Great in pvp is also a pretty big stretch.   They are fine, but not really anything special.
---
If you're not downing him before his submerge definitely make sure you have Mana left or a potion/rune to pop. Having Mana for that is far more important that topping the dps chart.
---
There are hundreds of people on the bug forums with the issue, some with proof, some without. You dont need to stick up for blizzard over a game breaking bug for a lot of users.
---
The subreddit is cross-realm and we know how people complained about that...
---
I interpreted his post that there is no idea to complete the Linken quest chain for the Aquementas OH because there will be a better one in 3 weeks (+reputation grind)
---
If you want to level as elemental, you should not focus on spell power, but rather intellect and spirit. You cannot find gear with enough spell power at that level for it to matter. There is mail gear around with these stats, but there is just so much more cloth items. You will most likely have an upper hand in PvP due to spellbatching with CL and frost shock crits.
---
Everything you complained about has been fixed in retail, which is pretty funny to me, because I completely agree too. Except the community, that's something no game can fix.
---
Basically, feels like if you'd played a mix of actual vanilla where tryhards were much rarer and retail where the mechanics aren't clunky and unfun anymore, you'd have had a blast.

Are you horde or alliance? I can rn only tell you for horde.
---
On horde side shamans are group healers. Especially for melee groups, but also ranged if they are clumped together. Druids are at least on my raid usually used as tank healers. But priests as well. 
---
There are some fights like Lucifron or Golemagg (dunno rn) where priests dont heal and only dispell. On fights like Ragnaros priests are usually tank heals while shamans are melee heals.
---
On alliance side I believe priests are usually group heals while paladins are tank heals.

I have a /spit macro for when someone buffs me.

Similar boat, 60 arms warr. I don’t feel like running dungeons I just do it to get gear which is kinda dumb if I’m not having fun. I do love raid nights but after 3-4 hrs and no gear for me I have to wonder why I’m spending my time doing this ha. I def enjoyed leveling more since there was always incremental progress. However, super excited for BGs! That’s fun and you can just hop on, play a round and bounce. 
---
Also way better when you can play with RL friends or close in game friends so there’s no pressure and you know everyone is listening.

The [Broodling Essence](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4726/broodling-essence) questline. Takes you through UBRS several times, to winterspring and back, and finally ends in scholomance.

[Dawns Gambit](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4771/dawns-gambit), the final quest in the chain provides you with an item that allows you to solo the Vectus room with ease, who just so happens to drop an excellent [shadowpriest necklace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18691/dark-advisors-pendant)
---
Agreed. I also believe that they should be using seal of righteousness to essentially double the Proc chance of the weapon. Spell power also scales better with righteousness than it does command.
---
It’s a windows issue not WoW. Sometimes I gotta alt tab a bunch to get wow back on top
---
Kromcrush is great.
---
I hope that only same type realms get connected. 
---
So PvP alliance and PvE horde never has to worry about waiting
---
Right now in MC there's no need for healing strategy.  
---
Just throw in 10-12 healers and rely on DPS killing stuff before they OOM.  
---
Paladins for example could heal MC in greens and still be top-1 HPS.  
---
About debufs - that's easy. There's either full-raid debuffs like on Magmadar or nothing. Just use Decursive and you will see it very well.
---
More guards! #makeclassicretail

It's not just that but all the dungeons and quests you need to do to get your pre-raid bis, and depending on your luck it could literally take you weeks.

100% Deja classic stats.

Has happened in MC 4 weeks in a row, always in the bend/hallway to get to Golemagg

If you look at the change log for the addon, it started to get heavy UI changes (not localization changes) days before it first started to happen to me. Have been using the addon itself since the start of classic and never had issues in MC for 1.5 months.

Fun fact, BRE or DBx2/DB+Flurry is a lot better for orcs than spinal.
---
There was a theory that they did it because Census was causing these faction imbalances on the high-pop servers - people realised they were outnumbered on a server, so transferred off. If so, it kinda seems like they were treating the symptom rather than the disease :/
---
This is super helpful, thanks a lot!
---
This could end up a good thing. If you dungeon grind from 50 - 60, the left over quests from that bracket at lvl 60 will net you around 500g. Do them before 60, and its significantly less.

Or on many of the "collect something on the ground" quests like the feathers in the hinterlands

What does "elitist" mean? I don't want other people to waste my time. Is that elitist, or is that something we can all agree on? Yes, it's possible to clear MC with a bunch of players who didn't spend their talent points. Or players who didn't bother farming pre-BIS. It's also possible to smash my hands with a hammer. Why would I do either? Is it elitist to not want to have bad players inflicted upon me? To me, that sounds like common sense.  
---
Don't blame others for your badness, or for not being like-minded. Just find some people who are as casual/hardcore as you are.

No flair but I am horde
---
Overworld leveling will be very frustrating. Expect to die any time you take a boat, or arrive in a contested zone (STV, Tanaris, SS) 
---
You will die a lot progressing your body to SM... 
---
However, it’s doable. Honestly I don’t care about timelines at all- and getting mad is part of the fun. 
---
I can usually out play the horde guys because they are, on the whole, lazy and conditioned to camp easy exits/entrances, etc. 
---
And when it just gets to be too much, I hearth back to a safe Inn and walk away.
---
Oof. I doubt my child self would have even thought to solo it. 😅
---
Not on my server. Alliance won't quick because they want to play with their precious Asmongold.
---
Hey man, glad I could help you to blow off some steam! And I know it can be hard to forget those bad groups but try to remember those good groups you join. Add those people to your friends list so you can group with them again. And tell people you enjoyed grouping so that they may hit you up to group again. 
---
I'm glad you have a buddy to help you along. Definitely makes a huge difference.
---
Yeah I’m threat capped. I can’t go full dps or I pull threat. Highest so far was 680 but that was throttling and I still pulled aggro.
---
Shhhhh don’t tell anyone about our perfection
---
Ive enjoyed it. Leveling was fun, especially liked the feeling when you run through a dungeon with all the dungeon quests and turn them in. Now I've been raiding with my guild for a few months and the atmosphere is chill but we still get stuff done.
---
I remember this happening in vanilla too. There is some point during the night that you can log out and your honor sheet will be updated for the previous day. But if you don't log out, it isn't updated. But the honor is still added up and you don't lose anything. The only issue is the honor sheet.
---
Alot of people want to play them but switch specs to other Druid ones.
---
Leveling now is the real classic.
---
You know how I know you've never done a single raid at 60 in Classic? Because of this: 
---
&gt;Because literally doing a quarter of everyone else's damage isn't fun? Being overlooked for everything isn't fun? Every ret I've met just gets extremely upset when they are turned down/somebody comments about their damage being shit. 
---
Nobody gives a fuck about your damage as a Paladin. Same goes for Shamans and Druids. As long as you do what you're told, don't stand in fire, dispel when needed, you'll get an invite as a Paladin/Shaman. Their buffs THAT good. I mean we're clearing Ony with like 20 people and MC with 30. I don't know who you play with, but Paladins (the class) is always wanted in raids on my server regardless of their spec. Yes, Ret Paladins get invites to raids for their utilities. 
---
And I disagree. Ret is great in PvP. They can easily 2v1 most classes.
---
I don't want them to change anything. If they were to turn back on server transfers, the server would get even worse to the point where no one would play on it just because there would be no Alliance. Even if they were to bring in paid transfers, I'm sure the end result would still be quite similar. And that would just make more people mad because of Activision getting their cash. They could test faction queues on some servers if they wanted to, but I wouldn't want them to add it on every server right from the get-go without seeing what people thought about it.
---
I would bet the type of people who love "pretty" races just stuck to retail.
---
Retail has transmog, more attractive races, toys, pets etc. Its perfect for them.
---
Usually I use it for spawned mobs, non elite mobs, or mobs that are next to a boss that will pull with the boss.
---
That's nice, we been raiding since week 4 and the only 2hs we got were 2 Shadowstrikes and a Finkle's Lava Dredger. 
---
We have some depressed and thirsty warriors.
---
Log it then. Also you're comparing a random 50% parsing rogue to literally the highest Ret parser and it's still barely similar.
---
Even horde warriors/rogues should be doing 600+ on rag if we're talking actual good dps. Alliance even higher due to salv.
---
And for any other fight in the instance, real melee are doing 800-1k or more.
---
And that's your opinion. Who knows what the majority opinion is. I for one, would like cakes, tattoos and most art banned from the subreddit.
---
Why are you arguing when you are wrong? Even 1 lifetap that can be replaced by a rune is 1.5/2.5 of a shadowbolt, and youre argument about movement is bad bc when you move you can use dcoil and shadowburn. 
---
Id recommend defending wrong arguments less and critically thinking more
---
Punished how? Low level targets are not the same as dishonorable targets.
---
Wtf is that?
---
Get a Lionheart Helm you fuckin’ loser.
---
You can forget about reaching max level by questing, it’s the same for both sides, it’s not that bad in lower level areas, but in lvl 50+ areas you are more dead than alive.
---
Most of the time it is not, when heavily outnumbered. Look yesterday we had a late night farm group of 5 men and killed our way up and down against solo players  and other squads in Felwood. We never fully wiped. We always kept on going and never corpsecamped. Then at some point after 100 kills or so,we wiped against another horde squad, when we just finished off 2 other players. We ran to our corpses to rezz and guess what? 15 horde were camping us. We just logged off after 15 minutes. On dragons call it is always like that. Don't know what the fun is in corpsecamp, but it happens non stop as the underdog faction.
---
Man, you are stressing out way too much over a video game.
---
I like most things about the game, just find it incredibly frustrating how most PvP encounters are just griefing. I've had a handful of fun, challenging, and exciting PvP experiences, the rest is just skull-levels shitting on me for their own amusement. When I see a Horde 10 levels below me I either leave them alone or help them out if they're struggling with something. I was in that valley in STV with all the gorillas for a while yesterday and in that time two different low-level horde characters came to farm the same spot. They each eventually got ganged up on by a bunch of the gorillas and I saved both of them. I could have killed them but it would have taken literally no effort and wouldn't really have been fun for anyone. Then later I tried taking a boat to Kalimdor but there were skull levels on every one of them and every time they either killed me before I could get on the boat, or MC'd me off the boat and made me swim back to the docks to try again. And then half the time when I mention it on here I get told I'm a stupid whiny bitch and I should have known all of this before even booting up the game for the first time.
---
So if we ban any kind of "art", what is the sub left with?
---
Memes and "hey guys look I just got this item" posts.
---
&gt; It's a very well documented thing. 
---
No it absolutely isn't.
---
There are vintage 2006 tables stating -30% damage at +0 WS to 0% reduction at +10 WS. There are private server tables stating it's actually -40% at +0 WS to 0% at +10 WS. Wowwiki says pre-2.1 increasing your weapon skill above level\*5 has no effect on glancing blows at all. Beta theorycrafting (Beaza's?) states that it goes from both a \~40% to \~10% chance to occur and a \~35% to \~5% reduction between 300 and 315 WS. There is no ability to differentiate between current accurate information, half-finished test results form the beta when people cared, what's incorrect info passed on from private servers, what's info actually referring to BC, what's just pure speculation peddled as fact etc. etc.
---
It would be foolish to believe any of this shit without verifying it yourself- there are simply too many competing theories and none of the prevailing ones explain how logs look entirely... with nearly every warrior or rpal at 25-30% glancing blows, doing around 10% damage reduction. Given I have 313 weapon skill I'm highly sensitive to the fact that 305-&gt;313 gives no apparent improvement in glancing blows. Since basically everyone has +5 weapon skill one way or another, to really get a baseline you need to find an active raider that's raided with a clean 300 weapon skill over several weeks (good luck), or test it yourself. 
---
Just pouring over some logs from other guilds to find warriors with 300 skill while writing this post, the improvement probably isn't as sharp as suggested by [the most recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/djdquy/melee_damage_and_you_a_comprehensive_overview_of/). 300 skill looks like it's more around a \~30% damage reduction -&gt; \~13% reduction at 305, and from 305 to 313 you probably only gain a couple more percent if anything. Weapon skill clearly doesn't decrease your chance to glancing blow at all. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if there were two equations just like there is for the reduction in your chance to miss.
---
In any case I wasn't going to just pass on information as gospel unless I know that it's correct, especially if my own observation disagreed. I don't see why mentioning it but saying I hadn't properly tested it deserved a downvote.
---
&gt; OEB is also more dps than either Bonereavers Edge or Spinal Reaper for non-humans/orcs by the way.

Do you have a sim showing that? I'm on our loot council and a human warrior asked for a **Spinal fucking Reaper** as an upgrade over OEB in PVE and I was overruled when I said it wasn't an upgrade. Any information expanding on this would be appreciated.
---
Warlocks have one of if not the highest skill cap. They also require a shit ton of binds.
---
I just said it doesnt
---
Yeah it's tough when you put that much time into a character to realize you don't like the play style. But it's good you realized that now rather than further down the line when you're 60 and in raiding! 😁
---
so cool!
---
Please explain what kind of sorcery this is
---
&gt;Enjoy the next 17 days because it is going away at that point.
---
no its not

f mega

Heartseeker PvP 60:40 alliance:horde. So it’s actually balanced.
---
To be fair the difference is probably the number of subs retail pulls in now
---
No, it's not even CLOSE to the elitist gamer culture from 2004. The top end guilds were never this toxic.
---
In my experience on Incendius it seems pretty even. I've seen both factions camp cities/FPs. I don't think it's just "a horde thing".
---
I play on EF.  One thing you might find interesting is that Faerlina has 4800 characters on Warcraftlogs while EF has 1800. That’s pretty different, but not THAT different. If every 3 pack of roamers on Faerlina was replaced by a solo, that’s EF. The world of EF feels quite full. There are some costs ofc. We don’t have a 24/7 Hillsbrad battle. But Gorge, EPL, and Kargath tends to light up with zerg vs zerg at different points in the night, if that’s your thing. 
---
There are actually more horde raiding guilds than alliance right now, and most guilds are clearing with &lt;40, so lots of open recruiting.  We have recently had a few Alliance guilds transfer over, so we actually need more horde to keep the balance.
---
If the closest mob is 57, it will aggro. 55 or 56, you're good to go
---
That's pretty funny. I get it now. Thanks for breaking it down for me and explaining what you meant; I appreciate it.
---
very nice read, thank you for sharing your perspective!
---
some of your worries actually made me laugh, not because of schadenfreude but because i think every single person went through that at some point.
---
i can also definitely see wowclassic being exponentially "top heavy", the better you are at the game the more fun you have.
---
combat will go from sluggish but too bursty to methodic and reactive with alot of prediction going on. (which can obv only happen when you know what to predict)
---
its also like comparing lol to dota. lol doesnt have turn value (long cast times in wow) wich makes it faster ( like black desert for example) while dota does have turn value. dota (wowclassic) rewards positioning heavily because you have to commit to your casts.
---
world pvp on a low level is mindless blizzard and aoe spamming and with a dedicated group you feel like actually fighting a war, trying to route and engage the enemy.
---
rogues and druids are scouts to determine enemy position and movement aswell as assessing combat strength. they or the raidlead are also responsible for checking streams, raidtimes of the enemy factions and any other indication of enemy positions.
---
hunters are counter intelligence with their tracking, traps and flares against rogues and druids.
---
warriors are spearmen holding the frontlines in an engagement or they are disrupting and tanking as much damage as possible.
---
mages are cavalry, rushing as a group through the enemy ranks trying to get as deep as possible to destroy their backline.
---
priests, paladins, warlock are the backbone, their support making or breaking the fight.
---
the fact that you feel like an "outsider" inside of your own guild is terrible :s. if you and the time you invest doesnt seem to get recognition i would seek a 1on1 with the responsible person in your guild. if they dont "need" you, there are countless guilds who do, even when they "have" to "teach" you.
---
you may also want to take a break. it might feel like you have to rush but truth be told, even the most dedicated guilds will run weekly mc until at least aq (phase5) and there should be alot of catchup guilds springing up around zg(phase4).
---
for me wow helped me with my anxiety. the need for interaction went from stressful to a mild invoncenience.
---
we have two regular arms warriors. They both have earthshaker btw. It's freakin hilarious  when we take them over to 5 mans, or on like the imps in mc they're just instantly stunned. Did you know the healers on domo can be stunned? We know :)
---
give me 20$ right now  
---
you're planning on making money for years to come, will it really hurt you?
---
Is there any use for Scourgestones and Argent Dawn Valor Tokens after I've reached exalted and gotten the Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn? Is there a way to buy more stuff from the Argent Dawn with them?
---
^^
---
Rogues can stealth so you already have a huge advantage, and there’s two of you?  Sounds like you can just do the ganking yourself or you can just hide but generally its worse in the higher level zones.  There aren’t packs of level 60s hunting down level 30s very often.
---
bye
---
It is awesome, but in moderation honestly. And what is going on right now is not a moderate amount.
---
I missclicked to Thorium Point yday by mistake on friday and it was insane. I obviously died instantly and there were concentric circles of horde down the slope and it took me 4 corpse runs to revive and HS out. I often read in guildchat how it took people 30min to get to brd.
---
Not really new. Played from Wrath launch to Warlords of Draenor launch, but I'm fairly new the classic WoW style of things. When I first started, everything was amazing. Rolled a pally as ret and really enjoyed 1-30 in the human zones. Duskwood and Westfall were amazing fun. Westfall caught me with the Defias questline and Deadmines. Duskwood got me with the Abercrombie quest line and Stitches. Very much enjoyed group questing through these zones when it was needed, as I brought a good mix of damage, healing, and defensive utility. Then Stranglethorn hit.
---
I'm on a heavy-horde server as an Alliance character and caught STV around the time when most people were hitting late 30s and early 40s, so I was behind the curve by about 7 levels. Horde were everywhere an there simply were not enough Alliance to combat them. I still had fun as I was still able to group up and complete some quests, but at a very slow rate. I don;t think I've done most of the quests there, yet. Ended up supplementing the quests with Scarlet Monastery, which was still a rough travel for Alliance with the plaguelands and horde territory in the way. But it worked out and I got a few pieces of the scarlet set. Because of STV I fell behind on leveling substantively. I was just starting 40s and most of my friends and guildies were in their late 50s. 
---
Because of this, I greatly enjoyed leveling from 40-60, as most of the horde left over were the kind souls who also got ganked a lot while leveling. Sometimes, we'd help each other out, have honorable fights to the death, or just wave and go on with our lives. Sometimes there was normal pvp, my theory being that these horde were the alts of people who already hit 60. I finally hit 60 while helping a paladin friend finish his epic mount quest in scholomance. 
---
Now that Phase 2 is out, I have very little reason to play, as I joined a raiding guild, switched to holy (which will be a huge problem later), and I cleared MC after just a few weeks of being carried. Now that we are growing and I have a little bit of gear, I'll be expected to bring potions, aqual quintessences, and fully-enchanted gear. I tried to get the AQs, and ran into a warlock at the lake in EPL. He killed me after he incapacitated me with his demon, reisted my stun and my holy shock, and just let his dots kill me slowly. Any time I tried to heal, he'd fear me or incapacitate me again. Luckily I respawned and killed him the second try. Killed a couple of the elementals and a group of 5 horde killed me and camped my corpse. Spent 20 minutes getting a group together, but only found 2 other alliance willing to help. Tried to fight back, failed, and just left the game for the day. Came back the next day and the lock is still there, killing those elementals, and an alliance in general chat asking for a group to help him kill a horde group camping him at the lake. Light's Hope Chapel is also horde-controlled 24/7 due to horde killing the Flight Master and killing any alliance that land. I'm giving it a few more days to blow over, but the imbalance during phase 2 has me so demoralized.
---
End game dont give a fuck what your spec.. plus we love shaman.
---
If you zone into a fresh MC with a raid group, then leave before they clear any bosses, are you still locked out for the week?
---
lol is this from hive from emerald dream?

---
Faction transfers are coming guaranteed \#changes
---
Agreed, friend.
---
Dont pop fire prot potions imho. The fight is easy for healers.
---
25% stun resist vs twink pally that no one will be making? Ok! Sounds good!
---
Huh, none of these things happen in PvP..  would not recommend lock for beginners, most keybindings alone makes it a tough road.
---
Grobbulus
---
If you were burnt out before people started using p2 as a thiny veiled excuse for griefing.. you're going to be burnt out again tbh :(
---
Nope! Looking at the other comments, it looks like those people don't play on grobb.
---
Grob is the closest to a 50/50 high pop PvP server. From what I've heard, it's also a *little* higher pop than the "high pop" servers back in vanilla, but far less than herod/faerlina. WPvP on grob is actually great and pretty healthy. Sure, there are gank squads roaming around; but they're evenly distributed on both sides so no one really has overwhelming area control and no one needs to go out of their way to find good PvP. People camp areas like light's hope and BRM, but it's a tossup of which faction controls it at any time. It's great, and what WPvP *should* be.
---
Since the WPvP at 60 is so good, people don't really feel like they have a ton of reason to camp lowbies and grief. There's some trolling of menethil harbor, but just like there's trolling of grom'gol. All in all, if you are going to be on a high pop PvP server, grob is *the best* one that you could have picked.
---
Yeah I've been looking at logs for the past couple hours now, there is definitely definitely a reduction in the penalty between 300-305, but beyond that I doubt it does anything for them. None of the theories I've seen posted get it entirely right, which is what was making me hesitant.
---
It's hard to get a good sense just looking at logs because few people raid with 300 weapon skill for more than a week.
---
GM responded to my ticket. He said he had to intervene to fix the "Yesterday honor"
---
So yeah, confirmed. There is also this issue.
---
I wouldn’t bother.
---
Grobbulas is the most balanced server in all of classic. Have fun!
---
I’m pretty sure neutral goblin towns won’t defend you unless you’re at least friendly with them.
---
Agreed. I hope people will come back once bgs come out.
---
Amazing idea!
---
When the grinding gets you down, hop on a gryphon to my to town. In the land of ice and snow, it's always Christmas time in Dun Morogh.
---
There is debate on that.
---
One of the warriors in the dueling tournament has done well with hand of rag.
---
It's fun topping heal meters and making priests wonder if they're good for anything but dispel. utilizing totems makes it a bit more interesting.
---
Isnt BG alliance favoured cause palladins? So horde will get long queue plus lose most bg matches.
---
You sweet flower child.
---
I use addons. Always had. But you my dear are definitely an idiot. From the little I've read of your pathetic "I need to be right" posts I reckon your IQ is probably around 70 or something. A miracle you're still alive.
---
Learn to PvP etc :/
---
Ofc, i want everything before wotlk too
---
Aditionals, mobs that help the main target
---
Having watched the dueling tournament, warriors often only hit their opponent a handful of times anyway, so the damage proc from rag has been more useful.
---
It is not worth it in pvp or pve. In pvp there are just better uses of your talents and in pve you should really never use it anyway as threat is awful for shadow as is.
---
tldw: lucky death ray hits from engineering
---
As a Troll Hunter, is it worth it for me to use Ancient Bone Bow over Dwarven Hand Cannon for raiding? How much hit does the +5 bow skill add?
---
If I can use the bow and drop some of my shitty hit gear, does that make it an upgrade despite the fact that it's technically a slight DPS downgrade?
---
I honestly have a hard time staying committed to one character right now. I have a lvl 32 rogue and now I'm leveling a lock with a mage on the side. Leveling kind of loses it's touch on me after awhile, especially around the mid game levels. Any advice on those?
---
You might think you do, but a vast majority of MC fights don’t require you to move, and that little movement time can be used for applying corruption.
---
Lights Chapel was under alliance control last night along with the jadefire run in felwood but horde had the toxic horrors. It was sort of mutual in felwood it felt lol.
---
People like you transform Reddit topics into shit, it's similar to P2 rogues, shit posts like yours are everywhere and always preset.
---
I've got 3 alliance characters stuck in the 30-40 range.  I kept thinking maybe the class was boring so tired another, but on the alliance side it just seems like such a slog 30+.
---
Go retail

I'm playing Horde on a pvp server. Today's experience was: I joined a group for BRD, got ganked twice on the way to the Black Rock Mountain. 10 Alliance were waiting in front of the BRD entrance, I had to wait 15 minutes or so before I could get in. After the dungeon was done, I HS. From Orgri I tried to take the zep. A druid was killing people at the zep or on the way there. Inside the zep itself there were 6 Alliance killing everyone. I couldn't get in the zep. I did the right thing and stopped playing. Getting to the Scholomance or Stratholme right now is impossible, you'll get killed multiple times on the way (and that's assuming you're being smart about where and when you revive). I avoid neutral cities as much as possible, Alliance mages are killing everyone in the cities themselves, guards are a joke.
---
No, the whole ganking and being an obnoxious piece of shit is not a Horde thing. A minority of people on this sub are pretending like it's only Horde doing it to the good guys in the Alliance but the truth is, it's happening on both sides. A lot of players are shitty person to begin with and a game that allows shitty behavior like Classic is a nightmare.
---
There's dozens of us! Dozens!
---
Yes, of course.
---
The best advice I can give is fuck everyone else. You play this game to have fun. Dont give a shit about anything. Just play the game. You wipe and someone bitches. Boohoo for them,  its them thats getting worked up not you. Dont let their emotions affect you.
---
I left about 3 weeks after launch. Much happier now as a 60 ally on Faerlina. Still leveling my first char on heartseeker with my friends too.
---
Someone got beat by a multiboxer
---
Like why does the Azshara entrance to Timbermaw Hold look like a Lordaeron castle?
---
Nah, a living, warm-blooded human is probably his secret fetish.
---
Can we have non abbreviations for people who dont memorise every item from every class then abbreviate it for very little reason plz?
---
Go to school kid
---
Why not? Everytime I see a multiboxer, its normally free honor for my mage.
---
Git gud
---
Yeah, all you need to do is reroll undead rogue.

Early morning weekends are one of the few times I can get a bunch of solo kills on before the 10+ man groups start roaming around. I got like 3500 or so honor in the morning and I'm missing like half that apparently. HonorSpy has been 100% correct up until this daily reset since I started using it this week.
---
it literally does...
---
Well, if you sit at your auction house and a mutliboxer just rezzed on top of 30 people, spamming arcane explosion with zapper charges. You'd be beaten too.
---
Not everyone wants to do bg all the time especially if youre leveling. Few people all getting ganked on the same quest/area are still gonna group up when bgs are here.
---
My point is, we already have an in-game ability, which sole purpose is to tell us which buffs an enemy player has on him. I don't know about you, but it seems to me that blizzards intention was, that we weren't allowed to see what an enemy player was buffed with, without this ability. The reason we cannot see enemy castbars without a mod, is also because we shouldn't see what he was casting. And we don't have any in-game ability to do so.
---
Because of this, I think mods that show what an enemy is casting is kinda cheating, hence I wouldn't mind it breaking.
---
I just wish we got the good version of AV this time around
---
At least there playing the game while your so desperate you'll sit in queues to feel like you belong. Big rip imo. Even if you remoting in, lol you life just revolves around wow at that point lmao.
---
Man, a server full of carebears would be more enjoyable then one filled with these try hards. There is no competetive WoW, go calm the fuck down.
---
30% of the damage given, ergo a MB crit (1400dmg) would heal you for 420HP.
---
If your Shadow Word Pain deals 270 per tick, it would tick heal you for 81HP
---
Those extra 10% is 1/3, it's quite a lot and will be a life saver.
---
Since swapping forms in a pvp encounter will only drain your mana, so the only heal you can rely on is from this, it's valueable for sure. And only worth 2 points.
---
Nice, constructive reply except that I don't agree the problem is faction imbalance, IMO the problem is server overpopulation, layering should have never happened in the first place.

The nice thing is, as time goes on, you'll find less tryhards while leveling because they plowed their way to 60 while you were enjoying the leveling. I'm currently 54 and I hardly ever run into tryhards anymore. I get people like me that want to enjoy themselves and maximize their fun.
---
I’ve lost all control of my life and now play classic every spare free moment I get.  Good news is, my 60 main rogue has almost all prebis and 2/8 nightslayer, and my 5 mage multibox is lvl 39 and I can afford all their mounts just off what they’ve generated 1-40.

And that's not the way op feels apparently, I can't speak for him but seems to me like he got contaminated by the rush mentality, because he wants to catch up to the people that are in his world of warcraft social group : his friend, his guild, the randoms he's grouping with every day, what sometimes can seem to be the whole server. If you take it slow, you'll never finish catching up and find satisfaction.
---
And I meant weeks of playing 5+ hours a day btw. Weeks of it feeling like a second job, just to catch up. I can empathize with op.
---
"One-shot"
---
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: everybody fucks up at least once.  In my case, many more times than once.  Now it's just funny to me, and I have no problem laughing off the toxic spergs.  Pay them no mind and it's no fun for them anymore.
---
As for tanking, you have to get better somehow.  Usually the douche bags are in the minority, and I've found most people to be helpful, or at least make attempts to improve.  Sadly, the really nasty people stand out like sore thumbs in memory sometimes.
---
FF14 has had player housing since almost the beginning. It’s a fun/neat mechanic, and wouldn’t mind it being implemented in WoW. Housing items would add a whole new dimension to crafting professions.
---
It used to be that, very recently theres been waves of horde guilds transferinng over. I wouldnt say its 60/40. 50/50 is wjat it feels like.
---
Lol they will but not this much anymore. Wpvp is the biggest factors to play on a pvp server.
---
All we want is normal PVP and not PVE  go to retail and stop playing a 15 years old game with a Facebook/Instagram generation mindset. There are plenty modern games for you.
---
What specifically do you want the macro to do? are you talking about using 1 macro for both pets or something else?
---
I play horde on a horde dominated server and it’s still not playable. Gang squads in masses are everywhere. My friend got 57 and quit when he spent an entire day just trying to find a zone to quest in
---
i watched this video 4 times to get those mechanics etc. He haven't cover DHC there. So question is still on)
---
Most people recommend Combat swords for leveling and raiding in endgame. Acquiring decent swords is much easier than other weapons while leveling. And at endgame, your damage in raids is much more than other builds. Something like [this is a standard raiding build.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhecoxZGoVbbVzxro)
---
For PvP, the answer is a lot more muddled. There are a number of good PvP specs for Rogues, and all have usefulness in different types of situations. A decent all-around build is called Cold Blood/Hemo, and might look something [like this.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxb0xtbZhZxMe0chRo) Even within the CB/Hemo build, there are variations you can do depending on your wants and playstyle. I currently use this build and I use a sword on mainhand for higher Hemo damage, and a dagger on offhand for faster poison application. 
---
There are many more PvP builds, so like the other poster said I would recommend some guides and looking things up.
---
Scorch is probably better in pve but I use fireball way more in bgs. Your role in bgs as fire is to stay back and nuke shit which fireball does way better than scorch. You don't have the control at all to run around scorching people in fire you kind of need to blow them up before they take advantage of you having nothing defensive but blink and fucking mana shield
---
As someone with 313 weapon skill I can tell you definitively that you never lose the damage penalty. That's exactly one of the misinformed theories I was talking about in another post. 
---
I average ~10% damage reduction.
---
*50 yards
---
Killing someone during the duration of one stun can be considered a one shot
---
Kromcrush????
---
because only the mage needs to be 60.  the user of the water can be 55+
---
What????
---
It didnt go from 85/15 to 50/50 that quickly that's for sure. The alliance still severely outnumber the horde. 
---
It has gotten better since the horde only transfers but its not gone to 50/50 and most likely not even 60/40.
---
Keep moving those goal posts!
---
The alliance group should br a group of 5 paladins.
---
I play ally on a 40/60 (H60) PvP server. Actually leveling a 34 priest as a reroll. If you avoid high trafic areas like STV and have some sense about where it's gonna be bad (ie. Game experience) it's really OK.
---
Only had to log my main once to clean the road for the alt.
---
also decision to start clipping or not goes from math calculation on rotation cycle and its not like u said - before Rhok’ delar and after Rhok’ delar. It depends on each weapon and i saw that even weapons with same attack speed use to play in different styles
---
All he wants to say is for people like you to spend your cool Snapchat ganking time in a game which is not 15 years old.
---
Believe that would be ‘one stun’ since clearly it isn’t one shot
---
I think Extended Character Stats is what I'm going to use until this gets fixed.
---
Rocking the top like it's 1997 hah!

I've been Horde since I started playing WoW, I didn't pick something new. 
---
Alliance racist, won't even accept your own people either /spit
---
The demographics and interests of the overall pool of people in the market for video games can change just via the addition of new people on top of the old, but that doesn’t mean that the old ever went away or that all new players are casuals.
---
I’m alliance and pvp constantly. I’d play horde if I didn’t have to be a monster or a furry.
---
This is kromcrush for ya . Alliance never come help.  Always all about themselves
---
Yeah, I'm an idiot for pointing out that people who don't use addons are noobs?
---
No, you would not be locked out. 
---
HOWEVER, there is a known bug where this has been occurring, so be very careful about going into instances you don't intend to clear.
---
Yeah the first week i ran around with a few friends circling farms in wpl... changed my ways because honor really isnt worth fucking up someones experience that much. I think the longer honors out the more people will go back to civility... hopefully :p
---
That probably helps ;)
---
This is my main problem with classic, the armor is terrible and no one matches.
---
"Not the best" and "not good" arnt the same thing, you come across as a min max elitist prick.
---
&gt; just find a group
---
Ok so still ruin the social aspect. 
---
&gt; the aids that is LFG
---
Never had a problem with LFG channel being aids in the 13 years I've played WoW, and definitely no problems on Classic.
---
When this happens: Go to processes in task manager, right click "windows explorer" (maybe its just explorer, cant remember) and hit restart. Sometimes it just goes all stupid and refuses to be behind anything, this way is faster than rebooting. It just restarts the windows UI essentially.
---
ok whiner
---
Damn Ret pallys are a meme. Even the top tier top geared Ret pally will have the DPS of an average geared average skill warrior most of the time.
---
the fire ele mobs in MC can drop them in stacks of 5-6, you should always try to spam autoloot those mobs
---
the gain of the 20% in your example is still to small
---
also ve isnt a stable heal in pvp situations
---
Children of Blizzard, nothing else to say. That's what happens to you when Blizzard brainwashes you year after year.
---
Yeah, the gems are a part of the previous questline. The next quest he gives you comes with the items.
---
Idk that hes advocating Blizzard /should/ do that, just that if they did, you wouldn't be able to escape WPVP by being on a different server.
---
Yeah. The majority of the devs that worked on vanilla have left Blizzard. Blizzard has grown too big to pull off another great MMO.
---
Its obvious they wont just act like D3 never existed. At the same time they are bringing back a lot of features D3 culled, so I am cautiously optimistic it will be a good mix.
---
Get perfected by frost mages and rogues day in and day out for a while on your way to Blackrock Mountain and then get back to us about whether that's how the game is supposed to be.
---
150 mana from Tuber, 96 mana per minute from Nightfin, your math is off. Tuber also gives .17% crit chance which means I'd prefer it over Nightfin on all but the longest of fights anyway.
---
Asking around is not really a good source. People will say anything to make you think its balanced in hopes you make a horde character on the server. 
---
And the realm population websites are either super dated from before heartseeker got bad or they are warcraft logs sites that show 80/20 currently.
---
I have ls on mine too, it procs all the time, I've tried sader and it doesn't proc a lot at all.

So butthurt cause bad :')
---
Hi quick question.
---
I am looking for an addon that automatically upgrades my skills in my skillbar when I learn a higher rank of it.
---
Does anyone know an addon that does this?
---
Breakfast!
---
I am bad
---
Wrong. Heartseeker.
---
Grobb is one of the PvP servers that skews alliance rather than horde. You’ll be good on there.
---
How does hit chance work in pvp
---
idk. Took me almost 1hour and a half to get into DM east last night, as horde
---
If someone half my level chunked me to 80% health through 1 stun I'd probably just stand there in shock too
---
&gt; it's nauseating.
---
I've never used VR but I've heard that's the biggest problem and why it will never pick up.
---
Doubt.
---
Simply because all drops are higher with tougher mobs.
---
Common sense would say: the weapon is good and in game money is there for that, so there's no point not crafting it.
---
That's probably because they thought a level 36 wasn't a threat.
---
So I’ve been playing this game for 15 years and just figured out that int gives 15 mana, not 10.
---
But you didn't give him a unique name.
---
Can you farm BRD with 3 modestly geared lvl 60s?

Seems a lot of people love the 30/0/21 mix. Has anyone here stuck with enhancement past lvl 40 or is ele the best, most viable build? I never played as a shammy in vanilla/classic. I am currently lvl 37 as an enhancement shaman and love it. It sounds like it's worth it to swap to ele at lvl 40. Is enh really bad past lvl 40?
---
...
---
Don't play PvP server as alliance is my tip.
---
Mine fixes if I just mouse over it
---
Typical hypocritical mods. I made a post the other day calling out someone for breaking TOS and this kind of stuff is allowed with the persons name. Ridiculous.
---
if I get locked to a raid ID that say kills the first 3 bosses of MC, am I truly locked into my unique raid or is a raid ID more just the general progression. So lets say theres two groups clearing MC that both kill 3 bosses, if my group never gets back in MC the rest of the week but i get a spot in the other group, can I still progress with them or would I never be able to sync into their raid ID?  I guess what im saying is a raid ID unique to just bosses killed, or is it an actual instance that i could never cross even if other group is cleared exact number of bosses I had... does that make sense?
---
I said this goes out to all my people on lockdown. All the people on the streets.
---
Hey I'm on Herod, total newbie, and people have been saying the pop ratio is super skewed? Where are you finding that information (I'm just very curious!)
---
“pVp HaPeNeD oN a PVp sErVeR”
---
HoJ becomes stronger the better your gear is, especially weapons. If I recall correctly the extra swings also generate rage, which translates into another heroic strike (which is also worth more if your gear is better ofcourse), while the trinkets flat 20 AP won't scale past your crit chance.
---
Also I hope you hitcap in some other way when you swap trinkets? Seeing how hit cap is an enormous dps increase, especially for a warrior
---
I’m pretty positive that Facebook and Instagram are two different generations
---
it says at the start that there is an explanation at 4 min something .... what
---
Blizz couldn't make a game as good as vanilla if they tried. I think current wow team doesn't know what makes the game so good.
---
Besides irl experience there was a site listing the ratios not exact but close can’t remember
---
Yeah that’s the one thing that super impressed me about Alliance on stalagg. You guys are so organized. Even though you’re outnumbered it still takes us forever to get our shit together to mount a decent push. It’s super annoying at times. But bravo to you guys for being coordinated.
---
Even if it dropped a lot with BFA, I hope that they still have more than 2m subs
---
How do you have that shop button? I don’t have that.
---

---
Option 1: an inferior weapon that cost 50 arcanite bars
---
Option 2: a better weapon that doesnt cost 50 arcantite bars
---
Ding dong the witch is dead
---
Our retirement pally is our GM and he got the first hand of rag on our server
---
What's crazy is a couple days ago, it was 45/55 pop split at 60 on Herod. Do you guys just not group and push? 
---
I see people mention getting jumped at FP as soon as they land. You cant group up and flank them from another direction?
---
“Horde Rogue likes ganking people. This and other news at 11pm.”
---
I'm on grobbulus. What is Uber?
---
Yo! Where do you find those rankings? Cheers!
---
I agree with you. But there are those would disagree and say it's the "charm" of classic.  
---
What they dont understand is that it also means that some gear is fear you'll be wearing doe the rest of classic, especially if you're not doing a main tier spec (like ret paladin or enhancement shaman)
---
Only 2 ganks? I corpse run 6-7 times as an alliance rogue to get into brd
---
oh. why sm/ds?
---
im sm/ruin right now. honestly i was even struggling on hydrospawn
---
Just because someone advertised that their run is gonna kill boss X doesn't mean they are going to kill boss X? That's a new one. The simple fact is your saying join the group I'm putting together to kill Jed and rend and then acting surprised when people are pissed you don't have Jed... Keep being an entitled fuck and expecting people to do runs with nothing they need just to help you get your gear see how many casters and healers run with you...
---
Also don't forget shadow resist pots, Ony scale cloak, and different types of wands for the dragon guys after Broodlord as well as Chromaggus. Also a good idea to have restorative pots for Chromaggus
---
&gt; escape
---
And make it worse? They should be incentivizing Horde to leave (if high pop) or Alliance to join (if low pop). In no circumstance should the lower pop be allowed to leave, that hurts the server overall.
---
Onyxiareset dot com. Zg and aq20 will be on 3day timers
---
We know it'll come in "early 2020," according to a recent Blue post.
---
Honestly, knowing Blizzard, that might mean the first or second week of January.
---
Horde, makes sense. What 50/50 server are you on?
---
Played wod for 2 months before classic. Thankfully I remember almost nothing from WoD. I know retail was super overwhelming and classic had a real smooth start since you started from lvl1, not 110. Can't really not know how to play your class once you are 60.
---
Ya, I just didn't expect to have 7 dps warriors in raid
---
Noone would still be playing if we were capped to level 26 right now.
---
true, depending on class, spec and what gear you want but the key thing here is that its not like you need full bis to join your guild MC or onyxia raid. its so fucking easy it doesnt matter what youre wearing if you only got to 60 recently cause your raid group will carry you
---
I had a 19 paladin twink during wotlk, it was great, pretty much the best flag carrier. 
---
I don’t remember if they had all these abilities in classic but: 
---
You’ve got Bubble, which didn’t make you drop the flag, lay on hands, can heal and most can’t interrupt you, 8 second HOJ stun, Freedom of movement which would remove snares. 
---
If you can get your hands on the arena grand master, you’re looking at about 2k health passively, and if you use all your cool downs it’ll take about 8-10k if damage to kill you.
---
An extremely annoying quest too. You get a disguise buff which lasts 30 minutes to do an escort that lasts 10-15. So you run to the escort mob and have to log out if he’s not there to keep your buff and log in every few minutes to see if he’s up while others are doing the same thing.
---
haha same.
---
Only positive comments but negative votes lol.
---
Absolutely this. 
---
Get something with ryzen + vega. 
---
Vega 8 integrated graphics are pretty much even with a 1050ti or a rx560.
---
We  had a cat post last week getting 500 likes, nobody cared, someone posts a cake, everyone is outraged.
---
Sm for siphon life and ds to sacrifice voidwalker. It's impossible to sustain your hp without that spec.
---
It is not about simple green and wild with occasional towns. Darnassus is relatively young settlement, but feels like ancient city that stood thousand of years. All thouse tree houses architecture and stone pillars create perfect harmony between short living and almost ethernal.
---
I am glad I have it back for now untill Horde burnes it all to ashes.
---
Really wicked style you have. Very noce work but also the colour tones are just .. fun? Full of their own heartbeet snd energy? Just awesome
---
I don't know if he is OK but he is right.
---
Yes
---
You should be selling prints. And to blizzard :)
---
Ah I didn't know that I thought it was raid wide as long as they are in range.
---
Blizzard actually had an idea for this sometime before Vanilla's release, but they scrapped it because you could build your house in front of major city entrances and make it impossible for people to get around them
---
In retail tmog is just about mandatory.
---
We have a 'non-transmog' purist in our guild. And it turns out when all your best loot is just titanforged dungeon loot, you're gonna look like a freshly dinged scrub no matter what.
---
Faction queues are inherently racist and punish people who wouldn't be griefing you currently. 
---
The answer is to incentive the dominant faction to leave (if the server is too populated) or the lesser faction to transfer IN (if the pop is too low). 
---
Telling me I cant level, because of my race, despite paying the $15 the other faction does, is inherently racist.
---
(X) Doubt
---
I played paladin before I rerolled horde (which was and is probably still be the  less populated faction on my current server, it was like 46/54 H/A ish when I switched) , when I played my paladin during the dark ages of rampant layer abuse, I was still just as aggressive as I am now. 
---
Paladins weren't as good at ganking as horde, sure. But just throwing out a random stun at some unfortunate hordes that were fighting 2 mobs almost always got the job done. Or even buffing up the alliance rogues with BoF so they could actually fight mages.
---
We had 2 SGC drop before HoJ.
---
Its cause those heavy fondant cakes taste horrible
---
I like to work on my professions when I get to that point. Leveling fishing, cooking or whatever your primary professions are can be a lot of fun. It allows you to take a break from the leveling but still keeps you in the world to do some more exploring. Plus, you'll want some cash for that sweet mount at 40.
---
AGM has dodge chance not hp in classic.
---
You're thinking of the Herod drop "Ravager?"
---
ITT: All the salty players that got killed in this video apparently
---
~~Small typo it's not 1-(.85^5 ) Its (1-.85)^5 or just .15^5~~
---
Fuck off with this SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTT
---
You're thinking of ravager from sm armory. Whirlwind axe is a warrior quest reward.
---
Heartseeker is 80-20 Alliance dominated. That's what happens when you give the option for alliance to transfer off of horde dominated servers.
---
I think he's confusing the whirlwind weapon with the axe from SM, the ravager?
---
What realm are you on?
---
Uhh no it’s not. I have a 60 orc hunter on heartseeker. Orgrimmar has turned into IF/SW 2. I literally die any contested zone I fly into within 1 min. Currently unplayable for horde. It feels like 85/15. Can’t wait for BGs to come out
---
Yeah, the longest time interval I'd expect for a "one-shot" would be one GCD from when you actually begin landing damage.
---
Yeah someone said level 36 weapon and "whirlwind" axe. Figured ravager was a pretty solid assumption
---
Wouldn't pendulum of doom be even better?
---
You're mixing up the warrior weapon with the sm armory weapon.
---
Oh true about the rage. But you'd also get more rage by hitting for more dmg (crit or str/AP) so it feels like an even trade off? I think you're right that at top tier gear it's amazing. I'm mostly testing pre-raid BiS weapons too.
---
Yea I'm just assuming I'm hit capped in all of these tests (via other gear).
---
That’s a completely different axe that drops from Herod in SM....
---
Great comment
---
That's Ravager, not Whirlwind Axe.
---
Silithus is empty so probably your best bet. There are some undead ghosts on the frozen lake near everlook that have low health and are great for xp grind but winterspring seems to be PvP heavy these days
---
Honestly, this is becoming the norm. It is bad enough to have to deal with the overwhelming Horde population, but fighting with our own faction is becoming more common. They won't even understand that if the game dies, it is mostly their fault.
---
Technically, yeah, but that's a twink weapon that usually goes for like 500+ gold. And gets replaced by Stoneslayer / Rockpounder, so it's bad for leveling.
---
Classic Tunawiggle, amirite?
---
The discussion wasn't about DHKs but honorless targets aka gray levels.
---
https://imgur.com/a/8aFjqtM we pushed them back, now alliance owns the BRD on Zandalar Tribe :D but not for long
---
whirlwind axe doesn’t have a whirlwind effect. You’re thinking of the ravager.
---
Not gonna lie....this isn’t as cool as I thought it was going to be.
---
Yeah, the moderation here is incredibly uneven.
---
1. some people incorrectly think that killing grey players give DKs, not sure why this persists, but it was a weird rumor back in vanilla too. 
---
2. a lot of people don't bother wasting mana/energy/time killing someone that won't return an HK.
---
Ah didn’t realise that, but that rings a bell now.
---
There were rogues who would stack agility, double agm, +15 agility on each weapon (probably assassins blade, which I think had +3/4 agility anyway) and meadow rings of eluding which also gave +12 dodge.
---
Thinking about it I think their passive dodge change was like 50-60%. And if you decked out a lower level (say, 10 for maximum conversion or 17 for meadow rings) it was even higher.
---
Its only 5%, its not very consistent.
---
Bro you are wrong. Heartseeker is like 80/20 alliance. I have a 60 orc hunter. Orgrimmar is currently like another alliance capitol. Almost unplayable for horde atm.
---
And inferior to WW axe outside of cleave groups.
---
You can also buy then although it will get expensive in the long run.
---
So its not hard just time consuming?
---
I think it’s more the piss poor attitude and labeling it a “meme weapon” that’s causing you problems mate, not the logic.
---
The Whirlwind axe doesn't  whirlwind though. That's the Ravager from SM. WW axe is the warrior quest.
---
As someone killed in the video, I spammed Death Coil when he stunned me and I realized he might actually be up to something but couldn't cast it before I died.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
When I switched to it like a month or 2 ago, it had about 46/53 H/A ratio.
---
Census are broken now (by Blizzard) but I have not had any indicators that it has gone to shit, and from my experience every zone has been very heavily contested by both factions.
---
Thorium Point is the worst access point. Why haven't people realized this?
---
We have very different interruptions of what being One-Shot means.
---
Very cool video, that's awesome. Shitty click bait title tho.
---
Is 10 % discount on all goods ? Cause it doesn't seem so for cooking mats like soothing spices etc
---
When I switched to it like a month or 2 ago, it had about 46/53 A/H ratio.
---
Should be fine, just be careful because the mobs will still do damage to you so dont try and zerg pull everything. Have people stand far back but also remember there are pats that spawn in certain parts who will sneak up behind you. You have no taunt or anything so if someone is healing you just be careful about them pulling adds.
---
he's probably mixing up the whirlwind axe with the axe from SM armory that does the whirlwind thing
---
Sweet dude. I’m sure you can’t wait to 2 shot all the undergeared lowbies
---
Mah man. Give em hell bois, in the name of the light!
---
Have you tried comparing HoJ with your other trinket?
---
Oh I didn’t realize that wasn’t a YouTube video, my b.
---
Was great when that happened and my party mates just asked me if I actually just died to a level 36. 
---
Additional info: I'm the guy at 1:30, as soon as he stunned me I started spamming Death Coil thinking that something was up but it obviously didn't work and even though it looks like the stun ran out I couldn't cast anything before I died.

They camp the flight path and it’s like 5 vs 40+ every where there are always like 4 to 5 of them per one of us and at this point people have just stopped playing tbh can’t do shot outside of dungeons once you get there
---
Oh I do think the weapon is a meme, because it is much rarer and more expensive to obtain, than an epic weapon that drops off of the same boss which outperforms it. That's the meme. The joke, if you will. 
---
You are still wrong about the pvp aspect, though; mace spec is so much worse than sword spec, that it is not worth using in pvp on a warrior - unless you were using a blue weapon or the Magmadar mace or something equally bad beforehand. BRE, OEB and SR are all better pvp weapons than HoR.
---
You have to suck so fucking much if you can't farm with that gear
---
again, I never called it a meme weapon.  I feel like you're responding to the wrong person.
---
Blue bar bad, red/yellow bars good.
---
Foh
---
I don't get it. Is he mad that you wanted to heal him?
---
Yeah the last time I upgraded anything that wasn't a weapon was 40, apart from a few drops and quest rewards
---
2xDB is obviously better. Fucking Dal'Rends are on par with it with edgemaster's/as human. But BRE is not, no, not for a non-human. It is, however, much better for pvp.

The popular culture is people trying to emulate 2004 era elitist gamer culture without the deep understanding of game mechanics that was part of the culture. That's why you get people who are obsessed with acquiring items from BIS lists yet fail to enchant their gear.
---
Can confirm something is not adding up. Honor Spy estimated that I’d be at 53041 total for the week after this mornings daily reset. Ended up with 48999 which is a huge discrepancy of 4042 honor. I do PvP during early hours of the day as well.
---
Also, I remember looking at my combat log landing damage on players and no HK was notified.
---
you need the X.
---
red is more visible + you can aim at your enemys with it.
---
*talks shit about title*
---
*thinks interruptions means interpretations*
---
Why even bother if they dont get honor.
---
&gt;Sword &gt; Axe.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;BRE is the best coordinated PvP weapon until the end of classic.
---
&gt;SR does not crit for 1.8k MS on warriors.
---
You would rather have Ashkanki over Dark edge in PvP? The 5% chance for an extra hit just isn't consistent enough for me. Bumping your crit from 22% to 27% will give you mugh high overall output in pvp.
---
Just tank strat live orbs res. Should get enough orbs to pay for your  epic mount in 15 runs
---
*sees a warrior 24 levels below me*
---
"aight I'mma head out"
---
What does this mean? I typically thought it was just someone across the globe playing
---
That’s crazy!  In vanilla, we raided MC weekly for a year and a half and the eye literally never dropped once.  I had the hammer crafted and waiting but couldn’t create the legendary until around cata or so.
---
Weapon skill does a lot more than reduce your soft cap on hit. You'll lose a lot of raid DPS doing that
---
There are multiple points where if you just CS the poly you win. Specifically, I’m referring to just after your reset at around 2:10, and as he is running and you finish the grenade cast instead of CSing despite being in range. He is OOM and already burned his mana CDs. There’s no reason to hold CS for the frost lockout.
---
oh god what a fucking asshole
---
I reported him for being a soundphobe
---
And when it does a Shaman wins it saying they’re respecing to Enh.
---
So balanced.
---
I'm taking that spec but with Furor instead of Improved MotW. Being able to shift to bear and instantly stun is more important to me than  +4 stam/int/agi/str that will probably get dispelled off me.
---
There are more Horde players (like all PvP servers), but Alliance have awesome guilds and fights back too. I love the server.
---
You having an Internet hissy fit isn't going to get this nerf undone. Kinda cringe to be honest.
---
I would like to see them take a similar route to OSRS. Have new content added to Classic that was not added in the retail version of the game. Keep it classic but add newer content, not TBC. Would be more interesting than having the same content added over time.
---
rogues in classic are just happy to have a group that's why :P
---
Yeah I get that, but gow would one be punished for killing s grey target?
---
No
---
Before the nerf - the range was longer than visual range. Please educate yourself on the topic you are "attempting" to discuss.
---
You get negative honor right?
---
Woof. I'm horde on Herod lol. They're still offering free transfers to us so that makes sense now
---
I would argue most think ages 20-29 are the sexiest twinks
---
Nope only for civilians. Just no honor for gray players
---
Tell that to the tens of thousands of people that camp low levels for the lols.
---
It works very well for a target list and KOS list. However, its significantly weakened against Rogue players. Most worthwhile Rogues are going to enter stealth far, far outside of the measly 50 yard range. At which point, Spy does nothing for you.
---
I make the mistake of getting bored and reading new posts. I've done a lot of work researching the game so I like to give new people advise. But it gets me caught in the less savory threads because I read them.
---
Glad I could give you a little window into my playtime :)
---
Did you expect him to just hit really hard or something? He's level 36
---
Not totally "new" I guess, but I was like 11 when I played classic and remembered zilch and haven't touched real WoW in years.  I went in expecting it to be hard and require a lot of grouping up, but surprisingly it wasn't like that at all.  Leveled as feral at first, then stuck with balance.  I solo'd pretty much everything outside of dungeons unless it was a quest dealing with several elites and had fun exploring out on my own + dungeoning.
---
I love healing and basically healed off-spec when doing dungeons.  Most of the time it went without issue, but as dungeons got harder and players got... weirder it just got too stressful. I got my druid to level 47ish and then finally accepted that I can't stand not having a normal rez.  It's just too much pressure in higher level dungeons to not screw up AND hope that no one else in your party screws up like a psycho warlock hellfiring themselves to death or a mage that blinks into mobs to frost nova and blizzard them then gets wrecked by a horde of enemies when tanks can't get aggro.  Followed by "where were the heals? rez?" before they leave the party.
---
I hate melee dps/tanking so I dungeon'd purely as Boomkin for a couple of levels which was fun. No one turned me away from a dungeon either, and groups never complained/kicked me out (and I got lots of "dance for us!!" comments), but my DPS on my meter was usually 1-2/3 of what others were doing with a heck of a lot more work - two ten minute buffs to constantly refresh on myself and one on the tank, tab moonfire spam between auto-attack hits for omen of clarity proc, barkskin then hurricane on OoC, starfire on OoC, brez when an oops happen, innervate when an oops happens.  Just too much when other classes can sit there and hit three buttons while watching Netflix.  So after 12 days of playtime spent on a character I won't use, I took a hiatus from the game a month ago.
---
Thinking maybe I'll try it again as a pure DPS class when battlegrounds come out so I don't have to deal with people or overly tedious gameplay.
---
These are the people that ruin servers tbh. Carebares are the best because they will jump in and help you out even to their own detriment. I see a friend [same faction are all my friend] getting attacked, I full throttle in even if it's a 5 v 1. I will die and take durability damage with them until we manage to get away or they decide to log. All this, and I don't even know them. How ever everyone seems to know who I am and I get told ty a lot in Org when I come into town, and even by randoms in the road. One dude stopped me to try and give me 10s [all he had on his alt] because I saved his main from a horrible gank fate [shamans op] and escorted him with his half broken gear back to town, and tossed him a 50% on his repair bill. 
---
I don't expect payment in any other form but aid when I need it.
---
One proposes punishments (like DHK's I assume) for killing lowbies, to which another answered that wouldn't work because people would make raids of lowbies and go kill high levels that can't fight back unless they want to get punished.
---
Oh definitely. I've loved the game community. It's just the people who come to reddit (as a whole of course).
---
Thanks for doing that testing btw.  I’m subbed on YT.
---
Wrong game big dog.
---
Mage has prob the most instant cast moves of any class
---
When the option is between transferring and quitting, you'd think they'd rather keep getting that sub money instead of not at all.
---
The fuck?
---
Back in retail vanilla, we used everything we could just like today.
---
This is amazing lmfao
---
How many deaths does it take alliance to get into BRM on average for PVP servers? Because the 10 it takes me seems a little ridiculous
---
It has a lot to do with vanilla being 'solved' too. 
---
When all the information on every item, instance, and mob that will make it into the game already exists, it's a lot harder to justify blissful ignorance.  As much as I'd like to pretend I don't know my upgrade progression for the entire life of the game, I do.  If you know every boss mechanic for bosses that won't be out for a year, being informed becomes the expectation, and when anonymous people underperform each other's expectations it can result in ridicule and even breed hostility.  
---
The simple fact that we're playing a rerelease of a 15 year old game inherently creates more elitism than a new game ever would.
---
I have no idea what’s going on but holy shit do I love it haha, well done!
---
They're probably doing it that way to avoid getting DHK's.  If you push too deep into a city or town, somebody in your raid is going to AOE tag a civilian.
---
Honestly I recommend retail but do the questing until max level to enjoy it or just play classic. Mindlessly running through dungeons in retail to get to max level has got to be one of the most boring aspects of the game. It's about the journey, not the destination.
---
Ogres in deadwind pass
---
Every class on horde side on a pvp server  is what you a looking for. You can enjoy every aspect of the game unless you are more of a spiritual guy, who wants travel the ghost world then go alliance and enjoy your corpse marathon

---
I mean, it's not *entirely* unique to reddit. Before reddit existed, this type of community existed very much on forums instead.
---
I think what makes reddit slightly worse is the downvoting system. It adds an ability to spite someone, and gives other unhappy users a target to aim for when they realize other people also dislike what they said.
---
see, these fools be down voting me. I was once a wielder of the reaver.
---
Thats not elitist at all. Getting pre raid bis except the few rare epics and 2-3% drop rate items is easy. 
---
Expecting people to just slightly care about their gear and farm the easy parts of the preraid bis is not elitism.
---
Honestly go sword with oeb for pvp. Try go farm hoj. Wf+hoj+sword proc. U will absolutely melt people.
---
It's not even one stun, he stuns with a move and then with some goblin rocket or something afterwards.
---
Exactly. Very down for that.
---
Happy cake day :)
---
I get into pug raids no problem as a feral druid DPS as well. Just need to state that you aren't utter shit and you'll probably get in.
---
Retail is garbage. Classic is a better game but the community isn’t the same as it was in the day
---
Attack power ret is &gt; spell power ret until AQ40 because of lack of gear right now
---
I actually think paladins are great for farming, yeah they don't do massive damage but you use plate armor and you have healing spell. Include bandages and blessing of wisdom and you can tackle 3/4 mobs before you really have to stop and eat/drink
---
Hit chance is similar to pve hit chance only in pvp your weapon skill is always maxed for your level.
---
Totally down for that as well.
---
Yeah it's alot different PvP than PvE. I noticed hard on my shadow priest. At 52/53 I could down 58/59's sometimes easily when I'd hit that 1400 MB Crit. But against dark red mobs my hit chance felt next to nothing
---

Technically we don't know that all of these, or any of these, enemies are level 60.  They have a skull for their level, so could be as low as level 46.
---
&gt;  If they could somehow find a way to balance that
---
I really don't see how that could be done in a neat way.
---
But one thing needs to be recognized first and foremost. Flying creates its own issues but people tend to just lump in the act of going from 100% speed mounts to **310**% speed (flying) mounts. That's a massive deal in an of itself. Flying wouldn't diminish the game as much if they were kept to the 70% speed increase of the regular variant.
---
I'm of the opinion that mounts should be used for travelling. Not for moving 20 yards from one mob to the next. With epic flying mounts people were never on the ground unless they were actively performing an action and the second it's done you mount up again.
---
I have as many if not more fond memories of BC as I do classic.
---
the devs knew as little about itemization as the players when they first implemented all this mc gear.
---
Classic warcraftlogs
---
What's the combo? Death ray and sapper charge?
---
It removes roots and snares, both of which can easily be re applied in tbc. Warrior/druid is hardly the most dominant comp in the game, considering disc/rogue, and warlock/druid absolutely destroy them with 0 issues.
---
Arena tournament/next gen were both extremely horde favored servers.
---
Yea but the quality of expansions just kept going downhill and seemed more like a cash money grab.... remember how terrible the panda expansion was? 
---
BC and WOTLK were simply amazing, groundbreaking expansions
---
Relevel? There are free transfers my dude. No one is talking about releveling. We're talking about flipping from being on dominant side to the underdog side on unbalanced servers.
---
But the end result is the same regardless, there will be less Allys for Horde to face no matter if they transfer or quit. I wonder how many people can keep up with the Pay to not Play that's going on several servers.
---
I took a picture on my phone to send to a group text. Putting it on Reddit wasn’t a though at the time. Don’t be a douche.
---
Tell that my friend who didn't learn arcane because Frost mage :)
---
Saw it drop off anger for the first time yesterday after a week of farming!!! I rolled an 8:(
---
Took me about 10 yesterday on Rattlegore-NA. It's stupid.
---
Game is too easy to just play PvE. Have not seen how naxx is yet tho o.O
---
I swear people don't know how to read lmao.
---
Looking to roll warrior. Anyone have a solid talent guide I can follow? Icy veins and wow great don't seem to have one I can easily grab and say this is the one. Looking at arm's leveling
---
Some people don't simply have lives outside this game. What ends up happening for those people, they take the game much more seriously than you average person.
---
Oh, duh! My bad.
---
If you get there first you fish simple. Over seen groups where the person who wants Jed just sits in the jedless ID and qqs about no Jed. How about be a part of the team
---
oh man that sped up UD male dance is triggering me ;\_;
---
also what addon are you using that lets you move your characters unit frame? Im using shadow UF and would rather have the original blizzard art unit frames
---
If only...
---
my feral gear is aesthetic as fuck.
---
Not that anyone ever sees it.
---
I think adding expansion content, but retooling it, might be nice. No reason not to use the already existing maps, models, .etc to keep cost of development down.
---
This is the answer I was hoping to get from people, but everyone wants to take it literal and bitch about addons and screenshots :)
---
&gt;trying to greentext on reddit
---
&gt;shit wait
---
&gt;one shot
---
&gt;combo
---
I don't think you can choose both.
---
Ok they have 3 warriors total. I’m sure they all got it. Don’t act like you don’t know what I’m sayin tryin to turn it around. Casuals are casual. It’s not that rare. The fact that they just started raiding doesn’t make it rare. It just means they are casual and haven’t raided enough to see it yet.
---
Whatever they choose to do, it should somehow require 40 man raids. 20 man raids ruined everything.
---
I'll share a story of mine to show you that mistakes happens, people have to learn and it's completely fine.
---
I am a restoration shaman and about 1 month ago I joined a PUG for MC.  It was my first time EVER in Molten Core since I only played BC &amp; WOTLK (a bit of cata too).  I "knew" most of the strats from YouTube video but it was mostly a fresh experience.  
---
We cleared MC up to Rag quite easily.  I wasn't in the top healers but I was pulling my weight and most importantly I didn't make any major mistake that could be noticed.  
---
Until Rag.  
---
On the first try, I ended up blowing a part of the melee group while trying to walk towards them to refresh totem.  The group isn't pleased and kind of put the wipe on me but what ever it's just one wipe.  On the way back they clearly stated in discord that we shouldn't target rag otherwise it's going to start the encounter.  Since I was responsable for the first wipe and I'm clumsy I just decide to walk into position with my camera pointing the ground to make sure I wouldn't click Rag but I ended up walking in Melee range which also start the encounter. Second wipe and now it was clearly my fault.  On my second walk back I made  sure to RP walk my way to my position.  Everyone was so focused at  starring at me trying to not screw up that they never noticed I was positioned directly on top of the whole melee group.  Guess what? I caused a third wipe and the raid disbanded because of me.
---
The following week I join another PUG for MC and god was I terrified.  I almost had a panic attack before the first boss and I was playing like crap.  After a few boss I got my confidence back and started playing quite well.  So well that the guild that was pugging gave me my first T1 piece and offered me a spot in the guild.  Right now I am 8/8 T1, no1 shaman in the guild, an unofficial officer and considered very skilled by my guild.
---
I only recently told my guild about that first MC raid experience and we laughed it out.  I hope my story will help you overcome some of your fears.  Some people will be asshole no matter what.  Some people are salty and elitist. Fuck em. It's a game.  Nobody knew all the strat from the get go and the game is 3 months old.  I like to push content myself but being new or unexperienced isn't a reason to rage at someone.  If I tell the mage 5x during the dungeon that he need to decurse the tank I might be salty but at this point it's not being unexperienced it's just being lazy/of bad faith. No reason to rage at someone for a lack of experience.
---
Take care friend and if you play on incendius- Horde let me know
---
Lol @ you guys getting world buffs for mc. Sure youre not terrible?
---
But 0/0/0 is a viable spec right now... given guilds are doing speed runs or bringing 30/40 members into raids to gear up faster. (Some are even doing 20ish man onyxia)
---
You don’t take durability loss from dying in pvp combat...
---
No addon needed.  Right click.  Unlock frame.
---
I wanted to level out the negativity and say how awesome it looks. Gave a Christmas present idea!
---
We didn't get an OEB until this week, but BRE dropped last week lol. We've had earthshaker twice.
---
Two bindings also.
---
I understand, but I stood by them the entire time to make sure he wouldn't die.
---
I could've just ran off, but I went in with good intentions. :(
---
Ganking gets pretty annoying when you're just minding your own business. Like I'll hop on for a two hour sesh to finish a level up at 10pm - sike 4 hour sesh because I get corpse camped by honorless people and it's 2am now. But finding another person the same level to 1v1 is insanely fun (until they call their level 60 friend if they're bad), especially playing as a mage. The mindgames that goes on in PVP is something that I really enjoy, but I can't say I'm the biggest fan of "team with the most members wins". Luckily for you and me, we have psychic scream and poly so any fight we don't want to do we can just ignore for the most part.
---
NA is generally filled with a bunch big talkers who regurgitate what they see from the actual top players. This "elitism" can't really bother  me because it's a false sense of it. Watch top EU guilds rank and raid, if you're not emulating them even a little bit, then you're a fake elitist.
---
Thanks for the feedback 😊I think I'll be going back and forth between mage and druid and see which of them I'm better at pvp with lol
---
No they won’t. Thalnos is almost like that and we kick the hordes ass. Pvp problems require pvp solutions. I’m not a casual player though so I don’t give up.
---
Yeah honestly that would be the best case scenario, no classic+/tbc, just wow2
---
sounds like Garrisons....
---
I’ve been doing this since vanilla... I’m not lying to myself. If it’s not for you fine but don’t act like it can’t work for others.
---
I guess I misspoke, he was being ganked because of his durability. He had tried soloing a group quest with his pet and failed quite a few times. Did I say PvP? I need my coffee... 3rd shift us killing me.
---
I run pretty much exactly the same gear with less armor/stam pieces (don't have any good ones yet.) Ban'thok's sash instead of sash of mercy is the only other big difference I think. Kinda want the hit neck as well, fuck root resists.
---
Yes and I dread the "No changes".... Really give ret pala/boomkin /prot pala some love.
---
Just increase
---
Seal of command from 7ppm to 10
---
Judgement mana cost from 77 to 35(with libriam 0)
---
Sancity aura from aura to passiv
---
And the ret paladin would still only make perhaps 500dps and be the worst class
---
I farmed like 85% of it alone then guildies really hooked me up in the end when I got close to finishing
---
Then you misspoke twice, because you first claimed to take durability loss in a 5v1 as well. So you can understand my confusion at you believing you could take durability loss from pvp.
---
That doesn’t mean they are.. i just thought it was odd a hunter had threat over a warlock. It probably depends how long she’s airborne for.
---
I find something like this fun
---
It's the reddit way
---
But we love you for playing heal.
---
Yeah it's a fantastic game. I had a small house that I was obsessed with decorating. You can also collect music to play on a jukebox that in your house. People actually play that game for housing. There is a bigger social aspect to the game, so they invite their friends over to hang out at their house and shit. Really great experience. I play MMOs for pvp, and I'm super bummed that game has terrible pvp
---
Never have an image triggered me more, and I even have BRE.
---
What a waste of rare weapons.
---
You should have a set of fire resistance gear as a caster for firemaw if you want to increase the amount of damage you do.
---
I respect your opinion, I just felt like they were negative additions personally and took away from what I saw was WoW.
---
Me too altho the way people talk its completely anecdotally and unreliably around the 2 mill mark. I know some servers are struggling. My retail guild has been posting everywhere looking for ppl
---
The reason all the hybrid spellpower gear is garbage is it has no crit. Crit is insanely important for ret and there’s no hybrid gear with it till AQ40, at which point it _is_ better than just being a bargain bin arms warrior.
---
If Judgement had crit on it instead of spirit or whatever every ret would be fighting tooth and nail for it.
---
Over all dp logs on warcraft logs
---
And that’s assuming the hardcore guilds only let one person get the scepter.
---
FF11 had Mog Houses too, they got better over time. One of my fav features.
---
Oh jeez I gotta scrap that whole comment it seems, I could have sword I typed in the part about the PvE.
---
The counter argument that every seems to be missing here: Healers don't need any gear from the stuff you want to farm and are done with tanks taking everything. There's an abundance of healers for pugs but in a guild do consider them.
---
Stalagg!!
---
i'd like to interrupt
---
Um, no, no it isn’t. 6% hit is recommended assuming you have 305 weapon skill (as OP is an orc, I assume he is using axes). It’s completely separate from world buffs and completely separate from heroic strike. Yes, if you don’t keep HS enabled you will miss with your OH, but (1) you should just play the spec correctly and keep HS up and (2) your OH damage represents only a small percentage of your overall damage, so stacking more hit to improve it isn’t advisable. If anything, stacking hit beyond the yellow hit cap is more viable *with* world buffs than without, because it increases your crit cap, which with proper gear, consumables, and buffs, you will certainly be hitting.
---
Dodge chance doesn't scale very well in classic, it wasn't until BC that it became viable to stack on a twink.
---
Deathray  has a chance to highroll. Its based on the damage drained but  anything above 200 per tick should be juicy
---
I assume that every post made on this sub (at least in the past 2 weeks) is from a PvP realm since most of the content is about how unbalanced servers are, and post about rage quitting.  
---
I believe blizzard did an intentional language shift and began referring to PvE servers as "normal" to try to remove the stigma attached to "carebears" who don't want to be continuously flattened on PvP realms.
---
You might enjoy retail more
---
He’s an orc. I’m sure he’s using axes.
---
Always wanted to play growing up, a bunch of friends played, the South Park episode made me want to. So I’ve finally got the game and I’m playing classic, I currently have a lvl 24 orc warrior and having tons of fun with it, still learning stuff because I’ve never played an mmorpg so this is my first time in this realm of gaming. Love it! Grinding is real to level though super frustrating at times.
---
What? You’re a warrior, you literally have one caster ability: Slam. Which in most cases you shouldn’t even be using. I’m not sure how you are thinking pvp for a warrior is slow, because it’s not.
---
What doe Ogar translate to at 26 seconds?
---
He specified whelps. As if whelp aggro transfers to ony somehow.
---
Lvled as Enh 1-60 and raiding as Enh. 
---
Enh is beast after 40lvl.
---
Its all about how do you want to level.
---
Dungeons? Get 3x  warrior and some priest for healing it will be awesome 😊
---
Quests? Well as Enh you can simply auto attack and kill everything with lucky WF procs. As Ele you will have to drink every pull..
---
Well not really good = same as "there are better"
---
It takes a debuffslot = very bad for raid.
---
It is an awesome weapon but the cost and debuff slot AND other better weapons kills it for warrior
---
Yoooo!! Thank you bro! I check out your stuff all the time crazy you saw this!!
---
Exactly the same thing happened to me, yesterday I made around 35hks, today I logged and saw that these kills still count as "today", I killed 2 guys and now it shows that I have only 2 kills today and 1 yesterday. Like wtf, where did my 35hks go.
---
thats not a question its a factual statement
---
All the BOE stuff you can just collect the mats and get an engineer from the other side to craft them for a tip.
---
Idk what you are going on about. I’m alliance on rattlegore and it’s unplayable. Every day after 3pm server the horde takes over every lvl 50 zone and camps until about 2-3am server.
---
Earthfury half the time, all the time
---
Iirc there are two sorts of resist when casting. One is for the "missed" spells (affected by spell hit rating) and one is due to resistance to the type of magic casted (affected by spell penetration).
---
Irfanview image viewer
---
Lots of great games from 10, 20, 30 years ago though.
---
Tbf it does ask if you're waiting for SL as well as TBC servers heh.
---
Eh that's fine. I don't get HKs from incessantly tormenting and ganking lower levels anyway.
---
On grobbulus it’s not an issue. That server is pretty balanced
---
r/boneappletea
---
Man I’m level 48 and ya I legit can’t play either . It must be bad for both sides. For what it’s worth I never engage if the enemy is attacking a mob. I can’t say the same for the alliance who encounter me..
---
To be fair, raiders talk about one shotting raid bosses and they obviously don't mean killing them in one hit. It's a fluid term.
---
Oh thank God!  I was worried that husbands, fathers, and office workers were neglecting their wow raiding duties.
---
Lately people are saying "don't play phase 2 is garbage blizzard killed classic with pvp"
---
Duh! That's the reason why I wanted to play classic for pvp. Retail destroyed everything great about pvp. I gotta do mythic +16 to get good gear for pvp? Fuck that shit 😤😡
---
Problem is that blizzard can no longer be trusted to create new content while TBC was proven. Kara alone would make tbc worth it in my eyes. 
---
I understand what that means for the longevity of classic though and  I personally would  be getting off the train after wotlk
---
Just a few general pally tips. Bring symbols of kings, I always bring 300 to mc in case someone forgets also sync up with the other pallies who will provide each blessing.
---
Have fire resistance aura trained and applied, if you are in the wrong party not giving anyone your aura whisper RL or raid assist.
---
Don't die waiting for healing in an intense moment just bubble and throw some heals yourself. Also use the addon healcom, this way you can see who will receive a heal and how big it will be (if the person healing also has healcom).
---
Judgement of wisdom is great for everyone on ony since some raids run out of mana if the fight drags on.
---
Lightning shield recast right before you start combat. Rebuff your highest level weapon buff (I actually just like using flame tongue, consistent damage is nice) if needed.
---
Searing totem &gt; LB &gt; LB &gt; Flame Shock &gt; Auto attacks.
---
The point of finishing casting is to get your MP regeneration going that much earlier, always cast in batches where possible. Avoid using shocks during auto attack fights, if necessary add an extra lightning bolt then a flame shock. Interrupting mana regen = more time drinking.
---
Gear wise just stack int, mail isn't necessary. Use a 1h + shield and you'll have all the tank you need. Ele are getting hit by mobs significantly less often, so they don't need *as* much defense. And just the ability to thrown on a shield is wonderful.
---
Not the person you responded to, but had to comment. Your response is uncalled for, defensive and rude.
---
I've raided in Classic, Ony and MC... and they are right.
---
I'm a druid, I know my value and I run a spec that lets me play a valuable raid role.  Playing ret paladin and thinking it's okay that you do shit dps bc you bring buffs?  
---
That's nonsense when you could do something valuable *and* bring those same buffs.
---
Im on Incendius pvp server, was layered till last day.  I have 36 black lotus and tons of other herbs.  And it’s not like I no-life herbalism.
---
Money is not that hard to make if you put some mind into it.  There are tons of methods that work.  If you see that herbs are being very competitive and not good money, consider dropping it for mining.  If that is a no go, see if there are good mobs to grind.
---
Hell, even running dungeons is some gold per hour.  Sell services, flip items on AH.
---
It’s alright not to have money, if it is not something that matters.  But to complain that 50g is hard to get is simply wanting things handed to you.
---
I'd say it depends on the zone, but usually blue square is more visible for most places unless it's like... Winterspring?
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e113w0/if_you_could_createadd_a_new_class_in_classic/). 
---
I think that guy needs to see a mental health professional. Or maybe someone can explain how  this is mentally healthy behavior.
---
It’s 35% ally and 65% horde or something odd of that. Im tempted to reroll after getting killed 50 times in a 2 hour session. Idk where the fuck all the alliance are but at least they are doing something I guess.
---
for the people hurt the worst by the imbalance they are literally unable to transfer. If your only options are to abandon months of progress and cut ties with all the people you have been playing with to reroll or to soldier on in a server where you cant utilize the overworld you are in a shit situation.
---
woosh
---
I’m on Herod Alliance (were 60:40 horde favored) and I saw almost no difference while leveling below 48
---
ABB is a decent option even if it’s not the best. Using a bow as a troll makes your hitcap go from 9% for 6% vs lvl 63 targets. 
---
Ideally, you’d use Carapace Spine Crossbow from Strat UD, or Bloodseeker from AV once it opens in 2 weeks.
---
So we agree, in this situation, it should have been caught by a quality QA department.
---
I have one too, I think they only apply it on full/high pop servers.
---
I got 12 day1 so in total i should be at 27 &gt; 25. 
---
But Ended on 12.  Was so puzzle like did i dream about day0.....
---
Getting hit by whelps gives a warrior rage.
---
I'm on Skeram alliance and we have a few guilds who will occasionally bring 15-20 people to the gates of IF which is always good fun. 
---
But almost every night, ONSLAUGHT will bring a group of 10-12 into IF and turtle in one of the rooms and it's always high hilarity. I'm sure it's good honor for them because they're organized and will usually wipe out the group of alliance who engage them at least a few times. 
---
But it's always funny for me to watch them corpse run to the exact location they want before they all rez together and fucking explode some poor alliance just running from the mage quarter to the bank. 
---
I'm not sure what ONSLAUGHT's actual reputation is or if they're toxic or not, but they are one of the main sources of balanced pvp for me aside from the slew of UD rogues patrolling IF so I definitely am glad they're on our server.
---
Unless your in tanaris, for whatever reason the alliance dominates that zone
---
nope i did. free EXP
---
Bump
---
I stopped playing retail in 8.x something because BFA just plain fucking sucked. Basically got to 120 and said fuck it!
---
Started playing classic cause it brought me back to what made me  fall in love with wow, and was enjoying the hell out of going slow and just reading the quests, doing the extra lore stuff and enjoying the views.
---
With the announcement of shadowlands and the 8.2.5/8.3 storyline changes (especially sylvanas character development) I went back to retail to basically play catch-up and go through it all and be ready. I'm currently finishing up every lore line and unlocking allied races and flying. Once I get caught up I'll jump back into classic and stay there till shadowlands. 
---
Im honestly torn on tbc classic. I mean tbc was the first and still my favourite xpac to date. I would like to experience it again, but also think classic should stay classic. I think the idea of having seperate classic and tbc classic servers would be the best option, but I doubt Blizzard will go that route.
---
so creepy, how will i sleep at night without my nightlight
---
Icy veins my friend
---
Not gonna lie man 2 ganks on your way to BRD is an appetizer serving. Herod - Alliance it's genuinely 5 steps per death, at least 10 deaths to make it in. Done it several times and seen raids been delayed for it
---
I am honestly of camp that TBC was a great experience. 
---
Flying mounts are controversial, sure. 
---
But it refined so many aspects the game. Arena came out. Heroics were great. Specs became more viable and useful. I really enjoyed the raids. It was an awesome time. 
---
Also controversial but I really liked the idea of the sanctuary’s like Shattrath. 
---
Also great BG’s. 
---
It was an awesome time and I would actually prefer if we were playing TBC instead of classic right now.
---
Based on the gear they're wearing, some are definitely level 60.
---
I think what we need on every server is a tauren only guild implying they are big
---
PM me. I will share a private addon with you.
---
In retail, for those who don’t know, all realms are default pve. You can toggle pvp on and off but have to do it in a city. That’s why you don’t see the PvP servers anymore.
---
Runecloth? I think you can also farm the timbermaw rep for the white tiger mount
---
The important questions.
---
A full damage resist is the caster equivalent of a miss.
---
Which server is that? I recognize the guild name.
---
You got wrecked noob
---
Idk man I’ve been in Ferales , the hinterlands and the blasted lands and having a tough time
---
In all. I wasn’t aware of the ratio all I knew is I can’t play right now and taking a break lol
---
Not necessarily. They could have tested for this exact thing and it not happen internally. So many times we'd get player reports of an issue, have the EXACT steps and not be able to reproduce it. Even in the department you can't mimic a player's environment, unfortunately sometimes there are things you just can't reproduce. Now I'm not giving them a blanket excuse for all issues, but I like to think Blizzard at least has a competent department.
---
ok boy. you read a term on wiki. chill.
---
You tried to edit your original and you still fucked it up.  Interpretatios lolololol
---
I've seen people struggle with enhance and finally give in and swap to ele or resto endgame.
---
The problem is your ele damage starts scaling way better than your enhancement does. Stormstrike seems cool, but it costs more mana than a shock and typically deals less damage. You start to realize a lot of your damage, outside very lucky WF, is just your ele spec that's ungeared/unspecialized for doing all the work.
---
Respects are cheap if you're just trying builds, just keep int stacked gear + a shield around and try it out. You can always go back. It's only post 50 where gear starts being hard to acquire since you start hunting minmax things.
---
Because there’s ways to work around problems instead of giving up: it’s called tenacity which has served me well my entire life whether it was finishing difficult classes in school, learning musical instruments, getting better at a sport, etc. Its OK to be frustrated, but it’s not OK to be mentally weak.
---
“Lvl 60’s”
---
Wowhead only has select spells for each NPC. You’ll either need to review a combat log (best option) or review the code in DBM.
---
I mean, in the first five seconds it shows you the combo overview is at 4:15 in the video...
---
lmao got em
---
Huh I can see Ferales and the hinterlands. One of the few zones I never had trouble in. I’m just hoping that the bgs make our lives easier because I don’t enjoy watching lvl 60s kill lowbies or being killed by them.
---
Worse than that. They can flask up, full consume, world buffs, and still lose to a dual wield fury tank lmao
---
I did the run from Morgan's Vigil to UBRS a few hours ago. I didn't count, but I think it was around 7-8 times. And I managed to zone in to UBRS just a second before they would've killed me again.

---
This is a very good route, you respec at level 40 to so you can grab Mortal Strike
---
Herod is 60:40 too lmao
---
And the horde here fucking blow
---
I prefer hooking myself to the bottom of the boat and being safely dragged to the next port.  Might only work for stealth classes if Horde are feeling spicy enough to jump off the boat just to kill you.
---
Bunch of lvl 47 twinks running around ruining everyone's game. seems legit.
---
You can't use a min max rationale with class composition for pick up lobbies.  With random assortment of people in your battlegroup and all of the possible people who could join your lobby a ret paladin that throws out off heals and the occasional freedom with a ranged stun is a pretty good outcome. I feel like healer hybrids are great for non organized pvp
---
Does anyone know of an addon like TrinketMenu for consumables?
---
I like pvp, that’s why I rerolled from a PVE server throwing away 2 months of progress albeit limited because I can only play a few hours a week.  Really glad I rerolled.
---
Thanks where did you find this?
---
Oh my sweet summer child. Trust me, if the horde could slay you and feast on your women and children, they would. The reason they are holding back is because of dishonorable kills. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
I'm pretty surprised that nobody has mentioned it yet - so I will.  In classic the honor system was just implemented, and battlegrounds wont be live until December 10 - which means that if you choose a minority faction on a PvP server you will be ganked and flattened constantly to the point where leveling in contested zones (pretty much everywhere past level 20) will be nigh impossible.  After BG's are released, it'll be better, but probably not by too much.  The minority faction on most PvP servers is Alliance.  If you want to play alliance on a PvP server I would strongly caution you to choose your server wisely.  Some servers have such severe faction imbalances that it'll basically be impossible to play the game as intended if you choose wrong.

If you play on a PvE server, life is fine and you can choose to engage in PvP or abstain.   I highly recommend PvE servers, especially since you can still opt in for PvP and play battlegrounds as much as you want.
---
Buying items on the AH when their price is low, and selling when they are higher comes to mind. Other than that, not much
---
It’s the way to go for sure. The whole reasoning for classic being released was for us to be able to play WoW but not having to play retail the way it is. How much more fun would classic be if we had brand new content added rather then being drip fed the same content that we’ve all played. 
---
Btw I am still actively playing classic, only hit 60 a few days ago but just looking ahead.
---
It could be them a half hour later, or whenever the cd's are done (don't recall).
---
jesus man how the fuck can u get so worked up over a game. you really should look for something else to play if that is what u experience
---
FUCK
---
I play on PVE and theres a group of the same alliance that attack around the elevator in UC every night.     
---
They dont push into the town just to gather enough Horde so they arent outnumbered and we just fight in the elevator and outside in the coutryard or halls, usually even numbers and a nice little back and forth.    
---
At the end when you have to go or log off, we will /salute eachother and wave goodbye when we unflag. I actually look forward to fighting against them because of that and I think its alot of fun!
---
Keep it, it's the best one handed weapon for farming in a holy/reckoning build at level 60.
---
It's a combo you need to perform a single time in order to get the kill.
---
now that's something i'd gank ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
you like my 2H sword sweetie?
---
Is there any benefit to playing on a pvp server over a pve server?
---
This response haha
---
I think that 2H axe isn’t BiS
---
Isn’t there a green quest mace that better? Glacial stone or something.
---
Bears actually do not hibernate. But instead go into a deep sleep known as torpor. 
---
Bad bot.
---
The 3 piece volcanic set is good FR gear for any druid tank/OT.  Volcanic Breastplate, Volcanic Shoulders, and Volcanic leggings.  Having all 3 patterns lets the tanks mix and match what stats they need from these slots while still getting that 200+ FR.
---
You need to give more information.  Are you talking about for raiding?  Or doing dungeons as a fresh 60?  Or leveling?  For example, spirit is going to be worthless while raiding (unless you swap to  [https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19909](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19909)  for an evocation) but better while leveling.
---
If there is only one actual damaging hit, then it's a one shot. Those buffs would make your scenario a literal one shot combo.
---
Ah crap, you're right.  Guess I should just deathball all single players to fit in with you hordies.
---
&gt;  I think the idea of having seperate classic and tbc classic servers  would be the best option, but I doubt Blizzard will go that route. 
---
Of course they will go that route. It's the only way not to piss people off.
---
The way you’re using fluid term suggests that any term is fluid, all it takes is someone using it to describe a situation. Even if it’s not appropriate, and goes against the nature of term “one shot”
---
I wish I'd picked a pve server. My girlfriend is new to wow, but I am a seasoned vet, I can hold my own in pvp but she just gets griefed over and over on her warrior to the point she has absolutely no desire to play if I'm not there to help anti gank. World pvp is toxic as fuck right now, and it's not at all the way it was in vanilla.
---
Hey Deathwatch, can I talk to you about getting a link to WoWClassicRaids' [Zandalar Tribe server guild recruitment](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds?server=Zandalar+Tribe) page?  Unfortunately we only have 5 guilds for this server but we'd like to grow it!  WoWClassicRaids helps connect players with guilds, specifically for WoW Classic.  We currently have around 350 guilds across all servers and are starting to do some community outreach to improve that.  
---
Also, if you (or anyone else) has any feedback on our site we'd appreciate it very much!
---
how the hell do you have the patience for that?
---
If it makes you feel any better I got absolutely destroyed like 20 times in a row trying to get to DME to mine thorium last night lol
---
I think i got upwards of 100 gold from quest rewards / vendor weps and it’s a fun chain to do with friends atleast so worth imo.
---
It kind of depends what you are talking about.  Certain classes can solo farm some bosses.
---
I didn't even know paladins could wield axes.
---
There are plenty of people in the retail subreddit, but they're all posting and upvoting pictures of any female "cosplaying" as any character in the wow universe.
---
Repeating this from an earlier post: I grind in areas with mobs lower than I should that still give experience and away from any road/open area. This means my hp doesn’t get so low that they can gank me at 25%. Caves are good if you can see the entrance. Stay towards the back, face the entrance, sound on. Respawns are fast and if horde come in I hearth out and find a new spot. Farales (sp) is safer than Tanaris because the pvp killing squads mainly roam around the bridge/DM. I find a high spot with good visibility or a deeply forested area. If horde are below killing ogres, stay above. 
---
Be patient. Be aware. Today I killed the water elementals and giants. When horde came in, I popped a swim speed potion and skadoodled until it was quiet again. I hide in the insect hives, kill underwater with breathing pots, move, move, move. I only quest popular quest mobs very early in the morning when campers are still sleeping. It’s become part of the challenge, avoid them like the plague until I’m big enough to fight them. Use world chat. Ask where the fighting is before you zone in, go the opposite way. I’ve gotten five levels this week. I have 1 hk.
---
It doesn't matter how good you are at pvp when you're 58 and outnumbered 10 to 1 by a bunch of clowns in T1+
---
Spec demonology warlock and tank dungeons like a chad
---
My server is 70% horde :')
---
But I agree, fighting s1 at my level is pretty fun!
---
Thanks so much!
---
its not complain, its a joke ;)
---
very little.  When looking at pre-bis gear it's best to ignore those stats entirely and focus on spellpower, hit, and crit.  
---
1 crit = around 7 or 8 sp.  
---
1 hit = about 12 or 13 sp.
---
And Feralas!
---
My brother and I have landed a few kills on some high levels. He was 38 and I was low 40s when we caught a rogue out of stealth with blood fang mask. My bro opened up with his combo then realized the mask and started running mid fight. I noticed my spells landed and told him to keep fighting. A psychic scream and kidney shot later and we surprisingly dropped him unharmed. 
---
I don’t remember it like this in vanilla but I don’t have a problem with it lol
---
I know hence the ;/ - I only go to SG for MC now :)
---
You’re just trying to be a nice guy, and this toxic mf totally shits all over it. Screw him, bro.
---
its just a joke, im not crying or complaining ;)
---
We lack the spellpower gear that also brings the other stats we need atm to really play to that strength. Also if you're stacking spellpower in order to use that side you might as well be using mcp with SoR.
---
Afaik the proc on sulfuras doesn't scale with spellpower, and with that slow of a weapon you wouldn't proc it often enough to make it worth it.
---
The word “one” isn’t fluid. One = 1.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Self aggrandizing.
---
Do you enjoy doing stuff like jump runs? With a miner, a herbalist and an enchanter it's pretty great money -  having a regular crew to hang out with on discord while you're farming helps a lot, obviously!
---
I think he means following someone so you can go AFK and they’ll take you to your destination
---
It’s the same in my server. I go somewhere and get a couple kills and within 5-10 minutes 10-20 horde show up and steamroll the place. Just for me, 1 level 60.
---
You do realize not everyone that's playing are neckbeards reading blue posts every day right? I had a date and spent a little time on the sub to get hyped. I didn't realize it would be like this, and I'm sure there are tens of thousands more people in the same boat.
---
So it only took 24 hours, but I went questing in Blasted Lands yesterday and definitely noticed the faction difference. At 11pm I remember /who showing 5 other alliance all below level 60 in BL while there were easily 3x as many horde roaming about. Got camped by a 58 UD Spriest by the spirit healer for a minute and did start to get pretty salty, but he was also camping a 60 gnome mage so I could share the grief. Also different orc rogues kept jumping me right after I finish a killing mob. Lots of 1v1s around my level last night, most of which I actually won, would still die though cus his rogue/mage buddy would come from around the corner to finish me off. 
---
Was still able to find some quiet spots to quest semi-efficiently, but yeah I can definitely relate to more of the ‘BGs can’t come sooner’ posts i’ve been seeing around.
---
All in all though, still wouldn’t roll on a PvE server in 1000 years. And when I’m 60 and geared I’m going to spend my Friday nights drunk camping zeppelins til the sun rises.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
---
I have a Ryzen 5 2500U /w Vega 8 and sit comfortable at graphics quality 6 @ 40fps, this stutters down to around 20fps in intensive areas.
---
I'm looking to upgrade so I can play on max settings and get a decent FPS plus run a few other games.
---
&gt;Keep it Classic
---
I think people will have many different views on what should count as Classic. How long before there are too many changes? I can see controversy happening already.
---
Don’t let that asshole give you a bad impression of my beloved Kromcrush
---
dark runes.  Farm them out of scholo or buy them on the AH.
---
What level are you? If you’re looking for a social guild and yours is not, consider g quitting and asking specifically to join a social guild with disc.
---
Warriors are the worst. I swear, they just charge without even glancing at the rest of the group's bars, location, or even their own health bar. All they look at is the goddamn rage bar.
---
Healer ended last pull with 4% and is sitting drinking? Rest of group oom and no one is topped off? Warrior only has 40% health? Warrior leaves the room breaking LoS on healer, charges into pack and dies. Then the warrior says the healer sucks. 
---
Or, warrior decides to dual wield tank in strat. Pulls all the fatties without leaving combat once, rest of group pops consumables to stay afloat. Group wipes on all the normal mobs that come rushing out? Everyone's fault but the warrior. Warrior doesn't put on shield, dies when the elite skellies come out of the slaughter house? Everyone else's fault. 
---
Warriors are the worst
---
At this point I only run with warrior tanks as a last resort in dungeons. I'll take a paladin or druid tank over a warrior any day of the week in a five man, because they usually try harder than a warrior tank. I've had exactly one bad druid/paladin tank, and I run with druid/paladins way more than I run with warriors. But 9/10 warrior tanks I run with suck. The only ones I've found that compete with druid/paladin tanks in five man's are my guilds raid tanks....
---
I'm really excited for arenas
---
MoP was a great expansion, at least from a PvP perspective. Much better than Cata and WoD. I would not mind playing MoP again actually.
---
Level 16 lol
---
Why do people prefer default frames? I don't understand why having your character name take up twice more space than your healthbar is good design.
---
Oh Come on dude everything was pointing to that - everyone knows horde weigh more heavily on pvp, the google docs also told us that. 
---
My server is higher horde pop and im still continually ganked. It takes me 7 deaths to get into BRD. Its pvp, i knew this when I picked a pvp server lol.
---
Is there a way to hide “not enough rage” and those errors in my UI through a command or add on?
---
Theres a moonwell in stormwind.... All those wasted teleport runes...
---
A group of warlocks who will summon you to major cities/ points of Interest like the hydraxian overlords for gold
---
I did a lot of prot tanking on pservers and while i do think its good for the level it loses out to other weps later on. If you're going a reckoning build which i really recommend then you want a slower wep. Imp SoR only improves base dmg, slower wep=higher base dmg, more bang for your buck with reckoning. 
---
Its up to you what you want to do, but i value epic mount and engi shield higher than flurry axe, ultimately saving up for engi shield will be bettee for your threat tyan flurry axe.
---
5% of people in the 19 bracket will be non twinks.. I actually feel quite bad for this warrior
---
You are a smart man. You consider an items worth before making the same mistake I made just hours ago. Sold the recipe for transmute essence of undeath to water for 150 gold. Have since then learned that its easily 800 gold and maybe even up to 2000 gold.. I am an IDIOT
---
Windows are merely suggestions
---
There is a 1% chance for spells to be resisted, regardless of literally anything. It's quite a pain for mages when doing something like ZF farm, as you can end up with like 30+ zombies on you. The odds of one of them resisting a nova/cone of cold gets pretty substantial.
---
On my lvl 40 pally I noticed that high level horde player ignore me a lot. Get the occasional gank of course but they mostly seem not interested me.
---
&gt;I'll answer from generalized point of view.  People are very invested in their characters and improving them.  When you become stronger there is a big feeling of satisfaction and return on investment.  People will spend a lot of time and money for small boosts like enchants.  If you can do something in the game that makes you stronger, why wouldn't you?  Min/max is never essential (clearing MC in greens) it's just something people enjoy.
---
As a rule of thumb, a warlock should reroll if he ever gets killed by a priest or even lose a 1v1
---
Surprised at how many people aren’t suggesting rogues on this thread. Another aspect of PvP isn’t just winning in a 1v1 but it’s being able to open the fight. You get some good time to decide if it’s worth it.
---
So title should be 'Level 36 Engineer 5 hits level 60s'
---
nice work i love it. btw about dr i think it's on purpose. charges stun so they share a dr with other stuns.
---
I didn't say the word "one" is fluid, I said that the term "one shot" is. If you're going to try to be pedantic, put on your reading glasses first before bothering me.
---
Wish i knew this back when I did it on my mage
---
Bgs won't give you XP
---
Literally unwatchable!!!!!!
---
Are you sure they're holding baguettes like swords, as opposed to wands? It's the same word in French. If so, they'd shoot something. Frosting? Flour?
---
I mean there are more horde, yes, but I’ve had some really good fights at hillsbrad where the alliance push us back to tarren mill. A raid group came to brm last night and destroyed all the horde there also and I couldn’t get my body back. Two nights ago we had one and a half raids outside IF and couldn’t get past the gate, we even go pushed back so hard we all ran and got body camped. While yes there are more horde, there’s plenty of alliance also, and when both sides group up to fight it’s usually very even
---
It's really not. Happens all the time on Sulfuras. Even if it isn't for the lols, people will help guildies deny enemy factions a questing area.
---
the game won't die because of PvP and if you dislike it literally just go on a PvE server Jesus Christ
---
Levelling for BGs not in BGs.
---
You and I have not had the same classic experience.
---
The amount people triggered by "one shot" it's absurdly high.
---
Yes, every serious player in pvp will. Oneshotting the enemy healer is more important than having more consistent DPS output. You want to burst as much as possible, hence HoJ being your BiS pvp trinket for basically ever.
---
If you sit at 22% crit atm you didn't farm your PvP gear. I sit at 28% and I miss 1% from a piece.
---
They think it's all fun and games until 3/4 of their HP are gone.
---
Then it's "OH SHIT"
---
Drain tanking
---
undead priest is a great choice, those levels are always so fun! i definitely think you'll like the later dungeons - there's even a continuation, of sorts, to the scarlet monastery story.... anyways! 
---
leveling definitely will slow down from here on out, but there are some things you can do to make it better. make sure you keep your wand up to date, and keep doing dungeons a bunch so you get those sweet blues. at your level the Hinterlands quest hub opens up (you can get there from hillsbrad) and and it has SO many quests, you end up getting insane amounts of exp. definitely recommend going there
---
Not to be an ass, but for people that missed the original it would've been so much better to experience it when the game was new and no one knew anything about the game mechanics and raids.
---
1.14.0 in few weeks anyway.
---
Sell your tanking services in dungeons. 
---
25g a run or something similar.  That + the money you make in dungeon probably push it to 40g per give or take (more if you do live strat). 
---
Also you could do live strat &amp; put 1 orb on Res as services for tanking. Same thing basically.
---
Sounds like you're a new player? Melee classes are tough pre 40 unless you are fed good gear.  I'd try hunter or warlock to learn the game and read some guides to help. Up to you really but playing another character is not a big deal for change of pace.
---
lol like that will help with ass hat same faction people right? How will PvE help that cancer? Jesus Christ
---
Thanks! After going from desolace to tanaris, I'm looking forward for some more interesting terrain.
---
I almost never get a queue on incidious.
---
If not - DM East jumps &amp; sell / split everything. Probably 30g an hour or more
---
That's why I like to fear them into hostile mobs
---
Onslaught is pretty well liked by the Horde, they're the most hardcore guild on our faction IMO. The only big guild with a bad reputation Horde side is Mind Games so feel free to whop them whenever you see one of their bajillion members.
---
Farm gold and buy runecloth.
---
Well I know that the simplest way to get your question answered is to use the stickied questions megathread.
---
It's basically cheat mode. If they kill him, they get a dk. So he always wins. But none the less impressive burst.
---
The tiger comes from the winterspring frostsaber rep and takes ages to farm
---
Congratulations mate! I would really like to play a ret pally, maybe sometime soon.
---
They don't want a dishonorable kill.
---
I’d say join mine but your ally! Lol my guilds very active and friendly! Always looking for more people to get 60 and we have raids
---
We got the eye on my guilds first rag kill
---
wont this still move all my gear randomly in the bag?
---
Oh I almost forgot, how is your wiener?
---
Lol why would anyone farm the entire LBRS instance for that recipe? Rogues can get about 1 recipe every 2 hours solo
---
Make sure you're combat swords and picking up Riposte/precision/blade flurry at 30 etc. And get sword upgrades as soon as you can.
---
Something like
---
Wing Blade &gt; Outlaw Sabre &gt; Sword of Omen &gt; Vanquisher's Sword &gt; Thrash Blade
---
Stealth is kinda pointless outside of Sap/getting past stuff until you get Cheap Shot, and even then it's not really great.
---
ZT, i spend 20min getting 150yards from the FP in Seering Gorge, and simply gave up and went on an alt. there were 20+ alliance camping and i had to wait 2min for each res.
---
Engineering nades tho?
---
And this is why engineering ruins the entire profession system of classic
---
Not being a gnome is gonna be painful at 19
---
Read that in Shaxx voice
---
They already are.
---
low levels don't give dishonorable kills. Only  civilians do.
---
Sounds like you've never been to stranglethorn or southshore
---
Yeah but then occasionally when your armor does match and you get a couple of badass pieces you really appreciate how cool you look
---
Im not a new player, been playing since BC. Back then, however, I was playing a warlock. I wanted to try out something different, so I went rogue: but as in the post, Ive had a lot of problems with it.
---
Thanks the point about being around 40, though. I'll keep that in mind.
---
rumor has it, some warriors are actually good at the game.
---
but i see your point i know a lot of people like this. not just warrior though.
---
On many servers, Morgan's Vigil is death upon landing. The death hopping towards BRM from there is also longer, and the graveyard further away than Thorium Point. So the consensus has become if you're fucked anyway, take the shortest route.
---
Frankly I agree. Already rerolled on another server. Will transfer my 60 once im allowed.
---
None
---
Would I use ABB if I already have the hand cannon, though?
---
I guess the question is more how valuable is the 3% hit plus 11 agility on the bow, plus the fact that I can replace other hit gear with stronger options.
---
Because they get nothing out of doing it
---
I would add a necromancer
---
Yup, went swords and went parry. Still slow, still taking lots of damage.
---
It is more exciting.  You are in danger at all times, and having played PvP servers since back in the day - it has the potential to be more fun.  However, other players can absolutely ruin your time if they want to - and they often do.  There have been oceans of tears deluging this subreddit for 2 weeks about the game now being "unplayable" as dominant factions are absolutely making life miserable for anyone who crosses their path.  Roaming packs of players looking for literally anything they can attack.  It's worse than the wild west right now.  
---
If you're not an avid PvPer who is hell bent on being able to find lots of random engagements in the open world, I'd highly suggest a PvE server.  Before you do anything though, go through the last couple weeks history of this subreddit and read it.  Then make your decision.  Classic is awesome, just be careful and deliberate about where you choose to play.
---
None. Except maybe having a conscience or a single iota of empathy.
---
I don't think a new class would improve the wow experience. I giving all specs useful powers would improve the wow experience (similar to wow tbc class balancing - atleast in pve)
---
edit: -I
---
You joke... But fuck if I haven't considered it.
---
You don’t get dishonorable kills from players.
---
Are you on a PvE or PvP server? If you're on a PvP server, epic mount takes priority over literally anything else.
---
If you're on a PvE server, I'd just save the arcanite for lionheart and the gold will come easily enough from dungeon runs over time. And keep in mind that as long as you get to rank 3, it'll be 800g instead of 900g for your mount.
---
yeah but did u try aiming with a solid square?
---
Make sure you've got first aid and make use of Gouge + bandage often. I didn't even need to eat food until like level 40 (outside of DoTs). If you pull 2 mobs, Blade Flurry. Next time you pull 2 mobs, evasion. Both together you can pull like 5-6 mobs with no issue.
---
&gt;Then what’s the incentive for 60s to not gank lowbies?
---
We don't do that here.
---
Demon hunter
---
The actual ret dps starts with BWL when they can do spelladins. But even then they are going to lose to the high scaling warriors, rogues, etc.  
---
Playing a paladin like warriors only works in MC/Onyxia, afterwards you want to get spell damage and a fast hitting weapon.
---
Do you play on a PVP server?  I ask because I do and it seems like rogues are the only people having any fun.
---
If you want to tank as a paladin, the FA is the best tanking weapon. Your ability to keep aggro depends on your holy dmg. The proc of the flurry axe (which can also activated by SoR) will make sure that you keep a steady stream of dmg and aggro. Slower weapons may hit harder and give you higher holy dmg per strike but a couple of misses/dodges/parries mean that will end up losing aggro to your party (as you will end up waiting several seconds before you can generate aggro). While you can easily manage those windows of no dmg against mobs, they are the difference between a wipe and successful boss kill. 
---
Besides the aggro issue, the proc of the FA combined with SoW is great at reducing your downtime due to mana constraints. While you will still have to stop and drink from time to time, the FA will increase the speed at which you can clear dungeon mobs and help you to keep impatient dps in check (which is the source of 90% of the problems faced by a pally tank).
---
Necromancer or runemaster
---
Well, reroll if you don't like it. Leveling is long enough with a class you enjoy
---
Priest might have ganked the rogues alt a few times? I'm not above corpse camping somebody in STV for killing my alt.
---
the highest warrior parsers are like 900. The best ret pally in the entire gmae is about as good as your pretty decent warrior/rogue in any random guild.
---
It's fluid now because people are fucking stupid.
---
The top warrior in Method's Dueling Tournament is using Hand of Rag. The damage and proc are both better than BRE.
---
One proc from Hand of Rag is over 1/4th of someone's health. Meanwhile, BRE proc might do 5% of their health.
---
I've been enjoying it but I rarely talk to people outside my guild/friends. I have had some bad pugs but no more than usual for WoW.
---
I do not sub to this sub to watch cakes.  Art destroyed the wow sub.. dont want it to happen here too
---
Should post this on the Fairbanks subreddit. But hit me up in game same name. Not really a lvling guild if that’s what your looking for. But if I’m not busy I can help you with the red ridge elite quests or whatever. What’s your class
---
Yeah fuck it whatever. Original point still stands. Videos title is "One-shot" and has fucking "insane *combo*" in the thumbnail.
---
Get the one from SM!
---
&gt;retirement pally
---
Just because I protest it doesn't mean that I think it's new around here. I protet it anytime I spot it.
---
Yes, but as Ally, so I typically just get ganked 24/7.
---
Not one shotting *and* FP camping people. You're so cool bro.
---
I think you should play Classic over Retail.  BFA is about to end so starting fresh and learning everything will be very hard since everything is very well known so people don't really have the patience to explain to newcomers.  Classic is  somehow fresh (3 months old) so you will find way more new player and people are way more understanding.  Also the game is more simple and doesn't feel overcrowded by weird objective (Guarrison, Titanforging, etc). Classic feel more like a standard MMO.
---
That being said.  WoW Classic is very very simple, straightforward and noob friendly.  Everything come very slowly at you and you have time to master each spells before getting a new one.  Classic will seem time consumming but every minutes invested and every loot acquired will feel like actual progress.  I remember linking newly acquired GREEN gear to my guildies.  I still remember the feeling of getting a Blue Piece of gear.  In retail you will jump from one item to the other and every reward  will feel empty.  In Retail the journey seems to be a burden to reach endgame and start enjoying the game.  In Classic your journey will feel rewarding and end game will be your well deserved reward.
---
In conclusion, you should try it for yourself.  WoW Classic is the perfect game for me but it might be different for you. You won't know unless you try it.  If you do decide to try it just let me know.  I play Horde on Incendius and will be able to hook you up with some starting money and bags.
---
Not just low end but "barely above the tanks" end of the DPS spectrum. Moonkins, ferals and shadow priests are vastly better performers.
---
You sound just as annoying as the tank
---
With Windfury, yes.
---
&gt; Well not really good = same as "there are better"
---
Literally no. That's absolutely stupid; this stupid "BIS only" mentality that came from Retail needs to stay there. 
---
&gt;It takes a debuffslot = very bad for raid.
---
No, it's not very bad. It won't change much.
---
to actually play this game longterm, you need to be into pvp. it's much more core to this game than a lot of people realize. PvErs at most will just become raidloggers, and raidloggers dont really make sense to me cause why not just play retail where the difficulty increases and is somewhat endless?
---
sorry a bit late, but this was a common vanilla change and charge macro. 
---
/cancelaura [stance:2] Aquatic Form; [stance:3] Cat Form; [stance:4] Travel Form; [stance:5] Moonkin Form &lt;or Tree of Life&gt;

Remember to edit it so it fits you.
---
Unfortunately I started in a very small guild with just a few friends that have drifted away, so spent a large amount of time leveling in PUGs,  some were good, but sooo many were bad.
---
Are you a cunt?
---
i swapped to shadowed unit frames
---
No, I did Server first Level70 on Dalvengyr but then moved to Dethecus to finish TBC and Azshara in WotLk.
---
Nice, you managed to be condescending and wrong in the same post.
---
I leveled 59-60 yesterday entirely in scholomance. 7 runs and 4 turn ins did the trick. Took 11 hours. I'm not proud of this and am so burnt out on scholomance but God damn it I'm 60 now so at least this is out of the way. I'd recommend doing the same thing. The area outside is rarely camped because they are too busy farming chillwind.
---
There's no point continuing talking to you; you already changed your argument entirely and are pretending it's the same. Blocking this kind of silly talk.
---
how did i not know this..
---
ty!
---
Same on my server (westfall-horde). Every day the same group of alliance sit outside of Orgrimmar and a lot of the same horde go out and meet them for a while. Eventually horde outnumbers them and they port back home, but there's good honor for all in the meantime.
---
It's 65/35 horde favored and the top earners on the horde that I've seen (including one of the spriests exploiting) average about 20-25k/day. I see most of the top 30 guys once or more a day.
---
Ha-ha, you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!
---
Reroll to a Warlock. 29 is not that high so it's not a big waste. I don't think you'll like rogues in BGs at 60.
---
Some abilities (like howl) you can learn just standing around and spamming it on CD. Some you need to be killing something to get, like bite. Be sure they are on the pet bar and active, and there are reports that happiness level and proximity to the pet help, but those may be myths.
---
I am pretty sure you don't need all ranks to learn something. That would be evil.
---
"one-shot"
---
Also looking at this UI and how he moves im not sure if this video  is from 2005 or 2019.
---
Ah that sucks. We decided to avoid the "small friend guild" route since we were probably gonna run into that issue. We split up and joined a few different bigger guilds and found the right one for us. Horde side I was a big fan of Primordial but eventually ended up in Dynasty.
---
Guess you are right. It just hurts to sell them because it was a heavy time investment to farm those haha
---
I liked TBC more than classic, just my 2 cents.
---
I’m hoping it goes that way, but I wouldn’t mind even if it didn’t, because I didn’t like daily quests (as an adult) and I think the whole heroic 5 mans handing out epics made them too easy to come by.. no enjoyment when they’re that easy to get.
---
That's how language works, but for some reason people think that language should never evolve past that one specific place in time when they used the word
---
"pvp"
---
I'm saying they said you wouldnt like it, and it seems a lot of you don't
---
it's sunday, grandpa.  did you forget to take your meds?
---
one shot as in one try. In this context one-shot should mean one attack.
---
wtf does that mean
---
It should be an option in the interface menu called Error Speech iirc.
---
A bread in a ranged slot? My mage needs this!
---
50 arcanite bars are nothing. That's farmed extremely fast if you need them. BRE aren't raining either.
---
Basically you're acting like the two weapons are rewards from a quest which you can freely choose from; in which case your stance would make sense. If I can freely click on one which does a tiny bit more damage and doesn't cost 50 arcanite bars, then sure. 
---
But that's not the case here at all; you could never see BRE. It happens to tons of guilds, just like tons of guild never see the eye of sulfuras. Common sense is more like: work with whatever drops, and one guy with Sulfuras+one guy with BRE will deal more damage that one guy with BRE and one with fucking Demonshear.
---
In PvP, the opponent is dead long before you get up 3 stacks.
---
Sulfuras is better because one proc will take out over 1/4th of the opponents HP without any extra attacks. BRE requires hitting the opponent after the proc to be useful.
---
So if start referring to plates of spaghetti as hamburgers, is that language evolving? Where's the change off between evolution and incorrect usage?
---
It's all about your priorities.  You've got enough gold to buy the rest of the arcanite and get your lion hat made.  Would you benefit more from the upgrade of your helm, or improving your movement speed by 40%?  I personally think having an epic mount is the #1 upgrade you can make, and everything else comes after that.  If you've got 550g, and you're rank 3, you really just need 250g for your mount, really.  That's 4 or 5 arcanite bars.  You won't have to start all over on lionheart.
---
Imagine playing a game for reasons other than fun and thinking it makes you cool.
---
Keep it up, make sure your mental health &gt; honor farmed
---
Edgemasters, freezing band, cloudkeepers
---
It is a better PvP weapon. People die too fast in PvP for BRE proc to matter.
---
Inconceivable!
---
30-40 is hell on earth.
---
When you get to tanaris there are so many quests you are drowned in them. Downhill from 40!
---
Horde yes (windfury). Orc especially.
---
Edit: for orc it’s basically pre-BiS next to the beautiful but expensive arc reaper. Our warrior with it does 500-600 dps without world buffs but could easily go higher (threat capped).
---
For alliance it’s probably not worth it at all. Just get 2 swords.
---
So there's a dude killing players 24 lvls higher than him? Yep, that's the final point that proves, that all those whiney steamers are trash.
---
First time playing wow since I was in 2nd grade and had no idea what was going on. Personally I love the game way more than I thought I would. Just finally got into a guild that will take me to raids and tried mc and ony in the past week. They are pretty stressful as a healer but a lot of fun. I really am completely uninterested in open world pvp though, and it has really ruined my ability to play out in the world. I like to play by myself and just farm and that was possible in phase 1, but now I feel like I’m just bait for 10 man squads to roll up on me for free honor. Also getting killed at flight paths after they wait out the honorless debuff is super lame.Now all I do is solo farm dire maul or maurodon which isn’t so fun. With the next update I hope BGs take over as the honor farm of choice so I can do stuff solo in the world again. Still having fun though and looking forward to doing more mc and ony and trying the new raids when they come out.
---
If you have healer friend you can run strat living and reserve orbs, just find 3 random dps who want pre raid BiS from there. Split the gold with the healer. Or if you want to risk it look for a healer and 3 dps, all gold for you. I see people doing this, some ppl reserve greens as well.
---
Rippp feels bad man
---
Because some people just like the original look more?
---
I never thought of it this way, but that's a damn good point, lol.
---
When talking about one shot in PVP, that term is definitely not fluid. It’s a strict definition of one-shot to kill.
---
Enjoy your 2-3 hours a week of being brought along as a buff bot and not being able to do any dungeons unless you have friends.
---
Well that’s true for a person who levels at a consistent rate but when you’re playing for the first time you waste a lot of time 1-40 figuring out how to play the game. Travel efficiently, quest efficiently, you end up running around a lot. Once you know how to play, you gain xp more efficiently if you just quest and have a good guild. On the flip side you waste a lot of played time waiting for groups for dungeons or to travel to dungeons.
---
Ayeeeee when I hop on tonight ill add you
---
I mean honestly from 56 you should just do dungeons and get the pre bis.
---
Sure you will get to 60 slower but what is the rush? You still need to spam the same dungeons at 60. Might as well save the time and get good gear when you hit 60 and start raiding from the get go.
---
You have a very weird definition of "useless" if you think that 25% stun resist makes a matchup "useless".
---
I hate that leather in general is so good for classes other than rogue. Devilsaur looks great on rogues imo. But seeing shit like pallies and warriors wearing all leather they just look so stupid lol. Kind of a class fantasy type thing for me I guess.
---
Makes me think of the artwork from Gauntlet Dark Legacy. Such a fantastic game, and this artwork is great.
---
If it generates money for them, why not?
---
You are right. The BRE proc hardly even matters because of how fast people die. Its much better to get that up front damage.
---
I will deinstall the game if this ever happens to me..
---
That you... actually I’m already using it but never thought that way. Simple solution :)
---
He doesn't own the player he is trying to kill. Do whatever you want, and if you get a share of the honor who gives a fuck.
---
Wowhead stats can be tremendously innacurrate
---
you can farm ZF GY from level 44 or something, shouldnt be a problem at 60
---
Ret pala wannabe reporting in. Can't confirm, i heal every raid, noone wants a ret.
---
They wouldn't understand. They are far too jaded now to enjoy a simple joke.
---
Its definitely the better PvP weapon. Higher top end damage and BRE proc hardly matters with how fast people die. Much better to get that up front fireblast.
---
lol no
---
TL;DW: Undead skull farming a player, then corpse camps for five minutes, twice.
---
Guessing you come from Kromkrush
---
His frames are slightly uneven though :(
---
Happened to me 2x.
---
Looks like someone kept a Window open.
---
Once you get epics, things start looking better.
---
Blues and greens are definitely all over the place.
---
Please show me on the doll where the level 36 touched you.
---
Committing toxic behavior is admirable?
---
I'd love to know what kind of guilds are seeing numbers like that in current classic. Looking at our last MC, in which we cleared everything in about 75 minutes, very few players ever hit 400. A couple of Warriors on Magmadar and Golemagg, and the Mages on Shazzrah and Ragnaros.
---
Most frames I've seen look too 'clean' and gradient. I prefer a frame that suits the theme of wow. Haven't bothered to look for different ones,only seen the 'most popular' ones.
---
Wow, feel more sorry for yourself
---
its just as bad on the other side
---
running from redridge is prob the safest as you dont die as soon as you land off the FP
---
To anyone trying to get 60.
---
one word.
---
SCHOLOMANCE.
---
Dire maul. Fuck no impossible
---
BRD, impossible.
---
Stratholme, almost impossible.
---
Scholomance. Just a few corpse runs if even that.
---
Correct. For alliance def want Glacial Stone.  For horde, I think Night Reaver is sllliiiightly worse than Runic Darkblade.  However, Deadskull Shield is BiS shield and shields are more important
---
I think you will get locked to the ID if the boss is even aggrod, not killed
---
The thing is I want to swing big swords and carry plate :/ I guess I am doomed :P
---
Yup, it's why private servers has historically been so toxic. It's not AS bad in Classic due to a portion of the community being there for nostalgic reasons.
---
&gt;Warriors are the worst. I swear, they just charge without even glancing at the rest of the group's bars, location, or even their own health bar. All they look at is the goddamn rage bar.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Healer ended last pull with 4% and is sitting drinking? Rest of group oom and no one is topped off? Warrior only has 40% health? Warrior leaves the room breaking LoS on healer, charges into pack and dies. Then the warrior says the healer sucks.  
---
&gt;Or, warrior decides to dual wield tank in strat. Pulls all the fatties without leaving combat once, rest of group pops consumables to stay afloat. Group wipes on all the normal mobs that come rushing out? Everyone's fault but the warrior. Warrior doesn't put on shield, dies when the elite skellies come out of the slaughter house? Everyone else's fault.  
---
&gt;Warriors are the worst  
---
&gt;At this point I only run with warrior tanks as a last resort in dungeons. I'll take a paladin or druid tank over a warrior any day of the week in a five man, because they usually try harder than a warrior tank. I've had exactly one bad druid/paladin tank, and I run with druid/paladins way more than I run with warriors. But 9/10 warrior tanks I run with suck. The only ones I've found that compete with druid/paladin tanks in five man's are my guilds raid tanks....
---
Pretty much yeah. There is a post on the front page right now that is like "aren't you glad you're living in a time where WoW classic exists?" and all I can think is yeah, but I wished I was a teenager playing WoW Vanilla in 2005 instead. It kind of worries me because Halo is releasing on PC in a weekish and I am SO excited to go back and play Reach (until 3 drops, then I will only play 3) but I already know the community will be entirely different and it just wont be the same.
---
That's been happening to me since classic released. Once dropped me on an unreachable mountain and had to take rez sickness
---
&gt;Real question: why do you think people do that?
---
Because it is by a large margin the most efficient way to farm honor in the game currently.
---
I hate the idea of giving up my enhancement spec to heal dungeons because I'd love to swing that hand of rag.
---
With that being said, how often do you switch specs between the two if wanted to run both?
---
Translation :"I'm an angry beta, please upvote my attempt to make others miserable."
---
It's insane how players today have more information than vanilla players could have ever dreamed or hoped for.. and they're still spreading the same misinformation 15 years later. It's like willful ignorance
---
Gnomes are a little short tempered...
---
I'm 52, I almost made it, but just didn't have enough time to spend getting to 60.
---
It's fucking unplayable for me and I unsubbed. This game at the moment is a fucking joke on certain servers.
---
I was in my servers top guild in TBC.  At the end of the expansion, when we were focusing on sunwell plateau progression, we would usually clear black temple (the raid tier just below sunwell) on Monday night just before the raid reset.  We cleared BT just for the legendary warglaives off Illidan - for our rogues.  
---
One Monday night, our GM decided we would push the last encounter we were running progression on (In sunwell) instead of doing BT because we had gotten extremely close to killing the night before.  We downed the new boss and still had about an hour of raid time left.  Our main competing guild on our server was an Aussie guild who had already given that weeks raids their final effort, and they cleared BT all the way up to Illidan, but hadn't killed him.  Their raid disbanded and they had long retired for the day.
---
I don't know how- but somebody from my guild managed to get saved to our competing guilds raid ID, and we rolled up in there and killed their Illidan at the end of our raid.  Our rival guild was absolutely furious when they found out.  The glaives did not drop, and I suspect that if one did there would have been hell to pay.  We never would have done it if they had a chance at downing him, but they had never downed him yet and they were done raiding for the week.
---
So yeah....raid ID's.
---
Go back in time and not give the server capacity 3x-5x what the original vanilla server cap was. Now there's WAY too many people in the world.
---
I usually whisper instructions as the dungeon progresses.
---
Probably bullied irl and releases his rage in wow.. pretty common for douchebaggery
---
Any term is fluid though. This was a one shot combo. That term was shorted to one shot.
---
do all the darnassus quest while at an appropriate level, keep spamming morrowgrain and buy a lot of runecloth
---
So I have to lvl engineer from 1-300 and then pick gnome. Then drop engineering completely. Lvl engineering again 1-300 and pick goblin the second time. Does that sound right?
---
It isn't that they are ignoring the fact that you are new, it's that they don't want to lead the group which is why they dont play a tank.
---
Drain tanking is whithout a doubt the best leveling build
---
Lol. Um, no, it’s not. Leveling my first char right now and it’s a nightmare.
---
Dark/demonic rune, greater mana pot, and evocation should carry you through the fight. Make sure you use your GFPP well before the pull your potions are off timer. It lasts for 1 hour so there is no time crunch. If your group isnt able to kill before submerge, it is absolutely vital you have a good chunk of mana for the submerge phase. The elementals need to be grouped up and AOEd down and thats your time to really do the mage thang.
---
please stop with the "pvp is so broken and unfair" spam.  You just couldn't let one post happen without it, or what?
---
While I agree with the idea of “one hit”, it’s difficult to argue that the term itself has been evolving away from that for years now. 
---
In terms of WoW, at least for 3 expansions now, videos have been marketing combos + specific builds as “one shots”. Especially combos that are applied so quickly that the victim is functionally incapable of responding. In fact, it seems like the idea of the victim being unable to react is a big part of the idea.
---
Is this ABSOLUTELY click bait? Yes, it is. At least initially. But at this point I’ve seen it outside of the YouTube sphere as well, just in guild chat and whatnot. 
---
It’s just terminology in transition, really. And while I agree none of these are strictly a one-shot, is VERY difficult to close a Pandora’s Box once one of these types of evolutions takes place. Annoying and “technically” wrong as it may be, I doubt it’s going anywhere.
---
That's what I appreciates about peoples like you.
---
If you can't keep the heal jitters away when someone's life bar is at 80%, that is not on the warlock. I'm not going to drink from one cast if the first thing I do in combat is DRAIN Life.
---
You seem basically, feel free to not heal my life tap damage, I have other ways to heal. However if you take it as warlocks should not life tap in dungeons or you won't heal them because they no longer fit into your one button rotation, then sorry bro you're just a bad healer.
---
Tl;dr stop healing the warlock if he's above 40. I refuse to cripple my class just so you don't have to think when you play yours.
---
Edit:
---
Basically this; regularly in an instance I will life tap and start to cannibalize. I'll get a renew dropped on me 100% of the time, and a complaint probably 10-20%
---
Prolem was already addressed, healer just saw hp not 100% and started blasting. This is a regular occurance.
---
Im not asking to have my life tap healed away, I get that it means 2 drink runs. I'm asking to be able to life tap without every healer in the region having an aneurism I can't tell if people don't understand how warlocks work or just don't give a shit.
---
But they both play on a pvp server. Your post makes no sense. Stop it.
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
---
Soups been called lookit
---
There is an economic limiting factor, but every day that passes diminishes its effect. 
---
I figure it like this: If you take engineering youre not making much gold to start. Its a big investment. If that causes a player to go without an epic mount, better enchants, or pots it can help even the playing field. But once they catch up on gold, none of that really matters anymore.
---
This is the current culture of pvp in WoW - "hardcore" and "skilled" pvpers all roll Horde so they will have a numbers advantage to show off their skills. It will never change.
---
New to wow and just leveled a lock to 60. I wanted to start a Warrior alt to learn how to tank.
---
I don't mind XP efficiency or anything and I'm planning to quest to 30 and just Dungeon grind from 30-60.
---
I always see that people should stick to arms/fury spec while leveling even in dungeons. But since my warr alt will literally live in dungeons, would I benefit from speccing in to Prot to 60? Or should I still do Arms/Fury spec til 60.
---
r/osteoporosis
---
With the right composition, I'd guess you could do at least most of it.  I think it would be painful and slow though.  If you had 2 fury warriors and a very geared resto shaman, I can imagine that working very well.
---
Our PvP warriors are poor from respeccing twice a week. They'd have to stop PvPing for months to farm up 5000g for Hand of Rag.
---
Meanwhile, you have to be a special kind of crazy to play a Ret Paladin in Classic, and farming 5000g fits right in with that.
---
And you still need to get exalted with Darnassus in order to learn tiger riding.
---
They were from an outside perspective
---
Great point about people being less forgiving. Now if someone fucks up it's in your best interest to make it work because itll take another 20+minutes to replace/wait for a new player to show up
---
Morrowgrain is pretty bad if you're not a herbalist, you're probably better off just spending your time farming gold for runecloth.
---
There's no context at all. I would do the same if this priest ganked my alt over and over.
---
First time I've seen somebody else post from Stonespine
---
Can't get Onyxia attunement because of the BS flight path camping, it's been the same 10 players sitting there since release
---
Get a life!
---
&gt; If you expected a 36 warrior to deal 3600+ damage in one hit because the title said “one shot”, then I guess I’d understand your disappointment. Lol.
---
Yeah, I did and I'm not sure why you think that's absurd given the title. The title says that the warrior one-shots his opponents. The meaning of the phrase one-shot as I understand it is going from 100 to 0 in one blow. That's not a controversial definition of the term, at least not in my experience.
---
&gt; While I think “one shot” is a fair title for this video, maybe “one shot combo” would be most clear.
---
"One shot combo" is a contradictory term though - he either one shotted them or he comboed them, but he didn't do both. If you're using that to say he did it in a single combo, then just say "combo." These are not very good examples of language evolving. They are good examples of unnecessary language causing confusion, though.
---
Yes you want to use an axe. The hit rating you get from the weapon skill is massive, and as a tank who needs to be in plate its hard to find hit gear lying around. Speed is not as crucial if you have the reliability of landing your hits.
---
You only get saved to raid if you're in it while a boss is killed - or if you zone into a raid with some already dead bosses.
---

Oh man, you would hate my UI.  I eyeball everything, and don't care if it's slightly off.
---
Just hit 59 with my rogue and I love it way more now than I did early on. I feel like the ganking and loaded 60s with nothing better to do has gotten way worse since I was 29 though so I wouldnt blame you for rerolling. It does get more fun, as long as getting there doesnt do you head in
---
o k b o o m e r
---
I love helping new players get the hang of things. I gladly take the lead and mark stuff + give advice if I heal and thr tank just doesn't know where and how to go. So much more rewarding than being a toxic cunt.
---
Sulfuras is better in PvP. It has better damage and a better proc. people die too fast for BRE proc to matter.
---
To be clear this only works if you're gnomish and you're getting help from goblin. The goblin stuff is all boe but gnomish is BoP.
---
This is why all the high levels are ganking me...
---
For PvP, hand of rag is better than BRE.
---
Even for PvE, hand of rag is better as long as other people are keeping up the BRE proc.
---
Then what swords are you using? What is your rotation? Have you bothered to get blues from Dmines?
---
BRM is basically Alterac Valley at the moment, for better and for worse. If you're running with a group, you can have some fun skirmishes. If you're running by yourself, you're dogfood.
---
Wait!
---
Av mount is 650 gold after you do av for a few hours on your baby mount.
---
Or,
---
Get pvp rank 3 and honoured, its 20% discount!
---
Otherways:
---
Run UBRS - reserve Truestrike and Dal rends for 150 gold each. I know its dirty, but I have seen it, and I would pay 150 in a heartbeat.
---
you misunderstand the term one shotting, because that took several
---
Your talents are arms to crit bonus, then the usual fury talents with imp cleave and not offhand bonus damage (no imp slam).
---
Rotation is BT WW hamstring x4 BT then hamstring even global that can’t be a BT or WW and won’t delay either (you often wait a few globals so as to keep the 30 rage for BT.
---
Idea is hamstring procs WF, HoJ and flurry. You should try use it when you know WF is procable (I will sometimes use it when my auto attack has only got me to 20ish rage just to try proc a WF to generate more rage.
---
You dump excess rage with cleave (when you have 55+) so you don’t generate the extra threat from HS. The +8 wep skill makes this thing awesome for any horde warrior to raid with. 
---
Have fun!
---
~8-12 for non-stealth character.
---
just don't post anything praising Paladins, every time I do I get downvoted
---
Our guild has 2 raids. One is hardcore progress and one is casual. We only let top performers into the hardcore and more casual into the second which includes off specs. You just need to find one of these and not expect 1 hour mcs etc.
---
boredom
---
The magic is gone and no matter how many times I try to get back into it is still the same farmville with slightly better graphics
---
They are bad, it's just how it is sadly. Some people play them for no particular reason, some just want to get raid gear without much effort, but I suspect most do it just to feel special or something like that.
---
There's 2 main reasons they get hate. First is they attract bad players. A subpar player performing a suboptimal spec makes things look way worse. The rets who pull 300+ dps regularly would be passable in most guilds, but finding a decent ret is 1/100 at best, let alone finding a good one. Furthermore, most rets are not good paladins in general. If they aren't cleansing, which most bad rets don't, their spot is even less useful than just doing bad damage. If they aren't good at healing then they can't do the one thing that would justify theit spot, and that's fill in for a sick healer.
---
Second is they only need the best gear from raids. AP rets want BRE and Onslaught Girdle. This means that the existence of an AP ret pally will deter good warriors from joining your guild. Most guilds with rets have mediocre warriors because that's all they attract. Holy Paladins also don't want to compete with rets for their offspec gear. That goes doubly for Spell Power rets who would be getting prio in their tier set. Most holy pallys do the job because they know it's how they can be the most useful to their guild, not because they want to wear dresses in PvP. The idea if bringing the worst dps in the game to your raid, to take items away from the best healers, other pallys, and the best dps in the game, warriors, is straight up suicidal.
---
The existence of ret is not only just a waste of a raid slot by any meaningful metrics, but it's also a good way to guarentee your guild deters high end players who have options. It's like a black hole dragging the quality of your guild down with it. Very few guilds can get away with running rets long term and they are usually the ones that are all friends to begin with. Most people will do a 180 when they see rets in a guild because they know.
---
It was an approximation of the small amount of time in which it takes for horde to completely ruin the experience of a player without any opposition or recourse. In that short session just on my 33 alt, I was repeatedly killed, checked if the coast was clear, rezzed and realize that they had hidden out of sight or stealthed, get chased by the higher levels on mounts into the next zone, kill me, repeat the cycle just to have a fresh new group that is starts all over again. There is enough horde that this can go on continuously. I don’t care if it was 20 minutes, 50 minutes, 1 hour... if you are going to nitpick over that then I don’t care. This happens on all my alts and on my 60 main as well. The point being that it’s no longer fun paying almost $16 ($15.89 with taxes, just in case you want to dispute that as well!) a month to play when you spend more time dead than alive every login and not much you can do about it except sit in a city unflagged, reroll or quit. 
---
And here’s a [shot]https://imgur.com/gallery/L1SemIn) of just how many horde will try to cram themselves into BRM after P2. This is just inside the mountain, not including the FP, the corridor to the mountain, the back entrance, etc.
---
It is a insanely powerful weapon that is not the most powerful weapon. That also costs 3k+ gold. Seems like a meme to me.
---
1) No, 5-10 slots is well enough for MC. For Ony you don't even need them) I get only 1-2 different gray drops from full MC runs. All rare items would be distributed by Loot master.  
---
2) Water should be provided by mages. Politely ask them, they will understand.  
---
3) PallyPower is very good for buffing different classes. But it require some initial setup.  
---
4) Nothing. Maybe disable auto-loot, in rare case you will be taking something from Majordomo chest.

I think more people would just quit playing and wouldn't complain as much because they weren't paying money
---
Lmao wasting gold on lionheart over t2 helm
---
It works so much better too. My first BRD run we had a mage with the key that knew where to go. We made it surprisingly far consider our low levels and awful gear.
---
Stop using wpvp as justification for being toxic.
---
How did a rogue get Sulfuras?
---
There's no addon that lets you view the talents of any random player without their consent. You can only see other people's talents if they have a compatible addon that lets you do it.
---
Details damage meter comes with this ability, it's on by default, so when you/inspect any other person who uses Details, you can see their spec. It's a very common addon and most people don't disable the talent sharing.
---
If you're in a position of authority in your raid you can mandate that everyone use Details and not disable talent sharing.

Taking one specific word and overextending its definition is not evolving language but in fact devolving it because now one word takes the place of dozens of other potential better-fitting words or phrases. But yes, you're right that language is fluid and ever-changing, but when the change is because of laziness or stupidity that irritates me.
---
There are two uses for one shot in the context of WoW. 
---
Completing something (boss kills or other tedious and easy to fail things) in one attempt or killing someone with one cast of an ability, more often than not within one global cooldown.
---
In the context of PvP, only the latter is applied. This isn’t killing anyone with a one shot, regardless of how entertaining it is.
---
Nope, no one knows. If you're gonna transfer do it sooner rather than later.
---
hmh ,it takes quite a few minutes from org to get to winterpsring or WPL, WSG entrance is nowhere near anything relevant, maybe AV entrance might be preferred as it is fairly close to WPL/EPL, but AV is worse honor? 
---
I don't know, we will see I guess, but the game will be far more playable for alliance tbh.
---
My vanilla experience was burning crusade for the most part and I only played a rogue and a druid to 20.  I'm loving it so far.  Just got to level 40 as a druid tank and loving it.  Although I bet I would like it a lot less if my gf wasn't there healing me all the time
---
If world PVP is all you want to do then do it. You will have less groups to do BGs with, less groups to do PVE with and there isn't really great big battles in PVP on Heartseeker from what I've seen.
---
My alliance groups have taken like 15-20 people into orgrimmar and had pretty much free run of the place. 
---
If you want to death ball as a group of 5 and hit solo players then you will have a target rich environment. If you want to have 5v5 battles you won't have many because when ever the horde death balls get caught they get swamped. Most seem to run in and get some HKs for like 5 minutes then fly to a new hub so they don't get got. When BGs come out nobody is gonna want to do this.
---
Nothing about what you described fits what a meme is.
---
As many have confirmed it's 30% damage done converted to healing gained. 
---
It's always worth it in pvp. The increase from 20% to 30% is essentially 50% more healing received compared to what you normally would get and only for 2 points. You won't come out from shadow form unless it's very big emergency so think that talent as extra stamina.
---
No, thanks
---
Is it a one shot if he gets killed by multiple tics of one extremely high damage dot?
---
Nice! I have a rogue almost full twinked for 49, was thinkin about druid next ;)
---
Why are you booing him? He’s right.
---
New concept...people learn better if you teach.
---
I use the nugrunning one and disabled the bars, that seemed to put the times in the icons for me, I think that's how I got them to work at least cause I tried a bunch of stuff as I'm sure you have as well.
---
&gt;five minutes
---
You know this is sped up, right? Look at the clock, starts at 9:18, ends at 9:58.
---
Saw this coming from the day they announced honor rewards and ranks would be coming before battlegrounds.
---
An image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations.
---
 Such as spending 3k gold on a suboptimal choice somebody else can use better just because its flashy.
---
You deal with it the same way you deal with what happens when you get aggro in literally every other situation, you run to where the tank is.
---
&gt; I passed on stonesplayer/rockpounder as an axe spec arms warrior (extra 5% crit from axes).
---
This seems like the right choice on paper, but in reality, Stoneslayer/Rockpounder have so much higher damage than Bonebiter that it outweighs the loss of 5% crit.
---
Bonebiter: 105 - 159
---
Rockpounder: 126 - 190 (+19%)
---
Stoneslayer: 133-200 (+26%)
---
So they have +19% and +26% top end damage, and +10% tooltip DPS. I'd say that's better than 5% crit.
---
Also rockpounder itself has 2% crit on it, so you're really only losing 3% crit from not having an axe.
---
9% is just for raids and the cap can be hit with a combination of class abilities and item skill ups.  It's specifically to get maximum hit on higher than 60 raid targets and bosses.  While in pvp you only ever go up against lvl 60s and 6% is considered good enough.
---
The issue is people playing this game with easy mode BiS lists, and don't understand that the BiS list is for raids not PvP.  In fact some PvP builds incorporate maximum quality stats... such as weighing in how much stamina and health bonuses vs how much damage loss.  In the end someone wearing Devil armor is probably a glass canon and an easier target to delete off the battleground.
---
There is a reason they call fury warriors... warrior rogues, and I've already seen a few fury warriors dissipating, because they honestly need constant support in PvP.
---
Lol. I get you want to rank but if you hate it that much, why even bother?
---
Ive barely played classic since p2, going to give it another shot when BGs release
---
There's no doubt that it's faster and more efficient to have a real prot warrior tanking, since you can save significant healer mana. 
---
I wouldn't recommend it simply because dps is not going to wait for you to get solid threat on multiple mobs and you'll need to boost your dps more than you'll need to reduce your incoming damage to play effectively.
---
Well when they have no alliance to fight, they've beat the game right?
---
Best way to farm honor right now on a Horde dominated server is this: Camp one player for 4 Honor Kills with most damage dealt to him and search for the next one
---
What's your server and faction ?
---
&gt; stating what the addon does
---
Nah you're lying about it. It doesnt show enemy coordinates. You can already see where your group is, spy isn't adding anything game breaking if it also gives team coordinates.
---
You the visual “swipe” duration?
---
Hunters and backpedaling. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Usually if one ally shows up in front of org most people will let them have fair duels in my experience.
---
Will Snapchat would probably be the best description, but wouldn't wonder if there is already something new though...
---
How is it a horde stronghold?
---
Transfers off are restricted to horde.
---
Combined with long queues, that has evened things up a bit.
---
I'm saying now might be a good time for a break, yes. I've definitely been leveling less as I know Ally are going to be out killing me.
---
Because world PVP is the main draw for me in WoW. Raids are a couple hours a week. And BGs get stale really fast. World PVP, when it exists, is dynamic and fun.
---
If you play so little and you are just playing pve and raid logging the mount has little value imho. Just buy the helm.
---
Shouldn't you be doing your homework then?
---
It can also be interpreted as one-combo’d. Notice how the guy never had a chance once the combo started
---
Curious if y'all ended up staying?  If you did what guild did you end up joining or are you still searching for a guild?  I'm curious because we've made a wow classic guild recruitment tool and have a page dedicated to the [Kirtonos server](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds/filter?server=Kirtonos) .  We'd love to have your feedback on it and your guild join us on there.  We currently only have 4 guilds for Kirtonos but with over 350 guilds across all the servers and growing daily, we're looking to get those numbers up!
---
Happy questing, raiding, and PvP,
---
ClassicRaids
---
&gt; the option between
---
Ok so they arent giving you the options you need, yes that's a problem. Faction queues isn't a solution either.
---
How long did it take to level to 60 only doing Dungeons?
---
I really don’t care.
---
I'm really enjoying my hunter, got to 60 a while ago. Swapped to engi, doing diremaul tribute runs, have 3/8 tier 1 etc. The only problem for me now is i'm not sure if i can learn a new set of abilties and binds for an alt.

I hit 60 as a shaman, loving the enhancement build. - short story -
---
going to join up for an arena run in BRD, on my way through the double doors a warlock was behind them waiting, he full dotted me and I dropped a tremor totem, blocking his fear, I dropped a grace of air totem on my way to corner him and one shotted him with a nasty WF full crit. Then I ate a big omelette on his corpse as I waited for the dots to fall off. Best moment in my troll career.
---
But all in all, I'm anxious to play now at 60. like I should be grinding end game gear and attunements but worry I don't have enough time to complete a run of what dungeon will drop healing or enhancement gear. So I'm here on reddit now trying to figure out where to go because the only way to get into a raid is to respec resto.
---
Rogue/Shaman is definitely a great combo.  MwHighlander is totally right.  Mage/Rogue can have some funny synergy but it won't be optimal.  Shaman/Rogue or Priest/Warlock would be my pick
---
Lmao my guild has 2 spriests, 2 arms warriors and 2 rets. We've got rag on farm. We're looking for a boomy next. We are in between casual and elitist.
---
Negative
---
Even if you were correct, and we established very clearly that you weren't since the weapon is insanely powerful (you said so yourself), that would still not be a meme in any possible way, taking your own definition of what a meme is.
---
He also changes the audio abit to remove the music so it doesn't get a copy right claim.
---
I went this route the other day, and assuming GY isn’t also camped, it’s actually pretty fast to land, get insta-gibbed, then take res sickness and slip along the north side of the map to BRM. If you’re alliance and have 100% chance of dying 3-5 times inside anyway, you lose the res sickness by the time you get to your instance and it doesn’t really matter for the pvp, because without sickness you’re still gonna get blown up on sight inside anyway.
---
Yep..you can also drop engi and just keep deathray, it doesny req engi at all
---
Yeah, wtf do you expect?
---
Free to play/new game right?
---
It is mildly amusing.
---
No I’m someone who feels sorry for people wasting time and gold to give warriors that weapon. If you have retri or enhancer in your guild and you give a warrior that weapon then you are the prick.
---
this is so fucking fascinating, i cant explain why. so cool this game has this complexity honestly. or i havent played enough mmos
---
obviously?
---
Are we playing the same game??
---
You’re a little bitch too? Geez. Listen, stop checking your phone and go back to tending to your customers at GameStop.
---
r/woosh
---
Well yeah but that makes them bad. Currently they are meh. Only working because the fights are short. This is what needs fixing. Just slap a -X% mana cost on boomkin form could already make them somewhat more viable
---
I think he’s thanking them for raiding IF gates instead of just deleting a contested zone rather than thanking for not pushing deeper in IF
---
There’s like 7 you can kill through the normal pickpocket route. Then every 15mins you reset. Get like 1 every 2 resets
---
Spy was nerfed so now you can just be sneaky and not get ganked nearly as much. The deathballs usually just ride up and down the main road. Some areas (Winterspring) are heavily farmed by 60s for rep, probably not cool hanging out there as alliance.
---
Check out the guidelime and guidelime_sage addons. I've only used a horde guide but it was pretty good, guides you to the most rewarding quests and how to do them efficiently so you don't have to travel as much.
---
No one cares lol
---
Love the game. I always played RuneScape as a kid because WoW was too expensive and I didn’t get an allowance or anything to cover the subscription fee. Now I have a 60 rogue and a 60 mage, plus a bunch of lower level alts to try out other classes (hunter, warlock, and druid so far). 
---
I’m a huge fan of WoW having a lot of content that requires a team, which is rare (mostly nonexistent) in RuneScape. Guilds feel important, and smooth, fast raids or dungeons are a group effort. 
---
Gameplay is relatively complex and has a high skill ceiling. I’m still learning each matchup in PvP, but I constantly have to be planning ahead and reacting to my opponent at the same time. In PvE, I mostly just spam sinister strike and eviscerate, but at the same time there’s a lot of nuance. Waiting for crusader procs to pop cooldowns, knowing when to vanish to drop threat, positioning properly during chaotic fights...Even in dungeons, maybe I want to slice and dice for attack speed as a mob is dying because we’re about to pull another pack and I don’t need eviscerate for the mob’s last 150 hp. 
---
I love professions. It’s cool to have to choose only two main professions and really be focused on a certain style of play. My rogue has engineering for PvP, and alchemy. I’ve learned every recipe, save one or two, for alchemy and save a boatload of money making my own raid consumables.
---
I think what makes me love this game so much is how varied my experience can be every time I log in. I can hop into a 25-40 man raid, or I can get on my mage and solo grind gold while I listen to music. I can pull up the AH on my bank alt and make some investments or pick up good deals for alchemy on my main. 
---
Logging in is always fun. That about sums it up, I guess. My only big regret is being Horde on a super skewed PvP server. I wish the faction populations were balanced and I knew more about it before rolling Horde on Skeram with some friends.
---
I left to a different server with better pop balance
---
Who cares? That isnt bad at all to deal out loot and full clear.
---
It means what I said. When they started changing classes in the name of balance they broke several of them. I played a holy priest and that class went from the preferred healer to third place behind paladins and then druids. Now with retail there is almost no class identity. It started in BC.
---
I think it does.
---
Sure but it's hard to find a regular crew when you're only spending 2hrs a day online.
---
Easy, spec to full prot and start tanking brd, make ur own group. That’s what i did, i respec to full prot and tanked dungeon from 53 to 60, then respec to 17/34 full fury for raid. Nvr had problem finding groups, i still tank all dungeons with full fury spec because it’s easy with all the tank gear i got from tanking from 53-60.
---
In the context of PvP, one-shot does not mean killing someone on first attempt.  
---
One shot means something specific, and people familiar with raiding can probably guess a new meaning, simply because they understand the traditional definition makes absolutely no sense.
---
lol, the engineering stuff does so much dmg, I 100% would have just let you attack, which seems like a bad call lol! How often does it work out?
---
It was the last time statistics have been fetched and what websites show.
---
Netomatic, Gnomish boots, Harm prevention belt and Mind control cap are all BOE
---
I'm not dodging anything, you are just dense as fuck.
---
Let's evaluate the three groups in your scenario:
---
- guy getting ganked must form a group to respond to ganking group
---
- ganking group has strength in numbers through grouping up
---
- multiboxer does not need to group with anyone, he is five people by himself
---
&gt; In both cases, 5 characters overwhelmed them, and in both cases that player would need to get a group together to fight them if they chose to do so.
---
In the first case that player is fighting five IRL people, and in the second they are fighting one IRL person with the combined strength of five characters because they paid more.
---
Good lord, what part of this is too difficult for you to understand?
---
Five people are five separate people, they are strong because they worked together to group up and increase their strength.  The multiboxer does not need to group with anyone, they have the advantages that usually come through a group simply by paying five times as much as a normal player.
---
&gt; It isn't your game, it isn't your decision, get over it.
---
Christ, it's an opinion.  I'm not picketing outside Blizzard's headquarters, chill the fuck out.
---
No, it's not my game and it's not my decision, and yet someway, somehow I am still capable of having an opinion on it.  Try not to have an aneurysm because of this.
---
You must know my friend Sssst
---
Nah, a meme does not fit the description here. You finding something funny is not enough to create a meme.
---
Written like a true Horde player.
---
Alliance has all of the story. Horde quests are just killing stuff for the sake of killing it. Elwynn/Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood in particular are incredible if you ever make an Alliance alt.
---
During phase 2 and toward the end I've been running under Ony and jumping so that I'm in melee range for Sunder Armor. For some reason you can actually hit her as melee when jumping while she's flying around. Have to be close/ under her. Just watch out for deep breath!
---
Stack a few sunders and when she lands you'll most likely have threat and it's a wrap.
---
no, i get it, people always get all smug and go "sounds like someone got pvped on a pvp server xd" when someone complains about getting camped or something, but they weren't complaining.
---
This is the typical hotw/ns build - minus dropping a point from hotw to put into nature's grasp for more pvp util. You'll be able to heal just fine in raids. Gift of nature is not crucial once you have a proper amount of +healing as it just affects your healing touch's base healing and since you'll be using lower ranks 3/4 and 7/8 a lot, it's not huge. I currently run 30/0/21 for PvP and I still parse very well in MC/Ony - I currently have +654 healing.
---
edit: Also, I recommend dropping some pts in imp enrage/rejuv/tranq spirit to get at least 4 pts in Nature's Focus for PvP. I didn't with my current spec, and I wish I did - it's infuriating trying to heal at times with pets and whatnot sitting on you. I'll probably do 5 nature's focus/1 rejuv/0 imp enrage/tranq spirit.
---
This is slightly dated now but maybe useful as a start.  I imagine the super lopsided servers are still that way.  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community)
---
Good guilds good
---
Pictures you can hear.
---
And at the end everyone will be so cool like their twitch stream gods...
---
Why? Because I am only on the top 5 of warriors on my server dps wise, or is it because I am only at the top 10 honor wise?
---
I deserve it probably more than you. Who are you to decide.
---
Most of the time I did spellcleave. I had just under 9 days played, with two maxed out professions, a couple 100 gold, and good enough gear to jump straight into MC. Another nice thing is that I can complete quests for extra gold rather than xp
---
Of course it was at random
---
How?
---
Is this horde only?
---
If you are horde and want to find consistent PvP, heartseeker is probably your best bet. Theres going to be 30-40min Qs for horde for BGs. All the ally are going to be perma instanced for the most part with near instant BG Qs. If you're on HSeeker, you'll have way more targets. If you have a good crew i imagine it would be more fun for you guys than on an overstuffed Horde dom server where the alliance dont venture into the world unless they have to.
---
Well go for arms warrior in pvp then.
---
The best weapon for ret is the pummler from gonmer come BWL and its spell damage gear.
---
Yeah I've even done it with a 60 warrior, 60 mage and 58 healer.
---
Not really hard at all.
---
horde are real cunts on that server..
---
It is a bit diff.  I attacked a 30 something warrior when i was about 9lvls higher (i think, don't exactly recall, but he was green).  He crit my lock 3 times in 3 hits for 600+.  I think he was decked out in SM gear by the looks of it.
---
As a rogue, it will be fun for you, but otherwise Heartseeker is just Stalagg with faction balance reversed.
---
uncoordinated group vs. sappers and mages? no enemy healers? cool
---
If you switch to sub, you won’t have too many stealth issues. Rogues are fun and do great damage and burst. I’d say keep chugging along and once you hit 40 and get decent weapons, it won’t be so bad.
---
Why do you mean by farm brd? If you talking around arena/angerforge farm, yes u can do it, but you better have a mage for aoe. If you have some wierd composition that has no aoe and spell interrupt u gonna have a hard time, at least very inefficient. Mobs in brd, they will cast heal spell and they run away when their hp is low.
---
Big deal?
---
Still plenty of situational abilites in retail, what are you on about lmao
---
Also some specs you're gimping yourself pretty hard if you just push whatever comes off CD without any thought behind it
---
Hahaha dang. Well, you win some you lose some. It is just a game but that still really sucks.  Don’t beat yourself up over it. Lesson learned.
---
I cannot even get into BRD anyway it takes like 15 corpse runs
---
I'm guessing part if it is he didn't include the times he missed attacks in the video
---
^([cough](https://youtu.be/3NUIrVivPhs) )

I feel like people should be able to post whatever they want as long as they don’t repost 1k times a day

Elementals that bleed.
---
Gold bars are worth less than gold. 
---
Fireball works underwater/Frostbolt works underlava.
---
Undead are not undead, but humanoids.
---
People that roll on PvP servers and complain about PvP.
---
What bad rep have they acquired? Skeram horde player here
---
I never see this mentioned so here is the secret, farm pristine yeti hides in feralas, turns into an nod at feathermoon for rep

This horse has been beaten to a bloody pulp.

This is why Druids are the best PvP healers. Don't need anyone to keep you alive, just cast HoTs and run.
---
I have killed them before when they also had 2 other 60s sitting on top by duke camping it so no ally could get in.
---
A lot of people in this thread think its funny.
---
I’m sorry I didn’t read the whole thing because... wow. Times are weird these days... I get you have social anxiety but to even talk to people in a video game? Maybe this game will be good for you because it sounds like you need some help on the social part lmao.

My favorite were the last two lmao
---
No kidding, spanish primary schools teach 2 to 4 languages starting at 6 years old
---
Lightning bolts and fireballs work underwater.
---
&gt; and for all warriors: keep your healers happy or they leave and it sucks to suck in 1v1
---
What makes you think we warriors can do ANYTHING in this world pvp environment? Unless it's an extremely small skirmish and we have a healer, we're basically just fodder :(
---
AV has a pretty easy grind and nice loot. There will be plenty of alliance queuing
---
Most ghosts (not all) and some (like...70%) of elementals are immune to bleed effects. So no rend. No deep wounds etc.
---
Correct
---
Those whispers...oooooooooooOOOOOOOOO
---
Yes that’s a repeatable quest, gives ~2500xp, 70 silver and i think 100? rep on every turn in
---
Click the pristine yeti hide in your inventory to start the turn in qst
---
The only problem is it drops in a yeti cave that’s quite a way away from the feralas inn, so it’s not worth it since you can carry only one yeti hide at a time
---
Glacial stone is marginally better but I prefer the axe for aesthetics
---
I think its fitting that for something called "twinks"  gnomes are the most popular
---
In my opinion guards in cities and villages needs to be buffed. There is more horde players in Theramore then guards. And on top of that they deal like 120 dmg per hit.
---
2 things:
---
1. I am extremely stubborn and refuse to give up (in this case refuse to not get inside UBRS)
---
2. It was a jed/rend run and I was the only one who would roll on dal'rend main hand if it dropped, which doesn't happen often :P
---
The whining about pvp happening on pvp servers doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
Throwing out opinions that are way off make you look dumb brotha.
---
BGs regardless of faction with be a few minutes because its crossrelm BGs
---
rag/golemag/baron/magmadar/garr(excluding aoe padding) are all fights where warlocks consistently beat mages.  That's half of molten core.  The only time mages pull ahead is during any of the cleave encounters for obvious reasons.
---
Yea my bad, I wanted to reply to another thread. Not op's. That's why it made no sense
---
Weren't undead classified as actual undead at one point but they removed it?
---
Don't bother, these people aren't receptive to reason. That's why the "I need gold so I roll need" meme exists.
---
The economy being so tight really just brings out the worst in people, sadly. Try and play with people who don't have that mentality as much as possible.
---
I was in your exact same position, UD rogue on Skeram and transferred just before p2 knowing how boring it was about to be. 
---
Personally I love the outnumbered wpvp aspect of it, I truly feel immersed in my class for once having to sneak around everywhere, ambush people when I can and escape. It's also not hard to find people to roam with if you want a little more security. It seems their numbers have made alliance cushy, only a few seem to put up a good fight. They will almost always outnumber you and win in numbers instead. Certainly a few good ones to watch out for though. 
---
Certain areas are permanently camped by groups of alliance, like Kargath, BRM, and even Org gates and portal area. As a rogue however getting around without dying shouldn't be too hard for you.

I was in a raiding guild with all content on farm on Skeram, but am having a hard time finding a good replacement here. Seems like either entire guilds transferred over, in which case they don't need more players, or you're trying to get into a guild that's been here a while, who don't seem to have progressed as far as the average horde guild on other servers. Also finding groups for dungeons is much harder, if not impossible for certain ones. Getting there will suck for your non stealthing party members. 
---
Overall I'd say if you're 60, well geared, looking for pvp, and don't mind being outnumbered (by a lot), take the transfer. If you're still running dungeons regularly, or not super interested in pvp, stay put.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Thank a bunch
---
Agreed. I feel like no one is gonna stop leveling to do pre-60 bgs this time around. People are too fixated on leveling as fast as possible to do something that rewards no xp. Any sub 60 bracket will be filled with twinks, which can be interesting, but most people who think dont do it for a fair fight.
---
If you're going to play classic WoW, be social and don't play on a PvP server unless you like being ganked a lot while levelling.
---
Most of it's issues (ie "rogues and warriors are hard to level") come down to the player base refusing to make friends and group up. It's design dates back to when the "holy triangle" was tank, heals and crowd control, and so classes are generally designed to be good at one thing. The solution for this is grouping off friends lists and guilds.
---
Tanks find it much easier to get groups. Classic has more players picking healers than Vanilla did.
---
Apart from that, have fun :)
---
It is known.
---
I went there because I tried playing for the first couple months without add-ons or guides and was desperately in search of quests at my level
---
Rogue or mage
---
dawg I make more than you ever will calm down

also you're soft as fuck, quit crying

Turtles parrying my attacks as a cat
---
There is an addon called Azeroth Auto Pilot which does, well exactly what it sounds like. I havent used it myself but I've used a similar type of guide just web-based and it makes for a very quick and mindless levelling experience
---
Healing is so easy you can pretty much carry on a conversation, play with your dog, watch TV and drink a beer and still heal.
---
This comment describes American laziness.
---
It's practically impossible to do all the quests in certain areas in one pass, unless you only grind monsters in the zone in-between those quests. Quite a few zones have varied level ranges and same for quests, one of the most notable being Stranglethorn Vale stretching from the low 30s all the way up to 50. I would say in general you're much better off doing what quests you can in the 2, 3, or 4 zones appropriately leveled, and pass back around later. There are tons of quests that send you to other parts of the continent or even the other continent entirely, so sticking around to quest or level there a bit can make sense.
---
All the sawmill buildings have their saw blade installed incorrectly.
---
It would make a lot more sense if they were named correctly as "ganking servers".
---
Lmao, OK buddy. I'm sure you slid out of the womb in full T1 gear too

Thank you! i love the concept of natures focus but everyone seems to be hating on it, i am considering putting at least 2 points in natures focus keeping one on imp enrage and all in imp rejuv. maybe one more from imp enrage, have to think about it. (but 1 imp enrage seems really great for a quick charge/stun combo or a nice help for tanking or do you thing its not necessary?)
---
Spy prevents us from doing this
---
I have no idea what this comic is trying to make a joke out of.
---
Low hanging fruit about mages having basically no rotation. Or that competitive guilds shouldn't care about Min maxing raids because they want to be fast?
---
For the latter competitive guilds need to be specific for their main raid team. No point in keeping people who are lacklustre or use meme specs, and gear them up.
---
&gt;Or hop around from area to area and just do the quests that are available to you?
---
This is my method, I try to optimize my travel so that I visit things at little as possible (e.g. a quest requires you to go SW &gt; Darkshire &gt; Southshore &gt; Darkshire, I'll try to do quests in between rather then just doing that one quest to maximize my XP for the time there).  
---
If you have an addon called Questie, it makes it very easy, I typically go into a zone, pick up all the yellow/orange quests available and check the map. There will be locations where 2-3 quests are and I'll typically hit that place first and try to get a bunch out of the way before proceeding to the next ones.  
---
When I'm out of yellow/orange quests, I go to the next area and typically I choose that by finding out which quest in my log asks me to visit a similar-level area.
---
If you sort of 'cycle' through the areas like this, leveling up feels relatively quick and since you're constantly moving and have tons of quests available, it's rarer that you get camped since you can easily just leave an area and go to another.
---
nice thank you, any spec details you prefere?   
---
what do you think about natures focus?
---
Wow that mage was so terrible. They should've been able to 3 shot you but kept spamming arcane missiles lol.
---
&gt; Waiting for prey to walk by, then kill them 3 times and go back to the spot watching Netflix.

&gt; World PVP, when it exists, is dynamic and fun.
---
Roll alliance then. Seriously. What's wrong with you?
---
For pvp, stam &gt; int &gt; spi &gt;sp
---
For solo farming, int &gt;stam &gt;spi &gt;sp
---
For raiding or even dungeons with a good group, sp &gt; anything else, and given the choice between more spell power or gear with frost damage vs anything else (except high mp5 values) you pick the spell power
---
How do you know? Because it feels like it? If you are leveling as horde it feels exactly the other way around, at both sides it’s kinda impossible to do quests, because you get stomped by a raid.
---
Does using abilities like sinister strike mess with auto attack timing?
---
Aww that's too bad.  I haven't had the displeasure of having to deal with that addon yet.
---
Nice irrelevant fact I guess?
---
I was so sad when I realised this
---
As a warrior I run alone on purpose. Damage done increases honor gain, I basically oneshot everything I touch (and crit), so I get 150 honor killing at flight paths.
---
The only 1on1s I lose are against warlocks or other warriors. Most mages dont know how to counter insignia, FAP &amp; spider belt.
---
Since I have done that I doubled my honor an hour
---
Your other posts made me suspect you hadn't even looked at Retail in a long while but now I'm certain of that, you should atleast do some research before making absurd statements such as ''PvP is nonexistent''
---
War Mode, zone events, arenas and battlegrounds are all things that are heavily populated
---
Same here. As soon as alliance fight back with equal numbers the horde doubles there in 10 mins
---
Which build are you playing and how long has it been since you’ve updated your weapon(s)?
---
Melee classes are extremely dependent on keeping an updated weapon, so if yours is outdated you’re kill time is going to be slower and you’re going to have to stop and regen more often.
---
Additionally, are you doing quests that are at/below your level? If you’re fighting mobs that are above your level, you’re going to have a bad time.
---
Very relevant and the fact that you can't see that proves my point
---
amen, new warrior to WoW and some people just expect you to do it all right.. but for every one of them there’s handful who help .. interesting balance
---
That's fair enough, though I suggest buying some lesser invisibility potions and coming up from the south to reduce your deaths
---
A tabard like the SM one and a shirt would go a long way to making him look better.
---
I am going to assume this is after hundreds of encounters, and selective edits gave us this result. However, it is definitely the best possible outcome to capture.

Non-thirsty players just standing there in awe, and getting a good laugh out of the whole thing.

You'll get them when ZG comes out in phase 4.
---
Just re-roll horde on a PvE server so you can quest efficiently in peace as a duo
---
Yeah I think undead even had access to the "Common" tongue in Beta, because they were effectively just humans that became undead. I believe this was removed very early on, and there's a somewhat famous screenshot of an undead mage in beta using invisibility and yelling for Alliance in Goldshire to "come across the bridge".
---
The principle of the fact that someone from the opposing faction just killed one of your buddies
---
Alliance in whitemain, about to quit cause it isn't fun having 45 min runs to BRD or UBRS. Can't do anything in the open world, not even durring off hours because half the horde live in thaiwon. It was fun boys but not anymore and now that I haven't played in a week I realize what a waste of time it was.
---
I don't want to relevel? You really think the answer is abandoning the 12 days played time I have on this character and spending another 6-7 on a new alliance? No.
---
The point of the post is PVP barely exists as horde on Skeram. I'm considering transferring to Heartseeker, and I'm looking for input from players there.
---
Thanks for your input though I guess...

I enjoyed the warlock who is chasing him down, uses life tap, and then starts running away like a little girl after realizing he just fucked up.

You are what is wrong with this game!
---
&gt; Warriors are the worst. I swear, they just charge without even glancing at the rest of the group's bars, location, or even their own health bar. All they look at is the goddamn rage bar.
---
&gt; Healer ended last pull with 4% and is sitting drinking? Rest of group oom and no one is topped off? Warrior only has 40% health? Warrior leaves the room breaking LoS on healer, charges into pack and dies. Then the warrior says the healer sucks.
---
&gt; Or, warrior decides to dual wield tank in strat. Pulls all the fatties without leaving combat once, rest of group pops consumables to stay afloat. Group wipes on all the normal mobs that come rushing out? Everyone's fault but the warrior. Warrior doesn't put on shield, dies when the elite skellies come out of the slaughter house? Everyone else's fault.
---
&gt; Warriors are the worst
---
&gt; At this point I only run with warrior tanks as a last resort in dungeons. I'll take a paladin or druid tank over a warrior any day of the week in a five man, because they know that Epstein didn't kill himself. I've had exactly one bad druid/paladin tank, and I run with druid/paladins way more than I run with warriors. But 9/10 warrior tanks I run with suck. The only ones I've found that compete with druid/paladin tanks in five man's are my guilds raid tanks....
---
There are just way way way more horde. Look at the ratio of PvP to PvE servers.
---
I expected him to do something cool and unique...not just plop a few engineering items down.
---
Lol doubtful, GameStop fucking clerk
---
This reads like a post from r/wowcirclejerk honestly.
---
In what possible way is the number of times you killed Jed remotely relevant... I guarantee I've killed onyxia and rag more times then so I guess that's relevant to somehow...
---
I believe the term you are looking for is “40v1 servers”.
---
Pathetic. Log back in and pump those numbers up.
---
These came in late in vanilla. Part of it was tied into ZG rep, I think brilliant wizard oil needed honored. I’m not sure what patch they were added though, if it was after the cutoff. 
---
So it might be a phase thing, or may have missed the cutoff.
---
Bloodstrike dagger is better than demon blade, I'm sure someone listed demon blade and everyone copied them. There are several other equivalent items.

Negative honor for lowbies would unfortunately incentivise cheesy strats like carrying a bunch of low-levels around in your zerg in order to punish the opposite faction with negative honor for using AoE.

Open pvp is just cancer x.x

People also assume there will be a high uptime on three stacks.

They should just offer TBC as a separate entity. Allow people to copy their classic character if they wish.

cool story, still enjoyed killing you at silithus.

1. They could be new as well.
---
2. You can watch the video once then watch it as you progress through the dungeon.
---
For me it will. I've been locked inside DM since phase 2 released as I play on alliance on a horde dominated server. I currently have a lot of gold and I am just waiting for BGs to release so I can farm my rank 10 then just raid log. So yes, for me wpvp is over.
---
I went Q’S—&gt;Mount—&gt;Lion hat, Still working on the hat. 
---
Q’S is getting cheaper, but the arcanite and the mount won’t drop in price (assuming you have the rank 3 discount. It’s just about what you’ll actually get value out of. I’m loving the epic mount I got, but honestly I didn’t do that much open world beforehand. 
---
Lionheart is sick, and it’s a nice status symbol, so I think you’ll get satisfaction out of that. I’d say make your hat, then farm the mount.
---
It is unique... There's only one.
---
To add for people following bis lists like it’s life or death. Don’t just follow them blindly. Look at the stats.
---
This is the dumbest post iv'e ever read. Horde dominate most servers this is statistics.
---
I should have known anyone insane enough to pull this off woulda been Rextroy
---
Indeed, I tried to make it as r/classicwow friendly as possible.
---
Obviously that's how twinks work. Most 19 twinks have more HP and damage than level 30s so it's not impressive beating people 10 levels higher. The point I was making is that if some of your opponents were decently geared, you would have lost because of lack of skill. You running around with double crusaders and other high level enchants beating levels 20-30 is not impressive considering the fact that your gear and weapons outrank their levels.
---
Cheers for that correction. 
---
I've just googled it to confirm because I was pretty  certain  I was right.  I blame it on my local area, it's pretty common round here to say things like "I would of done that...".
---
Lol this a terrible excuse
---
Yeah sure, fair enough. I'll do one thing for a bit, get bored, then do something else.
---
I dunno mate, I know some people can just farm the same thing for 12 hours straight. I just prefer to do one thing for a few hours, watch a movie whilst I do it, then level an alt or something.
---
Shaman/Warlock is very good.
---
I guess the Italian sausage plays the part of the mystery meat?
---
Didnt that come with the prepatch for cata?  I seem to recall the leather bracers from Saurfang being BiS for warriors at the time.
---
Unrelated, what’s the add on for your nameplate and bars to be like that?
---
Healing is easy, just blame the tank if someone dies.
---
(Kidding...)
---
40yo neckbeards only please, just so we can make this cunt happy

What happened here
---
Its because the contraction is 'would've' which sounds a lot like 'would of'.
---
Either I guess. I miss arena and smaller raid sizes. I'd play BfA if it was enjoyable but it's so fucking bad. Might level an alt in classic for bgs, but not sure how that will go with the death squads.
---
I have the same problem with people IRL so I'm use to it.
---
Just sucks it’s so fast
---
Oh really? Cause i just scrolled through the top 1000 dps players in the world.. 27 mages. 0 warlocks.
---
Is that a legit cookbook for world of Warcraft? Please let me in on this. I’m a chef and I want this book lol
---
I don’t remember that, I just remember holy abilities doing 2x more damage to undead players and it being a pretty major issue, so the simple fix was to just make them tagged as humanoid.
---
Someone in my guild told me that if I re-spec from enh to anything else, I’ll lose all of my skill from 2h weapons. Is that true?
---
I grinded 57-60 on the owlbeasts south of Everlook in Winterspring 2 days after honor went live. Other than the occasional gank squad it was relatively quiet.
---
Warrior from our group did that shit and learned really quick when I just watched him die, any DPS that splits off but still wants to be part of the group is literally just screwing over the group especially the healers.
---
Must be pretty good for you to feel the need to comment!
---
Well unfortunately leveling an alt isn’t an efficient method of generating gold so you’re outta luck pal

Break that down for me, please. You can do it 5 times per hour. So that's 24g per run with each run lasting 12min.
---
I got it as a gift, but I’ve looked up the price - definitely worth it - over 200 pages full of many recipes for sides, breads, sweets, mains, desserts and even drinks! It’s very well put together, great art, and all the recipes follow the theme of WoW and cooking. Having loads of fun eating “Shoveltusk steak” or “Honeymint tea” instead of just plain old steak or tea. 
---
One downside ( for me, of course ) is that where I live some of the products are a bit harder to get, and some measurements aren’t “a teaspoon” or “a cup” but “12 ounces” which doesn’t mean much to me, lol.
---
Re-use the models from Reforged.
---
This is such weird logic... So if something isnt the #1 best thing.... It's not good? By that logic literally everything in the game is shit except for a couple of pieces
---
Hahaha, mystery solved - it was pork all along!
---
As a shadow priest pvp main I think this is a good answer but please note you will get frustrated often with your mana as a beginner.
---
It's the sharding for each zone.  You lag anytime you enter a new zone.
---
Just because people twink doesn't mean there isn't any skill involved. When one person twinks, another person twinks. Eventually, it will turn into twinks vs twinks and the most skilled twinks win.

I’m sure he can, but could a hunter take down 10x mobs at the same time? They’ve got 1,900 HP each and it looks like multi-shot has a 10s cooldown.
---
I don't think anything fun comes from autos, especially when they can be missed/dodged/parried so often.
---
When one of the core things to watch with your class is the weapon swing timer, you know the mechanics are bad.
---
Alliance needs to stop acting out too. No idea why this subreddit is of the belief that only horde are assholes.
---
yo pandaria was amazing
---
Why would it do that ? If u put an item here, it stays here until moved. If u pick up new items they will just fill in the very next spit available.
---
everywhere its just aoe farming mages and spellcleave runs
---
There's nothing special. IIRC only Core Hounds have some nasty debuffs. But since not every healer class could remove them - some are removing, some continue healing.
---
Do you know a hunter who would willingly just stand there spamming wingclip? :D

Did you really not discern that he meant either ds or sm ruin?

This sub is so full of casuals that want attention it’s annoy at this point.
---
No situational abilities? Are you even playing the same game?
---
Nearly every class has situational abilities.
---
Compare a classic mage to retail, I'm sorry but retail is far more situational, and if you "push whatever comes off CD and glows" you are absolutely playing it wrong.
---
It's like that shooting scene in MiB. Who doesn't belong? The level 36 strolling around outside town in Winterspring.
---
Well I'm 60 with 300 +shadow damage and I crit between 1350-1450. So ya, unless this guy has 500 +damage at 53 he isn't doing 1400 crits.
---
If you look at overall server population there is more horde than alliance. That's just a fact.
---
I mean, you have the choice to be kind or to be hateful, I don't know why you'd choose the latter.
---
I... would probably fail somewhere in that method and mess up too often to make the time spent worthwhile. If me and another rogue could duo it, I'd prolly make it. I'm not a min/maxer but I do wanna have most of the bis i can.
---
no you're there to MS things
---
That's an interesting chili. Doesn't sound half bad, how was it?
---
I wish it was more elitist, people showing up to raids in ZF greens expecting to get loot is infuriating.
---
Oh god no the beginning of the wow sub
---
Idk that hasn’t really happened to me on my server, I play in rattlegore
---
I might have to stick with the rogue farm group then. Idk. I normally make a deal with warriors to do arena for their savage piece and I get my trinket.
---
Lmfao
---
No everybody has those now
---
Thanks for the engi write-up, saving this for later.
---
Great vid though, looks like you got some salty alliance downvoting it though. They are doing that to mine too lol
---
Well that's definitely true.
---
Ya you suck, guy.
---
Lol, the horde have no girls.
---
Try to think of yourself as a hybrid caster/melee rather than a melee spec. You need to embrace the casting and the support spells, and once you do (if you still like it), it is a great class.
---
But, if you just want an axe, Warrior is better
---
Wrong.
---
I bet you couldn't even hit 2k if you tried, good thing classic has no measure of ranked system apart from farming honor right?
---
Go play a mage in retail, then go play a mage in classic.
---
It won't be an issue when theres more horde playing than alliance in general? It's only going to get worse as more alliance leave after being camped into oblivion.
---
Anyways I can't tell the future but based on the trend horde are going to have massive BG queues, and it's only going to grow worse over time if this trend continues.
---
Hm. I will try this also perhaps.
---
Boot polish?
---
Mate, it's your beloved communists that are the bad guys here, not Blizzard. Free Hong Kong, sure, but what does that have to do with a gaming company?

If you want to find the people responsible look no further than the western intellectuals openly and brazenly promoting marxism. A rotten ideology that has killed and tortured far, far, far more people than anything else in the modern era.
---
I advise you to consider that the extra attack can proc chance on hit effects as well like WF, enchants and unique weapon effects. That makes it inherently better than flat crit or AP to me.
---
Yeah I read about it today. But I highly doubt that the price will drop like crazy. When it goes from \~18g to 12-14g each, I am still happy AF!
---
Did you give silver to yourself
---
Not a bad idea. Still very lucky on the drop.
---
To be fair, they didn't think everyone would wear devilsaur.  For the most part though, gear is pretty cohesive.  People only look goofy until they get epics, then most classes look pretty normal.
---
Overall I prefer a bit of ugliness to having to look at people's shitty anime transmog or whatever.
---
Seeing as the first guy is still in the leveling process, and SM/DS is an actual spec. No he probably didn't.
---
You're reading a lot of anger into my answer that simply isn't there. It's just really, really, fun to see people join the winning team, knowing they'll outnumber the other side, ganking 10v1 and then moaning that it's boring for you. No shit.
---
If Classic WoW is your first experience with WoW and you went in blind then I'm sorry that you picked the wrong faction. But every, single, person that has been on here prior to launch knew that horde would outnumber alliance by a large margin and that world pvp would be incredibly unfair 9 times out of 10 in favor of horde. Still those same horde players that knew they'd have an unfair advantage over alliance is moaning that being guaranteed to win every encounter is actually boring in the long run. No shit.
---
What´s your opinion on [This talent tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxcux0hoZxVbdVMhx) for full Enh-shaman? Planning to go full Strength/Atk power with hit cap.
---
I got the karazhan mount on my 4th run, the utgarde pinnacle one my 2nd, and even old ironjaw in just a few casts... but this trinket has it out for me. And plenty of others I've seen.
---
When I saw Orgrimmar in the thumbnail I thought you were just getting HKs on 1hp Horde who had lost duels. But this... this is really impressive.
---
There is no warlock raid spec that does not include ruin.
---
Maybe if you’re giving them at least two or more. If you’re trying to trade them a single tune that isn’t really a tip. You’re just covering their cost. Pay them for their time too cheapskate.
---
Hahaha I ofcourse meant this .. not sure yet on which one of the two.
---
Oh look another person who didn't read
---
Sulfuras isn't very good for warriors compared to other weapons.
---
Yes as someone else said only if you're giving multiple - otherwise you're implying their time and effort is worth nothing
---
Hey there, it’s actually pretty doable, I rolled rogue, my friend rolled enh shammy, it’s doable but it would take a little longer than say a tank/heal or dps/heal team, we rarely found dungeon groups, or were having a hard time finding people to join our dungeon groups. But eventually after 10days played time, we got to 60. 
---
Early levels will be a tad slow, then around 35-40 it picks up (in my experience, I was running sub build) and with p2 out now, you could stealth and make him bait an ally and get honor as well. But it’s fun, you’ll be limited with mobility though, since shammy gets ghost wolf and your sprint is once every couple of minutes till you get a mount.. but it was fun and enjoyable for both of us at least. Now I’m rolling Druid and he’s going mage.
---
I don't understand why so many people are acting like this was the normal vanilla experience. It was not like this, not even close. At some points in time you had something like this happen, and it was glorious when it did, but it wasn't a 24/7 farm on every member of the Alliance that steps foot in any lvl50+ zone.
---
At this point is it even fun? It's basically just a mindless grind for Horde. Alliance just get more efficient at death walking around since there's no hope of fighting back 1v10 odds. 
---
One day there's gonna be High Warlords running around that are absolutely terrible at PvP because they won't have any experience fighting enemies that can actually fight back
---
O look another person who takes a 15 year old game way too fucking seriously
---
Actually that's a good question, I don't know.
---
I just got edgemasters and have mount but still want QS and hat, might end up farming QS myself though.
---
Lol right on
---
Most BiS lists are hot garbage so I wouldn't put much stock in them at all.
---
As I said, if you went in blind having no experience of WoW whatsoever before launch then that's just shit luck. But it isn't, is it? You're played WoW before this and I'll bet you knew very well everything I said, because it's not exactly news.
---
Then again I'm sure you'd be even more cross if you did roll alliance because if there's something that sucks more than being bored while looking for the next player to gank, it's being that player you gank.
---
Yea, I think that was the obvious bit.
---
1g is the expected tip for a town to town portal. Anything less than that and people think your cheap, unless you are a fresh lowbie. 
---
80s + rune is the same end result but you waste your time time grabbing a rune.
---
50s + rune is the secret to saving 30s without looking cheap, since the rune shows you respect their upfront cost.
---
1g + rune is the sorta thing 'nice guys' do.

My first WoW experience and I can say I love it. I’ve probably run LBRS 100 times and still never seen the Quartermaster drop my hands of power. Lost the roll on Briarwood Reed 4 times so far. The thing is, I just feel behind the rest of my raid group so I’ve stayed spec’d for winters chill since they’re all hardcore. My RL friend takes it super serious and got us into the most hardcore guild on the server. Now I’m getting the second job feeling too, grinding Fire elementals so I can make fire prot pots to sell. Got my epic mount and that helped me feel on par. MC is finally dropping mage gear so in PvE I’m one of the most geared mages in the guild but we have about 10 casters in line for a mageblade that hasn’t dropped once in our 7 weeks of MC. Despite this, the community and learning of mechanics has kept me going, 
---
I’m super competitive so pvp is my new calling but I wasn’t prepared like the hardcore people in guild. Cool thing is, I’ve felt like I’m still learning the pvp play style quickly despite not being an engineer. 
---
Love the game, just wish I didn’t have to grind for gold and when you complain about it, everyone goes. “Just farm ZF zombies, you’re a mage. It’s so easy.” To be honest, I don’t seem to have the gear or maybe it’s my spec but even with 10k mana I’m running out with the zombies having nearly a third of their health left sometimes. Or one resists a frost nova and I don’t notice till it’s too late. Maybe I just need to practice it more but I get frustrated.
---
Where can I find level 54 mobs to train my weapon skill?
---
People who corpse camp at BRM dont got girlfriends mate
---
It's likely that no one else knew what they were doing either.
---
A combination of things can produce a one shot. Like a soulfire that crits for 11k. You kill them in "one shot" but it requires set up to work and is reliant on multiple spells to actually work, thus, "combo".
---
This post is for me to see player base opinion on Multi boxing for upcoming Battlegrounds and generate a discussion.
---
can u sell me ur guid
---
That was my biggest gripe about tanking, especially in vanilla when tanking was significantly harder. I'm already doing the job most people avoid, so dont expect me to know every square inch of the dungeon.
---
I have spoken.
---
He killed them before they had any chance to react. Theyre sitting in a CC for the duration of the combo. It effectively is a one shot
---
I'm not too sure about this tbh. Everywhere I go as horde there are multiple alliance waiting at the entrance to a dungeon/flight point/zone ready to gank and dominate us. Last census I saw it said it was balanced with slight favor towards horde, so either the horde on this server are all pussies, or ally just dominate here.
---
Huh.
---
When one kid wins the fight and he starts looking at everyone else
---
Isn't it more obtuse to deny the fact that the original formatting could leave the guy above us slightly confused about which spec he is going, since SM/DS is a viable spec for things like solo content and large scale pvp?
---
I mean all I really did was try to get you to see a new perspective from the guy you were trying so hard to put down. Isn't that like the opposite of obtuse? Dare I say.. *acute*
---
Forgetting about BWL frien.
---
If you plan to raid on your warrior finish your mage and use it to generate income for you. Do stratholme so you can get the AoE set (Necropile) and then camp ZF
---
I think I'm about level 24 and apart from the water totem quest I've been having a blast playing shaman/horde for the first time.  Are there any important gear pick ups while leveling?
---
As a male tauren I also travel naked to assert dominance on gankers.
---
Damn, it's 15. Lol
---
You can gain weapon skills of any mob regardless of level.
---
The two easiest methods are the mobs in blasted lands (Requires you to heal periodically), or the ghosts in Dire Maul (Can afk 1-300 skill over a few hours).
---
Yep same here.
---
lol sell me ur luck xD
---
Conc blow is the only actual warrior ability that matters here. Big crits from a slow 2h really help, but realistically you could do this with a rogue almost as easily.
---
The struggle is real, keep fighting.  You'll learn the dungeons before too long and you'll know the mechanics.  Don't let the people who really should be playing retail try to rush you through dungeons.  People in Classic didn't play chase the tank near as much as they do now.
---
Whitemane ally here! On week 1, the Horde were extremely aggressive camping all of the eastern kingdom high lvl zones FP's and the menethil harbor boats. Not going to lie, the Ally were pretty pathetic week 1. Our server supposebly has a 45A/55H ratio, but we believe it's more 40A/60H, especially in regards to pvp. 
---
Week 2 comes around, and I swear the tables have turned. The Horde are a lot more passive and us ally have gotten tired of their crap and will KOS.
---
Now the Horde run from us and think twice about attacking IMO. Our guild gets pretty bored now, so when we hear one of our guildies are having trouble leveling or grinding mobs for quests, oh boy they're in for a surprise... It's actually been pretty fun. On the Tuesday night reset night, all of the hardcore raid guilds apparently hungout at BRM and prevented the Horde from getting into the mountain to the point where MC raids were porting to Orgrimmar. You can only poke the bear so many times before it mauls you to death :)
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Steal their waifu pillows
---
The enh tree is pretty standard for 30 enhance points. I'm not sure I'd give up faster fire nova explosion or bigger earthbind under the assumption this is mostly intended for pvp with points in better totems for raid value. Fire nova especially since you're putting points into improving it already, and leaving it out makes it more likely some hunter manages to pick it off before it explodes.
---
Your other option is a tri tree setup, because the hybrid hit from resto is really nice. But enh talents never quite manage to get everything you really want in 2 trees.
---
If you’re putting 30 points into holy you can spec reduced knock back along with imp righteousness. With 20 I’d go with improved righteousness instead of the reduced knockback. (Seal and judge are your only form of single target threat generation, +15% damage is essentially +15% agro generation)
---
Reckoning is bugged and doesn’t work all the time and is not worth picking for a pve build. Unfortunately the pro’s outweigh the con’s of being hitcapped (which in turn reduces agro generated by having less blocks) meaning you should stack as much defense as you can without hindering your agro. 
---
A little known detail about Paladin’s is that your yellow hits from SoR count as melee hits essentially making your chance on hit items double. This makes weapons like flurry axe insanely strong.
---
Good Prot pally items to go for are
---
Naglering- defense and the extra threat generated
---
Deathbone set- defense and mp5
---
Briarwood reed- one of your key spellpower items boosting agro
---
Sprite caster cape- spellpower
---
Too bad you will never be in that position to make those decisions and I'm smarter and more accomplished than you. Broke bitch
---
you're inferior to me in every way let's just be real
---
Zeppelins have guards on them while boats are literally empty
---
For sure. Engineering is designed to be the pest profession if money isn't important, and the worst profession if it is.
---
That ain't going to keep our healer alive :(
---
Everyone likes different things but I personally love playing a rogue. In pvp the feeling of being able to burst people in back lines and disappear and using guerilla tactics to throw off teams feels super rewarding to me. Even in small world pvp skirmishes being able to sap a member of a group and keeping 3 of them distracted looking for me while my team picks off stragglers is awesome. PVE build is also rewarding because you can do some great damage and getting off a good blade flurry is awesome. That being said leveling is rough and at times made me want to quit. I reccomend combat while leveling because you dont have to stealth and much and blade flurry makes it easy to kill an add if you get one. It's all around much easier for pve content.
---
Seeing what gear someone is wearing is important in classic to determine how strong they are in a PvP environment. In retail due to all gear being standardised you can just look at their hitpoints. Classic doesn't let you see health values.
---
Plus there isn't 4+ different types of the same gear just recoloured so you can an actual idea of how far people have progressed without everyone looking exactly the same. Though granted that won't really kick in until harder raids come out.
---
Only guy willing to pay for it out of the core raiders. It's not used in raids.
---
Rattlegore was balanced. I feel is more 35 65 now. We take our licks as ally, but there's a solid core of good pvp going. That said too many alliance run off.
---
There's no nameplates in this screenshot. Frames are LunaUnitFrames (not on curse so you have to download them manually) and Dominos for bars.
---
just go sm ruin im telling ya
---
only slightly worse than ds ruin yet you're still very capable in all other content, dungeons, farming mobs, PvP, you can even solo DM east if you're geared enough (...in the future)
---
sm ruin is king for every fresh level 60 warlock
---
If you have even one pocket healer in wpvp, (a smart one not like this guy having shit positioning and being punished for it) a warrior can be the most dangerous person in the battle no matter what the size. They can constantly dispel any roots or slows, spam u with heals against at least 5 attackers, and buff you. If you dont see how that makes you an unstoppable force then neither I or anyone else can help you. You're wearing plate armor ffs stop having smaller balls than gnome mage
---
I’m more surprised seeing a hunter without rok and lok.
---
I’d be irl dead if I did this. Dead in game dead in life. Lul. Jk but not jk?
---
Oh I had seen health bars for your character like that thought it would’ve been the same
---
I think you'd make a lot of hunters mad if you were deleting the blue sinew. Raids currently max out on black sinews and leafs quickly as you're only running 3 to 5 hunters max and they've got a pretty high drop chance.
---
? i didnt said that lol....
---
He's true to his guild names cause that's a Yikes from me lol
---
I was really enjoying it but since phase 2 i haven't really played. I was getting bored whilst trying to lvl being killed constantly by 60's but i think it's mainly my fault for not sticking to one character and getting it to 60.
---
But also has a longer cast time. Shadowbolt is still more dps
---
Most people don't really worry about it because it's not as if 1% hit makes or breaks a dungeon fight, but I'd just stick with 5 or 6%
---
You don't need crazy amount of consumables to clear all content. I just used the basic elixir of mongoose + squid in retail and I cleared naxx and I plan to do the same. 
---
The main difference is now is the immense min-max knowledge so there will be players pushing it past what 99.99% of players did back then, and I won't be one of those since it's really not needed.
---
I swear to god I remember it being a thing back in vanilla and tbc that you missed like CRAZY if you met people even remotely higher level than you (and especially skulls) but when watching old PvP videos from Happyminti and his first movie, Nerf Sap, you can see him pvping as 51-52 and killing 60's and it seems like the only things missing are his offhand hits (auto attacks, and I just assume those are his offhand since dw'ing gives less hit rating and all that jazz)
---
BUT, it's QUITE the difference of hitting a skull and someone "just" 8-9 levels above you.
---
And as said, I SWEAR on my mothers grave that you wouldn't be able to do this back in vanilla, but it could definitely be my minds playing tricks on me at this point.
---
&gt;but at that rate wouldnt they just keep adding expansions until we catch up to retail?
---
if I can get 5 years of content that I KNOW will be good then its a no brainer for me, rather than to risk new content which blizzard hasn't really been good at producing the last few years. 
---
Besides, TBC makes 1000x more sense for blizzard, basically 0 development costs and guaranteed success vs classic+ which is a huge risk with very questionable future.
---
Based.
---
So fucking sick of boomers bragging about clearing trivial content 3 months after launch.
---
no, it really isnt.
---
Watch it - boomer in the vicinity.
---
There's a pretty large number of people who rate TBC as one, if not the best iteration of WoW. 
---
There's also the understanding that something needs to happen. You can't just endlessly farm Naxx until the population fades out into nothing. Which is why classic+ or TBC are expected to follow at some point.
---
My first BRD run was 3 warriors a rogue and a healer. We wiped on the first boss as someone got feared oe some how pulled a group of mobs. Then healer died again to a big group of random mobs as the 2 other warriors kept pulling, healer then left, then the 2 other warriors left. I haven't been back to BRD since.
---
In a time where MC is easily clear able with 5-6 level 55s and the raid still isn't at 40 members, yeah there's no problem with whatever spec someone wants to play at this point. People saying there is are just parroting the internet memes. Maybe it'll change in BWL we'll see.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah, number 4. was true .. :D
---
Atleast I didn't fuck something up so that's a win.
---
Fair enough. Net cafe I went to wouldn't ever put foreign USBs into their PCs.
---
I guess this gives me incentive to kill grays now.
---
In guessing you don’t know how to “use em”
---
All of your points were really useful, thank you.
---
Lol, it’s like 7 allies v 1 horde on my server
---
That addon helped me a lot, thanks.
---
They're both dildos
---
People in my previous guild claimed the fight was bugged because their threat meters were unreliable on Ony...
---
Alliance just needs to quit whining and fight back. There is nothing preventing you from forming a 5 man to fight their 5 man or x vs x. I have flown over burning steppes many times and seen massive world pvp. Its amazing. Join the action rather than bitch about it.
---
Well, I wouldn’t say you can’t find it anywhere, surely there are some tex-mex places here and there I guess, but it’s not popular and places like that are also very scarcely seen. 
---
Also, Tthank you very much, I really enjoyed it and I think I’ll be making it again in the future!
---
Check one of my posts, I had many answers to this question there
---
How much have you spent on the twink OP?
---
I'll be [waiting](https://imgur.com/ho4dECz) for you.
---
Stormstrike gives you an extra chance to trigger windfury, right after your first auto attack. Instantly wrecking   
---
half of a cloth-wearing players health pool in PvP is like cocaine to me, I'll never swap to another spec. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I like nightfalls quest guide too it’s got great recommendations
---
I think this is the problem. Their desperation makes them agree to something they're not ok with, and then they get mad if things go wrong.
---
Some friends and I just transferred there haha. Whitemane is pretty unplayable so some of them wanted to quit all together. We decided to give Anathema a shot instead but we're 5 rl friends with 2 others already there with tanks and healers. So we'll see
---
Generally affliction with wanding after dots until around late 30s/40 then respec to drain tank is the most efficient.
---
The escape.
---
Yes but how does that get them from 0 aggro on ony to above a warlock in 2 seconds?
---
Dude, 'LOL' is in the dictionary, 'Literally' is in the dictionary and has one of the definitions below it the same as 'Figuratively'. Its literally all about usage of the word in normal language. Get over it weirdo, zeep zorp
---
Guildies where going UBRS over and over to get a trinket for a mage friend of theirs. A warrior got locked out trying to fish for Jed as he forgot a run earlier. Long story short he was there for MH but it never drops, I myself did not need it anymore as i got brut blade a while back.  
---
Long story short we forgot he was chilling outside and slaughtered Rend. It did drop and everyone went quiet.. We all said nothing important dropped before he left.  
---
I think we did the right thing acting like that.. Poor fuck :P
---
Would someone please think of the children!
---
Nothing has changed, including your strawman.
---
You are still wrong about mace specialization, though.
---
I like the Wow theme. I think Blizzard did a great job with the WoW UI and love how it looks
---
Dude, stop playing on a PvP server then. That's precisely why world PvP sucks, it's 100% unfair except the rare cases when you spot one other person at full health, and both indirectly agree to a fair duel, and no one else comes along to wreck you or the other part.
---
The only world PvP I can find fun is the old school Tarren Mill / Southshore back-and-forth chaos in huge swarms of people. But PvP and PvE just doesn't mix, that's why it sucks getting engaged while you're busy PvE'ing. And as you say, corpse camping straight up prevents you from being able to play.
---
I will never play on a PvP server; give me my peace and quiet that PvE offers.
---
That’s not what anyone is suggesting. If you don’t want jed don’t find jed. However, don’t advertise it if you don’t have it. I expect to show up to an id with jed... not spending 15 mins looking for him. If you advertise jed runs you need to have the id first.
---
Except it is.
---
Weird way to frame it. Tank pulled wrong. No big deal. Dps offers advice based on previous experience and gets told to shut it because he's "not raid geared". Dps guy then shows the tank that he's not even geared enough to hold aggro ironically. It's not like the dps caused a wipe to get back at him lmao. I would do the same thing. I'm not even sure if we read the same comment.
---
Just level sm/ruin
---
My guild brings 1 meme spec of each class so gear isn't wasted but it's starting to piss me off especially when I'm asked to spec into one of these meme specs so this post touches a nerve. You wouldn't let people raid in PvP spec so why let them raid in shitty dps spec.
---
You sound salty
---
I got it from the source that the Dwarf Priest was the ***Chosen One***
---
You wanted Classic. You got Classic. Dont ask for retail.
---
I agree, world PvP was more enjoyable before honor, now it's just a shit show and will stay that way until BG's. Anyways honor or not I wouldn't waste my breath on someone 25 lvls below me who just used all their cooldowns.
---
They were around at the end of vanilla. There is no reason to believe that they won’t be made available in classic. It will probably be a little while though.
---
Can't meters just sync with other clients in the background like they used to for threat meters?
---
To my rogue bros out there
---
Am I crazy or is bonescraper better than distracting dagger for pvp
---
I've been wanting to do a 30/0/21 build for a while, but I'm worried that I lack the +sp damage gear, since I really don't have much of anything in terms of +spell damage.
---
As much as I absolutely love hotw/ns, I'm just not running dungeons anymore I find, it's all about that pvp grind (want my 3 piece bonus in a big way), so I find a lot of my talents in feral are wasted and I'm really just going down to get that sweet sweet hotw 5point.
---
How much +spell damage gear do you have and do you find it works well without +spell damage gear?
---
You mean wotlk. In tbc most classes/specs absolutely had unique abilities and were somewhat viable for some thing. In wotlk many of the previously unique traits were spread to other classes.
---
&gt; not very good = there are better
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding but it seems like you are literally saying "this weapon is not good for the sole reason that there a few weapons better than it"
---
Dungeons. All day.
---
Do you have your tidal charm yet
---
that's how I did it as a human, just set my hearth to feathermoon and ride trhere get 1 hide, hearth or ride back. It wasn't too bad
---
ah thank you, i might try that :) sounds like a good idea!
---
My battle chicken is useless. In both PvP and PvE, the targeting is very shoddy. Plus 90% of the time he spawns in and just doesn’t move.
---
If you think being killed and corpse camped after landing at a FP is PvP then you dumb af
---
He probably is specced into the talent that allows arcane missiles to not suffer pushback.

bats in eastern had great loot tables on private servers (not sure about classic) Around 04:30 in this video: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh3fUKhN91Q
---
they're pretty spread out so you can try and find an excluded area. Grinded em from level 55-60 (and did dungeons) and dinged 60 with like 500g
---
Hahaha, I actually do, and I even have a designated cup that’s exactly “one cup” big and use that for measurements! So that’s a bit easier to do than ounces or pounds or gallons...
---
Got sinew but no leaf, Eye dropped tonight for the 4th time in a row... This upsets me a little tbh.
---
This is why I don’t use my locks outs to look for Jed, if the casters and healers need it they can go look
---
Mace spec is garbage, Sword is not and BRE is super good
---
Any 3 level 60s do it easily.
---
Way higher IQ to reuse your resources and make a lot of money than gamble creating an entire new game. You’re the one who’s apparently not that smart.
---
Fair enough.  Then I will agree BRE is better for raids.
---
3 or 4
---
I am at 55 turnins to go for the winterspring saber mount, it has been one hell of a journey but I've met some great people along the way!
---
yea that's a good point. basically if you are pretty freshly/low geared it's not that great. And certainly even less great outside of a group/raid.
---
As long as we do the same for pve servers where allies are 70/30.
---
The unfair advantage is coordination?
---
&gt; The dungeons however is a massive downgrade
---
You're nuts. Every dungeon had multiple bosses with actual mechanics. Classic dungeons are sometimes somewhat non-linear, and if figuring out which direction to point your toon in really gets you excited then you do you, but I'd rather have a more linear layout with bosses and trash that change the way you play.
---
&gt; Beyond that, you are stuck on Outland wth flying mounts, portals and summons everywhere doing daily quests.
---
TBC struck a great balance between keeping the world feeling real and making things reasonably convenient. And daily quests beat the shit out of open-ended mega-grinds like Classic Argent Dawn.
---
The best part is 3:10. The way you slink back into the bush is hilarious.
---
Basically what I started doing at like 45+ because I found it easier and more fun. A good group can net a ton of exp fast
---
43 frost mage, is it worth learning how to properly AoE grind by now, or just get to 60 playing regularly? I have imrpoved blizzard maxed out, but I could Respec if need be.
---
Nope this happened on skeram server, in badlands near the elementals
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/whitemane/bext
---
I’ve been playing 2h fury with OEB for over a month now. You can run thru my logs (they certainly aren’t perfect). 
---
BT &gt; WW &gt; Hamstring. Use HS or Cleave if above 65 rage, and you’ve got a second target or are safe on threat. HoJ is really fucking good so go farm that. So is SGC. You want 25% crit minimum for flurry uptime, optimally 30, softcapping at 35%. 
---
Black dragonscale set is incredible for 3pc, as there aren’t great shoulder/boot options out there, and the legs and chest let you alt SGC/Devilsaur set. Get your hands on some MC gear and 6% hit. Do you have your gear set posted anywhere?
---
For alliance it should go to a ret over warrior anyways.
---
So what are the positives about the game you like
---
I enjoyed a lot of 19 pvp on my orc shaman .
---
I already have add ons to show MY DoT's and stuff, I meant specifically for showing enemy HoT's, shield timers, sprint/evasion timer, etc. Does this do that too?
---
Dang. Must suck pvp happened on a pvp server.
---
For anyone with **Savage gladiator chain** how many runs did it take for it to drop?
---
Only like 10% of people get motion sickness from it
---
Probably not, but it's really impossible to tell in advance. It depends heavily on how bad the queues are.
---
I’m a lock too but I haven’t had this issue yet I don’t see why they’d have a bias unless they’re really uptight about their group comp
---
Correct. But it first started in late BC
---
It’s kind of a moot point, because if your goal is to get a guild’s hand of rag, then you’ll most likely already be in the raid as enhance with a nightfall/totem twisting build. A lot of guilds will have someone in this role, and when the eye drops that’s the likely person to get the item, not a healing shaman.
---
I see. Great insight. You're totally right.
---
Why so much hate against hunters in general? I've noticed this many places 😂
---
Same with pallys and holy power... murdered my favorite class... plate wearing rogue
---
A good raiding guild would expect you to have all your consumables and BiS gear to the point that you don't get a place in the raid without so how are you achieving this by avoiding any grind? If you are really in such a guild I don't see how it's even an option to use your gold on something that does not help the raid. If you are just in a standard raiding guild, as many people are, I would go with the mount and sell whatever you have for it.
---
Ok I take part of that back apparently the combination of classic aura durations and threat plates is what makes those icons work I disabled nugrunning and they remained. I disabled then classic aura durations and the timers disappeared and the icons remained on the name plates. Nug allowed you to put a full timer bar on the nameplate like the ones shown on the right in the one picture.
---
Thanks for this!
---
It procs enchants, other trinkets, and consumables.
---
The only reason I could see HoJ as an exception is because the extra hit from HoJ would also trigger SoR damage, so it would double dip. I have no idea though
---
&gt; Okay. I get it bro. You don’t like world pvp. You’ve made that very clear.
---
IDGAF if gankers and corpse campers get their fun taken away, no. Sorry if that upsets you.
---
&gt; Let me explain this to you. It’s called world pvp. The whole point of world pvp is that it can happen anywhere and at anytime. Not just in the super-safe carebear-designated pvp space.
---
It could still happen anywhere two people happened to be. My point was that *if* you wanted world PvP there were places you could go to be 100% guaranteed of getting it. Or if not you had an absolute primo farming spot all to yourself and you should be happy anyway.
---
&gt; A new definition???? It’s called WORLD pvp not “pvp in this one place where everyone gives consent”
---
No one said anything about consent. You are getting emotional and ranting at clouds.
---
&gt; You were so close to figuring it out then your brain just bdos’d for the rest of your comment
---
"It's not enough that I can have world PvP any time I want! I NEED to know that it might happen to someone else somewhere else over a herb node or something! That's the single most important thing in game design and trumps every other consideration! I'm HEALTHY!"
---
Don’t use slam. If you’re super advanced and build into it its technically good, but the risk-reward is bad. Just spam hamstring in your downtime, as long as you have WF or need a crit for flurry. You should see a massive dps boost with OEB if you have support crit for flurry over deep woods, and if you stay high on rage, having enough to BT and WW on cooldown. Its worth dumping rage for Overpower too, as long as you have time to swing for rage before the next BT. Know when to cleave, it’ll rocket you over 1k dps. Demand windfury totem or the spec is a lot worse. Pop reck on execute phase. 
---
Your spec there is fine, but I take 2/3 cleave for MC since I respec for raid dps only. The biggest mistake people make with this build is pressing too many buttons— if you rage starve yourself with stance dancing unnecessarily or HS/Cleave you will see large dps losses. Sometimes you gotta right click and take your hands off the keyboard. 
---
#1 thing is to let tanks get threat (sunder first global to help them) or you WILL get slapped by the boss.
---
I read what the poster above you said and we’re both playin it right :)
---
Is one of the ingredients just "1 teaspoon"?
---
min/max is fun
---
Stick to dungeons
---
There are so many people that it will be 5 min max.
---
Make your own groups
---
Why is your lady old
---
Sounds like a good time. I'd definitely be interested in joining a guild if you form one :)
---
Part of the ease is that it's patch 1.12. People remember earlier patches where it was tougher due to classes not having been balanced as well/gotten buffs and due to itemization being poorer. Some quests were added later too so some people talk about running out of quests a lot likely from those times. You also need to factor in back in 2004 a lot of people were really just kids who had no idea what they were doing, guides and the like did exist but a lot of people didn't read them or realize they were subpar. A lot of people didn't get addons and a lot of people didn't get consumes like they should have or itemize their characters correctly. Then alot of people had potato computers and internet and would lag on top of that.
---
Mechanics wise nothings been hard. With the leveling difficulty it's more just paying attention and having to group at times that sets it apart from retail.
---
You may be able to move the character to a new account if you can prove that it's a family xfer to blizz (idk if they'll do it but it's worth a ticket perhaps) but not to a new faction/server.

it's just insane, i cant even tell ppl oom, or afk 2 sec or brb drink, nothing. ended up leaving my group, now trying to go solo while getting ganked left, right and center

I was today years old when I read this comment and realized that I've been running to Duskwood for 3 months like a fool. Thank you!

On heartseeker we do this at org. It’s a lot of fun. We will push as far in as the bank sometimes if there is really not resistance. Ideally horde will chase us out to the zepp tower

I didn’t aoe grind for levelling but it’s worth learning as you’ll want to know how to farm gold efficiently at 60 anyway.
---
Not to concerned honestly the few times I’ve seen multiboxers ever they haven’t been that great and in the off chance there is one in a battle ground they have individual threats they need to respond to I doubt the opposing team will just see a clump of people and let them just Xv1 them

If you press need, nobody can steal the item.

Every time an epic BoE drops I tell everyone to roll need. I've never had someone ninja in my groups, because they can't.

Keep being a victim, pal.
---
And no, there shouldn't only be need or pass,  because green BoEs are going to greed 99% of the time for people at 60, but at lower levels greens will be legitimate upgrades. Do you understand how the rolling system works?

Getting gear easily makes it absolutly meaningless.

Just more DPS. We burn him in phase 1 every week.

Could change when split runs start though

If your guild is so well geared and organized you do 15-40 second boss kills, might as well keep BRE and spec arms for sweeping strikes then.

Thanks for the info! Yeah I’m probably going to try it in a couple of weeks when I have more free time, less games in my back log, and we’re past thanksgiving.

Any multiboxer who tries will just be on honor farm.

If you are running something 20 times and not calling something reserved, you only have yourself to blame.
---
if you think torturing a living animal is in any way similar to mildly inconveniencing someone in a video game, you need help.  maybe call your local politician to see if "gamer cruelty" can be added into law alongside "animal cruelty".
---
the mental gymnastics at play here are astounding.  imagine convincing yourself that someone pressing a button at you on a pvp server is indicative of psychopathic tendencies.  everyone gets ganked, everyone has ganked, most people don't work themselves up over it and have to fluff their ego like this.  camping lowbies for no reason is a pretty shit thing to do, yes, but comparing it to causing excruciating pain to a living creature is mind boggling.

imagine telling someone this in real life.  "oh yeah animal cruelty is bad, but i feel similarly when someone kills me in world of warcraft!"

Arcane crystals can be a little feast or famine but I just spend most my downtime running my route in EPL, got 4 in two hours the other day.
---
I'd expect to see a lot of reserves at this stage of the game - a lot of the people who are running dungeons will have every item they wanted, apart from one or two stubborn drops that they really don't want to miss out on again.
---
I haven't had time to watch the entire video lately but from the small chunks I see I've only seen him say that it is more about threat generation than damage mitigation. Give me some timestamps, otherwise I won't be able to see the video for a while
---
aww you're upset :( you were wrong and called out on it
---
This just isn’t that enjoyable to watch.

Old, new, as long as the game is good I’ll at least try it. I’ve been looking at a lot of stuff for classic so I’m definitely going to give it a try.

Thanks for the heads up. I’ll definitely skim through and see what’s been posted about the whole situation.

Exactly, Paladins are an extreme utility class that severely boosts the alliances up time.
---
For shamans specifically yes. By being able to perfectly land 5 chain lightnings in the same batch. You 100-0 someone in a single cast. Ungeared that's 2500 damage, but with elemental mastery it's 5k.
---
For someone who's naked without spellpower gear.

Lvl 50 alliance hunter. Trying to level is a pain lately. Besides taking a break until BGs to quest again. Is there any other questing zones besides searing gorge is better or should I go the dungeon route and do Mara until like 53 then sunken temple till 55 etc then what other dungeons after that?
---
I know there will biases since this is a subreddit dedicated to classic, but then who else would I ask (btw text does a poor job of conveying how things are said. I don’t mean this in a confrontational way, if there’s other places to look for info I’m all ears)?
---
They are frost and fire immune
---
Ohh so now reserving is ok.. this subreddit loses their minds over reserved runs and now its ok.
---
Just do dire maul East jump runs with a friend or two but this only really works if you’ve got a miner and herbalist in your group. This is a great way to make money and just hanging out in discord with your group and maybe some extra friends makes this a pretty enjoyable task.
---
I never said anything about faction queues. That would be a reason not to play the over populated side was suggesting a reason to play the underdog side.

I dig it. I think it'd be funnier if you had something for their actual voices, but I think that'd be a lot harder than what is reasonable. 9/10

was in a group last week where they rushed forward always.  By the time I got to them, one or two died and they stormed a shammy position full of totems....

They told me to respec my priest.  I put them on ignore, dropped group and rerolled pally.

Omg

The aggregated data graphs show otherwise. There are overall marginally more alliance accounting all servers

Horn isn’t a big deal. You can summon him, tame him, abandon the quest and re-accept it to get a new one.

Update
---
My honor didnt update at all from Thursday. I still see wednesday honor as yeasterdays. However. My HKs did reset this morning. I am a bit worried.
---
I'll give that a shot, thanks
---
How do you mean aim it at someone?
---
Reread my post. I'm not saying it's broken and unfair.
---
I'm saying I'm surprised those people aren't brigading this post and complaining about PvP like they do every other thread.
---
And yet looking at all the replies from Horde on Heartseeker since I gave my opinion, it looks like my opinion was correct. 
---
So please tell me, what the fuck was even the point of your reply??
---
We have to have hope in something, cause it ain't making it to BRM in less than an hour
---
So much this!
---
I've done about 200 runs at this point with my duo partner, let's break it down
---
Did a set of 5 runs last night with each run being 10 minutes each but due to the lockout lets say it took an hour. 
---
-2 arcane crystals (45g each)
---
-2 essence of water (15g each) 
---
-stack and a bit of dreamfoil (12g) 
---
-some thorium not sure how much my duo partner keeps it
---
-4(per run)*5(runs) item drops of about 2g each (40g)
---
That's 172g total before factoring in things like forors drops (had 3), turning herbs into potions, extra drops like sapphires, felcloth or even extra boss drops. Even if you're super unlucky and get no crystals or essences it's still like 30-40g an hour each
---
Where people mess up is taking 3 people when you can easily do with two (sham/Warr or pally/Warr)
---
What is spell batching?
---
I enjoy killing these people in the open world/duels while they sit wondering why their arcanite reaper and half BiS didn't give them an auto-win. Anyone can read wowhead and spam dungeons/farm for hours to get geared, but still not know how to use 3/4 of their abilities at the correct time, esp. in PvP. Not to say getting geared isn't important, but it makes the most difference when you learn how to actually play on the way...and makes very little difference if you just suck and think you are "elite" because you ran a lot of instances and pressed 3 buttons.
---
Heavily decreased the range on it to around 50 yards. Previously it was around 200 yards or something, the thing would beep before they even rendered in for me.

---
Idk man, I think telling someone whose creative to stop being creative for their niche is just sad, but to each their own I guess
---
It's a mixed bag. I'd say expect to run a lot. You're dealing with a 1 in 6 chance of even seeing the boss in a run along with a 7% drop rate. I know some people who got it in a couple runs, but for comparsion when I was trying to get ban'thok sash for my mage (39% drop rate) I ran arena probably close to 100 times, saw the boss that drops it 6-7 times, and only saw it drop once. On the other hand, I ran with people who said they had seen it drop 3 times in a row before I joined the group, or that they got it in their first few runs. I saw glad chain drop before I saw sash drop.
---
Yes, and he wants to do dungeons. Hardly off topic. You created a clear dichotomy and I disagreed with it. That is very on topic. I disagreed with you, that isn't blustering. You are the one blustering. You previous posts are the testament to it. You're imposing these imaginary emotions on me to bolster your ego it sounds like. You're confusing someone disagreeing with you and someone yelling at you.
---
Tanks are chosen for their damage mitigation but their primary focus lies with threat generation. Where am I wrong here?
---
Glad I could give you some insight ! I haven't had that much fun in a game for as long as I can remember.  I am 28 years old and it brought me right back to childhood.  I honestly thought I was done with gaming but nope.  Games are just not that good anymore (or at least doesn't hit the spot for me) but I have 23 days played since release.  That's a 8h/day average with a full time job, dating and trying to see friend.  Sleep is optional at this point

He didn't say what you "quoted," he said he doesn't want to reroll after having spent so long leveling his main. Don't misconstrue his words and then criticize those misconstrued words.

You had us in the first half not gonna lie

What server are you on with a Shaman multiboxer?  I think I know the guy you’re talking about.

That one and this one https://youtu.be/q3xUO7LZUTU
---
Holy lol
---
Black Baron Cape is literally the only non-raid item I need and I’m willing to roll for it but I haven’t had any luck in even finding a group for the past 2 weeks.
---
Eventually I might just give in and become part of the problem. Get my guild to do the dungeon with me and put everything on res so only people who are still leveling will join...
---
Okay that was funny. you have my Upvote.
---
Thank you for being actually mindful on how to get around these things. If we had more Allies like you, the horde would definitely bitch more haha. I'd still kill you on aight as a horde player, but you're doing the right stuff
---
It was nice until you killed that female tauren, that's too much man
---
Animals being able to parry attacks
---
I can land LB and CL for 1300 damage without crits every 6 seconds at range. If I size up my ranging right, I can land another 600 damage shock. All in the same batch. With elemental mastery I can guarentee at least two of those crit, but with good timing I can possibly get all three to crit guarenteed. Ele shaman has like 90% of Enh burst but reliably and at range. The range thing is huge with shaman's lack of mobility.
---
I get all the fun of things exploding, but without a lot of the downsides Enh shaman has.
---
One of the most annoying things in classic. I'm not sure why so many people expect you to know the dungeons in and out, it's a 10+ year old game... 
---
Second biggest issue for me as a tank is when people are backseat tanking. "You need to mark all the mobs!" "Wait for me to get mana!" "Don't you have better tanking gear?" It doesn't matter if you do a quick run without any wipes, someone always finds an issue. A lot of those things like marking and waiting for healers to have mana are important but you can do most dungeons without doing any of this if you have a competent group.
---
Only there cuz BRM is too saturated
---
To me, this is why hunters should be pulling.

Idiot comment here. You have no idea whether he was one of the #nochange crowd. This guy is frustrated about something legitimate and provides a viable solution to the problem that would make blizzard even more money.

"No need to spam the post with your anecdote, we already have it fully 'confirmed' through anecdotes elsewhere."

Aaaaaahahahahaha
---
Classic will be dead in a month they said...
---
What server?  If you’re Kromcrush I’ll run you through
---
You can do mara (at least purple/orange to get the sceptre) from about 48, you can do ST from as early as 50, and from about 52 you can start doing BRD prison runs. You won't be doing outstanding DPS at those levels, but you should be able to hold your own except for the last bosses of each. I think DM E is about to the same level as the start of BRD.
---
I tanked each of them at those levels, I was even doing mara princess at 48 (with a degree of difficulty).
---
If you haven't started your Ony attunement yet then maybe get start looking into it, alliance can pick it up from 48.
---
From 55 you should be finishing Ony attune, doing MC attune, getting deeper into BRD (emperor), other wings of DM. LBRS/UBRS.
---
This^  besides a tank, everything else fills up quickly. You dont even have to lead it. Just make it dude. Ppl will join it
---
I play on Pyrewood Village, definitely recommend it!
---
Does it work with Shadowed Unit Frames?
---
&gt;has changed Asmongold from having a charming winner mentality to a crybaby
---
Was that post satire?
---
Be the change that you want to see in the world
---
Yep, that was my thinking that each door is something that anyone can buy (if they meet the requirements). The game is way too huge for people to be able to "claim" a door only for themselves. But even if 100 people live at the same "address", considering the VAST amount of these doors that exist in the world, that still makes it much more varied and personalized than say garrisons, where everyone literally has the same one in the same location (well except horde and alliance). 
---
I do like the idea of the house providing some benefit to rest buff for sure! And additional storage as well of course.
---
I like you, you're my kind of people. Sadly I don't know the show well enough for a proper secondary quote reply.
---
Yeah pretty much . The points on pet health/mana can be jumbled round, and I prefer 4 in suppression
---
Ah nah I’m on Skeram.  But yeah, in any case, /follow will be disabled in BGs so I don’t think you can multibox in them without using (bannable) complicated broadcasting of keystrokes and mouse movements.
---
Enhancement is a pretty great leveling spec up until around 40. After that, your damage doesn't keep up with increasing enemy health pools as much and you start having to use more active abilities, draining your mana faster, making it so you have to drink more. For that reason, and because elemental becomes much better after 40 thanks to some good late talents, a lot of people (maybe even most people) do enh up to 40 and swap to ele for the rest of the leveling process.
---
That does sound very cool!
---
And then no casters. Have fun waiting
---
Go warrior. Big dps wity windfury and you guys can fill up dungeon groups quickly since you can tank and your buddy can heal.
---
Both sides though lol.
---
ur missing the point, i shouldn't have to make a full new character in a dead server to help keep the server alive. this server needs to be merged with another low pop server to make 1 server. should NOT have to be the one to make a new character when there is a faster and easier solution, either merge servers or allow transfers, simple solutions that will keep the game alive
---
He is Undead. Half of his brain is rotten, so you could imagine his mental state :)
---
You’re almost geared enough to be 16th in damage! Follow your dreams.
---
That kick you highlighted, it was on cooldown and by the time it went off the castbar was already at 95%.
---
I make this every once in a while that chili recipe is so good!
---
Yesterday did a strat UD. You know how easy it is to get adds in that dungeon, and with the two warriors being inexperienced (one was 59), we wiped 2 or 3 times due to asspulls. Suddenly the shaman healer proposes to kick the L59 "it's the only way he'll learn". We all disagree and he continues to berate the L59. Tank leaves. I tell the healer that I hope he's happy with where his attitude brought us. He retorts that people should know the dungeon. I go "what and you spawned L60 and perfect or sth"! In his opinion I should leave to which I demonstratively did. Found a nice new group soon after that (which also wiped twice, despite being clearly very experienced). We just don't need that in our game. It's not a job and wipes are part of the learning process, NOT getting kicked because of a wipe.
---
Oh my mistake, and no from what I understand that isn't possible, kind of. An add-on may be able to do it if the cast of the spell is detected in the combat log, though I don't know if one exists, but you cannot target a random thing and see buffs on it, this was not a thing in vanilla and was added later on. The exception to this being if you use detect magic.
---
Not true, if you are in IF putting together group, then why would I expect you to have a Jed ID. if its jed run do your part and fish, dont be lazy entitled player.
---
in my complaints i hope for a resolve im not asking more people to join this server im asking for a way out of hell. for all of us.
---
Just because you don't know the meaning doesn't mean it isn't so.
---
Gotcha. So I could probably search for Mara and ST. Then start doing BRD at 52. Do you have any suggestions on grinding spots while I search for the dungeons?
---
please reread what i had said, for i should not have to make a full new character in a dead server
---
I already have bone reavers edge but thanks
---
Upvoted for that last line
---
Oh, so level 60 Hordes bodycamping in Redridge because someone killed their alt in Hillsbrad?  
---
That explain everything!
---
Jesus Christ imagine wasting 40 minutes of your life just to annoy some random dude you don't even know
---
Also have to remember that vids like this and Nerf Sap are highlights, we dont get to see the rest of the content thats atleast 10 times the length of this where it all fails.
---
Download questie. Go where the quests are.
---
I wish that were the case. A lvl 20 something paladin hit HoJ on me. Didn’t resist any of a 45 mages frost bolts either.
---
Damn. Thank you for your input
---
So annoying.... and now even worse with Phase 2 atleast in my server, had opposing faction camping the dwarf by chillwind where you get the disguise and the gate at the end of the escort quest. 3-4 hours of my life I wish I could get back
---
Hordes will whine and say that alliance does this too lol
---
Probably depended on the server.  There absolutely were coalitions and cross faction agreements on US Warsong back then, as well as your standard over the top criteria to join a simple dungeon run.
---
Who needs to make excuses for something that’s not going to happen. Alliance suck at pvp, always have. It’s why so many are crying right now.
---
Considering the +6 to daggers is almost minimal in PvP, it's not that crazy.
---
There's also nethergarde keep, that's where I started but moved to mirage raceway when I discovered my old guild was there. Both seem good.
---
&gt;Scholomance. Just a few corpse runs if even that.  
---
Fly to Hinterlands, take hidden mountain road north to Scholomance - max one corps run at the gates.
---
So many ppl that ony buff took about 10 minutes to apear how lagged whole OG was.
---
Still enough to warn about this trick though
---
If u think guilds are gonna spend 200g for a flask when the raid can easily be completed without one, ur goddamn crazy lmao
---
Welp, time to start killing level 36s
---
??? This quest is so easy. Once he gets to the tower, you’re done. If you die you just lay there dead until his dad shows up and finishes it. Quest completes while dead. Then release and run back, res and instantly choose your reward. 
---
All this info is described on wowhead.
---
I... I need this
---
I would rather exist in a time when we travel the stars
---
I made a ticket asking when transfers would be available as im moving back to Aus soon and want to move my character to the oceanic servers, I was told that transfers won't be available for at least a year :(
---
To do checklist
---
This video is dated several days _before_ phase 2.
---
1.5 an hour seems really low for Felwood. I got 11 in an hour and a half a few weeks ago. Didn't keep track of how many I killed, it was a lot. But I could kill them in 3-4 frostbolts, so it went quick.
---
&gt;IDGAF if gankers and corpse campers get their fun taken away
---
Nice strawman, I never said anything about corpse camping, but yeah. It’s a part of the game. Go roll on a pve server. 
---
I mean it’s obvious you don’t get it you don’t need to keep fuming. 
---
&gt;*if* you wanted world pvp there were places you could go to be 100% guaranteed of getting it
---
You keep saying this, and it explicitly proves my point. World pvp isn’t about “let’s go to this place to fight” (that’s called a battleground). World pvp is about “anywhere, at anytime, there is potential for pvp”. 
---
&gt;no one said anything about consent 
---
If pvp only happens at specific places, being in that place means you have effectively given consent for pvp. 
---
&gt;I NEED to know that it might happen to someone else somewhere else over an herb or something
---
More evidence you don’t understand the underlying point, with a strawman to boot. 
---
It’s about being able to go out to herb and encountering fights on the way. Going to a certain area to farm mats for raid buffs, potentially encountering fights. It’s about making all the resources a potential battleground, so that you’re always engaged. That’s the point of a pvp server. Not so that if you “want” to pvp, you have some place to go. It’s about being forced into pvp to progress. PvP server. If you don’t want that, that’s what a pve server is.
---
YOU MEAN HORDE?
---
This addon just shows incoming healing in the Blizzard unit/raid frames and nameplates.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames should support heal prediction: You have to install [LibHealComm-4.0](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libhealcomm-4-0) yourself because the library isn't included in it out of the box.
---
I killed over 20 without a drop, also lots of pvp there and others farming it
---
I could tell you a problem with Alliance.  
---
They are all very-very individual. After you assembled group to go to BRD/UBRS - everybody will fly by themselves. They knew that Horde is camping, but they anyway will fly there without waiting others.  
---
Half will fly to Thorium, half to BS.  
---
And everybody will die alone to roaming groups of 2-3 Hordes long before reaching BRM gates where full 5-man party are waiting.  
---
It's not about learning PvP, it's about cooperation)
---
There is quite litterally something stopping me from finding 5 man. They aren't there, and even if, you still wont beat the 10-20 hordes
---
This always annoyed me.
---
People only learn their rotation abilities but not the full play of their class.
---
This is why I always held the belief that most pvp players were better at pave than strictly pve players in pvp. Obviously there’s some overlap, but generally speaking, pvp players knew their stuns, interrupts and how to react in different situations while strictly pve players that tunnel just know focus on most damage output.
---
I'm just peachy over here. Thanks for asking.
---
After months of stalling and not even being subbed at times, I'm just going to go ahead and start leveling characters. At least that way, I still don't know which class I want, but I can level some and get a better sense of what I do or don't want. And hey the ones I don't want can be low level battleground characters.
---
All too often, especially with brand new content, I see people that look to make groups, and they *only* want people that can practically do the instance/raid blindfolded, even if it’s only been out a couple of days. If you’re new or try to get through content, all too often you’re SOL, especially if you’re not in a huge guild. 
---
I have an extremely small guild (two people total), and getting into instances is almost impossible for me. I have to wait two expansions just to do raids (I can finally do WOD raids now) because I have to solo them.
---
Can you share gear for rogue?
---
just like when they first set up first come first server i guess, otherwise yea i guess that would be a problem.
---
Well you triggered me at least. I gave up on that a week ago.
---
Broadcasting of keystrokes can't be bannable, that's how multiboxing works for spellcasting/ability use.
---
I just dislike the advantage it brings for money. He's doing things in PvP I couldn't do as a solo player, and his 5 accounts rank very highly on the PvP charts because of it. Also doesn't give the alliance facing him a very fair shake.
---
Thank you!  Even if you watch the guides they don't always cover certain trash pulls or current boss tactics.  People just expect you to know this kind of stuff via osmosis or something.    
---
Hopefully you find a good guild with friendly people who are willing to work with you so that everyone benefits.
---
I feel like Heartseeker horde is slowly turning to 90% rogues lol. Though wpvp is mostly alliance roaming and a few horde gabksquads, there seems to be rogue pairs everywhere
---
There’s always 2-3 on the docks of menethil/theramore, between TP and BRM etc
---
Of note, there is plenty of alliance that got comfortable and afk in the open so plenty of targets and less horde competition on the tanking ladder
---
I slowly start to realize that every class is broken when you know what youre doing
---
Unfortunately only the cash shop mate. Hopefully blizz will implement it soon
---
MC is so such a struggle that there's not room for any deviation of "bis". Jesus

“i need to kill the rare for my &lt;insert non-warrior&gt; class quest.” “Okay, where is that? What is it called?” “How should I know? You’re the tank.” ...

**For people with Hand of Justice** how many runs did it take you to get it?
---
Don't worry as long as the tank doesn't die then it's the dps fault.

this only takes raiding logs from WCL into account but its good to use this to get an overview of the faction balance at level 60. most realms are horde dominated but there do still exist alliance-dominated realms, Heartseeker NA has a 80-20 alliance-favored population where the horde on that server are completely fucked.

I haven't played on Mirage Raceway personally. I'm not sure how Horde is in Pyrewood Village but I play Alliance there, it's really active and I've met lots of nice people here.
---
Death ray, shrink ray, and battle chicken are all bop though. If you're only learning one, then it's always best to be gnomish over goblin.
---
Does this also work with absorption shields such as Ice Barrier or PW:S? I'd kill for an addon that does that, i'm not sure if the API supports it or not
---
I did this, starting at lvl 57 or 58. You'll want to be sure to use the main entrance, and not the side entrance way to the east (the large treemen have huge overlapping agro radii). You'll want to stock up on greater mana pots -- for awhile every pull I would need to use the 3min free cast + crit cooldown, or a potion (sometimes both). Stocking up on mage water before you go is also good, so you can make good use of lucky pulls where you don't need to wait for your cds to come back up.
---
Do you have the alch elixir that gives +25 int? it helps a lot. Before I got max level holy nova, 6k mana felt like it still wasn't enough. I was in a healing spec tho, 26/25, and wasnt benefitting from the dps talents and cd at the bottom of the disc tree. I think those could really smooth things out (holy nova doesnt really benefit much from the sp i was getting from spirit).
---
The herbs were probably the most profitable part, tho the lashers do drop some nice greys and the occasional nice green/blue/purp jackpot. Take it slow, there's a lot of safe zones where you can wait for pats to pass, and you'll get the hang of it. Also the magic pillar of agro reset is useful if you can make it there in time! Letting you say, after clearing the lashers fear a big lasher next to an herb node, and make it out alive.
---
good luck!
---
Link please?
---
From experience, i'd always recommend going SM/Ruin first, especially in a PvP environment but also to give your party bloodpact while you gear up.
---
Leveling is fine, endgame not so much.
---
Enh suffers the fate of poor talent options for starters. But the big issue is it's a melee class (str/agi/stam) that needs to use mana (int) for its abilities which are very mana inefficient because they're incredibly bursty.
---
Soon as you run out of mana you're a bargain bin warrior with no active abilities anymore. And you run out very quickly. This makes them terrible in PvE where sustained damage is king, and they struggle with PvP in anything more than a dueling scenario.
---
The warlock had dots on him and was refreshing them when he gap closed.
---
Insane!
---
You've earned my upvote.
---
Implying
---
Are they too low level to receive the buff? There is a level restriction on who you can give it to.
---
You had me in the first half
---
It’s not an issue of liquidity. Just having more people overall doesn’t help, because the queue is proportional to the population.  Let’s assume that global faction balance is like 2:1. That means whenever you queue up, you’ll be at the end of a line that is roughly equal to the Alliance population, so you need to wait for all the games currently in progress to end, those alliance queue up again, they all go through another full game, and then you get your turn.
---
Killed them during 1 full stun duration that doesn't allow for counter play. That's a one-shot in my book.
---
I got extremely lucky. I decided to try the rogue solo farm technique (https://youtu.be/ojlo66XC5qg) and it took me about an hour and a half to get my first kill on him, just getting used to how to go about it. Also, each pack you have to clear, you have to use all your CDs, so that takes a lot of patience as well waiting for CDs to be back up but finally got him down and he dropped it on the first solo attempt. 
---
However, if he didn't drop it, I'm confident that once I got my first kill, I would have been able to reliably do it over and over again with probably like 20-25 minute runs. The whole thing was fun too, it's not like pickpocketing BRD. The only advice I'd give is don't get greedy, vanish if you're in trouble. I tried to get greedy a couple times and walking back to your corpse can make you feel burnt out, even tho you gotta wait on your cooldowns anyways, it's better to just Alt tab than run back to your corpse from Thorium Point. 
---
Anyways, if you decide to try it, good luck!
---
Lord please help this poor soul for he is lost. Greed overtook his very existence.
---
Those people absolutely exist and idk why they are even playing classic when retail and the mythic raiding scene was designed with them in mind.
---
Yeah. Keep telling people that until there are no alliance left and you have 6h bg queues and zero honor to farm in the open world. Enjoy.
---
Not a multi boxer, it's a guild of people
---
Got it on my 2nd kill 😊
---
Yeah, Paladin is one of the weakest (if not the weakest) 19 twinks, but not because "orcs have stun resist".
---
If you want to, sure. It definitely takes practice to get good at it. You may find you don't like it either. I don't, really. It's somewhat stressful for me as I'm not very good at determining max melee range, and even when I do it right it's kind of boring. Efficient, yes, fun, no.
---
Spy has been gutted now, have fun!
---
I've always been picked up by whatever guild notices I'm not in a guild and invites me and just roll with them
---
Here's my rough guide (alliance POV). I'm assuming you are using pretty basic, old school tactics, no cheesing with resto-pots and ignoring boss mechanics through consumables.
---
Lucifron - needs decursing and dispel magic by all capable classes.
---
* MT &lt;- 2 healers
---
* OT1 &lt;-1 healer
---
* OT2 &lt;- 1 healer
---
Magmadar - AOE fear, have priests spam fear ward on trash before
---
* MT &lt;- 2 healers (pref. dwarf priest)
---
Gehennas - reduced healing curse, druids will be decursing
---
* MT &lt;- 2 healers (non-druids)
---
* OT1 &lt;- 1 healer (non-druid)
---
* OT2 &lt;- 1 healer (non-druid)
---
Garr - paladins are nice to have with your offtanks, since they can cast blessing of freedom or dispel the slowing debuff - assign 1 healer to each off-tank
---
* OT1-4 &lt;- 1 healer each
---
Geddon - paladins and priests dispel (only mana users need dispelling)
---
* MT &lt;- 2 healers (druids)
---
Shazzrah - his amplify magic buff needs to be purged by a priest, druids should decurse - raid damage here is minimal, assignments not really necessary
---
Sulfuron - dispel magic needed here, boss doesn't hit very hard
---
* MT &lt;- 1 or 2 healers
---
Golemagg - Main tank/OT wil taunt off each other if debuff stack gets too high, so healers will need to switch targets, not a lot of raid damage so basically all healers are free to heal MT
---
* MT/OT
---
* Dog tank 1 &lt;- 1 healer
---
* Dog tank 2 &lt;- 1 healer
---
Majordomo - he doesn't hit very hard so 1 healer is enough
---
* MT &lt;- 1 healer
---
Ragnaros - hits hard, MT healers must be on the ball with precasting - reactive healing here will get your MT killed - other healers should be spread out evenly among DPS
---
* MT &lt;- 4 healers (must be spread out from each other, if they all get smashed by a fireball your tank will die)
---
This is not true at all, you can just check the numbers when he kills me. I got 4k hp without stam buffs and have been 60 since mid-september, nothing about being glasscannon because I just hit 60.
---
So I actually multibox 4 shamans and a war.  There ARE ways of multi boxing that are bannable (basically anything that’s not 1-to-1) and I don’t think there’s a way around those techniques in BGs.  You might be able to make it work until someone fears you, but good luck getting lined back up with legit broadcasting.  Tremor totem doesn’t really help with that, even.
---
Bind skull to a key and mark your targets. Dps is gonna do whatever they feel like most the time and make your life hell. 
---
Mark shit so they focus one target. Meanwhile just keep tab/mauling each mob and put faerie fire up on everyone. Spam swipe when you have the rage..
---
Only so much you can do when dps just starts blasting. Communicate with them and help them by marking a focus target
---
Save bash/taunt for mobs you lose threat on.  Feral charge also roots for a couple secs. If you can’t keep threat atleast do your best to stun/slow mobs
---
i think at that point a name is the last thing to worry about when a name doesn't justify as u play, if ur playing for ur name go to a role playing server
---
Ah that stinks, but thanks for the very timely response! I tried to comment on the CurseForge page for LibHealComm asking if this could be added, but I get "parsererror" every time I submit the reply :(
---
I just tested it, and it works for me. LibHealComm needs to be placed in your Addon folder, and, for configuration in SUF, you go to the unit frame you want to enable it for and then under Bars you find Incoming heals. But it should be enabled by default, at least it was for me.
---
Boooohoooo you have it so bad, you have too many horde players... Blizzard please fix game litterally unplayable for the horde! :&lt; how terrible!
---
Started using DHK because dumb dumbs kept assuming I meant Death Knight for some reason.
---
So for a large pull in dungeons I do this:
---
0. Mark up targets.
---
1. Cast regrown.
---
2. Cast rejuv.
---
3. Bear/enrage.
---
4. Either charge or pull with FF if I want to bring them back/LoS
---
5. At this point you’ll have about 50 rage gear/talent depending.
---
6. Demo roar.
---
7. Maul skull then immediately swipe. 
---
8. Tab swipe until rage bar is low. This is important as swipe only hits 3 targets, so by cycling through you’ll get them all.
---
9. Focus skull, as things die you’ll get less rage so swipe becomes less of a good idea.
---
0. As enemy numbers drop and your rage generation slows down don’t be afraid to power shift, just make sure the GCD isn’t active when you do. Also don’t do it on low health.
---
All of that combined with thorns will make it a lot easier to hold aggro. Basically if you’re losing it doing a pull like that (and to be clear most of that is NOT needed for most pulls) then your DPS is beyond fucking useless. 
---
The big one a lot of people miss as a bear tank is HoTing yourself up before the pull, not only does it take a little pressure off the healer but you get aggro for the heals as they tick, which all helps.
---
A lot of tanks will also mostly focus on skull for threat, but honestly I prefer to make sure the rest are on me instead. Getting skull back is only one taunt away, getting 4 others back is a pain in the arse or burning a 10 min CD.
---
speak with your internet provider, something is wrong
---
Amazing bro, you got a twitch pr YouTube i can sub to?
---
What am I looking at?
---
&gt; Nice strawman, I never said anything about corpse camping,
---
I never said anything about not liking world PvP, but here we are. Funny how strawmen are fine when you do them but you get all upset when I respond to a straw man with a straw man.
---
&gt; You keep saying this, and it explicitly proves my point. World pvp isn’t about “let’s go to this place to fight” (that’s called a battleground). World pvp is about “anywhere, at anytime, there is potential for pvp”.
---
According to you, one rando on the internet. This is just you making up a new version of "frooply" and saying "TBC made world PvP not frooply any more so it's all ruined".
---
There were tons of uncontested zones in vanilla plus instances, it's not like it is in any way new that some places are "safe spaces" from PvP. Nor is it even true that you were safe in TBC if someone wanted to roll up on you while you herbed or mined. You are acting like 60% speed flying mounts were magical PvP immunity.
---
&gt; If pvp only happens at specific places, being in that place means you have effectively given consent for pvp.
---
You seem awfully offended by the idea that people might have to give consent to things. You're not one of those incels by any chance are you?
---
&gt; It’s about making all the resources a potential battleground, so that you’re always engaged. That’s the point of a pvp server. 
---
Yeah, I called it. "Waah it's not enough that I have PvP on tap absolutely whenever I want it, I *need* to feel like people who aren't me are having PvP somewhere else when they don't want it!".
---
Who cares? Why are you so emotional over what you think people who aren't you are doing where you can't see?
---
I mean, ignoring for a fact that everything you are saying is stupid because anywhere you want to farm mats or raid buffs someone can go and PvP with you, *even if* your wrong claims were right why do you care?
---
You lose to much for the grasp. This best pve and pvp rejuvenation is only 111 more healing vs 6 percent reduced mana on healing touch which is your nature swiftness spell. Feline swiftness is a complete waste bc if your going fast you should be in travel form cat form is 600ish mana to transform into vs travel which is 100ish . This also will allow you to deal with all content in pve also.
---
That's racist
---
Smells like bigfoots dick !
---
Nice try trying to explain away persistent anti social activities that only exist to bring others pain and yourself pleasure. Is it at the same scale?  No.  Is it as self absorbed and indulgent?   Yes.
---
Generally true but as a level 30 alliance on a horde dominated server, I ran into assholes a lot thr first week of pvp!
---
a bunch of horde with no alliance to kill
---
The only thing that sucks about twinking is not enough character space. I want to make (almost) every class a twink and for each bracket.
---
I got mine in about 20/25? But I think that when you account for the boss spawning and the 7% drop rate, you have about a 1% chance of it dropping per arena run.
---
Hi, /u/Angus950

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e163h9/what_is_the_average_played_to_reach_lvl_60_as_a/). 
---
While population problems did exist, you also have to factor in the huge queues. 4-6 hour queues by the time Blizzard opened transfers, Horde on these servers were probably sitting prettier and were less incentivized to transfer, thinking that “other people will transfer and queues will drop”
---
I xferred to Heartseeker on day 3 when I returned to work and couldn’t login early to avoid the que. Tired of seeing people that lowered your que referred to as “fleeing”.  “OG” Players that rolled on Stalagg fled Herod technically
---
Why is this zone so empty?  And is it normal that I can’t find any quests here?
---
The opinions of Disposable Pointy Sticks are irrelevant. They can keep crying for a tank as they remain forsaken from all groups.
---
Stick with shadow priest.
---
Found the salty bitch.
---
This is exactly it.
---
If it happened how it was described in the original comment, a pull went wrong from a tank being slightly reckless. Warlock chimes in and says "I've always seen other tanks do it this way in the past". There's nothing in his post to suggest this wasn't done in a reasonably polite manner.
---
This is where the tank *should say* "ah ok, fair enough" and the conversation ends right there. You don't start telling someone their opinion is invalid just because they happen to have a few greens, that's downright toxic. That act alone is what escalated the whole situation. When the warlock explained the greens he had are actually good, that was a second opportunity for the tank to accept that and swallow his ego, but he didn't. He let his ego get in the way, and it turned an otherwise relatively harmless situation into a salt mine for the rest of the dungeon.
---
The warlock pulling threat for the remainder of the dungeon out of spite was also a dick move, but I would argue it would *never have happened* if the tank hadn't set it in motion.
---
They make solid pocket healers right? That's my main goal. Pvp premades.
---
Spy warning: Stealth nearby!
---
Maybe cause they never did it 15 years ago? Not hard to grasp.
---
Curreny end game bosses and they cleared.
---
/clap
---
Dont have nothing nice to say then shut the fuck up and go hide in your dark carve you trolls.
---
Check out one of the earlier comments, another dude spotted it as well - think it might have been a little &lt;Miss&gt; on their part.
---
Neat plates will do this.
---
So you used the comments of this thread to form your opinion and then comment on this thread?
---
Druid is always the least played, and the most versatile class.
---
They can tank, heal, DPS and a bunch of other stuff like stealth and battle res.
---
They're not the best in each respective role, but I'm always happy to have a druid in the party.
---
Yeah just conserve mana and pop out of shadow to heal.
---
Up until phase 2, I mainly saw ally being the assholes  
---
But not phase 2 is out. I got to say I've done this with my guild. Called for backup that is.
---
You might be able to grind blasted lands at off peak hours, it's not a very popular zone usually. Silithus works too, but it's mostly elites and that farming area in northwest, which is probably still being farmed.
---
Well you either spend 15 days levelling a new toon or wait a year just to play again. Your choice.
---
did it with priest/warrior at 60.  it is slow though
---
I know right. I must of forgotten that war is meant to be "fair"...
---
I've never been killed by a party of alliance while minding my own business. They have morals and a code about being fair.
---
The main nerf is buffs no longer registering in combat log. So players can ride right past you and spy wouldn't go off if you don't mouse over them.
---
See my reply to QuinteX1994.
---
I appreciate the response.  I just would like to know the rationale?  Is it going to go up in price later as more people make twinks do you think?  Or will it go down as more people farm etc.
---
Lmao both sides do all the bullshit everyone complains about.
---
 Bruh the difference between the 2 is astounding and the fact you're even comparing them is... Wow. 
---
No, they're not the same. And I don't think and psychologist would agree with you, either. 
---
A big thing you're missing here is anonymity and the fact that... It's a fucking game. Do they do it to piss others off? Yeah probably.
---
Unlike an animal that you're torturing the other player can... Leave? Quest somewhere else? Do dungeons? The only one torturing you is yourself.
---
I say that as someone still levelling and trying to run BRD on a server where the opposite faction has a lot more players and is going though this shit.
---
It's frustrating, yes, but it's not comparable to torturing animals. Wake up to yourself.
---
Is there any reason besides Savage gladiator chain a healer or DPS would farm arena?
---
Vanilla was designed around idea that people like to socialize.  
---
This is why it have tons of quests that are impossible to solo.  
---
It was like incentive for people to group up.  
---
But Blizzard later found that majority of players don't want this. Players where really inventive to do quests solo, including partial pulling, kiting, etc.  
---
Actually exactly same happen now with PvP - active ganking should have lead to players grouping up and questing in a party of 5. But nobody want to do this, so they are killed again and again.   
---
All of this lead to retail leveling, where you could finish every quest solo.  
---
And if you remember original Vanilla, before 1.8 (?) where half of the mobs where elite - it was designed to be completely played in parties)
---
Honestly, I would rather like being able to dual spec. That was one of the best additions, imo, before I stopped playing. It made running dungeons viable again as you needed more gear and you were able to fill more rolls. I played a shaman after tanking through TBC and I loved being able to either heal or dps.
---
Fresh dinged glass cannon with tier shoulders @ 1:30
---
We don't really have another catchy phrase in our vocabulary to describe what is happening here. One-combo'd? Nobody says that. I'd say that so long as we define the shot as one fluid continuous attack, which this is, we're good. We can say 'one hit' if we mean a single ability.
---
Well the difference you see now is people are trying to convince more horde to come to HS since xfers are open for horde. 
---
Guy above basically said if you don't wanna be able to do anything in the open world, want to find a good guild or do dungeons easily then come on over. At least you can gank on a rogue!
---
If you fuck yourself over for world PVP 3 weeks before BGs then I honestly think it's a bad move.
---
Sry i meant to comment on the owner of the meme really sorry fellow ally mate .

We’re not doing your homework for you...

LFG'd. Whatever. The point's the same.
---
probably a raid forming on an RP server before heading out to hunt alliance/raid a city
---
If you are in a party with another shaman, are there any totems that will stack? All I can think of are the damage dealing fire totems and grounding totems. I seem to recall healing stream stacking, but it looks like they don't, so that may have been BC.
---
Yes its normal, the zone is incomplete until a later phase opens it up
---
Mate, if you think I’m going to thank you for lowering my queue times, you’re insane (assuming you’re alliance). Bar none, the most significant effect felt on stalagg from people fleeing to heartseeker is the even more severe faction imbalance. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad you found something that works better for you, but I’d 10x rather have queues that lasted a few weeks longer if it would mean alliance having a bigger piece of the pie.
---
I really like shammies just because if you hold out  and get some decent gear you can be pretty nuts in PvP as ele or enhancement
---
With a geared 3 man (which is how I run it) you get runs in ~10 mins, a little less if you want. This means you can clear a couple extra dudes for junk drops bc of the instance lock, we do the lashers in the big room bc their grays are nice to vendor.
---
Water essence is 25g on my server, crystals are 50, and you get about one an hour of each. I feel like I’ve been really lucky w crystals and gotten more than 1 per hour, but that’s neither here nor there. That brings you to 75, which means you need 35g/hr of junk drops and herbs for your group which you meet easily, since ghost shrooms are a gold and a few boss drops are up to 5g.
---
Am I missing something? 120/3=40gph for everyone in the group if you split it all.
---
Edit: forgot about Thorium, which is an extra 3.5g a stack (10g an hour? A little more) and the books, which are really inconsistent but add a bit of average gph to the runs.
---
Whilst I do agree, definitely. But at least the clips in Nerf Sap are pretty long, "duels" ranging from 10secs to prolly over a minute each time. And the only times he misses a lot at least in Nerf Sap is against orcs and Cheap Shot/Kidney Shot. Which is reasonable.
---
Between two of your account work
---
In this context in can mean the opponent has zero room for counterplay.
---
&gt; In a fully world buffed situation white crit cap doesnt matter. 
---
Explain.
---
Yes. Ban'thok sash is pre-raid bis for casters and ok for healers, and the ring from that boss is decent for both casters and healers.
---
Dwarf Priests are #2 camping target, gnome mage is #1
---
can't wait for his lvl 36 raids run /s 
---
He's nutty.
---
I mean, it's nice when they sheep a caster or an incoming patrol or something. Especially if they use a macro that marks it at the same time.
---
Thank you!
---
Idk man I sold the only papal fez on my server at the time now there are 3 up that I doubt will get sold for a while so things are being farmed, I’m seeing more and more twinks guilds recruiting so if you have things that you can set the price without competition I’d put those up now at least.
---
Welp... time to level my WAR think with double ENG.  That video was amazing!
---
Can you move while throwing the grenades?
---
The stupid, it burns.
---
If they merged your server, they would also be merging all the DPS players - like you - who refuse to heal or tank, and whine about not getting into groups (or about the tank reserving all the DPS gear).
---
What you want is for a bunch of tanks and healers to magically appear *clue* terrible DPS find trouble getting dungeon groups everywhere */endclue*.
---
They're one of my favorites to play in random WSG/AV
---
Wear all plate melee gear (tier gear ideally) but fill your rings/neck/cape with a bit of caster gear, use a super-fast weapon like the Gavel of Qiraji Authority (2.2 speed), and just glue yourself to the first enemy healer you see whenever a fight breaks out, judging seal of light for the healing and keeping up seal of justice or crusader.
---
Then use the fact that you're basically immortal *and* can reach total immunity to pushback to just keep glued onto that healer until either your team wins the fight or, usually, loses anyways because they didn't capitalize on the fact that the enemy team was effectively down one healer with all the pushback and stuns you're dishing out while the enemy team scrambles to get you off them.
---
It's not the best or most effective playstyle and it'll definitely turn a lot of heads, but it's fuckin hilarious to play just being a constant frustration for the enemy healers, making it hard to do their job while their team mostly ignores their cries to get you off them for even just 5 seconds.
---
I think you put too much faith in the WoW Classic playerbase.  The only reason we litteraly destroy MC and Onyxia is because of gear optimisation and insane DPS output.  Once boss start having any kind of mechanic that require DPS to use their brain most guild will hit a wall.  On Baron Gadon I often have Ignite Mana for 10+ second as a healer wich is unacceptable and yet we  can one shot Rag.  Right now the gear is carrying us through the raids not the skills.  Wait for Vaela &amp; Nef xD
---
I use neatplates for my nova/slows etc, but how do I get it to show the enemy's timers? Like for the rogue's sprint/evasion?
---
Yep. This sub paints it like Alliance is always the victim, but there are often two sides to it.
---
Esfand and Asmongold were talking about how hard they're going to camp the horde before phase two came out and people started caring about world PvP. Now all they do is whine and threaten to transfer because they think they're the only ones getting ganked.
---
As amazing as it may sound, for some people this game isn't about brainless min-maxing, but rather the journey and having fun. If it were retail I would understand going for BiS items but in Classic you will be able to faceroll all current raids in blues so idk what's the point other than time gained.
---
I only do this when it’s not 1v1. If it is 1v1 fair is fair. If not I will come at you with the same disadvantage that you came at me with. ❤️
---
doesn't matter, got honor.
---
I’m levelling as balance atm and it’s great fun.
---
I went into resto first to get insect swarm, but have now just repsecced to go full balance and boomkin form to try it out.
---
I’ve had people stop as I’m fighting a mob and just say “respect”. 
---
Critting on your openers is so satisfying. Basically takes a mob to half hp
---
Thanks!
---
That's a good point. Thanks for that insight.
---
I’m not saying don’t try to learn and become a good tank I’m saying it’s smart to first get comfortable with things before just jumping into the most important role
---
i thought Tirisfal Glade was a horde territory? I don't believe Alliance can initiate combat there, and you're unflagged by default.
---
This was awesome. I hope to see more.
---
Glad you're adapting, I find It's actually getting harder for me. It doesn't help I play a dps warrior. People constantly ask me to tank, and just thinking about it stresses me out so much that I sometimes just log off. Or when I'm on a kill quest and meet another player, rather than asking him to group up and get done quicker, I just leave the area. I started playing Classic with some people from my old retail guild which sadly fell apart, but most of them quit already. The guild I'm in now is quite active, but I'm not familiar with most members.
---
Nah. Just dive right in. "most important role" isn't saying much, when the competition is a role that's allowed to be half-AFK as long as they keep your bar up, and one that's literally disposable.
---

Look at all the brain dead zug zugs.
---
You thought you wanted PvP but you didn't.
---
People who have been banking them will all be dropping them at the same time when bgs launch
---
Ret aura for farming during downtime, Pursuit for pvp during downtime
---
Yeah I added the comment somewhere else the times come from classic aura durations, after I started enabling and disabling add-ons to see what was what.
---
It's weird, my server has a bucketload of hunters. Maybe it's an alliance/horde thing?
---
Jeez if only my PVP server was this organized
---
I think the overwhelming majority of players would move onto whatever new server they choose to bring out and the old classic servers would empty.
---
His username checks out lol
---
A player who utilizes the druids hybrid abilities can easily change a fight, way more often thna someone just healing, or just dpsing. It's a top notch class in the right hands!
---
Idk why fury's bother with the sword unless they want to fury tank since it actually sims pretty badly, especially considering its cost. Dal'Rends are better (compared to Q'S+Mirah's Song) and really not that hard to get, especially if you're willing to tank since you can just reserve them and do the run with a bunch of hunters/casters looking for other items. Imo it's edgemaster's (bought mine at lvl 45ish for 250g back when everyone was leveling and prices were low) &gt; epic mount &gt; lionheart.
---
Is 2 Arcane Crystals and 2 Essences lucky or unlucky or usual? Without droprates the calculation isn't quite useful.
---
That's the point where you start to not give a fuck mate. If noone cba to tell you what to do when they know you are new to the dungeon then you pull however you want and play bosses like in the guides. And if anyone dares to complain, you tell them to go suck a dick, literally.
---
Yeah it is scary and as you said quite horrifying to have such an experience, but the only way to overcome fear is by doing what you are fearing. I know how it feels, been there, tanking for years already, have seen it all. 
---
Last advice I can give is to watch a tank on twitch who is running a dungeon that you are afraid of. So you kinda know route.
---
Just continue leveling and once you have enough gold just buy your mount then. There's no real reason to go out of your way to farm gold at that level.
---
I'm a healer and almost always end up leading the group. I have markers macro's to keys and I usually get the tank in voice chat to walk them through fights. Being a tank shouldn't mean you know the dungeon like the back of your hand 👍🏼
---
You are most welcome. Beep boop.
---
I can think of a couple of items that are green and pve BiS for my own class (lock), including current phase raid drops. Shoulders with 30+ shadow damage and cloak with 21+ shadow damage.
---
He's Horde on Gehennas, what do you expect?
---
avg horde player on gehennas 6 keybinds total lmao
---
Why not? If you dont like how classic works, retail is a thing
---
Level up, if your currently swooning over the idea of getting your lvl40 mount but don't have anywhere near enough cash it's too late. You need to be fiscally conservative from LVL 1 through to LVL 40 to ensure U will have enough. 
---
If you just want gold for some juicy loot then sure find a good gold farm for your level. 
---
If you want long term gold making ability please level up. The amount of gold U can make at lvl40 per hour is insignificant to that which U make at lvl 60
---
I feel bad for you. Hope everything turns out all right :)
---
I generally don’t pay attention to what type of building something is. I’m a new WoW player, so I kinda just remember where a building is, not what the building is. Could you tell me where the saw mills are?
---
Did you not look at timestamps?? I was the second person to comment on this thread
---
Hell did you even take time to read my comment?? I said
---
&gt;And yet looking at all the replies from Horde on Heartseeker **since I gave my opinion**
---
This is "baby yoda" from disney's new show the mandalorian. There is no proof atm that this is acually baby yoda though.
---
You don't need to clear your target.  The targetenemy and targetenemyplayer macros just cycle through them.
---
Totally. I just want to get my mount as soon as I can, I only have 40g right now and I’m tired of being so slow ha
---
I just made a Night Elf Hunter on Pagle. I'd be down for running together.
---
Game is doing damn fine based on server population at just a glance...
---
Too time consuming. I have other things in life
---
I'm currently missing 25k honor from yesterday, farmed during a 10 hour play session despite my honor book appearing to have updated.
---
I also got the eye. I don't know if I'm lucky or if other people are unlucky. My guild has been super helpful.
---
Next raid all core raiders will be donating 1 arcanite bar each. And people have also been donating money towards the ingots.
---
Ideally, ask your guild for help.
---
It's going to take a while to get either way. I've had my eye for about a month and got roughly half the mats.
---
That being said, buy as many arcane crystals as you can afford. If you're not getting any help it's probably gonna take a while to get all the bars. And unless you're buying ingots all of them that drop in your raids should go to you. That will also take some time depending on your luck with the drops.
---
Yup.  In my guild i am 1 of two hunters in the raid group.  We both have our leafs, but he has full t1 so i will get t1 spending min dkp.
---
Alliance is full of kids so they're the ones that complain
---
Naah, Everything im doing against the alliance, they have done to me. I'm not going to lay down and die while caring about the alliance that can't fathom that actions has consequences.
---
why cant you get away after max 1-2 deaths? im sorry but you just suck ass if youre literally camped forever.
---
I think we can outgear most of bwl aswell tho depending on how long until it actually releases. You really think vael cant be outgeared sorta?
---
Well it is called the horde
---
This looks like the default raid frame to me.  Get something like Grid if you want a better one.
---
Without follow multiboxing will be almost impossible outside of AV.
---
I multibox 4 mages and im all for the suicide blastwave runs :)
---
Add-on "Grid"
---
Will that make it more organised and less encroaching. Thank you
---
I'm having a blast at level 45. Leveling slow with a wow vet has been a treat. He heals and I charge every mob/ ally in sight.
---
2 runs. Then it dropped again at the 13th run
---
You can grind burning exiles in western arathi basin at that level. XP and very good gold if you are alone. I wouldn't recommend this during peak time tho as it is heavily farmed. On my server I can find it empty on off hours from time to time.
---
Yes that's absolutely been my feeling, and I leveled every class to 110 during Legion, which is the expansion I played most on retail.
---
My friend who still plays BfA tells me the situation is better, because they made mob levels dynamic (as in you can quest in Barrens at levels 10-60 and hellfire peninsula at levels 58-70). Same thing for dungeons, I think, and they removed the bonus xp from heirlooms and made mobs harder to kill, especially in dungeons. When these changes were implemented, a lot of wipes happened in low level dungeons and a lot of people whined.
---
And apparently, they plan on making it better yet. For the next expansion, shadowlands, they plan on doing a level squish (level 60 will be max) and making leveling much faster and giving the choice to new characters to level in any "expansion" they want. As in you can create a new character and decide that the expansion you love the most is MoP and you can start in Pandaria right away, experience quest chains there and get to max level by playing exclusively there. Or something like that.
---
Anyway, my complaints when I leveled in Legion were that leveling was too slow, the zones felt empty and obsolete (kind of like playing a dead mmo where you're the only player in the whole game - feels pointless and sad), quests were too easy and pretty braindead, and leveling with heirlooms (and sometimes even without), you were forced to skip the end of questchains in zones because you would level too fast compared to the quest progression. Also, your character progression would be exciting for the first maybe 20 levels because you would be learning a lot of new spells and talents and changing rotations, but not only was the class progression too spread out (as in at some point you'd go 10 or 15 levels without seeing anything new in terms of spells or talents), but also because it was too easy you'd usually have no reason to use your new tools anyway (think a rogue never using evasion or vanish because he never needs to, sticking to spamming sinister strike a few times and killing literally everything like this).
---
In vanilla, this is not a problem ... mostly. I still feel the same about character progression at around level 30-40. From there to 60, it feels to me like your class gameplay is pretty stagnant. It must depend on the class, all I can say is that it felt like that as a priest. But at least, things are hard, you need to group often or use strategy, some areas are really ruthless and you need to be really careful, the world is way more alive so world pvp and helping/being helped by allies makes it more interesting, and you can really feel your character getting stronger as you get more tools, gear and spell ranks. And every level you can look forward to that next talent point. All of that makes leveling funnier in classic, imo.
---
For sure. I understand that I don’t need my mount right now but I’d like to get it as soon as I can, I don’t expect to get it at lvl 40 but I’d like to know what I should be doing to help me get it as soon as possible. My partner that I’m lvling with is a paladin so he got a free mount and it sucks not being able to keep up with him
---
Because it's a horde?
---
Jokes on you, I don't have a girlfriend.
---
Thank you
---
It is, but many players will have come directly fro PVP zones, and will still be flagged.
---
Well, they certainly aint fuckin guys who are ugly AND fat
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info. I will try my luck there
---
Grid lets you configure raid frames, there are a bunch of things that do a similar task. [Here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/grid2/screenshots) are some screens of what it can look like.
---
PvP has different ruleset for hit rating and spell resist.
---
Melee is pretty much unaffected, so a low lvl meleer has near the same hit chance as against NPCs of the same lvl even against players 20+ lvls.
---
Spells also has a higher hit rate vs higher level players (vs  NPCs), but there's still a penalty the greater the level difference. ie. against targets 10 lvls higher, most of your spell casts will be resisted.
---
I play on EU-Mandokir, spanish server. According to that web that keeps census we outnumber alliance 70-30.... still get ganked all over the place. Come out of booty bay, 2 death squads corpse camping me.
---
What im trying to say with this is that everybody camps lowbies regardless of factions. Also i should get lvl 60 friends.
---
one shot in wow means one combo
---
In cases like these all you need is an other character.    
---
Sometimes you're simply forced to play another char for a bit, w/e.
---
We 3-manned it with 2 guldies and it dropped around  the 21st run. We saw the boss only twice for 30 runs tho
---
Because No....
---
Haha I’m not sure I’d go that far myself. The 19-29 brackets are my sweet spot
---
Westfall at sentinel hill, lumber camp at wpl, hearthglen at wpl, goblin area in stv, etc
---
Yes.  
---
But I don't understand about "guilds". You could queue as a raid, so it's possible to go into AV with 40 people from your guild.
---
play stupid games... have someone take pity on you I guess..?
---
I see now why you are in trouble so much!
---
If we went the night elf route, I would think we all would need to be night elf since they don’t start near other alliance races. Is that a thing people do? If so, what other classes should we aim for? Best in mind I am a super noob so I would need an easier build/role.
---
Edit: also, if I am completely wrong about us all having to be night elves, just lmk. I’m still very much learning this game. But if you are down, I think we can get u/bulletpr00ft with us. If three is enough, I’d like to do this!
---
This would make the horde win over time, because you end up jacked, the sex of your preference notices, you start going out more, not spending as much time on the computer, etc.
---
Then there will be no alliance left.
---
I’m in trouble a lot because Epstein Didn’t kill himself.
---
just your usual evening on Gehennas
---
In all my years of wow gotta say alliance in general have always been way more cowardly and always in packs very rarely get to 1v1 them and if you do feels like the entire server of alliance shows up a minute later
---
It's actually really good for world PvP when using a 2-hander. Auto-attacks hit really hard, so when either HoJ, sword talent or WF procs the damage is absolutely massive. All three combined and you're a bomb ready to explode at any moment.
---
Fuck man, on Thursday that actually took 20 mins. Some alliance rogue was cheap shorting him. And then after I dcd and got rolled back with no buff. 
---

I wouldn’t go as far as calling their left hand their girlfriend
---
Try and set unrealistically high prices here - target buyer is the speculator who is trying to get in last minute. Actual prices will be low since so many have been hoarded. Basically get out just before WSG launches not after.
---
sell solid stone on the AH
---
I just cba, I'll play and PAY when it chills out on the 10th.
---
So I had this issue. Made it unplayable. However I did 2 things, do a hard reset on my router, and then got a VPN. 
---
I tried everything before that and it made it unplayable
---
2 questions about MSBT
---
1. How can I disable Blizzard exp drops? I just want it to show on MSBT
---
2. How can i prevent spam for Windfury totem? I tried entering the spellID in the filter. Example: I swing my axe and I get "Windfury Totem!" in big text (I want to keep this). I also get "+windfury totem -windfury totem -windfury totem" which I want to remove
---
Would you also say there is a split in the community between Fifa and CoD? My point is that I believe them to be two entirely different communities, as the games are very different from each other. There might be an overlap, but whoever likes the one does not necessarily also like the other.
---
A split requires something to have been one before a split happens. This is not the case for Classic WoW and Retail WoW imo.
---
I see it as the opposite. For example my 20 to 30 alliance route looks something like this. Redridge&gt;duskwood&gt;wetlands&gt;redridge&gt;duskwood&gt;wetlands&gt;duskwood.
---
Whereas closer to 60 I try to slightly out level an area and do it in one go. Waiting till 54 to hit ungoro is my best example.
---
When you disregard pve servers its heavily towards horde side
---
Real men post their character name. Coward.
---
Grid2 for raid frames, HealComm for displaying/sharing incoming heals and using mouseover macros for all my heals / dispels. Grid2 is very lightweight and minimalistic, but can be configured to display pretty much everything you might need to see.
---
I'd say, keep the Arcanite Bars and find yourself a way to get gold in lower level zones/instances.
---
Hit two birds with one zone. Avoid the ganking and have no competition for farm.
---
The vast majority of "assholes" are horde though.
---
Let me lay it out for you so you don't think I'm saying this because "Undead look edgy so only edgy people play undead":
---
I will separate the entire playerbase in two groups. 
---
One group is the group of players who play wow to do everything, pve, pvp, grind, have fun, whatever. This population will be split 50/50 alliance/horde, approximately.
---
The second group is the group of players who will mainly focus on PvP. This group of players will be massively skewed towards more horde than alliance because of a primary cause, and a reactionary cause:
---
Horde have better racials for PvP, this is a fact. This is the primary cause for more pvp players picking horde. The reactionary cause for more pvp players picking horde is the fact that because the consensus is that more players will pick horde, then it will be easier to world pvp as horde, and thus a feedback loop of more pvpers picking horde begins.
---
So it has nothing to do with horde characters looking edgy as fuck as some might think.
---
Oh, and pvpers aren't necessarily assholes, but people who do what OP's griefer did are generally PvPers. This is why you see more posts complaining about horde behavior than alliance behavior.
---
You can adjust it so it isn't group specific and resize them which condenses them a lot.
---
I hear ya mate, lvl 51 mage trying to grind in western plaguelands, was getting 13k hr xp due to the constant ganking.  Decided to go back and aoe grind ZF, was killed 3 times before even leaving gadget, of course they got away from the guards too.
---
Treat control will be a  HUGE issue.  All my wipes on Onyxia are caused by warrior who get told to only white hit, they say in discord they only white hit and when you look at Details! log you can see Whirlwind, Mortal strike,etc. If people can't follow something as simple as "only white hit" I don't think they can do BWL unless they change mentality
---
it updated i was just being whiny
---
I mean... you're talking about Molten Core, where you can enter at level 54 and still get loot.
---
Soooooooooooooooo.
---
Highly recommend trying Dirge's kickin chimera chops, as well as luke-warm yak broth, have both been keepers as well, I'm gonna get to the chili at a later date, how did it taste?
---
A wise old nerd told me the secret to getting epic mount. "Dont die. Dont buy anything (save food/water), and sell EVERYTHING!"
---
Look man I’m all for cross faction shit-talking but you better leave tamiko-chan out of this
---
I like how it's been 15 years but all the Alliance are still babies. I wonder if the Horde is still composed of metalheads after all this time?
---
Harpies wearing bras.
---
Corpse camps for 40 minutes, but yeah sure.
---
Usual time is 8-10 days played. For a mage aoe grinding it can be faster. Lvl 45 is considered halfway
---
Nobody knows what it's suppose to be like because WoW Classic is basically a new game.  It's now part of the game like it or not.  Except for the loss of time due to corpse walking you don't really lose anything.  Just be patient and you will get there.
---
Everywhere I see people complaining about the pvp but I'm leveling an alt right now and it's fine.  I die 5-6x/h due to pvp but there's no loss of experience or gear when dying so it's not too bad.  I remember playing a rogue back in TBC and STV was 10x worst than it is right now.
---
I love how everyone assumes this person screwed over their group by taking this... Very likely as well that they were in a group with people who already had it, or with all people who didn’t need it.   
---
Also, totally boosts poison damage. And I believe the ratio is like 3:1 with spell power, like 87 extra poison damage per hit now.
---
What a surprise. That was the prediction.
---
U can but iirc backstab/ambush requires a dagger in MH
---
I’m in the same boat, lvl 48 rogue wielding thrash blade and Shadowblade each w/ fiery. Absolutely destroyed a 60 horde mage on Incendius (Repost I’m talking to you) when I gave him the big dick damage. Oh, and he even got the opener on me.... lol I love it. But yeah searing gorge and anywhere with death squads rolling around are cancer
---
Damn that's a badass drawing.
---
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out tossa
---
*Everyone liked that*
---
Horde have been occupying the Menethil / Theramore boat every day since Honor update went live. There's not much rhyme or reason, they're very vulnerable there, but... well. They're destroying lowbies.
---
You click and drag that little grey tab you see in the screenshot.  It will allow the frames to stack like you see instead of going across your screen.

---
That is pretty spiffy. I underestimated you hammer swingers!
---
Yeah in world pvp if youre fighting more than one caster youre usally fucked as a warrior because armor doesn't negate spell damage. Warriors and rogues are not very effective in the current zerg fest that world pvp is
---
Be gone scrub.
---
Sweet, sweet level 54 epic mount.....................
---
Anyway, the point is they could have acquired the loot at 54 and equipped them the moment they hit 60, completely denying the above statement.
---
Not sure why I had to explain that in a classic sub.
---
um
---
I feel like whenever there is an event or something alliance is able to compete as Salad Bakers is also very active and able to gather alot of manpower very quickly. But I ran to DM today and probably died like 15 Times there on my way to DM:North. But it's fine. I guess it could be worse
---
Believe it or not, some servers have far more alliance than horde.
---
OwO
---
You forgot to white out your nameplate, bud...
---
Death!!!
---
Say you don’t know.
---
At the same time you as a tank require some level of confidence and to be leading the group. That’s your role. There’s guides for instances like on wow head pretty in depth you can follow along through the instance.
---
Contested areas.
---
Oof, Alliance side login stats for Faerlina are about to crater.
---
The thing is the issue isn't really PvP happening, if that was the case then whining would have happened in P1 where lots of PvP, camping, ganking, city/town raids still happened.
---
If you look think about it more, a lot of the whining is really about PvP in the context of no BGs, overpopulated realms, faction imbalance, modern gaming with a "solved" game and perhaps the timing of the honour system. 
---
Somr of this could have been avoided if Blizzard were more competent and both Blizz and players had better foresight.
---
Though a lot of it was predicted/expected to be fair, so people should have know what they where getting into, nevertheless it's still a bit disappointing how it turned out.

---
You sound fun
---
Wait... That's illigal!
---
Yea, this guy breathes through his mouth and bumps into walls 100%
---
What's confusing? We are talking about pvp crits not PvE crit in 40 man raids. 1400ish is about standard for level 60 in pvp with pre raid BIS gear.
---
Level 53 is not critting 1400 unless for some reason he has twinked out.
---
This hits way too close to home, warlocks criting away with no threat redux. Think People Will adapt pretty fast to minor mechanics but big things like nef and twins Will put a stop.
---
Just report him already.  Blizzard looks down on harassment, even on a pvp server.  They many not do anything against him now, but if he has a pattern of it they'll take note on a later offense (and he's the type of person who that will definitely happen).
---
Was he getting dominated too much in PvP?
---
Cheers will have a look into it ! :)
---
AQ we get MH and OH dagger.
---
Making trouble in my neighborhood.
---
I will start off by saying I am not a good player. I get lost in the simplest dungeons. 
---
When I played a warrior I made it clear I was a meat shield and nothing more. I will hit things and keep aggro and do a fine job at that. 
---
I don’t know the path, I don’t know who to hit first I am possible the stupidest tank  who ever played.
---
Why are you having charge on 1 in Beserker stance?
---
Put charge on 1 in battle and intercept on 1 in beserker. easier.
---
Yea I’m just dreaming lol. Way too many hours for that. My first real, bis twink was a dual wield warrior level 39, so I might go for that then level him up to 49 for those beast mortal strikes with Kang the Decapitator. I also loved the 20-29 bracket as a warrior. Felt like such a tank.
---
I also have pendulum of doom which I’m gonna save if BC comes out so I can equip that on my shaman.

Nothing he said was wrong though.

---
Idk all these world PvP posts are from an alliance perspective even tho both sides do it
---
Alright, thanks for the clarification.
---
its not tho
---
Alright. Thanks for the clarification.
---
The "wait for mana" is appropriate in some groups for sure. However, if your group is good and the tanks not done, a couple casters can drink for the first 15 seconds of a fight before engaging in combat which has the side benefit of letting the tank get aggro. Now when I'm in a group where the tank cant hold aggro then I'm constantly telling him to let me drink because I know I'll need it all.
---
I’m a 49 rogue and have played rogue since vanilla. Don’t even both with stealth unless you need to skips mobs or for PvP to get an opener. It’s worthless and will slow you down far too much. Second, rogues are big on weapons. You essentially need to get the best weapons possible every 5-10 levels, this will help dramatically. But yeah, it’s kind of brutal. Leveling any class in the 30s and 40s sucks to be honest.
---
I love when tanks actually let the appropriate people mark and pull. It’s not always ideal for tanks to pull in every situation anyways. I’d rather hear from you that you’re new and need help than you pretend to know what to do and waste our time by wiping us over and over. Thank you for being vocal with people about needing help. It’s something we can all learn to do both in and out of WoW
---
I’ve done this before to people that were continually ganking mine or my guildies alts
---
Me and my friend getting spawn-killed, and then they camp right next to the fucking graveyard so we can’t get anywhere is no ~minor~ inconvenience. Sure it’s a part of the game, but that thing is just disgusting
---
Your main role as a priest in a premade is dispelling, after that comes healing / clutch fears, then blackout procs on flag carriers from rank1 SW:P. I didn't enjoy it but at least in 1v1 I was a beast.
---
Your always happy until you run strat ud and realise no one can dispel poison
---
You probably can't see *all* the content in Classic - Naxx saw ~90% of guilds that attempt it fail short of C'thun.
---
But you can see a lot of it.
---
Allies are 100% more cowardly
---
There were server transfers in classic.  There weren’t the populations we have today.
---
Yes and no good guild requires their members to get these kind of incredibly rare bis items, the next best reasonably obtainable bis item is perfectly acceptable.
---
Yeah I do not actually believe that people who play alliance are more honorable or better people. But it is much more likely at the moment to have this done to you by horde than alliance. Plus almost all (all but one?) of those are PvE.
---
It's funny because there was a lengthy period where only horde circlejerking was upvoted, that is until phase 2 came
---
