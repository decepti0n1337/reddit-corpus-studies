Thank you for leaving a comment, I was starting to feel like I was alone in thinking this.
---
You can do quests every game for rep?!
---
Usually no.  You can pug out of spec but within a guild it’s usually not accepted.  We have some that respec every reset.
---
You’re going to be hard pressed to find a raid spot for aq without any mc/bwl gear as a mage. So many insane pieces come from those raids.
---
If you have discord, turn off discord overlay.
---
Mocking blow taunts hunter pets to attack you. Also if mages try to sheep you for example,  mocking blow or shoot a mob. It will hit u and break sheep. Cleave is good in aoe fights obviously, but also can work wonders with SS up. Rend rogues first global.
---
I guess that's where we disagree, in every other WoW expansion except vanilla (not sure about the most recent ones BFA, legion, WoD, I quit after MoP) the arena PvP system awarded the skillful/talented rather than the 16 hours a day grinder.
---
Just respec frost for mc/bwl and then respec to fire for the rest of the week. The fire/frost spec can aoe grind or you can easily do fire for pvp.
---
Not OP but thus far I prefer warlock at the moment, despite being a modestly decked out 60 hunter but a still leveling warlock. So many potential annoyances with hunter are smoothed out as warlock.
---
- On hunter you have to visit a stable master to switch out pets. And you can only have three and really only two until level 60. A warlock carries all possible demon pets with them at all times and just needs to summon as appropriate.
---
- On hunter you need to level your pets separately from you, and this becomes a real pain if you have any interest in a rare. Too low of a level and it might as well be as if you had no pet / AI tank. On warlock your demons level with you automatically, even if you just dinged.
---
- On hunter you need to sacrifice space for arrows or bullets and they only have one use: as DPS consumables. On warlock you need to carry soul stones but they have multiple uses.
---
- Other than like trueshot aura, hunters don't bring much utility to groups specifically. Warlocks can summon (which in a way might be even better than mage teleports), can create healthstones for other people, and can create soulstones for healers and such to mitigate the annoyance of wipes.
---
I could go on but these are just some of the immediate things that come to mind. For me IMO hunters also feel very weird with mana management. Their pets using focus as a resource instead doesn't help. Warlocks etc using mana as a caster class makes more sense.
---
That bitch slap though 😂
---
Agreed,  in WSG/AB you had to be good at Pvp(micro play), and also good at the actual BG (macro play) to consistently win.
---
I think you might have misinterpreted what I said - I very much so love hunters and love them for all the reasons you just said. I have a level 60 hunter, which is why I don't want to do the grind on one again after the reroll. 
---
What I was saying is that hunters are rigid in the sense that your role is DPS. You're amazing at it, and that's what you do. Everything in your kit is to assist you in that aspect - be it picking off stragglers, pulling a mob off a healer until the tank can get it, or just straight blowing things up.
---
Druid is what I'm doing after our reroll, and I have a really hard time with their fluidity - you're the tank, the healer, and the dps depending on situation, and everything in your kit is to assist you with EVERYTHING. There's so much you have to consider that it makes me feel like I don't excell at any of them when I play it. I feel like Im just kind of there, watching everyone else while I figure out what the situation needs.
---
It’s still frowned upon.  Plenty of people are raid spec to make the run successful.  If you won’t be in raid spec, how can you ask that anyone else be?
---
Yes, AV is painfully boring
---
Raiding in a top 100 guild world on progress with top 100 + logs
---
I wouldn't say that; I enjoyed healing in Cata, especially Firelands HC was extremely fun and challenging. Solohealing HC Baleroc was the most fun I ever had on a healer.
---
I then quit and started playing in WoD again and healing was so boring because everyone just aoehealed everything. Mana was no issue and the tank took no dmg juggling his cds. It really felt braindead like lfr :/
---
This happened to me for a while to until i got new RAM
---
Paid 350g for mine with borrowed money the day I got my eye from Domo. Got my staff that night. No regrets.
---
doesnt work tried before
---
All ur base are belong to us
---
wanna chain heal random targets for an hour a week then log and play a more fun class?
---
try shaman
---
I wouldn't doubt it if he was high as a kite or drunk, but thats the point. You could never compete in competitive pvp in arena for other expansions because you were serious and wanted to rank up. But vanilla promotes this mindless grind and calls it PvP
---
Calling bullshit
---
you can see it with the BoE T1 pieces.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Everyr other class BoE pieces, 450-750 gold each Sell within hours.
---
Druids BoE pieces 60-90gold. Sits all day.
---
Ample gear&lt;playing a good healing class
---
Oof
---
While I acknowledge egregious being a good resto shaman I'll stand by the opinion that you can't claim somebody "might not be a healer" coz they didn't find MC enjoyable to heal. Like come on, you cant say somebody doesn't like Dpsing coz they don't like play frostbolt spam in raids. Same shit just different spell
---
Got it so if max rank Devo aura gives like +700  -- IF'd Priests probably "feel" like they have leather or mail armor in terms of physical damage mitigation I would guess?
---
Warcraft logs, wowprogress
---
Are there really any frost centred pve specs without 5/5 imp FB?
---
The game changed, and itemization changed too. Fury was not viable for a long time. Nothing to do with people not knowing.
---
In like wod I think I got banned for a few days for being afk in bg’s
---
My guild can't even kill rag
---
Why is blizzard rushing out content?
---
I haven’t played a mage in a lil bit but I think with 2/3 imp blizzard your CoC slow will override it and last longer which can be nice. I primarily used 3/3 though and never had many issues, granted I was just farming pirates and WPL undead to level.
---
I was also weighing up between lock and hunter for my first alt. This comment literally made my decision for me. Thanks!
---
The trick is, if there's no druid, don't talk about it. Then the gear doesn't drop.
---
Yep, exactly. I had my wife as my pocket healer out of group while leveling my warlock. As soon as i was able to tag mobs that were green to her I was able to get 100%xp while she was out of group. That is about the most effective way to level outside of a dedicated dungeon aoe leveling team.
---
Probably warrior, probably fury, but idk, haven't looked at 2h builds at all
---
Remove them.  Your fears are correct, this type of attitude is poison to the morale of a good raid group.
---
&gt;It seems he was an asshole because he crippled his damage to get loot over other members.
---
that's why you don't give gear to underperforming members.
---
Could you elaborate on why you dislike frost?
---
there are far better pieces for the other slots, so yes you would.
---
As far as I recall Rift’s team panicked because of ESO (?) where a lot of people swapped from their game. Unfortunately when those droves of people wanted to come back, realising they prefered Rift a ton more, the game had changed beyond recognition.
---
2/3 was better on p servers where blizzards slow was more immediate and some mobs moved slower. Also people generally had an easier time gearing so being Mana to damage inefficient with the second blizzard was not as much of an issue. 
---
3/3 is better for live since the tick for the initial slow isn't very consistent and people don't have 7k Mana for an extra coc/bliz. 
---
At least imo, it makes it a lot easier. You can do farming with 2/3 and I have. It's just harder.
---
This is the thing ive been looking for, do you know where you got this info from?
---
BRE is very good, yes. But it can be argue'd they are about the same because BRE's armor reduction is very good but in general but not very useful versus plate wearers. Also, 3.4 speed (310 top end damage) on BRE is not ideal versus the 3.8 speed of R14 (353 top end damage). Also, R14 gives 25 stam which is VERY important for warrior pvp and 26 strength (52AP). Also keep in mind, BRE stacks up to three times and in PVP, fights do not last long enough for you to stack 3 times consistently.
---
R14 PROS: 250 more HP, 52 more AP, 43 more top end damage.
---
BRE PROS: Chance on hit to ignore armor
---
You can decide which one is better for you in the situation and change your weapon depending on the matchup.
---
My problem with this is it recommends everyone stacking FR and bringing 13-15 healers which seems like absolute overkill. Strategies don’t seem bad though.
---
Occasionally you'll see people calling out folks that AFK, but I've never seen anything come of that lol.
---
I've been looking at it. I dont have to be the best of the best. Just want to be able to have fun and that's where I usually have the most fun is 2h dps
---
That first soundtrack, is it from banjo kazooie?
---
There are none in classic. Warriors Horde side can do ok, but it’s distinctly worse than dual wielding.  
---
For PVP, Arms Warriors and Survival Hunter probably. But the hunter only melee’s when they need to.
---
[removed]
---
My guild allows it. We are a pretty casual relaxed guild, but even with people fooling around in their pvp specs we clear MC in 90min. The content is very easy atm.
---
No it doesn't . If you didn't get fireballed in phase 2 and got high threat in the transition you get aggro without doing anything when she's landing. Everyone needs to chill until tank got more threat than everyone else.
---
This is off topic a bit, but do you know if they ever fixed priest shield negating melee crits? I've been leveling my healer alt and haven't fought a priest on my rogue lately to see if this is still the case.
---
Dude, we had a person in our raid who ran with a green level 48 ring of the bear for THREE weeks before he was booted for lack of ingame time and non-motivation to improve his character. He didnt even bother to get the blackstone ring which you can two men with a shaman or buy for 20g from a brainAFK farming spriest/warlock/mage/hunter.
---
There are people who not quite as motivated as others and there are people who can't farm the most basic of items.
---
Sure, not everybody needs to invest 500 runs into savage gladiator chain and the DM tribute chest is good as well.
---
But not farming lvl 48 blues? C'mon.
---
Did you happen to edit the Jason Bourne movies?
---
Sm/ruin is what I’m speccing as. Good for all around fun. I’ve read it’s a great spec for raid and pvp!
---
Confirmed, it is from Banjo Kazooie’s snow level. Freezeezy Peak.
---
Think i’m gonna go buy that old game right now
---
For Warriors, there's literally nothing better for PVE until AQ40 hits - there's nothing else that time sink could be directed toward.
---
Is it comparable to paly? Because that's my main right now
---
&gt; if they'll have you
---
Hardcore guilds only recruit people with extensive experience or people who have already got the gear and are putting up the numbers.
---
If he hasn’t got a history with a guild like that then none of them will take him unless he applies and shows his gear/dps logs/ui/alts/everything else.
---
Source: used to be in one, they’re the kind you need to apply for not the ones who advertise in chat looking for more members.
---
I don't even bother trying to explain it, anymore. I just swim in their tears.
---
Anyone know how to make it so that Luna frames positions are referenced to the center of my screen? I play on my laptop and sometimes with an external monitor. I also toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode. All of these modes shift my luna frames differently, very annoying.
---
“Horde only wins in wpvp because of the better racials” yep that seems to be the case for sure!
---
True silver should be all that’s needed, not Arcanite.
---
Respect for twinsanity music
---
&gt; You're just buying into the victim complex reddit has
---
Just open your eyes. Go anywhere and take a look around you.
---
The entrance to BRD? There's always 3-10 Horde standing around. Same goes for pretty much any other instance.
---
&gt;And counterpoint, I got ganked over and over in blasted lands last night by two alliance rogues.
---
WOW, this guy got ganked by rogues. I couldn't imagine. 
---
I'm not saying Horde don't ever get ganked, I'm saying it's far worse on the Alliance side.
---
You should try it some time.
---
Why? Onslaught, ToEP, Perds, BRE, Mageblade, QSR etc. etc. will hold well into the content, sometimes even deep into Naxxramas.
---
Sure, give the carried players some tier gear and a Vendorstrike, but would you want to hand over gear to somebody who runs around like a fresh 60 with no desire to improve his gear outside of raids?
---
&gt; Tbh it’s an honor. Like you said, it’s like they chose me as the strongest warrior around. Almost like some sort of mating ritual lol.
---
Bruh stop I wasn’t expecting to get a boner here
---
I had the same issue, updating my audio drivers made it go away.  Addons weren’t part of the issue.
---
You’re gonna want a fury warrior on horde specifically. Since we have windfury totem you have play both 2h fury for pve and than 2h arms for PvP.
---
Thanks for the video. I couldn't stop laughing lol
---
Why did they put the water and fish there then?
---
Already finished it, it's great &lt;3
---
Fight club discord if you really want to learn to tank, but its for pretty hardcore players. Don't expect to go in and have every basic questioned addressed.
---
We don't have players that protect healers either. 
---
Chicken and egg.
---
My guild and I are all ally
---
Beautiful zone.  However, I feel like the draw distance is inherently worse than it used to be in Vanilla and this zone greatly exaggerates the effect - pop in galore.
---
2h warrior is very viable.
---
Get a weapon swing timer and make this macro:
---
/stopattack
---
/cast Slam
---
/startattack
---
Probably gets outperformed by DW fury warriors in MC but fuck it it’s still good. It’ll also get worse and worse as fights get harder/longer (execute phase for 2h is lackluster)
---
&gt; It seems he was an asshole because he crippled his damage to get loot over other members.
---
As a former rogue CL, that shit should have been picked up pretty fast. I always kept an eye on my members gear and would plug it in to various spreadsheets and compare that to the logs etc. I wasn’t a dick about it, I’d always use the patchwerk style DPS check fights for the comparison where you literally run to the boss and do your rotation.. but if you were only putting up 50% your theoretical max and everyone else was doing 90%+? Time for a chat buddy. Certainly you aren’t getting given loot priority over anybody else because you suck. And to be fair, mostly it was somebody missing some understanding about their class and was pretty easily fixed.
---
In my current guild I tripled another rogues DPS in one week with a 10 minute talk. Much more casual guild this time around and he just didn’t know what to do, once I filled him in he was sorted.
---
My fav thing to do as horde is run to Balinda and then turn around and frost shock the back of the alliance zerg.  I literally just walk behind the entire team pick off one at a time and nobody helps the people I shock.  Most of the time the people I shock dont even get off their mount until they are half health either.  Eventually the alliance zerg runs out of steam due to attrition and they sit around wondering why.
---
Like I said. BRE is better for group fights in BG. Cleave= High uptime. 3x Stacks BRE is as good as Might of Menethil+Its a sword.
---
Its BRE/MOM/EOI&gt;r14
---
edit: ofc BRE was just an example. IF you compare PvE gear from AQ/Naxx/BWL etc. with PvP gear it becomes clear that PvP Gear is not THE BEST gear. Its Good ofc. but there are a lot of alternatives that are as good for most classes. (Most classes dont even benefit from highest rank because other gear is as good)
---
depends on whether or not they release BWL in the nerfed version or not as they have done with MC and Onyxia. If its unnerfed, oh boy it will be fun to watch.
---
That's BiS raid gear - by definition it's the best you can get. It's not remotely the requirement/minimum standard for raiding. That's the end goal if you will, though many times the difference between what you have and the BiS will amount to very little dmg increase.
---
I can't even find nodes its so overmined now that layering is gone.
---
Dude there hasn't been a raid released since the release of classic. This isn't rushed.
---
In case you're horde, do you actually get thrown into running AVs often? I feel like that shouldn't happen that much since most horde like to stick around until it ends, because queues are long
---
Maybe I was doing shadow wrong (respecced to it from 40-45, hated it) but imo you’ll have a much easier time going disc-holy smite spec, primarily healing dungeons for the final grind, and soloing content at a minimally slower pace than shadow. It’s boring, but spamming smite does pretty great and comparable damage. As a healing priest, you can begin BRD at 50-51, LBRS at 53/54, and everything else 56/57 with the exception of Strat UD and UBRS
---
Nah. Never rolling human. Such ugly animations.
---
I'd rather put in the extra work to make my NE top notch.
---
Have you gone to the book in Tanaris? I didn’t have to do the goblin quest after that it just automatically gives you the specialization you choose.
---
Ahh great! I kept meaning to (and forgetting to) ask on that daily question thread about you. I couldn’t remember your username and I haven’t seen one of your videos for aaaages. 
---
Glad you’re still making them. I will make sure I subscribe on YouTube this time.
---
&gt;heroic strike is high threat per damage.
---
No, it's a flat +threat modifier.
---
Thanks to you for keeping downvoting me, i'm glad you are insterested in my opinion.
---
I really hate desolace. Even more so if you don't have a mount. Id just skip it if it was me.
---
That's a shit guild then.
---
Sp if an ally was going to play 2h what would you rather them be? It seems like options are warrior or paladin.
---
1k runs my ass
---
&gt;Daggers are in a lot less demand and generally just as good.
---
Yeah, just sacrifice your gloves slot for +5 dagger gloves instead of taking something good, like gauntlets of might.
---
quality! thumbs up and subscribe
---
You make music? Link me some of your stuff :D I'm sure most people have it in them, it's hard to stick to things though when it gets challenging I think, that's where the passion comes in handy
---
I've been raiding a month and only seen 4 pieces of T1 drop, 3 of them last night. Only piece of T2 has been the helm once, lost it to our other resto druid...hopefully RNG gets better.
---
We bring a casual druid each week now since banks full of druid tier
---
When I start a BG I inspect all the warriors to see who I am going to healbot.  The funny thing is, whenever I click on a warrior to inspect them they are always inspecting another warrior.  
---
Maybe I should just ask in raid chat which warrior has the biggest dick and save myself some time.
---
Not angry in the least, it’s entirely as I expected. Much as people like to shit all over retail, the changes it went through were at their core because people refuse to get along and not be dicks/create drama. Same thing is happening here.
---
And with any luck a more elegant solution is incoming, though I’m not sure why you’re complaining that blizzard fixed an exploit before it made its way to your games... are people ever happy? If they leave something they complain. If they fix something they complain.
---
Nice
---
Pretty much any time for Horde on Arugal OCE sees 25-50 min queues. Last night was definitely the longest queues averaging 40 minutes. I am a solo player and always select first available.
---
I got sbowblled off iceblood.  Too bad for them I'm a mage and have blink
---
Search up drain tanking spec
---
I have done Rag every week since the 2nd week of Classic.
---
I have never seen Stormrage pants drop.
---
Ever. It's a 1% chance to have gone this long without seeing a single Stormrage ever drop.
---
You don't have to but there are some that are super useful and will make PvP easier.
---
First up, simple stance dance macros:
---
\#Showtooltip Intercept  
---
/cast Berzerker Stance  
---
/cast Intercept
---
This will swap you to Berzerker stance and cast Intercept. Since changing stance doesn't activate the global cooldown one button press will change stance and use the ability all in one. It's useful to change your buttons for Charge, Disarm, Whirlwind (basically any ability linked to a specific stance) to a macro with the stance change in first.   
---
If you are already in the correct stance then it will just act like the ability as normal.
---
These make switching stances to use important abilities like Intercept much faster.
---
There are also more complex macros.    
---
Example:
---
\#show [equipped:Shields] Shield Bash; Pummel  
---
/cast [equipped:Shields,stance:1/2] Shield Bash; [equipped:Shields] Defensive Stance; [stance:3] Pummel; Berserker Stance
---
This will show the Shield Bash tooltip when you have a shield, Pummel otherwise.   
---
If you have a shield equipped and you're in Battle/Defensive, it casts Shield Bash. If you have a shield but are in Berserker Stance, it will change you to Defensive. If you are in Berzerker Stance, it casts pummel. If you don't have a shield and aren't in Berzerker Stance it changes you to Berzerker stance.
---
So basically that macro becomes your 'spell interrupt' button. No matter what the conditions, if you spam that button you'll use a spell interrupt ability of some sort.
---
I'd recommend first playing around with some of the simpler ones, simple stance changes and equipment swaps. Then if you want to look up some more complex ones. You can find them quite easy through Google.
---
2 am isn't even that late
---
when it's not a school night sometimes i stay up until like 5 am no joke
---
You can 10 man MC my dude. We routinely bring sub 60s with no problems and no wipes. If youre at this point, then maybe your guild just isnt any good.
---
That's genius, I'm gonna give it a try. Thanks!
---
Yes that is true, but a lot of people don't understand that and take shgy when horde is trying to push back a turtle.
---
not the case at all with windfury totem and hamstring spam.
---
I think the blue ones are from Strath UD Magistrate boss unless there's another one I didn't know about.
---
This only works if the monster would give exp to the powerleveler. For a level 60 that means you only get full exp on level 48 or above (hence that hinterlands video), on a level 45 you'll get exp proportionate to the damage you do. Hinterlands actually had mobs on both sides of this line and so you'll basically get 10 xp for some and full exp for others.
---
because almost every druid ability is op in its own way
---
reducing enemy power and armor, instagib moonfire, insta heal, every crit in bear form is 5 rage, engaging with cat go to bear...2 heals over time and thorn and your tank will never lose agro, buffing others is really fun and you will make a lot of friends...fiery fire for pull and debuff and apply demoralizing and spam maul or swipe ezz, for dp cat just shred...we also have stealth that is huge, movement speed, we can cancel roots and slow and polis, only class that can dispel curses. mark of the will is just awesome stats...
---
A lot of bosses that were gear checks in Vanilla won't be gear checks in Classic. There are so many players doing DPS in MC that would be equivalent to what player in Vanilla would be first breaking in Naxx. There were people that thought reaching 1k+ DPS in Vanilla wasn't even possible and we already have people breaking that milestone in MC. Some people have even doubled the number and broke 2k dps. It's also not only the top players that are doing better, even lower level players are doing way more DPS. Even the 4000th best player on Warcraftlogs is doing 600+ DPS, which was considered a benchmark number in original Naxx.
---
Imagine playing a human in a fantasy game tho
---
that's why I did it.
---
Thanks again for all the helpful advice. When I get home tonight , changes are a coming.  I will post a montage and or update video one day.
---
#nochanges
---
Thanks for subscribing to me my man, I stopped uploading to Reddit for a little while but I'm gonna start again :D
---
Nah with iron foe and flurry axe
---
Found the spy! Get him!!!
---
Yaaaaaaas
---
&gt; I am a firm believer of the player with the best skill, gets the best gear/rewards. 
---
In my opinion the player who puts in the most effort should be rewarded with the best gear/rewards. Classic is less about skill and more about effort and preparation. Think of it as a marathon and not a sprint - you might be able to run faster, but the other guy runs further.
---
Also note that Blizzard generally been cool about most things you can do with two accounts, such as trading yourself on neutral AH, or /who people to find our their position for PvP. The only thing they really frown upon is any kind of Kill Trading, altho they don't seem to take much action with it. Anyway, have fun with both accounts!
---
Honestly idk and I've even seen some of the theory guys on the warrior discords say slow OH is better because it will eat fewer flurry stacks. I can't really think of a better reason than that for using a fast one, so consider my statement above redacted.
---
Are you low?
---
Nah you would never be sword spec with a 1 hander.
---
Oh sweet, this guy makes good stuff.
---
I am going to watch tonight. 
---
Ok, I promise tonight is the night I setup all my macros and change my keybinds to things that are actually efficient and useful and intelligent.
---
I meant to do this ages ago but ended up just using my crappy setup well past 60 because it was just too much hassle to change it.
---
&gt;but this week he took our guilds first Brutality Blade
---
There should be measures in place to avoid this. Like loot priorities.
---
You could also just grind most classes MMORPG style to the respective level cap, rofl your way to weekly conqueror (?) point cap in 1500er+ games by playing an hour on each char, have the usual suspects ready to go and just roll with the flavor of the month to 2k+ rating.
---
Arena was highly susceptible to people gaming the system to play the current OP class decently to get hilarious ratings.
---
The point still stands as you should know best: WoW was never really competitive and some patches did it slightly better and others botched it brutally.
---
LOL@MoP patch 5.0 or 5.2 in which warrior's avatar made them root immune and 20 or 30% more damage. Or RBG dudu solar beam, gorefiends grasp + 2 warriors with bloodbath and bladestorm. So, so broken.
---
And recklesness!!!
---
I sim about 5 dps less with perditions/CHT + ACLG compared to deathbringer/brutality blade + edgemasters. Not much, so both def viable. Another thing with edgemasters though is, for alliance, deathbringer, and other 1h axes, is basically res each raid, because you're the only non-human dw fury warrior, so it should be easy to get in a serious raid, unlike ACLG, daggers and also swords in general.
---
When you get hundreds of items dropping, eventually you win some.
---
You’re literally wrong though. I was following my wife around outside of party with my 60 priest, and she was killing elites outside of zf for around 500xp each. All I did was heal her. I asked her to tag one, then I killed it, and she only got around 100xp. This was literally just yesterday when we did this.
---
Brutality blade is much worse. Its way too slow to be a good off hand weapon for tanks. Mirahs song is about as good as brutality blade for OH tanking.
---
What do you mean your #1 on your server number one 8 in what?
---
&gt; pre-BiS for shadow DPS
---
If he's going to stick with a healing spec, he'll be spamming smite for solo content, which makes all the +shadow dmg gear in that list useless. He'll need to modify the pre-bis list to use +spell dmg gear instead.
---
Took me forever but now it’s cake.  You have to learn the perfect spot, how to face before you block, macro IB off and nova, pound that key, forward and jump.  Jump right after they do the attack.  I did 20 runs today no problem.  Once you get it...  also don’t pull the pat until you are a pro at it.
---
Lol... you’re intentionally gimping yourself going w/o engineering. Gg I guess?
---
[deleted]
---
Personally if I plan on doing PvP or dungeons I always get at least 2 stacks of water from a mage, just because I cba dealing with lazy ones. However, whenever a mage is LFG, waiting in que or waiting for a BG to begin I don't get why they don't just spam water. When within reason you should support you team any way you can - buffs, consumables etc. Even just 10 waters to a healer helps.
---
Don't get locked in on roles - you might be dps, but the fact is as a mage your role in PvP is primarily to CC and harass the other team (if you want to maximize your impact on the game that is).
---
Why are you here?
---
Im in the same boat haha. Pummlers for days
---
That's a weird way to play arms.
---
They can’t have freedom and sacrifice on the same character at the same time. So if you’re pocketing you won’t always have sacrifice up.
---
I like that one cause you run across less NPCs to the gy.
---
Can confirm that being on the receiving end of those wrecking balls is nasty. The walk back is nuts and low drop rates mean the crew will be in there for a good 30 minutes plus.
---
I did the backstab/improved sprint build for a week and didn’t top the meters in dungeons but it was fun and I enjoyed it.
---
Who was saying that?  Everyone I saw was saying that MC and Ony would be roflstomped loot pinatas.
---
Just don't. You take a lot more damage for marginal increase in threat. If your damage really matters.. Maybe... It does make it easier to be a shit tank, but harder for the healer
---
Currently some of the top Alliance AV premades are getting 18k an hour farming AV with instant queues. I highly doubt any Horde is getting anywhere close to 15k honor an hour. I'd eat my words if you showed me proof for 15k an hour with 17 minute long AV queues.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/524390574?t=17h30m28s
---
&lt;APES&gt; GM sitting at 18k honor per hour.
---
Imagine thinking ACLG aren't insanely good even for tanks.
---
More unbridled wrath procs would be my guess
---
You telling people to tank in leather just so they can use daggers?
---
Hope you have a power ranger one ready for T3!
---
1. Make sure the videos you are watching are of classic and not a private server. Classic mobs often have much more HP than private server mobs do so the videos are not realistic. 
---
2. In ZF, aoe earlier rather than later. You want blizzard to start when all the mobs are still frozen in frost nova. In videos people show themselves throwing a blizz down and all the mobs instantly slow down when they enter range, but in real gaming they often will run through 90% of the blizzard before they slow.
---
Congrats! I kept mine for YEARS. Then my account got hacked :(
---
What does cleave do while sweeping strike is up?  Does it just double the cleave so there's 4 strikes?
---
We're attempting Rag tonight with 21, and 5 of those are alts. Wish us luck.
---
Yeah it's interesting. I wasn't attacking your stance on the subject, just genuinely curious as I'm not sure myself. It just seems to be one of those ideas that is perpetuated without really knowing why, and it sounds like it should make sense upon first glance.
---
Hope they delay it as long as possible. Things are good now.
---
I tanked DM: North at level 57 with just about the same amount of HP/Armor. You’ll be ok if you’re skilled.
---
Same thing with my guild with our pallies as well.
---
They’ll be longer once more people learn how to premade, don’t worry your shiny head 😁
---
How much did PoD cost? I've never seen one on AH.
---
Also that moment when you WF a rogue for 1.4k, only to get death rayed for 2k, shows what's the realm MVP here is.
---
* You farm consumables twice as hard compared to other melee counterparts: mana pots, demonic runes and so on
---
* You have 3 resources to watch for: mana, energy and combo points. Your rotation is significantly more complicated than rogues' or warriors'
---
* Your bags are occupied by different sets of gear: pve, pvp, fire resist, heal offspec, tanking gear, add nature and frost res with future phases.
---
* There are only 2-3 items you might need in MC: Accuria, Wrists, and cpe from Ragna. In MC there are like 2-3 feral items, and 2 are highly contested (DFT and Nef's neck).
---
* As a deep feral u are garbage in PvP (especially against geared opponents)
---
* Even if you try hard, you get 70% dps of a similarly skilled warrior and rogue. 
---
Just play resto or resto-balance instead.
---
Yeah 5/8 T1 1/2 T2 and i dont wear any off it unless im annoying guildies with lol moonfire spam.  or healing 5 mans
---
Pugs have cleared mc...  not being able to kill rag makes it a shit guild

Got multiple guild members online at different hours, also pictures of some of these players just being afk in mutiple bgs and moving like a bot, casting random spells in random areas, I just want to post that stuff to a GM, was just curious if there was any blue post about them wanting to do anything at all. This is already a known issue not just one random guy talking about bots, it's annoying to spend all this time ranking up just to have some guy that uses a bot or shares accounts to get in front.
---
Yah I really feel like people don't understand that's it's all relative to your own server faction. I see a lot of misinformation on the subreddit about this.
---
I mean, they locked it to FFA now, not much effort to lock it to group loot with a specific rarity.
---
I wanted to explain one of the best methods for making gold multi-boxing. (and it's excellent for gold-making with a team of real players as well) The method is unfortunately Horde only, but I figured it was still worth sharing.
---
You can repeat the "**What's Going On**" quest an infinite number of times and this will send a wave of enemies into the prison cell where the quest begins.
---
1. The quest chain starts with "**Disharmony of Flame**" given by **Thunderheart** (the roaming Kargath NPC) and you need to be level 48 to start the quest.
---
2. After you kill **Overmaster Pyron** (next to the BRD entrance) and travel back to Kargath you have to talk to **Galamav the Marksman** (at the top of the Kargath watchtower) who will give you the quest "**Commander Gor'shak**"
---
3. Now you just travel into BRD and acquire the **Prison Cell Key** from **High Interrogator Gerstahn** (she's very close by the entrance)
---
4. Enter the Prison Cell and talk to **Commander Gor'shak** and turn in the **Commander Gor'shak** quest
---
5. At this point you are going to obtain and remove the quest "**What's Going On**" from your log over and over - I use a macro for this: "**/script SetAbandonQuest(); /script AbandonQuest(); /target Commander**" (add a line break before each slash) - I am extremely careful to remove the quest from my logs immediately after I start the quest and I ONLY target Gor'shak with my "**Interact With Target**" hotkey to avoid accidentally turning in the quest
---
This method will result in an enormous amount of raw gold, grey items, **Runecloth**, **Relic Coffer Keys**, **Librams of Constitution/Voracity** and epics. I've gotten 20K+ Runecloth, 30+ Librams of Constitution, multiple **Edgemaster's Handguards** and various other epics. 
---
This is absolutely one of the best methods for obtaining gold and experience in Classic WoW and I highly recommend that people try it out.
---
\- Jerome
---
I just want to complete the wildwheart set because I'm into fashion.
---
First, you should immediately get that 6% hit since you already have the human racial of 305 weapon skill which makes a huge difference (I'd get 2 tarnished elvin rings) then drop your might bracers for battleborn for that last 1% hit. Don't feel like you have to wear 8/8 might, the set bonus is garbage since you should never rely on sundering alone for threat, there's much better individual pieces like eldritch reinforced legplates from DMW that you can throw in to optimize your threat gain.
---
With dual-wield tanking, which we refer to as fury-prot you basically want to maximize the amount of crit in your build with some mitigation. I'm a MT and I usually roll with 22% crit , 330def with like 4700hp unbuffed and I think OH Mirah's Song would work fine for you; it's all about finding that right balance which works for your raid. You should watch this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0HrEklWjI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0HrEklWjI) , and for his talent tree I would take 2-3 points out of sunder strike and put into heroic strike since you always have that up on boss fights.
---
Happened to me in AV at relief hut. I thought I'd defended the flag and the cast finished but alliance capped at the exact same time.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/object=177226/book-soothsaying-for-dummies](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=177226/book-soothsaying-for-dummies) . A comment on that page explains the process/where to find the book.
---
You can solo the arena bosses
---
I hit 60, remembered I didn’t have a schedule that’s conducive for raiding, and started 2 alts. The leveling journey is a game on it’s own, so that’s where I’ll be.
---
he'd make a GREAT leader for no-nonsense minded people.
---
Sunder doesn't replace your autoattack. And autoattack can still crit. And autoattack crits generate a huge amount of rage. So unless you have infinite rage - sunder is better. And if you DO have infinite rage - you spam both sunder and heroic and don't need to choose.
---
We disenchant so many fucking druid pieces.
---
That belt isn't even supposed to be in the game until like the Naxx patch.
---
Lmao embarrassing
---
Haha that shit made me laugh! I'm on my way to meet a girl for a date and she asked me that exact question. I might just show her this! Wish me well!
---
Hello Mr.Smart, im 2 weeks away from r10 on my main. Now go away.
---
I literally did a /tar jed in the corner and got the ID earlier this week.
---
Moron lol
---
It varies, but it isn't much higher than MC as a previous poster noted. As for proof and such, the values has been calculated and discussed A LOT without much consensus, the brady guide bestiary listed 4691 for most AQ bosses, but damage done to them and old footage suggests much lower values, around 3500-4000. Kel'Thuzad has been estimated to 3000, even less than Ragnaros, suggesting some bosses has more caster like armor.
---
I think a healthy number is around 4000-4500 if you wanna calculate, in a few cases, that is gonna be false and bosses will have slightly less. Rarely will they have much more.
---
We have 3 druids in our 40man, we're all at least 6/8 T1 and I'm the only one without both available T2 pieces, I'm missing the legs. This is after 2 months, if even that long. Druids have it so easy.
---
Dropping a rank will get you better healing per mana but lower output. I have 4 rejuvs on my bar but mostly use max rank tbh. Downranking jubs can be good for long Onys, and will prolly be useful for some of the fights to come.
---
its rly hard 2 buy it on my server atm, never saw offer whit it.
---
Hey, are you from the Warlizard gaming forum?
---
Not really. Keeping threat on dungeon bosses is easy. Large packs of mobs are the problem. So for tanking dungeons the most useful talent is Sweeping strikes in Arms.
---
Wait why are you going to the bg entrance in alterac?
---
So I tested this out Alliance side today. 90 minute match with an Alliance win with galv rep also. We had all 3 aerial turn in masters summoned and druids summoned. Came out to 1500 rep (plus bonus 250 honorable kills). Granted, these type of matches are extreme outliers and happen rarely.
---
Best I've come up with is looking forward to bwl there is a lot of highly controversial loot. Is there a way they could make the loot council system more transparent in preparation for that? Try to word it like you're worried about long term guild health in the future, not about current suspicions. That might make it appear a little less instigating. Best I got for you bud, good luck.
---
when will you make more youtube vids fam
---
feelsbadman
---
Playing warsong last night.
---
Running down the tunnel at full health, bear form charge a warrior, swap to cheetah and start running,
---
Dead.
---
100%ed, and I have more than 5k health in cheetah. One Melee, and had SS/Hoj/WF/SS all proc continuously to end it.
---
We lost that warsong.
---
&gt; So instead only a couple people should be eligible
---
Yeah, exactly.  The people that actually contributed to the kill.  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Not the dude afk at the graveyard.
---
I needed a hearty chuckle
---
As a fury warrior main, I love having a feral Druid in my group for the added crit. Also, super easy to get into groups because you can tank or dps as long as you have the gear for 5-mans on my server at least where everyone needs a tank. I have also heard rumblings of using a bear tank on ony to help with P2-&gt;P3 threat transition being better. But in all, I would say they do less damage than other melee and don’t have much gear to obtain in raids
---
I think it's splitting hairs over one rank.
---
Also, reference gear as supporting examples that are not for your class. This will help you in not appearing to have ulterior motives.
---
well if denying reality is funny to you thats fine
---
This is painfully accurate.
---
So what's stopping a couple lowbies from suiciding into an enemy raid for Dk?
---
Melee is alot more dependant on gear for damage during levelling imo. Gotta stay on it, especially weapons.
---
They can stick to daggers.
---
Nasty gimmick, sounds super fun though
---
I'm doing this on a 57 pally with an 11/21/16 build and  can do each lasher group with out bubble or bandage ending on about 20% health and mana, I have about 330 defence. Only notable gear is Nagel ring, mark of the chosen, uthers strength, green tower and thrash blade. I also kill 1 or 2 of the stealth demons right before hydro. I can make 10 gold a run if I'm lucky and lots of low herbs I mail to alchemy alt and greens I DE.
---
Don't raid with them anymore,  rerolled for better wsg queues.  The problem could have been with the competency of the previous full prot MT, but he was historically a relatively decent player.
---
So you have time to dump hundreds of hours into an alt to get blue PvP gear but you don't have time for a 2 hour MC run?
---
&gt;Hello Mr.Smart
---
Man I wish I played on NA. 
---
EU alliance are garbage tier
---
The most important healing talent imo is Imp. Healing Touch. I'd grab 3/3 Reflection too. If you have those two and like 4k+ mana you should be fine. A full healing spec will make things a good deal easier though, to be fair.
---
They got a great thing going on, in that discord, but the guy who runs it is a real drama queen. He loves the drama, and he feigns that he hates it but Alex loves being the center of attention. He's a toddler and it's sad.
---
Depends on your server.  There's no clear answer.  If you have honor spy aim for bracket of your goal rank +1.  So since you want 8, try to maintain at least bracket 9.  You should get a couple ranks a week early, and 1 a week for the last few.  Anyone giving an answer with the limited information given is either speculating or memeing.
---
Grats man! I have it on my mage, and I use it for when I'm diving into the enemy team for the extra shield. Don't forget the fact that it has pvp use for the shield alone!
---
I like how we both just walked away too haha
---
Well I might be biased cause as a premade we don't lose often and if so it's usually cause we wanna lose to make the game end faster.
---
Rep doesn't matter at this point for most people, so winning or losing is just some additional bonus honor. As long as the games are quick, it really doesn't matter for us. 
---
I saw a couple of Russian horde premades win the game within 6 minutes so it's definitely possible. Probably you gotta pull Vann right away and offtank the guards (unless you guys can pull him like we pull Drek - with just 1 guard?) so some good coordination is required.
---
Most of the time alliance doesn't defend or it's some 1 random roleplayer defending while handing in quests, so it's really just killing npcs quickly.
---
However, from my experience horde prefers to do random stuff like fighting at alliance gy or in the middle and only has a handful of people attacking. Therefore it's just faster for us to end the game after we are done with other objectives and got full bonus honor (except for towers for which you gotta wait).
---
pls
---
Yes you can. It's easier to learn than tribute runs. Doing the last boss can be tricky because he has a nasty dot when in demon form but the rest is fairly easy. You can check 3 book locations, pick up a handful of dreamfoil and gromsblood in the garden where you jump, you come across 3 or 4 different ghost mushrooms spawn locations (you usually get 1 per run, not all of them spawn at once), and obviously you get the rich thorium veins in the end. You only kill one boss though, so you get 1 blue or green item per run.   
---
If you don't have mining DM E are not worth it, if you have both mining and herbalism it seems to be decent but I think tribute run with engineering are still more money.
---
If you want to *actually* dps and have that dps be meaningful, neither dude. Sorry, it sucks, the only way around it is in mass cleave fights and specifically with bonereaver's edge, and even that isn't that great without windfury.
---
Judgement helm is one of the best looking items in video game history.
---
Nah probably just casual.
---
Considering people will probably start transferring off mega servers I find it hard to believe 90% of the servers will die, even if people quit. People will also continue to play alts. 90% server death more or less equates to 90% sub loss...which is extreme. 50, probably, 70 maybe but 90, no way. That's 9 out of 10 people...
---
It's even harder to believe considering the Reddit sub count continues to increase fairly nicely
---
Being immune to any cc that breaks on damage while you have sac on a few people is just another OP part of being a pally
---
#clickbait title
---
Say multi-boxing gold farm method in your title.
---
This isn't a conversation about which gauntlets are better lol
---
Subuscrubudu! ;)
---
Except with not that much of a distance.
---
As a feral druid I am loving my BiS healing set. :D
---
Luna unit frames my man!
---
Why do you party with another dps caster? Arena + angerforge is easy 3man. Only problem might be healer taking the belt.
---
IF you aren't bullshitting with "saw lots of people do this on stream/youtube" then I would guess Blizzard fixed it as it was never intended for people to be able to loot the chest if they were not on the kill. It's not supposed to be like DMN chest.
---
The bugging out of chest wouldn't be exactly new to domo as the chest have had numerous bugs in the past as well.
---
I'm gonna go with the theory they tried to prevent the FFA method and through that introduced the bug you experienced when doing so.
---
If you have the ability to no life the game and actually gear your character optimally, warriors are the way to go. Rogues are a lot easier to get to the point of being competitive though. If you're willing to put the work/time/research in you will love warrior.
---
It's pretty good pvp gear
---
It's the best kept Horde secret for XP/goldfarming for non-multiboxers as well - it's just a lot better when you get to keep all the gold yourself. I did this method before I started multiboxing and I still ended up with 2 Hurricanes, 1 Edgemaster's Handguards and a bunch of Runecloth/Pumpkin Bags. (during the Halloween event)
---
On my server they cost over 2000
---
Kromcrush Horde has 20 min queues at peak time.
---
Benediction Alliance is instant, sometimes a 2 min queue for WSG.
---
Not going daggers smh
---
Naw it’s just [tea with sugar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15723/tea-with-sugar)
---
I'm so confused why people care so much for "content". Yes a lot of people who want to do boring raids will play until the content stops being released, but honestly, Private Servers have been alive FOR YEARS without new content. 
---
I expect many people to stick around and just play the damn game.
---
I'm getting a similar crash today - turns out Windows Defender is flagging Warden as a threat under:
---
Win32/DefenseEvasion.P!ml
---
Keeps blocking it, gotta figure out how to exclude it from the results.
---
dude I have watched every one of these since release and they just keep getting weirder haha
---
Hunters are great for raids, weaving attacks through auto-attacks, managing threat with FD when other classes get told “no dps let the tank get aggro” just to get a few extra points on the meters, pulling to your favorite tank, hanging out on hunter island with the cool kids for rag.  It’s a fun class to raid with.
---
It's also going to only get worse from here on out.
---
There will always be 100-500 people farming 200k-600k+ honor each week.
---
At the moment if you're the 501st person you are 501 of say 6000 people. You are in the top 8% (501/6000~= 0.0835) of the bracket system.
---
In a few weeks when the casual novelty of the battleground system wears off. There might only be 3000 people playing. Being 501 of 3000 leaves you at the top 16%.
---
Not exactly sure what the distribution of the ranks is. [But apparently rank 11 is 1% of the players and rank 14 0.1%.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview) Let's be generous and say rank 11-14 is around 5% of players. If you're in the top 8% of the grind then you might not even make rank 10. If the player base halves then you're nowhere near.
---
The new meta is going to be creating low level wsg alts that can get 15 hks each week to pad out the brackets. Since you can make 10 characters per realm. Then if everybody did that then you could guarantee your main makes top 10% of players with 15 hks.
---
Its important to remember that losses are not a bad thing.  In fact, losing is one of the best ways to learn and improve your skills.  This post is a testament to that.
---
Nah that's flasks. Elixirs are like those weird pre-workout protein shakes.
---
I am one of those that goes back to the keep after balinda and enjoy myself snowballing our warlords into the zerg when they try to side pull drek and ends up wiping their zerg. And supposed "turtle" is only like 10-15 on D while the rest are up north giving us the win in most of my games.
---
9/10 people would probably bet it’s gonna be the nerfed version.
---
Joining a BG together is cheating but using a terrain exploit isnt. Big brain?
---
I did that in retail vanilla switching it up this time
---
Swords is fuckin dope gtfo
---
This is the same guy who cried that multiboxing is going to "destroy Classic WoW and there's nothing we can do about it"
---
he's all about clickbait
---
&gt;do you have to raid?
---
If you really want to be a wrecking ball right now you really want to have a BRE, a Spinal, or a Sulfuras, until R14 weapons start to be out.
---
I honestly feel bad for Warriors and the high priority crafted and boe gear. As a Shaman, I just chug consumables like a lifetime alcoholic. But that's nowhere near the thousands of gold in Arcane Crystals, Cloudkeepers, Edgemasters, Librams (omg the cost of Voracity compared to Focus), Enchants. And on top of all that they suck at farming!
---
Tier gear isn't horrible for mitigation tanking. It's got a lot of Stam and armor on it.
---
"150-200g per hour"
---
.....if you multibox 10 accounts.
---
Extremely misleading clickbait title.
---
Pride in Turtling. Now there's something you don't often see people bragging about.
---
Because you're in a raid lol, who takes an aoe frost spec to a raid?
---
Alliance wants fast games, cos we get instant queue while horde has to wait a lot to get in. Naturally they want to make the most out of it, while for us, it simply doesn't matter.
---
Chiggidity Chad the bads get the mad
---
Thats not the same as gkicking someone is it.
---
We barely have 2 Druids for our Splitraids, its just a shitty Class that isn't great at anything thats why nobody plays it.
---
Well I got obliterated by facts and logic.
---
lol
---
"good coke makes you poop" wonder if he was serious cause thats bad coke cut with baby laxatives.
---
My guilds casual, we down rag first phase.
---
That's ridiculous though.  The skillcap required to be *close* to what people can do facerolling their keyboard just makes it a terrible class.
---
No bindings, one hand of rag, 2 full t1 shamans almost 4.
---
That was actually horrible
---
I love it
---
I found the method to be interesting enough to share for solo players - it's the best way to level and (one of) the best ways to farm gold as a solo player as well. It's one of the last "infinitely repeating quests" that Blizzard has left in the game and I don't think enough people know about it.
---
People have so many god damn overwatch accounts its not even funny I swear everyone who bought the game has at least 3 copies.
---
I got an Ele set as well as heals. It's fun dropping people in 2 spells
---
I understand that you want to bring av inline with wsg honor but that would kill av. It would be completely unplayable because you wouldn't get enough players to even start it. AV has to have an advantage inorder to get people to queue for it. If a match of wsg and av both gave the same honor you would do wsg every time because it would take less time to find a group to do it which would make it net more honor.
---
If you remove the perk for joining the one with a higher barrier of entry then people will not do it.
---
Way better for each to solo. You can get some gear and do jump runs, he can solo ZF graves.
---
Mechanics mechanics mechanics. like almost every boss fight in vanilla if you can deal with the mechanics the boss will die. Vael needs dps, but if everyone is the correct spec and actually on target you'll kill it fast enough. If your dps is low you may need a couple healers with MP5 sets for chromaggus just to dispell/decurse. other than that it's all a cakewalk assuming you know and execute the strategy correctly.
---
Priiiiiest. I have an absolute blast. Always easy to find groups for dungeons. Fairly quick to level when soloing as well. Switch to shadow and PVP is great. Mind control enemies and drown them for fun.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Don’t even trip, my guild is relatively casual and most of us are having fun leveling alts. I’ve got a 16 hunter, gonna be awhile
---
It's easy to find a guild later on, and if anything its easy to gear up as you'll be speed runned through MC because the guilds needs people for BWL
---
Unfortunately, they still do, which is 80% a lose for the alliance. Only time alliance wins if they do the same like horde: Destroy towers, Defend own towers and slowly progress.
---
Moonkin here and even I have 5/8 T1 and 1 T2 taking that stuff last
---
Dead wrong, on the most competetive servers with the hardest possible rank, the mass majority of people in the top bracket are livestreaming it and interacting with chat along the way...
---
who cares if it's even possible (it is), it's a massive waste of time wearing THAT much armor for dungeon spams.  I used to spam dungeons as a tank with 7800 self buffed armor, replacing nonsense like warden staff and armor rings/trinkets for more threat and damage oriented pieces.  Of course the threat is drastically more important if you're running with competent dps, but if packs are taking twice as long to kill with rando pugs you might want to gear a few more pieces towards defense.
---
this set is probably the most mitigation I'd run a dungeon with: [https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/kvYxJKYe6jAFJmh47h8C3L](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/kvYxJKYe6jAFJmh47h8C3L) I've tanked literally hundreds of runs with that setup or worse.
---
"There's no "tipping point" gearwise to go furyprot. It's not a level up mechanic. It's something you do when your DPS are pulling 850 plus, and you're starting to lose aggro despite itemizing correctly and playing well. If you don't fit that criteria, you should stay as far away from it as you can or you'll just be hampering your guild"
---
 -Fight Club Discord
---
No that's not the same.
---
I wouldn't gkick someone just because he doesn't put in the effort to raid.
---
I would, however, put him on whatever rank doesn't get first pick on loot. Something like "social" aka you are welcome to raid with us but you're only getting unwanted gear. Meanwhile I'd look for a replacement.
---
The thing I would absolutely gkick someone over is creating drama.
---
stealth with mining is really good. It is true there's herbs that benefit rogues and lucky those items can be made from cooking and poisons so you might want to learn cooking also. Mining and Herbalism aren't production professions but they can be good for making gold. Engineering makes useful items for pvp and requires many of the ores and stones found in Mining.
---
Soo the best method is paying $120-150/mo to blizzard.  Got it.
---
AV is a low key sick runecloth farm. If you just go round looting elites and bowmen etc, you can easily come out with a stack or two of runecloth each game as you clear the objectives.
---
If I knew this from the start of AV farming I'd probably be halfway to exalted with darnassus by now lol.
---
Congrats, I'm last in line for Lawbringer as its offspec for me.
---
Pretty much yes
---
For sure, but a druid can heal/offtank/dps, they can decurse/remove poisons, they can innervate, and they can battle rez. A good druid can do all of these things competently in a single spec. They fill the gaps of what the raid needs from fight to fight. They're not necessarily useful in mc, but their ability to adapt to the needs of the raid for each fight makes them unparalleled in their value for a progression guild.
---
That's funny because from our perspective we dont have healers in AV. I think only the other faction has healers, as a general rule.
---
Bumperino 4 pvperino
---
The "clickbait" is that you're conveniently NOT mentioning in the title that you're multiboxing 10 accounts. That's kind of a huge detail to leave out.
---
I can't see u getting very far in aq40, if you can't do bwl.
---
When I roll wsg premade its druid fc, 2 wars 2 pallys, if one pally is ret I'll grab a priest then just fill with at least 1or 2 rouges then mages and locks and 1 hunter.  Wars tend to carry hard with 2 pallies keeping them mobile and ms on efc.
---
Currently 24-4 in wsg premades
---
Geez that’s disappointing to hear, we kill him with a minute left on submerge with no world buffs or flasks... if BWL is as much of a cakewalk as MC I can’t see a lot of my guild playing anymore.
---
Imagine making a class that is meant to be played in four different way but only make a set for one
---
I'd  love to test out some of those methods - ZF multibox with 10 accounts in multiple instances would be insane, but I'm not very good at the game so I'm not sure how that would go. I've heard a lot about Eye of Shadow farming and it's definitely high on the list of things to test for me.
---
yes definitely but not **needed** my friend
---
Warrior. Classic needs more tanks.
---
Tons of horde fight for SF when Ally have no southern gy. They want us to all spawn in base and turtle another 20min. Sometimes, I fight to keep SF all game incase we lose fwgy. When offense fails, I don't want a full 40 man turtle on the bridge. When we do all spawn in base, #1 goal is to take SF and Tell alliance to run south to regroup at fwgy. Yet, 95% of alliance have fun turtling their hearts out.
---
The problems with capping SH is that the smart Alliance won't re-cap it, ruining the whole advantage you get from not capping it in another situation.
---
Yeah...when I was typing it I was trying to figure out what to call resistance and ...school resistance?  Might be better.
---
I don’t have one but I should get that figured out.
---
Stats can vary from fight to fight cause I swap gear depending on the roll I’m playing.
---
But generally, unbuffed in bear
---
11200 armor
---
6500 HP
---
15% dodge
---
22% crit
---
650AP
---
I'm... Going to try this method you describe when I play later today. For science.
---
I am I hunter so it should be cake.
---
You have 65% chance of seeing it in 20 runs. You should only need 4-8 hours with average luck. 50+ runs is really really fucking bad luck that only 7 people out of 100 will have.
---
called a joke...
---
i dont understand how a person sits through this ADHD shit. you dont need to edit literally every second of a 10 minute video
---
Not much of an “assassin” with big ass swords
---
Let's be serious does anyone here think BWL won't be defeated within 3 hours of launch?
---
It's mentioned in the title - 5x2 means 2 sets of 5 accounts. My apologies for not being more clear - I'd love to edit the title but it doesn't seem possible.
---
Dude sixty upgrades is an insanely useful tool, I highly recommend. That's some spicy stats dude, good for you.
---
Lmao def not. Faerlina is probably the most competitive server, and the streamers definitely don't have the highest honor. 
---
The people at the top of the honor bracket are doing questionable things, from account sharing to getting disability checks. Even streamers don't play 18 hours a day everyday
---
Blessing of Sacrifice has about 1 min cd and lasts 30 seconds. Get your facts straight
---
Wtf is this
---
Dont be salty... this dude playing 18 hours a day playing wow. Lol
---
Because back then the BG was supposed to be almost unwinnable for either side and just a permanent meatgrinder. It was constructed more like an extra zone than a battleground. Then they kept nerfing NPC's and taking NPC's and other stuff out until it became a rush BG.
---
Man why u gotta make a video about it ffs
---
I cant tell what is happening in the video. Can you explain further?
---
Can you post one of the YouTube videos you’re talking about?
---
How casual do you think casual is? My guild also does 1.5hr clears but I would not say we're casual.
---
you lost me at "most dumbest"
---
The most competetive server would hands down be Gehennas, and pretty much all of APES are streaming their rank and they're also dominating the top bracket. Same goes with the top bracket on horde too, with players from eheroes and others like lmgd also streaming. If any decent parent can sleep for 3-4 hours a night, taking care of a newborn kid and still go to work normally, you can bet your life on the fact that some turbonerds can sleep for 6-7 hours a night and play for 16+ hrs...
---
not only dishonest, but this guy is mentally unstable too
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissDreamyWallabyGrammarKing
---
He doesn’t sound like Mr. Smart
---
Damn your other Heals must suck ass if you top HPS.
---
WEEK on Nef? Commmmeeee on it is not just PS guilds. You act like former players forgot BWL
---
high stam is only necessary really for dog packs in dm east. theyre shit gold anyway. int is where it's at. You can do a lot with one more blizzard. remember your +spell damage scales horribly with aoe spells. buy some cheap mana pots and health pots too while you're learning. they're a nice crutch but try not to use them every pull.
---
you SHOULD be using your mana gem every pull though.
---
if you're getting wrecked start by pulling 4-5 mobs at once. zf graves is the easiest place as the mobs dont resist much and have no ranged attacks/fears. I leveled 35-60 primarily aoe grinding in the world and then ran a set of 4 characters up to about 50 so (planned to multibox) via aoe grinding. I wasn't able to get my head around BRD farming (not efficiently anyway) but some people make it work. it seems a lot less common. 
---
don't try to do the pulls like in the videos. I did graves in 3 pulls and probably should have done less, I died on the 2nd pull a lot (the big one in the middle) and could have probably saved time.
---
as for your spec, as long as you have some spec listed in one of the videos they all pretty much work, it's just about the way you want to play. I used [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005001--05350233132351301) because I wanted something that had shatter as well.
---
I've been playing the game for 15 years and that is never how it's worked for me. I lose rolls, period. It's why I love DKP... I put effort in I get loot out, got real tired of fresh new raid members coming in and winning everything before suddenly having no time to raid and then being replaced by someone else to win all the rolls.
---
Should roll pally then, peak performance is a right click.
---
You can as alliance, skip all towers, graveyards, and even the warmasters in Drek's room. Allowing this "exploit" to form. When you can skip everything to the end boss, that's pretty much a cheat.
---
Try /cast instead of /use and see if that fixes it.
---
Otherwise, you might have to be specific and use /cancelaura.
---
    /cancelaura [stance:1]Bear Form;[stance:2]Aquatic Form;[stance:3]Cat Form;[stance:4]Travel Form
---
That uses up more room of course. It also assumes you have all your forms.
---
It’s the dragon rend rides in Ubrs
---
I've gotten really annoyed at first but then I realized that you not only showed a helpful tutorial but at the same time memed hard af by fulfilling every 2004-2006 wow video stereotype.
---
Edit: However after rewatching I did notice a few mistakes.
---
1. your Video is not in 240p not even in 480p but in full HD.
---
2. You missed the several "!" after subscribe
---
3. You did not mistype while writing at least 2-3 times and then backspace to correct the word you mistyped
---
NA wow competitive OMEGALUL
---
Yeah I dont see the bug at all looks like the standard 11 min Derek kill. Tanking him in the right spot and everything.
---
I have the luxury of spamming rejuvenation on multiple tanks to pad my numbers. But the point is, you saying they're dog shit at everything is both wrong and stupid.
---
This is true but he said they all rolled need so if that was the agreement then...
---
This whole time Ive been using my face. Now I know why Im bad. Thanks stranger.
---
Looks like an Easter egg devs put in to troll dataminers or perhaps just for internal testing. That's what the you wish bit implies anyway.
---
Theres a whole bunch of legendary stuff in the code of vanilla that wasnt actually in the playable game itself, it's probably something like that.
---
Well the average guild only really has 2 raid nights per week
---
That's EU tho. I'm talking about freedomland
---
It’s a different color
---
Stalagg had a 1.7 million honor cap last week
---
Yes sir
---
Classic WoW competitive OMEGALUL. Competitive in this context only means the server with the highest honor cap
---
No your method is actually higher level. If you play with your face you can jerk off with both hands.
---
This isn't an exploit, you can rewind the VOD to see how he pulls. It's just bad design of AV: alliance can ranged pull drek solo
---
pulling drek w/o warmasters is intended?
---
Found the American :)
---
Maybe it's because they're PVE players who haven't done a lot of PVP because they're not on PVP servers.   
---
Maybe
---
its because PvE players don't play PVP much and the PvE experience lets you just kinda run on auto pilot, so they are probably trying to play PVP like its PvE
---
I just want a suggestions and like how they play later on like dude I’m new to this
---
Yeah it's way faster than killing him after.... still confused, does horde not kill vann this way?
---
"something something horde bias"
---
?? XD
---
The best part is that you don’t really have control over it. Rnjesus works in mysterious ways.
---
Beginner to Wow in general, I'm considering creating an alt so I can play the game without leveling past where my friends are on my main account. The only other MMO I've played is FF14 and in that game DPS class queues are very long at the times I'm typically playing the game, is this a problem in Classic WoW as well, and if so, is it a big enough problem that I should be considering creating another healer character (probably a different class however).  
---
And a second question, I'm leveling Priest as my main character right now and I'm confused on leveling. Apparently holy (w/e the heal spec is called) is really slow at leveling and Shadow priest is the way to go, but if I go shadow priest am I still able to heal in group content? I am levelling with my friends, a tank and a DPS, but I wont be levelling with them all the time.
---
Except of course that every peice of +block chance / value and the set bonus is useless. 
---
Mitigation gear vs threat gear. Fury prot uses pretty exclusively threat gear.
---
Herb alch is a safe play. Being able to make your own potions is super handy for pve and then you can farm your own swift thistle for thistle rea (made by cooking like lvl 70)
---
Herbs are relevant all game and a lot of the mid range ones become very valuable late game.
---
My plan is to try it out and see. Sucks alot more to need them and not have them than to have them and not need them.
---
Dozens of guilds have their own private servers practicing BWL right now. The first guilds to clear will be the ones with the earliest raid times.
---
You look like a clone of all the other 1000 rogue with their t1/t2 set. Nothing special here.
---
Mining and engi
---
So ? I’m happy I got my set took a nice screen shot where’s your gear at ?
---
I mean jed patrols a large area. Not only 2 days ago did I fish for Jed at the door entrance.
---
You arent going to lose/win an av with ~5 people being afk. Also most of the time i notice people bitch about others being afk in the cave, such as yourself, its actually the defenders waiting to respawn.
---
Takes a hunter feign death or a vanish, it also takes a mere handful non-tarded horde to defend this.  hurrdurr stunlock the tank, don't kill the minimal amount of squishy healers or dps.
---
That’s what y’all get for abusing the awesome power. We’re doing just fine on horde watching Netflix and Disney+ for 15 minutes and then turtling for 45. Zug zug.
---
Totally meant that. Haha yep. C ya around... \*spam stealth\*
---
private servers especially died every 2-3 years, generally soon after naxx was released. especially on pvp servers, most of the fun is in the early phases when everyone is leveling and no one has any gear. naxx gear also kinda breaks a lot of classes because of how overpowered it is. i don't expect classic to die at all, but i doubt any server will last more than 1 year post naxx. unless blizzard is insane enough to not create new cycles, then there's simply no other place to go. 
---
i don't quite understand what you mean by just playing the game though. what else is there to do than leveling, getting professions up and farming dungeons/raids? once you're done with everything you re-roll or take a break, what else is there to do? even in bc with arena i'd want a fresh server eventually because season 4 forever would be incredibly tedious. those old expansions, to me, are like old games i play through once in a while and then i move on until i'm up for it again, simply because they're finite. and i personally have no problem with that, it's actually why i look forward to it because i know it's gonna be a blast and there won't be a shitty patch eventually.
---
DH has literally every tool you could ever want. Nothing like it in classic.
---
Alliance are crap heads. It's because half of them are paladins. Who would willingly choose the faction with pink warriors in dresses? You get what you deserve!
---
But that requires killing or tanking mobs doesn't it ?
---
Every FRESH killed the previous private server because people become hungry for content and character progression, classic wont have a long-life span of 2-3+years for the same reason every server died when the next FRESH was released.
---
No.
---
Not here to compete with anyone I love the game and happy to get my gear don’t gotta try to suck the fun out of it
---
Yo wotlk cant wait.
---
I saw you on flamelash before the whole migration debacle happend, on which server are you playing now?
---
Now do it with recklessness.  Record this 200 times.  Release pvp video.
---
It's impossible to pull Vann without pulling adds I believe
---
A knight to remember
---
oh my bad, you are correct. for a moment i thought this was a video of the alterac valley anniversary event in live. good catch my dude, have an upvote
---
Only 600k? The top bracket on my server is at 1.1m
---
The bed is made. If you're playin classic ain't nobody got time for that!
---
You people that act like one faction is somehow superior are the shittiest / sweatiest fanboys.
---
Yea is a pretty nice farm so far. I need to mess with my spec a bit so i can both raid and farm without respec costs
---
It won’t let you. There aren’t faction transfers on classic
---
This is exactly what I needed in my life. Keep this shit coming man.
---
The sound editing in this is 10/10
---
As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after watching competitive esports for a few years I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free
---
I love it for pvp as a feral. Sometimes I go full cat gear too depending.
---
And then crushing that set with dungeon blues
---
Lol really??? I don’t see the point ina all that
---
Not at all, Razorgore is easy as long as your melee aren't sleeping or keyboard turning. 2 Minute Rag is basically enough dps for all the fights in BWL, they're more mechanic checks than dps. Even Vael is a laughable dpscheck, it's more about how much TPS your tanks can push.
---
I enjoy WSG because I feel that my actions actually make a difference to the outcome of the game. In AV I feel the opposite. Then again I’m just a warlock
---
Same. But the majority of players are much lower. Last time I checked honor spy we had 3-4 going crazy in the rank 14 bracket, and then brackets 13 to 9 ranged from 200 to 600k
---
 On our server the premades are farming 21k/hour on average. Sometimes more on a good streak, sometimes less, but this is the combined total over a few days of playtime. The bracket 1 dudes in my server are insane and pushing 1.5 million honor, which is close to the highest honor i've seen across all servers(1.7?).
---
Point being, 1500/21 = 71 hours, just over 10 hours daily. I really don't see where people get the 16 hour/day figure from. You'd see people with 2 million + honor if they were doing premades 16 hours per day. Which makes sense to me, people would start dying pretty quickly at 16 hours/day pace.
---
And that's considering you don't even need the top bracket for rank 14. Going at bracket 2 all the way is totally fine, you just need to reach bracket 1 once close to the very end.
---
Horde meta is more interesting and rewards personal skill more, since the fastest way to farm honor on horde isn't to stay with a blob, but to farm solo kills in AV(which means 1v1s and 1vXs, yay). Which alliance can also do, but without joining a premade your honor per hour will tank, and a premade will kick you pretty quick if you start doing that.
---
What i'm saying is that I certainly don't see 16 hours/day for bracket 1. I'm not dedicated enough to play AV more than 5 to 8 hours daily, which only puts me in bracket 3, but that's enough for me.
---
You sound just like my dad.
---
If you have a solid gold farming method it’s usually better to farm out the gold then buy it vs farming for the item. Not just with eye of shadow either
---
That post must be a troll,  because grizz has AH and ranking brackets completely cornered on stalagg. They have no reason to give up that advantage. It is killing Stalagg however because a bunch of ally guilds are xferring off since they can't compete with grizzly. Means Stalagg is going the way of flamelash ultimately..
---
Try half that. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was cleared within 1 hr of the raid being attuned. So 1.5 hrs from launch if lag isnt an issue.
---
They won’t shoot past the flag
---
Well that’s not true at all. It does already exists in the game.
---
Set everyone to ignore loot and set it to uncommon or rares and above. This is basically FFA without giving out all high level drops.
---
Also, the whole “this would require coding” argument does not exactly apply to Riv. The dude is a coding god.
---
ZG is a catch up raid where the gear is better than a ton of MC gear and it only takes 20 people. Resets every 3 days.
---
Honestly think it might also have to do with not being to loot what you kill. If someone likes to farm 20 rams to help summon the wolfriders, he couldn't even loot most of them because it would've been someone else's loot and they are a mile away.
---
elvui is the base for me, basically everything else is another addon.  the bars and the chat are the only part of elvui that i still use lol.
---
I'll definitely check that out - do you have any videos on it?
---
Pulling Drek without the adds is not intended.  You can throw a snowball at Drek and only pull him.
---
That's actually insane - what chest and what do you get from it?
---
Yeah this one was completely different. The main thing was that losing against these guys always was so frustrating. You sat in queue for 15 minutes and then these people come around, completely ignore you and waltz over the field killing the boss and the game is over.  Extremely frustrating and annoying. 
---
The thought that I managed to rile up a defense and piss these people off like crazy is what gives me so much fun.
---
First download errtime.
---
Lol dropped today for me. I got stormrage and cenaurian pants in same raid.
---
hmm are you alliance or horde?  im coming from a horde pov,  so factoring in WF totem, which is huge for melee and a big part of why they'll typically/should be dominating the top spots of the meters.  
---
Granted the hunters are just below the top rogues/fury war's but still below on most fights.  Very few  you actually have melee move out.
---
Currently rocking Barbarous Blade...always sad.
---
the game already lost 70%, its not far fetched to assume another 20% within a year
---
You are correct, they barely do damage. I sometimes do 2 pack pulls so to me its more risky. Heath can sometimes dip to low hundreds (even with mana shield) if they crit a ton. 
---
Just sharing my personal experiences, not giving advice per say. Im not telling him “You should just farm in raid spec”. 
---
Am putting myself in his shoes, as he’s pretty new. Therefore as a newbie I would definitely feel its more “risky” than without Ice Barrier. Hope that clarifies :)
---
I see thanks
---
No wonder warriors go way out of their way to kill me in AV
---
However, all that is needed are people getting 15 honorable kills to create the brackets. And there will be a A LOT of people who want to maintain rank 3. Rank 3 gives you a 10% discount on all Vendors, this is an insanely good bonus nobody will want to pass up.
---
You're delusional if you think a single person making 150g per hour can "fuck over the economy" on servers that have 30k+ people on them.
---
Nobody is going to pay $150 per month just to be a little bit better at farming gold.
---
Considering you will probably spend most your game time after level 60 playing on a full server is better then a low pop server in regards of finding groups to do stuff
---
Someone needs more lucky doos!
---
Why don’t u vendor or de
---
Because people _not_ in those premades are playing 16 hours a day to keep up and get bracket 2 slots.
---
Then it's  settled, of course it's TBC values! This explains why ragnaros on Classic Beta had 3700 armor when he was spanwed in the end event. Ouro and Fankriss have had research on them aswell and they showed 3700 too. Only deviations I know are the reported 3000 on Kel'Thuzad (Caster armor?) and C'thun (Which is irrelevant due to weakness mechanics)
---
Thanks, I love learning!
---
No PvPers on Blaumeux. Now Horde 60s that roll around in groups of 3-4 ganking lowbies? Sure, all over the place
---
Vael is hardly a DPS check with 1.12 talents and consumable/world buff usage. You have a whole 3 minutes to kill him and he starts at 30%, so you hit execute phase super fast.
---
But yeah, you can clear BWL in full preraid blues, with current player knowledge and skill.
---
Just 1 tip, /Cleartarget[dead] etc will clear target on a feign deathed hunter. So for attacks like multishot etc I'd recommend not using those types of commands if you are considiring engaging in any pvp.
---
"first"
---
Actually not true. Alliance premades are too much honour for a bot or account sharer to keep up with if they aren't in, and horde the meta is farming single kills in AV (or other tactics that require a group). You can't keep up afking in tunnel.
---
Yeah, uh....if you're somehow clearing into AQ40 but not clearing BWL, what the hell is even going on there? The first boss of AQ40 is harder than everything in BWL except maybe Nef.
---
Isn't this the guy that got banned on twitch because he's weirdly overly obsessed with stream sniping and camping streamers?
---
Whaddaya mean what *chest*, you farm every chest in Graveyard, Library, and Armory.
---
Rogue required, btw... results may vary.
---
Hint: Wild Steelbloom and Fade Leaf sell very well as well as a few other items, within item range for 39 twinking as well but not required to do well.
---
idk if salty is the right word, more like pity
---
3 weeks later and you couldn't be more wrong
---
I'm on Blaumeux Alliance and although it was really bad ganking wise 1-50, 50+ is basically impossible. I can't do anything without at least 1-2 Horde 60s ganking me. Typically it's at the end of a big AOE pull and a rogue pops out of stealth to 1 shot me or they try to get it so the mobs kill me and I suffer durability loss
---
It's impossible to level normally as Alliance. Horde queues are crazy (Because surprise surprise, Alliance are leaving and population is out of control) so Horde just run around killing lowbies
---
I have not been in a fair 1v1 or even 2v1 fight vs. someone my level yet
---
&gt;Because it's an item that dropped that only they can utilize.
---
BoE items, especially epics are money bags. Deal with it.
---
All classes have equally good uses for gold.
---
Lol nice video I started recording the snowball deaths too. It’s the only fun in AV atm
---
NA is super uncompetitive when it comes to gaming. The Top of EU might have the semblance of a chance against the top of Korea, but the top of USA get whiped by Korea. 
---
It also translates to a few other things, for example: NA based raids have a lot more smalltalk and shit going on while in EU based raids it is typical for more than half the raid to mute themselves the moment they join the voicecom.
---
A repost so soon? Bold.
---
Hmm. TIL
---
Really just enable class colors, unless you're a healer or otherwise a class where you are actively using your raid frames.
---
No but I've considered it. Got my runs down to 27 minutes!
---
Guild I'm in is Loot Council, in fact I was recently put onto the council! I have arc helm, and I'm not too far away from being the most optimal person to get boots, problem is we haven't seen bracers in so long... I am gonna try to buy them, just need to be a good mage and actually farm gold again
---
Yowch, haha. Fine for levelling I guess but rough in pvp or certain farms. Have fun upping the game!
---
Yeah I feel like mace spec is probably the worst specialization ability/effect. I wish it were also 5% crit!
---
As a rogue you're also better off doing green quests and fighting green mobs. They will be less likely to dodge and parry
---
a long time raider that is a solid member of the guild is unlikely to gquit is what i meant.  A brand new raider who isn't even 60 yet is risky for a gquit at any moment.
---
i dont even know where to begin to make something even close to something quality content like this would shit out....
---
like, my content wouldnt even be considered literal shit compared to this...
---
Please promote this to other classes so they can untarget us more :D
---
You sure you have bags equipped on the 11 hunter?
---
If you still need help send me a pm and i can help you, atleast with zf....
---
.... Dps is fine. Its threat and healers having consumes for dispel heavy fights (Chrom) and lasting in Nef. Seriously, why do ppl think dps is the limiting factor here?
---
IMO if you're doing 90 minute clears it isn't casual.
---
Good bear tanks are a great addition to raids, youll have to put in a lot more work than a warrior though if youre main tanking sometimes/most of the times. Farming manual crowd pummelers is a bitch.
---
F that. I've been putting in 14 hr days. I'll never get ranked. 14 hr work days at the post office because you fucks order so much freakin' Amazon!
---
I would take two gathering professions to help make gold for your mount(s).

Skinning + mining or herbalism is popular.

it's truly awful.

“Can I need for my off spec?” Lol Fucken get bent
---
That Crash Twinsanity music. Instant nostalgia!
---
Makes me think of that Courage the Cowardly Dog episode with the banana people
---
As the opposite of this, the sheer satisfaction of finishing a warrior off with a big raptor strike is amazing.
---
Though not as great as doing it to a rogue, or better yet, another hunter.
---
This is a game, by definition, it's meant to be played to have fun. If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong. The internet can't tell you if you're having fun though. Are you having fun? 
---
It's not like you can't level another toon after this.
---
Well noone plays d until Balinda is killed, except for people trying to cut off the 60% mounts in the field of strife.  If queues weren't 15 minutes I doubt d would be encouraged though
---
Can’t help you with filtering but can say that weapon is in the game
---
On Atiesh, Cenarion BoEs are 170-200g. Not as much as the others, but not 60g.
---
well tbf if you bot then you don't need to spend your whole life haha
---
Plenty of bracket 1 guys are actively streaming every ranking session and have been since the launch of p2. The good groups don't need to bot or account share, and you can watch all the vods to see that they aren't.
---
How do they get you kicked? I thought blizz fixed the instant report kicks
---
Pugs do 90 minute clears.
---
Not so perceptive are we?
---
He was dead for that entire run across the battlefield, due to a bug. 
---
He logged to "*fix*" the bug and respawn behind enemy lines.
---
He's also alliance and using imorph to change his character model from Gnome to Undead.
---
It's bannable but, only will be banned when someone changes a major model and truely exploits something.
---
Depends on how much you repair.
---
One AV is enough to maintain rank 3 mostly.
---
BWL will only be difficult for guilds who are having issues with MC. If you can get through MC without wiping multiple times, and you've been getting decent gear from MC, BWL will be a joke in terms of gear check.
---
If your guild really can't handle the minimal mechanics of BWL, it may expose some of your worst players and shit tanks will be exposed since not every boss is tauntable, but overall should be a pretty easy tier.
---
when games go without a hitch it's 7-8 minutes for 3.8k honor, even with 10-15 hordes stalling it might slow down to 10 minutes but the extra honor from the stallers keeps the rate up. Even with the occasional fucked game it averages out pretty well.
---
&gt; Most efficient premades are getting about 3-4k a run. That's 5-6 runs/hour (10-12minute games).  
---
  
---
If they're getting 10-12 games then they're not among the most efficient. The ranker premade in my guild is getting 7-8 minute games last I saw.
---
thanks for the heads up!
---

&gt; The only reason LC holds items "hostage" is because if you don't find that type of stuff fun then you must not have that "pumper" mentality, and the item would be better suited for someone else.
---
This is a false dichotomy. You aren't either a crazed "pumper" with no ability to do cost/benefit analysis at one extreme, or a total faceroll casual who doesn't care if they are at the bottom of the damage meter at the other extreme.
---
Some of us can bring the AAA game when it's needed for progression, but don't feel obliged to pour time and gold down a hole for the sake of epeen when it's pointless.
---
&gt; Besides, those people who don't flask don't log in every day to farm gold and save up flasks anyway. They're full sleeper mode, just logging in once a week to raid.
---
Same false dichotomy. And even if it were true it would be a simple fix, just tell people that they will get loot priority if they donate a flask per raid night to the guild bank for later.
---
Really good players with consumables sure. Not average casual players.
---
Idk where wowhead got those numbers but they're dead wrong. Rank 14 requires being in 0.3% for the last few weeks, rank 12 - 2%. And that's only for the last bit, you can get close by sitting in a lower bracket for a while.
---
Why same server you want to kill rivals ?
---
I personally went for blue dragon mail set for more int and then eventually switched to barons robes/t1 chest
---
I don’t think so...
---
That was fantastic. Whats the song in the background that the video starts with? The one that sounds like it's a chorus of kazoos.
---
you dont even need a snowball. just pull them, have a tank kite the others out, other tank on drek and have the group stack opposite side and not engage anything but drek. CC dogs and pew pew.
---
but i mean, horde gets to balinda ~20faster than alliance can get to galv. and I have yet seen horde kill balinda first.
---
Well also it wasn't really the way to honor grind. And for months ran without xserver BGs.
---
Meaning the reason to go there was for large scale pvp, not end the game as quick as possible
---
you dont need to save blade flurry for crusader procs, not on multi-target
---
I'm a little biased since I'm a rogue main but after playing rogue, almost all other melee classes pale in comparison to me.  Rogue just has so many tools to make it a really fun class on top of their already beastly damage.     
---
Also using Distract to make people fall to their death.
---
Yes from damage taken (and given? By melee? Maybe). But not from dying.
---
I only got 2 pieces of gear in my first MC run! Only 2! 
---
In related news, my friend who plays a rogue and beat me to 60 by three weeks isn't talking to me anymore.
---
Which server?
---
If you’re planning on doing pvp, engineering is amazing. Mining is especially good on rogues because you can stealth into endgame areas and farm nodes not accessible by most classes without a lot of mob killing.
---
Yeah Once you have bwl on farm they probably won’t make mages reported for those raids and let you guys just do scuffed frost damage in fire spec fire fire immune bosses as the mage dps won’t matter as much
---
For pve, most guilds are fine taking an enhancement shaman on a raid. They provide nice buffs to the melee group and, especially if they're orcs, they're good candidates to be the designated Nightfall wielder. It's not strictly optimal, but enhance shamans aren't totally terrible and if you put forth an effort and aren't an asshole, you can get a spot in all but the most hardcore raid groups as an enhance shaman.
---
For pvp, they are kind of a meme spec. They rely hugely on rng for damage, sometimes you'll erase dudes in one hit with a windfury crit, sometimes you won't hit windfury for the entire length of a bg and your damage will be pitiful. You have nice tools like grounding totem, earthbind, an interrupt, but ultimately it feels like kind of a waste because elemental shamans have all those tools and have much more consistent damage, making them really strong in PVP, while enhance are a lot weaker.
---
Thank you! Ya it's very much against what's commonly accepted as fact, I liked writing that part a lot.
---
Thank you! I'll be sure to post again once it is.
---
As it turns out I just recently decided to roll a shaman for a change of pace (my main is a rogue and has been for years).  Not knowing anything about shamans it seemed like an interesting way to go.  I picked enhancement for no particular reason.  I’m going to tell you I wasn’t have a great deal of fun - the pace is so slow.  It’s what I’d call a thunk-wacker because that’s all you do... like a pally without the armor.  I keep with it and I’m glad I did - somewhere in the 70s I just started liking it.  I finally have enough spells and abilities to make it interesting.  Dungeons are more fun than questing.  They are set up to give party members boosts so you help everyone else become more effective and the more mobs you’re hitting the more powerful you become.  At the end of the day it’s your money and time so it’s your choice but as someone who’s just walked the path you’re on, I’d encourage you to stick with it, it’s going to get more interesting the higher you get.  Happy Hunting and Good Luck out there.
---
You're welcome, thank you!
---
Vs tremor totem and windfury? You realize not everyone gets a fear ward right? And sure blessing of salvation is nice, but if your tank is fury prot and knows how to play, threat shouldn't be an issue yet at this stage of the game and gear.
---
Blaumeux Alliance
---
The disenchant stuff is from what i have heard decided once that the loot drops. This means that even if you disenchant it in p5, it still gives you only large brilliant shards, because thats the only thing possible at the time they dropped.
---
That sucks. Are ANY of the servers at least close to 50/50?
---
Im on Grobbulos and ive had no problems. There are plenty of servers on this sub that everyone says are fine!
---
Warcraftlogs
---
cross server, anyone is welcome.
---
Problem is when you put that qualifier. Lots of unorganized guilds out there.
---
what's the first song in the vid? kinda bangs
---
Im not so sure what you mean by green quests, quests in much lower leveled zones`?
---
Ours got 7 epics on his first run
---
Yeah people said Blaumeux was fine too, not the case
---
I feel you. Hit 57 on my druid and was looking forward to raiding but I hit a slog and end game just doesn't sound fun to me. It really made me realize how much I love the leveling experience so I just made an alt and have been having a blast again.
---
Yeah as in what function does he use
---
I disarm every 1h warrior. You guys almost never have weapon chain or death grips
---
It’s all about intellect, bonus healing, and chain heals. Bring mana pots and runes to hurt yourself for mana. Mp5 isnt as good as it will be later on, as with min/maxing fights don’t last as long as they did in Vanilla.
---
Not every classes t1 is even good (I'm looking at you, paladins, dps warriors, and more). So that should by no means be even considered in whether or not a group can do BWL
---
most people already left. 
---
I hate to say it, but most of the fun in WoW was the leveling journey and Blizz Classic screwed it up by introducing honor late and having layers. 
---
Nost, Post nost, Elyssium, and Nortthdale all had it right. They were FRESH servers that completely took over the other because players like to start fresh at an even footing. No layers, just 16k players in the lvl 10 zones at once. I loved it. 
---
Best of all, the honor was ingame since level 1. So throughout the leveling journey, you would see a group of lvl 40s forming to attack stormwind, etc. It was a blast! 
---
You never had 30 people roaming around at 60 killing anything in sight because you had bgs and people had all the pvp they could want while leveling.
---
I've been 60 for 5 weeks and havent seen rag die once. Seems like no Pug can kill him and even casual guilds still have trouble because they are loose on requirements.
---
My gear is pretty much the same as yours, thats the point lol.
---
I went to MC for the first time last night (other than in actual classic) and got the tier 2 pants. But I'm still wearing a green chest. RIP buddy, I hope they drop for you soon.
---
Floor spec meta
---
Warrior.
---
Deleting a Priest with a 1k auto attack and 1.4k MS in one batch then a 1.8k Execute in the next batch is precisely as hilarious and satisfying as it sounds.
---
I wish I was one of these guys, ive raided 13? weeks now and havent even seen the leaf drop.. some cosmic fucking bad luck :(
---
Fishing is part of AV.
---
If fishing wasnt part of AV, the lakes wouldnt yield fish when you are fishing in them.
---
It's part of the objective of the map.
---
There was blue post regarding it that someone linked a while back.
---
Looking it up I've seen a few people mention this but no official Blizzard statement on it. I'd prefer it if you're right, though. It's not like nexus crystals would be hard to come by, with good guilds trashing most of the loot from MC, Ony, ZG, and some BWL pieces by then.
---
They are a meme.  It's a bad spec, and if you're looking for a melee class its probably the wrong one to pick.  You have autoattack and 1 melee ability, the rest is spell casting.
---
This has been talked about numerous times so I’d recommend a search (plenty of good tips to be found)
---
Tanking while you get pre bis should still net you a base of 15-20g per dungeon. More if you get a good boe blue/epic/orbs
---
Farming RTV is good but you have to do during off peak hours. If you keep seeing other people doing the same thing, it’s too contested and mostly a waste of time. 
---
Playing the AH is still the best way to make gold but it carries risk and isn’t that easy.
---
Only one side has a bridge, too.
---
So you’re telling me, you’d rather use a 1-8g potion than just tap and have a healer top you off?
---
Really hardcore guilds will be looking at running raids on their alts as well to provide more crystals.
---
Is power leveling a thing in classic wow? I'm making an alt and after leveling a warrior, I'm over leveling, but I'd like to mess around with a warlock. I have some buddies willing to run me through dungeons and stuff, is there an optimal set up for it?
---
That's  ~0.012% chance of happening.
---
Used to love doing this kinda stuff in games. Now I would just feel like I’m wasting my time. Getting old sucks.
---
Rep grind was done for me in the first week.  Having people still focusing on rep over honor is frustrating when honor is all youre joining for.

Arguably harder than Nef. Hell I’ve seen raids get smashed to pieces just trying to get through the Anubisaths...
---
Here's a big "Fuck you!" to all you premades who kicked out people who weren't in your premade.
---
True, true. We do split MC on Wednesdays then an alt/pug run on either Thursday or Friday. I could see us ditching the pug aspect by that point and having it as a pure alt run.
---
Yes you can, just can’t go the other way.
---
But muh parses
---
Tell them to push rank for pvp gear or get av exalted. Most people that whine about loot wont even take the time to get their bis from these two routes.
---
MORE DOTS!!!
---
For bosses yeah, especially the tank n spank ones, it just depends if you care about your parses
---
No more dots!!! Lol
---
Trash runs and whatever bosses they could do. I didn't say clearing AQ40 sorry.
---
Throw a snowball at Drek and punt him into the rest of the room.
---
what about unstoppable force + mace spec? Lower dps but lots of stun.
---
Accept friend requests when possible.

Just because you use that word, does not make it a bug.

Thanks heaps

They should, but they are not.

Thanks dude :)

If you have 5 NS you definitely should it’s an insane pvp build , Right now I’m 21/3/27 for pvp and it’s awesome I do some insane crits

Zg gear is very class dependent if it does anything for you.  Warriors will never show up after they get rep
---
Enchanting and tailoring are both gold sinks with little return for your investment.  Mining is excellent because of stealth.  There are great mining locations that are surrounded by elites that you can avoid, blind, or just solo the one nearest mob that other classes can't access.  
---
Engi has a lot of excellent gadgets that are useful in PvP and PvE that allow you to have a chance to resurrect a healer after wipes, mind control, AoE, stuns/damage, reflect spells, teleport to Winterspring and more. Since you can't track herbs and mining nodes simultaneously it's better to take one or the other, and mining supports engi so it's the most logical choice.
---
Rank 10 here - sent you a message on Discord, but it looks like you need to accept my friend request.

BWL definitely isn’t a cakewalk, and what’s more, you could say they put the harder bosses at the start, Razorgore (requires good coordination and strategy) and Vael (Requires good execution, very little margin for error) at least. Good guilds will still be clearing it on the first week but you can’t roll in there with a pug or level 55s and expect to get anywhere. Watch some strategy videos in YouTube to get an idea: https://youtu.be/xvBnGJqcZEU
---
Nice set
---
What is a good server to start Alliance characters on for my friends and I?
---
Regular pvp server, we just want it to be reasonably balanced.
---
Also pacific side if possible but eastern could work too.
---
Hamstring is all you need in any group pvp. It's much better to have 20 more dps and massively higher top end dmg from HoR than an occasional 1s stun that dr's with other stuns. Even better is sword spec procs or 5% crit and spinal reaper effect. I'd never use tuf over hor.
---
I have 3/5 NS right now but considering buying the belt and bracers so I can run full assassination. Those evis crits w hemo are so fun but so is 2 shotting ambush/bs mages :p
---
Honestly, alliance wouldn't care. Sure some might but most want quick games. As soon as a wipe happens, half the alliance team says "let horde win"
---
When a match turns turtle I afk and play my Switch. Alliance never bother to report you afk if you press autorun in the general direction of horde whenever you res.
---
I played about 15 AVs last week and didn't make rank 2.
---
Yeahhh, queues are pretty bad now. First week was alright but now it's a slog.
---
It’s mentally pitting yourself against another human being, not a raidboss that will do the same thing every week
---
My girlfriend and I do this but we clear Lethendris room also. More felcloth/runecloth and it's easier
---
Meanwhile our guild started gearing our enhance shamans with Helm of Ten Storms.
---
Shaman t2 helm has been dubbed "Helm of Million Storms" now due to the drop rate.
---
Isnt that basically just epgp?
---
Has blizzard even announced bwl? Blizz said we are looking at a 2 year ish life cycle, we are at 4 months 20 months left that's 5 months per phase remaining you will want the naxx/aq phases to be at least 6 months to give any player not in a good guild even a small chance in hell stepping into those.  Idk how this is rushed or "feels rushed"
---
probably because they are garbage and no one wants them in the good premades.
---
If you enlist someones help to farm like that, why aren't you guys just splitting everything 50/50?
---
Yeah man you can literally ambush and backstab right away and 2 shot somebody with that 120 energy it’s such a fun pvp build ! If I had daggers I would do that all day. I hit somebody with a 2800+ Evis the other day in bg and that was insane lol they never left CS stun I took them out so quick
---
Yes.
---
Nah there's people out there who actually take improved Frostbolt and still don't cast it on cooldown. Pretty sad when you check logs and see that they're doing 70% of every other mage's DPS with similar gear because they wait 0.5-1 seconds between casts. Why? Who the fuck knows. Some people are just clueless.
---
I always blast life tapping locks in raids. Dungeons are a different story, you get a rank 6 renew and time to eat after a pull :D
---
It still boggles my mind how hard people are going for BiS shit like it's a big deal esp when it's in a PvP environment. 
---
I promise the gear y'all are so worried about isn't going to make a lick of difference in the grand scheme of it all in PvE. You're still gonna slap the shit out of all PvE content in Classic period.
---
Sure chase BiS since it's something to do but getting mad at people for wanting to do something diff than you in a PvP environment is bonkers stupid.
---
And all the people chasing Rank 14, all I can do is roll my eyes.
---
You literally NEED those potions for ony p3 start
---
It will for sure. Last week was my first week raiding with my new guild as the only Druid and not a single piece of Druid gear dropped - I was kind of bummed because of all the "lOL DRUIDS GET GEARED IMMEDIATELY IN MC" posts on Reddit. This week, I got the gloves, shoulders, belt and Ony Tier 2 helm. So... you'll be geared before you know it!
---
A single shaman should use 8pc tier 1 in a raid for an extremely long time, so getting screwed there is understandable.  However try having 5 priest healers and not getting a single eye drop honestly no fucking clue how its possible...
---
The drop rate of most good melee weapons is 5%. That mean it takes 20 WEEKS of grinding them to get one of each. Only brutality blade is remotely common and a small amount of bad luck means you might not get many.
---
Getting rank and keeping them are vastly different things. Especially because last week was the week fucking everyone played AV constantly to get Exalted. Next month things will look a lot different, a lot less honor gained by everyone.
---
It only takes 500 rank points (if even) to maintain rank 3. You could probably maintain rank 3 with just the 15 honorable kills per week, or at least lose almost nothing.
---
He said maintain. Earning is different.
---
Great info, he’s a notorious fuckass on whitemane 😂
---
Warriors kinda shit on everybody with freedom, cant imagine how the core of every alliance pvp team isn't 1 druid, 1 priest, 2 paladin, 2 warrior, 2 mage and filling in the other 2.
---
I'm no expert though and I'm sure their team is comprised in a way to deal with a more traditional team.  You could set up some counter comp full of hunters, but they'll just get bodied by warrior teams with freedom all day.
---
I am very aware :(
---
“Grandma’s on fire, gotta go”
---
I was banned from the vent server and kicked from guild for a week.
---
For NA or EU? EU players cannot do BGs with NA players.
---
Who needs to go outside. Local grocery store offer home delivery for $5.
---
after BC for sure.
---
Obviously context here was in relation to 2h, but thank you for clarifying that 2h is same factor as mainhand.
---
However, this still doesnt prove your point because if you plot those graphs with realistic values (e.g 200-400 white swings), the new rage formula scales significantly worse than the old formula. It's only at lower damage does the rage improve. This should be pretty trivial to see from the equation itself considering we are adding a constant factor but then dividing by 2.
---
Wait what? The only 6 minute rag kill I've seen was a 25 man raid.
---
Yea worse then not defending at all... Lost so many shit because of those... Nice tower is defended, gets capped moment later, still no action from defender
---
Because everyone else played as much or more. Now people have started getting exalted and play less AV, meaning that you don't have to play as many by comparison to just stay at something like rank 3.
---
You're wrong.
---
I soloed about 15 kills to test it out, it was pretty slow and I have really good gear. Unless you get super lucky it isn’t worth it with dm/mara solo
---
Its not about when you are equipped enough to do so. The reason for DW tanking is to allow your raid to go more ham in raids, the same reason why you put MCP on feral tank and let them take on some bosses. It generates tons of threat. Going DW tank in 5 man dungeons because it is fun is actually just griefing your team. You'll end up using more of your healers mana in each pull. If this is causing your healer to bottleneck the time between pulls, you are griefing. If healer would already be the bottleneck the time between pulls, you are griefing even harder. If neither of those apply, you are still griefing because overpulling slighlty leaves you at a much higher risk of dying (=time wasted). When you look at skarms videos about dual wield tanking you have to realize that he is in a top end raiding team with the absolute best dps warriors, which will pull 1k dps on bosses with dal rends combo if they get lucky with crits and windfury procs in fights. In dungeons, you will never ever have to deal with that.
---
Few days ago I observed something interesting. Needed help with 2 elite quests and ask guildie for help. Without party, I taged mobs and let him do the killing. What surprised me - the amount of xp gained was different every time - basically - the more dmg I dealt the more xp I got - it was in range 40-150.
---
Now I'm confused.
---
If it crits, you are doing absolutely fat damage. Don't sleep on Sweeping strikes OR death wish. Both are amazing for pvp. Make sure to not waste sweeping strike charges on insignificant attacks though such as hamstring or say mocking blow for example unless you have to. You want to double your highest damage abilities.
---
Right now all I am doing is placing totems and earthshock + lightning shield. I actually like just auto attacking I don’t know why. Maybe after cast after cast after cast i grew tired of it.
---
It's not instant anymore, gives you a debuff for a few minutes warning you to engage in pvp combat
---
Nothing to do with getting old. Your outlook is the problem.
---
He was there first and aggro’d the mob patrolling the node. You came up and took it from him. There aren’t any rules against this but you’re in the wrong here bud.
---
HoJ trinket from Angerforge is one I can think of off the top of my head. 
---
Don't worry though, it'll simply move to Emperor Thaurissan's loot table meaning you have to clear the entire of BRD to farm it.
---
This should happen in Phase 5.
---
It isn't really worth it in my experience when maybe 1 out of 20 people will disarm. I won't even disarm sometimes because then that reminds them they can disarm.
---
&gt;+ windfury
---
He's specifically asking about ally.
---
Do you kill Kromcrush on a tribute run / can you?
---
GGR + Lobotomizer with either Aged Core Leather Gloves or Mugger's Belt.
---
Yeah you can kill the big demons solo, as they are fearable. You cannot enslave them though unfortunately. And they really have a mean punch, if fear breaks and they crit there's a good chance I'm instantly dead. Takes a while to do them, but with all CDs ready (especially on Dethcoil) it's not very difficult.
---
A fellow Mograine Horde player I see
---
&gt;specifically with bonereaver's edge, and even that isn't that great without windfury.
---
???
---
~~Just saying you don't need BRE to be 2h viable, OEB is very good as well.~~
---
Misread as "even that isn't that great WITH windfury"
---
This...Melee get soo much good stuff in AV , casters just offhand...Give us slightly worse mageblade to rivals UBF or at least ring !
---
Stop putting word in my mouth. 
---
No one said a person with 10 multi box can do that. However a person with 100 multi box can do that with this method.
---
If you don’t get it before that you will have to settle for the 2% drop rate from Angerforge becoming a 30% drop rate from Thairissan... oh no...
---
I need some of these. i need these coasters in my life
---
We have a few banks, also free gear to fill out newer raiders.
---
Lame
---
Funny how ppl call 10 out 40 ppl defending a turtle rofl
---
Wow, you must be seriously good. I mean, all sources in the web rate Mages, Rogues and Furies, even Hunters, a lot higher than Locks in p2. Congrats, maybe you are part of the 1% Lock elite on this planet.
---
I play Blaumeux too, which guild you in?
---
I don't really care. I'd be surprised if I ever ranked higher than scout with how often I can play.
---
Ye forgot u can just zone in from ubrs
---
Some, maybe.  But majority no.  Ours are playing 12-18 hours a day.  And a bunch are in my guild.  No account sharing at all going on.
---
I don't know, killed Ony like 10-12 times without anyone having the need for such a pot. You just stop dotting her before p3 hits and you should be fine.
---
Right, but the context is for ally, of which the majority of warriors are human and don't get as much benefit from OEB as anyone on hordeside does.
---
You could take on the elite demons in Winterspring and farm eyes of shadow. I solo’d them with my lock, but it was tedious. With two it should be faster.
---
But.... what if you have an ironfoe proc??
---
They could never add faction changes. Would a shaman just become a paladin and vice versa?
---
It's not my experience... Last time I went mc all loot was for rogues and warriors. FML and rng :P
---
Not even close, we approached the node at the same time and got to it at the same time he had aggro so couldn't loot. If we wanted to be real specific I got to the node first because he was still back peddling to it.
---
War masters should leash yeah ..we got worst version of AV in classic
---
This is correct, extra attacks cannot proc extra attacks anymore they made it that way for all extra attacks when they stopped windfury being able to proc itself
---
Makes sense having it layed out.  Thanks!
---
Usually I don't like PvP videos that much, but this one was genuinely hilarious. Good job!
---
It reduces repair costs aswell, right?   
---
Well I get 1 AV played currently on my raidchar to sustain R3.
---
Sorry dude but YTA in my experience.  Kind of immature behavior to take a clearly claimed resource in game if someone in your faction is on it already. 
---
Also i dont know the exact situation here but to say you did better because you didnt pull a mob is not any measure of success and a bit disingenuous. There is a healthy likelihood the mob would have gone to you had he not been there to leash it first - but again i dont know specifics.
---
I mean, you pay a premium to get shit first. That's pretty standard in most economic systems.
---
The real downside to being alliance in BG's... we don't get downtime in our honor grinding :(
---
I remember there was one guy who acc shared with multiple people and blocked an entire servers alliance from rank 14 by holding it for multiple consecutive months. It's the same now as it was then, you just know about it now.
---
Except one gives tangible, beneficial rewards that might get you laid.
---
i thought nexus crystals werent in the game yet? My guild has been holding onto gear to DE when they are added to the loot table
---
&gt;I was starting to feel like I was alone in thinking this.
---
Not a single person on this subreddit has the delusion that classic wow ranking is anything but a time sink.  It's been known for over a decade that skill is not required to rank up.  Have you done literally zero reading on this subject before coming to the conclusion?
---
+ Lava Runs don't take that much longer to begin with so in the end you get it way faster
---
That's the ret experience :)
---
Deal poor dps, pull aggro anyway because the first swing decides to proc and crit everything.
---
400+ people queue at same time. Tell me how any algorithm adjustment will change anything. Other than make there be arbitrarily long times for both factions
---
I use this all the time, so no idea what you are talking about.
---
The options are setup like this.
---
Group loot.
---
Everyone sets themself to ignore loot.
---
They set their loot to Rare.
---
Now there are only rolls for Rares and epics, and all greys are greens are as if it was FFA.
---
This is exactly what is needed for AV, and it already exists in the game.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Rj1MTJW.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Rj1MTJW.jpg)
---
Long horde queue times of 10+ minutes per game.
---
God I wish they would have had changes lol such a shit ranking system. You know it’s bad when private server players had to educated blizzard employees in how it worked
---
Actually so sad for my rogue because I know they feigned death but my sinister strike macro makes me lose all my combo points untargetting them lmao
---
=
---
Honestly I should just remove cleartarget[dead]...
---
Feels bad man haha
---
Bullshit
---
You're pretty late at this point, unless you start your own guild and find people who also started late and don't mind being behind on content, the chances of you finding a spot as a main tank are pretty low
---
Nice! An R programmer using bookdown to do wow analysis! Love it.
---
No, go for it!
---
You have to implant the first chlorophyll in your skin yourself, then they can reproduce and eventually make you energy. Just extract some from a room plant and injest them right under your skin.
---
Will the boss just disappear eventually if nobody kills him
---
Yeah that’s pretty much what I figured.
---
Oh shit, I thought it only reset when you started a SS on a new target. Maybe that was BC. Thanks for this awesome info lol
---
Well, I hate to tell you, but expansion gear becomes obsolete with every patch.
---
Not a strong argument.
---
parses
---
god this sucks
---
Armies need scouts.
---
Yep, you're a prick.
---
It's dumb, but whatever. I'll keep offtanking in Valor so I don't risk getting guildkicked.
---
WooooooosH
---
You *can* but it means you get less tribute loot, so people usually don't.
---
Your points are fair enough. Miniguilds within a guild is understandable. I feel like the disconnect towards others would make me inclined to not want to be there even if they were talented. It sometimes comes with the territory.
---
I'm on Earthshaker now :)
---
Cause horde have the game on Easy mode from the start
---
The only reason to go at that level is to grind the Ravasaurs in the southern region.  They are around that level and they drop greys that vendor well.
---
Warlocks can use swords js
---
Depends if you get fireballed, when p3 starts everyone uses their threat reducing abilities, then the locks take aggro cuz.. lock
---
I take the packed snowballs and i hit the AFk'ers in the cave back into the red portal until they've portaled out of the game. Takes a couple minutes, but gets them the deserter buff :)
---
It might be hard to join guilds that been raiding for months, but theres alot of guilds starting a 2nd raidgroup, alt-raids and newer guilds.
---
No, just the default empty terrain under the mountain.
---
Thank you for the support haha, it's gonna get even more weirder than this my guy
---
Jock: Repetition
---
Nerd: Reputation
---
When I'm spamming with the premade I sometimes pray I won't make it into a game just so I can use the restroom.
---
No offense man but why are you staying there? That sounds miserable
---
Like I said for myself it's a huge debate. Stick around and get to do the content early like I desire... or have a more fun time with very friendly and sometimes new players.
---
trust me im used to that anyways. Im on a 20/80 server horde heavy. Nothing new
---
What are you grinding that you can kill 2-3 mobs per minute consistently?
---
Literally didnt do anything. 
---

---
English is not my first language, so yeah. I tried my best to explain my comment to you, being as nice as possible, but all you had was to pick on my English. 
---
You dont know me, and based on a comment you can tell how i am? I never stereotype. I never instigate on social platforms, as everything is subjective.
---
You can have your opinions, i can have mine. I’ve tried my best to explain to you, and even understood your point of view. 
---
Yet, after having nothing useful to contribute, you point out my mistakes (which does nothing) and call me out for something I didn’t even do, and to make it worse, you stereotype me with the little to non existent interaction we had. 
---
So yeah. Im the bad guy here due to my lack of command over English, and I apologise. Thank you sir, and have a nice day :)
---
There’s a lot of guilds that run multiple raid teams, I wouldn’t give up on tanking. It’s a harder position to fill but that’s always been true.
---
Assuming you kill 30 an hour, at 1% drop chance you should get 1 after 3-5 hours 
---
you probably have to split it with a warrior unless you are getting boosted by a friend/guildy
---
so 235g, if you can farm that much in 5hours then it's more worth to you to just buy it off the ah. if you are getting boosted by a friend/guildy though then farming it is much more attractive option
---
this math is obviously not perfect or anything and you may kill less than 30 an hour or more and you may get pked farming them and you could get really unlucky with spawns and get only dogs and so on but you should be looking at it like this if you don't enjoy your gold farming or your eye of shadow farming 
---
if you enjoy either eye of shadow farming or gold farming then choose that method, enjoyment&gt;gold/hour
---
This is good
---
Losing has much less to do with honor/rep than you think it does.
---
Yes, but mobs are elites there, giving more exp.
---
Left a comment :D that's so nostalgic man, reminds me of when I was younger
---
A 2 and a half hour MC/Ony clear without personality is a big step up from my last guild, which is an alliance that still takes 2 and a half hours to down Lucifron. Baby steps.
---
lol what misplaced narcissism led you to post this?
---
Will do mate, I've got some other content on my YouTube channel if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/snackybox
---
Can't snowball fishers into the portal.
---
couldn’t disagree more... the av grind is real, especially on Alliance side.... plus caster rings don’t come out until p6, basically when they become worthless
---
What’s parses and why do people care?
---
65% upvoted.
---
35% are premading alliance on discord
---
his class is a bug
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Yeah.. might jist need to look for a backup
---
Thank you man honestly :D
---
Sorta like pulling Drek without killing any warmasters
---
We actually talked about allowing Rag to submerge, because we haven't seen it, and it'd be a fun experience for the guild.  I don't personally remember ever killing him pre-submerge in vanilla.  I wasn't ever a serious raider or anything though.
---
Nah he kinda does though. 20 weeks of a 5% chance is 65% chance of seeing it drop, so with average luck it's likely you'll see 1 of most weapons in 20 weeks.
---
Is it necessary to care about parses in MC..?
---
Decay is honestly the best part of EPGP. Effort points is the weak link where corruption can spread like plague, but at least there's decay.
---
Ohh fancy audio system to hear the sound of your weapons missing
---
Surviving?
---
For early kills FR is important, especially for the tanks.  You probably want the raid to have a fire pot, and preferably a greater when you're confident you understand mechanics for the kill.  Worst case scenario, go to ubrs and MC to get the FR buff.  Pretty hard to fail if you take the time to get it for the full raid.  Of course, that's easy for me to say because fire pots were 1/3 the price they are now when we did our first.
---
Like to do it as a paladin too, but too many ppl dont understand that hawing a pocket healer is ≠ with charging into the enemy raid hoping to stay alive.
---
D&amp;D is the lesser evil
---
LITERAL LAUGH OUT LOUD. BRU
---
I tried to explain it to you and help, but you’re  obviously not interested in that. I’m not going to waste my time here, bye.
---
Statistically it actually comes out worse than he says.  But I get the feeling that's not what you were implying.
---
It’s canned confirmation bias
---
what did i just see
---
&gt;Their
---
I got hit by rags knockback last night and flung into melee range where he turned around and smacked me dead before I'd landed.
---
I was topping dps fuck you rag.
---
How come the rogue is wearing Warrior T2.5?
---
Both sides have afkers, its not some special alliance thing. Innocent people getting kicked out of games is way worse.
---
Idk I’ve been a very very successful flat carrier in my shaman career.
---
Eat, sleep, raid, repeat
---
This is not a balanced or competitive game. The loot you earn does not mean you are good at pve or at pvp. It’s just there for the illusion of that and for you to have fun. This game is so heavily loaded with RNG in pvp that I don’t get why people take it seriously in competitive, even with consumes its just a mess.
---
Awesome, will send this to our fury warriors!  
---
Found a little typo.
---
„We can we now see“
---
Hah, I am of course referring to the World PVP.
---
Gotta kill at least two
---
Nah. Hor is fine and mace spec shouldnt be slept on. The thing is I feel like youre expecting to 1shot people with it since its legendary, but you probably hit like a mack truck already.
---
&gt; for no discernible reason
---
There's a very discernible reason.  They want fish.
---
Bruh
---
I head that too, sometimes, on horde and I’m like if it’s just a game aren’t you playing to have fun? You enjoy losing? It’s one thing if I was going ape shit being toxic but just trying to lead the BG isn’t detrimental.
---
Seriously.  There's no going back from this.  Didn't want it changed?  Shouldn't have been exploiting up front.
---
Adapt and overcumm little fuck. Go into melee range stupid
---
Ah thanks man! Good to know!
---
That's still wrong, tho. 
---
Archmage robe: not replaced
---
Lionheart: not replace
---
Truestrike: not replaced
---
Savage Gladiator Chain: maybe replaced by AQ40, maybe in Naxxramas.
---
Cloudkeeper: not replaced
---
There is a *shitload* of gear that isnt going to be replaced, not even in BWL. 
---
They dont have to, but they also dont have to raid in my guild, because I simply dont want to carry people. I want to play with equals, not be the DPS kindergardener of noobs not willing to play on my level. 
---
Do you invite people into your competitive premade matches in CSGO to carry them to their rank?
---
7.8 - Too Many Clothes
---
It refers to data recorded on https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/
---
Most guilds have someone logging each raid, that is, using the in-game feature to record the combat log to a text file, and submitting it to this site. With the site, you can view extremely detailed information about every fight your raid records. It's useful for all kinds of things, like figuring out problems in rotations, or seeing if someone's slacking on consumables.
---
The site also compares your dps on each fight to everyone else of your class and spec (and, optionally, gear level) and assigns you a ranking for each fight you do. When someone says they got a 95% parse on a fight, it means their dps was better than 95% of all records on the site of their class/spec for that fight. There's also healing parses but those are less competitive than dps.
---
It’s not to late. A lot of times people want to switch their mains or take a break. Get in a raiding guild. Even if it’s to dps. But let them know you want to tank. At some point you will get your chance.
---
I can agree with that.
---
This isn't an exploit, you can do it going forward as well, but it is much harder to pull off..
---
&gt;takes 2 and a half hours to down Lucifron
---
I didn’t know this was possible.
---
There are still people who just gearing up and are just now starting their raids. You could easy be an offtank.
---
yea ill travel back in time to tell metzen give caster weapon
---
I think posting this here was a mistake lol
---
Personally I don't give a shit if anyone steals a node, whatever the situation. It's a couple of herbs. Who gives a shit lol. Whoever gets this mad for this type of shit has big issues.
---
r/wooosh
---
No other game has the feeling of a max IAS Fanacitism Zeal pally
---
You can also demote people to social and have them lurk around in the guild. 
---
But I wouldnt want to raid with slackers and if enough assemble in one raid group, I'd ditch mine and join a more serious guild that actually plans to clear future stuff.
---
If you can get into a premade discord it shouldn't take you a long time 
---
20k honor an hour is the number they throw around, even at 15k an hour it's pretty possible to get there  
---
an easy way to figure out what bracket you need for rank is just bracket 8=rank 8, bracket 5=rank 5, however if you want it to be a bit faster you want to try to hit 1 or more bracket over the rank you want 
---
on my server bracket 8 tops out at around 160k, bracket 9 is topping at 240k. I imagine it's similar for most servers 
---
on a premade at 15k an hour getting 200k or so is not that hard over a week
---
That was beautiful, lol
---
I have more than 300k honor in the last 3 days and my rank hasn't moved an inch from rank 1, will it show what I did this week in the next week?
---
So I see that a lot of people in here are dead wrong about vael. Vael is a tps and healing check, not a dps check.
---
Or it is vice versa, since kids came to play game of their grandpa youth.
---
2 losers arguing about a digital herb, what the fuck is wrong with you losers...
---
hmmm, maybe i should mention it to my gl. Ours seems a bit more chaotic
---
Heyyy, fuck you
---
Idk what you should get at max level but herb is a good money maker while leveling.
---
I see the problem, but this happens with black lotus and rich thorium veins all the time. Everyone needs it in some way. Either you manage to loot it fast enough or someone else will either loot it or attack you, if they're from the opposite faction.
---
That's litteraly 50 or 100g. Nobody cares if the first guy has to clear mobs around the node and can't loot fast enough. Even if the second guy passes, it's in the open world, a third guy could come in and take it.
---
And i'm playing warrior main, i've been "robbed" the same way and i should be complaining, but i don't. That's the game and there is no community made rule for open world high value loot. But yes it's still a dick move, i agree.
---
Thanks, you saved me the next 30 minutes trying to figure this out.
---
Yes they will still always have non premade People in their Group. There is no way to Queue as a premade therefore there is alwalys some error.
---
Can just hope they get plenty of AFK'ers :,)
---
I don't even remember the submerge portion of the fight, since I've only seen it once. I did see a pug where literally no one healed the MT. 4 heal spells total on the first attempt, second attempt the moment the raid took damage, every single healer started healing the raid, so I went from topped off, to 800hps for ~5 seconds, to 100hps for ~6 seconds from remaining 2 HoTs, to dead. I did the math because the raid broke up with someone claiming I was "too hard to heal," and I was like "bullshit, I did most of the healing."
---
2H warr on horde side is OP if you can play a decent warrior. In our guild we have a 2H warrior Who is parsing around 98-99 on every boss in MC
---
So you made it yourself, didn't you?
---
from a better leveling zone in the barrens to more competent players, horde have it good
---
Sadly, this
---
Please share it
---
There's no progression in Vanilla.
---
People think that at some point, raids will offer some sort of resistance may it be BWL, AQ or Naxx. They won't. The mechanics are too simple. The gear checks are inexistant.
---
Was 400+ on my server, I farmed several times with guildies and a friend, got it after 3 hours.
---
That's half the reason why it's nice to disarm. They'll try to do the same, but you're immune so they'll waste rage and GCD.
---
Most well geared (i.e. not trivial to kill anyway) will be immune to disarm, though. It's a bit of a gamble.
---
Well, I dualbox palladin+mage and can join any dungeon group as ranged dps and healer. In the open world pally serves as frontline in his hybrid build. Also mage eliminated pally need for water and Mp5 buff allows mage to dish out solo target damage without going oom or give extra AoE.
---
Appreciate it! One good thing about the late start is that I fully intend on enjoying the journey. You'd think with as much time as I have had to think it over I would know what class I'd be playing! Super hard decision but I believe I'll begin with a warlock. I only made it to 39 my first time around as my lock was my twink alt. I really want to experience raiding as I was hyper focused on PvP in Vanilla. I also intend on having a druid and paladin in due time.
---
&gt;He'll go down quick for the people who know what they're doing
---
And "know what you are doing" doesn't require much. Melee out, melee in. That's all. People can fly from fireblast as much as they want and that effects nothing. As long as your melee doesn't die because they ignore one mechanic that makes difference, you should easily have DPS to kill Raggy without submerge.
---
Only times I've seen submerge is when Raggy is done with 30-35 people instead of 40 and those times it's really close and he dies in 10 seconds after submerge ends.
---
Having 6 minute Raggy fight doesn't sound like lack of skill but purely lack of motivation to learn one of the most simple fights in this game. If guild struggles with Raggy currently it might be sign that guild isn't going to make it very far. It's fine if everyone in group is ok that their progress is slow and no one actually gives a sh\*t about how long it takes to clear raids. But if same guys who are doing 6min Raggy now are talking about AQ and Naxx, they're gonna face hard times.
---
(Not so) subtle brag.
---
You can't post something where there are two different points of view and automatically assume people will back you up, just because you were the one that posted it. Maybe it went down just as the other dude stated. Literally no one can be the judge of this argument. To me both parties seem like they are not the finest guys (you for seeking attention and validation, him for his immature language). Always look on the bright side of life! Merry Christmas to the both of you =)
---
Because thats the beauty of wow, you can do whatever tf you wanna do , now quit being a whiny bitch gather a group and handle those rogues
---
and in av losing isnt even as bad as in wsg or ab since when both focus on offense one side is simply winning slightly more.
---
Blaumeux hasn't even been that bad since bgs came out
---
Helped my friend farm it. We gave up and bought it after 3 days of non stop farming without anything to show for it.
---
Lvl 48 players give honor to lvl 60s.
---
Maybe he thought it was a weird flex but ok
---
Amazing guide. I would love to see more on the crit cap, potentially a graph showing crit cap vs. current +hit% with 300 skill and 305 skill.
---
With and without HS queueing if possible? While queueing is a nice tool, I seem to be even in dps with the more geared warriors who use it while I just play old fashioned style. So it would seem to me that the dps increase isn't worth the trouble of losing one eye that I could use to see my surroundings.
---
You KNOW it’s bad when ele gets compared as “more consistent”.
---
It's true. My uncle works at Blizzard. Trust me I'm a gnomish engineer
---
Seriously fuck off with this terrible advice. You come into a vent thread and tell me to stop whining? You shouldn’t have even left a comment.

Scholomance is pretty fun but you need around Mc / bwl / blue pvp gear levels for it.

Why is muggers belt trash?

Yes i can leave a comment seems like you are not comfortable with people being able to to whatever tf they wanna do in a public space, spoiled brat, and yea im tired of people like you whining all the time about how other people decide to play the game, There is not a CORRECT way to play wow. It wasnt an advice it was an observation.
---
Quality footage and cancer editing.
---
Well done, please continue!
---
Awesome UI, what’s it called?
---
Yes, im asking how do you work it out?
---
Armor's effect on effective HP is linear, so all armor pen is equally valuable (that is to say, very valuable).

I imagine some kid would take this up

We have absolutely no way to validate a Discord comment made by a random citizen on the internet.

Ohh! We‘ve got a celebrity here!

But it’s on the internet
---
Is there an Option to disable Details in PvP/BGs?
---
Just go rush objectives then. Kill the lieutenants and cap two bunkers. Easy 3k honor in a couple of minutes.
---
You mention a 1.5s offset caused by weapon switching in the execute switch section, specifically in the last graph's subtitle. Can you elaborate on this? Do you lose autos and/or GCD when you weapon swap?
---
True, Thats why I said what I said. You dont have to assume its true but its definitely interesting to talk about things like this.
---
Had 3 different people Horde side do it to me the first day. All 3 had no clue we can blink before hitting the ground.
---
Today they learned. 😂🤣
---
&gt; alliance complaining about not winning AV
---
In what universe? They have a really big advantage, don’t they?
---
Have you tried leveling in Plaguelands as Ally? Literally impossible
---
I wasn’t expecting to sit here and read all that, but I did, and was sad that the rest isn’t finished!
---
The bracers are super good. Belt not so much  
---
And bracers I mean for a pvp happy balance/restro hybrid :)
---
Bur
---
Started about the same time as you, no stormrage leggings, full tier except the belt and bracers because none of those have dropped either. I feels
---
yeah it doesn't make a difference where you fish in terms of leveling. My recommendation, esp for alliance, is to just sit in barrens and fish for deviate fish. Best value, requires only a low fishing level, high catch rate, and safe/easy to get to. 
---
Also get the addon called Fishing Buddy. When there's a catch, it will play the sound loudly even with wow minimized (i.e. if you're surfing the net). Also makes fishing very easy (double right click to fish + auto loot). So just open wow when you hear the catch, right click a few times, then minimize and continue surfing.
---
Bracerc are good for feral tanks but bracers of prosperity are much better, you also have the other bracers from dm
---
Even on farm we use a greater fire prot on rag kills. It makes healers job a lot easier. Stopped repotting it thougH, shits expensive.
---
No dwarf paladins...damn shame.
---
there is no word filter, it is as simple as meeting a report threshold to get muted. i dont get why people have so much blind faith in companies and spout this nonsense. reality is that their report system is easy exploitable since release and they had more than enough time to improve it *if they wanted to*.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
/u/HardstuckRetard is correct
---
Mages can also blink just before hitting the ground. Ice block works as well but wouldn't want to waste the a CD.
---
It’s never worth it unless you are part of the first 60s on a server and have the devilsaurs locked in with cross faction collusion.
---
If you look at subscription numbers then Classic+ makes the most sense imo. They have two big options here, Classic&gt;TBC&gt;Wrath or turn Classic into a whole new MMO. The long term revenue from a new Classic+ MMO is massively larger than Classic&gt;TBC&gt;Wrath imo.
---
You should still be able to take them 1v1 as long as you're pvp speced. Although with a pocket healer, yeah you're fucked.
---
This whole game is a waste of time just as much as socializing is...
---
I’m leveling a mage alt just through aoe grinding. I’m level 44 and I’ve made roughly 200g so far just leveling. Might be worth it just leveling a mage for the gold making potential
---
Is it possible that blizz is exploring the idea of classic+? Ofc! Just as they are likely to explore TBC and the content beyond shadowlands.
---
So no way to say what is going to happen. They might get classic+ or tbc 50% ready and then scrap the whole thing.
---
I love the fact that it is a "Fury Warriors guide" but you included arms 2h-stuff too. Really great! Looking forward to the rest
---
Our guild will prioritize our 1 enhancement shaman, but mostly because he is the type of guy who can help out any class with their class mechanics/gearing, he farmed both treant's bane and savage gladiator, bought all BiS BoE gear he could get his hands on, and is grinding all the flask and elemental protection potion recipies. Because of his absolutely insane dedication, he more than earns his spot in the raid, even though we probably could ask him to respec resto and bring in another warrior in fresh dungeon blues, and end up with faster clears.
---
Moral of the story: enhance requires more prep and effort to make it work than most other classes, and even then, you still have drawbacks, such as being quite limited on threat, and mostly being there to totem twist anyways.
---
Alliance almost always wins AV.  The only thing we bitch about is when people screw up the rush and it takes us longer than 10 minutes to finish.
---
Fuck it. I raid with PvP spec atm.
---
PvP on a PvP server mate
---
The Alliance almost always wins AV, lol.  The only thing you'll catch us bitching about is when people mess up the zerg and it takes us longer than 10 minutes to finish it.
---
You're trying to argue with an abrasive idiot. Druids are great offtanks, can heal your melee dps in a pinch and will save your raid battle rezzing your tank that got crit or one of the vital healers.
---
Try offtanking with a warrior. Your dps will be fucking shite. At least a druid in hybrid spec can perform at about two thirds of your melee dps, without MCP.
---
I had all of my cds, I chose to leave him alone because I fucked up and helped him mistakenly. It was amusing, I fight many fair battles...and he was full health. Not sure what youre trying to prove lol.
---
Something tells me you die a lot to rogues
---
Thanks man!!
---
Prot isn't that bad is it ? It's dope for dungeons at least, and tanking raid bosses is doable with blessing spamming, no ?
---
Why wouldn’t you wanna spend a little gold to make the raid go faster and personally do better? Are you against consuming in general?
---
The world first R14s almost exclusively used AV to honor grind.
---
Link? Because I've never seen anything suggesting that.
---
I would go with the Zeal + MS....they score pretty similar on stuff like classicwowbuilds.com iirc but honestly, I think it's better than krol if not just absolutely equal. The proc rate is insane and is up every fight and turns it into brutality blade for 15 seconds every time it's up. Also, you already have it, so no need to drop the 300g+
---
How about "/cancelform [noform:5]"? Or whatever the number is for humanoid form.

It’s just the lave underneath the BRD entrance area

Makes sense, thanks!

imagine actually believing this  😂   😂   😂
---
Yeesh, well, look. We did, this was back a few weeks ago, we couldnt do it two man so we did it three man. How do you split a crystal in three ways? The two crystals I’ve seen hasnt been with the same group spo it wasnt like ok you got this I get next. I’ve been abysmally unlucky with crystals so far and dont really get why people are treating it like I havent even tried to get them or such...
---
I mean, that's the point, right? Lol
---
Yeah I'm confused. Alliance wins AV, we lose all of the other ones. But hey at least we got AV.
---
Thanks man!
---
The shadoweave set is cheap and good. I have to admit i'm not too sure about the spirit value for shadow priests. If you prefer some more spirit at a slightly higher price, go for dreamweave items, or mix them up a bit.
---
Goonna see later
---
That's the only way they can win, duh.
---
Weapon swapping triggers a GCD yes, and of course it also disrupts your current weapon swing.
---
Your mainhand has a 9% miss chance, your offhand has a 9%+25% miss chance. Having queued up a heroic strike means the 25% miss chance is removed from your offhand as well. So your guild mate is using more heroic strikes.  
---
You are also both above "optimal" hit: He only needs 6% (assuming he's using axes) and you only need 9%. If you use edgemasters you'll also only need 6% but your glancing blow damage penalty will be reduced as well.
---
As a troll you should definitely get edgemasters. 
---
11% hit is more than optimal. You only need 9% (5 weapon skill is already around 3% hit,

Of all the wow killers I really miss warhammer online. That is the only mmo that I feel is on par with classic.
---
Pvp shadow is great but most guilds don’t really want you. Most will take one but there is no need for more, and you will get gear slowly. Is fun though, with the right guild. PVE your not in for a fun ride.
---
pugs (quality of players), premades stomp games easily though.
---
If you love the unique kind of sensation you get from moments like these, I highly recommend solo traveling IRL, it's basically doing this but out in the real world. I have such good memories.
---
Or can he? Periodic table was discovered while sleeping, after all.
---
Join a semi hardcore guild.  It's honestly the sweet spot for raiding if you are a casual but competent player.  Find guilds recruiting on your server look up their logs on warcraftlogs and find a guild with sub 2 hour clears.  Yeah you'll have to bring some consumes and put in a little more effort than pugging, but the amount of headache and time saved will be immense.  I've tried to put mc on my alt a few times, it has taken 4+ hours every time, and no group has killed rag that I've been in.   Even factoring the time it takes to farm consumables on my main, it's still faster MC clear on my main.
---
Karma

How is stating you are going on a date considered a brag?

Prot is a class designed around being crit... it just doesn’t work like it should.
---
AYAYA any cuties?

These are quality
---
You won't need necropile, just get some green eagle gear from AH, should be fine. Zf with 3k hp and 6k mana is good enough
---
Most likely they just RDP via phone but it never hurts to report them.
---
I have no idea. I did it back in vanilla. And it will also depend on which server you play. You should check ah and see for how much they sell. It made me very rich back in the day.
---
Yes
---
Ironically I made a tinder profile for my mage and set to swinging both ways and the ratio of matches for boys:girls was roughly equal to the faction ratio horde:alliance on my server.
---
Went to Ony last night and won the Stormrage Helm by default as the only druid there. Gotta love it :D
---
Yeah except in 1.6 everyone was wearing max fr gear so killing him took 3ish tanks at least.
---
I have no idea. I did it back in vanilla. It also depends on your server. You should check out the auction house and see for how much they go. 
---
It made me very rich back then.
---
at least wear Gray and do the support quest.
---
I like the hidden bid.
---
All get one bid that they whisper to the ML, highest gets the item.

still win enough fights, dont need a crutch. its as bad as potting. why show a vid if you use stuff that doesn't require skill. might as well brag about killing lowbies

Rogue closing in to Raiding here.

1. My profession is Leatherworking. If I plan to buy Devilsaur gear, should I still take Tribal or can I take Elemental then?

2. I play with Assasination (I know combat is more dps in raids, I just enjoy the Ass rotation more). What are the pre-bis daggers I should aim for?
---
3. What consumables should I use in my first raids?
---
look a falling gnome
---
pally gear :|
---
Fun! No time to finish now, but I’ll check back later
---
The better option is Classic&gt;TBC&gt;Classic 2.0
---
The problem with TBC is not primarily the gameplay, but sending people off to a new world and making the old one obsolete. The class design is good.
---
Therefore all they need to do is to close the dark portal, revert everyone back to level 60 and flesh out the unused zones with new content. New people can level 1-70 entirely in Azeroth. Maybe add some new 20-60 zones to make the experience fresh.
---
Classic+ makes no sense when they already did so much good work with TBC. The only option is Classic 2.0 that gets packaged as an expansion.
---
Agreed, "You'd have to be fool" to assume blizzard will put a copy of retail Demon Hunters in Classic with all the mobility they got Of course they will tweak the class for Classic and change a couple things up
---
So griefing?
---
If you down Ragnaros before it submerges, you have enough DPS for BWL, but the majority of the instance is not a DPS race.  Guild will have to supply Onyxia cloaks and flasks for Tanks, and some resistance gear apart from that it's mainly game mechanic knowledge. There may be some talent optimization on some classes, Priest will have more Power Infusioners and at least 1 Shadow Weaver.
---
I'm horde and only had one loss all day yesterday. Alliance must be fuming.
---
Say thank you to your healer :)
---
Ok boomer
---
Its amazing, not perfect but better than Retail in almost every way possible.
---
That restriction only applied to free server transfers. You can pay 25 and transfer wherever the fuck you want, select a PvP server from the drop-down and you are ready to go.
---
It's 18, and it's also not just on oh, it's for both. Qing hs/cleave changes ur attack to a special and specials don't recieve dw negatives, and even though ur oh never hits with hs, qing hs changes ur hits during the q to specials removing oh dw neg done right.
---
Seems to me like it's the best dungeon tank. Has the best aoe threat. I can't wait to get my pala to 60 and tank with the engi shield.
---
He's a badass too fuck the haters
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Druid gear had higher drop rates. Every week feels like every boss that can drop Cenarion or Stormrage, WILL drop Cenarion or Stormrage.
---
We sell em instead lol
---
Dude he is talking about making AV the BG that doesn't give the most honor. Because that basically just deletes WSG and AB because nobody will Play it. Not even premades.
---
Meanwhile you would much rather Play AV with complete randos and want even more honor for it :D
---
I bet you are one of the AFK People. Stop crying in alliance and start actually playing.
---
If we had WSG give more honor than AV (at least for pre mades) we would have much less shitty games in AV as well because all decent Horde Players would be doing WSG anyway.
---
Noo you just go ahead and QQ about alliance like alliance apparently always does instead of reading the post and actually using your brain...
---
God I should have rolled Horde again....
---
Like you have anything better to do while waiting for 2 min at the start of every match.
---
I would love it. But only to the Person handing the flag in. Since I am druid :P
---
As someone who actually plays in this bracket. It's nowhere as bad as people let on here. I see at best 3-5 thinks out of 20.
---
I wonder, that one ranged to melee macro made me think, could I bind my Raptor and Mongoose to my auto shot macro so when in melee i can just spam my auto shot macro and eventually if i get range it will immediately start auto shooting again
---
I think it has more to do with the brain damage dps classes have that causes them to not hear "stop dps". I got it to when rolling a rogue alt!
---
Funny you blame rogues when most, if not all, players are guilty of this. At least I solo gank instead of rallying with 10+ to gank 1 person. Horde on my server cant survive without a raid group to kill 1 person
---
You should care about self improvement. Every raid you should aim to perform a little bit better relative to yourself. Tracking your parses is the best way to do that.
---
Would have rolled my rogue first thing instead of wasting time leveling a hunter to 38 before rerolling.
---
you forgot the crusader proc as well !
---
Am tank. Yesterday, i got pulled around by "can you come tank X for us?" by guildies for 5 hours, interupted by a quick onyxia, before 3 more hours of "wanna come tank X for us?".

In soviet tankistan, group finds you.
---
Well that certainly made my morning waking up to that! Thanks!

So casual = unable to complete base content?

You don’t get 6k by being in a Zerg. You get too little honor per kill and quickly end up in diminishing returns. You get 6k by getting lots of 70-220 honor kills.
---
Maximising dps is fun and all, but it's far from necessary to beat it. Unless you're deliberately trying to set records, I don't see anything wrong with preserving some gold instead.
---
All I heard was jerk off.
---
&gt; Everyone sets themself to ignore loot. 
---
Right theres the problem, its not an automatic loot option that can currently be applied to a raid as i had said.
---
This takes new coding time and money, which blizzard wont apply unless they absolutely have too.
---
It isn't.  It's not as good as Nightslayer, but it's immediately below it.
---
They don't care in the slightest if they have 5-8 afk'ers in game
---
In fact they prefer afk'ers over people who try to defend since the single most important thing for premades is that the games end quickly, win or lose.

Quick question as a SM/Ruin Warlock.
---
How important are points in Fel Concentration and Intensity? A lot of guides suggest skilling it but I am note sure if it is really worth it.
---
Talking about pve. I don't really use the advantages it provides. Is there something I am missing?
---
I am currently using [this](https://i.imgur.com/2XPG9xL.png) build.
---
He didn't die pre-submerge in Vanilla. He was a three-phase fight.
---
He's not a three-phase fight any more because:
---
- Player understanding of DPS rotations are better.
---
- Payer understanding of raid compositions are better.
---
- Talents are in 1.12 format, which are significantly more efficient and relevant than they were in early vanilla WoW.
---
- Gear is in 1.12 format, which is significantly better than it was in early vanilla WoW.
---
- Gear that wasn't even available when Rag was current is available in Classic because of the 1.12 start.
---
All of the above will render everything probably pre-AQ40 trivial. MC is being pugged largely successfully. BWL probably won't be pugged or won't be for a while but again most semi-HC guilds will be getting through it without needing to go all out on consumes.
---
AQ40 is probably going to be the point where the "good" raiding teams start to define themselves not on just "we clear raids faster" but on "we actually clear the raid".
---
This is great thanks!
---
Expected him to tank in a dungeon.. *wow*!
---
Showing off all the macros in STV without any hassle. Plays Horde ofc
---
That is bullshit.
---
Nobody Queues AV because they love the BG and want to farm honor. They Queue because they have to in order to maximize their honorgain.
---
If WSG gave more honor People that are sriously ranking would actually have a reason to Play it. 
---
People will still Queue AV all the time because there is always People that Need to farm the Reputation for the rewards.
---
Also we have crossrealm BG's there will never be a Point where there isn't enough People for AV....
---
Well with premade AV meta most top earners are getting around 16-18k honor per hour maybe even more depending on the hour of the day
---
This sounds like a job for.... DKP!
---
Level 30 Vs 60 isn't PvP it's pve
---
That is a Killer choice for a song! Happy to see someone else remembers Twinsanity as well

being spun out into the wee hours is a great thing

the problem arises when youre spun out in to the next day... or more
---
Its all about standard. Telling people about your 200k house would be bragging when talking to folks who barely make their rent, but try that in a yacht club and they will look at you like youre poor.   
---
Same works for (not) having game. If someone has the social skills of a rotten potato and thinks everyone in a certain group is the same in that regard, they will see even the slightest possible success with the opposite gender as bragging. So basically its projecting.
---
The bad mages get themselves killed. The bad hunters get us all killed. Mages bring water. Hunters ask if they can bum some meat for their pet off you. Mages can polymorph indefinitely, hunters can trap once for 20 seconds or something. Mages never touch my warrior loot, hunters need lots of the same rings, necks and trinkets. Mages stay quiet if i ask them to do something, or change their play, Hunters say "oh, didn't know that. Thanks!".

I generally flip a coin on who i want to bring more.

Guild:  &lt;Oblivion&gt;

Guild Type:  Semi-Hardcore
---
About Us: We are a growing and thriving community of seasoned WoW players whom miraculously found each other through the initial launch weeks of Classic. Founded in week 3, we have been tediously grooming and growing our own community from the ground up. All of our members that we have met along the way have one thing in mind: To be apart of a permanent home able to both provide exquisite competitive gameplay and have an excellent community to thrive in from launch until the end of Naxxramas. The majority of us are the total "Dad-Core" stereotype and there's nothing wrong with that. Sure we work out 9-5's and play casually on most weekdays and weekends, but when it's Tuesday/Wednesday night you better believe we are in that raid content giving it 110% and getting business done. We're not the first guild to clear content sure, but our superior planning and organizational skills mixed with our member's ability sure get's work done quick. We have been 10/10 MC &amp; 1/1 Ony since the end of Week 3, and we haven't skipped a beat since. We're looking for a few more mature players ready to get into Blackwing Lair with us and more importantly build a home worth living in until what ever Blizzard brings to us next.
---
Loot: EPGP
---
Days/Times: Tuesday and Wednesday from 8:00PM Server to 11:00PM Server. Bonus/Alt raids Friday
---
Requirements: If you are looking to raid with us immediately you should be level 60 with at least 75% of your pre-BiS farmed out. If you are just seeking general membership or PVP focus just be sure you're an all around good human. 
---
Looking For: We're currently looking to recruit 1 Holy Paladin, 1-2 Fury Warriors for our Main Raid. We're also always looking out for any competitive players of impeccable skill who would fit in with our growing community. 
---
Contact: Just shoot me a message on discord, Barracuda#8089 I'd love to answer any and all questions you may have.
---
Grab some superiors. I also keep sone greater around for trash. Majors for a few of the bosses where it's important like Garr/Domo/Golemagg/Rag
---
Please dont chase it and lose your mind like i have...
---
Then I don't understand how doing low dps would help his cause
---
DME, Mage does lashers &gt; satyrs. Lock does jump run bosses. It's the same as both of you doing separate runs but you're doing it in the same instance because you're buddies and like to have fun near each other. Mage needs herb and lock needs mining to maximise GPH.
---
Thanks m8! I thought about that too but it is either giving the sword back to the guild or using it...
---
I won't sell it since I asked for it for my Rogue when I was playing my druid and got it for free. I would feel like I just stole it from the guild :D
---
I think you forgot to put your feet into a small water bowl. Stay strong.
---
You're seeing stuff too black and white.
---
I can assure you, if a warrior in your guild runs around in a lvl 48 green ring of the bear and waits for Band of Accuria or Quick Strike Ring to drop and not farm some gear in the mean time, there will be discontented people.
---
I agree that not everybody needs to farm 300 runs for Savage Gladiator Chain to not drop, but people will be annoyed to carry 60s who have been 60 for months who still run around in lvl 50 leveling gear.
---
You got it right, three people so far whooshed
---
I mean you are wrong, leveling is fine now
---
Thank you. Do you happen to have an example for said script?
---
Don't go to plaguelands, it's where all the horde goes during queues.
---
could you do an elemental vs dense sharpening stone write-up?
---
Yeah it's good fun taking and healing simultaneously whilst dps run past
---
Getting Rhok'delar is actually very, very difficult without cheesing encounters by using friends and lots of items and abusing mechanics as much as possible. You don't just "walk out" with it, it takes weeks, and you could spend hours tracking one demon for one attempt, not taking into account other hunters competing for the spawn and clearing mobs around it.
---
guy threw a snowball and we just happened to lose right as it hit vann.. wasn't really why we lost obviously lol.
---
Is it 100% confirmed?
---
Might be some fuckery involved considering what patch we play on.
---
It’s a bug because you couldn’t do this in vanilla.
---
It's peanut butter jelly time
---
LOL loved the osrs prayer edit
---
So would It be better to bring a lvl 30 to SM Cath, than just 4 manning it with 4 43s for example?
---
Keep in mind guilds that put their logs up on warcraftlogs generally are doing so because they are not casual, but looking to improve. If most of your members are parsing 10%, I would not particularly want to upload my logs publicly.
---
Pvp
---
Which mobs? I'd be happy to run around farming guards for gold
---
Just get blessing of salvation. It is Easy :)
---
Hmm that's really interesting! Thanks for clarifying, that's good information.
---
Don't make the same mistake as i did. I tried too much weight to train my back muscles. Now i'm injured and back tot wow all day.
---
AV is 51-60.
---
It's good for PvP healer.
---
We have 2 Arms Warriors in our raid and they are always on the top 2. Being PvP spec isn't always so bad.
---
Who's "you"? There are definitely guilds that can clear it in pre-BIS gear, though they won't because they'll be decked out in MC and potentially R12-14 gear depending on when BWL comes out.
---
A dad guild will struggle for sure but it should still be doable. You'd still want a well geared tank, some stuff can hit pretty hard.
---
What are these que times you talk about?
---
The green minimap is probalby caused by SexyMap, try disabling it/tweaking its settings.
---
Aside from the ones already mentioned in other comments:
---
- You could probably get rid of ClassicThreatMeter if you have Details, since Details has its own threat meter (TinyThreat).
---
- I believe Titan Panel has its own XP module, so maybe you could also get rid of XToLevel.
---
- ClassicCastbars and Quartz are both casting bar addons, might be redundant. Pick one.
---
Don't.
---
Not only is enh shaman a meme, but the reason its a meme is the fact that the kit is just undeveloped. Do you want to literally auto attack while changing totems and ocassionally casting a frostshock? Shit is the most boring thing in the game why would you want to play it?
---
Yes, if you have only 300 weapon skill then that is the largest factor. If you can't afford Edgemaster's right now you can get the Expert Goldminer's Helmet which is a BoE with +axe skill. Orc is a better choice for DPS warriors but no need to delete your troll.
---
Damn
---
Flask +pots +runes is more than all dps consumes cost. Speed running just makes it worse...
---
Wait wtf. There's so many things to fix in Classic, and *that's* what they're spending time on ?
---
I really like your style dude! It's very unique, at least I haven't seen anything like it!
---
The hunter in the end is 100% a bot using click to move.
---
If it starts with,  my friend / uncle / someone i know, works at Blizzard , its Fake.  
---
Always....
---
Leveling a warrior is fine if you just tank dungeons or buy him gear. It’s only kinda bad from levels 30+ to solo at which point if you get him a WW axe it’s pretty easy. I just leveled mine to BRD levels and I lived in SM and then ZF from 30-50 but I had so much fun 2H tanking it because how you react to the pulls is dynamic and if you play with a Shaman it’s a ton of fun doing 70% of the group damage on some pulls. It takes some getting used to but having to decide when to put on a shield/ sit in d-stance is way better than “hopefully my next auto procs windfury.”
---
I think it's a lot more fun to get the best gear for doing the hardest activities in the game or being better than other players. It's a lot less interesting for half your gear to be purchased with gold or dropped in a trivial encounter or simply a reward for logging in all day.
---
I'd like to think too, it's not late to reroll anything. We still got 1/2 years of content left. Plenty of time to raid and gear different classes!
---
When he says "X damage is higher/lower than Y damage at Z value" it's almost always wrong according to the graphs he provides. 
---
That or I can't read a graph properly.
---
BWL is much harder than MC, but still it should not be that hard. Sure if your whole raid is in pre-raid bis, you might have bad time, but otherwise it should doable.
---
In truth. 
---
Nobody doesnt really know how hard Classic BWL will be.
---
We do know that even in old Vanilla days MC was puggable, but all BWL pug raids died to second boss.
---
Livejournal shut down years ago iirc.
---
That is also MikScrollingBattleText.
---
You probably joined a guild that already cleared it, or was initially composed of experienced players? Most casual guilds spent a few weeks being unable to kill it, and the first kill or two could easily be post-submerge.
---
Blizzard completely fucked up the Pvp aspect with classic, nobody playing classic has actually gotten the real vanilla pvp experience and the only aspect that has been succesfull is the pve part.
---
We got the servers are 5 times more populated world pvp zerg fest and crossrealms with russians BG, that is NOT vanilla, crossrealm BGs also completely killed pvp back in vanilla.
---
Ok so use your map. North south west east. Where Ony is tanked is the north side of the room. When she does breath it goes straight from where she's flying. So if she's either directly south or north the safe zones are west and east. If she's in a corner like north west. The safe zones are north east south west. Take the map and basically cut it into four equal pieces.
---
Keep in mind he may simply not sell them. Making for yourself or guild is common
---
Sounds like the other person is calling out the safe spots to stand, which is really all anyone needs to hear. Keep it simple, keep it concise. You should ping the safe spots as well, not Ony.
---
Have you done BWL recently because the fights really aren’t that long in 1.12 with people gearing properly. Onyxia is technically a long fight if you 20 man it but you still don’t even need mp5 because consumes and MTT cover you. I honestly just collect mp5 gear for trash and put on full SP for bosses. BWL is going to be much the same. I don’t know if I’ll even stack mp5 for Nef. There actually isn’t even that much damage to heal.
---
Very Fun.  
---
And shit im bad at this.... and i tough i was a lore master O\_o
---
At the start druid T1 tried to do everything, like [this](https://itemization.info/item/16828), but eventually they just made it all healer gear.

What's the benefit in giving a Tank a Deathbringer/Viskag when you can give that to a dps and give the Tank a CHT?
---
CHT will be way more effective for the tank, remember fast weapons also provide better rage generation. For example our MT is currently using Eskhandar's Right Claw for threat and it's working wonders even factoring in the lower weapon skill.
---
The hardest boss is killing all goblins in Vael's room.
---
That's insanely lucky, we got 1 mageblade, 2 staffs, 2 perd, 1 oeb
---
hey mate, thnks a lot for going through all this effort! I already started reading it :)
---
So far I noticed two mistakes in chapter 3.2.1:
---
1) while the miss chance is 8%, Bossmobs also ignore the first 1% hit at 11+ difference Weqpon skill/atk skill, making the effective hit cap be 9%.
---
2) the miss formula is calculated in percent, so it would be 5 + (tlvl*5 - atk) * 0.2 which would result in 5% + 3% = 8%, instead you wrote 0.05 which is already converted from percent to fraction.
---
keep up the good work!
---
I have raided all content in vanilla and tbc and end game content is harder in Vanilla as Naxx&gt;sunwell easily tho mechanics of the bosses are harder in sunwell but overall experience nothing beats Naxx nothing that has ever been released to this today it is the most energy consuming raid Ive done.
---
But early tbc&gt;vanilla by far, tempest keep and ssc are just amazing. Black tempel and Mount Hyial are TBCs versions of molten core, they're piss easy and boring.
---
Well p2 is out and that would be at the 10 month mark by that metric
---
Boss dies, checks loot : ”Yeah, no it’s just all druid loot again.”
---
&gt; Dude there are a large number of guilds still doing 6+ minute Rag kills
---
dont know man, 40 guilds out of 7246 isn't that large of a number
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000/#boss=672&amp;page=145
---
Lol cute
---
I guess what I'm saying is someone who knows about the uploader/combatlog/how parsing works would probably not be in a casual guild where each guild member has to be in the bottom 10-30% of their class in performance to make a 6+ minute rag possible. I'm in a semi casual guild that has been raiding since a month or so since launch but just last week our first log went up on warcraftlogs publicly. We don't generally see submerge 90% of the time unless we're not running a full 40, but we didn't want our members to be shamed by other guilds/players for poor parses so we uploaded unlisted.
---
DPS warrior in my guild decided to level a Druid alt, he’s almost full T1 now, after.. what, three weeks? Maybe less.
---
Basically whenever H&amp;A push each other back and forth in the road to SP gy.
---
A cant even summon Ivus in response because druids will just get killed in the zerg.
---
Question 22 is incorrect, &gt;!you can find Nagas in Arathi highland.!&lt;
---
That doesnt make it any better tho.I leveld together with a friend he was always like "Yeah lets kill this dude who try to solo Quest" and i was like "Yeah no problem go kill him, i WONT help u cause 2vs1 is not a fair fight" But atleast he see it coming when a Shadowpriest is running to him and he is kind of prepared for the fight, thats what i was saying. Rogues coming out of nowhere while u quest is not nice...
---
In my opinion I guess we are more likely to do this because of the instant queue and I hate it.
---
People don’t give a fuck because they know that if they leave they would still have a shorter queue than horde.
---
I always see horde play like they want to get everything they can out of AV because they wait that long. And alliance gets over fed with queue invites.
---
I’m sure someone has finished postmaster. 
---
There was a post 5 days after wsg was released that showed someone as exalted. A human Paladin iirc.
---
Don’t know about hks.
---
Because classic is pure vanilla right?
---
\&gt;The dots represent an ability usage. Immediately, we notice that Slam is utilized much more *frequently* than Execute due to the fact that we can activate it effectively midway through our swing, while we can only Execute immediately after it. Moreover, the large auto attack damage resulting from a two handed weapon swing also results in more rage, which as we’ve seen further reduces it’s DPR. We know, however, that DPR and Damage are not proportional. Therefore, under the same circumstances, let’s look at the damage dealt in the same time interval:
---
This is wrong. Or at least, it's wrong if you intend to do good damage. To use slam you need a start-attack macro, and even then it will still reset your attack timer. The optimal use of abilities in the execute phase for two-handed warriors is something like AA-&gt;Bloodthirst-&gt;execute, or AA-&gt;slam-&gt;execute depending on the amount of rage you gain on hit. That covers 3 seconds in gcds and cast time. 3 secs fits in a 3.4 auto-attack, but not with flurry uptime.
---
Because of how slam behaves, you should never use it more than once per auto-attack cycle, and always \*immediately\* after the auto-attack lands.
---
1 - ( ( 1 - .5 ) ^ 13) — go plug that equation into WolframAlpha. It’s a probability equation which tells us that OP has had, statistically, the probability chance of 99.987% to have seen the eye to drop, or this is something that would happen to .013% of the population to have had to not seen a 50% drop ratio item come out in 13 runs of that boss.
---
He has 12 heroic strike casts, and you have 0. 
---
If you're a DPS warrior - you NEED at least +5 weapon skill (better +7 or +8, but not more), so for a troll it's either Edgemasters, mugger's belt or Aged core leather gloves (and then go daggers).
---
If you have Edgemasters and use heroic strike queueing - you can drop your hit to 6%, replace the rest with crit/attack power and still have like 5% misses, resulting in more rage and more DPS, blowing other DPS warriors out of the water.
---
Devilsaur and Black Dragonscale will always be in high demand. But it is not worth it being yet another leatherworker on server.
---
I am a level 56 mage and getting a bit tired with BRD. Are there any other dungeons where I would be able to join as a lvl 56 with good drops for mages? I was thinking of Stratholme and Scholomance, but I’m not sure... Thanks!
---
Sadly none of those sets are worth anything for resto/ele. Look up Egregious's guides.
---
You can do lbrs and DME.
---
I'm a hunter struggling with the  Winterspring demon for the epic quest chain. According to the guides I just have to keep serpent sting up and hit him with arcane shot rank 1.
---
But even with cheetah he is just faster than me and is always catching up to me. Any tipps?
---
Rght Claw for MH, and Core hound Tooth Dagger for Off Hand is Treath wise very good, no matter of your race, im currently using it as an Orc, and almost nobody out threats you anymore.
---
F
---
I've farmed them for roughly 16 hours with an average income of about 4g per hour. Ofcourse i didn't get a drop, but it's a very unreliable farm
---
Alliance EU here, out of all the games to get exalted I lost 2 matches.
---
&gt; I thought 9% was minimum to not miss yellow hits.
---
Yes, with 300 weapon skill. With 305+ it's 6% (and also your glancing white hits deal more damage).
---
this is me
---
Yes, it was late 2 months ago and it is late now. The need for tanks is way too small in raids compared to dungeons. Basically all the raids are setup and the tank positions all taken for a very long time. In many cases it was taken even before classic started, as lot of ppl are veternas from the retail. I even heard stories from friends of tank being not that good, but the GM not being willing to switch him with someone more skilled, because they are friends, and they went through a lot to gether etc. Very often, then main tank spot is also the GM, as one of the main motivations to go through all of the trouble of creating a guild is to get a MT spot.  
---
You can check it yourselves, try to watch the ONY/MC/Guild public invs in public channels. Count how many times ppl search for dps/healers and how many times they search for tank. (They never search for tank)
---
So, the best chance of getting a MT is to spend a ALOT of time trying to form a guild, but in this phase, it will be very hard.
---
This is generally the main design flaw of vanilla, going through dungeons as non-tank is pain at times, as finding tank is often hard, so a lot of ppl might be motivated ted reroll as a tank just to find out, that once it switches to raids, they are suddenly too many tanks.
---
Clearly you are too stupid to put two and two together.
---
They already have made an edit to change the variables for AV raid groups and their loot that cannot be changed by players in game.
---
This exists and does everything that would be beneficial to all parties.
---
I’m not sure if you are really this stupid or just another troll.
---
I might look into that, I will probably drop skinning as it doesn’t really supplement my gold farming right now. Thanks!
---
Tank benefits from deathbringer by being orc, and not having to use edgies/ACLG. Similar story with humans for vis'kag. They also obviously benefit from the higher raw DPS on them.  
---
Faster weapons do not generate *more* rage, they only generate it more smoothly. Slow weapons dump rage more effectively (despite the higher cost, they still have higher threat-per-rage when HS'ing than fast weapons, due to how yellows can't glancing blow). CHT is not a better weapon than the other options for threat, until you hit so hard, and get hit so hard that you can't spend your rage. THAT is when you want to get faster weapons. No extra threat on QS, but the mitigation and stam there is indeed nice.   
---
The weapons off onyxia are tank BiS for threat for their respective races, but you can definitely make the argument that a guild is better served by giving those to the DPS.
---
Yeh, now we just need them to update combuctor.
---
Yes, Officer. This post right here.
---
there's a backdoor now? I'm still levelling in classic and was dreading the 12 hour stand offs av would have on that damn bridge,  I'd go work come home, have dinner settle down and the same game would be playing on that bridge.  
---
but there's another way you say?
---
I enjoyed the vid. 
---
What Addon is it for floating health bars?
---
AV is nothing like you remember. Games last 6-8 mins or max like 45 mins.
---
its all fun and games until someone from a different server whispers you.
---
Nothing I hate more than when I throw a renew on a 100% health 25% mana Warlock and he does absolutely nothing. Start life tapping my dude!
---
I’m happy for the horde queues, they deserve it!
---
Just be careful with the neutral AH. Isn't there bots actively trying to swipe these type of auctions?
---
How much gold per hour?
---
I leveled my bank alt to 60 for no reason and had not heard about those demons before. One guildie gave me a summary and I downed all of them within two tries. Classic is not hard but it was a fun little challenge that checked if I knew my class  or not
---
I mean, no av is out the unstoppable force is a reasonable alternative to raiding.
---
I'm on my 10th consecutive MC run without seeing might shoulders, who are to be mine... And I am close to 30 Rend runs, never saw valor drop even once. Rocking Wyrmhide shoulder for pvp/tank since level 50 :)
---
How does this work? Inviting the person who wants it and then? Do they need to be in the instance for handing out?
---
Tidi di,
---
Tidi didi diii
---
Question 37 is incorrect for vanilla/classic - the goblin doesn’t drop a book, you need to MC him.
---
Rift went free bcs sub numbers were so low it died.
---
Dont rogues only have access to +5 swords in talents, so daggers rogues will need the gloves? Not a rogue so correct me if im wrong.
---
You know the campfires are for cooking and the buff is just extra right?
---
Wow Classic+ please. Give finished Azshara and put a raid there, Karazhan level 60 (wich should already existed in vanilla hence the summon to Karazhan on Atiesh staff), Uldum (also planned to vanilla) but reformed to better fit the vanilla theme and put a raid there, implement arenas and probably find a way of implement tbc talents and specs.
---
The horde meta is you encourage everyone to kill the NPCS while low key you're in middle farming alliance.
---
&gt;   I don't personally remember ever killing him pre-submerge in vanilla.
---
Yeah, I clearly remember the submerge was the hard part, getting to phase three where he emerges again was the major blocker every guild had. We had BWL on farm for a while before we approached this idea we might be able to do him before submerge but noone really believed it and I don't think we gave it a serious shot.
---
With a million players raiding statistically there should be three regular raid groups that have had that happen. With three hunters per raid, that's 9 very unhappy hunters. In vanilla my guild didn't get the rogue hat from Onyxia for 30+ weeks, 0.4% chance of that happening to any class, in other words 4000 unhappy people per million raiders.
---
This is why time gated random loot is considered bad game design today, you are guaranteed to create a bunch of very unhappy customers.
---
When did you do this though. Because I have gone to the AoE spots etc in wetlands and so on and there has been 0 mages there. I will also mainly be playing off peak times which should be okay
---
I just don’t know what the answer is lol I can eat my own food but that slows us down. If I life tap, the healer can toss me a heal and we can pull while healer is resting instead of both of us
---
Never a bad idea to start pertinent fights with Flametongue instead of windfury to avoid exactly this
---
If you have bound the key anywhere the Macro ignores it, maybe thats the reason
---
that's pretty crazy what does his work require just sitting there doing nothing for 8 hours?
---
lol what?
---
What was the source of the angry woman at the end?
---
I'm feral tank, from 2 Mc runs and an ony run, I have my t2 head and 6 pieces of cenarion
---
Yep and melee just gets stronger with gear better scaling than spellcasters and rest.Which is why them getting easy UBF with nerfed AV(who shouldnt be in this phase) is bonkers
---
Few days after launch yeah, so it might actually not be that bad anymore now when I think about it yeah...
---
This is most likely (99.9%) your problem. 
---
Try to run in a straight line. When you have to transition from the snow, to the road, try not to cut the corner too much and make a gradual turn so that the demon doesn't catch you by cutting the corner. 
---
It's very straight forward like you say, aspect of cheetah, rank 1 arcane to keep aggro, serpent sting up the whole time, and stay at max range. If he get's too close, concussion shot is also alright.
---
The only consumable that you would potentially need would be a mana potion. Not even a major mana potion would be needed but just one to give you that little last you might need.
---
Good luck!
---
Choose a different skin for sexy map.
---
Casual players are playing less, but overall it's still quite active and will definitely see large spikes with every phase launch.
---
Ok so I have a conundrum here. I’m a lock and was doing BRD at 58. I feel guilty because I’m life tapping, making the healer feel obligated to heal me. If I don’t life tap, I have to drink water and slow the group down because there’s at least 2 of us drinking between pills now instead of just the healer (or other mages). 
---
So what’s the right call here? Am I a dick if I life tap and get heals from the healer or should I be eating and drinking myself?
---
Oh lol yeah. First month of launch will be a shit show... Which is why I waited until now to level my mage as I want to do it faster than normal which ofc is AoE grinding
---
The difference between a 3 hour clear and a half hour clear is just consuming.  Sure anyone can clear the content, but anyone can farm gold too.  Efficiency is King imo.
---
Healer here. Don't mind it at all once we can keep the group moving. I'd normally Rejuv and Regrowth the lock when I see mana is low so they can LT
---

Ive heard both sides on reddit, my biggest concern with TBC is gear is basically replaced with blues/greens. Thats my biggest gripe with retail right now.
---
I got really lucky. I went to farm eye of shadow with a guildie (hunter) he kited the demons/had his pet tank. On the 2nd pull the eye of shadow dropped. This is when the eye was going for 600g. I got really really lucky
---
Also this. I remember people who based their experience on vanilla telling me that there was no way in hell I could forgo heavy fire resist, to the tune of 100 unbuffed for raggy.
---
That's just not the case.
---
Oh my, the comments on the original post paint a whole different story.
---
What I usually do is group up with a healing partner and reserve all the orbs, then split them between you 2. Partners in crime
---
Destroyed them at 60s as well but now everyone has at least UBF a MC quality weapon so they huurt.And locks could never peel them off. Only way is to spec Soullink it seems
---
I was at the same boat as you  then I just take a break starting on important quest such as onyxia attunement, nathonas brightcaller quest and the ungoro spell power off hand.
---
Haha
---
You can be an offtank probably.
---
Yeah but not by you lol
---
This. 
---
My mage with herb, friends lock with mining, we can clear most of DME between us, and has worked out pretty profitable for us.
---
Been using it for a while but havent seen the link he was talking about, unfortunately its exactly the thing I have been looking for because OTs want to be fury/prot due to the QOL it brings.
---
it's 2019, not 2002. we have software to do everything at a single fingertip.
---
Its better than Obisdian edge for pvp and can almost match rag weapons.Great proc and great high end damage
---
I assume you're using:
---
/cast Heroic Strike; \[mod:shift\] Cleave
---
Like the other reply, if the keybind is set somewhere else, the macro won't work. It won't be the SHIFT that's bound, but something like SHIFT+3 (I have HS on keybind 3; so I'll use that number).

We are a guild that has existed since Vanilla. Our previous standards were registered as chill but serious. We still will have a fun atmosphere to play the game in, however with the upcoming release of BWL we are shifting the guild atmosphere to a higher standard of accountability. We are also intolerant to drama on every level. We respect everyone’s time and will hold those raiding to the same standards. We are currently carried by a strong core leadership that will ensure and aid in preparedness. Our current needs may be found below.

thats prty of you man
---
The greens from dmt are bop
---
Yeah those where before Horde realized a full zerg on both sides favors alliance and lost all games. Now they adapted and defend too. Alliance still needs to figure out how that works though, defending. So PuG vs PuG we only loose as horde when the group does not cooperate and actually defends really.
---
Figured out that one of the maps in the sexymap that I could use was the cause of me getting a green layer, so change it to one that did not give me one
---
Oh Mograine ?Nice nice
---
P1 is an incredibly low content phase once leveling is complete,  also the timeline was nearly in line with the actual release during vanilla which is the timeline that blizz said they wanted to follow with a bit of extra time for naxx this time around.  There is zero reason to think blizzard classic team which has been pretty open and honest won't follow through with their 18 to 24 month plan like they have stated
---
&gt; The world boss system in classic is the biggest waste of coding I’ve ever seen 
---
Can you elaborate what you meam with "waste of coding" ?
---
Warlocks tapping to capped mana then just standing right beside me with 5% hp. Death it is my friend
---
If you can't understand the reason it's easier for people to do it like this, after it's been explainednkn threada 500 times, then there is little hope for your 2 remaining brain cells.
---
I really hope that their isnt a mage here that just leveled by using frostbolt :S
---
time to make keyboard macro that goes in general direction of horde on 30 sec loop
---
Using the only viable source that we have ( shadowpanther ) zeal comes on top with a difference akin to having 5 agility more ( that alone tells you how small the difference is ). While krol has passive stats, zeal has a proc with a ridiculous proc rate and gives 10 flat damage. Add in the fact that sword of zeal is usually about half the price of krol blade its better to get zeal.
---
What is happening here?
---
He's level 60 .. why would he CoC ZF when he can Blizzard? Which he needs practice on because he's never done it. Hence, go to WPL and test it out instead of getting your ass kicked in ZF.
---
Cringe
---
They do get summoned frequently. I'm not saying they're winning matches or anything, but they can be used to push turtles, and Icelord is better at that. Everything else I mentioned has bigger impact.
---
I honestly dont think another realm will server you better.  
---
Majority of the players are 60 already
---
half of horde population is getting carried by op racials

Oh dear Lord

Happened to me when I joined a new guild in MC back in vanilla. They somehow only had one other rogue who had been with them a while and had everything he needed, I had 2 pieces of nightslayer from my previous guild but little else. Sure enough my first Mc run w/ the new guild I got 3-4 other pieces I needed in one night.
---
Been raining caster loot for 4 weeks, but between 5 mages and 4 warlocks, I am yet to win a roll on a single piece. Every warlock tier armor went to other locks, and every trinket, ring or other generic caster item went to mages. Such is life in a RNG loot guild.
---
I don't know a single warrior who doesn't use the gloves for PvP, maybe I'm just playing with some high class warriors but dad don't tell them that their heads might e explode...
---
yes commander/lt, returjing wing commanders to base and burning towes is given out right away unlike mine capture honor that is at the end of the battle
---
Call the cops!
---
Yeah that’s like the first rule of starting lifting weights. Start light and work your way up. If you look around at the gym and compare how much you’re lifting to everyone else you’re doing it wrong and will probably hurt yourself
---
Well he asked!
---
Summoned him few times and it was always a win but what  infuriates me is when horde doesn't wanna summon him and loses.. needing 10 ppl is bit too much but so many pass him buy
---
Nice.
---
With the current Honor meta and AV farm, i dont think 12 hours is enough.  
---
you'll need alot more, to even reach 13 i think.  
---
Yeah reaching R14 can be considered an Achievement, but it comes with depression and PTSS
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/lmWlfZI](https://imgur.com/a/lmWlfZI)  damage meter and threat meter is hidden when I'm not grouped.
---
We had one of those, many laughs were had by all, but then he suddenly rage quit the raid. Turns out he was using earth shock all the time and it was his own fault, but was seething at the tanks being so bad.
---
Our bad for misjudging how he felt about it, his bad for being shit at being enhancement shaman.
---
He later reappeared to send his gold off to a guildie then deleted his character. I think it was for the best.
---
Why...why go that way .ouch
---
If vanilla is fillet mignon what are vegans /s
---
You can‘t queue toggle mh. You can only actually hs mh.
---
A lot did afk. There was some resistance but i say at least 15-25 people total went afk from alliance side
---
Hes using anvil in SS cause TM doesn't have one
---
As a druid that tanks. Quite often I cancel form and throw a few heals on the lock. It's not like I need mana and if the healer doesn't need to heal them then we can get going faster
---
I think that's what they just did.
---
full sunders and a curse of recklessness on top.
---
We queue with 40 people and get 37-38 people in constantly. 40 if idiots click portals.
---
im calling the police
---
Haha this is great.
---
It’s not as much of a cakewalk, but the mechanics are pretty simple and once you’re geared it’ll get fairly easy like MC did. 
---
AQ40 is where the challenge starts and is where my vanilla guild started to crack because the casual members hated repeated wipes.
---
Also cropped like ass.
---
Meanwhile Warriors are lucky to even get a few pieces of T1.
---
Can't say no if your sapped
---
They fixed it in an expansion I just don't remember which.
---
Yes, it would be helpful to see the other healers Mana bars in raids.
---
Only if you're ok with healing at 60. Of tou want to melee dps then be a rogue.
---
You queue with „only“ 40 People and get 37-38 in? Horde or Alliance?
---
Are you using an adobe that synchronises the queue?
---
It seems hard to believe tbh because I have heard of discord’s with 60+ people only getting 30 in
---
Still no Modelchange for Classic yet. It was taken down because of some chinese assholes exploiting it.
---
First couple of weeks?
---
It doesnt seem like you know what afk means, afk = away from keyboard and last i checked i couldnt fish while i was away from my keyboard so please tell me how this is done
---
That's a lot of white noise on that mic, might wanna look into that, sounded like a rainstorm going on lol
---
Was just questing in the undead zone in classic and did the quests where you concoct different torturous poisons on alliance prisoners who then turn into undead abominations.
---
What named mobs? I am new to AV, sorry.
---
Fishing is a good one, especially since you already have mining. At 300 you can learn the route to check for Pools of Elemental Water in Azshara, and also check for the underwater Rich Thorium Veins along the way. On a populated server there will always be competition out there, but even if the route's down you can still open-water fish in the Bay of Storms for Winter Squid which sell pretty well right now, and if you keep some on a bank alt they're going to skyrocket in price next summer when you can't fish them anymore (especially if AQ comes out around then).
---
Leveling fishing from 1 is a pain, but just remember the time you spend leveling it will pale in comparison to the time you spend fishing at max level. Get the Fishingbuddy addon so you can fish with just your mouse and sound cues, and you can watch Netflix/Youtube/whatever on your phone or another monitor and make gold at the same time.
---
Seems pretty accurate :)
---
UBF?
---
That was quite the trip you took. lol
---
So you think it's a good strat? Go straight for Drek, skipping Galv and gy's on the way? We should capture the flag near Drek first tho, right?
---
I don't get what I'm supposed to be looking at.
---
Or just spend 5 seconds googling "blue tracker" rather than making s stupid comment.
---
He didn't abuse layering until the last couple of levels
---
this hurt a little.
---
You don't. 
---
Zug Zug.
---
I don't think these items are worth saving. Nexus Crystals are gonna worth nothing.
---
and my guild has gotten 2 eyes and zero ingots and we have been raiding for at least 8-10 weeks at this point about to start alt raids.
---
We didn’t really adapt to the zerg, letting Alliance win was more efficient when the queue time was &lt;3 mins. Now that the queue times are up it’s more efficient to win.
---
Haha sometimes I throw it down after killing someone in world pvp to scare them like I'm still around waiting for them to res even though I move along, but I think most people don't even know what it does because it's used so little lol
---
Yeah got some proof of that? Because it's funny how everyone else get a error message saying "Please select a different realm." when trying to transfer from PvE to PvP. Just tried it myself to check.
---
I can't sit around grinding 1.5 million honor a week
---
Farm lashers in DM, i struggled with ZF aswell. In DM, i did an easy 40g an hour and you can do it naked, i often forgot to gear up again after i stripped down and died at the end.

I saw him once and it was awesome.. 20 horde with their Ice Lord and 20 alliance with their Forest Boy met in the middle. It looked like the Giants were fighting  but they were really standing next across while slaughtering players.
---
Forest Boy died and horde went on to win
---
Does anyone have a video showing the satisfaction of this happening? Never witnessed it before.
---
always 2 their are, no more no less.
---
Would be correct id the zeal proc was rare, buts its insane and makes it better than krol.
---
Atleast according to every test made.
---
They really don’t seem to like you for some reason lol
---
I really enjoy the dancing flute. If people aren’t paying attention, you can break them off a node
---
If you're talking about morphing programs, there are some out there that work perfectly.
---
discord.gg/avpremade
---
Diamond flask is great on private servers because, just like battlechicken, the effect lasts over 30 sec. You use them, then swap to your "proper" trinkets before pull.
---
Well...
---
*gestures vaguely at all of BFA*
---
I’m a feral druid, OT, for my raid. I’ve been sitting on full tier gear for weeks now since my guild only uses 1 other druid (resto). I almost feel bad since there’s so many people still needing tier gear and I have a full set I never touch but then I remember my main spec has hardly any raid gear and realistically I’m in the same boat
---
Our Warrior got it after 150 runs. I feel ya!
---
What a beautiful story &lt;3
---
I was considering just going Resto for this very reason.  2 weeks in MC as a feral tank and I have 4 pieces of tier gear lol.
---
We're at the point where we're giving the leaf to alts now. Although we do MC twice a week.
---
the record part is the time of the bg, not score btw... fucks give on kills...
---
I an not even going to argue. I am more interested in hearing you explanation so l can laugh at it. Common, tell me why?
---
Not as good as “The two ring”
---
I am not in the business of getting bullied by a weeb that thinks a dft is as rare as a tf. Instead, I will just put you on my block list.
---
You can enjoy playing your 14% hit warrior.
---
As an addon to this, you can farm graveyards starting at 44ish solo. Cone of Cold kiting is a bit slow but the exp is ridiculous.
---
stop using logic!
---
I’ve been in pugs, they are always 3hrs+
---
13 MC clears and never seen Vendorstrike drop once LOL
---
This was over a plague bloom node lol. He came from one direction I another and he got the aggro. I  didnt see a guy fighting on a node an take it from him. Although the responses I got here kind of proved my point about the community. Good luck out there have fun!
---
To be fair though, the off hands are incredibly good and will last us through AQ.
---
yes the quests are still available
---
I did 65 runs and this was the easiest
---
Resets are on set days, not X amount of days after you clear them.
---
There no more wpvp what you mean
---
Type in google: Onyxia reset wow classic.
---
It has it's charm
---
Far superior to everything being randomly rolled
---
Yep. From my experience, all semi-hardcore means is watch a detailed guide on all boss mechanics before you start clearing a new tier so you don't die in a super dumb way, and loot is distributed with LC.
---
In the first few days of AV you could do multiple AVs without killing a single player, especially if you were Alliance.

&gt;Oh boy, a piece of coal on the AH for 50g!  
---

---
Well, a warlock who is able to lifetap will significantly speed up dungeon clear speed. However they should bring heavy runecloth bandages and not rely only on the healer.
---
Disclaimer: All of this is with the assumption that you/your guild is okay with you not being completely min/maxed.
---
Regarding the voracity enchants, don't put them on T2, you'll be running full T1 soon and your T2 will "rot" in your bank untill you have 8 pieces.
---
Regarding the scope, if you farm tribute for money (and as such are deep surv for imp fd) I'd skip it and use +7 dmg as picking up those 3% isn't a problem.
---
How are you hit capping without'em?
---
Farming 3 hours to get a 30 minute run is hardly efficient though.
---
I would assume the overlap of guilds who log their raids and take 6+ minutes to kill Rag is quite small.
---
Its mc its not a hard raid. Use your gold how you like i know most in my guild aren't using consumable and we down 1 everything 1 shot
---
For me bagnon is working, but with some issues. For example, when you mouse over an item in the main bank bag, item\`s description will briefly appear what it is and then it is blank.  Several people, including me, opened the issue on GitHub, but developer closed it without explanation. There are also other serious issues submitted there.
---
I hope, bugs will be fixed soon, because this version is buggy as hell.  
---
Can anybody advise the best alternatives to bagnon? The most important feature of bagnon for me is a possibility to view bank any time &amp; view alt\`s inventory &amp; bank.
---
The amount of crit required for seal fate to match combat daggers in pure dps might be higher than 30%. I'm talking about the point that distracting dagger becomes the best choice as an offhand (even better than core hound tooth). 
---
Btw, you have 33% unbuffed *because* you're combat daggers - you get 5% free crit, which you lose when swapping into seal fate.
---
I mained a healer on retail and loved every second of it, but healing on Classic and spamming the same spell over and over with very little nuance takes the fun out of it imo. Different strokes for different folks I suppose
---
I have a question about stat weighting for Mages for PvE. [Here's my character to give an idea of my current gear.](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/mage/gnome/AjwPIwAFAB_wU1AiMSI1EFHwAUISAkLVA0GdBUGeBkrAB0ITCC4uCUGfCkGhCy4wDDD_DTKCDjaQD0K2EC4IEUtuEkqk)
---
I never picked up Tailoring and my luck on items such as [Boreal Mantle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11782/boreal-mantle) have been impossibly bad. Like, statistical anomaly/God laughing at me levels of bad. Due to this, I might end up with a 5-Piece T1 bonus when I either get [Arcanist Crown](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16795/arcanist-crown) or [Arcanist Boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16800/arcanist-boots).
---
The 5-Piece bonus is this:
---
&gt; Decreases the magical resistances of your spell targets by 10.
---
There's marginal PvP benefits here (tier 1 gear has decent stamina and all that anyways) but does reducing resistances have any appreciable PvE implications? I know that some raid bosses have resistance stats but I don't know how impactful this actually is.
---
Ignoring the whole "it's not BIS" argument, how much should 10 reduced resistance be weighted when selecting gear out of my available pool? Is it worthless, or is it worth +8 Spellpower or some nonsense? I never understood resistance math.
---
At 56 you should be fine for LBRS
---
Love it! Can’t wait to read more. Was very interesting to learn that execute should be used as early and often as possible. Sounds like a no-brainer but previously I was pooling rage prior to execute phase, even if I was in the execute phase.
---
LoL
---
lmao right I always think this at every dubious post here saying they have a ret pala or pvp specced player at top dps, just means your raid is garbage and you probably think 2+ hours is an acceptable speed to clear MC
---
Still, your average guild is not really going to be raiding more than 2, 3 nights top.
---
This is pvp
---
That's 2 of my guildies (loktar ogar)
---
If it was Wrath you would be casting Holy Light, as FoL became a fast, expensive big heal, and holy light became a slow but reasonably efficient big heal.
---
Idk why some healers dont like locks in their group.
---
You wanna tap down to 2 HP? Cool. I'll throw some heals your way if I got the mana/global. If you die it's on you.
---
Also if you play a lock and arent on the verge of death on almost every occasion you are doing it wrong.
---
He didn't really use layering until level 56 or 57, before that he would only layer away to avoid getting killed.
---
Yeah and while you are doing that you are totally participating to thé bg
---
Oh yeah the forsaken have always been fucked up but the rest of the hordes zones are mostly just trying to survive
---
I played 2 games before work and we destroyed the horde. Werushed galv, then drek. The main group just can't wipe, gotta stay together.
---
https://www.onyxiareset.com/
---
2 and a half hours is definitely enough to farm consumables for a speed clear in my case. But I do play warlock, so I have the luxury of a good gold farm (DME).
---
When you are going uphill he gains on you a little bit since he kind glides over the ground. So it could put you in range of his doom spell. 
---
I used one restorative potion cause there were a couple little blips in the terrain and one of them put me in range on my kill.
---
I'd recommend watching a guide on soloing ZF as a mage from level 44. It sounds way harder than it actually is. You get a very decent amount of gold and it's really good exp.
---
Those damn undeads throwing spiders on everyone. Not even Mordor is safe.
---
Are you from my guild? Because we won't stop getting Druid tier. Our two resto druids are 8/8 T1 2/8 T2 with our Bear and Boomkin having almost the same. It's absurd
---
There is durability loss from being in combat. However he is talking about the -10% loss from dying not being in BG's even from fall damage.
---
Step 1; get some friends, you can’t do anything in AV alone. Try to get 5 inc healer and someone with tank potential, hopefully a mage or 2 as well.
---
Now go balinda, make sure you type in capital letters and shit to go galv. If alliance kills galv before balinda then you get honor and rep, if horde kills balinda before that you get nothing. With your 5 dudes you will kill 9/10 horde balinda rushes and secure the galv kill for your team. Once you’ve done this wipe or escape, looting everything you can.
---
Regroup and check the map from SH gy. Recap any bunkers horde just took and look to take out some LTs and a tower for more honor, a goood group will leash the 3 horde LTs into galv and kill them after galv. You want to hold towers for 5 mins to destroy them and get more honor and also prevent horde from holding your bunkers and destroying them. You will probably have to use the AV trinket and port back as a group to recap the base bunkers and GY, also wipe any horde group easily with your superior coordination. Now Hand in at base for more rep.
---
Now you have been playing objectives and probably got more honor and rep than 90% of alliance games so you’ve already won. Laugh at the guys who want to rush drek and rely on taking the horde base GY, whilst you do this ho and kill the remaining LTs and take the GY outside of the horde base, defend it. 
---
And that really is all you can do, play the objectives and defend the horde backdoor cheese strats. Rushes do not work anymore for alliance. It’s that simple, you have to play the right objective at the right time and hope your brain dead ‘RuSH DRek’ team can actually kill drek after you setup a favourable situation 15-20 minutes into the match.
---
Oh god eu alliance are actual children
---
This was true at the start when everyone rushed. However recently AV has been heavily Horde favoured.
---
My friend Pedro
---
Herbalist for sure.
---
I would say mining if you can deal with 2 trackers. 
---
Enchanting if you are going to spend a bunch of time in dungeons while lvling. This is to DE all the items you don't need and get extra gold from selling the mats. Easy to Pickup and drop since you dont level it. 
---
It's a bit late to the game but Alchimist is the I don't want to worry about it choise. You wont make that much money on it but it compliment well herbing. 
---
So go herb 100% and add mining for maximum profit and headache, enchanting for easy extra gold from dungeons or alch for the convinience.
---
Literally never seen it and have got Exalted. I've even tried myself but alas.
---
Ok this video marks about the 100th time I've seen this, can someone please explain why the fuck people keep playing with unit frame text turned off, but then constantly mouse over the frames to see the percentage? Just turn the god damn numbers on.
---
We've disenchanted like 4 Bloodfang Pants so far. At least 1 drops every week. 
---
And we've NEVER seen Netherwind Pants ;_;
---
yeah and he has the actual record for fasted leveling to 60 with Classic.  
---
So in a way, its abuse :) i'll like to see him try it again, without Layering :D
---
I tap after the first Shadow bolt and every third or fourth so I keep my hp at 80% whilst not wasting the demon armor regen. Maybe a healthstone if needed.
---
On hard
---
There is a way to enter from the lava using this side
---
Yeah I'd say the spirit buff is a RP buff
---
&gt;How are honest players supposed to compete against people using macros and scripts to leech honor while AFK?
---
 
---
you can't compete honestly so don't bother. These problems have always existed and you should know what this "honor" system entails before devote all your time to it.
---
Welcome to gen z, the ADHD generation. Now you understand why they call watching a movie in 1 sitting a "marathoning it"
---
I mean yeah you could but a single maul will do more threat then you get from applying a couple of hots
---
&gt;Don't worry though, it'll simply move to Emperor Thaurissan's loot table meaning you have to clear the entire of BRD to farm it.
---
but the drop % goes from 2 to 5.
---
I think you're right in that SF isn't as good yet. I personally prefer it because it's really good for pvp, while still able to keep pace in pve. As opposed to prep builds.
---
I think the most important thing for me is that if you do get healed, don't immediately start tapping again. Good healers know how much HP each of their heals restores so will deliberately downrank their spells for mana efficiency and to keep overhealing to a minimum. If you're going to tap, do it until your mana is nearly full and then let the healer cast one big heal in your direction. If they don't heal you, eat.
---
The other thing you can do is whisper the healer just after the dungeon starts and say "mind if I life tap after pulls to save time?" - the majority of healers will say it's no problem and then you can go ahead with impunity.
---
I I mean I have a lot of gear because I am also my guilds main tank. I have been playing around and have roughly 25% crit and 4000 health with my player versus player gear on, I don’t have bangs like on slot girdle or band of accuria. I get a decent amount of white hits for around 900 but when I’m watching other people play online like Bajeerah hitting for like 1700 and 1200 pretty regularly it makes me concerned my gearing probably isn’t on point.
---
I had exalted by Friday last week.  After that grind I took this entire week off.  That’s probably what happened in this case.
---
# Geared Holy Priest seeking new raid group on Westfall - Alliance (PvE)
---
Relaxed, easy-going, &amp; skilled player looking for a new home. I left a toxic guild a few weeks back and have since been having a bit of difficulty getting a consistent spot in a raid group. The guild I moved to is great but they're pretty much full on holy priests, and I haven't been able to get in the raids every week. Ideally I'd like a guild who has MC on farm and can clear it in around 3 hours or less. I'm looking for weekday-evening or weekend raid times and I'm pretty hyped for BWL.
---
I have collected 6/8 T1 (interested in collecting the last 2 pieces mainly for cosmetic purposes), Benediction, Hide of the Wild, Truefaith Vestments and otherwise have all pre-raid BiS except for the healing neck from Undead Stratholme which I've attempted to farm for close to 50 runs at this point. ECS tells me I have around 650-700 +healing depending on its mood. I'm also 300 Tailor/Enchanter with no real rare recipes except riding skill to gloves, unfortunately.
---
I'd consider transferring servers but ideally would like to stay on Westfall. I also have a 51 hunter alt, and a few friends who aren't actively playing at this time but I'd like to be around in case they do come back in later phases.
---
Save gear all you want, none of them will DE into nexus crystals.
---
Did my first MC with two other locks, one of which was incredibly geared. The only tier piece that dropped is the shoulder and it was the one piece he didn't have. 
---
Guess who won it.
---
Haha that's awesome :D Reminded me of WotLK when the last talent of the demonology tree was Metamorphosis, which notably increased you armor by 600% for 30s on use, there were vids on WCM of Locks tanking Anub'arak on Heroic. Demonology was always a funny spec :)
---
Here?
---
Absolutely true, but... 
---
In the spirit of christmas and the grinch:  aggro is aggro no matter how small. 
---
It' s just an added benefit, and better for the aggro to go to the tank than the healer.
---
So I am rocking pretty much every piece of tank gear you could be right now except onslaught girdle and band of accuria. I’ve been playing around and I feel like the Valor shoulders, Eldridge pants, and crown of Tierreny partnered with Slash claw bracers have help we’re hitting harder but I’m still on the edge of what I should be doing
---
Try to get deathbringer from Onyxia, try.
---
Wait so just queuing hs will lower your hit requirements? So you would queue it up right after a mh swing, let your oh hit and then unqueue it?
---
I mean that sounds good an all but is that really why there is such a difference in those two parses? The guy’s dps is better all around not just from melee hits.
---
Same shit than mc
---
If youre fishing in AV you are a non participant and should be kicked
---
Have not happened to me once, I have always win after starting the summon. It is only a matter of educating the Horde to summon instead of argue. Best when timed with a wipe in north so that people are nearby in the mid graveyard.
---
This is infuriating... and accurate
---
Making me miss Shaman! D:
---
...This is why I say WF is better than Seal of Command. 70% of weapon damage is nothing compared to two extra attacks at increased AP.  :/
---
this completely changes the outcome. 200g while fucking around sounds super efficient. gratz man
---
The holy pally rotation in wrath was Holy Light, Holy Light, Holy Light, Holy Light. It was mind numbingly boring to be a pally healer back then.
---
/SUF in chat. Lot's of customization!
---
I guess there are some video guides out there, but I just played around in settings to make it look how I wanted it :)
---
Slap things in the face with chunks of metal because you are mad as hell, charge people to slap them in the face with chunks of metal strapped to your arm and if you for some reason are about to die, shout them so the run away and you can chase them to slap them with a chunk of metal strapped to your arm, play warrior
---
Really no potions? No elixirs? No food buffs?
---
No it didn't, you take small amounts of damage from being hit but there is nothing in any BG that gives the 10% death hit.
---
I’ve gotten reported so many times for “faction griefing” happy holidays horde
---
Warlock. 
---
- One of the coolest thematic classes with awesome class fantasy. 
---
- Tons of class quests. 
---
- Free mount, and by far the coolest epic mount in the game.
---
- Fantastic in PvP.
---
- Multiple viable builds for both PvE and PvP.
---
- Insane leveling efficiency, you will have close to zero down time and will never have to eat or drink.
---
- Great utility between summons, health stones, soul stones, and curses. 
---
- Despite being a dps class, you are under represented and required for raids so you will have no trouble finding a raid spot.
---
- Amazing looking tier sets. 
---
- While you might not top the dps charts now, you scale incredibly well into thr AQ / Naxx phase of the game.
---
- Absolitely eat mages in PvP. You are the anti mage.
---
So yeah, play warlock.
---
I made the post mostly because of Bob. (Outcome number 3). When Bob does his thing the madness arises within Horde and people cannot think clearly anymore.
---
wait a couple minutes until your pvp turns off automatically and make sure it stays off.
---
All systems suck, just for different reasons. 
---
Assuming your loot council isn't perfect, it sucks for cohesion of the raid and breeds resentfulness. 
---
At least dkp is fair, you get to make your own destiny.  
---
How many times has a dip system caused a guild breakup vs. loot council? I've never heard of dkp destroying a guild but LC all the time.
---
You can, if you have access to a [3D Printer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3327431/).
---
It’s great for the amateur section
---
Lmaooooo
---
I don’t like the overly optimistic replies you’ve gotten. On my server most people are just farming AV constantly and will be for weeks or longer for rep. I think people were forced into taking breaks and leveling alts during the world PvP shit show but not so much right now. LFG channel seems dead and people are struggling to fill slots in mid level dungeons. Classic is just weird but I hope it changes for you though - I’m sure more people will be returning from a few months’ hiatus after exams / holidays, and if the AV burnout doesn’t cause the others I mentioned to quit, people might play their alts briefly as well.
---
I'm definitely trying to get that, yeah! But in the meantime I'm trying to make do with what I have, which are daggers right now.
---
Lol yeah it probably was, I should have posted the back story. I was surprised at how pissed and entitled this guy was over some plague bloom. It looks like people feel hes justified. Lol oh well, there goes a few fake internet points.
---
Not really. Still has pineapples so you can pick off the pizza and get the good parts if you want.
---
That's why shamans are the best class for Hand of Rag. (And kind of the only real one, buuuuut.) Most of the time, ours does decent damage even in MC. Sometimes, he windfuries on pull and dies instantly, and everyone has a laugh.
---
Taphappy locks and hunter pets = healer parse padding when nobody is taking damage 
---
they are frens
---
It's because he is working off flawed logic and assumes everyone in game will be ass holes and need when they don't.  He is most likely one of those people and doesn't want to lose his opportunity to ninja items. Why else would he be so defensive and refuse to explain his logic? It's because if he does explain his reasoning he will look like a moron. I don't think we should hold our breath for one.
---
The only think it would really affect on end game items is when someone would have sold a BOE they could have used and instead opted to sell it to get their epic mount or something.  They would now most likely equip it unless they really wanted to roll the dice to win it to sell. Will it affect the economy?  Yes, but not in the drastic way he is describing.  I would be happy to pay more for BOEs if it meant less people can ninja them.
---
A guy I know got 300k honor and exalted AV in the first week and had literally zero HKs. He is still rank 0 but has his AV gear.
---
You still haven't answered my question tho hows fishing afk when you literally have to sit by your computer to fish this whole post of yours is a waste of time bud
---
100% droprate confirmed according to above poster's logic.
---
Gz!
---
First mate hat
---
The 1 ring
---
Royal durgal
---
Ah yes, the UnstoppaBle Force.
---
The other side of the coin is I kept hotting/healing the low mana lock and they never tapped. Just kept wanding mobs in the dungeon.
---
Anyone have a link for a google sheet of hunter bis by phase?
---
Imagine being corpse camped in a non contested zone.
---
What about all the casters who contribute? They will rarely if ever get a chance to loot.
---
&gt;~~The level 30~~ player ~~can't escape or react so he can be considered a target dummy~~
---
Ahh yes, so a PvP scenario eh? Who'd have thought...
---
I didn't mean "clearing" it either. But even then, there's only a handful of trash before the first boss, not all that much to farm. If they could get past Prophet but not clear BWL, something was very wrong.
---
You have no clue about up-to-date slam marco, right? It is mentioned in article.
---
Beyond the obvious, that its not their priority, there is another matter. BGs aren't taken that seriously. If a dedicated PvE server actively tried to pvp optimally, I'm sure they could do quite well, but if you're some raider that's just obligated to go get exalted with AV for the items, then you're probably not gonna give it your all. I'll often eat dinner and watch something on a second monitor while farming AV, and you might indeed catch me trying to aimed shot a person that is now running towards me. Because I probably clicked the button then focused on the food and entertainment again.
---
I hate this but I love it at the same time
---
Lifetap scales in classic?
---
You can go one step further and do
---
`#showtooltip Teleport: Ironforge`
---
`/cast Teleport: Darnassus`
---
This will show the tooltip for Ironforge but teleport to Darnassus
---
So... when I see Primalist Thurasomething yell, I tell everyone to kill him/her at all costs.  Because you can't summon Lok if he's dead.
---
Depending on where Alliance is turtled this can be very trivial.  In my last game we were turtled around FWGY with Horde holding the keep.  Primalist died as soon as they left the keep in a run for mid.
---
So, it depends where the Alliance is.  Ideally, you want them to be turtling, not you.
---
Maybe we've been having a different experience. Or maybe - you're just carrying the Horde to victory whenever you play. You legend.
---
Definitely don't use +8 agi on anything  but tier. I would refrain from using it on t2, since you want to rock full t1 when you get it... T2 isn't better than t1 before you get 8set which will take you a hella long time as an alt hunter.
---
As for +3% hit, don't worry about it. But 600g seems like a lot?
---
On my high pop server the cost for the mats is:
---
Lava core x2 = 8g(can get this from guild tbh)
---
Essence of earth x2= 7g
---
Dark iron bar x6 = 18g
---
And 4x delicate arcanite converter  which is basically 4 arcanite bars = 220g
---
So on my server which I don't think is particularly oddly priced it would be like 250g? or so for the mats which is a lot more reasonable. Try add up the mats prices and get a guildie or something to craft it for you, the recipes drop all the time anyway
---
If you can see what is going on, then it doesn't matter what is used. If you one of the douches why cries about screenshots, you're literally just doing it to conform with all the other people who cry about it.
---
Wipes are never the issue, its people fighting over loot they dont get -.-
---
Searing pain is Warlock's Mind Blast after all. It's said in the tooltip to "cause a high amount of threat". Seems to work alright if the DPS's aren't going crazy :)
---
My guild can relate.
---
Why should Alliance EVER turtle?
---
If the game is lost all we do is finish off every lieutenant/commander and cap all towers we can for extra honor.
---
That's fair and totally possible, but again, I wasn't trying to make that my main point. It's just a fact that I wanted to include
---
I'm imagining a 3 hour session of DND BRD, and we'd still be in the prison area. DND takes a long time. We usually play in 8 hour sessions and only get the equivelant of 1 dungeon done.
---
Right, just wait 5 minutes and they can't attack you
---
No I'm on Mograine and it's just a standard PVP server
---
Cool it Bill Cosby
---
don't jinx it !!!
---
You also have two different spreadsheets in the rogue discord to check it.
---
4 shadow bolts is 1450 mana, and its 10 seconds. how can 2 min consumables keep up?
---
So you downvote my post because I want Blizzard to stop these dishonest players?
---
It's a legitimate complaint that lots of people want.  Just because these problems "have always existed" doesn't mean it can't be changed.
---
It's pretty decent for pvp healing. High armor, and it has stam and +healing.
---
I've downed Ony around 8 times and have not seen one shaman helm, though the pants dropped off rag on our guilds first kill, so that was neat.
---
So I was in a bg yesterday where people were calling for this one guy to get flagged/reported as afk.
---
It wasn't till I got out and checked honorspy that I realized that same guy was ranked 3rd and had over 600k honor last week and this week.
---
There aren‘t any (relevant?) daggers that slow in the game.
---
This is one of the main reasons daggers are only considered viable for tanking as a warrior.
---
I heard the effect canceled on pservers too.. it's just that 75 str is really good on short fights.
---
Yeah there was def a better way to do it, good prank though
---
Because not all are after rep, some people just want to see the hours long AV and some truly are trolls. The Horde who are after rep do not want the AV to last forever.  
---
It is true that it is better for horde to play a bit longer, but the thing is that after 30min the rep gained in AV falls off (someone made a post about this, sry I don’t have the link). So the most optimal play for Horde would be to let Alliance have SHGY and hold them as hostage for rep farm and kill Vann at around 20-30min.   
---
However when Bob happens what Horde should do is summon the Icelord so that the game would still be over at around 30min. Unfortunately most people do not realise this and think it is just a meme and the game can last for 45-75min which is bad for A&amp;H both.
---
After 4 more tries from your post I finally got it. Thanks for the motivation lol and that run netted me the rod and ring from tribute so gold was the best possible run.
---
Some do but most don't. Less then a quarter do i would say. Most of my guild raid logs sadly as there isn't much else to do
---
&gt;We do not like going back to defend at all
---
At most we have someone play interference to delay Vann kill so we have time to kill Drek.
---
MANY WHELPS HANDLE IT

50 DKP MINUS

Hey, Ive beaten plenty of Red and Skull leveled Horde with nothing but my Sword, my Wit, and my pocket Warrior.
---
I'm horde so I do not know.
---
It's so disapointing, you manage to gather 9 players from your team of troglodytes to come mid and clic the damn thing and... Nothing happens.
---
I'm glad I'm done with this joke of a battleground
---
I have a warlock (25) a rogue (27) a mage (35) and a warrior (48) I do have a 60 though so my advice would be to get something to 60 then ease up and go for the alts.
---
I got mine for 350 on mograine
---
Do you play a warrior because the 305 weapon skill trope is just not correct
---
A) strat live, reserve first orbs. Even when you can't get paid for Pugs, reserving an orb as a tank is quite usual. 
---
Otherwise, farm Satyrs is Azshara - farming fel cloth, random greens and runecloth. But you want herbing to go with it. 
---
B) no. 
---
C) takes some grind to get mage up, but past level 45, the grinding itself provides money. 
---
If you can't get A to work, level the mage
---
This. We entered MC for the first time this weekend, by Sunday we were stuck on Baron. Classic content is hard as fuck right now, and this is coming from someone who’s never played before, but I can admit I’m having a blast learning and it feels so good when the boss finally does die. It’s an overwhelming communal sense of accomplishment
---
Alliance with even a small premade wipes the floor with Horde just by doing a pure Drek rush. The only problem is the Alliance's map advantage in AV is completely reliant on epic mount speed (when you lose your tail near balinda the slow tail never recovers), and non-premade alliance groups have about ten people with slow mounts if they even manage to open the gates with 40 people.  Instant queues actually hurt alliance because people don't respect the queue and you open the gates with sub 30 people and automatically lose.
---
This is a great story, until you realize hes probably a bot, and you just helped a gold farmer.
---
Rouges?
---
it's like saying "we're forced to spam MC for months"
---
who's forcing you
---
Why is band a tank prio? that's a straight up hunter &amp; rogue item
---
Didn’t even know this was a thing! So is seems like I should be switching targets and hitting with Maul instead of defaulting to Swipe?
---
I’d heard from someone (I forget where) that Swipe was an “aggro dump” - but I guess I just assumed that that was a good thing without actually knowing what it means hahaha
---
Haha I love this concept AV is so mind numbing surely we’ve been grinding it for months
---
I believe they removed that because people were abusing it to let in their premades.
---
I have summoned the tree 2 times... Both lost because Allianz was mid camping the boss while the base was under siege
---
https://www.wowclassicbis.com. Not a google sheet. But gets to the point.
---
rank 1 frost nova - i believe has the same duration and isnt a huge dmg change for a lot more mana for max rank
---
If the group is moving at a good pace and not needing to stop and drink a lot, then fuck it, tap away son.
---
If the healer sits down to drink, thats your queue to eat.  If they put a HoT on you, that's a signal to tap.
---
Personally, if I find healing a warlock to be a problem I just stop healing them out of combat. We both know you have the tools to sort your own HP out.
---
I used sword of zeal and ms until this weekend and it’s a pretty great combo. As most everyone has suggested I would use that.
---
T1 have mix of stats - int/stam/spirit/fire resistance.  
---
All of them are good, up to the point that 5 good stats may outweigh one "best stat".   
---
+healing only matter if your tank is taking more damage that you could heal. Druids are almost always appointed as raid healers, so for you utility stats matter more. Int/spirit/mp5/stam/fr/armor - all of them allow you to heal more, survive and continue to contribute.
---
Of course if you are not chasing HpS meters :)
---
If you're new where are you posting a tactics thread analysing opponents week by week performance lmao
---
Awesome! I’ll try this out later :) thanks!
---
Dont bother canceling, specially if you are horde and have stuff like Hand of Justice, just use BT and WW on CD and HS (and let it cast) when you have +50-60 rage.
---
After a enh shammy totem ninja pull on rag RL be like: "WHAT THE SHIT IS GOINZ ON GUYZ?!" haha
---
Right after that ninja pull, first time in mc feral drood ninja pull rag trying to get to melee spot RL be like: "WHAT THE SHIT IS GOINZ ON GUYZ?!" lol.
---
Most fun raid since the start of raiding :D.
---
This hurts
---
Ok man, but this brings us back to spell power vs attack power ret. Attack power ret will make more use of crusader as seal of command price scale with attack power whereas spell power ret will not get as much out of it as they will be using seal of righteousness. 
---
That being the case, from the perspective of a spell ret build, which enchant would you prefer an enchant that you do not have many ways to proc and does not synergies with your build or an enchant that procs fairly regularly with the main seal that you will be using.
---
I feel the opposite: these little moments of players creating their own stories is what keeps the game together and I take every opportunity to partake in these things. It's the other parts where I feel like I'm wasting my time, waiting for a bar to fill so I can get my dopamine fix.
---
You won't be behind, but as vagrant61 said, you'll have trouble finding other people to play with since most are doing battlegrounds now and much fewer run dungeons or level alts.
---
Ah the Henry Cavill method
---
Fantastic, all I need now is some friends!
---
&gt;The Alliance has faster way to Drek
---
https://i.redd.it/t84rqew2ad541.png
---
I don't know why people are still saying this. If all 40 horde rushed Vann, Horde would win every time, unless Alliance abuses the wolf glitch to solo pull Drek or heavily outgears Horde. But Horde didn't try this from day 1, for whatever reason
---
Raiding enhancement shaman here. Earth shock is not necessary to pull agro. Even after waiting for 5 sunders + 5 seconds, windfury procs on each of my first two swings is a death sentence. Big joke within the raid group, good times. Repairs be damned, it's worth it.
---
I saw him at Barrett - Jackson a few years ago.
---
Well yeah, the Alliance map advantage is completely reliant on using epic mounts with max move speed buffs to get ahead of the horde intercept.  That's why Alliance premades have a 100% WR and Alliance pug has a sub 40% WR.
---
Baron is tough for newer raids, it's the first fight where one person's failure to act can wipe the entire raid. We're clearing him consistently but still occasionally someone will not be paying attention and detonate inside the raid.

Keep in mind, if you bind it to a button, check your keybind menu. Go in, and on something that doesn't have a bind, hold shift and press that button. If it suddenly says &lt;some action&gt; unbound, then your macro wasn't working because technically you were pressing another keybind.
---
You'll need a different keybind OR to unbind that shift keybind in your keybind menu.
---
First of all, arcanite transmute can be 10g every 2 days which isnt bad, potentially other transmutes if you get a cheap recipe/grind rep. Ive made tons with the flasks of supreme power, i profit about 20g per flasks so i try to get the mats for as many as i can before a weekly scholo run, however its true these require some gold to invest in order to buy the mats in the first place. Also download TSM (trade skill master) look up a tutorial for this on youtube(bregvids is a good gold making youtuber and has a video) you need this addon because different days could have different alchemy crafts that are profitable. The main thing is BUY HERBS CHEAP, they always very in price, buy when low. For some items, like black lotus which i buy in bulk, buy in trafe chat. If you can save 5g per black lotus, thats adds up in buy buy several. This might not be super clear, but really look up bregvids on youtube, ive learn how to make most of mh gold from him. You will need some capital to invest though, you might have yo farm your first couple hundred gold until you can start craftimg stuff for gold.
---
Go check out skarm tank. Really informative guides for all tanking classes. Dudes been the premier classic tank for years on pservers and stuff. 
---
Also, i dont feral tank, but i think you wanna be using maul a lot as well for single target. Like, lets say youre on a 3 target situation. Assuming you dps knows what theyre doing and the group has an understood kill order, you should swipe, maul skull, maul x, maul skull, swipe, maul skull etc
---
That rotation was completely theoretical but utilize tab mauling more than just swipe spam, specifically for the targets that are peeling off. Tanking properly is really dynamic in classic, it takes a lot more than spamming one button and hopin it all works out.
---
You could try EU servers but idk
---
emphasis on clicking and keyboard turning
---
Bless you healers that heal front line warriors.
---
And to those that don't. A plague on both your houses. /shakes fist

Tell that to the poor Felheart Belt, 95 gold during peak hours, still hasnt sold.

Thanks for the informative reply.  What about a mid 20s hunter that is skining/mining?
---
What if you using staff ,(dominance/Nef staff ) :-)
---
 I mean Mageblade is best now by far but hard to get sometimes.. 
---
And whats your opinion on Chromagus claw everyone saying its a trap and waste of dkp as it has zero hit or crit
---
You are not behind.  
---
I rerolled on another server and see there's constantly parties to go into lower level dungeons.  
---
Check activity of your server. Low population one are in bad situation here, yes.  
---
But again - you could reach level 60 without single dungeon run.
---
I am so glad I don’t pvp. Too bad I still get to experience all these pvp whine posts on this sub all the time.
---
While BWL is not hard in the larger scale of raids, the logistics of doing this raid with 40 people begins to weigh in more casual atmospheres.   You will most definitely see BWL act as a barrier to many guilds, especially guilds that still have regular wipes in MC.
---
Vael for example will probably trim 30%+ of guilds and easily stop 90%+ of pugs from proceeding.   Not because she is hard, but because of preparation and a lack of player awareness.  This can be seen on Rag today, if your guild cannot kill rag in about 2:30 or less, your guild likely will not kill Vael untill people tighten up.  She has more health than him and a 3 minute timer with additional mechanics that guarantee a player death every so many seconds.  
---
Nef for example is a test of preparation, his fight is very long and designed around testing if your group took the time to prepare to fight him.  From the cloaks to consumes, he will test and see if your raid brought potions and was wasteful with Mana.
---
It's not hard, but it's the first of the 3 barriers in wow classic raiding.   My estimates from experience in Vanilla and Private servers and what I've seen put progressions like this.  MC(100%) ; BWL (60%) ; AQ40(20%) ; NAXX(10%). With each % representing population that will ACTUALLY have the chance to kill the end bosses.
---
From level 1?
---
Calm down satan
---
Still popular.
---
Is there a way to switch blacksmith specializiation?
---
As a very proud shaman main, I'd urge you to stick it out if you're at least enjoying your time now. The experience you're having leveling will largely decide if you're into the overall class design and style and if you'll enjoy it later on. I personally love feeling super useful in any situation. The amount of versatility and utility shaman has is unmatched besides maybe a druid. We adapt to fights very well and become one of the strongest pvp specs when elemental/resto while still being able to efficiently do dungeons and raid healing. 
---
I think if it's not scratching that melee itch now, you may want something else, but the fact that you like casters would suggest you would like ele shaman, which is incredibly powerful and terrifying in the right hands, all while being sort of a battle mage class, if you're into pvp.
---
If you're not into pvp or at least healing, then maybe it's not for you. You will be highly desired, if you decide to change it up (and you may enjoy the change a lot more than you thought, like myself, enhance to ele) but enhance is a meme and not super strong in any situation, except for being a leveling spec more than anything imo.
---
Go ele at 40 and see if you're feeling it. I know it was worth it for me but I'm heavily pvp focused. If you aren't, your shaman may always feel weak if you dont optimize it towards what it needs. 
---
Also, nightfall will come out soon, guaranteeing at least 1 enhance spot in every raid.
---
eh, horde still has to kill ally in wpvp to gain an edge over their competition during long queue times. they feed on people leveling now who think its safe. queue up in undercity then fly to epl/wpl when hs on cd otherwise around brd plenty of 50 allys to farm. they get free kills since most pvp orientied   alliance 60s are in bgs.
---
you prob dont notice cuz afk during queues, ded realm or just a keyboard warrior who doesnt play anymore.
---
I don't mean the timelines, multiple timelines is basic storytelling in this day and age. Potential mild spoilers ahead:
---
Its the back story and scene setting. For example, they don't flesh out the politics well AT ALL. It's very surface level, the acting and lines don't weave a Web of believability. It's a lot of telling, not showing.leaders around a table shouting out epic one liners does not make for tension. Its very flat in that regard. I'm fine with the action, but damn this is "Bran has the best story" levels of bad.
---
I don't know. Horde here, EU shards, we are basically 100% victory against alliance pugs and almost 50-50 vs alliance premades.
---
The chokepoint with the tower in hordebase is better than any amount of bridges.
---
Lol here I am raiding on my green equiped hunter without consumables
---
I love this, I've encountered a few of those people on higher levels. I was lvl 55 and some dwarf warrior was lvl 60, he kept on helping me with Shadow Hold in Felwood on Stonespine server. Lovely!

**About Us:**
---
What you'll find at FoF is a smaller, more personal group of players that truly enjoy playing the game together. We are looking to facilitate that culture with new members that want to come in, shoot the shit with us, down some bosses, and make sure everyone still has plenty of time for their real life responsibilities.
---
We began hosting MC Pugs 2 weeks ago and have progressed to 9/10 with Rag down to 10%. Each raid we have filled with more guildies and had to pug less. We are looking to take that next step into full guild runs and need a few more members to round out our team.
---
We are happy to take members who have never experienced raiding in vanilla, or on private servers, or even in WoW at all. Our officers have done the content, they know the game. We'll be here to help guide you through the content.
---
**Needs:**
---
We are currently looking for 2-3 Hunters, a few Melee DPS, and 1 more healer of any class.
---
Any class/spec that feels like they would fit our culture/team is encouraged to reach out even if not specifically called out by our needs above.
---
**Contact:**
---
For more info feel free to stop by our discord or DM me (pwlocke#7260). You can also look in-game for Bahnzo, Gallar, Freshprintz, ArtGarfunkel, or Daeranor.
---
Baron Geddon... I was the bomb... I moved too slowly and blew the whole raid to bits... I got HATE whispers... It was hard to show my face afterwards.  Glad that I am a better player with better add-ons in a fun chill guild all these years later :D
---
This right here is the problem, we are a support class, last pick for everything
---
Feels bad man, my alt mage has Netherwind Pants.
---
People are holding onto them *for* nexus crystals, assuming that when they’re added the epic items can turn into nexus crystals
---
Staff is better than shitty blue with off hand, but mage blade or any other raid 1 hand with the AV offhand is going to better probably.
---
I completely disagree, I've cleared MC every week since release except week 1 with either pugs or in one of my 3 guilds.  I only have 3-4 parses uploaded with my name on them on my highest count char.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yea, I may be fortunate in the sense that my loot council recognizes my lack of gear so I’m priority on band of accuria at the moment, unfortunately though I haven’t seen it drop in the past 9 MCs...
---
Why do people feel like they MUST play the current "meta" ? You don't HAVE TO farm AV mindlessly for hours. I haven't set foot in AV even once myself and I'm having a blast now that wpvp has calmed down. I might farm r10/11 in a couple of months time when BWL is the new "meta" and AB is released, I don't feel like torturing myself right now.
---
Play what you enjoy, not what some basement dwellers on the internet consider "meta".
---
Because threat is king
---
I work in software.  Anything the end user can possibly do to break the system WILL be done eventually and it's always the vendor's fault.  Blizzard can't anticipate every shitty behavior but when it happens, they should fix it thoughtfully instead of slapping on a band-aid that causes even more problems.  This is BASIC DEV SHIT.
---
I just want to gloat about the 10 arcane crystals i looted last three hours. Wow I cannot believe I spent 3 hours of my life mining an imaginary crystal.
---
If you are one of the tanks you should be getting it before dps, especially since feral has a hard time getting hit while keeping high mitigation.
---
Dammit Bob.
---
Damaged at work, lmao.
---
You know the trash you pick up from enemy players when you loot their insignia?
---
5 blood is 50 rep. 20 scraps (you loot 30-40 from players) is 10 rep. Each meat is 10 rep and you can loot a dozen from a single player.
---
You can easily get 3k rep per match if you focus on it.
---
&gt; So the other 30-40 minutes you need to be doing WPvP 
---
My server is a "Medium/High" population server and the zones are dead as f*** now that BGs have been released. It's pretty rare to find an Alliance. I'm always checking Alliance AV cave, Arathi elementals, Wetlands boat, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, and EPL.
---
I am a gnome mage. If i knew how classic would play out id play undead warlock. Why? simply because i had to flip a coin between alliance and horde, and also between mage and warlock. this would be the other side of the coin.
---
But if i only knew how it would play out, without going back in time so it would be 100% fresh and i just somehow knew how it would go. Id go gnome mage all over again.
---
But this time after i drop skinning and tailoring after creating my robe, id get herb and mining and then herb and engineering. Ive spent too much money on alchemy recipes and im the only one in the guild with some of them, so cant remove it. But thats a minor complaint i dont really care about
---
They really do not.
---
Source: horde EU here. Average winrate is probably 80%+
---
Why are they running two groups if they can't down Rag?
---
Maybe he wants to PvP or enjoy ranking
---
Loooool
---
Depends on your free time and lifestyle. Not everyone is a pro gamer. For me it wouldn't make sense to spend (my very limited) time in the gym. I'd rather practice a sport or do something I love in my free time
---
For clarification. Is he queuing HS in between the CD of BT and WW? I thought HS/Cleave was normally a rage dump and should be only used in excess of 50+ rage?
---
Except that backdoor isn’t completely reliable, sometimes I do that on the first jump sometimes  takes almost a minute. Plus it only takes two frost mages to freeze nova the horde right after they come past the southern bunker and the archers from both towers are able to shoot them down.
---
Haha and did you see the post title? Very cool. This is why we love memes
---
I've been grinding the harpy cave in AV for XP (Currently 55), since on Alliance side it seems like no matter what I do we still lose.
---
I've made an effort to talk to every other player that joins me in the cave for purging the world of harpies and it's great to talk to someone that you might not see again but you have common interests and goals with. Talking about gear upgrades, the rep grind, plans once getting to a certain level, etc. To be honest, it's the only think making AV bearable on Ally side.
---
&gt; We don't have AB or BG weekends, *so we're pretty much forced to spam this every single day for months.*
---
Ok, say it with me:  ***NO WE ARE NOT, THIS IS NOT TRUE.***
---
You are not "forced" to do anything and there is nothing wrong with playing another game for a while if you aren't having fun.
---
Alliance? Ah?
---
Are you like 9 years old?
---
Did you know if you get to play as Ryu's master if you let Mbison beat you enough in SF 2?!
---
SONIA BLADE IS NAKED IF YOU DO XYZ BEFORE ABC!!!!
---
Why you would even entertain this drivel as being true is mind boggling.
---
Sounds like my guild. We get so much shaman and Druid loot. Hunters as well. We’ve been disenchanting and selling those pieces while the mages, warriors, and rogues waste away with few if any drops.
---
Pretty sure Question 25 is wrong. 
---
&gt; Which NPC does not need to be escorted? The homing robots all need to be escorted.
---
I would hardly consider current AV to be PvP and if you enjoy ranking as it is right now, you need to seek help.
---
Holy shit that's even better than the usual method, great watch
---
We also rarely take rogues. Sometimes we do, but very rarely
---
Anyone who knows what they're talking about puts Krol behind Zeal. The procs uptime is so substantial, that it more than weighs out for Krols stats.
---
Not a fan of non melee target callers. A hunter can swap to someone easily, a warrior might not be able to.
---
Fight club discord has many useful macros and links. Also https://bookdown.org/marrowwar/marrow_compendium/intro.html
---
While warriors are more gear dependent, it’s easier to get Pre raid BIS with a warrior since you can hand pick your groups and instant tank any dungeon. It helps, just gotta wait until your item drops.
---
&gt; People will still Queue AV all the time because there is always People that Need to farm the Reputation for the rewards.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also we have crossrealm BG's there will never be a Point where there isn't enough People for AV....
---
18 minute queue for the horde already with it as the best honor and it is on only end of week 2. That number is going to get higher and higher as more people get done with reputation. You will also get to the point of higher that time gets the less people will even bother to queue causing it to rise even more.
---
Thank you!! For some reason I cannot see these on his profile on my phone
---
I rock 305 and 9%. When I did Onyxia with 8% hit I had 49 glancing blows. When I did it with 9% I had 4. So “soft” cap really doesn’t mean anything. It’s not a cap at all.
---
Fuck you, and everyone who gives advice like this.
---
"Don't bother doing well and helping the raid, just be a burden and steal loot from players who deserve it more than you."
---
Our guild DE has three full Cenarion sets sitting in his bank and two T2 helms LOL
---
305 for hit, the last 3 reduce glancing damage some more
---
We like having 1 mid kind tries to cut off efc and gets a cc off so we can catch up or just pick off stragglers hes Also my irl friend lol
---
&gt; Disengage
---
Disengage is just a melee-range threat-reduction in classic, not a backwards leap across half the planet like it is in retail.
---
That’s evil lmao
---
Thanks for posting this OP. Formerly, you were able to call your pet physically BACK to you by using the "Call Pet" option. It seems a recent update prevents this. Downside is that if I accidentally send my pet out, there is no way to recall it in a jam.
---
It also removes the hidden 1% chance to miss you cannot overcome otherwise. Casters always have a 1% miss due to this, which is why 16 is the same at 17% spell hit.
---
Apparently in vanilla they were not suppose to but they did. Maybe the same thing will happens who knows
---
Could be wrong, but to my knowledge you can’t without completely unlearning blacksmithing
---
So you don’t play a warrior then. Maybe you should try it so you know that you’re wrong
---
You never know! Must be my amazing healing.
---
having to explain what vuhdo / raidframe with mouseover macros are to healers in a MCpug.
---
I just didn't expect to spend 30 minute explaining basic raiding 101 stuff to healers =/
---
Gotta go with the default "?" for it to change to the proper one though, otherwise it just shows the tooltip on whatever icon you selected.
---
I have only played a few matches but it is so funny how the game doesn't tell you anything how this even works and you have to read up on it outside of the game. or am I missing something ?
---
Fuck Bob
---
Yes, I plan to tank through high level dungeons to secure my pre raid BIS. I think it’s mainly running UBRS, Scholo and Strat I think?
---
Healers mana pool. It's free real-estate!
---
Rift came out after WotLK and I think during Cata or right before in which case none of the PvE encounters were a joke on hard mode or heroic. You telling me Ulduar hard modes were boring? Did you ever kill Heroic LK without the buff? Probably not.
---
Completely agree with your post. I did skinning and leatherworking until 60. I ended up dropping both and went mining/eng. wish I did skin/mining from the start. Leatherworking is useless especially if you want to solo things like DMN and pvp you are 100% going to want to do eng.
---
When I heal at 51 and locks lifetap I'll heal them what I can while keeping my mana at an acceptable level. If they continue to life tap passed my limit I just don't heal them anymore until I drink again.
---
Alliance doesn’t care as much about having proper tactics that force 45-60 minute games since we don’t have queue times. We’d rather get in and out quick with a loss or win since it’s more efficient for rep and honor and then queue for a new match
---
I see. should be writte  into the secion about miss tho?
---
You are essentially the equivalent of an afk player and should be removed from the battleground and I'm not getting into a semantics game

First guild raid we spent 2 hours on Magmadar. Our shaman accidentally looted Tranq shot. Our second guild raid we spent 2 hours on Garr. Everyone sucked.
---
/gquit has an "are you sure" prompt, doesn't it? How would you bypass that?
---
I know that WF cant proc itself because of the ICD, but can WF proc off another +1swing proc that proced off a WF proc? Wasn't sure if the swing animation was long enough to clear the ICD or not.
---
Basically could you have WF proc -&gt; HoJ proc -&gt; WF proc again?
---
The majority of players probably have no clue what’s happening with Onyxia and don’t even read the quest text. Gameplay is the reason the game dominated.
---
Can confirm, things sometimes happen IRL
---
Have to unlearn the profession and re-level it from scratch
---
Like I said, i didn't read the guild part very well.
---
Aaand like I said, if the guild provides you with an item you damn well use it and dont sell it.
---
P.S. fuck you 2 random internet scrub.
---
The brackets are screwed right now.  Every week there will be a new wave of people grinding exalted.   This will die down though, I'm just picking enough to hold on to rank 5/6 while waiting for the shiney to wear off.   If you try to rank up hardcore right now, YOU WILL BURN OUT, don't do that to yourself.
---
Yeah - I play shaman so don’t have to worry about HoTs currently, but when I played priest it was pretty frustrating to cast a renew on a lock at half mana expecting them to tap and have them not do it!
---
Flamed by people who want to efficiently farm honor and rep and not be stuck in a 45 minute turtle fest*
---
That's way better; that's an actual prank. With the other ones, all you really do is waste a few silver and 10 seconds of the mage's time.
---
No pallies dispel magic disease and poison, priest is magic, druid is poison/curse and mage has remove curse.
---
test it :)
---
Also fly his char to somewhere random and remove all but one teleport reagent
---
Shouldn't matter since they can just trade back, right?
---
Depends. If you don't have ACG, ggr+distracting dagger would be better as you off-hand dmg really doesn't make a big difference. You're better off using nightslayer belt and distracting dagger than lobotomizer and muggers belt. For PvP I'd rather use mirah's song for your off-hand as it's a far superior stat-stick. If you have the spare gold, I'd recommend buying a scarlet kris. All you want from your off-hand in PvP is a decent speed and stats.
---
And 20s elemental fires
---
Yeah it really does not tell you anything for how the mode works, there are surely good info videos on YouTube
---
What’s the lowest level I can actually enter Deadmines so I can be power leveled?
---
Yeah and that's cool locks that like to help contribute to my mana efficiency get to live a lot more cause you got on my good side. By you showing a little compassion, I show more care in making sure you stay alive. Besides locks that stay alive after other dps have died usually are able to control freak situations better cause of their abundance of CC's. I can't Express how many times keeping a lock alive in a shitty pull or wipe scenario has lead to everyone dying except me and a warlock because we were able to control the situation.
---
I love you
---
Yeah, AND they release everything on a slow trickle. I honestly cant tell if they are sabotaging classic or they are just dumb.
---
They didn't try to replicate it, that's the problem.
---
Its called warcraft not hugcraft. Rogues are literally designed around not fighting fair. Our opener is called Cheap Shot and you want us to come up and announce ourselves like a valiant knight or some shit?
---
For sure
---
Dealt with WoW mods since about 2005 my dude, I have yet to see a UI package that uses different random textures and fonts, if they did that it would not be a package yanno?
---
I know what textures i like = flat and transparent, no patterned look, I know what fonts I like in game "Myriad Condensed Web" and I know how things should be laid out to my taste.  This is a flat texture, no pattern.  The font is bold and easy to read but not too big, all loot fits on one window, the rest of the UI package will follow suit but I know how to keep parts of a package I want and what I dont, I can simply drop this loot texture and layout into my current setup was all.
---
I'm running Fury with daggers and I'm getting orange parses all over the place purely using HS as a rage dump when my rage goes over 85. I'm using a 1.80 and 1.40 dagger and cancelling it become a a bit of a crapshoot when you have such fast weapons with flurry mixed in. Just focus on using BT and WW on cool down and preventing yourself from ever capping rage and you'll pull numbers.
---
Check out the rogue classic discord and download the spreadsheet there. It will answer all of your gear questions forever. Just make sure to keep downloading the updated version each phase
---
you'd probably have a point here if the alliance couldn't simply hop over the horde's ''walls'' and pull drek with nothing but IB warmaster (even if all 8 are up) while the archer from both tower don't even have LoS to attack...
---
It is still not worth for horde to stall the game 15+ minutes to get the extra honor for the win
---
I have a level 35 alch. I use gold making profs on my main because they’re easier to farm with. It’s actually more profitable for me to sell my herbs I get from jump runs than sending them to my alt to make pots. I just don’t think it makes sense to use a character like rogue that’s so good at mining hives as an alchemist when you can just do it on an alt.
---
&gt; you didn't have 12 mages and 15 warriors making up your raid 
---
Oh good, so it's not just us.
---
Lmao I like this one
---
Ok lemme break it down for you:
---
1. Thrash blade is a very good weapon.
---
2. Not every player is hardcore af.
---
3. I dont have to explain shit coz i never said that anyone is owed a carry.
---
Like me it seems, you need to read posts a bit more carefully.
---
Nothing in the early game was touched with respect to damage and gear.  Troll attempt is bad.
---
We are having fun, so fuck off with this purist crap.  Why the fuck do you care if people are enjoying the game?
---
The game is a challenge when not approached correctly.  If you do everything correctly, it's very easy.  The difficulty is not in the execution but planning and preparation. 
---
You are rusty but you know more of how to play, gear, and spec than you did 15 years ago.
---
Finally, very few people are fully geared in bis items.  The drop of purples is very low compared to the volume of people who want gear.
---
So I swap lots of slots around based on the fights but here’s a list of all the items in using. I have a separate FR set for rag and Baron:
---
Helm:
---
Mask of the unforgiven: threat
---
Tattered leather good: mitigation/hp
---
Neck:
---
Ony tooth
---
Shoulders:
---
Fireguard shoulders: mitigation
---
Wyrmtongue shoulders: threat
---
Cape:
---
Dragons blood cape 
---
Chest:
---
Breastplate of bloodthirst
---
Bracer:
---
Blackmist armguards
---
Gloves:
---
Devilsaur:threat
---
Slaghide gauntlets of the wolf:(best I’ve seen drop so far)mitigation. Note I nearly never need mitigation so I wear devilsaur nearly 100% of the time.
---
Belt:
---
Cloud runner belt: threat/mitigation
---
Frostbite girdle: HP 
---
Pants:
---
Devilsaur: threat
---
Warstrife leggings: mitigation 
---
Boots:
---
Ash covered boots
---
Rings:
---
Thralls resolve
---
Heavy dark iron ring
---
Myrmidons signet:threat/hp
---
Trinkets:
---
Mark of tyranny:always
---
Smoking heart of the mountain: mitigation 
---
Mark of the chosen: threat(nearly always using this)
---
Weps:
---
Wardens staff
---
He was just fishing, and since he didn’t earn 15 HKs he didn’t get included in the ranking and hurt anyone else so meh.
---
Dead or Alive: Warcraft
---
Not really, you won't get pass Patchwerk with that dps
---
Yeah that's why it's called a soft cap, and not a hard cap.
---
His wife left him for an enhancement shaman with hand of rag
---
Both are more mana efficient than shadowbolt though eh?  Generally in standard dungeon 3-pack I cycle through all the targets loading them up with all the DoTs, and by the time I do that the first 1 is dead.  Then I can either life tap and drain life, or wand, or shadowbolt.  Generally I'll life tap and drain, unless my resources or low, in which case I wand.
---
My mate does a lot of pvp, so naturally we replaced his Recklessness with a /afk macro
---
That’s not as efficient as actually actively farming in the open world, while scanning / advertising for such services. Now that people don’t need the key for Dm and locks/mages just solo, it’s silly to wait for a grp. Not to mention the only people that do group for it want the thorium so you end up sharing everything.
---
10
---
Forced, sure pal
---
Lol
---
Your example of stockades is stupid (sorry don't take it the wrong way) just because nothing was changed on stockades OR the items in that range.
---
Everything is like it used to be for that example except maybe some class balancing but IDK for priests... I guess you just got better OR have better gear than you had back then.
---
Yes everything is easier so far. MC was never very hard to be honest. People were just super bad.
---
You have to consider that the game has been out for 15years on private Servers and everything that can be theorycrafted has been. And People also use this Info to the fullest. 
---
Nobody is running around in T0 anymore. Everyone is completely pre-raid Best in Slot. That makes a huge difference to back then. Especially with the better itemization we have due to post nerf.
---
That being said the game is still not as easy as you make it out to be... Priests were always quite strong even when leveling. Only issue they had was mana and as you said you had mana potions...
---
Other classes like Warriors and Rogues still die a lot from even 1 mob that is non elite but 3 Levels above them. 
---
At 60 it won't get much harder until AQ40/Naxxramas. Like OK Nefarian will be a bit more difficult but besides that it should be quite easy in BWL.
---
Naxxramas was super hard pre nerf and is still very difficult post nerf. As Long as you are not completely stacked with all the world buffs which People didn't really do a lot back then either.
---
You can't Change the game to be like back then because it isn't a new game anymore. If you gave the old itemization there would probably be much more People complaining than just you right now.
---
You can never butter everyone toast. Some People always gotta eat their toast without butter... That is just how life works :/
---
Still enjoy your time m8. Don't Play priest because they are overpowered AF in my opinion. If you want the game to be more difficult then just don't Play priest
---
There is a new ring you get from being honored in WSG that is only slightly worse than underworld band. at the time WSG comes out underworld won’t sell for over 150g anymore and probably less. That said underworld band has 10 stam, 6 sprit and like 14 shadows damage while to the one form WSG is 6 stam and 12 shadow damage. I think unicorn is 13 damage but no stats. So the only ring better for locks is ring of spell power in MC, which is a 3% drop chance off several bosses. Only two or three have dropped from our entire guild and about 12 people roll on it each time, so it makes sense to pick up an underworld band if you  an spare 100-150g for it. I paid 135g for mine, after taking down someone who had it listed in the AH. Use iron forge ring for your other ring. If you don’t have the gold just play WSG and go from friendly to honored and get the forlorn ring from there.
---
Ctrl+Shift+Alt F12 obviously!
---
You asked a question and I answered. It's not the best PvE raid spec, but 2-41-18 is very decent.
---
You can get +2 hit from Voone's (quest gloves) and if you still want ur question answered without +3 from talents, then u can get:
---
2 on head strat ud
---
2 on shoulder quest
---
1 on bracer lbrs
---
2 on gloves quest
---
1 on boots scholo
---
2 on rings mara/DM:N
---
There's probably more, but I am on my phone
---
the Patrick "I love you" when the succ did her succ had me lol'ing
---
great vid
---
&gt;the hardest raid
---
Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah.
---
The Horde defends (or turtles) because of two reasons:
---
1.  We will lose the rush to the end boss everytime.
---
2. We have 15-18 minute que times so people farming rep or honor don't want just a 7 minute loss where we get little honor and almost no rep.
---
You care enough to comment on it. They care enough to comment on it.
---
I fully support this
---
This is the way.
---
Sometimes, most people let you be
---
Sorc Dagger is pretty much same quality as blade of new moon
---
honestly, in the last few days the horde has been committing way too many people to defense. i get it that you want to slow us down enough so that both faction can farm the bonushonor, but you are literally forcing the turtle by making too many respawn(or even wipe us at galv) at stoneheart while having 0-400 bonus honor
---
its like you guys are bluffing us "we dare you to turtle now".
---
consider this, non-premade ally isnt competing for ranks since premades easily makes 2-3x the honor per hour on average. so they dont really lose as much by turtle as horde. since horde non-premades are on average mixed with more rankers than ally non-premade.
---
there has already been a trend on ally to say fuck it and try to wipe you which gets shut down by people afking most of the time. people will only get more vocal about ruining your offense and defending due to being sick of getting farmed in mid/while pushing.
---
once non-premade ally start calling you on your bluff and force turtles after respawning at stoneheart, the horde part which is trying to rank will suffer a lot. honestly, everytime you wipe ally at galv, they should force the turtle.
---
You don’t get anything on your head or neck til your 30s anyway. You’re not lagging behind on gear at all
---
I like these kind of posts. Its somewhat nice to see peoples wow gaming setups.
---
It's only been four months though!
---
That is not how it works.
---
Why should only alliance stop queueing?
---
When 20% less Horde and 20% less Alliance Queue the Queue time will be = Exactly the same
---
Less People will bother to Queue when Queues get longer therefore is irrelevant.
---
Also it doesn't Change the fact that the Queue time for WSG is the exact same.
---
The whole Argument is just false sorry.
---
Can't be pranked if you just cast every spell using your spellbook ;)
---
Locks should life tap immediately after getting healed. They're buff (Demon Skin? I forget) gives them hp/5, as well as just regular passive hp/5 from spirit when out of combat. If they're full health, they're wasting mana by not allowing the hp/5 to do what it's supposed to. As the healer you just need to fight the urge that you have to keep everyone at full hp.
---
Vs an average random MC geared warrior, as a Sm ruin lock with succubus out. They charge? Instant seduce. Walk max range (31+y), Curse of shadow, double shadow. War is now angry. Seduce the second charge, walk away again, shadow bolt and shadow burn. Dead warrior. You still got coil if there's an emergency. 
---
Don't DoT them and don't try to draintank.
---
Pride in winning*
---
Here is a clip of my fail last week - it’s been playing over and over in my head since it happened
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/523412005
---
Big servers are actually not locked for transfers, they were only locked for free transfers. I just moved a character to Herod on Saturday.
---
Eh its easier to use sucu in duel then in bgs but even there they will shadow reflector her and you are in trouble . 
---
Walking max range is tough before seduce breaks as you will have hamstring/improved hamstring on you thus getting 2x shadowbolt seems hard
---
In bgs you won't be able to keep her always at distance they might kill her interupt ,fear her she is very vulnerable .Best choice is always felhunter for bgs more balanced vs everything
---
Ok virgin
---
Seymour, why is there smoke coming out of your oven?
---
I honestly feel like it should count as a DK if you kill someone that sees you as ??. Was in desolace last night and a 60 rogue that was carrying a hunter through quests made a point to sprint over and kill me any time he saw me and camped my corpse if I didn't leave the area. I'm aware both factions do this, and it's bullshit either way. Make this a DK and it stops. World pvp is perfectly fine, but being in a zone 10+ levels lower than you are killing defenseless people that are just trying to level is griefing and shouldn't be ignored.
---
Check wago.io for WeakAura import strings. WeakAuras will handle anything like that in one add on using pre-made import codes.
---
It’s not whether they’d behave differently, because they wouldn’t. It’s the fact that if pre-patch boes are bought on the auction house post-patch to disenchant, the buyer will never be able to know what mats they will get if the pre-patch items do still disenchant to pre-patch mats.
---
As a mage, is there anything worthwhile from the Darkmoon fair? I see there's a caster neck, but already have better than that right now. Should I even worry about getting fair tickets, or just try to capitalize when phase 3 hits?
---
First things first, I am an Orc Protection Warrior with [Quel'Serrar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18348/quelserrar), I have not problem tanking [MC](https://classic.wowhead.com/molten-core) or [Ony](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=10184/onyxia) and the proc of QS is so good to ignore here. I will mostly say things about the Orc with Sword perspective because I think its a bit misunderstood that Orcs can't use Swords, or should not.
---
Before breaking down everything, you need to know that hit is your friend here and from wowhead we can learn that:  
---
*Enemies have a Defense that corresponds to 5 time their level (63=315, 62=310, 61=305, etc.) This is then checked against your Weapon Skill to determine your chance to miss and glancing blow damage reduction. Enemy mobs that have more than 10 defense skill more than your weapon skill also apply an additional 1% chance to miss.* [Link here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow)  
---
So as an Orc Tank you can chose an Axe and have +6% hit or any other weapon but you need +9% hit to be capped (capped = not miss at lvl 63 mobs aka "boss").
---
The are two possible routes here, choosing [Quel'Serrar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18348/quelserrar) (or [Thunderfury](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) later on) or try out on of the many mostly blue 1H axes that other suggested.
---
**Sword:**  
---
Your goal is +9% hit, and you can get that with many items I link below. For example my character has the below:  
---
[Quel'Serrar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18348/quelserrar) and +7% Hit with:  
---
[Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant), [Battleborn Armbraces](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12936/battleborn-armbraces), [Satyr's Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18323/satyrs-bow), [Onslaught Girdle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19137/onslaught-girdle), [Gauntlets of Might](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16863/gauntlets-of-might), [Don Julio's Band](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19325/don-julios-band), and [Band of Accuria](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17063/band-of-accuria).
---
I am Tanking [MC](https://classic.wowhead.com/molten-core) and [Ony](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=10184/onyxia) without any problem since I had +5% hit! My threat and mitigation (even with +5% was) and is good, and I KNOW I'm not hit capped but I don't see any problem for this phase (MC + ONY). You can Tank MC and Only with even +5% hit if the rest of the Raid is kinda good.  
---
I won't spend my money on [Lionheart Helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12640/lionheart-helm), because first I will lose 40 stamina losing [Helm of Wrath](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16963/helm-of-wrath) and from [BWL](https://classic.wowhead.com/blackwing-lair) I can get the [Drake Fang Talisman](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman) and be 9% hit. 
---
**Axe:**
---
Using axe has an advantage of needing only +6% hit, but you most likely end up using a **blue** item for a very very very long time until you get your hands on: [Crul'shorukh, Edge of Chaos](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19363/crulshorukh-edge-of-chaos) and I am not even considering/linking the Rank 14 axe because only God can get his hands on this one!
---
I believe [Deathbringer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17068/deathbringer) is not an option here because its so slow but If you have tried it please reply and tell me your thoughts and also how was your rage generation.    
---
**Conclusion:** 
---
Its all about preference, you can use both weapons and be the best tank ever, its up to you to **adjust** your gear depending on your **weapon**.   
---
**Tip:** If you have low +hit consider the following items which are easy to get:
---
[Tarnished Elven Ring](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18500/tarnished-elven-ring) (take 2 of those)  
---
[Battleborn Armbraces](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12936/battleborn-armbraces)  
---
[Satyr's Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18323/satyrs-bow)  
---
Happy Tanking mates and remember your rotation :)
---
Very much so
---
You do realise that you compete for ranks only with your own faction on your own server? That being said I do not understand what you are talking about ‘horde part which is trying to rank will suffer a lot’. If all the games people play are approximately similar in the long run then only thing that matters is how much you play compared to others of your own faction on your server.
---
I have and the ones I’ve tried do not work. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
To my knowledge, spell pen reduces the chances of partial resist? Like if a spell lands it can still do 25%,50%,75% damage. Different from hit resists. Someone correct me if that is wrong please.
---
I've had at least three 1hr+ games in the past week.
---
One was over 2 hours. We killed the Ice Lord though, so that was cool.
---
Lmao this happened to me too. 0 buffs tho xd
---
Do you have an example of this frost built without ice block or ice barrier?
---
Yup. I have a stack of em in the bank waiting.
---
Light bless u friend!
---
I'm playing shaman with my warrior buddy.
---
Feels so good when the stars align.
---
[Alterac Manna Biscuits](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19301/alterac-manna-biscuit#comments). You only need Honored in AV for access to them. They are perfect for Locks who can lifetap to 50/50 out of combat and then use one of these. They have no excuse anymore.
---
Good ol port pranks never get old lol
---
Years ago, after raids were finished, I used to say "Opening port to Stormwind", but I'd open it to Theramore instead. They always fell for it
---
sounds like a bot dude lmao
---
If you do the against the wall into the lava jump, you technically die when you land and rezz alive inside Mc. Or at least I take durability every time I do it.
---
My druid is almost completely decked out for the available content, and yet I would trade it in a heartbeat for a fresh 60 warrior or mage in greens lol.
---
I mean my setup is different back home than the laptop I bring with me to see my family for the holidays:)
---
Cast sequence macro
---
What friends?
---
I think was he was getting at was that you should switch your OH to a very fast weapon (he labels this as "dagger" but it could be any fast OH) during execute phase in order to generate small rage amounts for faster executes more often. So in your case you should just leave perds in your OH since it is faster that brutality blade. Or you could equip an even faster OH during execute phase if you have one available
---
I think I'd notice quite easily if my blink would start having a casting time
---
I keep a metric fuckton of heavy rune cloth bandages on me and it never fails that as soon as I start using one I'll get a big heal dump from the healer.
---
What threat addon is that?
---
I think so, I'm not sure though. Chances are extremely low anyway.
---
i loved this video hahaha
---
How do you flask, use GFPP, have everyone in decent gear, and can't kill Rag before submerge?
---
Are you guys just not spreading out or something? Do you lack ranged dps? Do people not know how to get out of fire? Do your melee dps know when to get out of Rag's melee range? Do ranged dps not bandage themselves when they get knocked up? 
---
It's a pretty easy fight, flasks should make it VERY trivial. Only speedrunning guilds "need" flasks at this point in the game. Cheap elixirs do the trick just fine.
---
this will be a reddit meme soon, complaining about something exactly in the video
---
Savage
---
No it wouldn't, people do five man content harder than Naxx now. BWL will be facerolled.
---
Anyone know how to make a macro to target hostile grounding totems? I'm horde so I only want it to happen during duels.
---
Np and thank you for the work. I am still going through different parts and may have edited the above post with new points since you initially looked.
---
Pservers price history show 7-15g about double the value from vendoring those items
---
I dont find this one funny at all to be honest, more like an asshole move
---
Anyone who expected vanilla wow without any changes is a moron.  Period.  We knew there were changes and we accepted that as the price of admission.
---
I don't give a bucket of murloc spit for whether this guy likes the game or not.  It's not my job to white knight for Blizzard.  If he is going to lie and be an asshole, I'm going to call him out on it.
---
No not yet, I think it’s a spring anime
---
Transfer recommendations?
---
Hi! I recently switched to Deviate Delight and it's so slow and low-population. The Auction House doesn't have materials half of the time, and I can never find a group.
---
I'm looking for recommendations for either a pve or pvp server to switch to with a higher population, and was wondering if I should take advantage of the low pop in any way before I leave?
---
Thank you in advance!
---
I'm all no changes for some things and all in for all changes to others. Does that make me the bad guy?
---
Example.
---
No changes: I definitely don't want dungeon finder.
---
All changes: A client that runs smoothly on new hardware.
---
Maybe changes: dual specs, please
---
"FORCED" - When you are doing this completely voluntarily.
---
It's literally one aspect of the game.. Go do something else.
---
I kinda hope you do quit
---
You dont know how ranking works obviously
---
Yeah, such a tryhard not wanting to be a complete burden getting his welfare epics from the players forced to work twice as hard because you're doing fuck all. 
---
&lt;--- Retail and LFR is that way, mate.
---
They literally did the same/similar mistake in bfa so all evidence point towards Blizzard ducking up and make old epics de into nexus crystals
---
It is the locks that lifetap right after or at the very end of the fight and then just stand there. I may give them a renew, but if it was a tough fight I am trying to get my mana up to keep the group moving. 
---
These are the problem locks because they nothing at all to help with pacing. The tank and the healer usually work in tandem to keep a brisk but safe pace throughout the dungeon, but a selfish shitty lock fucks that up when all they have to do is either bandage or bring some Manna Biscuits. Instead they go out of their way to be a douche.
---
It's peanut butter jelly time!
---
Kind of agree with this, although its not fun not getting raid gear at 60 because you are specced a certain way. 
---
This definitely make many people quit the game.
---
Then why do we have a nerfed MC and Onyxia?
---
Flamelash Alliance wants you!
---
My friend has a shaman and I'm going to his tonight. What do?
---
There are no fair fights in open world pvp.
---
Any tank should be 31/20 fury anyway, there is very little benefit to deep prot past 20 points. Might as well get flurry and enrage and bloodthirst for threat, even if you still usually wear a shield.
---
raid logging? in classic?
---
How surprising! 
---
/s
---
Eh, I dont use mouseovers or healing addons either. I don't think its really necessary. I got burned on patch day too many times by extra addons before raid to want to be completely dependent on them.
---
Even from a pure honor perspective, there are significant recordings showing that honor gains are at least as good in "turtle" games as in quick games, especially in quick loss games where allies rush drek and do some form of defense game.
---
Factor in rep, and there really is no comparison. Slow is Horde favored with the current queue times.
---
Lmao sounds legit
---
That's a great way to do low dps as a warlock.
---
Siphon life takes a full 30 seconds to fully tick and scales terribly with spell damage. It'll do less damage in those 30 seconds than one cast of Shadow Bolt and costs 5 less mana. So it needs to tick for those full 30 seconds to be worth it.
---
Drain Life does way less damage than a single Shadow Bolt and takes 5 seconds to channel. Meaning you could cast two Shadow Bolts in one Drain Life channel. It ticks for 114 when Shadow Bolt hits for about 820. That's 121 dps vs 328 dps for spells ignoring that Shadow Bolt can crit. That's not worth the mana efficiency. If mana efficiency was your concern you'd be better off wanding at that point.
---
You're being brought for your dps so you should be dpsing and not trying to sustain your mana so you don't need to drink/bandage after the fight. Warlocks recover much faster than Mages do because they can just tap till their health and mana are about the same and just eat and drink.
---
Check out the Shaman Discord Server. They are updating the Shaman addons regulary.
---
Not trying to troll, seriously curious though, why am I now able to take 3 lvl 25 elites in stockades, as a 31 holy priest, when I KNOW FOR A FACT I attempted that probably HUNDREDS of times during retail and never got past maybe 1 or 2 elites before dying.  I was NEVER able to just outright pull 3 and kill them, but here we are, I can now do that.  The rest yeah, you're right on and apologies.  
---
My spec currently I'm making up from memory, likely isn't even the best setup, my gear is all green level 23 items etc from darkshire, and I have 2 blue items, the staff of westfall.
---
Like my dude is basically a decently geared level 24, but I'm performing like a level 40.  why?
---
Don't tell me it's just experience and time passed, because it's not, I haven't touched this game in years, I keep tab targetting the wrong guy, etc, like I Feel more nub than I ever was before.
---
Also stop calling me a fking liar, I'm telling you what I'm experiencing.  Maybe your fkn memory just sucks
---
Don't worry, when you're leveling you won't have enough rage to "handle' anything.
---
7 weeks? Try 14. Our guild has cleared MC each week since the beginning and we only have one benediction.
---
Well after letting most of the guild nd members aware that I'm here for the pvp only...
---
I literally asked in a Blizzard AMA if it would be pre or post nerf, and was told it would be pre nerf.  WTF are you smoking cletus?
---
From what I heard, you \*can\* get it in a raid, an it's a group-drop. So you only need to farm it once for the entire raid.
---
Would make a massive difference.
---
can you do modifiers on cancel aura? like...
---
     #showtooltip Hearthstone
---
     /cancelaura [mod:combat] Divine Shield
---
     /use Heathstone
---
that way even if had divine shield up and were out of combat, it wouldn't pop your shield until you were running for your life.
---
Thanks for the list, been using ElvUI but not liking it much so planning to change it all. Have been checking different setups
---
I mean, the suppression room is pretty brutal.
---
Have you tried playing WSG with your friends?
---
Nah, replace blink with /sit  and then watch them kite ;)
---
Now replace Slow Fall with Blink
---
This is why I really hope if TBC comes around we get it how it actually was, starting from the beginning and progressing through.
---
I want TBC *so bad* but if they dump us in on some random patch that trivializes the content I'll be fucking *heated*.
---
yeah, coming from mythic raiding on retail tot his was quite the shocker.
---
suddently dispelling stuff in a timely manner become a chore, buff aren't re-applied, people overheal a ton cause they don't see eachother heals... but they don't need addon.. cause MC is trivial...
---
What's wrong with that?
---
I was just telling my tank buddy this last night...
---
Granted, we haven't had the smartest Warlocks in our groups.. Hellfiring every pull because I'm keeping them alive.. even if it's just 2 mobs.
---
That's putting it a little harshly IMO, you still depend on white MH hits to generate rage fairly often. That said, it is true that hit's usefulness drops off a cliff after 6%.
---
Isn’t there a cooldown on transfers? ...sadly
---
Either way there is going to be literally hundreds if not thousands of people in that tiny fucking hallway fighting for a tag, pvp servers is gonna be a fucking massacre. Top guilds will just zone into ubrs and that could be camped to all hell as well its gonna be amazing lol
---
Fuck MC.
---
Yeah it sorta feels like they did it this way so they can claim we were wrong and nobody actually wanted it.
---
What I'm really surprised by is how shitty everyone's memory is, like I actually remember being in Stockades solo for DAYS during retail, at around level 30-34, trying desperately to kill elites because my brain thought I'd get more loot or something...
---
Now I can cruise in there at level 31, with lvl 24 gear on, and a crappy hacked up spec, and pull 3 and win, with very little danger.
---
Something is very fked in the current build, that was NOT fkn possibly before..
---
I agree with ya
---
I'm split between seeing you as my enemy and as my brother. Bc I think what I hate more than horde are fucking mages. I feel you bro, may you have an unlimited supply of FAPs.
---
He gets close to the pillar and when I go in the water he runs around the pillar instead of going back up the ledge and around into the water. Any tips or is this just me needing to get better at it?
---
It’s not a repeatable quest. By having one staff, you have the other. Hence why you can just swap between the two.
---
Therefore doing the quest twice and having 2 versions of the staff is unnecessary.
---
Doesn't work for everything, strangely enough. Onxyia bags are the same.
---
Lmao sensitive
---
You can't repeat the quest.
---
Put all the dialogues from Onyxia "more dots" video
---
Some of us actually need Darn since we have to fly out to get more dousing water.
---
I personally enjoy mara more as I can turn on a tv show and not worry about it. It also had awesome herbs that are needed by myself and some guildies so it’s win win.
---
Or use:
---
    
---
    #showtooltip Teleport: Ironforge
---
    /castrandom Teleport: Darnassus, Teleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: IronforgeTeleport: Ironforge
---
It separates the general chat and system chats into two windows, places a background under them for readability, and changes the font.
---
Ay thanks bro
---
Cause Blizzard could not salvage the old database from before patch 1.12?
---
The issue is that a lot of guilds will be learning these fights, which includes tank deaths. Fury/prot only really shines when you are fully world buffed up with consumes. Deep prot allows you to have solid TPS without the buff stacking requirement.
---
If you are going to use a shield a majority of the time, might as well be deep prot.
---
Saddest thing is you apparently don't get it even after being told here. I hope you have a good guild because before long no one outside of it will group with you.
---
Ofc they have, this is a turntable.
---
My main: Full tryhard max consumes all enchants because we try to go for sub 50 min MCs in my guild
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
My alt: Didn't bother farming any prebis, definitely not getting enchants, will upgrade through MC pugs by just rolling on stuff. Half afk during raids spamming frostbolt while playing on my main (have 2 accounts). Already have 5 epics from just rolling in pugs.
---
This is a unique one of a kind item which requires a quest. Why would you think you can get two? it's like the questgiver asking for vancleefs head a second time...
---
Waste of gcds.
---
An observation as a healer.  Many ranged DPS end up out of healing range from being spread out and we end up loosing too many of our ranged DPS to kill him before he submerges.  This is how we wipe 9/10 times.
---
dont forget #Showtooltip Teleport Ironforge
---
I guarantee I will be there on raid night, on time, with my consumables, and I will down all the bosses.  
---
Demand how/when/what I do outside that? Nah dawg.
---
Duh? How did you not know this before the game even launched ?
---
That's because he wasn't actually on the ledge. You need to walk a bit to the right until the center of boss circle is definitely on the ledge. If you cleared the satyr pack it should be pretty safe to do, as priest it ends up pulling the pack sometimes which really sucks.
---
In my guild, there is a lot of paranoia about world buffs.  Specifically there are people who complain they always die before getting to use them and one guy who insists that they disappear on him.  If I could get ahold of his macros, I would definitely add "/cancelaura Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer" to them just to troll him.
---
As a premade we ALWAYS do galv + LTs before Drek, and most of the time end up with a 2.9k+ bonus honor win in 8 mins... rushing drek is just for rep so good luck trying to revive that meta this late into AV release.
---
Rocking that NELF Priest like a boss!
---
Totally. However demanding how/when/what to do with your time online is different than asking that you improve your character.
---
Same here my brain hurts
---
Yeah, any mythic mechanics are harder than anything in retail. You can easily tell with meters who never stepped into a Mythic raid in any capacity.
---
Stock raid frames with showing incoming heal and health deficits is more than enough for Classic. I am a druid, so my overheal doesn't really matter. It's gonna happen no matter what. That really is more for priests that should be better with their mana. Shams overheal a ton too just because of chain heal.
---
I will say that buffing is a bitch, even with the buffwatch addon. That addon is pretty much useless imo, but I tried it out. It takes me 3x full mana pools to MoTW everyone. So dumb.
---
Put a healer in every group/every other group, how many of you stack on each other? It sounds like healers just aren't in the right places.
---
First rule of enh shammy for raid: have them remove earth shock and rockbiter from their hotbar
---
Yea just do it a bit back away from the wall and worst case swim for a few seconds towards the building. Many times I spawn in before hitting the lava.
---
Decent chest from reputation, good pvp weapons and a shield that's as strong as the rare bwl one.. It's a really good catch up raid for them. Eventually the hype will die out for everyone, just like how onyxia is dieing down now
---
my girlfriends does that slow keyboard turn too. i told her thousand times to turn with the mouse, but she doesn't listen to me. so there are two possibilities: bot or girl.
---
For something with a ~35% drop chance, I'm convinced it's rarer than getting both bindings in a single MC run. This is coming from someone who ran Strat Live for over a month to get Star of Mystaria before getting the Choker of Enlightenment out of pity. It's not for a lack of runs, I'm just unlucky. :P
---
Likewise for Witchblade. It dropped for me, a lot, but I never won the rolls for it. I can't roll to save my life in 5-mans, apparently the game saves them for MC. I replaced my weapon with Rod of the Ogre Magi and only just swapped my Arbiter's Blade back on for the Tome. 
---
In all seriousness, chances are I'll get Boreal before 5-piece, but I wanted to just know the mathematical argument in case my bad luck somehow persists. That said, I seriously don't want to know how many Vault runs I've done.
---
This is why I sit in IF just boomkin dancing and innervating all the vending machines. It's nice to just take a break and talk with complete strangers
---
&gt; my question is, what is the point of playing classic if it's not even classic, like wasn't it supposed to be pre-nerf? 
---
This isn't Vanilla, this is classic.  Classic is a new thing that is a recreation of late vanilla.  Be thankful that it exists, or go play something else.
---
You need exalted, if you have an entire day to play you can knock it out in a single sitting. It dosent take long to get it.
---
Both summons can be dealt with if you pull them to your respective tunnels.  The guards there will aggro and either merk them or pull him into the very back and despawn him.
---
So have your resident feral druid tank it and you're good to go?
---
A lot of bis MC gear (onslaught girdle, band of accuria, lion heart helm etc etc) is practically on par with naxx gear. This means melee gets the majority of their power spike early on. Most caster loot is just itemized bad in MC. In the later raids as a melee you might have 2 or 3 upgrades going from BWL-&gt;AQ gear where as a caster you're upgrading every slot with a powerful item.
---
they from herbs so they all natural.
---
Well put.
---
IF they have rockbiter on their weapon...instead of windfury...I mean, just saying.
---
I am enjoying my time on pvp mograine alliance.
---
Yeah that's the big thing. Post pull when they stand around with no food or drink. I'll help out when were all working together but that expectation is nonsens.
---
From what I've heard it's the average of everyone's lvls. So you're 14, your friend is 30. The average lvl for your group is 22, so you get how much xp a lvl 22 would get. If you made a group with more lower lvls, say a lvl 12 and 2 lvl 13, your group's lvl average would be 16, so you'd get how much xp a lvl 16 would get. As you get closer to your friend's lvl, the average will be closer to both of your lvls
---
 It's also always good to log off in an inn so you get rested xp
---
Make sure doggo doesn’t clog your exhaust vents.
---
Like what?
---
You don't need to worry about tanking as prot until you're 60.  The only thing you'd be losing on is threat generation which if you're a good warrior you won't have to worry about anyway.
---
all these people forgetting to ask what server you're on
---
ally herod- I see everything except ST advertised constantly
---
There is no defensive benefit past 20 in prot. Even if you're the least threaty most Def stacking tank ever, I'd still go fury prot. Easier time solo, more threat, same Def.
---
You don't need a specific spec to tank dungeons.
---
 What you need is to understand how threat works in vanilla and learn to tab-target sunders or use sweeping strikes+whirlwind to tank.
---
Anyone who dies to Azuregos gets a 15 minute debuff that turns you and anyone near you into a block of ice. So he rezzed and promptly froze the other tank, himself, several DPS and a couple healers. Az then spun around and nuked other DPS because the tanks lost aggro and we wiped.
---
I still haven't gotten the wild growth shoulders QQ
---
But yeah - I got the 2 pieces of T2, 4 pieces of T1 and finkles in 2 runs xD
---
140 runs is nothing you can get lockout in 15 mins that's like 7 hours of farming.  Idk what your saying with school?  And even bad raids seem to be going fury prot to keep threat numbers up.
---
I...I do.
---
This is nothing, me and a guy on my realm got 11 2s in a row before i won
---
Since i have always played horde, i'd propably play alliabce this time just to see the different side of it. Night Elf hunter propably. Or maybe a
---
a class i havent played, like Paladin, Priest or Warlock(most likely Paladin)
---
I did that the first time I got asked to sell a portal. Cast 10 seconds, hit a loading screen, oh no!  Fortunately they were understanding and in Darnassus so I just quickly ported back and opened the portal correctly.
---
"bad luck with weapons" we have no viskag no deathbringer no bre no spinal reaper 1 OEB, 2 perditions and 2 CHT. we do split clears and still dont get shit.
---
Like wsg, this is just another jump spot. While its not intended for sure, blizz didnt block out this very well known spot like they did with some of the super troll spots in wsg.
---
Also the ally are so map favored that idk if anyone is going to actually complain. This is like the one advantage horde has.
---
Ty for info, i was thinking what is this mongoloid doing in SS but this is actually pretty golden
---
I can’t stand people that do this. Our biggest problem right now in my guild is there are multiple people that don’t understand what is worth talking about during the fight and when you should just shut up. We don’t care that you, a rogue, are dead you can stop announcing it like it’s the end of the world.
---
&gt;A new experience with vanillas design is what we really want.
---
spot on. if bfa wasnt a loot casino, and instead tried to be an rpg like classic is, it might have had a far better reception. not saying everything about bfa is bad, but there's a ton that is wrong with it.
---
just to name a few: endless grind artifact, endless gear progression, no feeling of a community due to sharding across the entire region, bland class design, and so on.
---
&gt;Step 1; get some friends, you can’t do anything in AV alone.
---
You can solo back cap on your own.  It's rare (lately) to see any of my horde brothers defend towers or even graveyards after they've been capped (but not burned).  During the initial push, we don't do a lot of defending your towers to burn them, and it's pretty easy for you guys to pop in there and recap it.
---
For some reason I read HS as Hearthstone. Would have been a weird macro.
---
Weapon comparisons is what I'm waiting for too(and with this, builds to.fit the weapons)
---
I'm very much on edge since my options atm are kinda all over the place. 
---
I'm an orc warrior with OEB, frostbite, flurry and deep woods available. Hamstring OEB vs slam OEB vs deep woods+frostbite vs frostbite+flurry. Kinda onnedge which wins/should win, especially since I dont like the thought of slam given the activation time but I think I have to try it.
---
With tauren's extra Herbalism skill, you are able to  loot Black Lotuses without a chance or failing.  This means that you have an advantage vs. other people that might be trying to steal your Black Lotus.
---
Its legit, just snowball them
---
This is such a stereotypically reddit post. So many people here seem incapable of having a conversation and, instead, just make demands or offer binary disagreement.
---
All the people saying its too late are dumb. Push getting to 60, you won't have a hard time getting some dungeon gear. Get attuned to MC and ony week 1, and start raiding. Likely the tanks will have their gear by this point and you can gear up quick
---
You're worried about sbolt being mana inefficient yet you're throwing up all your dots on mobs that will die before they last anywhere close to their full duration?  Dots that don't get to tick through all their damage are inefficient as well, particularly Siphon Life.  It's incredibly expensive for how much damage it does and loses most of its' efficiency if mobs die too quickly.
---
In most cases your dps will increase dramatically if you are only casting corruption on each mob (add CoA if the mobs live long enough) and then spamming sbolt.  Even with 31 points in aff and 0 in destro, sbolt does substantially more damage than life drain.
---
The additional healing the lock needs from this is offset by the fact that mobs are dying way faster so the tank takes less damage for the overall pull.  Any healer that understands how locks work will also know this.  That's the reason they heal you even though they see you life draining, because they want you to cast sbolt, they want the mobs to die faster, and they want the run to go faster.
---
How are you going to get them to stop taking their time at Balinda?  Good luck
---
Nice assumption, turkey. Won the need roll when they dropped in BRD. Also bought a pair for 20g and resold them for 200. Thanks tho
---
My brother and I are doing just that.
---
I'm the warrior.
---
I afked from revered to exalted. Sat stealth in the mine every game and would move my character every 4 mins. Only got deserter maybe twice. This was also how I would level my Alts back in wotlk on retail.
---
I farmed over 2k gold in ZF, graveyard run. As a fresh level 60, getting my Epic mount, max  lvl professions etc. There is a lot of youtube guides. But you just have to adjust a little, since in most guides they have better gear. So smaller pulls etc. When you get the hang of it, its easy 50+g pr. Hour.
---
[G] [Warrior lvl35] : I can pull 2 mobs at the same time and survive!
---
[G] [GuildMaster] : WOW! You will be our main tank. This is the plan and the schedule to boost you immediately! We are not desperate.
---
Seriously congrats! I don’t have the patience for that one.
---
Who cares how long top guilds take to clear
---
but nerfs were given collectively to all NPCs in Vanilla. Also, Classic WoW uses the modern retail game engine and AI. Not the old one.
---
Don’t get this, why’s it so bad to port to darnassus though? I get they want IF but if we just finished and instance, porting out to anywhere would be better than running out..
---
Also a decent chance if selling it's to an alt they might not be as active with in terms of raiding.
---
Just go arms for leveling. You can effectively 2H tank until about SM Arms (and much further with a good healer). Even then you can tank but should’ve acquired a sword and board
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/atiesh-server-discord/249149
---
Iceballs bro:
---
- solo cap towers (just iceball the defending elite)
---
- icebal ppl who arrive early at balinda into balinda
---
- iceball ppl into Van and his marshalls when they try to pull just one
---
Ah so i guess they evened that out over time? 
---
My main wasn't caster dps in vanilla but just looking around for pvp you don't get much more stamina you dont get more armor with tier 3s so stronger weapons absolutely cut clothies more and more .You do get lots more damage and other stats but its primary pve benefits
---
Oh hey a machiko rabbit sticker!
---
I see this all the time, even at 60 you don't need prot to tank. I am a fury warrior, leveled as Arms and reapecced when I dinged 60, and have stayed fury since. I've tanked all the dungeons, and even off tanking in Molten Core no problem. Last night we had a fury warrior as one of the tanks on onyxia for phase 1.
---
I would recommend leveling as arms and just staying arms as long as you want. If you want to go fury at any point, just go for it, but I would probably wait until you get some good 1 handers and some hit gear at 60
---
I do as well, but most people I see playing do not.
---
Literally nobody cares. Source : I'm a guild leader and we clear MC &amp; Ony in circa 2-3 hours. 3 of our 5 priests are Nelfs, 1 is shadow spec too. Warlocks love him.
---
Bought mine for 270g. Lowest I saw was 250g. Right now on ah it's hanging around 3-400g. 
---
Kurinaax
---
We killed him without submerge last night with about 28 people since people were out for holidays. vael is gonna be a breeze.
---
I agree with the dude who was at the node first clearing a mob on it. But the way he writes is uncalled for. I can fully agree with "obviously you're free to do what you did, it just shows your type" but he got a little too mad..
---
We've seen only the eyes drop (like 10 times in a row now). Our hunters are so thirsty for the leaf.
---
it's not about the racials being bad. its about you not having a very important priest skill in raids. 
---
i mean, everyone plays their own way. there's no problem having less utility in raid if you don't care about that.
---
Feel free to link it so people actually believe this.
---
Only until your server gets geared past pre-bis.  Devilsaur leather has completely bottomed out from launch prices, and you can get the set for a fraction of what it was.
---
Aside from layers, Classic is just like Vanilla.  The game was never hard to begin with and everyone has always known that Classic rewards time investment, NOT skill investment (At least not until AQ/Naxx).  
---
I played Vanilla pre 1.12 and I don't think anyone aside from a couple of classes would have been happy with any earlier patch.  
---
You also have had thousands of people that were playing on private servers for over a decade and know the game inside and out.   You also have a million guides nowadays that never existed in Vanilla.  Even without layering, people would have cleared all the content within the first week.  
---
The issue is not that Classic is not true to Vanilla, the issue is that the playerbase has changed.
---
Yea, as a druid I feel like my impact is usually overall less on some fights (comes with the class, obviously) but I'll like check the healing charts after a boss and I'll be like in 6-10 range but 4/5 of the top healers also have the most overhealing...like here I am trying to actually conserve mana and not heal people who are 100% lol.
---
I'm currently at level 59 with 99% XP. Any fun ideas to level to 60? I'm a paladin if it makes any difference. I'm thinking discovering IF or Thunderbluff would be a fun one but I'm open to ideas.
---
As a clothie vs melee your goal is to just not be hit. Your damage spikes incredibly to the point where you can even burst warriors.  If a rogue/warr gets the jump on your of course you're still gonna die in one hit but frost mage/warlock played properly should never lose to melee once geared out. The power increase melee get from later raids really isn't that incredible by comparison.
---
https://youtu.be/gKqoZkp9bMU
---
Your only option to avoiding decay is to earn enough honor to add more than 20% of your current rank points.
---
Yeah, but then Horde turtles because they can't cooperate, not because they lose rushes everytime "because alliance has a bigger advantage here". Horde are still spewing that non-sense a lot.
---
One of my fondest AV memories:
---
This happened back in Vanilla, before the AV nerf but after the release of BWL (I think? My memory is a little fuzzy. I was 14). 
---
The Horde had taken the no man's land. Us Alliance were at the top of the hill heading to Stonehearth hoping to stall the Horde advance. The standoff only lasted seconds, but it felt like hours. Tension was high as we waited for either side to make a move. Then it happened. 
---
A single orc warrior dual wielding Quel'Serrar and Thunderfury with a pocket healer charged. Clad in a mix a Might and Wrath, the warrior was unafraid.
---
And we broke. We broke *hard*.
---
Wonder why you would stop Ony to do progression?  Not like it takes a long time.. and still free gold and loot to either DE or gear up a couple folks that would still need it.
---
Forgot the #showtooltip for iron forge
---
I duel outside AV in alterac mountains nowdays, guess it will move back to org in time.
---
Yeah I have been watching videos for the last 2 hours from actual vanilla watching similar level / similarly geared priests get hit by the elites in Stockades, and they usually take 3-4 hits and die, I can take like 12 hits - same HP, same gear for the most part, literally Tit for Tat and the priest in the vanilla videos dies usually before they can get a heal off, yet I sit there and heal right through THREE Of them, only go OOM once, use a pot, heal and barely get interrupted (without talents btw) and kill all 3.  I don't care if a Dev checks a log and says I'm wrong, I'm looking at videos of it happening from the actual time when it was vanilla, before the TBC nerf.  You're just... wrong dude.
---
I even linked to a Blizz AMA where they outright admit it's post nerf, and everything is easier.  Sorry that y'all missed the thread.
---
That's entirely up to you to decide if it's a good idea or not. Depends what your goals are.
---
There are some reasons it's a bad idea though. Will you be able to resist the temptation to play rather than work?
---
you know a rogue or hunter can use all of those other options that you listed too right
---
Yeah, I usually just pop a rank down renew on em and then let em die if he can’t make that work.
---
There's a q in burning steppes. Green leather shoulders with nothing but 2 hit. Can't check right now, but you should be able to find them on the database.
---
Classicdb.ch for example
---
Someone who doesnt pvp commenting in a post about pvp. This is new.
---
People really don't understand how much 1.5s of casting affects one's dps.
---
#Moar DOTS
---
What’s mine say?
---
😂 basically he said that a totem somehow pulled Rag on accident, a feral Druid trying to get into melee range pulled Rag. Raid leader didn’t freak out more of what the eff lol
---
I mean, as a feral druid there are plenty of pieces that are sought after by multiple classes that I can bid on.  And now I've got a lot of DKP cuz I get all my tier for rock bottom prices =p
---
What am I missing as a 60 lock I very rarely have problems with warriors?
---
Maybe it's your server. I see people dueling almost every time I head to the zeplin.
---
Not possible, specifically to avoid this. Hunters and warlocks would trivialize an entire class if it were possible.
---
2 reasons:
---
A) In classic, the players most interested in PVP are doing BGs, particularly AV, so if you go to Alterac, there will usually be a decent group dueling outside the cave waiting for queue to pop.
---
B) In Vanilla, dueling outside of Org was PVP to a lot of people, but the player base as a whole is more informed and concerned about min maxing than dicking around dueling outside of org.
---
Nope, just linked to the AMA with Blizzard devs outright admitting it's post nerf, but good try!
---
Except every third debuff the MT is guaranteed to die.   Veal picks a member of the raid, "buffs" them, for a few seconds" then they get instant killed.   You will be cycling tanks on the fight.   Basically veal kills a member in the raid in this order.   Mana, Mana, Tank, Mana ,Mana, Tank.   This kill cannot be stopped, it's part of the fight.   You will at a minimum use 3-4 tanks on the fight, all of which must be higher threat than all other DPS and heals, or veal will cause catastrophic group damage uncontrolled.
---
The fight isn't particularly hard, but many of the people here thinking it's going to be a breeze are going to get their eyes opened hardcore.   I won't be surprised if 80%+ of raids fail to kill her first week.  I expect at least 30% of raids to not even be able to reliably get past her ever.
---
From my experience, in casual guilds a lot people won't make the effort to learn the fights before going into the raid. Whilst it's pretty much a requirement to know your role and what you're going to do in a fight before going into it if you're in a semi-hardcore guild. Just putting a couple of hours of effort into understanding the in-and-outs of a raid you're going to clear for months is enough to push you from the middle of the pack to a top 10-5% parser. For me it's worthwhile because it leaves me with more time to play the game and do BGs or whatever if the raid is cleared an hour faster.
---
It's a terrible idea for your employer. But screw the man. Do what you want.
---
I am grown up and my opinion that grinding AV mindlessly for 12+ hrs a day is a waste of time lines up with my grown-uppedness.
---
Your problem is your obvious crippling self-esteem issues, no one wants to be with a person who doesn't love themselves.
---
i play retail, but as someone who uses mouseovers instead of addons for healing.. i definitely need the character one.
---
also more gosh dang character macro slots!
---
* Section 4.4, bullet 1 reads, "...becomes an yellow attack...". This also occurs in bullet 2, "...is now an yellow attack...". I believe "an" should be changed to "a", but I'm not an English major and I know a vs an is sometimes strange.
---
* Can you explain what Figures 4.9 and 4.10 are showing? I don't have a clue what a violin plot is or how to interpret it in a meaningful way. Is it basically just telling me that HS/Cleave is better with slower weapons? More importantly is this ever meaningful for decision making? I see the 2H plot in the effective DPR range of 28-29 or so, but in previous sections we saw WW and BT only getting 20-40 DPR depending on AP. Does that mean there is a point where it's actually better to use HS than BT and/or WW? That seems off.
---
* Slam section 4.5 there is a typo in the 2nd sentence of the first paragraph: "... and t is important to note". Probably meant to say "it" is important to note.
---
* I believe Figure 4.11 is incorrect. This is supposed to show DPR compared to AP values between Slam and BT, but it shows their DPR gains in parallel linear growths which would suggest Slam is always a higher DPR than Bloodthirst at every AP value. Then we see in Figure 4.12 that BT has a much steeper slope for raw damage per AP value. Both Slam and BT are fixed cost abilities so these charts conflict. The point where Slam and BT deal the same damage should show Slam as 2x the DPR of BT. At lower values of AP, Slam should have more than 2x the DPR of BT and at higher values it should have less. At some value of AP, BT will hit 2x the raw damage of a Slam and they become equivalent DPR, and then at all values of AP above that BT will have a higher DPR.
---
* The paragraph after Figure 4.12 is incorrect to the chart and summary in the title of the chart. Slam's damage is still higher than BT up to 1500 AP with a tier 1 weapon, and more like 1700 AP with a tier 2 weapon. I also don't know if it's really accurate to say players should prioritize BT over Slam with excess rage. To me it sounds more like you always prioritize Slam (until you have enough AP that BT actually surpasses Slam in DPR - if that's even possible), and you dump excess rage after a Slam with BT and/or WW. Maybe I am just thinking of this one from a different mindset though.
---
The bracers aren't any good for feral tanks, they are stam/int/spi and +spell damage.  You can get green bracers with agi/stam that are better stat-wise and almost on par with armor.
---
This is so backwards lol. I’m alliance as well but to say the biggest losers are the horde because they’re *winning* AV in matches longer than 10min is silly lmao 
---
People are so quick to cry about everything lol
---
What's the etiquette here? I was forming a dungeon group, had 2 guildmates, a random, and me. Spent 10 mins looking for a tank, and eventually a guildmate tank wanted to join but also another guild dps. My guildmates said we should boot the random and invite the two guildmates. I told the random what was happening, apologized, and told him I'd pay him 5g for the inconvenience.
---
I felt bad about it since I had invited him and then booted him even though he hadn't done anything wrong. But my guildmates told me since no one had left for the dungeon yet (the random was still in the same farming zone he was in when I invited him), it was fine.
---
At the end of some dungeons back in the day if the people I grouped with were assholes id make a portal to darnassus instead of ironforge.
---
Just need to get a friend I know I’m person that plays wow
---
You can use addons for this now, worst case you have to click a button like 3 times
---
1:45-2h is quite slow. It's just a game but that's not really a sound reason to not try or care. But it's cool if you and your guild are on the same level.
---
Here are some tips
---
*The Biggest Mistakes I See*
---
new Mages don't have a good feel for the range of their frost nova.  A new Mage will get too close to the mob to frost nova and subsequently get smacked and die. This is why they are never capable of taking on more than 3-4 mobs. The better you are at avoiding hits, the more mobs you can take on at once.
---
Another tip: When you are moving, due to leeway, your frost nova and aoe's have a larger radius, than compared to standing still.
---
*Gear*
---
Spell power doesn't translate well with Blizzard. A lot of mages have high stamina/int gear they use for AOE'ing. 
---
*Talents* 
---
There are 3 traditional methods. [flamestrike, coc] [blizzard,frost nova]  [blizzard/coc hybrid]. The talents you choose will be based on what method you want. As a newbie, I'd highly recommend the Blizzard, frost nova method. Ensure you have 3/3 Improved Blizzard, 2/2 Improved Frost Nova, at least 2/3 in Perma Frost. Perma frost isn't necessary but as a beginner, it helps give you a little more time. 
---
*PrePull*
---
Ice Barrier, drink to full and wait 20 seconds. . Make sure you have Rank 1 frost nova on your bar to reduce the cost of mana.
---
*Pull Tips*
---
Do Keep an eye on the "Immune" popping up on your screen when you are iceblocked. I like to exit iceblock a fraction of a second after I see a lot of "Immune's" on my screen. This will help prevent you from getting wrecked when you come out of the block. As you escape iceblock immediately frost nova and put on ice barrier as you run away and get to max distance. 
---
Blinking away vs running away after using frost nova. This is purely mana dependant.  Blink is expensive mana cost-wise. If you have the gear by all means blink. Otherwise, run max distance.
---
*The 2nd blizzard*
---
In general, you want to throw the 2nd blizzard just on top of the first few mobs, so the other mobs walk into the blizzard.  However, if they are not bunched up very well you can put the blizzard further up into the pack. Don't feel obligated to completely finish the 2nd blizzard if the mob pack gets too close. You just want them slowed enough to where you can use frost nova again and do it all over again.
---
*AOE ROUTE*
---
The optimum route in AOE'ing in an L shape. Mobs will break out of your frost nova at different times and their line towards you will elongate. By running around 90 degrees it will help reset their line. In ZF this sometimes means going against a wall, and your camera angle will completely change. It takes some getting used to. 
---
*The dreaded Resist*
---
Nothing is worse than seeing more than 1 mob resist your frost nova. Just blink and run away and reset. If only 1 mob resists, and you are in ZF you can throw up ice barrier as you run away and pretty much still get in 2 good blizzards with the mob beating on you and you will be fine. You could always cold snap and re-frost nova or iceblock in place, but when you rely on iceblock for pulls I don't like wasting 2 on 1 pull.
---
*Optional*
---
Cone of cold. I like using this as I run around the mob pack. It's better used if you have 3/3 in Improved Cone of Cold. If you don't have this talent, its probably mana inefficient.
---
Farm satyrs while you look for nodes, Felcloth sells decently and you're already running around Azshara. Winterfell frubolgs for firewater is good, but make sure with any consumables you farm to put them up before raid night for max gold
---
How long did each run take you roughly ?
---
If you want to be truly evil then downrank their Frostbolt. Use a macro so it shows the tooltip of their max rank Frosbolt but casts 1 rank lower. That way it goes unnoticed longer and they initially think they're crazy when they start figuring it out.
---
More like 20 on, 20 off.
---
Which is unobtainable unless youre **extremely** far from people since the radius it shares hks is huge. The only time ive gotten 220 from an hk in av was when i was fishing in the south and closest to me was in drek's room afk.  
---
Lets say a short win typically is 3k. So to get an extra 3k from 200 honor giving kills you need 13 kills. Spoilers, youre not going to find 13 different people roaming alone in the same spot you are. At 70 honor youd need ~42 kills, now thats a big number especially since you get ~70 honor when its like a 3v1.  
---
So in case it isnt obvious by now: 6k in an av is extremely unlikely. Im not saying its impossible, as ive gotten 6-7k in an av, but everytime I did my hks were super high like ~80+. You need to be really lucky and its not common.
---
&gt;Orc is a better choice for DPS warriors but no need to delete your troll.
---
most of the best weapon in game are not axes.
---
In order to get to sure footed, I have to spend 15 talent points on stuff that I would MUCH rather have in either of the other two trees. The survival tree has some good stuff for pvp, and stuff that can be good situationally for certain things, but I would never go 4 rows deep into survival unless I absolutely had to. I consider it 15 wasted talent points. And yes, the BIS list is comprised of stuff that all have hit on it, but if you don't need the hit, some of those are no longer BIS. I don't just grab items off that list, I work things out myself, and often times there are plenty of items that would just fit better that are nowhere near that list.
---
Combat isn't a modifier, it's a conditional. But yes, [combat] works fine for /cancelaura. Make sure the typo in the item name is fixed though, otherwise it won't work.
---
Or the orc pops racial.
---
OP failed at character creation screen by picking wrong faction.
---
I've been playing my shaman (48) and I swear the entire other team targets me.
---
During a game last night, 3 49 rogues *only* focused me. It was incredibly frustrating but satisfying at the same time.
---
I've watched both of these videos and they are extremely informative - I would recommend any and all GMs/LC members watch them. However, he declares WAY too many items as "tank prio," so people should use their own judgment on some of those so as not to create loot drama by ONLY gearing out the tanks. Yes, tanks should be favored for the sake of progression, but not for *everything.*
---
When you have 15+ min queues, its harder to get into the spirit of PvP in its current state as a horde.
---
....
---
This one is not cool
---
No one cares, not even Blizzard.
---
Assuming the Magey's table is correct, the difference between 305 and 308 weapon skill is (.4*.15) glancing blow penalty to (.4*.05), which is a 4% difference. I haven't looked at how much of my damage is purely from white attacks, but assuming you're not using heroic strike, that's probably an extra 1-2% overall dps increase.
---
Enslave - reign of fire with pet - dot each imp - health funnel demon
---
I hate the rush meta....it isn't fun. I find turtles fun. I love the back and forth of it all.
---
But then again, I am not min maxing, ranking chad wannabe.
---
You're wrong though. Enjoy being a middle of the pack parser with a elitist attitude though. Go for your 13% hit or whatever was the meta 3 years ago on unofficial servers that got a lot of things wrong. One scroll through the fight club discord would be enough for you to know you're wrong.
---
The first sound bite 'excuse me,' is Ace Ventura talking through his ass. Finally, watching that movie 400 times as a kid has payed off!

---
One of my favorite aspects of Alterac Valley is that the meta is in constant flux.  From morning to afternoon to night there are often different dynamics, and games going different ways.  Sometimes too many people defend and that causes problems for offense, sometimes there's no D and so on.  
---
The reason the Alliance won so much for the first few days is that all of the hardcore players who were pushing to get exalted with the stormpike.  These players came in and steamrolled their best winning strategy with solidarity - zerg to drek.  As these players hit exalted, the quit playing (as much) AV and moved on to WSG premades etc.  Now the people queuing on Ally side are the laggards (forgive me for the term, I'm a laggard as well) and they're much less  organized.  As u/Snowjob_tv put it very well, Horde have more incentive to win since we sit in long queues.  We're much more apt for a knock-down, drag-out fight than the alliance, who can afk after the first 10 minutes of the match, and be in another one before the first match concludes.  
---
I play AV for the fun of it.  I'll get exalted sooner or later, but I really love the tooth-and-nail fights where you are recalling to make turn ins, summoning flyers, taming wolves, and then rejoin offense for the final push.  I was in a game last night that went for 58 minutes.  Most of you would probably be pissed about it, but it was a blast.  At the end of the game, I had 120 HK's and 5.7k honor.   Looking at the allies totals, most had 0 because they joined the battle late.  One side is willing to fight the long fight, and the other is not.
---
Give it a few more days and the meta will flip on it's head again and there will be a different dynamic with the horde losing every game.  You'll see r/classicwow flooded with hordies posting "WTF happened bro we used to win AV wHy ArE wE LoSiNg nOw?"  It is the way of the game.  This is the way.
---
You explained the situation to him and theres nothing wrong with wanting to keep drops in-guild.  I don't think you did anything wrong.
---
Ninja booting someone once they get to the dungeon with no explanation is a dick move.
---
lol i always get people asking me "OMG How much does ur guild love you??" dual Deathbringers, QSR, onslaught, flameguard, ony neck, etc.  Truth is we just get a bunch of warr loot!  even our tanks are starting to get their own OEB's and flameguards.
---
Did we play deathroll back in vanilla as well? I can't remember but I'm having a blast with it right now
---
If your not having fun, you're doing it wrong.
---
Yes the fact at how angry they must be was what made me the happiest.
---
They are so incredibly well coordibated and good, they probably almost never lose. Only because they were uncertain about the 3 players in Dreks room did they lose.
---
As the few players were at drek people were all porting back and then there was a constant stream of 20-25 horde attacking them from behind which made them lose numbers. At some point they rushed in and got Drek almost down. At 20% their tank wiped and then he went down to 10% while killint everyone.
---
2h fury for leveling sounds like a mistake bro
---
He will definitely catch up when you go up the hill towards the road. You can use concussive and scatter and still be fine. When he gets low on health he slows down so be careful not to out range and reset him. Just finished my bow 3 days ago. Was super fun. Good luck!
---
Fury warrior, Human.
---
I have 3 weapons. Brutality Blade . the AV mace from being revered. and Mirahs song.
---
What do I want to equip and in which hand? Thanks!
---
Ahhh gotcha. I have not researched BWL content yet but that's interesting. Very excited for BWL releasing.
---
Why is it not a sound reason? Not having to stress is a reason not to care about being minmax in everything down to rushing mc. 
---
Not everything in life has to be quick and efficient.
---
Because at that point it would be a totally new class, dont you think? I mean think about how much aoe demon hunter has, *then* think of their mobility and survivability. That class would have to be broken down and rebuilt from scratch and just be DH in name only.
---
This zone is so beautiful. When you fly over the bay and the sun kisses the towers. God damn 15 years old and this game still kicks ass
---
Are you asking for a pat on the back?
---
Use binary search. Disable half. If the problem goes away, enable half of the disabled add-ons. If the problem did not go away, disable half of your remaining add-ons.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
What is crit cap when heroic strike/cleave is queued? For dual wield fury warriors with 305 weapon skill.
---
Cause you can duel right at the queue spot in TB, but more people just queue in arathi highlands from what I have seen.
---
&gt;So you’re telling me, you’d rather use a 1-8g potion than just tap and have a healer top you off?   
---
&gt; use demonic runes and major mana potions if you can 
---
If healers and tanks are bringing their consumes as well I think you really should be using Mana Pots, but for the Demonic Runes it only takes like 30 min at the most to farm the runes you need for one on every boss in MC.
---
About a month my guild opened up a 3rd raid to begin forming. I volunteered to raid lead as I thought my IRL friends would be able join me during the 3rd groups times. We had about 20-25 members from the guild, and about 15 pugs which isn’t an issue in and of itself. However, because we were basically taking anyone just to fill spots our composition lacked a single warlock. While I know and understand top tier groups consist of basically all melee players that can smash through MC, this Group was not a top 1% of the player bad type of group and therefore was severely punished due to the lack of warlocks. We got to Garr pretty easily as expected and wiped a few times as expected trying multiple strategies that just weren’t panning out. We decided to skip Garr and that’s when I myself realized how nice it is to have two purple mages in an MC Group. The trash packs before Geddon were an absolute nightmare. 20 dead each pack due to no banishes on the elementals that stun in a cone or whatever. It was hell on earth. We managed to go 4/10 after killing Geddon but with the looming trash packs in front of us we called it quits there. As a mage I now have more respect for my Purple brethren.
---
I love how well this game runs on laptops.  Great for getting that fix when you’re on the go.
---
Reading the comments confirms my decision to level an alt
---
Hi I think you responded to the wrong comment here. 😅
---
Crafters are limited by the gathering pool. There are only so many people out there farming any given material for any appreciable amount. Some things like Thorium will always be in great supply and low price because not many things actually use a lot of thorium, and plenty of people are mining it specifically for sapphires and crystals.
---
Another thing is that people use the AH for more than hawking their own profession goods. A significant amount of activity is arbitrage, meaning someone buys a lot at a certain price and either immediately relists, or holds it for a period of time and sells it. They can easily swallow a handful of crafter's entire week or more worth of output and effectively remove it from the market.
---
I plan to create a new character
---
That’s cool and all, but we’re talking about fury dps here, not tanking. And on the dps BiS list from the Fight Club discord daggers are mentioned for non-humans. Why are you being condescending?
---
That's the thing, the situation varies from group to group and pull to pull. If a healer is sitting there are FM then yeah I'd expect them to toss me a heal. But if I see them drinking ,then I know they're running low and I need to take care of my own green bar.
---
thats how to win as horde tbh. Alliance fall apart if they have to actually fight
---
I like bread heavy pizza, looks fine to me
---
That's easy - the value would be similar (or exactly the same) as going from 305 to 306 or 307 skill for comparison. Maladath, for example, would still require you to gear for 9% hit (as opposed to 6% if you reached 305 skill). Each weapon skill reduces glancing blow penalty by 4% until 307 skill (then only 2% from 307 to 308, and 0% afterwards) so Maladath would just reduce the glancing penalty by 16% (this translates into about a 25% increase in damage for your glancing blows).
---
The answer to your question lies within.
---
And the US president
---
I can’t even roll a alt cause I know there won’t be anything as fun as my warlock. Play warlock please man, I just want you to have the fun I’m having. You litterally feel like a raid boss, you would destroy any class in a 1v1, sometimes other players litterally feel likes mobs, it’s awesome
---
"confromation" made me lol
---
Think of AV as a prioner's dilemma. Horde has a queue of 10 - 30 mins, ally is instant. 
---
Thus ideal game length for horde is roughly 20 mins. 
---
Ideal duration for alliance is "as short as possible"   but the minimum game duration is 12 -15 mins to kill all LTs, cap all towers, etc.
---
If both sides go for their best option, we get a turtle at Galv/middle. 
---
However ideally: 
---
Horde lets alliance get Galv 
---
Alliance lets horde get Vanndar
---
Both sides let the other kill LTs and cap towers.
---
Then both sides get lets say 15m games, Horde gets near max honor, so does alliance. Horde gets slightly shorter queues. 
---
This also means ally solo rankers get a better shot against premade rankers.
---
The best meta is cooperation.
---
Depends, only tine I will drain or siphon is if I'm taking damage because I pulled, or if we're on easy pulls and I want to generate some extra hp to tap back down again while still contributing to doing damage. As part of a regular rotation though, nope.
---
So spend 10 hours a day for months? 
---
No one reasonable is trying for rank rewards during this first zerg
---
You can trade rares in raid too
---
Turn in santas quest!
---
I can't confirm if it is something that is still possible, but back in the day you'd have been able to queue for a battleground at level 59, ding to 60, learn all your skills/equip all your 60 gear, then be in that one battleground against everyone at a significant advantage.
---
I've got a 43.5 dps 2h staff - but I'm an Orc so I'm looking for that next Axe upgrade. I use that slam macro, so I wonder if I would benefit from additional AP. This is my first main ever, so I do feel like a soup sandwich sometimes, talents all over the place, etc etc lmao
---
I don't mind healing locks life taps, but if I'm sitting there drinking and they are at 5% health and not even attempting to do it themselves, that's annoying. "I'll just life steal next pull"... Proceeds to never life steal
---
Woah there Satan.
---
Best way to avoid decay is to play, sadly.
---
Depends on the name you want and the server its gonna be on
---
no because most of my friends are jerking each other off while playing av premades just cause its better honor, im leveling a new alt and waiting for them to get bored of it and go wsg
---
Unless he gets into the top AV premades it's still somewhat true :P
---
If you are heavily outnumbered and have a low horde pop.  Find a cross realm BG premade group, farm up your tanks prior to moving and get some really awesome gear/mount.  It will only take a few weeks of work to save months if you pursue on a high pop server.
---
My Classic lock is the first time I've ever taken it, I passed on it several times during vanilla, but after experiencing how awesome it was in TBC I thought I'd give it a shot. Honestly, Dark Pact is amazing. The impact it has on your grinding speed cannot be overstated. It's also been a huge boon for instance runs since I'm not putting nearly as much pressure on the healer mana, so for easier pulls I can just toss out my dots, dark pact back to full, and be full health and mana without the healer even knowing.
---
I'm honestly starting to wonder if it is even a viable raid talent. Yeah its slower than life taping, but you also don't have to bandage yourself and you don't have to go low hp risking a random death. I guess it really depends on your healers and how much time they have to throw the locks a regen.
---
90 day cooldown on transferring
---
I think of a lowbie someone who is 5 or more lvl below you. I think as far down as 4 lvls, while not completely fair, there's still a good chance that person can win.
---
The premade? Yeah the majority went afk after being wiped. Else they would've won. I banked on them going afk after wiping tbh.
---
Some people just dunked on the content too hard for it to be fun for this many weeks. Interest will be back with BWL, and honestly the ebbs and flows make the game more interesting.
---
What the issue has been since day 1 is simply unmanaged expectations, leading people to become disillusioned and unhappy. Just take a couple weeks off, come back and find something perpendicular to do, like twinking or rolling alts
---
At low levels dual wield arms with imp over power is really nice
---
I'd even use my work phones hot spot 😅
---
Honestly I was levelling up my hunter just to do this. I killed hundreds in org back in vanilla by doing this. Even kited 2x3 packs to really get the job done. Where exactly do they despawn? Did it happen within 3 seconds of hitting them last? I remember back in the day having issues. Whenever there were guards on them if the guard died and nothing else was attacking right after, they would despawn. I got around this by attacking immediately after guard kills (rank 1 arcane shot or distracting).
---
Is it possible it could be something like that? How far do they make it in org before despawn? Is it always the same spot?
---
Yeah any post will find it's viewer, you're not wrong. Those "I got some loot" or "look at this sunrise" are meh too. It's ok tho, you can post whatever you want just think twice if people really want to see it.
---
Language is important here.  This community calls World of Warcraft prior to any expansions "Vanilla."  Classic is a different thing.  Classic was never going to be Vanilla 2.0 and was never sold in that way.
---
I wanna say yes...
---
But these profits are often entirely unrelated to professions on bigger servers. Like on alliance mograine the difference between mats and potions is zero and often the pots are cheaper than mats.
---
You could the "buy low, sell high" thingy just without alchemy and be better for it for mats for example. Alchemy lets you move more goods in theory because you can sell both mats and pots at the same time, but often clicking the "craft" button with alchemy is straight up losing gold.
---
It does become a problem when locks use life tap as a substitute for bringing their own drinks so they can steal the healers cash.
---
On route... 66
---
You two and 60%of the horde pvpers
---
Yuuuup. 1000 runs at 5 runs per hour is 8.3 *days* of game time.
---
At 100 runs, given a 1% droprate (14% for Gorvosh, 7% for glad chain = 1%) there is a 63% chance you've seen 1 SGC drop.
---
At 1000 runs, there is a 99.9% chance you've seen 1 SGC drop.
---
&gt;Clearly you are too stupid to put two and two together.
---
Hey just because you don't understand how raid options work doesn't mean you need to get upset like this. Grow up 
---
&gt;They already have made an edit to change the variables for AV raid groups and their loot that cannot be changed by players in game.
---
They just changed the default raid option and locked it. If you can't understand why using a default setting is simple compared to creating one then you simple shouldn't be engaging in this conversation.
---
&gt;I’m not sure if you are really this stupid or just another troll.
---
Again, the only person struggling with raid options here is you. Name calling that won't change that.
---
You don’t have to play for rank you know
---
I do not believe it gets extra to drop. You fail on high level stuff less often but nothing extra.
---
If your dungeon group is cruising along, your dots are mostly wasted mana. Corruption is often ok. SL and CoA are too slow in almost all cases. But you don't have to use the same rotation every fight.
---
Full mana? Shadow bolt for the dps. Low mana? Tap, then bolt. Low hp? Lose dps for a fight or two and drain life to heal up. As a lock, you can be ultra low maintenance for a group and crank dps if someone decides to heal as you tap
---
Did u try appealing a namechange first?
---
What I’ve seen people do to force a name change is as follows: delete your character, create a new alt with that name, then restore the old character. It should force a name change since there’s now a character with the old name.
---
You might want to double check this though.
---
"smaller fights" didn't exist on most servers when phase 2 launched. Any even matched fight would be interrupted by a bunch of the majority faction on the server coming to wipe out the small group because honor was so competitive. It got to the point where most of the minority faction players quit or transferred to avoid being corpse camped in their own capital city. Phase 2 launch was awful.
---
Don't lie, you die randomly in the trap room still.
---
&gt; when I KNOW FOR A FACT I attempted that probably HUNDREDS of times during retail and never got past maybe 1 or 2 elites before dying
---
&gt; Maybe your fkn memory just sucks
---
Why on earth would you attempt to run the stockades so many times solo?  A hundred deaths?  Really?  Really?  Who's memory is fallacious now?
---
31 vs 25 elites isn't much to brag about due to high armor from inner fire, pw:shield, and good heals from holy.  We'd be more surprise if you struggled at that point.
---
I'm calling you a liar because there is zero difference in the low level experience.  No damage was adjusted, no gear was buffed, no nerfs to dungeons made.  So if Blizzard didn't nerf stockades nor buff priest at level 30, you are lying about your experiences.
---
Yup. the double back door, is why I dont understand how the horde ever loses in AV.  D to force a turtle, then back door Dun Baldur. its basically impossible to lose with this strat. Even if it means the BG takes a bit longer then a fast loss /shrug
---
Hey what does Bob mean lol, i dont play pvp much
---
Rogue here too. I've never seen a brutality blade or a viskag, or nightslayer bracers/belt. Sad.
---
I wish salt was currency, because holy shit I need mount money.
---
Do you realize that even private servers ran on the 1.12 patch because it's universally agreed that it was the best patch in terms of balance?  Sounds like you never actually played Vanilla and have no idea what pre 1.12 was like and are just making wild assumptions as a result.  Go argue with the Nostalrius devs that 1.12 is bad and see what they say.
---
lmao what a bday gift
---
Well let's say you don't heal to full and are able to throw 2 hots on yourself. You might heal maybe 1000 hp if you are lucky. Thats 4 mobs with 250 threat. Yes that is more then nothing but that is 1 hit from literally anything. So it's really not worth it for the time and effort involved. Easier to just pull and demo roar
---
Go outside, you aren’t getting r10, give up
---
Then go ahead and try it.
---
Personally I *cannot* do it because I know I'll just play games when I should be working. It's the same reason I cannot work from home.
---
Not necessisarly. Sure you're making the current fight take longer, but eliminating dungeon downtime is a net time gain. No reason to spam shadowbolts on that last mob when you could just be tapping and bandaging to be ready for the next pull.
---
Are you horde on Myzrael?  Sounds like my guild.  So much mage stuff drops for us it is crazy - we literally have seen at least one Mage T2 helm/week on Ony for like 10 weeks now.
---
I'm surprised they even let Druids in the raid...
---
I'd have felt bad about it too, but if the entire rest of the group was a guild group it makes some more sense. You did the right thing by being nice about it and especially by offering to pay for the trouble. As DPS they should be able to get another group pretty easily.
---
You want 5% hit and ideally ~25% crit (~30% with axe) at current gear levels. Currently you don't really need more HP than in the ~6K range if you have a healer backing you up. Full tank gear would probably put you close to or over 7K. Pieces like SGC and Crown of destruction are most definitely BiS atm because of the stats they provide, even though they're mail pieces. Spaulders of valor are also better than pauldrons of might in most cases thanks to the extra offensive stats at the cost of just a little stamina. If you have access to it, the boots and the legs of the blue PvP set are really good too. Just remember that crit is king.
---
Or just have your tank's go dual-wield fury prot.  Any guild currently pumping 12k+ dps on tank n' spank bosses in MC will likely kill vael in 75 seconds or even less.
---
And then sell all but one rune, so they're forced to wander around Darn looking for a reagents vendor.
---
Orc are the best entry level dps but once u reach aq and naxx gear trolls will pass them because the best weapons are all swords so both races need edgemasters or sword skill and the troll racial is stronger than the orc racial.
---
Let them die, the power is yours
---
almost have my priest alt at cap, and after healing for so many years. now i just tell locks you're welcome to life tap but it doesn't mean you're gonna get healed. or just because you can life tap doesn't mean you should. then I throw a renew on em if im in the mood and if they die too bad.

Doesn't really matter if things are "really common", I had a mage in the guild that needed 30 or so Jed kills to get briarwood reed, and I believe that is a 1 in 3 chance to get. Unluckiest guy,
---
AH is sorted lowest buyout to highest in auctionator, why is this an issue?
---
Just found a video of a 31 preist in damn near the same gear as me, trying to solo ONE level 26 elite in stockades, and it took him 5 tries, and only won because he got lucky basically...
---
I just ran in and killed 3 without even going OOM this time, you're wrong
---
How do you play this? Two people put money down and first to one loses?
---
It's an issue for people without addons
---
I just play with the default one. The game itself is enjoyable enough for me
---
Lol Treesus
---
Would be very interesting to see if author will add a part about exploiting enrage. Basically getting intentionally hit and using a sit/stand macro that abuses spell batching to guarantee getting crit upon. Will be a niche circumstance regardless as you don't want to obviously be taking damage, but there may be a few boss fights where you can probably abuse it to parse really high.
---
The macro I found for this is:
---
#showtooltip  
---
/cast Feed Pet  
---
/cast [pet] 0 1  
---
This works if the food is in the first bag slot of your backpack.
---
Based on your current macro, try removing the :Cat/Ravager from the 2nd line, change /use to /cast. If it still doesn't work, it might purely be because you can eat Roasted Quail, so try with a food that you can't eat.
---
​
---
Ppl i guess dont understand that the first 2 weeks of av screw with all honor calcs, and its been like this literally through the last 5 vanilla servers. Should be regular after tuesday
---
oh thanks!
---
I just linked to the thread from an AMA where blizz literally said they were going to mirror it to Pre-nerf settings as close as possible, that is now proven untrue.  Arguments over
---
At 50 your almost ready for BRD.  Doing arena/angerforge runs will allow you 4 easy and qui k lockpicking lvls just opening the 3 doors and spinning the wheel.  Repeat 5 or 6 times and you'll be maxed out.
---
Hey was wondering what the CD on renew is? And is it mana efficient to spam it on a lock. I usually let the priest know that a renew every now and then if fine for me. Just wanted to know if it’s an efficient thing to do from a priests perspective. Never played a priest before.
---
i'm not sure if you can do a /castrandom and a /cancelaura in the same line of command
---
Yeah that’s generally why addons exist, I’m literally offering you a perfect solution
---
Same, although it's usually mixed. I do a generic macro in the overall tab that other classes will find useful, then build the specifics out in each character tab.
---
OK, in "this keeps getting weirder" news:
---
The macro in its current form works... but only when it's bound (as far as I've tested) to the numerical keys. If I put the macro in my main bar (at the moment they're set to a second bar that's visible in all forms) in the slot that has number 6 assigned it works when I hit the number 6. If I then also bind E for example to that same slot... it doesn't work.
---
The following image shows what I mean:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/bq2w2g4](https://imgur.com/a/bq2w2g4)
---
You'll see Regrowth assigned to 6 on the bottom bar (which is the main paged bar for my forms) as well as E on the top bar (where it would normally be). Same macro works when I hit 6 and not when I hit E, and if I change the E binding so that it's on the same button as 6 is also doesn't work (but continues to work when I hit 6).
---
So the macro is clearly fine, there's some other fuckery going on here that makes zero sense.
---
(continued thanks to everyone for the suggestions)
---
Alliance aren’t going to quickly leave for a 15m debuff on their insta queues
---
Arbiters Blade is *bad*.
---
Really bad. The Maraudon sword (1% crit) is better and soloable so I would recommend that. Witchblade is nice, but you'll likely get a Mageblade or, at least, Sorcerous Dagger sooner rather than later. Hell, I'm a fresh 60 Friends/Family mage in a competitive guild and got a Sorc Dagger first run.
---
Check out Grob
---
I’m not dueling outside org until ZG patch. Just don’t see the point unless I have the gear for a fun engaging duel. Lots of others feel the same way. Late vanilla it’ll be duel central when people are in great gear
---
This is legendary
---
When done right it doesnt slow your pull down and you still do demo roar so it's just additonal threat upon everything else. Sure a lot of times it doesnt make a difference but a lot of times with aoe happy dps in party every bit will count.
---
It’s almost as if the honor system is a shitty.
---
right. my point was that there's basically no money to be made in adding value by processing materials, so you shouldn't do it in hopes of making money later
---
now, the natural counterbalance is that transmutes hold some value because they have long cooldowns, but I predict that over the life of a server that value will decrease as supply increases and demand decreases. so at least for now alchemy does do something by itself, for itself, but the price of xmutes is already in the "couple gold a day" range which is pretty negligible.
---
blacksmithing and leatherworking and cooking seem to be actually just worthless, having no value not tied to market price discrepancies.
---
your point in that the money is in timing of buying and selling is entirely true: however you don't need any profession whatsoever to do that, you can do it with a level 1 bank human who walks to stormwind and paces a rut in the stone between the ah and mailbox
---
The guy said that daggers are only viable for tanking. I then asked him why the Fight Club would recommend them for dps, and then you're telling me I'm an idiot/troll and that I should fuck off. You're really giving off some angsty teen and or /r/iamverysmart vibes.
---
Warrior used gnome shrink on rag. Noone could reach the boss. We wiped
---
Sounds good, do they have a lot of raid activity going on? even daily would be nice just to pug until I found a good guild
---
It's true.
---
I'm a Bob and I love a good Alliance turtle.
---
Horde is very strong on Blammo as well with tons of guilds 10/10. Just they outnumber alliance so prepare for what comes with that.
---
That Mage was pure comedy
---
Renew is on gcd and instant cast. It’s pretty bad as far as mana efficiency goes, which is why I give you locks a level down renew.
---
It’s annoying and you shouldn’t use our mana as your mana. Especially don’t life tap mid large butt pull when we’re nearly oom.
---
Just drink water.
---
Add a condition where if a party member is targeted (or to select the nearest friendly?) you cast Divine Intervention. 
---
Holy paladin with no druids or priests in group: "Ok guys, thanks for the lava run! :clicks hearth:"
---
:(
---
thank you
---
I main Druid, so they gotta take the long way back to
---
In a guild leader too and those fear wards are real nice in ony. Right now everything is ez mode but when new phases hit then having people who play their class correctly will be imperative.
---
Hit has nothing to do with glancing blows lol.
---
Level as fury. You can tank all content just fine.
---
Depends on your spec, i leveled feral and play balance/resto at 60. Feral set is in my bank mostly now, balance set i bring out for fun in av but mostly i use my resto set
---
It is scientifically proven that pve players have less hormones due to tinier genitalia. The lack of testosterone especially leads to longer reaction times and less situational awareness. If you add everything up you inevitably come to the conclusion that pizza is superior to spaghettis.
---
Nice, thank you! Clears all that up for me 👍
---
Nothing I hate more then lifetapping to half and starting to canni and I get a full heal and the healer whispers me "dude I need to save my mana for the tank". Then don't fucking heal me lol.
---
I'm a simple healer, I see missing health, I heal. In a dungeon, this is a no brainer most of the time. But In a raid, if I'm a tank healer my eyes are for the tank only.
---
There are always going to be some flaws with taking a complex system and throwing a few assumptions on top of it to boil it down into something more simple.  In general, I'd say you're largely correct, but there are outliers that will buck your trend, and most of them are related to 'getting ahead' of your competition.
---
Specifically, when crafters get early access to rare recipes, they can make a LOT of money, but it relies on them getting early access to something that is very limited, like lionheart helm plans, +healing and +spell power enchants, flasks, etc.  When the number of crafters who can make something is more limited, the rarity of the ability has value.  What you're describing above is more accurate for crafters who have access only to widely available recipes.
---
Similarly, if you know something is coming that will spike demand, if you get in on it early, you can make decent money.  For instance, making FAPs before open world pvp was released, Cindercloth/Onyxia scale cloaks before BWL, etc.  The trick there is that others are probably thinking the same thing, so it's very tough to tell when 'early' is too early vs. when it's exactly the right time.
---
I mean.. I suppose Farming as a pally would be tedious and boring af.. so yeah, i guess setting it up to farm while at work or something makes some sense.. (except eventually you will get banned.. so don't people usually use a throwaway account?)
---
That's fair, i just prefer playing the AH as opposed to actually farming.
---
Lol what? It's the exact opposite
---
I mean man, undead rogue life! I love ganking lowbies haha. You stalk an area and instill fear of future ganks, enough that they call in their 60 friends. Then the real PvP begins!
---
Would you keep the same TBC loot skins for karazan?  or would you have them design new loot that was more in line with classic themes?
---
You could do the dumb thing and DE everything now and get laughed at later for being to stupid, or you could DE everything later on at zero risk and possibly make out like a bandit.
---
I wish. I do only bang bbws though
---
(assuming it is like the eu equivalent) there are a lot of active guilds from which many pug a free members it's Really not a problem although our first rag took a few more resets than the very first
---
Then you guys are good to go. You have plenty of dps. Rest is just new mechanics.
---
I hate life tapping to 65%, I begin cannabalising and the **druid** heals me with **healing touch**.
---
Gotta love the people trying to call you out.
---
If you are attempting to rank you are most definitely forced to do AV.
---
I'd like to see both the honor from AV nerfed and the weekends added personally.
---
like others have said, it can be clutch for black lotus picking but not much else.
---
0 hit, yikes!
---
Sounds good man, glad to hear that it's viable.
---
If this were true one might assume that you'd have a hard time 1v1 someone who knew it was coming, the opposite is true.
---
Rogue- Sneak around and stab stuff.
---
Leatherworkers make mail pieces too.  
---
However, as cool as it is to make your own armor, leatherworking is one of the worst professions (behind blacksmithing).  Engineering or alchemy will be much more useful to you.
---
Pve raid heal (max +healing), pvp/dungeon heal (more int, stam and armor) and bear tanking.
---
This is one of my favorite things about druid sometimes
---
I prefer Prat over ElvUI's chat
---
Leveling bots are probably done to sell the capped character, not to farm anything.
---
Dont see the point? Sounds like you only want a fun engaging duel if it means you have a leg up. In reality, your duels will not be much different then compared to now because everyone will scale. You're missing the whole point of duels. Have fun, learn and improve.
---
Wyrmhide Spaulders
---
It's the most evil thing I could ever imagine. :')
---
Don't forget having to stand around and do literally nothing for a few seconds after a crit!  Ripping aggro off the tank is no fun.
---
Thanks man. I appreciate this type of editing isn’t for everyone but I made it the way I like these kinda vids. Glad you enjoyed it also!
---
Assuming you are a warrior i would level to 60 as arms, do dungeons to get ur pre-raid bis tanking as arms... then respec fury. If u are good at the game, and do your rotation properly, u will likely pull aggro off of average tanks a LOT. Tell the guild that you have your heart set on tanking but u will do whats best for the group. Keep topping the meters. Keep pulling aggro. When bwl hits they will make u a tank (or sooner) at which point you should respec to furyprot and be both the MT and pretty high on the dmg meters.
---

Question on earning money through the gathering professions, namely Herbalism
---
So I'm starting a fresh alt on a different server and I want to start earning and saving gold for my mount at 40. Is it worth it to get a gathering profession and earn money through it while on the journey to 40?  My last toon I pretty much just saved money and the rest of the gold was given to me through IRL friends who were playing longer on that server. I won't have that option here. 
---
Can anyone give tips on what I'm supposed to do to earn through Herbalism? Do I AH the early herbs or vendor them? Not quite sure what to do with the herbs. Or would Skinning be easier? I read that you pretty much vendor the scraps and light leather.
---
I mean, if you're Alliance and not doing premades, like 90% of games are over the second we wipe to Galv. I'm not going to go on defense when we haven't been able to cap a single tower, and I already tried to push south with the other three competent players in this BG. Since I like to pretend that Horde can slamdunk an easy win within the next 15 minutes, I'm not going to abandon. Better to spend that 15 minutes raising my fishing skill.
---
I mean, the current queue times only exist because horde are turtling and "going slow". 
---
The faster the games are, the more alliance players there are to roll out new games for the horde which = shorter queue times for horde.
---
Horde do themselves a disservice by turtling and slowing down the games.
---
Did get some weird pop-up from an addon, must be it... Thank you:)
---
BWL and AQ will kill a few guilds, and Naxx will kill most of what's left.  The PVE content gets A LOT harder!  MC fights are basically "one mechanic" fights.  Lucifron = everyone needs to dispel.  Geddon = melee out during AOE fire, and bomb person better run away!  
---
Compare that to even the first boss of BWL where one person has to control the boss, there are tons of constantly spawning trash adds coming from all angles, and everyone has to be on point with positioning, aggro, and mana usage to have enough puff left at the end to take him down.  That boss by himself is more mechanically challenging than anything in MC and it is the first boss of the raid.  
---
Then Chromaggus / Nefarian are very detailed fights as well.  Sure, veterans of the raid will not have much trouble but any first timers, even with experienced leadership, will have to learn and adapt to the fight and it wont' be rainbows and unicorns. 
---
AQ20, AQ40 and Naxx take this concept further.  
---
ZG is kind of the exception, some fights are tricky but it's not too complicated.
---
I've seen a lot of Druid tanks HoT themselves pre-pull for the extra aggro plus the HoT certainly doesn't hurt to keep them healed as they work up their threat. I always thought it was a nice strategy.
---
Yep, every healer who doesn't use addons like Clique is going to use character specific macros.
---
Also, as a druid main who plays all specs... please Blizzard, more macro slots :( Half my general macro slots are druid-specific ones.
---
Warlocks have minimal downtime as it is, because they can tap after the fight.
---
If we are talking speed runs, then even warlocks will be popping major Mana pots and demonic runes to minimize life tap GCDs.
---
This isn’t smoke, it’s steam! From the steam clams we’re having!
---
it wouldnt, but he's probably thinking of Castsequence.  
---
Cast sequence is one that casts in order.
---
if you hit the character limit with something simple like hex a bunch of times and lava burst once then if it looks like this Hex=X LB=O
---
XXXXXXXOXXXX
---
When you log in it will cast hex  for the first 7 times then Lava Burst once then hex 4 more times, but if you logout and log back in(maybe loading too) will reset the cast sequence back to 1.
---
You can also do some cool stuff like have it reset after X amount of second, if you switch a target, if you change combat status etc.
---
BUT castrandom, it doesnt matter how it's ordered as it just takes one of them and casts it
---
so XO would be 50/50 change of casting either
---
XXXO would be 75% hex and 25% lava burst etc.
---
Right, but horde have long queue times and would usually spend them outside dueling.
---
Healer should say thank you to him! Healers gotta parse too my dude!
---
&gt; They just don't look as strong as their male counterparts.
---
That's a reason to play them. Choosing to play a weak looking character has some style. And can give you an advantage.
---
We can't see usually that you're using a bandage unless we click on your frame and see the debuff, or if we actually watch your character in game do the motions.
---
I meant shoulders, sorry.
---
I barely hear you through that pokeball, but i say just roll with it bro! If you cant see the funny in it, send him a serious pm explaining it actually bothers you... hes proboly more joking with you than actually bullying you
---
My alt's guild still can't even figure out how to kill Rag. They put melee shamans and druids in with the melee and wonder why everyone is getting wrecked by fire splash dmg. They make the melee dps step out every 6 secs for hand of rag. Takes for fucking ever, everything goes to shit when submerge happens :/
---
tl;dr - When:  Always.  Why:  It's fun.
---
I think this is false - certainly it is a major contributor, but I'd be willing to bet that there are more Horde queing than alliance at the moment. Naturally it's nothing that can be proved, but still.
---
Horde who want reputation as well as honor may do the alliance a disservice denying them a quick win, but for them longer games (which are often wins) pay off.
---
my last mc run, I was the only person that healed myself on my lock on rag, and I was the only lock alive at the end. I would love for a hot now and then
---
Yeah I'm trying to decide on an alt...I didn't want to make another pure DPS at first since I'm already a Rogue but I really want a mage for farming now lol
---
Skinning is free money and you should vendor all leather, unless you find a buyer outside of the AH. The AH fee for leather is so high that it is very risky to put it up there. There is also an abundance of leathers compared to leatherworkers. 
---
I don’t have any personal experience with Herbalism, other than that the low level herbs are very cheap. 
---
One tip for you: Fishing. Find pools of Oily Blackmouth in almost any zone (even as low as The Barrens) and fish them. They sell for a high value on AH. In any pools you also have a chance to find Stranglekelp, which also is expensive right now.
---
Better would be making it a portal to Darnassus. Very likely to trick at least one person in the group.
---
Naughty
---
I will have to look at that. My guild has been saving them to my knowledge
---
Pickpocket brd arena spectators. 2 minutes to pp the mobs then set the ingame stopwatch. When it hits 8 minutes the loot resets and repeat. Sell your junk to the vendor in grim guzzler when your bags are full then go right back to the farm loop. Watch anime or look at memes in the reset downtime.
---
In raiding there should be very few life taps going out. Major mana pots and demonic runes are your friend.
---
&gt; I don’t want to tell people how to play, but unless something is punching me, all I truly need is the occasional HoT.
---
Direct heals are more mana efficient than a HoT so if the healer is throwing you a direct heal, they're trying to save mana.
---
I hope his pet is named Hound.
---
It’s about attitude. If the lock is doing this and a dick let him die. If he’s cool and doesn’t act entitled to my mana he gets heals
---
You're correct. And we downrank. So healing someone from 65% can be 100% Mana efficient and not overheal. I don't get that part of the complain tbh.
---
But you can't wear all those items as you're wearing 8 pc gs and that talent spec is anything but decent unless your guild is absolute trash, you'll spend waaaay too much time ressing your pet.
---
You're right, wiping ally at galv is the bad move. Best case, ally spawn at shgy and harass our push at icewing, recap sh bunker, or a couple go on D. Worst case, dumbass bob the orc caps sh and the whole game is immediately and utterly fucked. Been trying to do my part on horde side by spamming my "Four rules for a HELPFUL defense", of which the first two are "Do NOT wipe ally at galv".
---
It's always other peoples' fault, isn't it?
---
That was an issue in like the first week of classic. Almost every group I do now for anything is competent with very few issues.
---
My premade didnt win trade at all.And that was bannable and some guys didnt get away with it Blizzard was way more strict in monitoring then had better support and less players to monitor.Even now Blizzard bans win traders like they banned Olympus guild members win trading in cave
---
T1 hunter shoulders on an orc are unbearable...I like like a walking bellend.
---
I took a lot of heat from my guild for not hitting 60 the first week. Now they're trying to grasp how I find time to play so many chars when every night is raid night
---
Or if he’s a healer, replace them with higher level ones!
---
Tfw calling someone a clown = triggered snowflake
---
Post the video
---
That's the first thing in game I got to 300.
---
I mean its not going to hurt anything. But it's also not a "OMG BROKEN STRAT. WHY IS NO ONE DOING THIS!!!!" Type of idea.
---
You know where I can find the open ones?
---
Probably not possible for you, but there are a few quests you turn in while dead (ghost), so dinging then would be cool.
---
Anyone could have stopped bidding, not just him.
---
the one downside to being horde
---
I remember when I accidentally did that on High King Maulgar. Misdirected onto the tank and accidentally hit multi shot...
---
yeah this ! got it after some testing :D
---
Are you on a low pop server or something? There is always people doing dungeons on my server.
---
Not if you’re a warrior.
---
On gehennas theres atleast 10+ dueling at all times during daytime. Usually its between 20-30
---
I think every healer that complains about warlocks lifetapping should go play a warlock for a bit.
---
My friends are too overprotective of their whack station to leave it unattended
---
Like all things it's situational -- you gotta read the room.
---
I was healing a dungeon yesterday where I never got below about 75% mana.  Tank was on the ball, DPS was melting everything.  Perfect situation for the 'lock to convert health into aggro.
---
But if the healer is consistently going OOM or close, and every pull is leaking runners...just no.  Save your health for when something tries to eat you, and save my mana for other stuff.
---
The healers job is to keep the tank alive, it’s the tanks job to keep the mobs hitting them, and it’s the dps job to not get hit.  If I can, I will heal, but you’re bottom priority, if you want to life tap to 1% you better not pull aggro til I get around to you.
---
Yeah I did a little bit of grinding leveling my warrior, I don't think it's that bad in short bursts but straight grinding any class from 1-60 sounds terrible.
---
Ulda is also not too bad if you do it as a higher level. I think I ran it 6 times because I really wanted one of the 2h'ers that drop at the end as they are pretty much the best till 51+, and I did not have that many problems at all. In that level range, you can have 60%+ DR from your armor pretty easily because level 40 plate is over scaled
---
Same, I don't normally group with randoms. If an orc tank does that I just let him die. Some lessons have to be learned the hard way.
---
We just summoned him in our last game. He spawned, started pushing and randomly despawned around TP??? . 
---
We already had the horde base with a small force, so we continue to drek anyway with a now way bigger force and then he randomly spawns in again INSIDE the West FW tower?? (he is the same size of the tower and the just sorta get drawn over eachother, it looks very buggy). 
---
He then walks out of the tower and into the drek room, just to stand there and watch us kill drek.
---
We have evolved to herb/mining in between queues.
---
Ye this happened to me, master looter threw me (a lock) tranq shot at random cause she thought all hunters already had it, but one didn't.  The only hunter we had on that night... Couldn't trade. Still managed Mag with no tranq so it was of no consequence.
---
I misspell things, dont make fun of me :(
---
Being an asshole to your friends is funny.
---
Pro tip from your friendly neighbourhood healer - expect repair bills.
---
I do.  You said you mind controlled them once, not three or more times.
---
Bud.
---
Got some proof?
---
Joke's on you, I teleport from the spellbook like any true caster would
---
I  don't mind heal life tapping locks if there is a mage there to provide water, but i'm not gonna spend my gold because a lock wont drink.
---
Hahah bro if you dont think locks are more than capable in duels, idk what to tell you. It's not your spec. Again, have fun, learn and improve. Theres a reason you feel weak, it's because you haven't been practicing. You will be way behind come P4 when people have been training for months before you. You wont full understand all the nuances and mechanics of your class, wpvp/bgs only teach you so much. Dueling seems to be one of the best ways to really improve your skill, and I have many destro lock friends who are considered top tier pvpers. Lock is easily the most powerful duelist spec.
---
If your horde. Farm SM Cathedral. Easy money.
---
I don't know how many more times I need to say it, there are no changes to the mobs of the Stockades or any other dungeon.  The average power of characters while leveling is the same as it was in vanilla.  Slightly stronger due to better talents but otherwise still what it was previously.
---
But hey, I guess you are the first one to discover that the Stockades of all places is drastically different from what you remember.  It's not like half the playerbase is Alliance and would have noticed that one of the more popular leveling dungeons was way nerfed from both vanilla as well as private servers.
---
And another thing that is bugging me, claiming you didn't go oom killing three elites?  My priest at 60 goes oom after killing 3 equal level mobs let alone elites.  I'm going to call bullshit on your entire story from this point forward.  Either you are not using the spells of your class to dps and using a very good wand or you are making everything up.  And if you have spirit tap, that nullifies your entire story, as I can say with 100% certainty you didn't have that talent your first time.  Spirit tap is OP for leveling and having it vs your prior experience will make a massive difference.
---
TL;DR, stop talking about things that have already been analyzed, experienced, and passed over as 'good enough'.
---
Wait, what?  You have healing spells bound in AV?  In my experience you aren't supposed to do that.
---
Just sac your void Walker for health regen.  Makes things easier
---
If you hate PvP, don't sign up for PvP wargames?
---
&gt;	Not enough quests in classic to get to 60
---
That’s not true. At all.
---
Guilds that i've seen clear Domo / Rag on Sunday's, so usually doesn't take too long.
---
Lmfao so that's why everyone got pissed off at me when i capped the middle graveyard. I just started doing AV and wanted to complete the "Assault a Graveyard" quest objective
---
He would figure that out too quickly. Put it on dampen magic or something obscure.
---
...good times dropping  a Darnassus portal at the gate of AV during warmup as everyone is grouping.
---
All healers kind of operate similarly when healing the tank, so I won't address that
---
Druid raid healing is a buncha rejuv spam.  You want to make sure other druids aren't overwriting it, and you want to make sure other healers have an add-on that tells them your rejuv is up so they don't snipe the heal coming in a couple ticks.  It's slow but incredibly effective especially in scenarios where predictable aoe is happening
---
Priest raid healing is generally quick top ups and trying to find every opportunity possible to use a prayer of healing effectively.
---
As a druid if your raid leader is a jerk he may want you to innervate someone else, as well.  So bring lots more Mana consumables than you think.
---
That's perfectly *viable,* and I'm sure some raid groups are fine with that. But most guilds will not be running that setup and will probably be seeking out different classes for those roles. And eh, shamans are still superior raid heals IMO. Not to mention Ankh to res after wipes. That's why you have resto shammies.
---
I buy it; once my guild had had mc on farm the only potions i ever see used are arcane and fire resist on melee; my guild tends to favor DM buffs and other cheap alternatives. im a ret paly so i use them for the boost but my last 3 raids ive used nothing and never died.
---
Thanks I'll check out the fix. This is what I used previously but last I checked twitch didnt have an update for it, it looks like it does now, I'll just have to force it to update.
---
Hence my comment ... He wants to PvP not play av
---
Yeah, that’s a very different scenario than what I usually experience. Most groups the tank can’t get aggro, my wand does more damage than the dps, and the warlock is just spamming lifetap.
---
I'm skeptical that you can get exalted in one sitting with the way games are currently going.  Maybe 2 days.
---
Or ganking Alliance in the plaguelands.
---
in the guides ive watched they pulled him with the eye and killed him at the pool surrounding theredras. its to speed up the run and also to avoid aggroing the patrolling elementals. How do suggest i do it without using the eye then?
---
In general, many priest healers is good and many druid healers is redundant (since they'll just be overwriting each others' HoTs).  On the other hand, if you *are* the only druid healer in the raid, it can make getting upgrades easier since many of the Cenarion pieces are healing-focused.  As a druid healer, your job would be keeping HoTs rolling on the tanks, B-rezzing a tank or tank healer if needed, innervating as needed, and decursing.  As a priest healer, you'll either be assigned a tank to be primarily responsible for or you'll be 'raid healing' -- topping up all the dps/tank healers and using group heals as needed.  You'll also be decursing as needed.  If your +healing is better than other priests, you might be assigned to be the renew priest (again, like druids, you only want 1 or 2 priests casting renew b/c better renews overwrite worse ones).   Functionally, they're similar, so it really comes down to whether you can get one of the 1-2 spots available as a druid healer (which means easier gearing) or not.
---
Dude bears take very little damage in dungeons, lol.
---
You’re the second person to write this in this thread and I’m concerned.
---
a lot of guild have more than one raid team. Im sure you can find a guild that needs a tank to raid
---
What's the alternative to having melee step out? My guild clears rag in phase 1 and that's what we do.
---
But what time?  7 am pst?
---
I have never seen the kind of stalemate you describe.The few games we did take SHGY, half of Alliance went AFK shortly thereafter and we just continued stomping them all the way to Vann. Longest games I had was actually 20 Allies camping the chokepoint in front of SHGY between Balinda and IW bunker, keeping both sides too weak to do any meaningful progress forward. Paradoxically, taking SHGY is exactly how you break this kind of stalemate.
---
That sounds far too familiar lol
---
Don't worry I only use them to heal myself and NPC's.
---
Did not know you could use spell ID numbers in macros. TIL, and I’ve been mageing since TBC.
---
Lol you just keep assuming things about me. I’ve played SL warlock in vanilla 15 years ago and on henh0use everyday for a year leading up to classic release. I have dueled as a warlock probably more than anyone and that isn’t even hyperbole. I stopped playing soul link out of boredom because it’s just unfair. The spec I like needs more gear to be consistent the way I want. What is so hard for you to understand? Are you feeling okay?
---
Yess retails version of this is sending them to the blood elf starting zone. No flying and almost impossible to find your way out of you've never been there before
---
he hits the eye but he doesnt follow me after
---
Are you in Fusion? Long ass MC nights bro
---
Didn't realise I need more Rick n Morty wow cross reference memes
---
So all these elite guilds only clear Ony by using broken mechanics? Sounds about right.
---
I hope that guy at least had a good birthday. Aside from getting gkicked of course
---
Best horde can do without an obvious exploit involving the prospector npc in the bunker is by shooting Vanndar directly, then running out. Vanndar resets and the two center marshalls that came with him can be killed. After that Vanndar can be pulled without the two marshalls in the corners.
---
Still way slower than a full solo-pull though.
---
&gt; Direct heals are more mana efficient than a HoT so if the healer is throwing you a direct heal, they're trying to save mana.
---
I would like to add on that while this is true during leveling due to the scarcity of +Healing gear, Renew with downranking and sufficient +Healing becomes one of the most mana efficient heals for Priests. Without +Healing the base mana efficiency of Renew is actually worse than Flash Heal lol.
---
the one I am reffering to tried to be "blizzlike", so most of the prices from their price history has been within a factor of 2 of the real price.
---
It's peanut
---
spell, item and macros can all be accessed thid way. Pretty invaluable when writing longer macros. Especially if they contain "Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan" twice...
---
Good thing you were hanging back in the cave to take care of the AFKers. :D
---
I’m sorry to hear your experience on anathema isn’t going well. Mind if I ask what guild you’re in? I transferred off of whitemane to anathema and it’s been really great for me personally.
---
You should have never accepted that boost now you have sold your characters soul to the GM.
---
Do the question mark icon enter #showtooltip (spell here) and it will find the correct icon when you put it on your toolbar.
---
I never said that.  I just said Fear Ward is powerful and useful.
---
My favorite thing was back in WOTLK when we used to have to wait for the Wintergrasp portal to show up, I would cast a port to Stonard ontop of the Wintergrasp portal so half the raid would get teleported across Azeroth. Somehow we kept losing WG though :/
---
I heard they updated so eye cant pull anymore
---
They are nice. It gives dedicated people a chance to pull ahead of the non dedicated by grinding consecutive games.
---
Horde is no skill cap and you are just waiting for queue
---
I got an Asus that ran about $1200 from NewEgg and it’s great for everything from Fortnite to WoW right now and has a 17” screen.
---
Look for something from them around the price range in gaming laptops.
---
Pick up Band of the Great Tortoise for now if you don't have a second armor ring, it's extremely easy to get and will add some armor for you. Cloak probably costs 100g but is definitely worth it when you have that much. Why not make the trinket? Don't want to spend the gold? It's 100-150g well worth spending.
---
You should expect to eat/drink/bandage. You should also always life tap after pulls. Tell the healer you can heal yourself and to not worry too much about you. If they have the extra mana, they will heal you anyway.
---
I hit exalted on Sunday. After that, I did nothing but chilling around collecting herbs and fishing. My play hours have been much less too.
---
For shards, the Warpwood pod spawns are good.  Also the HellCaller packs.  I cast  CoA/Cor on all 5 imps, then a RoF.  As soon as enslaved casts his second RoF, just start sniping the imps for shards.
---
I switch my chat to guild only and I just play for fun. I'll try and take some towers, do a little pvp in mid catching stragglers, maybe I'll head back to base to defend.. I had a really fun 3v3 outside SH tower last night that lasted a few minutes it was really fun I dont even remember if we won or lost the game. 
---
Even though I'm not playing for peak efficiency I still just hit exalted and have close to 200k honor for the week.
---
Thank for the tips. Dont you need to be enchanter to make that trinket?
---
No you don't want crusader for PvP.  He's asking about PvP specifically.  Crusader is 1PPM, basically never provide any benefit in a PvP encounter.
---
just shadowbolt him, then immolate/doom, then run back up the hill, applying dots whenever possible and stopping to get some direct damage in whenever he uses the flamy gun ability thing.  If you keep to the edge of the ledge on the way up, you don't aggro anything at 60.
---
ahaha i was gonna day, that’s wild.  do it!
---
I don't think you can use the av weapon in a raid because of the debuff
---
Well some of the items are a reward for doing the scepter chain, which is gone.
---
I got my bonereavers last night to finally complement my bis and it’s fucking crazy. We were down like 7 people and I had to shot call and it was already loot councilled to me,  so happy it dropped!
---
You have BRE and you want to DW? Wait you're a gnome with BRE? Delete WoW already pls Blizzard!!!!!!!
---
It’s threat. Deep prot is better threat if you don’t have consumes AND world buff stacked. You basically have to have all that stacked to get the threat benefit of fury/prot, otherwise you’ll actual struggle more than deep prot.
---
&gt; Weapon skill gets more in to reducing the damage penalty from glancing blows
---
305 gives +3% hit and that's not trivial. Not the 9% difference we're seeing, but it's worth a third of it.
---
Fury prot MT should be using daggers (Perdition's Blade/Core Hound Tooth) with +5 dagger skill either from belt or gloves so as to not take rare high dps weapons from rogues/fury warriors.
---
Wait allies does pugs?
---
Yeah I do it at an inconvenience to myself just to annoy locks.
---
That's rogues in my guild, I think our 5 core rogues are sitting at 5/8t1, t2 helm and pants, and at least one weapon. Only rogue without a weapon is waiting on a viskag drop.
---
Yeah, I am. But AV aint that bad tbh
---
I would’ve bodied him but w/e LOL
---
Did you come from Grobb?
---
Depends on how much you're tapping. The locks that go to something ridiculous like 10-20% are assholes, because they're forcing heal to intervene or risk losing a dps to a stray attack. On the other hand if you're staying above 2/3-ish, then that's your prerogative, and if heal is trying to push you to 100% at the expense of the rest of the party instead of communicating like, you know, a human being, it's their problem.
---
I've seen both kinds occasionally, but most of the time "tap when I heal you, I heal you when I got mana to spare" works out nicely.
---
There is an addon called guild helper classic that does this and it's really good, the most difficult thing about it like most things in classic is getting 40+ people to use it.
---
Not in classic
---
My old guild used to invite alts and randoms to MC nights to make sure benedictions and rok'delars didn't go to waste. I mained warrior, but my hunter alt completed the bow quest line.
---
I know right? I use wayyy more character-specific macros than not.
---
True as they non elites. Great for a herber
---
Pretty sure Badlands has boxes in the dwarf fortress there
---
Neet
---
&gt;B) In Vanilla, dueling outside of Org was PVP to a lot of people, but the player base as a whole is more informed and concerned about min maxing than dicking around dueling outside of org.
---
I think that's a big part of it. Alot less people just chillin in Org now.
---
Even still, finding the icon in the icon list is a chore. showtooltip also makes the prank quicker, not only better.
---
Depends if BRM is camped 24/7 again. Especially the UBRS part, making attunement difficult. An unscrupulous group would only need to camp the area and tag the NPC every spawn to deny access.
---
No. No, people wouldn’t do that.
---
They sit in premades and talk on discord. PUG vs PUG horde usually wins because there are enough geared tryhard rankers on horde side and most of the tryhards in Alliance side are trying to queue together. I've only won one game against an Ally premade, and it was because we cheesed them at the start and then capped SHGY. They figured that it was more honor efficient to let us win and then requeue than to get deserter or attempt to win.
---
Lay on hands -&gt; Divine Intervention 
---
Could be fun too!
---
Go to Alterac Mountains where the AV vendors are. People are usually dueling while they wait in queue.
---
I've been doing that on my shaman while questing (only 48 but I love WSG).
---
Oh, what's this? 15 minutes queue? I can bust out a quest in that time!
---
I always try to bandage between LT, seems entitled to expect a heal.
---
do /reload when the button is not working. that should fix it
---
Calm down, satan.
---
If I don't make a group nobody else does on my server. Then I whisper everyone on /who and have one is 5 minutes. No clue why it is that way
---
We have gotten double judgement 3 of the last 5 weeks.
---
We DE bloodfang almost every week
---
Yes. I leveled enchanting to 265, crafted the trinket, and dropped it for alchemy. Takes a few hours and around 150g depending on your server. Easy to do though.
---
lmfao keep bitchin' about it.
---
- picks horde for PvP
---
- cries about queue times
---
You should probably quit.
---
Hard to find good help now a days. But that wasn't me
---
Yeah. This person it's actually a hero. They didn't contribute to the inflated honor requirements levied onto actual pvpers by pve-ers just wanting av rep/items.
---
[Look Alive!](https://youtu.be/tbFrhK3-hJs?t=44)
---
I think many of the mindsets I see in my guildies and others are that they have to push AV, because they have to rank. Most of them are doing other things while AFK playing the game. And if you're AFK playing, you're probably not super in to dueling.
---
Because I can cast bloodthirst while disarmed.
---
Sweet!
---
It depends on your price range tbh. I usually go for Lenovo but the yoga line can run upwards of $1k, which is a bit much just to run classic wow and league. Best Buy has a HP laptop that's $600 (SKU 6364574) that would run well and an Asus for $500 (SKU 6360986) that doesn't have a dedicated GPU if you want to save some money. You probably will just have to keep it on low settings if you want a decent framerate.  And on the low end I found another Asus for $400 (SKU 6297000) but that's a stretch IMO. You wouldn't be able to get 60fps on the lowest settings, probably around 30-40.
---
Cool. Did not know druids have Imps now.
---
I know, I just dont have the will to drop alch or hers to make that trinket and then relvl one of them.
---
Playing a hybrid PvPvE Disc Priest Healer for first time in classic, and the class *feels* powerful. There is no class I am afraid to fight 1v1, EVEN AS A HEALER. Mages? Dispell/Mana Burn/Shield ftw. Warlock? Shadow Resist/Dispell/Mana Burn ftw. Warrior (LOL)? Bubble and they cant generate rage ftw. Only tough class to fight is Rogues if they get the jump on you and you are not bubbled. 
---
My favourite parts of being a priest:
---
\-Best healer in the game
---
\-Bubble spam / survivability
---
\-Mind Control fun
---
\-Insane 1v1 PvP potential 
---
\-Best buffs in the game
---
\-DISPELL (one of the most useful skills in the game)
---
\-Highly sought after in both PvE and PvP
---
Theyre immune to the debuff
---
get one for like a few sessions, that's all it takes or small group classes.
---
So what special and unique class/race combo are you?
---
What pet should I use around lvl 20-35 as warlock? Atm my voidwalker feels crappy, should I get the succubus?
---
wait there is a process for the ally to follow to kill drek?
---
I know what I'm doing next raid.
---
With 15 min queues, you should more incentived to pvp, that time is more precious
---
Use life tap when you need to move. If you’re life tapping more than 3x in a row, you’re doing it wrong
---
I’d rather just farm lashers solo to make gold and pay for it tbh. Or Strat live farm. At that kill rate it’s not worth farming.
---
this keyboard layout is wackkk
---
Why did this need to be put on the internet?
---
Nothing in this pic or really in your commentary suggests an over reaction.
---
Absolutely a misunderstanding and unmet expectations.
---
You paint yourself as innocent but if I was in a group that I had started and someone joined, pulled people away from what we were currently doing, and then went somewhere I could t easily follow, then got everyone killed, and then proceeded to remove me from the group... I’d probably be a little peeved also.
---
Not sure I’d go from “0-100” but I’d definitely put ur ass on ignore.
---
To each their own, trading bloodthirst for shield slam and gaining flurry and enrage causing less threat doesn't seem to add up though.
---
There are very few of those fights in mc tbf
---
If back then you thought you'd get more gear if you went solo as 31 to stocks... That pretty much shows how horrendously bad you were at the game. There's a good chance your gear was white quality, or zero stamina or something similarly misguided. Since then you had some 15 years of gaming experience. You knew to get some correct items, which quests to hit for them and not to replace a lvl23 item that you deemed useful with one of the multitude greens you get while leveling. Yet you claim you are now somehow worse at the game.
---
Oh, and you never linked the vid of the old Stocks.
---
It's from wowbash.

I ran back after Belinda. That's my thing now
---
First off, if you're making the claim, you show evidence. Stop trying to shift burden of proof.
---
Secondly, I never claimed they would do anything. In fact, every time someone brings up this topic people make claims both ways, but never provide a lick of proof, so I was just hoping for something concrete, not another random opinion. I don't need to provide a link because I didn't claim anything.
---
Look up a guide on drain tank spec. You use succubus
---
It's so fucking annoying when you life tap into that situation and you get healed to full. Waste of food at that point.
---
Depends on loot threshold I assume
---
I think an average clearspeed between 1h30m and 2h, not having any wipes is decent enough to fall in that category. It's smooth, no wipes, no standing still for nothing, no overpulls. I like it anyway.

---
Also play the AH, might take some time to learn
---
thanks for the detailed info
---
Do you have a link to that list by chance? Or how to get to it?
---
A fury/prot in the same gear as a deep prot will take the same damage (assuming they are bother wielding a shield), but will produce significantly less threat. It completely negates the whole point of being fury prot, you are basically wasting (“misusing” would be more accurate) many of your talent points. Gimping yourself and your raid for no real reason.
---
uhhh
---
ty for the info
---
If they're drinking anyways, they can eat food.
---
They are shit anyways and the 8 piece is useless.  Much better dungeon blues out there.  Only reason to grab them is for some 30/0/21 PvP or for completion for completions sake.
---
I feel like that goes too far, but after suggesting tricking someone into suicide, I don't have much of a moral leg to stand on lol
---
If the reason you aren't using 2h Slam with OEB is threat related, going dual wield isn't going to help - it'll be worse in fact. DW has more incentive to use Heroic Strike (bonus threat) and Execute (higher threat per damage).
---
Just stick with OEB and throttle your damage manually because the only way you are going to do better is find a better tank that doesn't hinder you.
---
Can't out heal 3k frostbolts and 1.3k fibroblasts tho

Tweak until happy.  Sagar laptops have always been killer for the pricing.   It's been about 6 years since ordering from Xotic, but my experience with them was 6 out of 5 stars as well.   The laptop came with a sound issue, they not only replaced the laptop, they sent the new one with all the custom options before I even shipped the first one back.  That laptop is still running strong as my mobile gamer.

---
Thank you, this is really informative. I'll look towards the belt in diremaul. 
---
The slam threat is exactly as you say, I can spoke a burst of up to 5-6k at times (1.5 white, 2k yellow and a 1.5 slam and even higher burst if I throw a BT in) am having great success with it. Justamaging agro is difficult at times esp during exec
---
Yes. If good players aren't happy in their guild that's on them. We just offer another option and most we offer to take us up on it. Again, their choice.
---
Had a few say no thank you also. We don't push, we just offer to the right people for what we want to do.
---
Right? 
---
Go have fun being a tryhard, I'm reliving my childhood, dammit!
---
it's not gonna matter for you, you won't be raiding in a guild that will have this problem
---
Then imagine being dwarf priest. Cool af *and* best priest racial.
---
Yeah, lots of people say it'll go one way or the other, no-one provides any proof. Without proof, their claims are meaningless.
---
This is a good point too, thank you. Just as an example. My friend is dw, roughly same gear... He beats me on DMG but doesn't appear to have the threat issues I have
---
stop being a dick
---
Before nerfs the trash between twin Emps and C-Thun was brutal.
---
For some reason on my server the horde are significantly worse. Alliance are only like 20% of the server but have 4/5 of the top guilds. 
---
Pvpingthe
---
 horde is usually like mowing down NPCs and half the time I kill someone they instantly take Rez sickness
---
That’s fine, was just stating my opinion.
---
Orb of deception! Turns allies in to horde and horde in to allies.
---
Here’s some advice for your guild leader. Have your OT literally sit at the same threat amount as lowest dps during phase one maybe sunder 2-3 times during phase 2 be careful sunder to much and you eat the fireball. Ony lands in phase 3 glued to your OT.
---
Is there a trick to coming out of ice block when you’re AOE grinding and not getting destroyed the millisecond you’re out of it?  Like how do you cancel IB then have time to frost nova and blink/walk away?  With big pulls it seems like I’m immediately one shotted
---

Apologies on formatting. I really blew that one.
---
Malefic bracers if you don't need hit, Blackmist if you do.  Cenarion are much worse than both of those, all though Malefic are fairly rare BoEs, when they do show up they are typically ~25-50g on the AH.

Have your officers sit down and go over each and every piece of gear. We did this for AQ40 and Naxx. MC/BWL is alot easier to distribute and only a few key items in those dungeons you want to go to your MVP players that will stay around.   
---
Best of luck
---
Hit really isn't that hard to find, we have 4 hunter mains in my guild in basically full BiS and all of us use +7 dmg scope.
---
&gt; I do think it odd when I don't see the lock tapping when at low mana though....
---
I've had random healers told me that they won't heal me at all, if I life tap. Maybe that could be it.
---
I actually think Dwarves are the lamest race in WoW...
---
You must not be using gotw since it costs 1200 Mana and 4 casts for half the raid is 4800, which you should have more than.
---
One quest in the Linken Adventure (Un’Goro) chain requires you to interact with a ghost npc in Tanaris.
---
Yeah it was a free transfer so I only had a couple options

Calm down Satan.
---
Your evidence is based on capping a flag defended only by an afk noobie?
---
Ah, yeah, of course. But I wouldn’t bet on it generating much money before level 40.

Just a self-validation thread for OP to make him feel better about himself. Nothing to see here

Because they have 80 people actively raiding?

There’s dueling in TB next to the war masters.
---
F to pay respects
---
I would like official quest markers and map icons where to go instead of having to use questie.
---
your logic is sound.
---
If you want to make gold, take gathering proffessions.  
---
The reason to take a crafting prof is so that you can craft the gear, which imo is almost never worth it outside of engineering.
---
Go to Thunder Bluff for duels, you can literally duel right next to the battle-masters in Hunters Rise.
---
You can be summoned from the start of MC to Majordomo once you get inside the raid
---
I swear Twinsanity has some of the best OST of any games out there. So underrated imo
---
What's randomly rolled?
---
Do NOT spam AV with this shit.
---
You also need to add some lua script to delete all teleport runes (don't know the english word) except one.

Molten core, face pulling straight into the boss and get one shot. Especially if you do /castrandom with about 1/5 chance of it being blink and  4/5 for being frostbolt.
---
I am in our guilds alt raid and we killed rag without submerge for the first time last ID. We don‘t log and I thin you are right to assume, most dont.
---
No they are the exact same. Guy A can use it so instead of having to buy it from the AH for 500g you saved it, he got 500g of value. Guy B can't use it but sells it in the AH for 500g, he got 500g value. 500g = 500g. In your mind 500g &gt; 500g.
---
Would be better off joining the server discord and looking under the guild recruitment tab
---
Ah fair enough, what about the attack speed juju does that also not stack with juju might/power?
---
Better
---
in /1 : "/ragequit and /guildquit were sitting on a bridge, /ragequit fell off, who pushed him?"
---
Yeah. Healing aggro isn't huge, but it does apply to all mobs, so it's situationally handy. 
---
In one or two cases that have gone seriously sideways, I've even popped out of bear mid-fight to barkskin/tranquility. It's all the aggro forever. It'll also get ya killed if you mistime it, but hey. In case of emergency, break glass.
---
Yeah, both innervate and Hots are a godsend to tanking bears to keep downtime minimal.

Pass me the agony flavored one please.

My friend back in TBC had hes actionbars hidden and I made a macro on spacebar with Jump and a DC macro in the same. Everytime he jumped he got disconected and had no clue what was going on. He sent a ticket to blizzard asking why he disconect everytime he jumped.. If only the guy who posted this had hidden actionbars this is the way to troll people
---
&gt; Why is Renew Rank 6 (Lv38) the rank equivalent Heal Rank 2 (Lv22)? 
---
It's dependent on your heal power so I just put in the numbers for my example of +600 healing and at that level, they both heal for the same amount. Both skills, due to their coefficients, will heal for different amounts depending on how much +heal you have, talents, etc.
---
Got the trash drops and pants from rag but every other druid piece has gone to someone else. Not too worried though. My day will come
---
I’m pretty confident I could out-heal any above average similarly geared priest as a Druid in a long boss fight
---
How tedious is the WSG grind?
---
Oof. Leafs are going to alta in our guild that haven't hit 60 yet sometimes :(
---
if you're leveling you can just dark pact between pulls and never worry about mana in dungeons. if you're 60 you shouldn't be drain spec anyway, and you're wasting all your spellpower by casting spells with terrible scaling
---
I'm playing a troll enhancement shaman and I'm currently level 35. I've heard that some players switch to elemental around 37-40. I've always preferred elemental on my retail shaman but I've heard its not as good for leveling as enhancement. Would it be worth switching over to elemental pre-60? I intend on playing it end-game but I didn't know if the play-style really works before then. Also, is it different enough from enhancement at my level to justify respecing?
---
I just don't want to waste a cheap respec and either be stuck with something I dislike or have to spend more gold.
---
Where’s the marker for zerg Drek. That’s the one that matters.
---
Where do you do these turn-ins?  I know where the armor guy is, and the mines boxes, but that's it.

---
In my experience the voidwalker couldnt hold aggro for shit anyway so i just used succubus.
---
i used succ at 20 until about 40 then switched to fel because hes kind of the middle ground between tanky and damage
---
Evil will always win because good is stupid.
---
Rogues can solo angerforge and a Warrior can duo him with a healer by abusing the ledge. Emperor is much harder to kill.
---
I raid on grobb and it is not what everyone on reddit seems to talk about. It’s horribly horde dominated and all the ally sit in IF all day and rp. I honestly have been having more fun since bgs came out cause I can actually do something besides raid log. It’s some sort of meme of reddit to say grobb is the best server cause I don’t understand why people say it.
---
Oh lawlbringer; t5 is pretty ugly too but you got it beat.
---
Yeah that's where I get the FD resist the most. The double warlock pack right next to the ramp
---
The people that have been banned previously for using programs similar to this took advantage and re-sized objects (like mining nodes) and/or wall textures so as they could walk through, these actions are a clear action of abuse and gain a huge advantage over other people.
---
People who use iMorph don't have this facility and purely change their appearance which will reduce the threat of a ban.
---
That being said it is probably still a bannable offence so they use it at their own risk, however the likely hood of this happening is a lot slimmer.
---
We did it with 28
---
If they had fun and play games to have fun I'd say congratulations are in order as well. If the others play just to tryclown then that's on them. There's no need to feel sorry for the people taking games too seriously.
---
I afk'd my way from honored to exalted in AV. Not one time was I kicked for it.
---
Bro it's 1.12 the spawn time on demons is always 15 mins no matter if it's reset,killed or despawn
---
This is a public forum. Anything you say is open to others opinion. Doesn't matter what you personally think about it. This "i didnt ask for your opinion" comment is beyond stupid. Get over yourself lol.
---
ok druid
---
No one is "easily 20 manning" MC in greens and blues, lmao. 
---
Imagine being so salty that people expect others to put in 10% effort, to avoid having to spend 3+ hours every week in MC.
---
Dungeon maps would be nice.
---
YES! This 100%
---
Ha look at this OP, assuming we have friends
---
Amount of times Ive failed to convince groups to clear this pack / packs near by it for locked chests...
---
Because ele is all about burst compared to most other specs. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, it’s amazing, but compared to most other casters it’s very much more about bursting your opponent down rather than winning through attrition/making outplays with immunity and defensive skills/being super slippery or sticky. Ele shamans usually either kill you or die.
---
And where has that been all my life?
---
I only did the grind for a couple months on Classic on my Shaman. Stopped at Rank 10 because I changed games I think.
---
My last 2 weeks I got 4 mil and 4.3 mil.
---
People that have the time it can be insane lol.
---
I think I was on vacation and still single 😂
---
I used to duel outside org pretty often, but got bored of only ever fighting frost mages rogues and shadow priests. Warriors never want to duel a hunter because they think I’ll just pre trap them. Shamans should duel more often because they wreck. Warlocks are too busy boning corpses in the graveyard.
---
So many dies there. So many noobs.
---
Innervate for the times when they just aren't drinking fast enough
---
Real pros use Thunder Bluff as their Pvp hub.  You can duel right next to the Warmasters :D
---
Speak for yourself.  I think I played 30+ AV's yesterday and only lost 3-4.  In fact one loss we had Drek to under 5% health and almost beat the Horde.  Thank god for AV premades.  Pugging it just sucked balls after the first few days for Alliance.
---
To each their own I guess 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ on my server a couple of guilds have their members banned from thr main pug raids and generally shunned because of poaching
---
It’s different for the dm north trib chest. 
---
You can just zone into that dungeon and loot the chest

Prerequisite: must have IRL friends

No feeling of fulfillment for the ganker? That’s cool you get to decide what’s fulfilling for other people.

He wants it he can have it. It's not really a dick move.
---
As a proud member of the Firemaw premade, can you link the screenshots? :P  
---
And yes, we pretty much perfected our AV runs so we can win in 7-8minutes, or around 12 minutes vs. a turtle. :)
---
Yeah, we can usually get 28-34 people for Raid 2 and clear Rag without much difficulty. With the upcoming holiday, we were down to 21. That is pushing it a bit, especially when Raid 2 isn't very well geared.
---
Cause most of us weren't bullied as a kid.

---
&gt;  Is it always the same spot? 
---
No, it's no always the same spot, to the point where I started suspecting GM involvment in this. All my last kites (and that's about ten times) they despawned when the first dragon runninng was about to enter the bridge of the back entrance.
---
&gt; Is it possible it could be something like that? 
---
Probably not. I kited them great many times and issues started happening only recently.
---
&gt; Did it happen within 3 seconds of hitting them last? 
---
Yes, the despawns were brutal, although I do not keep such short timespans of attacks in general. The despawn happens after roughly 12 seconds without attacking it, so I simply kept using Distracting Shot rank 1 on an 8 sec CD and never had any issues. Kiting them for several minutes up to Ogr is no problem, but then they brutally disappear no matter what I do (and sometimes it happened just after I shot at them).
---
&gt; Whenever there were guards on them if the guard died and nothing else was attacking right after, they would despawn 
---
They despawned before getting to guards.
---
I managed to get them inside Org twice. The first time I made it to the bank and a raid guild waiting for Ony buff simply killed them. An other time, they despawned when the most advanced drake was aroung the FP the bank (the rest was in the Cleft, as I run through there).
---
It's worth mentionning the pack of three scatters in Org due to guards aggroing the ones I am not shooting at, which means I end up having one on my tail and the rest being out of LoS. That being said, the distance between them or being LoS does not affect wether they despawn or not - they keep despawning before Org's back entrance anyway.
---
2 Days 30% chance, 3 days 40% chance, 4 days 30% chance.
---
Additionally, the time he will respawn is selected at his death.
---
If the server restarts and he is not alive, this timer restarts and it will be based off of when the server officially restarts.
---
Ive seen a few popular streamers do this. I really hope they get banned. Not because i dont like them. But because i kinda love the drama that happens between their fans and people who hate streamers.
---
yes we are tryna have fast games doesnt really matter if we win or lose good honor either way
---
I deleted the drain spec at 60 part because I realized I'm kind of drainspec myself as the SM/ruin lock, haha. I tend to think of drainspec as dark pact spec.
---
And dark pact spam between pulls in dungeons is great while leveling, it's boring to spam but much faster than drinking and you can do it on the move - definitely better than lifetap + drain mid pull
---
Oh I found it. Yeah the tldr of the entire guide is vwis shit unless hard quest. thnx
---
Why would you ban someone for recruiting good players to help your guild? That's weird to me.
---
Like I said, we're never pushy, we just mention we've got spots open if they're unhappy where they are.
---
Looks like CT mod
---
Easy collusion
---
for only 20$ a meal
---
Wait are you trying to claim its 2.0 instead of 1.12 or what?
---
In Vanilla WoW Naxx broke a lot of guilds. Now understand that in Vanilla, if you were deep in Naxx then you were a pretty hardcore guild, we had been raiding 5 days a week since BWL so we were tight and competent.
---
My guild was one of those that completely fell apart, on the way we had several GM's burn out but in the end the whole guild burnt out and disbanded after an AQ farm run that just went to shit.
---
I believe those videos you see are staged for comic effect. No one acts like that.
---
I guess it's fine until you have nightfall and fire mages
---
Perfect!
---
You could just log and play another game. That is what I mostly do and just level an alt for a couple of hours per week.
---
The thing is, Horde is way stronger in PvP when it comes to racials.
---
Orcs can neutralize Fire mages, Shadow priests, Rogues, warriors and druids with the help of one passive talent.
---
Add to the fact Blood Fury tips the favor in 1v1 combat against any classes, since warriors have no self-heal to speak of anyway.
---
This is the reason why orcs are so overplayed atm, since they get an edge in both PvE and PvP.
---
Undead straight up counter Warlocks and Priests, since you can hardly get rid of them once they’re on you.
---
Tauren have more health than any class (and everyone knows how important health is in PvP).
---
And also an AoE stun, which is extremly strong.
---
Alliance does not meassure up to those racials.
---
Also human (like orc) is overplayed on the alliance, due to their PvE potential.
---
The strongest PvP racial we got is Escape Artist, and gnomes have it.
---
Second strongest is Dwarfs stoneskin.
---
Orc is pretty much the best race overall in Classic (stun resist in PvP, even useful in PvE, albeit situational).
---
(Axe specialization, the reason alliance goes human is for Sword/Mace specialization, orcs somehow can compete there).
---
(Blood Fury, 25% more melee damage, which is like having an extra Enrage that you can pop when you feel like it, amazing in both PvE and PvP).
---
(Command, 5% more damage on pets, not that great in raids, but free passive damage in PvP and dungeons).
---
There’s a reason almost every class on the Horde side that can be an orc is, because they are extremely strong.
---
You could slap Escape artist on Humans, and they would still be inferior in the PvP/PvE balancing when compared to orcs.
---
The reason Alliance can even hold a candle in PvP against Hordes is Holy Paladins.
---
Emphasis on Holy.
---
Because at the moment 70-80% of the Paladins i get queued with (in both AV and WSG) is Retribution.
---
Not only do they not heal, but they never use their utility on anyone but themself.
---
Ret palas are amazing in a 1v1 fight, but in group/raid fights they can’t keep the pressure on much.
---
I’m sure the Horde faces similiar problems with Enhancement shamans, that watched one to many old school PvP videos, and think Enhancement can reck everything in their path.
---
But atleast shamans have two specs that work in PvP (Resto or Ele).
---
Ele might have some issues, since they’ll go OOM as fast as a Spriest, and they need their CD’s to be properly functional, but atleast ele can delete people in PvP, and put on more pressure than a ret pala.
---
Prot Paladins are very niché, and amounts to nothing more than a budget Druid as flag carrier in WSG.
---
So when you PuG a WSG or AV (although AV have different issues, but we’re not gonna discuss it here).
---
Paladins will be quite rare (1-5 in AV) and (0-1 in WSG), and there’s like a 70% chance that the Paladin in question will be Retribution.
---
So Alliance get no, or hardly no edge there.
---
Whereas the Horde will simply get an edge due to being orcs/tauren/Undead.
---
Also each Ele shaman is a more lethal force than every Ret pala.
---
Hordes simply have an edge until alliance starts bringing Holy palas into the equation.
---
ive literally never had a healer tell me this. what kind of people are u playing with
---
I got 5 pieces our first MC!
---
On my server. Raid tank spot would be very hard to get. But as a tank for end game dungeons?  You would have people begging you.
---
By sticking together on the rush to Galvangar and then getting to their base asap.
---
Alliance in AV became laughable- people rush Galvangar where 5-10 people defend. Instead of killing them you guys start running around like headless chickens and that small group wipes a raid of 20-25 people easily.
---
What happens next is even worse- Alliance completely falls apart. Horde usualy kill Balinda during that time and you guys just give up, some are random fighting Horde at SH and some are running back to the base to defend while select few try to get further south but Horde is waiting for them at IB for easy honor kills.
---
i love reading misinformation spreaded as facts
---
Switch loot seeds.
---
We are on 12 accurias and 6 perds
---
I didnt say target caller. I said shot caller. Shotcaller's job isnt "kill this guy". Its who gets the flag? Who stays with fc and goes for efc? Do we abndon this fight? How long on res timer? Ok group up. We need more on D or offense?
---
They have the most info with humanoid tracking, they call the plays.
---
My guild didn't use FR for Vael. No one knew how to do good DPS, though, so we usually went through 3-4 tanks. The blocker was never DPS, though (beyond the obvious "the faster you kill him the less likely people will make mistakes").
---
8pm server time, which is east coast.  We raid monday/tuesday with 12 days off between to save on respec costs. The players are fairly extreme, everyone is expected to come with full consumables and highly encouraged to get world buffs as well. Super fun to compete for logs tho!
---
LW will not be very profitable, so unless you are planning to be your guild's leatherworker, I would suggest something like herb/mining. There are macros and addons that make it easier to switch between the two trackings, and I've heard that rogues can have a lot of success stealth mining silithus hives.
---
Those are immolate and siphon life flavor!
---
I stopped using greater a long time ago, but I'm a resto shaman with FR totem.
---
i think its fine tbh. This is what it was like with elvui   https://imgur.com/VE72Lkf
---
Thanks for the update on your personal life, OP. Very classic-related post.
---
same here, im still rocking the green 2% hit shoulder with 9 epic pieces, t1 shoulders has only dropped once for our guild and i just cant force myself to do more UBRS
---
Dont worry bro i'm there with you even though people are downvoting. Very rarely can you justify muggers belt. You can dps spreadsheet it and quickly realize this.
---
Thanks for the answer! Is frost resistance good for rogues? Or is it only for tanks?
---
Your healers are either bad or lazy. Locks need to life tap so I can pad the healing meters!
---
Message Plagueiss or Penguin when you get on if you're interested in joining mercenary raid 2, starts at 9:40 server time on Thursdays, still partial pug but working on filling it up.
---
Weird, since I don't have CTmod :/

But not the print screen? Lol jkjk looks good!

can check on warcraftlogs
---
ok atleast we arent alone in wondering about this then, guess waiting is all we can do, thx for your input!
---
Lookin' clean my dude
---
Know an Asian multiboxer on my server, he said he makes roughly 100USD a day leveling accounts and selling gold.
---
This is a country that has and median wage of like 5000 USD a year...
---
I carry like 15 greater to MC and pop them like candy when I'm confident I won't need a major.  Superior just doesn't make sense price wise on my server.  I just mail my raid consumables to an alt, then back to my main, so they don't take up space when I'm not raiding.  Grab when I need.
---
Shadowpanther doesnt account for all the item combinations/sets. it is better to use spreadsheet like bloodmoons to see real dps difference for specific combinations of gear.
---
Thanks for the information! I would use alchemy only for personal use (crafting potions and flasks for myself) and i would farming low level dungeons (like RFD) to disenchant the items. So actually i only want get gold from enchanting.
---
Tried hovering over and the only thing I got up was "Clock" no idea what that tells me :/
---
If you really want to cause havoc: change 'portal stormwind' to 'teleport darnassus'
---
Username doesn’t checks out
---
Strange. I used to have that thing there too. But i dont anymore. not sure why tbh. have changed addons so many times.
---
Yup
---
SS has higher base threat in current gear. Eventually (maybe late BWL or sometimes in AQ), you have enough base stats from gear that BT will pull ahead without requiring world buffs to do so.
---
Fury/prot is stronger than deep prot currently IF you have full consumes and world buffs, because it scales better with stats. The haste from WCB and all the crit and AP you gain from DM/Ony/SFS scale really well with BT compared to SS.
---
This has been talked over in Fight Club a ton, and the general consensus is that Fury/prot is only worth it you are going all out on buffs. If you die at any point on the run, you’re value as a tank just went to shit and you might as well be the OT for the rest of the run.
---
Of course this also depends if your guild is pulling the numbers to warrant it. If not, you’re safe threat-wise to go fury/prot, but you’re also causing more strain on healers since you take more damage (due to lack of shield) and the fights lasting longer. If you wear a shield a lot, you’re wasting points. You gain significant amount ms of rage gen to feed into threat skills with your OH weapon, which is now gone due to shield. Flurry would even out rage gen, but because it’s only buffing one weapon and not two, you aren’t gaining as much value from it.
---
Switching around 40 is a great idea. Not only can you kill just as quickly (if not quicker) but the gear you'll be using also allows you to heal dungeons perfectly well enough without switching specs or keeping two sets of gear.
---
Thanks for the information! No, i won't be the raid's supplier. I plan to running low level dungeons (like RFD) and disenchanting the items (i heard the shards are more worth than the items).
---
Shadowpanther will give a good reference point but for PVE raiding I would use dps spreadsheets because it will account for specific item combinations/sets. You can find in rogue discord that is what most people use.
---
Just wait for the drop bro especially if you get it next that takes a while to farm that gold
---
We haven't got him yet amd i don't know why tbh. Most people are pre bis or better. We alway go into 2nd phase and can even kill all the mobs. Tanks do a good job switchimg when ome gets knocked up, me (priest) and onother healer do fi e healing the tank but eventually we go oom. I guess we have a little dps problem which has nothing to do with gear.
---
Very. You only get rep from flag caps (you don't have to be the capper) and from marks of honor.
---
Losing 0-3 gets you 1/3 of a MoH turn-in (33.3 rep). Nothing more.
---
Nobody does it to tell themselves they're good. They do it because it's fun for them
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Premade vs pug in a nutshell
---
I had 250,000 honor last week. This week I have 443. Some people just do it solely for the ring.
---
The correct answer is communicate with your healer. Just be like "hey I'm going to live tap a bit so we can keep going?"
---
If they say yeah it's cool respond with "thanks let me know if it becomes a problem."

The number of times I get snowballed by the alliance is tiny compared to the number of times some asshole on my own team does it.

The fact pugs/guilds still wipe on Ony is basically proof that BWL is going to be a barrier for more players than not.   The separation of the haves and have nots begins soon haha.

Black Lotus has a chance to fail up til 325 skill and it has been theorized the higher your skill the lower chance of fail you have. I keep a pair of herbalist gloves with the herbalism enchant with me when I go out herbing in case I find a lotus. It's yet to be beneficial but in theory could prevent you from failing and having one nabbed/let you swipe one somebody else fails to pick.

its obviously a 50% rate. it either drops or it doesnt

They can detect it and have banned for it on retail. No reason they wouldn't on classic, though I'd presume low priority. Who knows
---
As an alliance premade player, I'll give you a big tip. Convince most people to defend your keep and that will break down most premade games off the bat. I'm talking like 25+ people. If the alliance can't cap FWGY and FWRH it's a done deal

Very much like our raid. We’ve only had one resto Druid since we started raiding and he’s got his 8 piece already. Now we just end up DE all the Druid gear until we find a 2nd Druid to dump all the gear to.
---
Meh, even if I put truck nuts on my ride is still call it a her.   But you might be right, it's been a long time.

Hahahahahaha of course he says they need 80. Always have to outnumber alliance to even stand a chance.
---
Double \[Enter\] creates a new paragraph on reddit
---
&gt;in the mean time I'd like to push some respectable dps.
---
That's going to entirely depend on what you consider respectable. Do you want orange parses? You're gonna want them edgies or aclg w/daggers and there's not much other way around it. Do you just want your guild leader to be satisfied that bosses are dying? You can probably get away with not having them, but you're still going to want them because even just the 5 weapon skill will be worth around 100 dps *and* frees up 3% hit from your other gear.

Logging is fairly easy and can reveal everything people do wrong. Not necessary to flame people, but rather seeing what can be improved. If rag submerges elementals should be grouped and slowed by hunters, mages etc and kited to make thing easy and melee should try not to get auto'd to death during frost novas. Warlock banishes is also a good bonus to prolong the phase, first aid up etc before he re emerges. Also Fire protection/Greater fire protection potions are rly helpful, if people pop 1 before the fight and 1 before elemental phase you will save alot of mana.
---
They have never banned someone for tmorph unless you openly say you are using it. 
---
They can not detect it. That’s the whole point of this thread.
---
It's not so much that as a response to queue times.  On BG Tuesday and the next day, our queue times were four minutes.  Waiting four minutes to lose 8-9 minutes and still get great honor was worth it.  However, once the queue times broke into double digits, the thought of spending 2/3 of the time waiting for the queue to drop was too much to take.
---
&gt;  The disenchant loot table is rolled when the item pops into existence.
---
Source? I keep hearing that rumor, but can't find a single blue post supporting it.
---
I have no idea. I assume it is a bug because I can't think of why they'd intentionally change it, but who knows.
---
Logs? I’m always looking for data on unbuffed dps
---
You can hit cap without it. Would need the ony neck to drop surefooted, but probably won't have to wait too long by the sound of your guild.
---
I am a druid whose goal in WoW is to get a full t1 set. I have raided MC I think 12 times.
---
I have the helm.
---
I've seen 5 more pieces drop in all my runs.
---
Screw you OP. Screw you as much as screw RNGesus
---
So happy to help!
---
Alliance can premade, horde can't. 
---
Alliance can solo pull Drek, horde can't solo pull Vann
---
Alliance can run straight through the horde base without aggroing any unnecessary NPCs, horde cant.
---
Face it, the deck is stacked and you just have to accept that any win is against all odds. The only advantage horde has is Belinda being easier than Galv.
---

---
I also find it pathetic whenever alliance say "just put people on defense" ... while never needing to send anyone on defense themselves.
---
I am pretty sure you are completely wrong about that.
---
Could be a WeakAura set up, did you import a group string? Try checking
---
I'm one of 4 druids in my raid and the only tank. I still have 5/8 T1 and 1/2 T2. We have been farming MC/Ony since the first of October.
---
I'm still using thrash blade...
---
Fixed, thanks
---
Low prio means it can't override those and will immediately be overriden. Even if bosses weren't immune to it, it'd get pushed off instantly.
---
Pretty typical to use Innervate for a priest or pally.  Not to be offensive, but their ability to continue healing is more important than a druids since they are typically on tank duty.
---
For those that don’t know bosses in molten core have only 1 loot table for horde and alliance. When pally gear drops for horde (shaman gear for alliance) the sever automatically swaps it for Druid gear.
---
Nuts, wrong sub:p

Is that a pro Genji?
---
as an aliance player solo queing. i find myself loosing 70-80 % of the time in av

Apologies, initially I captured the wrong bar but obviously I uploaded the original and not the correct one.

If I bind a number (5 in the case of this test) to the same button that I have Regrowth also bound to E... it works when I use the number and fails when I use E. :s
---
I am starting to suspect its a rumor started by people who want everyone else to DE purples so they can sell their nexus crystals for more.
---
When you don't involve other players then yes. If there's no people ganking common power grinding spots then they're the fastest way to level. Consider how much effort it takes to travel from zone to zone, town to town to find a few quests that may or may not give a decent XP return. 
---
Typically I personally combine this sort of grinding with doing super easy quests that are on the way to these spots anyway. If I'm killing a few hundred yetis in winter spring and there's a quest to collect some feathers outside or kill some bears or something and it's only a few feet away, I'll do the quest quickly to avoid the monotony.
---
But grinding has been found to be the quickest way to level to 60 in classic wow, usually with a mage or hunter generally but the purpose of my videos is to show spots that should work for any class for each faction.
---
There is a raptor from ZG
---
People forget that hearthstone share the cooldown with demonic and dark runes. But its certainly worth it to bring a couple demonic runes for tank and spank fights or parses.
---
Our healers were asking our locks to life tap at the end of the Lucifron fight last week for this exact reason.
---
Classic WoW is a G R I N D. Takes me hours for just a single level whereas I can get 4-5 levels in that same amount of playtime in retail.
---
Provided I don’t eat, sleep, or use the bathroom, I can hit 60 in a month. /sarcasm
---
Druid prank: Replace all their cat form attacks with the same icon, but it just /says "MEOW" instead
---
During a BWL we were running, one of our shaman healers decided to leave during the middle of the Suppression room to go to a doctor appointment. Turns out, he never actually left the raid and he got his sister who had never played WoW before to play while he was gone. We made it all the way through suppression when she accidentally facepulled broodlord and wiped us completely. This was already have a couple hours of progression and would have been our last pull with any kind of flask buffs. Needless to say.. People were upset. Video here: https://youtu.be/rpoRGDD-ydc

You can add a modifier.  
---
/use [mod:shift,@target,help,nodead][@mouseover,help,nodead][@target,help,nodead][@player] Heal

If you hold Shift while pressing the keybind for Heal, you'll cast Heal on your friendly and alive target instead of casting it on your mouseover.
---
I don’t care lol
---
Fishing in AV weirdly reveals the truth about people and their race. All trolls pass me by, /wave and sometimes fish next to me. Undead females more often than not also do that.   
---
Orc warriors and rogues will always gank me.
---
Undead rogues will ALWAYS attempt to gank me, then camp for a very long time.
---
Undead mages will always try really hard to 1v1 me and lose virtually always.
---
Then why’d you reply? Lmao, c’mon bud
---
Same problem on both sides.
---
“We’re winning!” = Game is fine.
---
“We’re losing!” = Game is unfair and imbalanced.
---
To quote Captain Picard: It’s possible to do everything right and still lose. That’s not weakness. That’s life.
---
The difference is that one advantage was temporary &amp; not coded into the game, the other is a permanent design flaw.
---
All of them were 60 and one was from a "respectable" guild. GM basically told me to eat shit. 250g roll. I'm just not rolling with anyone outside my guild period.
---
Thanks. I appreciate OP's enthusiasm, but this post is so long that people are going to ignore it.

Yeah, he should play a relaxing game like League of Legends instead.
---
Why is MT always nipple

You obviously are not a raid leader.
---
Check loot atlas for which loot you need from which dungeon and run the ones u need multiple pieces of multiple times if necessary.
---
You are not super gear dependent as a mage leveling so i wouldn’t worry too much apart from your wand. If I remember right you should get the best possible wand from the quest chain with the raptors in wetlands and that should sort u till the ones from the mage questline in dusk marsh’s
---
On my 32 warrior. Suddenly a 60 mage and 36 priest walks up to me. I ignore them. The 36 priest starts attacking me and the mage just decides to watch while his buddy is toying with me.

Well i wasn't just gonna roll over and die. At least swing back a bit.

You should mention the entire premade went afk the second they wiped at drek.

Tbh win or lose im getting decent honor, winning is the cherry ontop. The only time av is frustrating is:
---
A: be horde, wait 18 mins, join a match where 2.9k bonus honor has already been made so now you have to leave and wait 15 min leaver debuff to wait 20 mins again to finally get into (hopefully to join a fresh match)
---
B: "lets summon icyboi", if anyone even mentions it I just leave because I know ill be in there for atleast an hour because billy really wanted to summon a useless oversized elemental for "fun".

I wish I could give this an upvote for every extra hit proc

That's brilliant! Gotta try this
---
Whether a guild bring memespecs to raids or not simply depends on what goal the guild has. If they are speedrunning, bringing ret with them is obviously not the brightest idea. But if a guild just wants to clear content, bringing several memespecs is completely fine. I myself prefer to clear content as fast as possible so I have more time for PvP or farming, so while I think it's completely fine to have a couple of memespecs in the raid, I'd never want more than a handful of them because it would drastically increase clear times and leave me with less time to play the game.
---
Minor speed boots enchants.
---
Omg sorry for liking this combo! If you send me your address I will definitely make sure to personally address an apology letter to you because you don’t find this combo fitting. 
---
Im aware of the lack of racial, but still decided on this because, FLASHNEWS, PEOPLE LIKE DIFFERENT STUFF
---
I come from the land of "Ope, sorry."
---
My guild clears mc under an hour. Only ony takes over 2 minutes (we do split ony runs mind you).
---
I agree unless you're trying to push time, or if you're in a group that's still in progression they aren't needed. But the same could be said of any other consumables really.
---
Enchant your boots with minor speed enchant
---
It makes a difference.
---
Leave this guild now before you regret it. They're not gonna get anywhere in BWL+
---
That's only true for raiding. Pvp is the opposite.
---
There is no effecient farm anymore. Outside of premades of course.
---
Believe it or not, horde didn't like losing in sub 10 minute games so evolved their tactic.
---
As a rogue main this is my strat for pure gold. Level a druid to 35, give it herb and alchemy. Farm swiftthistle and stranglekelp, never leaving the barrens. Max out alchemy for now and sit on it or farm those 2 herbs when you're bored. Get a second account, use your rogue to power level a mage through dungeons till you stop getting XP in SM. Hopefully you should be level 44 or higher. Use the gold you've made on the druid to buy the best "of the eagle" gear you can for the mage  Spend the next week learning how to gold farm zombies in ZF. You'll rage for awhile but eventually get it down. Use the money you make on the mage to buy recipes and cheapest herbs you can get for the druid and start selling consumes. Get a rotation of crafting consumes and farming ZF. If you get bored finish leveling the mage and get it's epic mount to make farming easier. Or finish leveling the druid to farm herbs. Never do pick pocket runs again. Always have gold. Always have raid consumes. Always have a good dungeon tank, raid heals (maybe) and good raid dps. This route is best optimized as horde for tauten herb racial buts probably fine on alliance also.
---
I'd like to see summoning stones
---
In my group we have a lot of melee and people use what they can get. There just hasn't been that many weapons dropping for us yet. Fingers crossed that will change soon.
---
Your guild would have to be an actual potato to give ring of spell power to a ret over a mage
---
Damn that’s whack. Sorry man. 
---
Also my comment sounded snotty, didn’t mean it to be - was just trying to help ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
So glad I ground this out I’m the first 2 days. AV seems like a shit show now
---
In early vanilla nefarian gate would close when you wiped and if you didn't have a soulstone you would have to wait til next reset to attempt him again
---
That ritterol is having very strange effect on the way you think.
---
Jesus you are an insufferable asshole. I feel bad for whoever is in your guild/whoever is your real life friends (you probably don’t have any)
---
Warcraft logs will show everything if your guild takes loga after every raid.
---
I babysitted my siblings and they were finally asleep, huh excuse me! 
---
It most be a pleasure to have dinner with you man. Love just surrounds you too!
---
I mean using what you can get is one thing, but earthshaker is worse than thrash + mirah's song. If you want to raid as 2H and not be a meme, get OEB or BRE first, and even then since the topic is ret paladins, you're ally and will still be a bit memeish outside of cleave fights.

This
---
It gets you one free GCD over the duration of a bossfight. You can cast one extra shadowbolt a bit over halfway.
---
It makes such a huge difference for healers but for locks its close to nothing.
---
I know that, it's the same as Vael it doesn't make it more difficult at all, it's just the reason why top guilds took so long to down him, because of the limited attempts.
---
Also now raids are much more organized with soulstones my guild never actually had to corpse walk in MC so it wouldn't matter we can rotate soulstones very easily.
---
Also I'm pretty sure this limitation was removed before or right after the world first it was just to slow down top guilds progression but didn't affect average guilds in any way
---
No worries man. Stupid deathrolling has left a bad taste in my mouth. My guild got me into it and it was fun. Looked for that fun outside the guild and got burned. No one's fault but my own. I'm only so salty about it due to the main guy who burned me. I epicly lost a 250g roll to him the week before with a 2500, 1111, 1 and I paid up.
---
Thanks!
---
I probably use it more for that than I do for mid pull saves.
---
As long as the healer has mana, I'm pulling. Innervate and a third of a bar counts as mana.
---
Fell asleep mid snack hihihi
---
If you have even half of your pre-bis you should be able to do rotgrip easily as a warlock
---
Even if the mage is nearly never online, fails at the already limited mechanics that are present and struggles to beat the same ret pally in the meters?
---
I suppose a lot of groups would just cut the mage and pick up something else but that's a different matter.
---
Not blue, purple
---
I would stay Arms and PvP in AV until you get Don Julios at 60.  Then switch specs if you still want to.
---
Sure, but Blizzard is never going to fix ANYTHING in this game. Except exploits. So being realistic...

wtf did i just watch. 
---
wtf to people make videos of.

As alliance player horde does need more offence most games
---
Hey, I've made the main points **in bold** just for you. A carefully crafted targeted post. Just submit a in-game bug about the *Plain Letter* being soulbound, it's a matter of 30 seconds. Thank you.
---
Maybe for trash but keep that up and you wouldn't be in my raids
---
Your only utility is to wear Nightfall and keep judgement up. You're not here to DPS, as your damage output is garbage compared to other classes'. Yet... There's no problem with you getting gear over actual DPS classes, and if we call you out on your low damage, then we're toxic. 
---
I'm sorry but this reeks of entitlement.
---
Take a moment and think about giving a ret a ring of spell power over a mage, a warlock, a boomkin or even a shadow priest. Tell me with a straight face that you aren't talking out your ass and genuinely think that's beneficial. That might be the most absurd thing I've read today.
---
Holy moving the goalposts batman
---
How do u make so much gold?
---
I tanked Onxyia as a warlock for phase 3 last week. Was not intentional haha
---
There were quite a few short posts and they were successfully ignored, so I have decided to give it a try with a long one. Have you submitted a in-game bug though? It's a matter of 30 seconds. Just copy the pink text from the post. Thank you.
---
Oh, definitely they're all used. 
---
Cat gear is basically leather/fury warrior stuff. Agil, crit, hit, all that good stuff. 
---
Caster dps is largely spellpower, and may be at least partially cloth. 
---
PvE vs PvP changes some gearsets, too. PvP caster set tends to prioritize leather and sta higher than PvE does.
---
Yes you have 😂
---
Seconded
---
You're alliance. Find a premade.
---
I've done this in the sw moonwell, thing is deadly.

I JUST posted this in another thread lol. "As a rogue main this is my strat for pure gold. Level a druid to 35, give it herb and alchemy.

People who join conversations just to tell off others for their behavior really are oblivious assholes, aren't they? I bet they all deserve each other.
---
eleven1one fucking killed me haha
---
Druid tanks are very raid viable. It does require gearing specifically for it, though.
---
What's wrong with a 2-3 minute queue?
---
Getting 3k honor and either a win or loss in 15 minutes is better than a 45 minute game for the same amount of honor/rep
---
It's really not bad coming from osrs.
---
My sentiments exactly,  iv been playing at what osrs would consider casual and am nearly 60 with less than 8 days played
---
this dosnt let me queue up cleave
---
Yeah I dunno why I'm getting downvoted. I'm parsing 99 so I can sleep just fine.
---
1.3mil was top spot on Horde side on a full server too. Just because we have queues doesn't mean the top rankers are afk. We just need to find creative ways to get an edge
---
I am but I'll likely quit after getting it, burned out completely like everyone else from the AV grind.
---
Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behavior.
---
This also includes any other activity that goes against Blizzard's Terms of Use or License Agreement.
---
Do /castrandom with his totems, like all fire totems in one macro, all water in another and so on
---
Yeah good point, if there’s a mage there I’ll politely ask for some wawa.
---
Please upvote this comment for the TL;DR version. 
---
A *Plain Letter* item has become soulbound in Classic only. This seems to be a bug. Copy `pink text` from the post and submit an in-game bug report. It may take you 30 seconds max. Thank you.

I ran UBRS 50+ times and got Dal Rend's before I even got the TS shoulders.  Only saw them drop a couple times but lost the rolls.  I got my NS shoulders out of MC before even getting them.
---
This sounds like, you can't estimate the range on frostnova and leeway mechanics, for Zul Farrak you need around 6800 mana minimum+mana ruby. Also you should know when to reset and how to pull properly. Best to start with is to do 1 row and block them together then frostnova run to side and get a good spot from where to blizzard. Camera Management in Zul Farrak is also a big thing of aoe grinding. Most of my early death there were due camera fucked me up.
---
Real talk: Most raids probably are going to bring at least some folks in pre-raid gear, and an assortment of people in various stages. Gearing definitely helps, but you can absolutely down bosses in BWL without being covered in MC/Ony loot. 
---
The biggest thing is the tank. Tank's gear can't be complete crap. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it needs to be semi-good. You got that, okayish gear all round, and decent teamwork, you're fine.
---
Then give it to one of the other 5+ mages your raid definitely has. What kind of argument is that.
---

If this is your idea of a conversation, then yeah I am not surprised you have no friends IRL
---
Rofo is intrinsically superior to wawa
---
Its happening on my server Fairbanks also. I spam ORG chat to come outside to duel and only people that come are from my guild lol. Everyone is outside AV. Its not a big deal for now since I use a lot of pots from the vender there so its a win win
---
Dang you got shitty warriors
---
Winterspring tiger
---
it's even crazier but honestly it seems most the melee dps don't even have to leave. I believe it's a bug although it might have been fixed but our guild figured out only 2 rogues need to leave and they're not me so I just sit there hitting RAG full duration. Easy parse for me lol
---
Prioritize anything that gives you more armor:
---
Keep an eye out for people selling Unyielding Maul from their tribute runs
---
You might be able to pick up an Ardent Custodian on the cheap.  I paired mine with Stitches Femur until I got my maul.
---
Do the Darrowshire questline for the armor ring
---
Do the turtle escort in Tanaris for a green armor ring
---
Look for cheap blue leather on auction.  Especially Shadowcraft.  Even a piece or two of wildheart is okay if it replaces a particularly bad green piece.
---
Buy or craft devilsaur when you can.  Same with wolfshead helm, it's not great for stats but being able to powershift for 20 rage on command is handy.
---
Unless your guild uses any sort of addon to check for it and you end up with no loot priority because you're too lazy to bring consumables.
---
Wtf?
---
Definitely, even that GCD time is awesome to pump some more numbers but its definitely not necessary. Especially if you're bringing other proper consumes.
---
that would be quite the macro! My mouse wheel isn't reliable and I've been meaning to look for a new mouse, so I wouldn't have thought of that!
---
No, most will be account sharing AFKing through much of it. Most efficient way has for a long time now been to have a guild make constant premades for someone who just runs in and is “there”, usually with someone else logging their account in when they go to sleep.
---
It’s a ridiculous system.
---
Most of the unguilded players I see are bots. Obvious indications are:
---
- attacking my pet and not me
---
- turning to face the next mob and walking directly at it
---
- walking in a random direction until they get near a mob, then pathing directly to it
---
- pets with that single Chinese character that looks like the Horde symbol which I assume just says "cat"
---
- when they skin and something is interrupting them, they'll keep trying to cast skinning repeatedly until death
---
I have heard it is better to have a slow OH because it doesn't use of flurry procs you are wanting on your MH yellow hits... I am using QS and Alocar's Sunrazor and it works well - both fast. Nightelf with edgemasters &amp; Lionsheart.  Pretty much just stack crit/agi/stam once you have 6% (9%) hit.
---
Wotlk but we skip ToC all together. ToC and Blackwing descent are by far the worst raids they ever made.
---
Tbf alot of our guild has not been around this month I imagine raid logs from a more optimal night would reflect better, if my memory serves the entire guild was distracted by discord gambling on that raid lol.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10716/gnomish-shrink-ray
---
#2. The amount of effort put in allows them to do slightly higher dps than a shitty warrior in prebis. It really isnt that efficient to grant them gear priority. 
---
If you plan to raid strictly as ret you should be expecting to be last in line for that sweet loot.
---
I'm not sure if that's any more entitled than someone saying I do the most dps by default so I get all the benefits.
---
If there is a progression issue I understand using loot council and sitting people based on actual results but why can't we all be equal if that's not a problem? Or base our decisions on all the results and not just a select few?
---
This is an old post, but no. It literally happens maybe 85% of the times, no matter how I pull with my pet. Just gonna clarify that. I've tried messing with literally everything regarding how to pull ,and nothing solves it. Gonna try removing my 5 set piece to see if it changes.
---
This is the classic wow forum. Go play your dead tbc server elsewhere.
---
That's one way to make MC interesting.
---
My point was that a hunter spamming rk1 wingclip will have a significant reduction in their dps compared to a ret pally who can have equal or better uptime
---
If hes a raid and is expected to windfury
---
 #showtooltip windfury totem
---
/use windwall totem
---
You could also swap all his shocks.
---
I always tell people we just made an investment in them when we have a new member wipe the raid
---
Not particularly clever but enlisting a friend to guildmate to help you complete notable quests at the minimum possible level, ex: Bring the Light / Bring the End, The Grand Betrayal / Rig Wars, Corruption of Earth and Seed, etc. These can get you strong pieces of gears levels ahead of when you'd normally receive them.
---
Also, spend some gold to level Engineering, the helms, trinkets, and bombs don't generally have a level requirement so you can use most of them by 35.
---
I'd have to agree with this. If a Paladino got the sp ring over any caster in our raid force I'd question that decision.
---
I've always wondered... if you're a gnome and you decide to look like a tauren, does your leeway range increase?
---
Sounds like my guild. Tons of mage blades/staffs of dominance. 0 deathbringers, 1 vis'kag, 1 bre , I think only one perd (maybe 2), and I'm unsure on if we got a spinal or not. We are almost to the point of having more melee weapons from world bosses...
---
Would you happen to have the macro available? Those two links below are confusing.
---
This guy did a math...
---
He should get updoots.
---
what do you expect? Everyone is following leveling/gearing guides created from optimized data from 15 years of private server experience. We are all pros now.
---
If you're in a premade and win basically all the time, which is easy with a premade (only possible on alliance) it takes only 10-15 hours to go from neutral to exalted. Most turbonerds on alliance was exalted with stormpike on day 1. If you play with friends/guild it's easily doable within a weekend if you just zerg Drek.
---
Went yesterday killing Ragnaros as a pick up in a guild based raid... I thought I'd be underbuffed, not having a single potion to buff my rf...
---
Everything went well... 
---
For fire resistance, an old trick old gamers knew 15 years ago, that may still be a thing:
---
Bring a priest in the entrance of UBRS, kill soldiers but MC the mob who can give fire resistance buff (spell), and buff all your comrades...
---
You're welcome
---
I've read you need to kill hydrospawn and zevrim to unlock talking to the tree dude. What's the real story here?
---
Like I said, if you want to play meme specs, you should put up with the mindset that you get the gear to at least support that meme spec first. With your example, if you want to be a dagger rogue but don't have good daggers while having good swords, you'd be dumb not to go with the swords until you got daggers.
---
It's also a matter of social dynamics as people in the tryhard group can often feel frustrated if they do all this extra crap to make the raid go smoother and one of the "freeloaders" ends up getting the drop they really wanted over them. If your loot system somehow rewards people for tryharding (and the casuals are fine with that) or everyone just gets along really well it might not be an issue, but if not there's a chance either the hardcore players end up leaving to greener pastures or the casuals  get replaced by more active recruits down the road. Kind of struggling with this in our own guild right now.
---
The raptor and tiger mounts from ZG, the Baron mount from UD Strat, as well as the Frostsaber mount from Winterspring (Alliance only). Opener of AQ gets a mount (and anyone else that hits the gong within x hours?).
---
Don't know if you'd count these but there are Yellow, Blue, and Green bug mounts that can only be used inside AQ.
---
Technically, as long as the boss dies, it doesn't matter if you used 1000g in consumes or 0.  Dead is dead.  There are considerations based on time, money spent, and repair costs, sure.  But if a guild can clear content without any consumes and minimal side effects, why spend thousands of gold per run?
---
How does that work for rogues? It it just "manaless" tank? so sometimes instead of a tank its a rogue that dies?
---
Noob question, but how do you deal with a hunter unless you get the pet first? It's hard to cast when Broken Tooth is gnawing on your arm, and a skilled hunter outranges my spellcasting anyway.
---
I usually try to sheep the pet and hope they are Marksmen spec.
---
Irony is a dead scene, amirite?
---
Problem is, nobody ever marks because the group leader is never aware that he's the group leader.
---
For a Warrior (which these vids are usually made with) there's a ton of stuff I don't go into detail about because it's meant to be overall basic info. 
---
For a warrior I'd recommend jumping into a dungeon every 10 or so levels and grind that out until you've got some gear. 
---
Quests I pick up if necessary like class quests, quests on the way to my grind spots or dungeon quests. If they're easy I certainly do them, I don't totally ignore them. 
---
I'm starting to mention quests more in these videos because they're certainly valuable to do, they're just infrequent (as alliance anyway).
---
 As Horde I noticed it's much easier to find quests without many gaps though and most of my testing is usually on alliance side since that's my main's side. 
---
On alliance you can finish 8 quests in a town and that's it for the whole zone. At some level ranges that's literally it, unless you want to travel to remote parts of Kalimdor crowded by horde. 
---
That's one big reason I dug into grinding vs questing - questing just sucks as alliance. 
---
As Horde though it doesn't seem nearly as bad.
---
What specifically is it that's killing your desire to play the game in MC?
---
Bad guild? Bad class choice? Not enjoying raiding?
---
Because BWL is just an upgraded MC. So it won't solve any problems you have today.
---
Can confirm this is **not** happening in Retail. My guild has a Solstice Celebration that relies heavily on Plain Letters changing hands between players, and it is working as usual.
---
Well aint you just a cunt.
---
1 of every class but 2 priests (dwarf healers!!! Far superior compared to 2 hpals as fearward is king) and 2 mages has always been the optimal comp. Especially now that we use 1.12 itemization. The reason a lot of the best premades run more than 1 warrior is simply because the class is so popular, especially with high end players.
---
Oh absolutely it doesn't make sense , i could put them on a hidden bar and just click them there but I just spell book it every time lol
---
Do you need fire protection pots in bwl?
---
Stand still at max range, preferably.
---
This post brought to you by hunter gang
---
Just play the way you want, maybe others will join. When I queue up with my mate we always attack Iceblood tower and the next tower when we took the first one. And most of the times we have someone with us, so its easier!
---
Haha friends
---
I always found engineering a better pair to mining than blacksmithing. You tend to loot better items than you can make if you play competitively at all.
---
imagine being stranded in the open world   
---
this post was made by the mage gang
---
Misunderstood - i personally enjoy enhancement
---
This. Absolutely.
---
It went from "glad to be back in AV" to "WTF" to "never want to enter this shit anymore" so quickly...
---
Just time to go to exalted... 
---
PS: you need 999 extra rep points after 21k to exalted...
---
Love being a druid for this lol. Favourite thing to do as a druid is water quests.
---
I can get to the mobs faster. Run away from pvp or chase someone down 
---
But the all time most fun to do is look like a nice passive walrus thing. Time the opposing factions breath. As they start swimming up;entangling roots.
---
They wont even fight back. Just keep trying to swim upwards. Just keep casting entangling roots.
---
9/10 they drown. The other 1/10 /wave at them go into walrus and swim away. Try again in a minute when they're back under the water.
---
If that mage is struggling to beat the ret in meters than he needs to be gkicked for his own health. He’s obviously mashing the frostbolt key with his forehead while he’s trying to jerk off with both hands and play at the same time.
---
lmao, bet most warlocks are waiting/wanting to die because healers don't heal them in AV. when i was grinding if i ever got to 5-10% i just hellfired and started again. that really only happened when i walked in without food water tho or when i just wanted to afk some time away
---
&gt; I personally don’t mind its client side so they can do what they want!  
---
But you spend your time telling others about it
---
Yankees suck too
---
Ik but i play on A pve server so it wouldnt be that usefull.
---
Sorry for having fun, loool
---
As a healer, Ever get personally offended when a lock is wanding at like 1/3 mana? Like I’m offended you don’t think I can handle this shit aha
---
Although some of your %s may be off (I am unsure tbh) I still think it's laughable of how many people think they going to be breezing through Naxx and farming it lol. They in for a rude awakening especially in casual guilds. 
---
Compared to vanilla obviously a lot more guilds will do these raids but its not going to be farmed by all guilds like some people think
---
Not so much a question, but Thank you to all of the holy priest pioneers who discovered the lasher farm more than 10 years ago and the people who made wonderful youtube guides in classic to teach us how to do it.
---
I honestly don't know how I would make any gold on my crazy work schedule without it.
---
&gt;It's 3AM in the morning
---
Not to be confused with 3am in the afternoon.
---
Missed it by that much
---
Ethical raid pro tip: If your guild doesn't care enough to look at logs and buffs from past encounters, the odds of you successfully clearing Naxx, AQ, and possibly BWL are very low.
---
Sure, you don't need to raid in a PvE spec.  You don't need to bring mana pots, flasks, protection potions, or resist gear.  You don't need to do any prep work with knowing strategies and placement.  Through sheer dumb luck and stubborn persistence, you too can take all night to clear MC and wipe to the trash in BWL.
---
Trying to shirk your responsibility as a raider in a guild that is trying to progress is the sign of a poor players.  Suggesting that guilds that take raiding now seriously when the future raids will hinge on players caring enough about their performance are toxic nightmares is beyond naïve.
---
Sure, some guilds go overboard and some are literal Nazis or dictators when they get a full head of steam.  Not all guilds that min/max are bad.  Not all guilds that require PvE specs are bad.  Not all guilds that will question your lack of consumable use are bad.  It comes down to the level of effort you want to put in the guild and raid.  If you are fine being casual, don't bother with that noise.  If you want the purples and T3, you need to be ready to put in the time and gold for it.
---
Raid rares are all BoE.
---
This is what MMOs are to me. The content is fine but the real fun is enjoying the content with others. Even if I'm just farming or running scholo for the 100th time, the people I'm with make the game enjoyable.
---
Ten minute games are novelties now.  All games take at least 20 minutes, even premades are having 20+ min games.
---
what does the 999 do?
---
Apparently 125 wins. I was seeing people with the tabards 1 week and a half ago.
---
It's your own fault if you AFK out
---
Nice I'm definitely gonna swap. Any recommendations on builds or general play-style during questing? I'll look up some rotation guides and stuff too but nearly every guide is end-game raid stuff or super early levels. Thanks!
---
Imagine if there was no raid ui so you have no idea how people are unless you visually inspect them.
---
Keep gear updated for physical damage classes.
---
Also, if you have gold, pay people to boost you through dungeons. That's a double whammy because you can possibly get some good gear from the dungeons in addition to the quests and XP.
---
Lastly, level engineering. AoE bombs that stun are a life saver. Can save you more than a few corpse runs.
---
There is a difference between horde and alliance with queue times though. Due to longer queue times for horde on most battlegroups, we are far more committed to winning as we have to sit in queue for 15 minutes to get in the next AV
---
I know right. MT = Star
---
With the way loot works in Classic raids, unless you’re a Druid or a tank, there’s almost always 5-10 other people that need the same gear as you.  Nobody should be expecting loot ever. If you have somebody that does have the expectation that they deserve gear because they exist and are a certain spec, get those fuckers out of your raid and fast. Do you want loot drama, because that’s how you get loot drama...the kind that breaks up raid groups and destroys guilds.
---
Is druid shapeshift a magic that can be dispelled?
---
Learn First Aid, because bandaging is a far faster way to heal yourself up than eating. And don't forget that Healthstone is a really short CD - use that as well to allow you to lifetap more without needing heals. But as has been said elsewhere, don't Life Tap all at once. Use a little here and there so you can keep your HP and MP both at steady levels - remember, your mana doesn't need to be totally full to cast spells.
---
Happens to em too, assume it's an add-on glitch. You can right click on the icon on your minimap and join that way.
---
You can **use** bandages at a much lower skill level than it takes to make them.
---
Healing yourself completely in 1-2 ticks is pretty great.
---
yes and? i have a 60% maunt and i do not scary of lose
---
Ret is terrible.  There is nothing it does which can't be replaced by someone more useful, that is a simple fact.  You can easily have a holy paladin keep up wisdom/light if the raid wants it.  You can easily have other classes put up the Nightfall debuff if the raid wants it.  This is reality.
---
There was a post a week or two ago about a guy who was putting up like 97s+ for logs for Ret.  THis guy was probably one of the better ret paladins there was.  He was geared out the ass, and he would have been doing like 50s as a warrior/rogue.  A guy almost perfectly geared and doing incrdibly well was about as useful in the raid as a mid-tier warrior/rogue for damage.
---
Is that going to stop you from killing fights?  No.  But why take them?  If you are good enough to do that, why not be something more useful?  Why do you feel the need to justify yourself when a massively geared paladin topping out damage wise is about on par with a mediocre warrior/rogue?
---
This isn't just a lol DPS meters either.  It's also the larger concept.  What if all the paladins wanted to be ret?  And all the warriors decide they want to go arms for pvp and not respec for raids.  Making this glorious justification for ret maxes out at 1 ret paladin.  WHy does this one person get super special treatment to play "what they want" and everyone else just accepts it but I bet you wouldn't like it if a rogue decides he just wants to bow shit to death.
---
Ret fucking sucks.  That's reality.  If you want to be ret, go nuts and I hope you have fun.  Don't expect other people to cater to what you want though.
---
If you don't give a shit about raiding now, you'll be replaced with someone who does when content gets harder.
---
I'm not talking about whether MC is hard or a cake walk.  Guilds that look at logs, at buffs, at debuffs, they are doing so to identify those that will be the best candidates for harder content.  Skill at your class doesn't happen overnight.  Caring about raiding doesn't happen overnight.  If you don't care enough as a healer to bring mana pots and let tanks die because you are oom, why on earth would a guild want you in harder content where you go oom even sooner?
---
If all you care about during the raid is the gambling addon and have zero fucks given for consumes, optimal performance, and the like, then your tip is a very good one and will help weed people out of the guilds that are actually trying to find quality people.
---
You might be right but only time will tell. 
---
Ret paladins have cleared all content in the game in both vanilla and pservers. All our information points to things being easier because players (even paladins) are better than they were in vanilla and stuff was notoriously overtuned on private servers. My guess is that Ret pallies will continue to be fine though this aswell. Even dads might get farther this time.
---
I would be a dedicated player still if it wasn’t for the whole Hong Kong issue that blizzard ropes themselves into.
---
Ever since then I uninstalled every blizzard game I had and canceled any subs I had... haven’t looked back since (except for browsing Reddit every once and awhile to see where the game is at)
---
January 14th
---
Thank you
---
They can farm dungeons with a group of people! Strat live (5 man) or DM East (2-3 man) are my favorite ways to make gold on my warrior.
---
yeah the worst will be if both SF and SHGY get capped but even then itll be like 1-2 players getting pissy about it while ppl like me actually did that on purpose to start up a turtle
---
In ulduar we had an officer argument over main tank priority. It was officers arguing for selfish reasons under the guise of what would benefit the raid the most.
---
To get them installed...not to use.
---
Reasons to bring a ret paladin raiding:
---
1. Buffs
---
2. As a joke.
---
3. ?
---
I did Ony for the first time ever last night, and I got the head. My rogue friend is mad at me too
---
i mean it's without a doubt the best weapon in the game for feral main tanking and also for dps. which is what im guessing he was talking about
---
wtf GoTW only costs 1200 mana? Arcane Brilliance costs 3400 and in my all spellpower raid gear it means i have to drink between each group.. considering bringing my pvp gear to raid so i have a big enough mana bar to buff twice before drinking lmao
---
Knowing what I know now? I wouldn’t have touched classic with a 30ft pole if I knew what was to come.
---
Thrash blade is sweet, specially if you're horde. Don't underestimate it.
---
0 hks, but tons of honor from killing Bal/galv and lieutenants.
---
Nope. Druids were invented to not use magic.
---
Blacksmithing is pretty bad at making money unless you're one of the only people on the server who can make some epic pieces.
---
Herbalism is good if you're going to devote time to farming, alchemy is probably best if you're looking for more passive income
---
It's not a rare either.
---
Yea I played range in vanilla but it's been so long don't super remember the fight. But I already know Vael going to be rough for my raid group early on. We do good dps but people are still fucking dumb. They start attacking shit instantly even for months when tanks &amp; raid lead say "give tanks 3-5 seconds to get threat". We've gotten a shit ton of daggers to drop too so our dagger rogues going to be back stabbing like crazy and pulling threat. Makes me mad because its so fucking easy to not pull threat but already know we going to wipe multiple times because of it.
---
The biggest change I notice when switching between Retail and Classic is AoE loot.
---
It's soooo good.
---
It wouldn't affect the game that much anyway. But no changes is no changes.
---
Assuming always tanking? Is it just farming for drops?
---
Looks like gear is a big factor here, as well as just trying with dps, thanks for the logs man
---
I fly to winterspring to kill furbolgs or alliance while I wait.
---
It does. But the button won’t light up as the spell icon would.
---
I use HS with a start attack command. And only my weak aura will show that HS is queued.
---
Oh, I won't even pretend my numbers are on point, they are estimates after all.   You are 💯 on this as well.   As a member of one of the few guilds who did kill the 4H and Kel in vanilla, I know precisely what's coming.   Many of these people fought the Wrath version and think they know the fights, and ItEmIzAtIoN will save them... they have a pimp hand coming in strong to the side of the face, but that's a while off yet.
---
I'm a HPala who wants to start doing some 5-man tanking to get easy Argent Dawn rep.
---
What's the Defense Cap for 5-mans and UBRS, and what would be consideres the minimum to tank them as a Paladin, Scholo and Strat Undead in particular?
---
you can upgrade your insignia to the epic one only after the exalted+999. There may be other perks but that's all I know of.
---
Reminds me of the time I replaced all my friends spells to tell I’m gay everytime he casts something
---
When using slow weapons on a warrior, use slam instead of heroic strike to increase DPS.  This doesn't work well against fast attacking opponents and should be used with the slam macro:
---
As a 54 shadow priest, is BRD runs still the best way to level until 56 (healing) before LBRS? Then 58 start UBRS/STRAT/SCHOLO?
---
Absolutely, anytime. I'll Msg you if we get any 100% no consumable data.
---
ah ok, i knew about the final rank of insignia but i was wondering if i missed something else
---
Lol, this so very much. Hit that life tap between trash pulls so I can crank up my numbers. I also heal the pets because no one else does and we are so geared we don't need that much heals. But the pets still need buffs and some healing scritches. If only I had a bigger mana pool.
---
Well, if your guild plans to BWL get them on the threat meters asap.   It's likely if they don't have it by then and understand threat well, they will cause a wipe.
---
Is there a working summon companion pet macro that won't dismiss the pet if it's already summoned?
---
Oh yeah okay bud, sorry! You do awful dps and your sole utility has nothing to do with damage output. Am I allowed to use that as an argument as to why we shouldn't give you dps gear?
---
The answer is no, obviously. 
---
Jesus Christ.
---
As a warlock, you can summon yourself. Forgot your drakestone? No problem, summon yourself then hearth and get the neck, then accept your summon. Legit hacks.
---
Not sure how taking the deserter debuff and going back into 20min queue is worse than just sticking a long game out
---
Warcraft Classic is not a race
---
by Veqq, Bloodsail Buckaneers
---
I posted my macro and we won 2 out of 2 games.
---
 = ~ ` One Big Deathball ` ~ =
---
 - Wait 15 seconds at SHgy
---
 - If they ride past so do we
---
 - If they hit Belinda we
---
 - ram em from behind
---
 - murk em all
---
Today people started shouting me down with Galv &gt; LTs &gt; FW etcetera..
---
I said you couldn't wait 15 seconds?
---
Holy Flame Wars Batman!  People went bat shit crazy.  Then I talked them down, we grouped up and we won the match.  Here is what I said.
---
This is not a racing game.
---
You have fast mounts so you never loose the Big Deathball,
---
not so you can out run it.
---
Always racing to finish line, to get a pole position for some future game that never comes.
---
People have been conditioned to treat all computer games as racing games for the compulsion feed back loop.
---
It's music.
---
If we wait 15 seconds, team up, and see what they are doing we can always play a song that counters theirs.
---
But if you race to some imaginary finish line, leaving 1/3rd of your death ball behind ...
---
Warcraft is not a racing game, it's music.
---
l2p
---
Perhaps it has changed a bit in the past couple of days, but Alliance have a pretty set strategy.  Rush drek.  Yes you might go for galv and FW/FWRH, but they would ignore towers and go for the boss.  The aim was to go in and end the game in &lt;12min.  Alliance by and large all stuck to this plan with often VERY few people every defending, like 2-4 tops.
---
Horde are the ones who have a split option.  They can accept the zerg for fast games and take towers/Balinda for bonus honor, or they can try to win.  Since Alliance are heavily dedicated to a set strategy, Horde variance is what determines the outcome of the game.  Ignore the Alliance zerg and Horde almost always lose.  Fight the Alliance zerg and Horde have a decent chance to win.  THe problem is this makes the games go from &lt;12mins to 30+.  There is also debate about HOW horde defends.  Some want to defend FW/FWRH, others want to split the alliance zerg at the start of the game.  It stems from two different types of strategies.  Defending FWRH is aimed at delaying the Alliance enough for Horde to cap and  win, but it has a higher chance of failure.  SPlitting the raid has a high chance of success, but it dramatically increases the chance for a slower game.
---
Horde decisions determine how most AVs will go.  Too many people doing too many different things make it awkward for everyone.
---
My guild has gotten so lucky with viskag. We have had 6 drop, and four them were 4 weeks in a row. Still no OEB tho
---
If they release TBC and you continue, prepare to bow down to them and be used solely for sheep and quirky spells teal. For buffs you'll just be parked outside :(
---
As a shaman, you can hearth every 15 minutes, infinitely slow a mob, and travel in near mount speeds at lvl 20
---
More so just the lack of mechanics in MC. Every fight is just as simple/easy as the last one. Been clearing 10/10 since 5 weeks post launch and it’s gotten monotonous. I love raiding, and playing resto shaman, I’ve just gotten bored of the repetition. I’m 8/8 tier 1 will full epic offpieces besides trinkets at this point. Been having a lot of fun pvping but I would rather just go enhancement for that
---
You still need herbalist gloves to avoid failure on Black Lotus.
---
When the item is crafted it is given one of the affixes such as "of the Eagle" or "of Shadow Power". Certain ones of those are among the best items you can get for that slot. Pretty low chance at getting the one you really need. I wouldn't spend too much money chasing the perfect roll unless you're bleeding gold.
---
honestly, if u blow the raid up like that, u deserve to be on loot probation
---
I would just gquit. I love our ret and we all give him a hard time because at the end of the day he knows where he stands on loot. Hand of Sulf is his but outside of that he's bottom priority. He is even a good ret, second best on our server, but he isn't lying to himself about loot.
---
300 to 305 is the equivalent to +3% hit (no difference between yellow and white, but basically when talking about hit cap we always refer to yellow). 2 percent comes from the actual weapon skill, and 1% because the first +hit percent is neglected when the difference between your target's defense and your weapon skill is higher than 10.
---
I’d love to see it, gonna see if I can get some of my slackers dps up
---
If you are a main tank feral and not using pummelers on every boss in a geared raid group you are going to have a bad time. of course for trash, warden staff/ unyielding maul is best. i main tank 4 bosses in mc for our raid including rag, and if you dont use pummeler your melee will die in execute phase. TPS is 1000x more important than mitigation in boss fights. basically if you want your dps to go as hard as possible threat &gt; mitigation 9/10. this is true for horde at least. alliance have it a bit easier with salv.
---
Change some abilities, like druids "Omen of Clarity". It's passive that you need to recast every 10 minutes ... was changed to permanent passive in TBC.  
---
Ability to link your crafting profession in chat.    
---
Summoning stones.  
---
Question and exclamation marks for quests.  
---
10 minute mais between your characters.
---
You know, in Eve Online, you learn quick to trust no one, not even your own corporation and alliance.
---
The only way to create anti-scammer protection is to have a third party hold the money from both rollers and then give both sums to the winner.  Anything less is going to back fire stupendously if you are opening it up to the whole server.
---
'in any content' you won't have done past bwl
---
There are serious musicians.
---
Why are the only people allowed to claim the title "serious" the racers?
---
This is what is wrong with guilds like &lt; APES &gt; they aren't actually playing the game.  They are racing past most of the game and ignoring 99.9% of the game.  Very quickly.  Because first place.
---
There _are_ serious musicians, and Warcraft Classic is not a racing game.
---
Did the tide come in?
---
Why not just play holy?
---
Pretty sure those goggles are only special for twinks in the 29 bracket.
---
Lol, ain't that the fucking truth
---
I guess it's in how you want to define good. If we're all playing the game, clearing content in reasonable time and enjoying ourselves then I'd say we're doing good. 
---
Some would argue that the hight of dps is all that is good in which case why bring anything other than dagger rogues, fury warriors and a few frost mages for dps? Maybe a token hunter for lolz?
---
First, some gearing advice:
---
Red mageweave pants
---
Dreamweave vest
---
Dreamweave gloves
---
Dreamweave circlet (requires lvl 45)
---
All amazing int/spellpower items you'll be using for a long time, altogether should be available for around 20g total on the AH. It's worth the investment.
---
As far as rotation goes, here's your priority list:
---
1. If clearcasting procs, use chain lightning
---
2. If elemental mastery and chain lightning are both up, pop elemental mastery and use chain lightning
---
3. If the enemy is at &lt;10% health, melee them down. Ideally you should have a fast one-hander and a shield.
---
4. Otherwise Lightning bolt.
---
That's pretty much it. Most of your attacks are going to be lightning bolt. When soloing, don't bother with totems unless you're fighting an elite (mana spring is okay if you know you're going to be standing in one spot for a good long while). You can use rank 1 earth shock to interrupt, but don't use shocks as part of your regular DPS rotation.
---
You shouldn't generally be pulling more than 1 enemy at a time if you can help it, but if you accidentally pull 2, then, while chain lightning without elemental mastery or clearcasting isn't strictly the most mana efficient thing to do, it may be necessary to use it on cooldown to survive. If a double pull is unavoidable, try to wait for elemental mastery to come off of cooldown and open with it. You can often kill one enemy before the two of them get to you if you open a double pull with elemental mastery-chain lightning. Consider dropping earthbind and getting away in ghost wolf form if you accidentally pull 3.
---
The reason you should melee down enemies at low health is to trigger the five-second rule and allow for some mana recovery between fights. Using this strategy, individual kills are slightly slower, but it works out to be faster over large numbers of pulls because you're saving mana and not having to stop and drink as often. For your weapon imbue, using rockbiter or flametongue (whichever is higher-ranked at whatever level you're at) works out to be better than windfury for this particular use case because windfury's damage is inconsistent and often "wasted" when the enemy is at low health, while flametongue and rockbiter is a consistent dps increase.
---
I'd probably rather give it to a Ret over a boomkin.
---
&gt; I also find it pathetic whenever alliance say "just put people on defense" ... while never needing to send anyone on defense themselves.
---
lmfao this is the best isn't it?
---
Ally scream at horde to adapt - horde adapt and play defense. Ally get stomped, instead of adapting themselves, they make premades to stack the deck even MORE in their favor.
---
If alliance actually defended and did what horde have to do they would win a lot more often. But they refuse, thankfully for Horde.
---
Any suggestions for places to farm as enhancement shaman (pre-bis with unstoppable force)? 
---
I mostly play early in the morning and solo.
---
It failed quite regularly (albeit my sample size is small)
---
Mountain silver sage will also often take more than one attempt.
---
I’m undead/troll with my herbalists.
---
Because majority of the time you join a turtle and then it leads to "lets summon icyboi" and then that is easily 20 mins of fuckery followed by another 20 to finally get to van
---
Yes, if their DPS is actually terrible. His point was preventing people from acquiring gear that they can use just because of their spec, and with no respect to real world results is pedantic at best.
---
He didn’t even bring into account the fact the few pieces of raid gear that are legitimately excellent for Ret Spec scale just as effectively on a Ret Paladin as they do with other classes.  Ret’s baseline dps is just so low that specialized dps classes of equal ilvl will out produce them.  But a 50dps upgrade is a 50dps upgrade regardless of the class it’s on.
---
tbh, I’ve seen a lot of “ret pally BiS” lists that are just straight garbage and convince people they should be rolling for gear that’s just straight shit for them, but that’s not a specifically ret pally problem, that’s a “people don’t know how to play their class” problem.
---
I think I’d rage quit if this happened to me on my mage. LMAO

After 5/5 wand spec you can do what ever u want, healing up to scholo/strat and full brd is fine in shadow, just get some decent healing gear after 50ish.
---
So go what ever u think will help you.
---
I started off with that plan but I started to enjoy doing ret. I read about the spelladin and was hooked on seeing that through to naxx. It may not be great since things are different then how they were on pservers. Only time will tell.
---
I’ve been in IT for 15 years and this is the most “I’m still a student or maybe a recent grad” post I’ve seen in a bloody long time.
---
If you don’t think that quick fixes, temporary solutions and compromise aren’t “basic dev shit” then you have a lot to learn.
---
How many places can mages port to in retail now, and why is theramore one if them?
---
I use two methods as a, one is polying the hunter and killing the pet so you stand a chance, OR you poly the and get in that hunters dead zone with a frost nova and send him to the shadowlands as fear instille his eyes.
---
11/40
---
Ganking lowbies is a dick move, regardless of the server. PvP servers allow you to be a dick, but it doesn't force you to be a dick.
---
if they trap all the ally in turtles the 40 min queues become 80+ min...they have 40 min now because games are running 10-20.
---
&gt; semi-healthy human will be able to play 18-20 hrs a day without getting hospitalized, so there's little to no reason to account share.

Still a requirement to roll

Can you recommend a good video? I’m looking to do my first holy priest farm on the lashers.
---
PvP and AV in one sentence
---
I bought both and swap between them depending on what I'm doing. You would be right - it's an incredibly small and minor gain, but it's also trivial to have and swap. I use item rack to swap between general spell power gear and more powerful frost gear when I have no need for other elements (i.e. shooting bosses in MC with frostbolt).
---
Well, you will stay exalted forever, so might as well just get both, and its not like you use firespells a whole lot, unless you pvp. And considering spell power isnt really the most important stat for pvp, its not really worth buying anything but the frost one, imo. Not before mages are fire specced, imo.
---
I don't know what to tell ya, modifiers work fine for me.
---
Keep em, they're yours
---
Step 1 ) roll priest
---
Step 2 ) get blade of eternal darkness
---
Step 3 ) use mind vision to pull entirety of dungeons
---
Step 4) ?

Profit!

Yeah, seems to be bot. I spotted this guy few hours ago, then logged in again and... He was still in the same place. Already reported.

---
You don't have to tank to farm dungeons, though you can usually get groups faster as a tank. DM East will be hard to 2 man if you're not a tank, but 3 man with a warrior tank, warrior dps, and healer is super easy.
---
And yes, specifically farming for Righteous Orbs in strat live, and farming for thorium/herbs/foror's in DM:East. Vending/DEing the blue drops from dungeon runs is good gold too! Scholo is also good to farm just because you kill at least 9 bosses that each drop a blue item that you can vend, adds up quick if you're doing quick runs!
---
Regardless, it's a silly comparison. Both dagger and sword rogues are S tier, along with DW fury. 2H fury for ally is more like C tier, potentially A strictly with OEB/BRE on cleave fights. When the argument is people playing what they want, this can clash with a lot of raids' mindsets of wanting the best performance possible.
---
The “cleansing” timer is not necessarily synced with the “plucking” timer, just FYI

Raw Nightfin Snapper are good to make Nightfin Soup.

However you don't need to go in AV for them! you can get them in Eastern Plaguelands, Winterspring and a load of other places😅

What about the totem that reduces threat? use that for the first 10 seconds, then swap.
---
Yes. Theres no reason to have them on the screen. I dont use actionbars for professions either.
---
Not really since epic mount is prohibitively expensive people will just buy one as it is now.

Your tiers mean nothing. A blind naked Hogger could clear the entire game using an imaginary stick. Kek.
---
I still have fun playing arcade games from the 80s in MAME. Insane graphics don’t make a great game, but they can make a poor quality game seem better than it actually is.
---
Plus the beauty of simple graphics is you don’t limit your game to only being played by the smug elitists on Reddit.
---
Dang 30% crit seems really high. Is this with raid buffs or unbuffed.
---
“Beginning of weapon swing timer” and “just as your last swing completes” is the same moment of time though
---
We are the hero, I don't know what game your playing, but we are meant to be something like a hero unit from Wc3. Rather you like it or not that is how the game portrays the player characters. 
---
Also that tired false line about how Superman is boring is something only idiots will say. Heroes lose all the time and even in winning they don't always come out better.

Not gonna lie man same level range I quit all my homies were close to 60 and I was stuck but I promise you rogue life is the best life it’s so damn fun once you get gear it turns into a whole different game trust me! Just keep grinding
---
When you're done questing and are ready to start tanking the level 60 dungeons!
---
The nightfall guy isn’t there for their own dps, they are there to buff the raids dps. Reason why you do wingclip spam is to land as many hits on the boss as possible to proc the weapon. A ret has no place in any competent raid group
---
The math is all over the paladin discord. If you want I can send you the link when I get home.
---
Pservers had bad tuneing and items are scaling totally different in classic then they did on pservers.
---
go back to AV
---
What trait do you like the most in these characters exactly?
---
Play a warrior
---
But be prepared, it can be a slog sometimes.
---
Sounds like you would be down with rogue or Hunter in my opinion.
---
Check child Security in your Battle.net Account
---
hit 60 first then think about respeccing imo.
---
Play a monk!
---
Edit: jk just read the name of the subreddit
---
Right, processing is valueless because the barrier to doing it is effectively zero. As you say, things with long cooldowns will have (some) value, and difficult-to-acquire recipes will have a period of time where their product is worth more before the supply increases and demand drops. 
---
In light of that, choosing a gathering profession (absent a production profession to support) is essentially just “do you want your extra 10% bonus loot from nodes, corpses, or dungeon trash?”
---
Personally I think it's fine that horse have to wait so long. Alliance were unable to play at all before battlegrounds came out because of horde.
---
I've experienced with healing in raid after being (rightfully) threatened with a gkick if I ever tried DPSing again.
---
Again, you can argue as much as you want. That won't make ret any good.
---
Works for horde at least, the alliance NPCs always get killed.
---
Haha! I did. Thank you.
---
Yes!!!!
---
Play Alliance :)
---
So being able to cleanse it dosent mean you get to loot it? Seems kinda strange
---
there’s literally databases of the gold values of all items over the lifespans of vanilla servers. it’s not speculation except for the uninformed.
---
No they aren’t
---
Yeah, even if you lose 4 in 40 min It’s better then one 40 min win

Just stand in his melee range/ between 5-7 yards so he can't hit you with his ranged abilities. Mostly spamming fire blast, cone of cold, and arcane explosion.
---
Dang, thanks for the detailed response! 
---
This info will make a huge difference swapping over since I really only know elemental from Cataclysm and later. Been running dual-gathering professions so that gear definitely shouldn't be an issue to obtain. 
---
Appreciate all the help!
---
Dont worry, it's not classic
---
No problem! I't isn't bad at all. If you are main tanking all bosses or dpsing as cat then the mcp grind can get a bit insane. Mcp is just an insane item, its what makes druids the best threat tanks in the game.
---
It's fairly minor at the scale I'm working with. Honestly it's sort of a meme how much I die at this point so I keep rolling with it.
---
awesome thank you!
---
Plenty of guilds don't bring ret, and plenty allow their healers to get off spec items.
---
&gt;	Warcraft Classic is not a race
---
And that’s like, your opinion man.
---
Nothing honorable was ever intended with the honor system.
---
It would take you forever to kill anything.
---
Only reason I can think of this happening is you critting for big numbers early in a pull. Over a long boss DW should be heroic striking way more, so threat should be much higher if his damage is similar or higher.
---
2h warrior fury DPS on alliance is actually pretty strong if you utilize slam correctly. You should look up Marrow who is an ally warrior doing tons of damage with slam.
---
Grob is already becoming Horde Skewed, and most of the raid guilds are full Horde side. You'll be struggling just as much here as you would elsewhere.
---
You didn't waste 6.5g on the 2 minutes we're killing rag???? BENCHED
---
Whitemane has a good dueling population outside Org.
---
I remember doing a game in raid where we would do a roll of X number, anyone interested would say "in" then everyone rolled. The highest roll got paid highest minus lowest by the lowest roller. Ie, if it was a /roll 500, and the highest was a 477, the lowest was a 37, the person who rolled a 37 paid the highest roller 440g.    
---
That was in MoP though.
---
If you have skinning then you can just have guildies make you the leather armour you need for you. Grab mining or herb with leatherworking
---
Ghosts can also suffer fatigue. Its possible to get too far out in the ocean to ever get back to your body.
---
I wouldn't worry about the defense cap. The death bone stuff out of scholo is ok. Stockade pauldrens, medallion of marshal Morris and cloak of warding are relatively cheap boes to augment your tank set. Any t2 you might have is worth wearing.
---
If you can afford it the quel'serrar is a decent tank weapon (30sp over crusader). For rings I wear song of ironforge (save the princess reward) and the av exalted ring.
---
You dont need to be full protection soec. As long as you have 3/3 improved righteous fury you should be ok for the undead instances. If you're all the way holy, holy shock actually is good for single target threat (you can even use divine favor to guarentee a crit)
---
Why spend 3 hours in MC when you can spend one? Time is money
---
Do you have weekends off? I'm in a guild on Sulfuras and we're looking for a few more warlocks to add to our second raid team, we raid Sunday night starting around 7:30 pm. If you're interested feel free to shoot me a message and I'll give you more info.
---
Oh, please. Don't pretend there are complicated mechanics at play here when you've exhausted all your arguments. What is it? We can't possibly comprehend what's going on here unless we've raided as ret? Is that it? 
---
Come on. Ret DPS is garbage, all you're theoretically good for is Nightfall + judgement of wisdom. End of the story, whether I raided as ret in vanilla or not.
---
Every spec is viable. 
---
That being said, I leveled with a shield till \~30 and it was fine. 2H doesn't even get noticeably better until around that point anyways, when the good 2H weapons become available. Of course, once you finally do get a nice bigass 2H axe, it's hard to go back to shield for solo questing.
---
Also, no one really does the kiting between swing timer thing. This shouldn't be a factor in your decision. 
---
Lastly, just noticed the OP's post was deleted. What was wrong with it?
---
blizzard also stealth nerfed devilsaurs which ruined mafia wPvP which was fun as hell, and ruined devilsaur economy. Blizzard hates fun hates classic and wants it to fail i know it.

I lost 3 games out of 30 as Alliance yesterday, dunno what you're talking about.

Tell me, where did the death roller touch you?

An orc fury tank definitely wants perds and CHT over anything with Deathbringer

Note: this does not work from inside an instance.

5 minutes before you're going to tank MC.

Ya that'd be a reason.

What’s your gear look like? Are you not struggling to hit 9% and not be dead half the time while Mting?
---
Sure as hell notice the dps using consumables vs those that aren’t. 
---
I know for damn sure who are getting BWL invites.
---
The Virgin min-maxer vs the Chad laid-back raider.
---
Ah okay, so there's the "real world" where ret are allowed in raid, and there's... The alternative reality where I live? Where tanks and healers "put up" with people like me?
---
Look at how you've moved away from numbers and actual arguments, to "wellllll we're casual so blah blah blah". Why do you think you're doing down that road now as far as arguments are concerned? Because that's the only route you can go at this point. And we both know why that is.
---
Seriously.  If he thinks it's going to fly in a semi-hc guild, he's going to have a bad time.
---
These posts are kind of old but I'm happy for you.
---
Warrior - leveling: expected dungeon lead (will have problems if you dont know how to do the dungeon as the tank). Slowest leveling class. Raiding: shouldnt be hard to get a raid spot
---
Rogue - leveling: The easiest melee class to level apart from the level 10 and 20 class quest for lockpicking and poisons. Raid: might be harder to get a raid spot
---
Hunter - leveling: Hunters are the fastest questers but fall off after P3 (So Ive been told) Raid: might be hard to get a raid spot
---
Druid - leveling: probably the funnest class to level as because you have 3 attack forms, and 2 travel forms. Also the 2nd best quester. Raid: should be easy to find a spot as resto.
---
Priest - leveling: on the slower end due to no movement speed enhancements, easy to get into dungeon groups. Raid: again, healers shouldnt have an issue with finding a raid spot.
---
Mage - leveling: The fastest leveler due to the ability to aoe grind open world mobs and Dungeon cleaves. Raid: shouldnt be hard to find a spot
---
Warlock - leveling: decent leveler, no movement speed buffs but you get a pet to tank for you and that helps alot.  Also has the ability to aoe farm dungeons with the mage. Raid - shouldnt be hard to get a spot
---
Paladin - slow leveler/ mostly healer in dungeons (ret paladins are TRASH). In raid you're mostly just buffing people. Not a fun class imo. (great lore though)
---
Shaman - fast leveler with 2 main roles. Caster dps and Healer, both of which are pretty good. Shouldnt be hard to find a raid spot.
---
What exactly do you intend to do with "new content" that isn't raid logging? I hate to break it to you but if you don't enjoy playing classic as it is now between raids then nothing is going to change with new content.
---
I don't know, but I'm tagging this because I'm also curious.
---
Look up the automated recovery system. I'm on mobile

---
Contrary to what others said I think titanic. I believe the vast majority of guilds will just use flasks on their tanks. 
---
I am in a casual guild (90min MC runs), but with pretty decent officers which played on pservers and they say only tank flasks will be used.
---
What consumables should I stockpile for BWL? Are fire pots going to be as important in BWL as they are for rag? Any less common potions that will come nifty?
---
If you want to have a Hunter alt for farming gold, it will lead to tribute farming. It's difficult, but highly rewarding in gold/hour.
---
For that, you need engineering. 
---
If you want to go that route, keep mining foe engineering supplies, don't waste time on skinning imo.
---
I’m on faerlina as horde and I am a casual 60 mage I really think it isn’t so bad I just don’t like when it’s late at night and bg queues are high

It seems to me the plan is to grind that AV rep then take you’re fancy new pvp gear into WSG.

Warriors: “leaders”

Hahahaha

In the first week it was faster. Now the battles often take 40mins rather than 12mins.

Aw, darn. Thought maybe we could get lucky with the weekend time. Good luck finding a guild! Cool to see a fellow Sulfuras Alliance player!

Warlocks using banish and timing it properly in MC.
---
Cluth heals by any healer before death. 
---
Warriors stance dancing and using their rage properly over 25.

Also mind soothe + fade = poor mans stealth for priests, works really well
---
Idk it definitely wasn't my decision I remember being angry about it lol.
---
It was true a few months ago that low level mats don’t sell well and to just vendor them but my experience is that it’s not entirely the case anymore. 
---
More recently I’ve been pretty successful with selling low level mats collected while leveling my alt and then started to on my main too - mats that I wouldn’t have previously risked putting on the ah due to high deposits (rugged leather &amp; thick leather from skinning, bolts of mageweave/runecloth from fishing).
---
Every single gold farming guide I saw around launch recommended two collecting profs so, many did it and the result was the Ah getting flooded and the prices being super low.  
---
Now, All those dual collecting profs that hit 60 are changing their professions from collecting to crafting. That and those that didn’t spend much time on profs until they hit end game or those that are leveling  alts are buying mats in bulk to power level profs
---
Long story short I would check out your ah to check prices and volume before vendoring all the low level mats, you may be surprised.
---
Why are they useful? Please elaborate. (Just use simple words to us morons can keep up with your high IQ, though. Thanks.)
---
You can always appreciate a hunter who turns taunt off on his pet during a dungeon.
---
Please don't stir away the discussion. I agree, this post can be considered as a long one. But it was written by a person who loves to read (and write), so can't do much about it. You can help by crafting a succint short TL;DR, I would gladly upvote it, be it a post or a comment. But, if you really want to help, you may want to submit the mentioned bug via in-game means. I would be grateful if you do so, thank you in advance.
---
Personally I’d spec Furor and Improved Enrage when tanking low level dungeons. You’re probably going to be doing a lot of shapeshifting in low level dungeons, and Furor guarantees that you’ll always have some energy or rage after you shift. Plus I find a standard “Enrage-&gt;Feral Charge” with Improved Enrage is a good opener.
---
Basically the Balance tree with Omen of Clarity should be your final points. Fill out the Feral and Resto trees first. If you decide to not use Furor/IE when raiding, you can drop those points into Natural Shapeshifter and whatever other Feral talents you want.
---
Damn, you guys should wait until next phase when you can get nexus crystals from them.
---
After listening to one of the latest “countdown to classic”  podcast episodes where a guy going for rank 14 describes grinding AV 16 hours a day 6 days a week I was released from any notion of gaining pvp rewards. I’ve come to terms with it and am able to just have fun now. I get where you’re coming from but trust me, you don’t need the best gear to have fun. Just relax and go crack some skulls.
---
A pally that puts on the appropriate buff and keeps it up without being reminded.
---
Having said that we have to get drunk a lot and sometimes you all just get kings.
---
Supreme. I think only Titan will technically be 'needed' for fights, but I anticipate many casters using Supreme to compete on meters.
---
I agree with that 100%. In your opinion would using a shield help mitigate downtime spent healing between targets, or increase it? Does the added armor and block potential from using a shield outweigh the increased damage of a two hander? Keep in mind the builds I have linked please. 
---
Thanks for your help!
---
tl dr also dont care about pedo erpers
---
If you plan to tank at 60, around 55.
---
Laughs in warlock
---
i've been at every raid, as the rogue lead, and i'm still using Krol Blade/Mirah Song lol. haven't seen any swords anywhere. not even UBRS. i personify bad luck.
---
I'd stay far away, they smell worse than they look
---
smh clearly class favoritsm
---
I think I looked it up and it's not near the flight path. Moonglade Is easiest to get to just have to travel
---
Yeah I feel like when you're struggling on progression you want to keep spirits up and downing easy, quick content like Ony seems like a no brainer.  You could have challenges too, or do "alt runs" where up to (x) amount of people can bring alts instead of their mains (again to help gear up alts) or crap like that.  It's free loot everyone!!
---
Small caveat. Bad premades (yes the ones from the two discords everyone and their mother is in now), although you have the actual good players late at night for groups probably will have 20min games. The actual good premades, through private premade discords, top guilds, rankers for a specific server won't.          
---
There is an INSANE quality difference between the two, considering there is no longer anything stopping from getting shitty players in the discord.

/tar XXX (Put your character name here)

/cast Devour Magic(Rank 4)

This will target yourself, devour magic, then retarget whatever you last had as a target.
---
I use this macro and just move the pets spells about that you want to use (e.g.   spell lock is on ctrl-1, devour magic is on ctrl-2, seduce is on ctrl-1).  FYI, I use a single pet macro for this as below, automatically uses whatever you choose from each pet:
---
/cast Fire Shield(Rank 4)
---
/cast Sacrifice(Rank 6)
---
/cast Spell Lock(Rank 2)
---
/cast Seduction

look it up and find out

---
Nice thanks for the detailed response gonna share with my warriors. I personally favor using deep prot atm but I have the helm only other hard part is chain and I’ve needed hoj too so I guess I should farm that out.
---
The issue is that horde normally either try full zerg, or full defend, when they have a Strat that's easily winnable in 15 or so minutes instead of trying to push to 30minutes
---
I mean, hard packed snow balls and holding the gy is fucking fun.
---
What? I got a footlong delivered to me via Uber Eats today for $7.
---
minor corner case: its slightly relevant while leveling it as you start at 15 rather than zero, meaning you can start picking earthroot immediately and need less nodes to get to mageroyal , past that you're right you wont see the benefit until maxxed
---
Best part is that 3D games don’t need anything better than this if the gameplay is good enough.
---
Seems like a lot of games have forgotten that these days and kinda why game reboots are very successful
---
After starting to eat food, you can go into stealth. 
---
Also macro pickpocket into all your stealth openers. Except Sap.
---
Use the buddy system. Stack two by two so you're not so spread out. Use fire pots after every knock up.
---
Yup weapon chain
---
Weapon damage. 
---
Your backstabs and ambushes will consistently hit harder. 
---
With crusader you are relying on a proc that may never happen during the time it takes you to kill someone.
---
Do it.
---
I dont think I would've done it until the scarlet monastery levels and even then the ravager from herod was so clutch for aoe xp runs. I think RFD would've been the earliest I would've thought about it after getting the scarlet monastery shield. I only say that because before then the shields give such low block and armor values to really consider dropping my dps that low. 
---
If I had to start though I would go for the extra block chance first to get concussive blow as soon as I can. I think prot isnt too strong until you can get pretty deep into the protection tree to have concussive blow and shield slam which bump your dps as a prot warrior a good amount. Tactical mastery and anger management was something that's more useful if you can already spam revenge.
---
Prot warriors have the advantage of taunting and sundering for aggro but you'll find that early on you cant take that much more than any other warrior.
---
I think that’s what he’s saying.
---
&gt; Time is money, friend
---
you a word
---
I don't see why they'd remove it, but then I've got not way of checking.
---
Just get the ranked mounts.
---
Exactly. Since mechanics are so simple and classes are aswell, attendance and usage of required consumables is how guilds pick out people to bench when it comes to that. Unless your parser are very bad, but that’s really hard to do in Classic.
---
Server queues are cross realm, so this has nothing to do with faerlina.
---
Serious question. How can you premade AV?
---
Love how you're getting downvoted for saying the truth.
---
Arms is the de facto dungeon tanking Spec. Outside of maybe DM North and West there's no dungeon that has high damage dealing mobs which you can't 2hand tank. 
---
Hell, even if you notice that your, your healer's gear or something else isn't all that well, or that he isn't comfortable healing you for some reason, slap on a shield and you lose...One more block, Last stand and like 10% armor, but still gain Sweeping Strikes  which is *huge* as dungeons are about AoE control, not bossfights.
---
yes
---
Write a script, you're on linux.
---
Sounds good. I'll be that third party ... now, let's do a 2000g deathroll ... that'll be 2000g from each of you please ... Thanks

I want to know as well! :)
---
No really, a lot of parents will only get a few hours of sleep a night for months after getting a baby, and they will still go to WORK which takes way more energy than autopiloting in a game. If 30-40 year olds can do it for months, there's no reason as to why someone in their 20s couldn't do it for the last push for 2 weeks, especially when they're doing something that requires way less attention.

I'm sure they'll be scarce but I suspect there will be many more riders this time around.

It’s easy, just change your mindset. All these rewards weren’t intended to be goals unto themselves, they’re a passive part of playing this game. “Hey, we see you play AV a whole lot, well here’s access to an epic mount and some epic weapons to make the games that much more fun.”
---
Now it’s like “I GOTTA GRIND OUT EXALTED IN TWO DAYS BECAUSE THAT RING IS MY BIS!!!1.”
---
Also, Classic isn’t going anywhere. We know in advance when the next phase is going to drop, so pace yourself on that timeline instead of having the “server first!” mindset.
---
So we have at least two years of planned content releases, plus however long the game lasts beyond that (If Guild Wars is any indicator that could be 10 years). There’s plenty of time to do everything you eventually want to do, but everybody acts like it’s all gonna end tomorrow so they better grind out what they can today.

It’s baffling. Just enjoy yourself, and reap the rewards as they come. This game isn’t about “efficiency,” it’s about having fun. If being efficient is fun for you, then have at it, but if not just don’t worry about keeping up with those people and you’ll be fine.

I’ve seen a couple of these now. You do great work. Really grab the essence of the zone. Keep up the great work and thanks for sharing.

beautiful

I don't know, they seem ok to me, at least in dungeons. They can't taunt but it's made up by their consec threat, and in raids they can apparently just spam blessing to build insane threat. I don't know if that's efficient at all, all I know is that on ony prot palas can work better than wars because they can keep building threat in p2.

Looks like the best freaking summer camp ever

Deathrolls if you have any depraved addicts on your server.

Win or lose thousands in minutes!

I’m a leader who loves to win. Sounds about right

If they didn't have soo much leeway hamstring kiting would be way easier to do

I've had better luck with Viskag than dal rends dropping.

The water i make can be traded without people paying for it. just learned this.

100%, and it makes it easier to start building a roster of those people now for the future instead of fucking around now, and then come bwl, AQ and such all of a sudden you have a roster but then some of your geared members refuse to pop consumables.
---
Don’t know of any specific active pve servers but if you choose “change realm” from your normal character screen you should be able to see how high the population of a server is at the time. Anything that says “high” or “full” I’m guessing would be pretty active. Then again you might end up on a server with a high alliance pop but low horde pop. Maybe make a character and check out LFG chat to see how active it is before you transfer?

sounds like a failure of leadership.
