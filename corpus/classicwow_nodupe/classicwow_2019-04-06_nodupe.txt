He’s at -27.  One random idiot that got overwhelmingly downvoted does not prove your point.

I'm going to do what I never did in WoW - level my professions with the character and take in all the goodness that is classic in ways my younger self was too impatient to do.
---

---
I'm going to read every fucking word of every quest, talk to any NPC that has a story to tell, peek around every corner and just let the goodness in.
---
Catch me taking a break from fishing to watch the sunset and chat with nerds in the zone. Spin yarns about Chuck Norris and recount that one time I never saw mothman.
---
I admitted I missed his point at least. I don’t remember playing with a click to move for a pet at any point in the games history that I played and I had a beastality hunter in BC. 
---
Their late marketing campaign for BFA was a major hype train which tends to be great at selling out on initial release, but is bad in the long run as it boosts expectations beyond what can actually be delivered. 
---
It could be that they learned their lesson for BFA and decided to keep silent about Classic not to overhype the already pretty hype release. Especially if they're under the "you think you do but you don't." mentality. They may be expecting an already hype release and don't want to skew people's "rose-tinted goggles" enough to be able to drop an 'I told you so' as they really want this to succeed to keep subs up when there are lulls in content. 
---
Ah my bad didn't know

Priest

Mindcontrol strong mobs in dungeons to tank and deal out good damage.
---
Also mindcontrol people by cliffs, for example AB Lumbermill and jump their character off the cliff for ez kill

You are so cool, can I get tips on how to be soooo cool?

I'm rank 14 in breaking bad for sure.

You don’t have to be a min/maxer to know that dwarf priests are much more viable, and can pretty much guarantee you a raid spot. Trying to PUG Ony? You are pretty much guaranteed a spot. In a guild working on BWL? You will be pretty much guaranteed a spot.
---
It is also one of the only choices that you have to stick with no matter what, and can’t respec at end game. Play a shadow priest but are tired of being sat for raids because of a different dps taking your place or your raid wanting to take another healer? You could always change specs and roles. Tired of being sat because you choose human instead of dwarf and your guild needs the extra fear ward? Whelp, better reroll.
---
Priest races are the only thing that matters at character creation if you want to raid at 60. It is a different issue than wanting to play a less viable spec. Luckily though, this issue is only for Alliance Raiders, and doesn’t matter as much if you aren’t as interested in raiding.
---
Tyr's Hand. Damn I've got good memories rushing back just thinking about it :D
---
An atypical, fairly newish thing that you might be interested in, depending on how/if sharding is going to be a thing, would be to utilize exploration leveling to like level 10. It takes longer in normal circumstances, but it could put you ahead or at least keep you competitive by just skipping the early questing nightmare.
---
As an example, I was able to keep pace with a 4 man leveling group on a private server, where there was zero competition. They quested, while I ran an exploration route. So knowing that, if there isn't dynamic respawns or sharding, once classic hits, then exploration will be an extremely viable option.
---
It disproves yours, does it not?
---
Seconding this. I raid oceanic and I have max 200 ms, most of the time i hardly notice it.
---
This, unless they decide to do any patching to adjust class balance and make non-viables viable, which I very sincerely doubt they'll be doing.
---
No it doesn’t.  
---
Just wait until they make more money off of classic wow then they do off of current wow. You will see alternate timeline expansions come out
---
You shouldn’t have told me that
---
Im going to be a pretty casual player because of work, but man... I played a Pserver a bit and just exploring, especially at night was just absolutely awesome and chill. Although I guess thats why I'm going PvP which I know is tough to get the gear, I don't gotta stress keeping up with raiding tears and shit I can just do me and play my class.

Undead Priest!

I'm dreading the glitch that makes someone beat me in world pvp.

Clearly if I lost there was a glitch, cuz I'm an elite ninja who can't lose.
---
Still kinda bummed that I’m going back to a time when Ret and Prot aren’t really viable for raiding. 
---
Still worth it overall. 
---
yes

Bold Strategy Cotton , Lets see if it Pays off for him

Nice try, Hulu.
---
Everyone keeps saying you need all these consumes and buffs to do naxx. Is it really not able to down a new boss every other week and progress slowly ?
---
Even Min/max guilds will want feral druids for certain fights. 
---
Nightmare vale is right; that face...
---
Spirit is worthless to warlocks, but it's great for priests. They can use pre-casting and other techniques to dance around the five second rule and get lots of spirit ticks during a fight.
---
That's great news.  I'm actually shocked.
---
im afraid there will be rets, just like back then
---
so they people didnt mature
---
Totally understand the class identity argument. In our case, a hunter actually wants to do it. I told him it will be boring but he doesnt care. So sounds like its fine for him to do it. Our off tanks actually put out nice dps and often swing anni already. 
---
Yea just was looking for nightfall discussions and found this. Thanks for your 2 cents!

Nah, running from a moose is pretty much the best thing you can do. They're herbivores, they aren't as instinctually prone to chasing you.

Still using a Naga.  I have a K70 right now but I think I'm gonna buy myself an early bday present and get a Huntsman Elite.
---
Weren’t those guys part of the max event?
---
Didn't know that Warriors could fill more than 2 roles. They might need a few extra pieces and such to swap out situationally (i.e. hit pieces, threat pieces), but Druids also need to do that, so it's not worth mentioning.
---
This is the dumbest fucking comment I've read in a while. The fact that you say "Hardcore players do not have fun" is so stupid it's not even funny. It's literally cause they have so much fun that they put in so much time into the game.
---
You are misstaking hardcore players for assholes, and casual for a hippie.
---
I'll buff you but I'm smacking the dragon with my giant hammer.
---
I did, and will again.
---
It’s literally about wow classic?
---
I see that you are a dwarf hater and nightelf cuddler. I agree with you absolutely that people who want to play a NE priest shouldn't worry about not getting a raid spot just because of their race. But dwarves are not ugly, they're amazing creatures created by the Titans themselves and there's a lot of good and interesting lore for anyone who wants to RP a dwarf.
---
As someone who wants to play a holy themed healer in Classic, I looked into priest racials and because of Fear Ward, I grew so fond of the idea of playing a Dwarf, I'm ultimately going to play a dwarf Pally.
---
Speaking of Fear Ward, I think a big thing that seems to get ignored is the fun factor: How much fun is having 5% more spirit compared to having an additional button that has a real impact on the game and happens to be also very powerful? 
---
So it's not always about minmaxing. There are priest who will pick Dwarf because they simply like Dwarf more than ugly purple humans with long ears, or simply because they like the interactivity of that racial.
---
Ok.

10-14 zone A
---
14-16 zone B
---
16-17 back to A
---
17-18 zone C
---
18-20 back to B
---
Sometimes the travel time is worth it when another zone has plenty of green quests and current has yellow, orange that would be tough. Come back here and do the tough ones once you level up a few times elsewhere.
---
I can't believe someone wrote this out and thought it would be a good thing to contribute. Never seen a dumber comment on here.

It's less of *"you have to roll this to get invited"* and more of *"rolling this will make it easier for you to get invited"*

I have a Tartarus but I could never get used to it for some reason. I use a Quickfire Rapid with blue switches, and a Zowie FK2 as I mostly play fps games.

!remindme 3 months
---
My opinion on the matter.
---
1. 40 players is more than enough to handle the end game raids. Therefore, you don't need to min max your character.
---
2. You're going to be seeing your character's ass for 60 levels and then some. Make it an ass worth looking at.
---
3. It's a game, not a job. Have fun with your game play.
---
And for those who claim that only holy dwarf priests are the only priests worth playing because of Fear Ward. Consider that Horde also needs to be able to handle end game raids. And no Horde priest has Fear Ward. Therefore, Fear Ward is not needed for end game raids.

Ventrilo in 2019?

Amen, brother - I'm not even saddled down with that much responsibility but hell if I want to stress over this. I want to take my time and enjoy a slice of my highschool years. 
---
Wait till you get a gander of tauren hands.
---
I was just getting downvoted to hell a couple weeks ago for suggesting that sharding should not be implemented. Glad to see the perspective has shifted.
---
I have the Huntsman Elite, too. Very good KB, IMO. I generally don't like Razer but their quality has been improving the past few years.
---
Can you do this for horde? This was awesome 
---
Not like he would be able to play, Wouldnt be able to target anyone and would just chain tab target between 100 mobs at the speed of light.
---
Yup, lack of a taunt really crippled Paladin tanks.
---
&gt; Prot paladins have tanked everything in the game.
---
Surprising information right there.
---
You can make it work, but it requires extra effort and you need to define "just as good". A slightly above average warrior/rogue is gonna out dps the best ret paladin 99% of the time, just look at the parses 
---
I don't know about giving money to mailbox dancers specifically, but there were definitely people out there who gave gifts of gold or items to female toons because they thought it might be an actual grill.
---
You’re delusional if you think they’re going to specifically reenable follow in pvp when it is almost entirely to the benefit of multiboxers and no one else.
---
What race resto shaman for horde?
---
Mage tanking Krosh Firehand at 2 fps was challenging. I'm very much looking forward to this aspect.
---
u dont need any consumables to progress in naxx
---
Yeah I was thinking of going dagger + shield till I get a good staff.  Wasn't planning on. Putting a pt in 2h spec unless I get a big upgrade for a weapon.
---
I actually would love nat pagles fish terminator to WF people in the face with a fishing pole!
---
Must have ridden the UC elevator thousands of times. Never fell through it even once 🤨
---
Orc stun resist is great for PvP. But honestly if you wanted to be a Tauren that has its advantages as well. 
---
Assimilate or die.
---
The reason I say that is because Naxx has multiple dps/gear check fights and several more that have near (or in the case of Loatheb, actual) mandatory consume requirements in order to beat.  That doesn't mean you're going to be required to run every consumable under the sun to be able to raid Naxx, but it will take some time investment to be properly prepared and I don't think it's really that hard to do.
---
Rogues and their damn logic! Get outta here!
---
I tried one of those mmo mice before and didnt like it. I pretty much used my mx518 through out all of wow. 
---
I use a G502 mouse, it's amazing
---
You're gonna love your Dwarf Rogue. The find treasure is extremely useful in finding chests to skill up your lock picking. Macro together Stoneform and Vanish together and you effectively have a Cloak of Shadows which wasn't introduced in the game until TBC. Honestly, I'm rather surprised at how few dwarf rogues there are.

I have a Steelseries Merc Stealth that I love love love (I used the same keyboard for over 8 years and then bought a new one on Amazon 2 years ago) that broke with a windows 10 update last year. I wasn’t able to find a workaround so I downgraded to windows 8 just to keep using this keyboard.

Lmfao he’s obviously shitting on OP. He’s being sarcastic. Holy shit we have some mentally challenged people on this sub

About that...

I'm going to.  I wanna enjoy my ride to 60.  
---
If you have time to make raids three days a week and are in a good guild you will see all content in a timely manner. Naxx is currently cleared first try on a regular basis, and then later speed cleared in just over an hour. You can say p server but the fact of the matter is the game is completely different than in 04. 
---
The meta is completely different. You don’t need every consumable in the game and world buffs etc just to enter naxx. Nor do you need to be a guild full of min maxers. 
---
Classic wow as a whole is a joke, and that’s pretty widely accepted amongst anyone who has been playing it over the years. If you’re capable of getting to 60, and raiding a few nights a week with a competent guild you will see all available content in a timely manner. 
---
And Classic is meant to recreate 1.12 Vanilla, which had RPPvP servers.

Thank you! 
---
5. Deadmines (and/or finish higher lvl redridge quests)
---
6.  Duskwood
---
7.  Wetlands
---
8.  Northern STV (be ready for pvp from here moving forward)
---
9.  Southshore
---
10.  Few quests in Swamp of Sorrow
---
11.  Desolace
---
12.  At this point (since the level ranges in these next zones can vary considerably) you will bounce between Alterac Mountains, STV, Badlands &amp; a couple of higher lvl Desolace quests (including a pre-req quest for SM) based on your lvl compared to the lvl of the quests available to you in the zones.  This along with Scarlet Monastery will easily get you to 40.
---
Once I hit 40, I bounce around between STV, Feralas &amp; Tanaris (definitely do an Uldaman, ZF &amp; Mara quest run as well).
---
Next will be Hinterlands &amp; Searing Gorge (better yet if Thorium Brotherhood quests are available).
---
Un'goro, WPL, Felwood &amp; Burning Steppes  will be the next zones (you can start running the lower level BRD quests around this time).  Around this time I also augment my questing with several hours (1-2 levels) of farming a particular set of mobs to make some gold for pre-raid bis boe's or epic mount money.
---
Finally Winterspring, EPL &amp; BRD should push you to 60 (stay away from Silithus quests until you need to grind Cen. Circle Rep).
---
This is how I hit 60.  It's not the only way, but it works for me.
---
Ya like others have said, fishing on the back burner and cooking you should be able to keep up and not dedicate much extra time. Alot of quests give recipes or you can find them on a vendor in SW or trainer taught ones. Just hoard all the meat you get and if your are playing with friends take their meat(lol) if they dont need it
---
Seems to me if you joined a guild with the understanding that you were going to raid blind. You would raid blind. If someone wants to look stuff up and know the fights just join a different guild. Someone would join a blind raiding guild to do just that.

Vortex Poker 3 with Cherry MX Brown and a Logitech G Pro Wireless. I play mostly shooters.

Back in the days, I had that ugly Logitech G15 that everyone had, with the LCD display that could be customized to show what you wanted. Nowadays, it wouldn't be very useful, but back then we only had one small monitor so it was nice to see who was speaking in TeamSpeak.
---
On so many levels ...
---
After a long period of failing to get into raiding as an undead warlock (once I discovered what raiding was), I re-rolled as a human female priest solely to abuse it to get into raiding. By level 35 I had a group anytime I wanted one.  By 45, I was in a guild that was egging me on to get geared so I could raid. My first time in MC, I was asked to be on voice chat (vent or ts, I dont recall which). The first time I spoke was followed by a noticeable amount of silence. They got over it, I had a permanent raid spot, and eventually rolled a dwarf hunter (male) to replace my priest with after I was given a chance to prove myself.  I still played my priest when needed, but got to effectively main my hunter when I wanted.
---
kek
---
That’s not how human nature works. People would join the guild, look up fights, and then pretend to create strats so that they feel special and adored. 
---
Nope. I like the aesthetics of the world a lot with the ugly graphics. Don't speak for others.
---
Well it kinda depends on how you wanna clear it, you can do it slowly with less consumes of course. Only really need consumes on loatheb patckwerk 4h sapp and kt.

That should be the one, the Feral ended up getting it because he was really doing great and he had saved up plenty of DKP, so he earned it.
---
Only really works while levelling. If your plan is to run away instead of defend a flag in AV/AB or your plan is to run away instead of trying to kill the enemy FC in WSG then it's the same thing as losing.
---
Q: Will [addon/macro thing] that worked in [client from 2006] be available in 2019?
---
A: If they purposely removed [thing] because it broke the game, odds are it will not make a return in Classic WoW.
---
Other things that will also most likely never be part of Classic WoW: Decursive, SuperMacro, RotationMaster etc.
---
Bingo. The mats for cooking are going to be dropping as you level. It's been a while since I levelled Alliance or undead, but for Durotar the progression is Boar Meat to 50, saving every Scorpid Stinger that drops in the areas by Razor Hill. Kill boars and scorpids like it's your job while you quest. The cook in Razor Hill sells the scorpid surprise recipe.
---
In the Barrens, save Strider Meat and wreck every plainstrider you see. The trade vendor troll sells the recipe for Strider Stew and Thunder Lizard Tails. When you progress to Camp T and have to grind those 60 bristleboar tusks, kill the thunder lizards in that area. 
---
Fast, easy grinding in quest areas; cooking level 150 by level 20. EZPZ.

I had this idea of being the guild enchanter on horde side, since plate spellpower dropped noone could use it and it's fair game for DE, thanks for ruining it.
---
Macros like this are why I grew to hate my Shaman on private servers.
---
Love me some Ducky Shine. 
---
That doesn't sound as bad, just leave a handful of guys and the warlock, others hearth back to repair, get resummoned and the others go do the same.
---
I think this is the most disjointed insane rambling post i’ve seen on this sub. 
---
The amount of clueless answers here...
---
 It's entirely possible to be in a guild that raids one day a week and clear naxx with ease. It's simply not true that you need to be a no lifer/tryhard to raid naxx. Vanilla is going to be really fun, but also super fucking easy. 
---
You'd be surprised by the amount of stupid/horny people around that get off at the sight of pixels.
---
On private servers Alliance players love totem stomp macros. Horde not so much. Go figure?
---
its funny im like a reverse paladin , i want to heal really bad on one but i cbf leveling one as melee
---
tbh though i dont want to be a dwarf paladin either so they are sort of out for me in classic
---
i feel bad for the paladins who want to dps or tank as one but get stuck healing.
---
lol during classic ill make some guildies help power level a paladin for me just so i can heal
---
Troll mohawk is BiS for player characters.
---
Man, does anyone know what the addons are that are being used there?
---
Love the interface and the font.
---
Keep in mind it may take a few hours to get each individual addon set up how you like it (plus tweaking to consoleport as you quest and notice things that are off). For me I was messing with it for like 4 hours, *but I'm really picky*.
---
Once you get it setup it's actually amazing though. This is my go to questing method from here on out now. Hands down. Makes the world and storyline so immersive!
---
I'm a DH though, which makes it a little tricky with all of the movement, so it may work even better with a caster class.
---
There was some pserver out not too long ago, I can't remember which one, but the trees and environment would cause LoS. It was AMAZING.
---
Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that. I just remember that druids are good raid healers. They don't have a threat dropping ability as far as I remember, though.
---
He said in pvp, not leveling 
---
The G602 is even better. Have 3 of them. Worried they will stop making them.
---
But youre asking for money and claiming accuracy?
---
More like hillsbrad. Only horde camp the maestra’s post and other areas in ashenvale since they have a fp on zoam strand
---
Let's be honest, vanilla is gonna be super fun and I'm really looking forward to it, but it's also gonna be insanely easy, especially for someone like you with that kind of experience. I see you're getting mostly clueless comments. Don't listen to the people who claim that you need to be a super no lifer/tryharder in order to raid naxx, it's as far from the truth as it could be. If you've been in a top 10 US guild, you're gonna have an easy time individually and also with ease be able to find a guild that can casually clear all content, including naxx, raiding 1-2 days/week. 
---
I think a lot of it was ping related. As an aussie playing on NA servers with dial-up it was basically a 50/50 chance of dying.
---
Huh?
---
I can relate to this. I'm a completionist, but I've never capped a Horde character. My Alliance heart just won't let me do it. But my traitorous brother has gone full Horde since vanilla so I'll have to roll Horde for Classic. At least one. I'll hit my 60 levels and then level an army of Alliance alts to make up for it. 😝
---
Thanks for the dose of perspective. New things can be good!
---
Logitech g602. Keyboard of any variety with F keys directly above the corresponding number.
---
Legit reason tho 
---
&gt;Edit:. Thanks for the input guys, there was a lot of info I didn't have, but even though it mostly seems negative, I'm still excited to roll an enhancement shaman. Call me a glutton for punishment if you will, but the challenge still has me excited.
---
Here's my two cents.
---
If you're pvping you're either doing WPvP or BGs. WPvP as an enhancement shaman has really three ways it can go. 
---
1. You get jumped/kited. Die without means of closing the gap or doing significant damage
---
2. You get the jump and are in melee range. RNG doesn't go your way. 
---
3. You get the jump and are in melee range. You basically one shot someone. 
---
In BGs - 
---
You will learn exactly what mana burn sounds like. Because every alliance priest is going to make your blue bar go bye bye. Every hunter is going to make you his bitch. Occasionally you will get to ride up to a clothie, dismount, and one shot them (if your gear is good). 
---
This is life of enhancement PvP. And it's the good side of the coin compared to PvE. 
---
Probably UBRS or Strath prenerf.
---
I tossed like fucking 3 of those things because they annoyed me. 
---
Well I want to play Classic. They won't let me.
---
Yet.
---
Min max bad

What is your time frame?
---
Why tf does any of that have to be a microtransactions. Could easily be a challenge or achievement reward for doing something.
---
lol in that same situation myself
---
my buddies are gonna bail off one by one, I know it
---
it will probably just be me and my one buddy left playing after a few months. WE both want horde, but everyone else wants allies, so we will probably end up maining alliance.
---
still, feelsbad
---
I believe the otters were the Allied Athiest Alliance actually :p
---
They just released 5.8!!!
---
Lifelike mechanical squirrel
---
can it handle massive loads of people as well?
---
the amazing thing about the original tech is that on pservers you can walk into IF or Org with an absolute shitload of people, and it runs smooth
---
it can handle capacity
---
can this new client handle it? the fact they are even considering sharding cities makes me worried 
---
I would too if I could figure out how to install on a Mac I’ve tried three times but no luck.

I sincerely hope your father keeps healthy enough to be able to play Classic, you both will have a ton of fun!
---
There's that, and it's not even got a release date yet.
---
Yeah but it sucks when you want to be a Prot Pally but can only do 5 mans... I agree with your sentiment but nobody wants a Paladin tanking their raids. And sadly I don’t blame them. 
---
They’ve always been bad at advertising. They had Mr. T and William Shatner doing their TV commercials. 
---
I’ll never forget “14 year old human Pally in vanilla me” went to Kalimdor LIKE A DUMBASS, because “oh cool, another continent” minding my own business and I see orcish pop up in the chat log... then more... then WAY MORE, like 10-15 different people talking in say in Orcish... I get off the road and try to hide off to the side when I see a whole fucking guild (prob 40 people) coming down the road, they saw me, and I did not have a good time. Logged off for 10 minutes hoping they would move along so I could go rez at my body, they didn’t so I logged off for the night as opposed to them hunting me down at the graveyard...
---
I´m so sorry about your father, I hope you two can have an amazing time playing WoW and have a lot of fun together, try to not to be sad about your father´s future but be happy for the great moments you spent and will spend with him. Best wishes for both of you.
---
Druid can effectively tank and are great off tanks. Feral dps is very viable but consumes are hell. And one balance/resto hybrid is great for a raid but you won't be spamming wrath.
---
Couldn’t that game just be a sudden drop since it’s a remake with tons of information already out there?  Like a “here it is now!” Moment since the preorders have already been going. Alternatively I could also see this being an E3 day one drop if blizzard ends up there.  Pure speculation and I admit I know nothing about how any of this works. 
---
/cheer...
---
You can also be a pain in the ass to kill in BGs...
---
Warrs can still cap armor I think with stoneshield
---
Kul Tiras was a thing in the RTS games...
---
iirc 1 shadow priest per raid is actually preferred. 
---
I turn 15 this month, Im always happy to see people near my age playing WoW I played back in TBC, granted I was 3, so the most I did was run around and mash buttons (My little sister was able to do the same thing when she was 3)
---
Lul
---
Loved this episode
---
For the wild!
---
And they hit like a wet noodle and stand in the back and heal.  I do not do that.
---
did you open the picture and see what kind of cards hes talking about?
---
Certain youtubers and streamers believe they are helping the Classic WoW community but are making it far worse. They’re literally playing and planning out the entire game for you, literally step by step in quests and gear. I understand deliberating on your character and class bc it’s a big time investment, but the freeforming adventure in front of you is part of the game. Spontaneity is lost if youre just doing what you’re told. 
---
While these people have some info that’s good, they over reach into every minuscule aspect of the game. It’s best to cut yourself off from the overspill of info coming out of their mouths. Tips Out is one of these people I’ve grown to not really like. Constantly making ranking videos and needing exact bis for race, talents, professions, rotations, and gear is just overkill. He’s giddy to list everything optimal but ends his videos saying play how u want, something completely contradictory to the other 99% of the video. 
---
Making mistakes with talent points, questing zones, and rotations is a learning experience. These things give you a comparison for when you start doing things differently or correctly. Like Bob Ross would say, happy accidents. It’s part of the journey, enjoy it. 
---
Yup! Even then sometimes the hunters pet would bug out or someone would accidentally tab target something. It was even funnier watching level 60s come in and die to the trains. The reflection aura robots was no joke!
---
Saying cringe is cringe.
---
Yeah if there were any true SP fans from the beginning they’d agree. And I’m one of them.  This isn’t one of their best, but it’s great for the focus of content.  I’ll take my downvotes too.  Don’t care.  
---
Wow awesome. I was able to see characters far back as ‘06. This was cool
---
Sorry, hammers aren't allowed when your job is to heal the tank :\^)
---
We have Priests for that.

I think I am almost convinced to main a druid instead of a mage. So torn tho because was planning on going horde to have a difference experience but Night Elves lore and such appeal was to me way more. 
---
Hi, /u/GnomeWarlock69
---
I'm worried about playing hunter. I'm really interested in their interesting/complex autoshot timing mechanic to maximize DPS, but am also scared that everyone and their mother will be playing hunter for an "easy" level 60.
---
nah dude, we’re just trying to play the game like it was back then. If you keep adding stuff to it that was never there, then it will really change how it feels. Why would you just add all this stuff to the game? Then we wouldn’t have the original! If you want to play the updated game, play retail, or wait for BC to come out.
---
Never said they weren't worth bringing. I said few people want to put in that kind of effort to be an off-tank when they could do the same on a Warrior and top the charts. Warriors are much more popular than Druids.

Removed!
---
You know that a lot of newcomers and casual do actually care about making the 'right' choice for class/spec/race/whatever right? There are always a ton of questions regarding what to choose and it's not the experienced min/maxers that are asking them.
---
There's nothing wrong with playing however you want, but if someone is asking for the 'best' choice then they should be answered where possible.
---
There will also naturally be people looking to group with other min/maxers, generally group dynamics in WoW tend to be a lot more stable when everyone is putting in similar amounts of effort (outside of guild leadership). As such people tend to naturally filter into groups that have similar playstyles to them.
---
And as restro don't be surprised people complaining about your numbers. But remember let them know about your over heal numbers... Which will be result of other healers heal sniping.
---
Honestly restro druids are important for raids imo
---
So the first listed date of 60 is when I reached that level? Holy, didn't remember taking 5 months to reach max
---
Oh yeah, I know they’re all trolling me, or at least they’re morons. Can’t wait for Classic to be more popular that retail. Just a matter of time now 😊
---
Can’t wait for them all to complain about this and that, and I’ll say the same thing to them again: no changes! Just give us Vanilla and leave us alone.
---
Hey All!
---
I'm looking for a guild that can accomdate my weird times. I teach in China so I work sunday through thursday from 5pm PST to around 3:30am PST. When I move back to the US for grad school (maybe in a year and a half or so), times will be more flexible. Planning on running hunter, but MIGHT be persuaded to pick what the guild needs.
---
What I'm looking for:
---
Region: Any, but preferably US for ping times when I'm back
---
Server type: any but prefer PvP
---
Guild type: casual progression (not hardcore, but is organized and wants to clear naxx one day through the power of memes and friendship). Also want to do PvP as well as PvE
---
I know the times may be restricting, but honestly if it's just a US guild that raids on weekends and gives me enough time to sleep the day before work, that's all I'll need. Especially in the first year or so of progression until I'm back.
---
Other than that, I'm chill, laid back, and responsible. I can also be the guilds go to off-peak-hour farmer!
---
Don't forget mafa TD! I forgot about run kitty run, brings back memories. So many others... Here's a list for a walk down memory lane!

---
"pretty much top dog" No, they **were** the top dog , Righteous Might was the only other half decent Horde guild and when Broderick Abandon ship they lost a lot of their other raiders Feldhake couldn't recruit any of the serious players as Impervious always over shadowed them. And The Cabal/Original Gangsterz and Gentlemen  Club couldn't keep up in the slightest after AQ.
---
Announce product a year to 6 months. Put out trailer. Wait 1-2 months before release and start releasing teasers on relevant forms of media.
---
This is how every entertainment company does shit now.
---
Sounds just like what I am looking for. Unfortunately, I am Horde and NA. All the best to you!!!
---
I think the witless weirdo demographic began to shift toward human warrior with the onset of the N*st*lrius era.
---
The details of each zone wasn’t. Crestfall and Boralus was really all we know and conceptually Kul Tiras did not look like the Iron Islands like it does today or 18th century Britain. It was a human Kingdom like Stormwind on an island. Specifically Tortollans or any retail inventions. If you don’t like that, you don’t have to play, but we’re playing alongside the rules of what existed in Vanilla lore including the at the time canon RPG books, and Warcraft 3, any other material too. 
---
It’s a raw and official experience. 
---
Shout out to Rubix the original WoW druid.
---
&gt;It's not like people insist on it, it's just in the general culture of the game now, and a lot of people don't like that.
---
I tend to be more of a "you do you" person, it's not like you're forced to play with specific people, find the group that works for you and who cares what others are doing.
---
I'm not a fan of telling people they should be playing the game another way and currently it seems like you're saying efficient groups shouldn't be selecting players that put more effort in to maximise raid performance?
---
Not a fan of that mentality on either side, let people play how they want if you don't like the prevailing mentality then make your own group.
---
I actually hope blizzard sees this and let’s you and him beta classic. 
---
Wishing you the best! 
---
It was removed in Cata actually.
---
not really. you'll just have to be on a schedule, like leveling. it'll feel slow because it is slow. the key is, don't stop, it's not about speed.
---
Look, all I want to say about that is that if you're gonna be a ret pally then people won't like you if you start sniping gear.
---
Just gotta put Chappelle show on in the background while I play lol 
---
I'd let you dps. 
---
Ya know what, I can’t wait to hear all the complaints when classic comes out. I could point out tons of facts like private servers don’t have world buff cooldowns, or dynamic spawn rates on nodes, or even the private server community is a very different beast then the soon to be classic community.....but just wait and see. Let me know when you clear naxx 
---
Kargoz had a stream on duo leveling combos. Made a very solid case for why prot paladin reflect stacking with a warlock might be the fastest leveling combo in game.
---
If you are interested in playing one I would seriously check it out.
---
&lt;3
---
I personally wasn't a fan of the button layout and wanted a wired one, but it is definitely solid. 
---
not familiar woth him can you link video
---
That's a fear I can't wait to experience again. 
---
Even the literal class designer of Vanilla Kevin Jordan is against changing things in Classic, even for balance. And he admits that Paladin and Bear tanks were failures. He claims though that Shaman tanks were never intended to be endgame tanks. I understand your frustration, but we just want the game as close to the original as it can be, even with its warts.
---
We want exploits like wall jumping and getting to places where you can't be targetted fixed, because they were literal bugs, but balance issues are not the same. Prot is viable in PvP. I can understand that adding a taunt to Paladin would make them better in end game PvE and not affect PvP, but at this point, we just want the game how it was, and it will be cool to see people try to min/max prot paladin for endgame content and see how they do. That's emergent gameplay that is fun for a lot of people.
---
Maybe we can get Classic 2.0 next summer, but just give us Vanilla for now and see how things go. But yeah, if you want to be an endgame tank, your options are very limited, and that's just how Vanilla was, and so that's what the community wants. We just want to play the damn game, stop trying to fix it.
---
Paladins are priests in denial tbh
---
lolwhat

There are many sounds that bring haunting memories and flashbacks for any STV veteran. The *"pchoo"* of a curse or SW:P. The *"chrk*" of an applied hunters mark, trust me, you hear it before you see it, at least I do. And of course, *that* sound, the one sound that, when you hear it, you freeze. Your adrenaline starts pumping, flight or flight kicks in. You start sweating and your hands start shaking. I am, of course, referring to the *"Fwo^o^^o*" of Stealth.
---
Tree tag, SoL's open rpg, Blue TD, LoaP. Can't wait!
---
In this world I guess.  I come from every other RPG where Paladins weren't some shitty Cleric substitute. 
---
Fishing is optimal if you are still level 30-50 by the middle of week 2. Making 100g/h fishing may be a reality for a 2-3 day window, depending on the amount of no life MC raiders.
---
Leveling cooking on the other hand, outside of powerleveling, is a great idea. 
---
Hes also the person who says no developer wants to just recreate someone elses work. This is a second iteration of an old game and itll live and grow sooner or later. We dont want it to grow into retail, of course, but it seems folly to say itll be static for long.
---
Time will tell, of course.
---
I've been a horde lifer but same I love the darn dwarves. Gonna have to main one even though I don't like the alliance very much
---
No class can solo any equal level 5 man. 
---
Tank gear, Fury gear, FRgear, AR gear, and PvP gear (usually just Fury with a 2hander, but some added Stamina helps, this gear is also better for farming), AoE Tank gear (Force Reactive Disk x2 and a few other pieces). 
---
That sounds right. Drawing a blank on where the next region is.
---
Give us vanilla first, and see what happens. Then make further changes optional later.
---
People can still play the original Starcraft. Some may think there should be changes, but most just want to be able to play the game. WoW is such a complicated game. If you change one thing, there will be an infinitude of unintended concequences. We need to focus on only the essentials like exploits.
---
And often it takes them half an hour to get back to what they were doing, versus two minutes if they'd just died. It's the ultimate foolishness.
---
If I could make one change, it would honestly be this and only this. Why the fuck can enemies shoot magic at you through trees and rocks? 
---
No dev wants to recreate work, but sometimes they need to. It was poor decision making on the part of Blizzard to ever prevent its fan base from playing the older games, and now they have to essentially repent for their sins in order for the fanbase to trust them again.
---
They are also tackling new challenges, like how to adapt the new system to the old data, it's not like they're just repainting the same picture from scratch. The people who volunteered to work on Classic WoW are motivated by their own desire to see the game come back to life, and motivated by the enthusiasm from the community.
---
No dev truly wants to do these things, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Angwe [did an AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dkyd/i_am_angwe_the_ganker_god_of_world_of_warcraft_ama/) a long time ago.  I'm sure it's been posted a thousand times already, but always a good read.
---
No, but you can /ignore, which is just as effective.
---
*Eyy, another year!* It's your **1st Cakeday** Crighten! ^(hug)
---
Monitor too wide and flat to handle the true Classic experience
---
4 words: Darkmoon Card Blue Dragon
---
Yeah Esfand has shown that even if you are getting out dpsed by the tank, if you are a big enough streamer people will carry you through raids. 
---
No dev truly wants to do these things, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. The vanilla wow community, and the BC and WotLK communities truly appreciate their sacrifice and work, and these devs are fucking legends for doing it.
---
Hodor
---
If you're a lazy warrior you won't be topping charts either way.
---
Yeah, that's true. Better than a raid wipe, I suppose.
---
I believe it only worked with shout in vanilla and was said to be a bug and hotfixed in BC? Or maybe all three worked in vanilla but only the shout after BC fix, can't remember for sure but I read about it not too long ago. 
---
Agree. Even cleaning content in BC, we always YouTubed the boss fight. 
---
Like, our raid leader would say take 15 minutes RIGHT NOW and look at the fight 
---
https://youtu.be/t_rHqqYnh18

Summoning 37 people takes more shards than most locks would carry and on top of that would take a looong time. Did you ever try a massive hearth repair and summon in Vanilla? I don’t think it was ever done. 
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** solmyrgarde! ^(hug)
---
I really hope you don't quit your day job
---
boom! still got it!
---
Yes, guys! Don't have wrong fun! Make sure you play my way. You have fun being good at the game and going fast? Fuck you! Going slow is the only way to play.
---
The game will be running on a modern engine, so the elevators are unlikely to glitch.
---
Have you ever actually played on a pvp server?
---
They are without a doubt opposing each other.  They're fighting small skirmishes over WSG and in Arathi Basin and there are entire armies vying for control of Alterac valley.  If I remember Nethergard keep is regularly raided by Horde.  Large groups often attempt to take the life of Thrall and Bolvar.
---
Members of the alliance kill horde on sight in their cities and the horde do the same to the alliance.  Stormwind guards don't have any problem killing Grok even if he is wearing an Argent Dawn tabard.
---
It boggles my mind that you don't see the blatant hostility between the factions.
---
&gt;just doesn’t require any skill or differentiation of skilled players v newbs
---
Downranking, balancing the five second rule, and not overhealing are all ways to tell a skilled priest from a newb. 
---
&gt;I want to top healing meters.
---
Very rarely is the top healing person on the meters the actual best healer. If you check overhealing you will often see the same people at the top. As a healer your job is to keep people alive, nothing more and nothing less. You could be bottom of the healing meter and still be the reason your guild didn't wipe. Shields, purify, etc. If you want to top meters go dps.
---
&gt;general consensus is seems to be a priest is the best healer in Vanilla and the healing standard.
---
Best raid healer and the only real MT healer option on the horde side.
---
Druids need all of those sets, plus a healing set, and ideally they would also have a hybrid set (to allow them to tank and then heal when not tanking - Dungeon 2 is really good for this). 
---
Yes, as someone who doesn't enjoy rts games, this is a great method to get caught up on wc3 lore.
---
Who heals like a hoss and hits like a clown, bubbalo bubbalo bubbalobrown
---
What? I never said anything about anyone being lazy. I'm explaining why the class is not popular. Your average person wants to be on top of the damage meters and/or the main tank. That's not what Druids do and it's why they're not popular.
---
You were saying?
---
https://youtu.be/iN7XK8gE0R4
---
what kind of shit tier uber rating do you have that you only make 4$ per call? I get that in a tip most times on top of the 10-15$ I get for the rides, and I average 2 or 3 an hour.
---
All the best! And don't neither of you give up. Terminal can be beaten. 
---
Honestly, this man talks a lot of sense.
---
&gt;even considering sharding cities 
---
What? They've always said specifically that they *wouldn't* shard anything more then the starting zones.
---
And here also?
---
https://youtu.be/s8gFmVWcD3s
---
Well.  I \*do\* happen to have a campaign all ready for Vanilla Alliance.  Is Warcraft Heroes Handbook a 5e adaptation?
---
Would you guys consider maybe trying Pathfinder?
---
Feral Druids get 3% crit increase for entire group. Put one of them with the assassination rogues group!
---
Idk. They both suffer from zero run speed boost from 1-40. 
---
We're really open to anything so we would be down for Pathfinder, we just really want a lore heavy Vanilla experience before Vanilla actually comes out.
---
To clarify there are four of us, so just enough for a dungeon group! 
---
They can do that while you have fun with your stank-dick futa Night Elves and disgusting midgets. ;)
---
I suspect most healers will be Priest.
---
You will be more unique as a shaman and will work well alongside priest healers.
---
Like a dream.  DM me a Discord invite
---
I just got a Soundblaster Z and ordered 2 Used Bose Companion 3 Subwoofers. Having two subwoofers is absolutely game changing as I can now feel every spell and attack.
---
If you don't have a sub yet, I definitely recommend at least one as Vanilla WoW is a surprisingly bassy game.
---
Doesn't really look like a problem to me honestly. You said yourself that you love chain healing/totems and that's literally all the shaman does in vanilla, so why would you ditch what you love for something else? Priests are amazing healers and tops the meter but what if you don't enjoy the class itself? Will topping meters be enough for you to stay interested? You will raid a few hours every session maybe 3 days a week if you're hardcore, so will you enjoy playing priest when you're not raiding? For me the choice is pretty obvious.
---
Race matters only if you care about min-maxxing to the fullest. But since you talked about topping meters and all that then yeah, troll.
---
I think 40s was searing gorge? And then that moved you into burning steppes, I believe which was 50s.
---
You think there will be more priests than Shaman? Seriously?
---
More Holy priest than Resto Shaman.
---
Tryhard isn't really a literal statement like that. 
---
I was thinking the same thing! I didn’t know how amazing dwarf racial is - it’s great for dueling against other rogues too due to removal of poisons (including BLIND!) - I’d say it’s on par with the orc stun resist racial
---
Just all around, dwarves seem to have a great mix of racials for a rogue - I guess people didn’t really play them because dwarves don’t seem like the stealthy kind and their base stats seem to be anti-rogue (low agility compared to other 3 races), but I’m excited to play a dwarf rogue when Classic comes out. Even though that’s a class I least want to play because I mained it in Vanilla, I feel like I’m gonna see a whole new side of that class as a dwarf ☺️
---
P.S. really surprised you didn’t like Death Knights - I loved playing one. I fell in love with their death grip ability as soon as I started playing them.
---
I mean, come on. This one was obvious.
---
I'm gonna do a fitness game. I'm going ret pally and everytime someone asks me to go holy, I'll do 10 pushups. My triceps and chest will be huge, bro.
---
Seriously!? 
---
I imagined it would be the opposite. If resto shamans will be more scarce, that means I’ll be more sought after.
---
All the time my man. Men would roleplay as woman to get free gifts. I once wandered into Moonguard and saw some shit.
---
I think being a healer is going to make you sought after in general.
---
On a private server, there are a crazy number of mages. I see them everywhere but no warlocks.
---
When I raided back in the day I never had to farm for consumables once. I think classic will be a good challenge more so because of getting 40 people together and performing a task as a unit.
---
It will be fun and all the people trying to bash it sound like baby boomers telling millennials what a rude awakening life is. Life is what you make it. They just sound like a bitter old douchebag. 
---
Safe zones: starter zones, faction cities.  If you’re pvp-disabled and in one of the safe areas for 5-min you can’t be attacked. Anywhere else and you are auto flagged for pvp, cannot disable. 
---
Can’t attack same faction.  Except gurubashi arean and dire maul arena(?).
---
You don’t get loot in wpvp.  BGs can drop some silver and other stuff.
---
A level 1 can attack a 60, if the 60 is flagged. Anywhere. A 60 can stack a level 1 if 1 is flagged, anywhere.
---
You mean the current leadership? Sylvanas is cooler than Anduin, but she's also a lunatic.
---
Varian was cooler than Garrosh/Vol'jin, though.
---
"before you get access to thunderfury the threat bonus from weapon skill doesn't outweigh the added survivability."  
---
Just no. The sword skill is very very valuable during progression. It is not really a slight threat hit. It means you need to wear an extra \~3 hit in order to have the same hit as a human, never mind the other benefits of weapon skill. So you have to wear more hit gear as Night Elf and it really just makes the dodge irrelevant. 
---
Yeah the only handful of raids we ever did with Onyxia type buffs on lots of peopel were when MC was on farm for eons... no one wanted to run it anymore - not for months precious. But we were having to run recruits through MC and BWL to gear them for AQ to it was amazing to be able to speed those slogs up.
---
That's what I planned to do too, glad I won't be the only one
---
&gt;do u get loot from player
---
No. Players drop no loot. 
---
&gt;is there a range of levels like +/- 5 of ur current level is what u can and can't attack
---
No, if someone is flagged for PvP they can be attacked by anyone. You're automatically flagged for PvP on PvP servers outside of starting zones and capital cities. There's a 5 minute cooldown on flagging too, so if you flag for PvP, you'll stay flagged for 5 minutes at least if you try and turn it off. If you enter an enemy starting zone, you'll be auto-flagged so long as you remain there. 
---
&gt;Is it faction based like if im horde i cant attack horde.
---
Yes, faction based. You can only attack your own faction in the Gurubashi Arena in Stranglethorn Vale, which is a tiny section of the map. 
---
&gt;Is there places where u are safe from people or can u be strolling in a town and get murked before u open the door to the bank
---
Like I said, faction capital cities are safe territory. However, if you enter them flagged, you'll stay flagged for PvP for the next 5 minutes after you enter. Buffing or healing a player who is flagged will flag you as well. So you're only safe in a friendly zone if you wait at least 5 minutes there, not engaging in PvP or buffing/healing flagged players. Out in regular towns in the open world, outside of starting zones, you're fair game. 
---
You can only attack the opposite faction, and they must be “flagged for pvp”.
---
The are 3 types of zones: horde, alliance, and contested. 
---
Horde and Alliance zones are pretty much just the starting areas.
---
You will be flagged upon entering contested or enemy territories, or by engaging enemy players, or by aiding friendly players (healing, cleansing, etc).
---
So, you can’t just go to the enemy starting zones and start blasting lowbies.
---
The only way to fight members of your own faction is dueling, which they must agree to.
---
I think I covered everything, hopes this helps.
---
Lok’Tar Ogar!
---
Doesn't matter you only talk to them like three times. I think thrall had the most quests.
---
I found the name of my original guild (that I created before I started raiding) based on that site. I'm going to so use that as my leveling guild.
---
I think the Classic community should just start advocating for the removal of anything that's not a Warrior, Rogue, or caster. That's essentially what people seem to want anyway. If most raids will not take specs or classes that suck, why not just suggest that Blizzard makes it so you can't select that spec or class for Classic? That would make the most sense it seems.
---
Holy priest. Dwarves can't be shamans in vanilla.
---
They're all good memes, Bront.
---
Horde bro! 
---
I have zero interest in playing alliance.
---
One of the few good things BFA did for me was make me appreciate trolls (normal ones not zandalari tho theyre cool too) and now i think i want to play troll in classic
---
I hate the glitch that makes my computer clock run fast when playing the game.
---
i wish i never noticed the heel toenail on troll males. cannot unsee
---
Thank you! That sounds like the path I ran for sure. 
---
thats definitely one of the biggest downsides for me too
---
I’m sure you know this but you guys had 3-4 NA raid guilds coordinating how to best storm brm. 
---
Our MT was once held hostage in mind controls. 
---
Gearing a priest wont be as hard as you think. You're really only rolling against other priest for your gear (other than accessories/trinkets those you will compete with all healers). You wont compete with mage/lock because healing cloth and dps cloth are separate. Also priest usually goes for tier gear so you're only competing with other priests in that regard. Also priest gear is diff from resto sham gear since priest go for spirit, and resto sham goes for mp5. You will compete a bit with druids. Honestly I think its about tied between sham and priest for gearing.

Both are sought after in raids. There might be a couple more shamans than priests though. And both can top the meter. Healing meters are kinda wonky anyway since its basically whoever is overhealing the most gets the most attention. Which good players know doesn't mean shit. But the average player that hasn't dabbled in healing doesn't understand. 
---
All in all id say they are really tied. With priest pulling slightly ahead in regards to gearing and single target healing. So really its a question of thematically what would you rather be playing. Casting holy heals vs nature heals, shadow damage vs elemental damage, staff vs 1h and shield, etc.
---
Also I agree on troll for a pve perspective. Unless you just cant stand them aesthetically. 
---
I’m biased towards shaman, but play what’cha want
---
However, if we’re talking pve, trolls the best race for horde either way, imo 
---
I hate what you are going through. I hope your adventures in retail are as awesome as your relationship with your dad. Also if you fear classic won’t be out in time please don’t hesitate to join a private server because vanilla is still magical even if it’s not on an official server and time with your dad is precious now. 
---
This has been a great explaination.
---
I get it, just don't know how to make a horse dwarf priest. Might have to open a ticket with blizzard. GL on your dwarf priest journey 
---
Friend refuses to play alliance with me and even if I went horde he says he’s not gonna play the game for long.
---
You forgot the /s I think
---
It's insane how easy it is to make groups as a warrior, even if you're a fury all you need is to keep a shield and tank set in your bag.
---
Ew rp 
---
😂 
---
I'd say do both together after hitting 60 but if you don't mind losing 5-10 hours then you can definitely do it while you level. That stam buff is always good to have!
---
If you play shaman you probably don’t have friends anyway
---
Unlike in retail, you wont be declined PURELY because of your class.
---
Retail can be cancerous, especially m+ and im not even talking high levels, 8-12 and if you're not playing meta specs, you'll get declined 19/20 times.
---
In vanilla, every single class / spec brings something to the group and people arent such anal about it. Its gonna be a culture shock for people who havent played it before and probably for the better.
---
People are way more social, helpful and accepting compared to retail.

It's a tragedy when something is hideous in form and function. An LCD display... on your keyboard... that shows you in-game stats from the in-game HUD. On the keyboard.

Top brain stuff right there.
---
Charging up a hill only to find yourself falling through the world. It was in vanilla. Not sure if it will be in classic
---
I didn’t realize Druids could use shields or Goblin Sapper Charges. 
---
The trolling I fell for was: "cata will re-do the old world and it will be awesome"
---
But..... Dwarf is master race
---
You stand in the front, don't heal and hit like a wet noodle then?
---
TIL 26% of this sun thinks a child is cooler than a WARCHIEF!!!
---
I’d love to! I only have experience in Vanilla and WOTLK. What time zone and faction? If you already know? 
---
You played on a PvE server? Type /pvp, that’s what a PvP server is like. 
---
No its more of a pillow, but sometimes its like a really heavy pillow.
---
if they have armor % buffs on them from a shaman/priest, stoneshield, ARENT dual-wield tanking, and ARENT using dps pieces so that they can actually hold threat, and have other armor consumes, then yeah, they can get armor cap once they get like 95% of all bis gear
---
however, current meta means theyre not even getting close
---
Agreed, there will be plenty of room for 4-5 warlocks in 40mans. Warlocks provide great utility and their curses are great for mages and melee.
---
other healers feel entited because resto druids are the worst healers on basically every fight except for saphirron

i cant wait to make my favorite vanilla class, worgen death night!

Unless you swing upwards, I'd reckon it'll get you farther from the ground. /r/technicallythetruth
---
Look at me the the bloody hipster. Had to decide between troll and gnome.
---
1) priests are always wanted in raids
---
2) shamans cannot top meters unless your guilds healers are useless because chain heal makes them put out the same exact hps on every fight
---
3) there is zero skill in chain healing for 3 years until you kill kt
---
4) why would mages or warlocks be rolling on healing gear
---
play a priest

As  someone who PvPed extensively as a hunter on a famous private server, I've never had a problem against Feral druids. Firstly,  Feral druids simply didn't do enough damage to kill me, since I was a  mail wearer with higher health. I could stand there and tank them for  quite a while, and I could melee them pretty well too since my Raptor  Strike could crit for 1k. Forcing druids to shift drains their mana, and  there's nothing they can do against me just trapping them and getting  distance. Once I'm out of  range of Feral Charge and they're in range of  Concussive Shot (druids can't shift out of dazes), it's impossible for  them to ever reach me to kill me, and I can charge up Aimed Shot if they  run away while slowed. I didn't even need Scatter Shot or Engineering,  but if I did have them, there'd be  a world of extra options.
---
Don't try to rush level 60 on classic. Most of the fun is in the levelling. If you want to get the most out of classic, max out every skill and rep you can while levelling.
---
I wish the best for you and your father, I hope you get a chance with him to experience classic with him too, we're all hoping it's soon :)

What did you play in vanilla and what will you play?

Rfk 2hander is level 29. Getting it or before 30 is tough, as the dungeon isn’t easily doable at that level. On a fresh server my friends and I farmed first boss for the axe for both my paladin and my friends warrior. We were all 28 at the time, and couldn’t do much more than first boss with level difference. 
---
I feel like I spent an excessive amount of money not just on repairs and skills but on freakin' flight paths. That shit added up quick. 
---
Dont play human for the spirit bonus.  Its inconsequential.  The rep bonus is where its at
---
I'm definitely interested in hearing more information about this, and am potentially interested in being involved. Sounds like a lot of fun.
---
ive played most of everything on various privates over time. my second longest raiding stint was with a resto shaman 
---
/e has reported you afk. Type /afk protest to not be removed from the battleground.

Unnecessary though.

Dota! The birth of an entire game genre. Great game

Defender of the Timbermaw trinket. Needing exalted with timbermaw, which took forever and most people wouldn’t do. Surprising people with it in pvp was fun. The trinket summons a 400-500ish hp furbolg that will cast one healing wave on you for 500ish before starting to machine gun out lightning bolts for 300 damage a hit. 
---
Would it not be good to have a moonkin groups with some mages for the 3% spell crit aura?
---
Downvote me
---
Do you have a link to any place they've "said specifically that they *wouldn't* shard anything more than the starting zones"?
---
Human Priests are actually better in endgame since Nax bosses don't fear. 
---
You're ignoring the concept of "contested territory" (probably 75% of all areas) the phrasing implies that there is an ongoing war for dominance in those territories. Needless killing fits right in with that. "Sending a message" if you will, "Desolace is ours. Tell your friends they'll only get hurt if they come here."
---
Aaw I'm surprised trolls are so low. I play Alliance but if I ever did roll Horde I'd be a troll no question. They have cool accents and awesome hair, what's not to love!?
---
Real talk if I was a rogue I'd just stealth around people to freak them out but then not actually do anything.  Or just keep doing it.
---
Oh man, my dad had to buy some stupid fats PC in 05 for work. I went from D/c in Stormwind lol....to 30 frames in Ironforge. It was NUUUUUUUUUTS

Not strictly WoW related but someone once told me to alt F4 and it worked. So embarrassing, even today.
---
All those facts about p servers are common knowledge. None of which change the bottom line. The game is easy, just a giant time sink. 
---
This notion people seem to have that classic wow will be so vastly different compared to recent p servers, so much so that the gameplay will be incredibly more difficult is just asinine. 
---
The game is old. The knowledge we have now compared to 2004 is ridiculous. The ability to min / max has reduced the difficulty of the game tremendously. On top of the fact of knowledge of all boss encounters, Addons and just general knowledge about the game. 
---
I’m not suggesting casual scrubs and there moms will be clearing naxx. But you’re ignorant to think any guild of decent players, and I use decent lightly, (ie don’t stand in fire) will be incapable of clearing through all content. 
---
The toughest thing about raiding in classic wow is still and always will be getting 40 individual people online at any one time with one goal in mind and executing it. 
---
Now if you want to continue on about there being stupid people who won’t clear certain raids then by all means. There will always be those at the bottom and those at the top. But in this day and age even middle of the pack players should be clearing content. 
---
Alliance! I gotta have salvation on my warlock
---
When a Mage makes a summoning macro that matches the warlocks who are also summoning, except the Mage casts a Portal and you just mindlessly click it.
---
Melee mage has more cc and mobility than that, FACTS. 
---
You're just being ridiculous. Obviously they don't use shields. But they still benefit from gear swaps in situations where multi-target threat is more important than mitigation, just like Warriors.
---
Like without even putting bias into this one the answer should be incredibly easy.  
---
Love the idea of them, but the hunchback and the silly feet that you can never cover up...I'll pass.
---
You think only 8-9 guilds per faction will be raiding and only one raid per week per server? Seems low for me
---
You are ignoring my comment asking for how you make your judgements, want to have a real conversation and not you using subjective statements like "ghost wolf makes you faster therefore they have viable pvp mobility".
---
Warlocks have spells directly tied to their melee attack, that proves melee spec warlocks are viable?
---
Can ret paladins dps? Ah, the age old question. Here's reality. The amount of work; we're talking farming for money or mats for pots, doing your research making sure to play at peak optimal at all times, to simply hit mid teens on a raid parse is literally beyond most people. I've played with a ret Pally who was AMAZING back in Vanilla but the amount of effort he put into it to make it work was FAR greater than anyone else's for literally sometimes, just sometimes, hitting 10th on the meter
---
They all have cool stuff, I found the shaman quests to be pretty cool.
---
Ruined immersion.  Literally unplayable.  #nochanges reeeeee.  /s
---
Should you bring the class or the player?
---
Ouch Town! Population You Bro!
---
Maybe it is obnoxious, but it's not hurting anyone unless they have tissue-thin skin.

I'd do terrible things just to have 10% of his skill tbh.  
---
You're playing against bad Druids. There are a lot of them. When the strategy is to kill your pet, then it doesn't matter if you get range. The Druid should never chase you until your pet is dead.
---
If you ever manage to get range AFTER your pet is dead, then they should hit you with Rank 1 Moonfire (to save mana; max rank for the damage if you are not currently debuffed with it) to daze you. If you don't use Cheetah, then you won't have range for very long.
---
There's better weapon tho
---
had the same the time just Flew by while i was playing no idea were it went.
---
I am really interested in this.  I would love to hear more information about it if you are still looking for people to play.  My schedule sucks though, so hopefully that won't get in the way. 
---
Point isn't to min/max
---
Pay streamers to play open beta. Pay streamers to play release week. Voila, successful marketing campaign.
---
My friend and I are switching to Horde because we want to have new quests. I'm goq Tauren Shaman because I feel they are the least "evil" of the horde races. 
---
the feet are never covered and they make all gear look busted imo. theyre ears and tusks almost always fuck up helms. theyre technically taller than taurens but they have such a huge hunchback they stand about the same height as orcs which causes them to run in such long strides that it feels like you have a 50% slow on. this last point is the main reason i never make it out of the starting zone as a troll. i always enjoy making em in character creation but thats it. 
---
lol wut?
---
the player obviously, good players don't play ret 
---
Druid, warlock, or shaman.

Close to 2 full time jobs

Meh. 70% of the population will quit after a month when they realize: no dungeon finder, no raid finder, no lfr, no fast travel, have to run to every dungeon, unbalanced classes, constant ganking by rogues, how long class weapon quest is, how boring the raids actually are (long down times and 20% of raid afk at all times), shitty trade skills, poor addon support, return of original healbot addon, no ground telegraphing, no scaling of level of mobs or with friends (you will find it hard to play with friends until level cap), 3 day long pvp games, did I say having to run to each dungeon, pvp map? There is more but I will leave the rest as a surprise to you.
---
shadowfang &gt; dumb fire horse
---
Sure but, running into someone in the opposing faction in an area that's contested and not being able to do what your character naturally would in that situation makes even less sense. Especially given the fact that resurrection spells are a genuine part of the game world with quests and everything.
---
There's also: "I choose to ignore that Orc that just ran by and made a rude gesture at me because (pretense), instead I will die attempting to kill two bears at once because one spawned on top of me."
---
This sounds like a lot of fun. If you end up with an extra slot I would love to give it ago. FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Tbh most of those wanting a social experience have been abused to the shithouse by the no changes crowd.
---
Indeed. How are they at the bottom?
---
So you let your casual friends who don't sound nearly as passionate or committed to playing pick the faction? Why? 
---
Lol it's a shame that's every other RPG.  
---
Damn 12 year olds dominating the voting polls 
---
What hunchback? they've got perfect posture. Unless you're weird and play a male troll. 
---
Hahaha. The ole switcharoo
---
Playing on a pvp server isn't that bad, most of the starting zone are too far away from the other factions so you don't encounter people from the other faction for a while. It start with stonetalon mountains and  Hillsbrad foothill around lv 20, even though it's really annoying, it reinforce the community aspect of the game even more. If you get ganked, on your way back you might meet another guy from your faction and play a while together just so you're safe. It's a really great experience until you get to stranglethorn vale, there's a reason why people refer to it as the Vietnam. I usually just skip the zone entirely even if it means i need to grind mobs for a couple of levels. After that people are usually too spread out and you have your mount so pvp is less of a problem.

Same boat here.

What type do vodka?

Underrated comment.
---
Whether you're being sarcastic or not it is.
---
The druid can't kill my pet because they would be vulnerable to me attacking them, where they would die or at least use all their mana on a NS + HT combo. They also can't kill my pet because they don't do very much damage. If I wanted to, in T1 gear, I'm pretty certain I could outheal druid damage with just Mend Pet if I wanted to.
---
I wouldn't be dazed from Moonfire if I weren't in Cheetah (which I wouldn't be if I were opening from range), and all I really need to do is use Aimed Shot once or twice to kill you. You have no way to get out of Freezing Trap, where I could just nuke you down after taking a few steps back. In good gear, I do so much damage compared to you that how quickly you regain melee range doesn't matter as long as I have almost any time past eight yards, and even then I can do okay short-term damage to you in melee.
---
swiftly followed by the crunch of cheap shot
---
&gt;Priest relies on getting the last hit to proc spirit tap which doesn't synergise that well with others
---
That's why the melee can be off pulling the next mon while the priest wands down the current one.

Each retail server will have a vanilla shard. Unsure if they’re going to allow any communication between the retail and vanilla shard, because you can all be in stormwind at the same time but not see each other obviously

No big mouse with tons of buttons for me. I just like something light, small, wireless and with perfect tracking the Logitech g305 is great and a 10-keyless mechanical keyboard.

No there´s not. In the lore, there is no war going on.

I tried an logitech g600 and it's just too big for my small hands to grip comfortably and it's just so awkward for me to hit those tiny buttons with my thumb.

Paladin/Warlock, Shaman/Warrior, or Druid/Rogue

Racials mean a lot more in PvP than in PvE.

Watchind a movie called searching, she is annoyed at how attentive i am

Hunter definitely has more of an ebb and flow kind of feel to their playstyle, weaving auto-multi combos. And when left alone being able to pick targets at range for aimedshot-multis with rapid fire and almost no worries from curse of tongues, spell pushback, they can flare themselves, prep with traps etc.
---
I just want to play it man. I hope they do a early access or beta to test out molten core that we can play. Summer of 2019 can’t come soon enough m.

Too much bad blood.

Yea sure, this shows you do not need to min max anything to kill KT.

So only need to raid 1-2 days a week usually in classic raids? I got rank 12 back in vanilla and had a lot of twinks never raided until mid wotlk

I am excited for it, i miss either it or my youth, idk which. Hopefully it allows me to have a bit of fun and maybe I can enjoy it with my boy as well

A rum and coke and then some Scotch for me, friend.  Happy Friday!

I played a bit of Overwatch and then my friend talked me into picking up Crypt of the NecroDancer, seems pretty fun so far if you like rhythm games!

I will have to try it out, thanka for the recommendation

what's this f word
---
Gnomes are my favourite but they can't be my favourite classes ... which is why I don't play one. 😭
---
There's a few differences between the two. Hunter is physical dps and mage is magic. This is actually pretty big in vanilla. Late game pallys and warriors (and even shamies/bears) have a lot of armour, meaning physical dps has a much harder time taking them down. Magic dps on the hand couldn't care less what a target's armour is, but at the same time they don't get a big bonus attacking low armour targets like mage/rogue. Magic on the hand does have to worry about resistances, the main one for mages being warlocks with felpuppy out (default for group pvp) having 60 all resist and other mages with frost ward which makes them a very hard target for a mage.
---
  
---
Another difference is hunter is really a melee/zone control class. Their main CC tools like trap/wing clip/scattershot are melee or close range abilities. There's not much they can do to targets 30 yards away except shoot - and they have no interrupt or mortal strike in vanilla so a well geared pally or priest can heal through everything you can throw at them.  
---
Mage on the hand has poly and counterspell which are super powerful 30 yard range abilities. One thing with mages is that their CC abilities like poly/nova/cs/coc/rank1 frostbolt are so strong it's not that common that "turreting" is the best option. You should often be focusing on cc'ing things and letting the warlocks/hunters/rogues/warriors do the deeps because your cc is so good.
---
Hunters get a nice trinket from ZG that resets cooldown on aimed shot, multi and arcane which is a big boost for them in pvp
---
Full quote:
---
"As you've noticed, the Classic Demo does have realm sharding. This is to let as many people as possible experience it without technical issues such as server capacity or spawn density getting in the way.
---
Longer term, we know how crucial it is to the Classic experience for you to see your friends when you walk into Stormwind or when you’re helping them on a quest you’ve already completed. And there should only ever be one Kazzak on a realm, no matter how many people are waiting for him to spawn.
---
We’re still looking at how we can best deliver an authentic Classic experience at launch, and in the weeks and months that follow - both in terms of gameplay and community. You won’t see phasing (which is tied to specific quests that don't exist in Classic) or cross-realm zones (which combine multiple realms together) in Classic. However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days. But we recognize that a cohesive world is critical to WoW Classic and are committed to bringing that to you."
---
There's nothing in there that says what you've claimed it said. If it did, you should be able to highlight the relevant line(s) undisputedly, right?
---
Damn both my faves gnome and troll are at the bottom lol
---
We're they wrong though? Maybe you could have been a rocket scientist making big money for hookers and blow
---
Druid pvp question: are they good at killing or is it more of an outlasting the opponent thing?
---
For pve, I'm really enjoying tanking but I haven't been able to pvp enough to get an idea about Druid's pvp playstyle.
---
I played SPriest in Vanilla and their pvp style is very much in your face. Jump into the fray and start melting faces.
---
Is Druid pvp playstyle more leaning towards a hit and run sniper?
---
I'm not saying "Don't play ret". I'm saying the statement "they can be just as good" is just wrong.
---
False.  
---
wtb tremor totem,
---
raid without dwarf priests
---
Thank you, 
---
I couldn't find anything for it. I figured it was false, as it would be overpowered. 
---
Your friend is wrong the game has never had Shared Racials even now in its non RPG Diablo 4 style game every race has their own Racials, Think about it logically why would Humans or Nightelves have access to " Will of the Forsaken " ? Forsaken is in the name Or Orcs having Shadowmeld?
---
why would they be talking about retail leadership?? its vanilla man
---
It's kind of like a paladin in the sense that you can outlast other characters.
---
The difference is, that druids have multiple reliable tools to share or chase and finish the kill.
---
If you get them low enough you ca burst them down with spells. Or snare them and cat form.
---
5% extra spirit, even at Naxx gear levels, is barely anything. That's like, at most, 20-25 extra spirit.
---
I wouldn't trade Fear Ward for 20 extra spirit.
---
And won't get invited to any raid group that doesn't want to be in MC for 4 hours. 
---
You can come on alt-gearing runs to gear your main :) 
---
Innervate and battle rez where the reasons you brought druids along.
---
Dude I used to play a female draenei just cause I liked that character.. But some dude just started giving me stuff and sending stuff in the mail. He must have been desperate or something but I never told him I was a dude because I was making bank and he was an idiot.
---
Do you understand how playing on a pvp server affects things like world bosses, economy, and guild relations? Because your suggestion doesn't really imitate how a rp-pvp server would work in those regards.
---
I'll still fall in it every day trying to jump across on my 60% mount
---
it's still an advantage 
---
it's a min max thing 
---
I looked plenty of world chests that people had left one piece of shitty food inside so it didn't respawn.
---
People hiding the WSG flag outside the map.
---
They're probably talking about the first sentence in the second paragraph, but you're right; they never actually said there won't be sharding in Stormwind (or any city for that matter).
---
Mother fucker, what don't you get? Sure, we can do MC and other raids with suboptimal DPS classes and specs. BUT IT WILL TAKE FOREVER. No matter HOW GOOD you are at your class, you cannot push it beyond its mathematical boundaries. And, I don't know about you, but I don't want to be in MC for fucking ten hours. The dungeon gets done faster the more damage you do. No amount of wits or knowledge can change that. What. Don't. You. Get? 
---
You can come and gear your Ret Paladin main when the rest of the people are doing alt runs. Unless you find a group that wants to sit in a 40 man raid forever. 
---
Do you hear it? Do you hear that argument? "Oh but if it's just me, it won't matter much because there are 39 other people." Man, fuck outta here with that. You're not fucking special. 
---
Oh no, but my immersion! Go play with action figures or LARP, then, for your RP experience if you want that. 
---
I mean you will be doing a lot of questing, but there is a LOT of grinding in vanilla. Good quests aren't always available and a lot of times grinding is just better xp/hr than most quests in a level range or zone.
---
Had. The internet was more innocent back then. Now everyone is suspicious of everyone.
---
Trust is gone 
---
They're not considering sharding due to technical limitations; The modern servers can handle it. It's to handle the influx of tourists that wont stick around and prevent dead servers.
---
tbh that's not happening as a warrior period.
---
The player. The person willing to play a class that doesn't slow down the raid for the rest of us. Does that make sense.
---
A good player would realize that by playing Ret, they are making the dungeons take longer. They are, de facto, wasting the other players' time :) 
---
I don't think a player who is keen on wasting other people's time is a good person. A bad person, actually. Willing to slow the pace of the game for 4 to 39 other people for the personal sake of their perverted and childish sense of immersion. Why would I want that player around?
---
Why would I want a selfish and deluded player like that? 
---
I think it just resets multi which is honestly the best of the 3 but I could be wrong?
---
Short answer: yes. Mage is better but hunter matches them pretty well in the short run, especially pre-aq.
---
Lmao that's brilliant!
---
Yeah they are not shaman, druid or hunter. 
---
The pool of classes with early speed boosts is small, it is those 3, the class shaman has the best synergy with? Warrior. The class hunters have synergy with? Solo. The class Druid has synergy with? Warlock.
---
I wouldn't say 'dreading' but accepting a summon mid-flight and falling under the world.
---
Getting 60 in 5 days, as a warrior, and with how congested Classic will inevitably be, is incredibly ambitious. You'd be fortunate to get that time even with zero competition on a warrior.
---
Level with your friend, it'll be half a day longer at the very worst but a hell of a lot more bearable.
---
Definitely worth it and imo it's not that time consuming. I'm by no means a fast leveler and I leveled a warrior from 1-60 on one of those hush hush servers + maxed mining and first aid, 255 BS, 230 Fishing and 240 cooking. Took me a total of just over 10 days played. Mostly just leveled my professions when I was afk.
---
The backdoor can be camped by like 2 hunters and a warlock shooting through the ground, it is not hard to defend. The meta changing is you admitting that at some point before those strategies were developed Alliance had a huge advantage in a straight up "honest" match that was played the way the game "intended." Alliance used to justify this by saying it was to balance out horde being better at pvp to achieve something like 50/50 wins. I always said it should have been balanced and merit based but I loved AV back in the day as a horde just for the ability to hunt people and find 1v1's. Also grouping with mages to push the bridge.
---
yea horde literally have no way of dealing with fear whatsoever, thats why im just gonna play casually in raids on my undead priest and maybe some on my alt orc shaman =)
---
Outplay and outlast. Certain match ups allow you to operate a lot more quickly, such as if you hit an opener on a rogue or warrior or mage and get their health a good chunk down. Otherwise you have to play smart against priests, shaman, and even other Druid’s. If you see a hunter or warlock you probably shouldn’t bother. If you see a Paladin, don’t bother because neither of you can kill each other.
---
I'm not really sure if this is accurate but this classic database http://classicdb.ch/?item=19953
---
says "and" so it sounds like all, and includes volley too which I didn't mention
---
A masterpiece, take my upvote
---
Feral is not a good offtank for raids mate. 
---
It's Warrior/Warrior for Vanilla. 
---
There is no excitement there, opening a loot box and not knowing what it holds is exciting.
---
anyway, what year are you living in? Ingame shops gives players options/choices which is positive thing.
---
No that is probably right, but I think the most common use was aimed - 2x multi or just 2x multi due to how hard it hit and it being near instant cast.
---
You're not getting it. It's the same now as it was then. There's nothing wrong with Ret Paladins or other objectively poor performing spec existing. But don't expect to get invited to raids in any other capacity than an alt run. You simply won't be included on a first go through of most, if any, raids unless you are buddies with the people and they agree. Which is extremely rare, by the way, but a lot of people seem to think is going to happen. It's VERY selfish to expect 4-39 other people to slow down the pace of their game just for you. Literally, that is what you are asking when you ask to be invited to a raid as a Ret Paladin. Do you understand?   
---
I hate the argument of, "Oh, we understand the game a lot better now. We've been through the content a billion times, it's a breeze." Yes, it IS a breeze. But, more importantly, yes we have done this content a billion times. So why the FUCK would we want it to take any longer than it has to? To have fun with the content no matter how long it takes? Sure. That's fine and dandy the first few times you run MC. But did you forget? Did you fucking forget? How MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FUCKING RAID? Holy SHIT is it taxing on the soul after a while. And it's the same for BWL, ZG, AQ, etc, afterward. How LONG you have to be in the SAME SHIT for a tiny amount of loot to spread among 40 fucking people. Can I bring my Ret Pally? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Is the answer you are going to get just a few weeks into MC, when the thing has become a grind.  
---
Do you understand? 
---
sounds about right, either way this thing is nuts lol. they can delete clothies with that
---
Clearly it was just an example of mine and I don‘t hate any class or race ingame. I just prefer things. If you love the idea of having a fearward and love dwarves go play one. Thats not min/maxing, thats more of a dedication thing. 
---
Literally a pom-pyro for hunters that nobody talks about.
---
it still works. I made a female nelf on a p word server and people gave me a couple gold which helped when I was a low level. I doubt anyone would give a lot of gold though it was more of a joke 
---
You're incredibly wrong
---
Druids have quests and lore for their forms. 
---
Shamans dito but for totems. 
---
Rogues got extra for some of their skills, lockpick and pick-pocketing. And they have that whole Ravenholdt area that went nowhere. 
---
Warlocks have cool stuff, loads of lore for when they get new demons.  
---
Mages got... not much. Remember some class-q at 50 but nothing spectacular. 
---
Warr? Go to dance school for stances? Dunno
---
Palas? Feels like there could be loads of lore and q’s but got no clue. 
---
Hunters? Got an awesome epic quest at 60 but dunno lvling
---
Priest. Some lore reg Light/Shadow while lvling
---
Well yeah, I agree with you. That's why I think it'd be beneficial for Classic to have the community voice their opinion that certain specs should be removed from the game. That way no one can play them and impede other people's enjoyment of Classic.
---
We're in full agreement.
---
What? Has this been confirmed? Source?
---
Not so. You can still be a nuisance and rank 1 Moonfire would-be flag capturers, and there's no issue with disengaging and stealthing to perhaps restart the fight on your terms, wait until reinforcements arrive, or go be more productive at another location.

---

---
You're the reason they would launch with a short window. To make it so not everyone can roll right away and stagger people.
---
Well, that's a really stupid take. These classes are fine to exist. I might even play Ret, actually. I like the playstyle. But I'm totally cool playing healer until my guild does alt-runs and I can go Ret. 
---
The fearward debate is getting outta hand :-). Horde has neither but still cleares all content. And it is a min/maxing thing if you choose to play a dwarf just for his fearward when they have no other intrinsic value like lore/outer appearance and whatsoever for you.
---
My main post was about anxious uncertain people who thought they won’t get a raidpost if they choose a NE priest to play what‘s clearly not the case that‘s where I am coming from.
---
I firsy played in wrath when i was around 4 i think, played on my brothers laptop. Made a gnome warlock. I just ran around killing mobs, but i still found it fun.
---

---
Battle bucket for poop
---
oh god, quit crying. you can play your shitty spec in any other content in the game. if your main interest is in raiding, then it might behoove you to play something that isn't balls awful in that setting, what with the mountain of information you have available to you. I wouldn't mind them buffing these garbage specs, but that's not going to happen and it would be grating since derpy ret pallies have been the most played spec in retail wow for, oh, about a decade now. could use the break.
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
I see your sarcasm and I had to laugh. 
---
It’s using the modern engine, so it’s going to run really well on modern systems considering the low poly count and texture resolutions. Might be worth getting a 144 hz screen if you don’t already have one. For that ultra smooth experience.
---
Innervate isn’t about mana, it’s about a morale boost. When other players get innervate, or when they see shaman or priests getting innervated, they get pumped and feel like things are going good.
---
I innervated myself pretty rarely, I just don’t think it’s the Druid’s true role.
---
And our messiah Bijou Heist.
---
The foliage pop-in in Vanilla was pretty awful. Glad to see that was not the case in the demo.
---
Once you are 60 it becomes okay with the right spec. You can move from ambush - ks - bs - gauge - bs to the next guy. Never as fast as with swords if you want to kill multiple things fast though.
---
You can still use swords as a dagger rogue for Sinister Strike Spam. Eviscerate also does not care about your weapon. You should have little trouble. Combat would be better obviously, but dagger will not be terrible.
---
Have fun mate! You will get your spot I am pretty sure :-)
---
I mean, this is the classic wow subreddit, do you really think they mean current retail?
---
Seal fate daggers with raid gear is a fun and decent mob grinding spec. You can kill a lot of things just with one round of cs -&gt; ks and take virtually no damage. Definitely not as powerful as combat swords bladeflurry/adren rush things but good enough.
---
well, thats something i havent thought about yet. the pve spec doesnt differ that much. i can just swap to sword. the only thing i would muss is sword specialisation.
---
I don’t see why we should expect any of the old glitches to return. Maybe new glitches or glitches in new places. One of the most annoying I remember were underground dragonlings in Redridge. They did huge damage and you couldn’t see them or fight back since they were stuck below terrain.
---
Awesome work dude!
---
It's a shame we didn't even get some of those Pornhub links! 
---
Tbf 10 hours a day is still going to take most people almost a month to 60 
---
I’m going to so cooking and fishing while leveling. It’ll probably take a long time for me to hit max, although I will probably play at least 2 hours a day on average. I won’t really have the option of playing insane hardcore sessions of 8+ hours.
---
So if you’re not going all out you’d be doing awful dmg and the case for you getting any gear at all is in weak at best. 
---
I’m sorry a retribution paladin kicked your cat, it’ll be okay. 
---
Clearly OP wants ALL the raid spots for himself by trying to trick people into playing subpar combos! 
---
Get well!
---
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

I loved killing trolls as Alliance. Felt so bad killing Tauren though. 
---
Whaaaaaat??
---
This was my signature move in AV... now I'm gonna say "click for healthstones" to see who doesn't realise that's not in vanilla.
---
I had the same laptop from late vanilla to beginning of Cata. I remember if I saw more than 20 people on my screen I couldn't play. WotLK Dalaran....before sharding? Oh boy, I had my hearth there on my 73 orc dk and to run from the horde inn to the horde portals (literally passed a set of stairs and a fountain) took about 6-8 minutes. 
---
I still have my Logitech Z-5500s. When crusader proc’d oh man I could listen to that all day. 
---
I put my foot down. A lot of my friends wanted to go Horde, but none are as dedicated or planning far ahead as i am. They're all going to roll alliance with me, but I think it's for the best. If I'm having a blast, i think it will rub off on them (as it does usually).   
---
I think Classic is far too long of an investment for you to NOT play what you truly want to play. The plus side will be that you'll meet new people. If others carry the same values we will end up with servers where people want to play as a community and not in close knit clicks.   
---
If my friends end up quitting, I am looking forward to meeting new people to dungeon/raid with!!
---
Tbf I make that mistake all the time, I often don't check which subreddit the post was made in and just make an ass of myself. 
---
I actually quit for the Second time during Wrath specifically because of dailies.
---
I would do them for 5 hours a day and still be a poor warrior. I thought to myself “I have a job IRL, why the hell am I grinding E-Money? Job simulator = no fun”
---
My old bones ache. 
---
Even on private servers, few guilds are able to do Naxx. Hamsterwheel managed to get into a Naxx guild recently. I recommend his video as it goes into some detail on what it takes.
---
But if you have been in a top 10 US guild, can find a hardcore raid guild in Classic and are willing to put in the time, the only thing stopping you from eventually killing KT would be psychological factors like burnout.
---
Found the warrior main 
---
I actually started wow classic with friends on the alliance side, but as time went on and we went to different colleges my other friend didn’t play so much and I switched to horde blood elf.
---
I actually found my friend playing in STV near the booty bay entrance and following him for ages and then logged into my ally char and said “did u like that blood elf”
---
He thought I was a traitor.
---
Now classic is on its way back, I am converting back to the alliance. I can’t wait to walk into stormwind again. And Goldshire, oh wow Goldshire...
---
Unarmored Epic mounts? Will dungeon solo runs be nerfed? What about population caps? ^(Release date pretty please?)
---
Well done sir.

Oh man, this is excellent work, have my upvote good sir.

You and me both. My main will be gnome warrior, my alt will be Troll Shadow Priest.
---
don't post a post-weekend post
---
&gt;  For every inclusion of a Ret Paladin, the time inside the instance increases. This is a hard fact that no one can argue.
---
Ive seen plenty of raids with fewer than 40 people so if you're Fielding 32 players for a raid, adding a 300 DPS ret would literally only add damage and decrease the time to kill. The only downside would be it's 1 more person to heal which isn't that big of a deal.
---
Thanks °w°
---
Are you trolling?  That will literally be the 3 least needed classes.
---
oh
---
Feral is a good offtank. Search this sub - there are a number of posts showing how and why it works.
---
Alternatively search for Taladril or Skarmbrena. 
---
Saved
---
You will need 3 prot tanks to start and 3 more with a good tank set to get through MC early. I always love to bring at least 1 good feral for this reason. It let's you cut down to 2 prot warriors and a feral tank does more dps in cat than a prot warrior w a 2hander any day, also Brez, innervate. 
---
Getting tricked into joining a party for a dungeon and accepting a summon, but getting summoned to the Gurubashi Arena and killed.

That's not a vanilla mentality. It's the post-BC development mentally that led to class hemogeny and ability pruning.

You got it man I wanna fill all 40 spots in a raid by myself that‘s my ultimate goal!
---
This is a great way of looking at it. You're totally right that it feels great when a druid innervates you.
---
Came here to say this
---
Only to realize that you are still too impatient and won't do any of that! ;)
---
God damn this is some good shit!
---
A game that requires more time than a job.
---
There will be white knighting of ret paladins on reddit even after Classic launch. Don't think you'll ever be able to change that. The in-game reaction to ret paladins in raids will be an entirely different one as it *always* has been. The only way around that is to be a 'famous' streamer *cough* esfand *cough.*
---
Thanks! Good luck finding a guild!
---
Can't wait to either start or join a guild that's not anal about world buffs and consumables 24/7.
---
That's what the player base has been saying for years. But this was a statement from Ion Hazzikostas alone not from the Classic WoW dev team. I'm pretty sure they are aware of the demand for RpPvP servers. After all, they have proven themselves to listen to the community.
---
The way it will work for most guilds is, 
---
Phase 1 will be one raid night with ony on reset. 
---
In Phase 3, bwl progression one night and leftover bwl + mc on a second night. Maybe a third night during progression until you get bwl on farm (one or two weeks max for a decent guild), and then back to one night when bwl and mc can be cleared in time. Ony still on reset. 
---
Phase 4 you'll run zg on off nights or on one of your raid nights depending on reset. 
---
Phase 5 will probably drop ony and mc clears except maybe Baron runs for bindings or alts and ony for the head buff if it doesn't have a cool down.  Otherwise same schedule as phase 3, just substitute in bwl and aq. Aq20 is usually just pugged or off night activity. Zg is still run for hearts. 
---
Then phase 6 will be three night raiding during progression. You'll still run aq40 when you can but by that point it's mostly all in on naxx. 
---
This will not apply to super hardcore or super casual guilds, but is close to what everyone in between will do. 
---
And how many people even stepped into Naxx?
---
Don't make me log on to my main
---
Kill the booty bay flightmaster around raidtime.

This is true but name a single decent female troll char

Can't wait to see that one guy who rolled a Troll Mage with Mining/Herbalism.

Judging by some of the recent dev activity on discord, they not even close enough to nailing in the features/fixes/improvements :(((
---
Can't argue with that.
---
We spend our energy on things like strength an honor. Stacking rocks neatly we leave to alliance pantsys.
---
Give back Undead's ability to speak Common
---
Seal fatte is huge hit/crit depended. I played it once I get mc+bwl gear and its entertaining spec. Not recommended earlier tho. Earlier for daggers I recommend go for imp gouge. Open with cheap shot for more cps (ambush have much lower crit chance than backstab, you will not use that), autoattack wait for full energy + tick, gouge, backstab, 5cps evis. And so. Played daggers from the start and you will feel unique in that sea of sword rogues. 
---
I leveled as dagger, ambush - gouge - backstab - evis killed a lot of targets easily. Tanaris leveling was fun as daggers.
---
Warriors, rogues, and mages complain about being underpowered? 🤔
---
Bless your soul op. 
---
Thank you!
---
Barbaric Loincloth. Running around in tattered underwear in my gnome warrior was some of the funniest times I had in Vanilla.
---
Thanks! Really glad you like it  🙌
---
I’m not going to bother aligning with friends. Whenever i compromise it ends up for nothing because they quickly out level me or eventually play on an alternate schedule. Maybe i’ll faction transfer later on if i have to

Nope, see here:

---
Hi, /u/luvdagb
---
I like your discussion, I think you are both correct. A lot of locations can be different but mage will still be a contenter for world first level 60. Much moreso than for example warlock who's just a slower version of hunter.
---
Boomer meme lmfao
---
You never see dwarf priests posting threads because they’ve got nothing to compensate for.
---
dont overestimate the amount of hardcore fans doing that. the people on this sub are overproportionately hardcore fans. thats just what it is if you start lurking forums and youtube videos and subreddits months and years in advance to the game release your looking forward to.
---
the major core of the playerbase will be much more casual and give way less shits about min maxing. private servers are also not representative because they attract a more hardcore crowd too. it will be fine.
---
I realised around level 20, when I looked around and saw that literally no one was a night elf, that I chose the garbage race. I thought being an elf was cool shit. I have never been so wrong.
---
Your heads have always move toward your target as far as I can remember.

---
Thanks for posting this! I'll show this to my friends when they give me grief for wanting to play survival hunter exclusively lol
---
I was so excited for cata when it was announced. I thought the world being drastically changed would be cool. And flying mounts in azeroth?? Super sick.
---
2 weeks into cata and i was so bored I wanted to die. The changes to azeroth were nothing but a disappointment and I've been waiting ever since cata  for a vanilla only server. 
---
I remember being on my Moon priest in classic wow. I was in Blackrock mountain hiding at the top of one of the chains and I was MCing a horde raid into the lava nonstop for like 40 minutes. I particularly targeted a tauren warrior with a sword and shield. Hearthstones, eventually started poppin off and they all left one by one. I can't believe I legit stopped a raid from happening with MC/shadowmeld. Probably my biggest vanilla wow accomplishment.
---
I'd take a charming inconvenient game over a hollow convenient one any day.
---
I've been trying for years to get my friends to try a warcraft campaign in DnD, but they just dont like WoW like I do. Unfortunately, I suck at DMing, and I dont have any time at the moment to devote to it. Good luck though, sounds like a ton of fun.
---
&gt; in any other content in the game 
---
You *can* but you're still going to take the blame.  Premades won't accept you, in bgs or group/raid wPvP your best case is a silent indifference (since shit talk will be a common thing to suffer). Dungeons will be tricky due to warriors doing the tanking. 
---
So in the end "any other content" becomes a full solo game on a supportive melee with noone to support. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayx2ua/virgin_dwarf_fw_bot_vs_chad_night_elf_priest/

For me it is about the need to talk to people to do anything. Retail can be played without ever interacting with anyone. I guess that's the thing that destroyed retail for me.

I've got my computer hooked up to my 50inch flatscreen in my room. Its gonna be soooooo sick.

Man Belkin n52te was jam back in the day. It will always make me think of Tanking Naxx in WotLK for some reason (even though I had it long before). Literally just threw mine away 2 weeks ago. Was at my parents house and it had been in my old room still (broken). 
---
Rank one, you keep spamming to proc because there's only a gcd for the cooldown.
---
And yet, we still beat other healers on the meters fight dependent 
---
The argument around all this is lame anyway, most people won't even make it to raiding content in the first place. I never even made it to 60 in classic cus I was enjoying leveling alts/PVP so if you're serious about raiding you're gonna pick raid specs, if you PVP you'll pick PVP specs ect. same with every facet of the game.
---
It is, usually as a 3rd-4th tank. Remember there's fights requiring up to 8 tanks (4HM, even if this case requires all of them to be warriors) and druid has it easier to swap roles on the run compared to either a prot (who will struggle to deal damage, so he'll end up on nightfall/annihilator duty at best) or a full fury (who will be squishier than a properly geared bear).
---
Not to say for certain fights they have the upper hand vs warriors, usually resistance-centered or certain mechanic (Jin'do's polymorph).
---
I mean, he just gave you a list of reasons why they aren’t optimal PvPers
---
Yes, a guild with multiple world firsts was definitely super inefficient... lol. I bet 9/10ths of the raid was clicking their spells and weren't on VOIP, either.
---
For me, I'm gonna rush through the first 15 or so levels, because I've done them ad nauseam on every single race/class combo already. But then I'll slow it down and actually read all the quests and take time to work on professions. Heck, I'll even take the time to relax and do some fishing while drinking some beers IRL. 
---
So many memories of talking with my good buddy on Skype while we fished together at the pool in iron forge. It was the best of times.
---
Followed it to 39 so far. There is a few errors, but overall its great.
---
Fanboys! 
---
It is like your are walking around critiquing other people walking by, about a race only your are competing in. 
---
Bragging about world record walking time that you didn't get &amp; no one cares about. Except maybe the people in your boat, and that is why you are in that boat/guild. 
---
Funny, we know for a fact that these 'first' achievements did not actually play a factor at all during the rest of the life of the game. To this day, i don't give a flying fuck about my server first or anyone else's nor do i feel like boasting them in today's raiding environment. 
---
Only time they come up is when talking about memories with old guildies. It's serves at best as a scrap book, at least make it a good one. 
---
You're correct as far as I can remember, jumping only update your location on landing. Also why many people would jump around if they were expecting a warrior charge, in order to create some more distance for themselves.
---
So you are basically trailer-trash, spending all your time getting tattoos and lifting weights and screaming "WHATCHA LOOKING AT?!?!" while the Alliance carefully rebuilds civilisation 
---
According to my experience on a PS, dungeon parties will greet you with open arms. Also I received lots of whispers asking if I want to tank a dungeon (some of them were from people I was in a group with, others just used /who, I guess). So if your goal is to be a 5-man dungeon tank, you'll be fine. Also many PS guilds were willing to accept a feral druid in their rading roster, so maybe this time the situation will be better for feral druids on Classic.
---
This was before the Horde leadership became garbage.
---
It breaks while casting now
---
I can somewhat understand though.
---
Having a geared retardin translates to a useless BG spot with a paladin Blessing of Freedoming himself, so he can hit for 700crits sometimes while ignoring everybody else, not healing, cleansing or BoFing actual warriors.
---
The less geared retardins there are, the less you will see them derp around in BGs taking up a spot for an actual useful class.
---
Good that I'm playing horde though.
---
Night elf priest is the min/max combo for trolling though.  
---
Shadowmeld into Mind Control.  
---
Nice thanks for looking at it I think I’m gona use this

I miss the good old days. No "builds" and other bs. Just my friends and me exploring the world of Warcraft running into other bewildered strangers.

Hell yeah, suck that nerds, the kool kid is in town!

Point is average players playing warriors are closer to the bottom than the top on dps chart.

I realise that this is probably a joke, but please dont give them any ideas.

To kill stuff as a druid you basically have two choices. Get in a raiding guild and somehow get a ton of aq+ spellpower gear (you may need to buy off every mage/warlock/ele/spriest in your guild) and become a weird squishy healing mage, or go complete cat dps spec/gear which completely neuters your healing/attrition abilities (you know, druids actual strengths).  
---
In short, if you like seeing big numbers and splatting other people, unless you really like being the wonky red headed step child - don't go druid. 
---
I didnt say it was a raid.  Its pre raid bis bc dal rends is one of the many many difficult items to get over other melee
---
HA! Gonna be some nelf trash rolling up in this biotch.
---
Doesn't matter, you can still hide until they start running past you and most people won't react in time
---
My point exactly! Reading my post again, yeah i worded it poorly and 20% difference of total pop is actually a 50% difference comparatively. Thanks for your input! 
---
Big mood 
---
When I was a kid, I would hold a poop in for days. I enjoyed taking a monster dump once a week. I was proud. I didnt know that I was secretly training for the time I would need to grind mobs for 12 hours straight to level up, or just to get a rare drop. I held in a poop for the 8 hours it took my guild to complete Ice Crown Citadel. There were many times after a wipe where I could have scooted off and dropped that turd, but I felt like holding that bum-baby in actually kept me more focused. When we finally defeated that bitch boi arthas, I released the most satisfying toilet bomb ever. It was girthy, almost looked like I had ejected a softball from my rectum. I should have taken a picture of it.
---
And yes, my guild did suck enough to where it took us 8 hours to finish ICC. We were doing it on heroic with undergeared healers and DPS. Our main tank was godly, and would often be the last one alive, but his skill couldnt carry us. There was a lot of trial and error for each boss.

Yeah my comment is really incorrect. The problem isn't the healing. It's just that it takes too long. 3 seconds for first heal, 6 seconds for second. It's going to be very rare in a vanilla raid you'll get 3 ticks out of a rejuv. For 300 mana that's just really shit compared to casting 3 rank4 HTs - which you can cancel if you get sniped. I can guarantee the person you cast rejuv on often gets healed to full before the first tick lands, and you're not getting that mana back.
---
Happy cakeday!
---
My old 970 used to whine a lot regardless of frames, but that was just a bad batch. My current 1080TI has louder coil whine than fans. Guess I'm just unlucky on the batches.
---
If you have to defend flag, you kite (they can't catch you) and you moonfire from far away when they try to cap.
---
In WSG you will be the FC so yeah your role is to get flag and run away.
---
troll priest, a rarity indeed.
---
Sorry, it honestly takes exactly what you said.  You gotta investigate a string of them and piece it together, because they all lie, obfuscate and are impartial.  It doesn't matter if anyone claims objectivity or balance, there's always bias and it's up to you to figure it out.  It's why I have no hope for humanity.
---
Go Druid and Shaman.
---
Ah, that's fantastic, thank you so much!
---
This. Druid tanking sounds cool, shift out to brez/innervate, throw a couple of heals, maybe hibernate something. But really you will never get to do that. If you shift out you just become a really shitty tank, so you just sit in bear form and spam maul. Sometimes you get to spam swipe yay... compared to warrior that has to manage revenge/shield block/shield bash/last stand/shield wall/potions etc it just so simple.
---
you, it's definitely you
---
***stealth sound***
---
Playing some of these off specs is what makes me want a BC server. Enhancement and Ret were my favorite specs in BC, class fantasy felt perfect and their role in the raid felt right. Bring the group up, middle of the pack damage, a few cool tools that are handy in a pinch. 
---
Never considered shaman. We were thinking of being ally side. I sort of figured everyone and their nan would be a shaman on horde side.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **2nd Cakeday** PotatoA1mz! ^(hug)
---
Do you realize the amount anxiety you create?
---
Yes there is some things to do in bgs that don't come down to killing people. But there are often times when it's really handy to be able to kill people. Your wsg already has a FC. There's a fight at BS deciding the game. A t3 holy pally is spam /spitting you. These are all situations where a druid is just basically useless. Running away won't help. Every other class can spec to fight for pvp, but not druid - their best pvp spec is just speccing to run away.  
---
That's not necessarily a bad thing, some people enjoy it. But everyone should know what they're in for when they sign up.
---
From my experience, an RP-PVP server is the same as a normal PVP server, because nobody ever role plays. I tried to role play when I first started, and nobody would even talk to me. I hope that changes when classic comes out because I really want to role play. I've got my characters backstory worked out and everything. I want a DnD experience in WoW. Combining my two favorite games into one awesome adventure.
---
Ok, but does there really have to be a thread about this literally every day?  
---
If you can show up in time for world buffs you should be fine with basically any class pre aq40 tbqh. Like you'll still want lets say major healing/mana pots, bandages, greater fire prot potions,  but outside of that you can get by casually, and you can get enough gold for more of those from raiding itself if your raid doesn't wipe.
---
"it was to balance out horde being better"
---
Wow, that's just sad.
---
Oh did not consider Ally, was only thinking about lvling harmony and easy raid access as well as 5mans. Just consider travel speed as of lvl20, plus healing/rezz abilities.
---
Rejuv is good for fights with cleave and aoe raid damage though. I agree HT is going to be your most used spell but rejuv isn't redundant. 
---
Great, very insightful. Youtube and reddit would have you believe everyone needs every buff known to man to do anything.
---
What if we just prefer dwarves over poncy elves?
---
Honestly, if you only want to heal, do yourself a favor and roll a priest or pally.
---
Yeah im in that boat. I just prefer dwarf over nelf, regardless of racials
---
It's not a big deal. When they release TBC people can have all these specs anyways. When you think about it it's just this one part of endgame where a handful of specs aren't viable. You can play 80% of the classes, or 95% of the game and never run into the issue.

---
The K70 is good but it's super loud. I think I might just have to bite the bullet on a linear keyboard
---
Honest question, why don't you play a class that can DPS better than a paladin ?
---
Imagine if he had done the same with a rogue, he would have topped the DPS charts.
---
I wont be using this feature even if it's implemented.  
---
If you're leveling up a certain class like Balance Druid or Retribution Paladin you're going to see their weaknesses immediately and likely agree with raid meta that you're better off being a healer. You can decide if doing damage as your role is important enough to create another, more specialized DPS class.
---
I was so excited for Cata, until I started playing it. Cata made me lose the magic. The old world was gone, and replaced with GARBAGE. 
---
I was beyond elated to hear they were releasing classic again. Private servers just didnt have the same feel as playing legit retail. I'm gonna be right there with you, smoking a phat dab and grinding out a bunch of level 30s until I find the race/class combo that I want to main. I'm pretty sure I wanna be a warrior tank, because from what I hear they were the gods of classic wow, and I never played a tank before. I never got to raid in classic since I came in at the start of wrath, and I cannot fucking wait to play it with fresh eyes. It's going to be magical.
---
Imagine being this defensive about a joke post
---
Our first thought was druid hunter. She could be a hunter and its real low skill, they can wear near everything and she would enjoy the pets. I could be a druid and fill any role for dungeons and neither of us would be really gear dependent while leveling I don't think. They are also suppose to level quick so our minimal gametime would work out with that pretty well. Not settled on any final decision yet though.
---
Don't forget druid + rogue !
---
Does that mean I can play a Shaman as a Main Tank? /s
---
he doesnt have the required information
---
All points true. But getting a raid spot as a hunter is rather more difficult to get as opposed to shaman/pally.
---
How much would I have to pay a doctor to put me in a medically induced coma? Can i pay him in WoW gold?
---
Calm your tits there buddy, takes one to know one as they say.
---
You are literally the fucking devil. In WG this one guy got banned for just camping our flag room, waiting for our flag carrier to get back, BoPing them and claiming the flag for himself.
---
We have Genn. There can be no further argument. 
---
Ok, so what?
---
Whatever is the most authentic is best.
---
TILL YOU DIE
---
I didnt realize. Things are different now than vanilla. There was always a few hunters with us on raids back then and bein an alternate meant basically when absolutely everyone else was geared to the teeth I nosed out disenchanting for my upgrades lol.
---
Dwarves look like shit with a dress though.
---
Yeah, it's pretty much all edge lords that roll horde, thinking it's cool to be the bad guys. The Alliance is where it's at. You should get new friends.
---
You haven’t lived until you’ve hidden from some max level players, sitting on their mounts. Just praying your portrait doesn’t appear as their target of target.
---
I wont either but I was just wondering how it would all be handled.
---
Maybe once you enter Classic B.Net will automatically show you as "Offline" for your other friends who are on retail.
---
Classic is not a new game or even expansion (which you'd have to buy). It's just a freebie for WoW subscribers. Why would Blizzard advertise it much (or at all)?
---
They don't expect much money from it so they won't advertise it heavily.
---
Rolling a NE Priest is kinda like not being vaccinated. Not a problem if other priests around you are dwarves.
---
If the economy is already started it's not that hard to make gold in Vanilla. However on a fresh server where everybody is poor, that's gonna be "interesting" :o
---

I've got a pole for you to try 😏

Fun fact, the login screen music was composed by an Orc
---
Laughs in Human with my fat spirit bonus. 😱
---
yeah man those homeless people definitely have it better than you! 
---
Mage, Lock and Hunter would be what I suggest to anyone looking to get into raids with having a limited amount per day they can play.
---
Mages are always going to be sought after as they are high dps, vending machines, and bring decurse (along with damp/amp magic).
---
Warlocks bring the curses and banishes 
---
Hunter is well Hunter...
---
If 1 of you prefer a melee then go Rogue as again always will be needed or if you will be lvling as a duo then a fury warrior will have a raid spot as guilds will be wanting 5 furies.
---
I play both classes and feel stronger as a hunter due to high armor. Frost mages don't really delete targets, you'll have to spec elem or fire for that.
---
I’m so looking forward to Mind control. Love the idea of shadow meld into mind control but I can’t bring myself to roll night elf 
---
This can also apply to all of the many classic youtubers who don't have anything new to talk about but somehow manage to make a new video to discuss the most recent speculation.
---
Don't give into the peer pressure. A Nelf Priest is 10x better than a Ret Pally or a Boomkin Druid
---
I have a few videos of Undercity Elevators doing wierd shit from Vanilla.
---
I have one where I noticed that when riding the elevator my pet would vanish. So I cast Eyes of the Beast and found out he got insta-teleported under Tarren Mill, where he fell off the map. Then he just comes back when I walk off the elevator 0_o
---
The other Undercity lifts one, is when it de-sync'd. I would reach the the top or bottom and the door would close instead of open, wile the opposite door opened. I was stuck fo a while before I workd out how to glitch through it.
---
Hunter is as much skill as you bring to the table. If you care to dig a little bit you'll find you can do outstanding things with a hunter ... or just be a huntard ...
---
And for a beginner it's not ideal, there's so much things to bind (I count 11 binds just to manage the pet !!!).
---
We're afraid of mage/warrior/rogue because we will likely suck and if everyone wants to be one to top the epeen chart we'll probably not get to do anything often.
---
Consider a prot warrior, holly pal and priest ... whatever rogue spec you'll choose will be fine ;-)
---
A raid want to take 8 resto shamans, that's 20% while shamans as a class make up 12-14% of the Horde. So resto shamans will always be in demand!
---
I understand your point, and while it's true, I'd like to think that our desire to get back to where warcraft came from and get to know each other in a friendly manner again is stronger than our desire to shame people for being the wrong spec.
---
Either way, there's going to be guilds for everyone, so don't worry about it and just choose the one that fits with you.
---
Every server will have hardcore guilds that allow no off specs, require full buffs, and farming for BiS pieces in their leading edge progression raids.
---
Every server will also have less hardcore groups that will allow 5-10 off specs,and less strict on buffs.
---
Then there's the guilds where anything goes.
---
Pick what fits with you.
---
thank you!
---
This is just stupid. Is Classic not releasing this summer, or what? It's almost summer, and we still know basically nothing.
---
A lot of turtles are impatient and made it to the private servers. If we had at least a date, so we would know what to expect... or at least another demo, alpha, beta or whatever...
---
Paladin have the best lore tbh, druids also have great lore. Shamans as well.
---
In game however, Warlocks and Rogues have great class quests.
---
I played dagger Rogue exclusively in vanilla. Its fun for pvp and Dungeons if you Like seeing yourself deal high damage with your backstabs. As for world farming it is alright, but you will spend some time standing behind gouged targets, waiting for energy regen, which is a bit boring in My opinion.
---
Oh i agree easy to be a hunter hard to be a good hunter. But i know she'd enjoy it.
---
I only loved the isle because it became the new STV for me. 
---
At the height of Your Bummed, we were the most successful troll group in server history. 
---
If there weren't enough Alliance, we'd usually find a priest willing to mind control horde and mow them down too.
---
The animosity from preventing people from doing daily quests was pretty awesome to a 17 year old kid
---
I intend to play shadow priest and /spit on anyone who says I should re spec to heal. I will raid as shadow. 
---
I’m such a great person nobody will refuse me, I’m sure of it. 
---
I‘d prefer leveling as arms on retail classic, as you get the ability to stance dance which is incredibly nice for low level tanking plus with this specc you also can tank on 60 easily till you got the gear to specc fury or whatever you want 😜
---
Damn I think I’m convinced to go shaman. 
---
Dude...... I was so pissed
---
Then preceded to make my own macro lmao
---
NE is better for PVP. Its difficult to imagine any priest being left outside for 40 man, even Onyxia.
---
I hate that being a dwarf priest automatically makes you a minmaxer now.
---
I play dwarf everything in any game I can.  Tabletop RPGs, MMO's, hell 90% of my decision to buy Deep Rock Galactic is that it had 4 dwarves mining as the main premise.
---
This is gonna get really old for someone who never thought about the min/max of rolling dwarven priest.
---
But i disagree about not ideal for beginners. In vanilla I was a fucking space cadet and did just fine. There cannot be a dumber class.
---
Oh man. So using this lmao
---
Right near 1000 needles?  Im rolling on your server and setting up a permanent post to watch this.
---
Even the odd sap and leave causes ptsd
---
You play with sound off, or what?
---
Sometimes I used to "miss" the water when jumping into it in various places and just go splat on the ground below the water.
---
The drop into Maraudon, or the lava at BRM specifically come ti mind.
---
Water anyone??
---
What a great contribution to this discussion. Would you like a medal?
---
That's the thing and ultimately what bothers me most with people that want to pretend that ret Pallys are fine. News flash folks, they're not good at dpsing in PvE.  Just because they can doesnt mean they are good at it and I've seen WWWAAAYYY too many who are huntard levels of terrible that embarrass themselves and hold others back because of a selfish whim. 
---
Let's be perfectly clear here. If you are capable of putting in the work required to make a ret Pally a valuable raid member then you will have a place in near any guild out there. The problem is if you put the same amount of work into a fury warrior, rogue, mage or lock, well... you would DEMOLISH whatever dps number you had as a ret Pally and it frequently wouldnt even be close. That's reality people
---
Myself, I was a prohunter and only marked rogues and druids. Otherwise, \[Track Humanoids\]
---
&gt;If B.Net support is enabled for Classic, would this mean that we would be able to add/see our Battle Net friends by pressing "O" and thus be able to chat with friends who are the opposite faction?
---
Yes.
---
Why is this a problem here?
---
If you have healer friends behind your back and you enjoy BG's then it's warrior. 
---
If you're more of a solo wpvper then rogue is the answer.
---
For PvE both classes are interesting to play, you get more of a reaction and opportunity based gameplay as warrior, unlike rogue with comfy ability to plan your rotation way ahead.
---
Warrior is probably the more social class. You can tank groups and find groups easier, you'll need to group up more often for quests, and people will just in general treat you better.
---
Both classes are good in both pvp and pve, although the warrior almost requires a healer/group for pvp so i guess it depends on whether you want to do group pvp or solo pvp.
---
Holy shit dude no one if forcing you to play with ret paladins. Just join a hardcore guild so you won't have to worry about them. Let people have their fun. 
---
Warrior. Having the ability to tank seems very valuable and will make you quite a popular friend.
---
Rogues feel like a dime a dozen...
---
How many people did not bother, knowing tbc was on the horizon?
---
But 1-2% of na players if i recall
---
But you could still vanish spells like deathcoil in TBC, hell even blind 
---
Being able to see what members of the opposing faction is online, and especially what zone they're in if that info is available, is huge info. Where is the enemy guild? Are they raiding? Are they farming devilsaur leather? I'm gonna go head to Un goro to kill them.
---
Similarly, being summoned over the edge of the elevators when joining an RFK group - still did the dungeon though. :p
---
Watching my whole party die as they hit the water is the reason I always look down when jumping into water from height.
---
This. It's also why you weren't allowed to roll both factions on the same PVP realm, because you could just join on the opposite faction and harass or spy on your enemies etc.
---
Pro tip. Go elemental. 
---
I love enhance in vanilla,  but elemental is broken good.
---
Get nature's swiftness.
---
You said you played shaman in TBC, which I played from vanilla to wrath. 
---
Though when I do think of my shaman,  he has his earthshaker and crown of rag with his big Tauren ass.....
---
Shamans are amazing in vanilla.  Probably the best they ever were 
---
Why the hell there are so many female druids? You don't care about lore in Classic?
---
Vitamin D brotha, take them vitamins!
---
Rank 1 chain heal at that
---
&gt; Therefore, Fear Ward is not needed for end game raids.
---
Tremor totems and undead Priests with will of forsaken means they can break fears to spot heal and/or dispel other priests fears.
---
The game is somewhat balanced between factions, but it isn't balanced in a one-for-one way. There is no other reliable way to break fears in vanilla for alliance. That makes thicc dwarves pretty important. The other options are just laughable.
---
BC is my favorite game ever made and while I do love Vanilla, BC is the better game by a fair margin. Class and spec balance was one of those reasons. Obviously there were specs that were lackluster BUT balance, particularly for hybrid specs, was infinitely better than Vanilla
---
Yeah, that's how it'll be and it'll be good. I'm just tired of browsing this sub and seeing people not say, but DECLARE, I am raiding as X. I even saw someone say they will not heal as a Paladin in anything but cloth. Like, dude, sure, but why? If you can make it work, great. But I really, REALLY doubt even a tenth of these people really understand what they are getting into. No one is going to take them on raids with the attitudes they have. Rather, they won't progress the way they thing.
---
One guy I saw was popping off about wearing his T2 as a Paladin in raids even though there are certain, easier to obtain pieces that are better. And I was left extremely perplexed as to how this fucking dingbat thought he was even going to get T2. Like, that's MONTHS and MONTHS of work. And if your attitude is that you aren't even going to be bothered to wear the gear that is better, there's absolutely no way you're getting even a few pieces of T2. 
---
I think there is a severe lack of understanding from what appears to be a vast majority of people who plan on playing, to be honest. And it's frightening, frankly. If the community really thinks they are all going to hop into the game, play whatever the hell they want, not even wearing the best gear they have so they can maintain some childish sense of playing with a cool looking action figure, then I don't have hopes for the longevity of this.
---
If the private server community pulls through, it'll be great. But I'm worried a lot of these people don't remember Vanilla correctly. They haven't played a private server and their only memories are shrouded in harmful nostalgia. I'm thinking most aren't even going to make it to 60, let alone get to the point where they are refusing to wear certain pieces of gear to get their T2 aesthetic. I can't help but laugh at the absurdity. But then return to being worried and confused. 
---
I'm 100% not ok with a full fledged B-net in classic (yet I know I'll probably just have to deal with it)
---
However with some restrictions, I have zero issue. Things like:
---
* No visable Location on B-net, Just 'Playing World of Warcraft'. World PvP.
---
* No 'friend - right click - add' from chat. You should have to talk to achieve this. It also helps stop toxicity. 
---
* No community chat in game, Guilds need to matter. At best, make your own in-game chat channel.
---
* I'm hesitant about 'Person-A is online' Toasts but i don't think the fallout will be too bad.
---
* Zero opposite faction interaction.
---
- I also don't know if Live chat restrictions are part of B-net but they need to go too.
---
Okay but b.net doesn't give that info?
---
weird flex but ok
---
Now, who the hell started playing WoW in BFA, and then moved to a Legion private server?
---
Show yourself!
---
Classic will be the same as any server.
---
Kids will roll Horde for l33t pvp racials and camp Redridge and STV, while people actually wanting to play the game will go Ally and progress through content, eventually out ranking, gearing and skilling the kids making their racials worth nothing.
---
Remeber alt+q+q in war2?
---
This was my meme 2v2 strategy in TBC.
---
Worked surprisingly well lmao
---
Someone spent a whole day having fun, how terrible
---
It does on retail. It tells me what zones my friends are in at least. 
---
It's more about people feeling "forced" to play races they do not like because of racial abilities. People just advocate that you play what you think is cool, and that's exactly what you are doing! You are just lucky your preferences align with the meta. 
---
RRROOOAAARRR!!! That race of whores that dance on mailboxes and reaches into me pants for their "payment" dares call me ugly?!?
---
With that said, nothing wrong with choosing a different lesser race to play as. As many have said, the race/class combo isnt the be all end all. Definitely need to be more 
---
Well then you came to the wrong game, buddy. 
---
This is the best.
---
And this is why people who play on pservers should have quit playing them  back in '17 when classic wow got announced as being a thing.
---
This game is going to be a monotonous grind for people still playing classic every week in 2019.  I cant wait to get back into MC, but I also havent seen it in over a decade.
---
besides, do you really need all of your priests to be dwarves in your guild? Especially if there's a NE priest that can output better healing or knows how to manage their threat better.
---
I mean obviously 2 priests of the same skill, the dwarf is gonna be picked, but I have a feeling that not every guild is gonna have all dwarf priests.
---
Okay so this won't be a problem unless you are friends with every player on the opposing faction.
---
Yet people still play this class and get butthurt when they can't find a guild willing to take them through raids. 
---
Wouldnt having fear ward and stoneskin be better in PvP then shadowmeld and 1% extra dodge chance?
---
If excluding PoM Pyro then hunter is going to have higher PvP burst.  Aimed/auto/multi is pretty hard to beat and with raid gear it gives you a good chance with a crit to just delete an enemy clothy.  Throw in the ZG trinket and you can add in an extra multi/etc occasionally.  
---
Ty for the replies! :)
---
There were a few little tournament style thingoes in vanilla but they were very rare. How popular even bg premades or pvp in general will be remains a big unknown I think. It will be interesting to see what happens.
---
Well i appreciate the reply.  Sucks that people feel pigeonholed, but I dont see why the racials should matter.  Bluzzard cant have designed the content with the racials in mind.
---
Ah, one of the things I doscovered all by myself back in 2006, used to visit all the time I was in the area, even if it was just a brown flat area
---
Who needs a taunt?
---
We had a t2/AQ geared pally solo LBRS by aoe then to death and self healing.  But here is the but.  It takes a lot longer then 5manning them.  So not worth it.  You hit for little and waste a shield or two and spend most of it healing your self.  Not to mention how long it will be before reaching that level.  
---
Now paladins are wrecking balls on the ud (none casters) so chaining the field/cauldron quest for that one and grinding it over and over is another thing to get your rep up.  
---
Attended a couple of awesome tournaments down at Gurabashi. This was an RP server though so don’t know if that made the attitude a little different but there were few interruptions and ‘guards’ to take out any trouble makers. Was great even as a spectator.
---
&gt;watching a commercial in 2019
---
Cool, well this explains a bit the results with distracting dagger. Very eager to see the source! Do you plan to stick with finding a general average and solving DPS purely with math? Or any plans on moving to a simulation type solution?
---
You can set up things like that but it's usually just well known pvpers going to opposite faction cities and picking fights with people. If you're on a pvp server there should be plenty of chaos.. there will be 1v1s, 1v1s that turn into 1v2, 2v1, 3v5, etc.. everyone will be different levels while we're leveling so it doesn't have to be 2v2 or 3v3, it's more about skill. Like a bunch of low levels can kill a 60 if they band together and it's super fucking fun. Coming from a dark souls background you'll feel very at home on a pvp server.
---
Is that retail or privat server? Because I never herd anyone solo scholo on retail.  Because the spawning adds because the casters because the patrols would make it very hard. I don’t trust any proof from a private server as they are known for not getting everything right.  Welp room is another room that I doubt you could make.  Hell i know it could take out a hunter and a mage with incoming Heals from a decent healer.  If you had the slightest bad luck with the fire balls.  
---
Fear ward is great, it gives you an extra save but better if they never see you at all. Hiding in BGs is OP.
---
&gt;	can't maximize it's cash shop model due to the game's culture and purpose
---
God I hope this remains true. 
---
This is what I want. I will do everything in my power to help organise this if anybody else is interested. The possibilities are endless, tournaments, team fights, prizes, entrance fees/rewards etc. 
---
I’ll happily guard, I enjoy watching pvp! 
---
This is the sort og meta-meme i need to keep me distracted until Classic launch!
---
WTF is a genn? This is classic wow.
---
You could also just practice and you'll get there.
---
Druids, Shamans, Paladins and Warlocks are the most lore heavy classes I'd say.
---
I‘m still waiting for a release date to put in some vacation days :(
---
In what region do you plan to play (EU or NA) and what faction do you want to play?
---
Yeh I was hoping it would be fun! I always regretted not playing a pvp server, but I figured I just wanted to level up and not be griefed. I have since then become obsessed with pvp in dark souls, and can’t bring myself to play a PVE server again. 
---
Praise the sun! 
---
Please do. Those people that took the initiative to organise and advertise these sort of things are the people who made some of my best WoW memories.
---
Not in my experience, then again, I play as bear tank and not as a warrior.
---
Me that kind of orc
---
&gt;Druids have quests and lore for their forms. Got Moonglade which is cool
---
This is true for bear and aquatic form. Sadly, there is no cool quest for cat form, travel form, and moonkin.
---
*Yes, I know moonkin form is a talent. Would be cool if it was a quest instead though.*
---
You are thinking about wolfshead and it does not give you full energy.
---
I'll be leveling a shaman first, without following any speed guides, just following the adventure and turning him into an awesome resto at 60.
---
Next I'll be leveling a shadow priest. I had considered doing the shadow priest first because melting faces is fun, but they are sooooo far behind the curve in endgame that you'd REALLY have to fight for a spot in a group, so he'll be my second char that gets into my raid spot when we are farming already cleared content. :) I might use a speed guide for him so I can add him to my level 60 fun quickly after the shaman.
---
Some people are more important than others. Knowing where the opposing guild leader is or knowing that a certain class is or isnt somewhere is enough to affect things. If you see that someone in a well known premade is in a raid, you know that it's "safe" to spam bgs without running into that premade, or if you see that a couple people from a notorious ganking guild is in Winterspring, you know it's safer to go do MC or BRD or whatever.
---
I think undergeared druid is a better tank than undergeared warrior in MC, because you have more health and more armor. And threat generation is much better
---
You are right should have mentioned sorry xD alliance and eu
---
You all do realise you need to accept a friend request in order to actually see this info?
---
Can't just add random people and see what they're doing.
---
one of each
---
Spot on man. Great post. I wish more people on this sub could foresee this reality. 
---
People think they’re gonna blow through naxx in a couple months with a raid full of moonkins. They’ve only played since wotlk, but they heard that vanilla is easy because the private server community is getting pretty efficient at it now. If they make it to 60 they’ll uninstall the third time they have to reclear the trash in MC on a Friday night. 
---
Everytime i came to the main citys the first time i took the time and went to silvanas or thrall and kneeled before them. I cant wait to pay them respect again!
---
See, this is why I never got into overclocking
---
ever consider that private server players just love this game so much that they never wanted to quit? The nostalgia sheen wears off pretty quick - but in the end you’re still playing a great game. Just depends if you’re playing because you love the game as it is, or because you love the game as you remembered it. At least private server players have realistic expectations. 
---
I check the blizz forums every few hours at least... 
---
Mom's spaghetti? Oh, nvm
---
yep. have fun with the ret hype while it lasts up until release and reality sets in folks. 
---
Because it's a f*cking game, and some people like the fantasy of a certain class, and at the same time don't like to be a healbot?
---
Plus, because it's a f*cking game, dude.
---
Who cares? Wanna enjoy the game. If I need hurry, i just drive to late to work every morning 
---
What happens in... Stays in...
---
I know now tho:-D
---
What on earth was your route? 
---
I actually gave a few level 40’s gold for mount, sure I could farm it myself but its nice seeing how happy people get. 
---
Go say that to the speedrunning community over at r/speedruns
---
No but the reason they removed them later is that they started designing content with Players in mine, as players will minmax even racials. That is understandable enough. For clsssic tho I hope they tell everyone to suck it, I want it to stay a genuine mmo rpg, even add to it more, rather than slowly stripping it away. 
---
Then it’s fine ofc!
---
Never understood the min/max mentality in classic. Was this ever a thing in retail vanilla or is it something that spawned out of p servers? 
---
But you lose all that attack power. Surely you just marked them after aimed shot drops them to 10% hp?? 
---
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say he levelled in mulgore.
---
There will probably be more shaman than priests, but most of them will be trying to make enhancement work. Depending on the guild the enhancement shaman may not even get a raid slot.
---
People enjoy things differently than you. Try not belittling others achievements just because you personally don't enjoy it.
---
Ok there is quite some misinformation here. Druids do absolutely innervate themselves when they need it, that is particularly true for deep resto (Swiftmend) Druids.
---
But if you run an optimized setup then HoTs have diminishing returns. They simply don't stack on the same target. Meaning you don't want to have more than one *maybe* two Druids using them.
---
This is where the Moonglow spec comes in. A super efficient Healing Touch based build. This build simply doesn't have the same mana problems as a Swiftmend Druid or a Holy Priest. The build trumps with efficiency but doesn't have the same raw output as the other builds so you are *free* to use your innervate on other healers.
---
Dwarf priest is like wearing diapers: you’ve never learned to do without. 
---
Doesn’t matter only class that matters is warrior
---
It 100% comes down to the guild. Some guilds are competitive and bench people who aren't pulling their weight on dps meters, others will be happy as long as you aren't wiping the raid for dumb reasons. Search around and let people know your situation and you'll almost certainly find a guild that's happy to take you along!
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **5th Cakeday** ignitar! ^(hug)
---
Of course but the route around there, unless Shammy is mad efficient around the zone...
---
This line of thinking pushed the Druid more and more into specialized roles over later expansions and basically streamlined the class into being just as everyone else with Druid paint on top.
---
The big reason I love vanilla Druids is that they have this tradeoff. And the combination of all the "watered down" roles actually makes them incredibly strong in PvP, open world and small group (5-20) content. They aren't optimal in the highly specialized 40mans but they sure damn have their unique strengths there too.
---
the route: https://i.imgur.com/lqAVC4O.jpg
---
&gt;I'm hesitant about 'Person-A is online' Toasts but i don't think the fallout will be too bad.
---
If the ingame setting for this will be anything like the retail version, you'll be able to disable these via the interface-options menu by removing the checkmark for "Show Toast Window" under "Social". Friends comming online / going offline toasts can be also be disabled separately. But that's about it.
---
&gt; Zero opposite faction interaction. 
---
Presumably hard to enforce as the bnet chat (real ID / battle tag) doesn't happen on a character level. Battle-net-level communities could be used to circumvent this restriction, if blizzard were to enforce this on a player-to-player level. Not to mention that the option of players using multiple accounts is always lingering.
---
Seriously, just chill. If you are a hardcore min/maxer just build a friend list and enter a guild of liked minded people. It is not retail where you end up playing with randos for a lot of stuff . If you end up in a guild that allows wrong spec raiding and progress is not fast enough for you, just change guild. 
---
I agree with you on the fact that if some roasters are playing with non optimal composition, they should be revised their progression speed expectations between/within raid tiers. Optimal or not depending on the content you are tackling .
---
 
---
Also remember that some class had total crap talent tree at the start of the game and they got improved in 1.12. I've been a resto druid from the vanilla start and balance/feral were unusable until patch 1.8 . Innervate was the final talent in resto tree , so you had to spec full resto for raiding. It changed after 1.9 (or like) and it's just a spell now, opening more options like the 30/21 build once you progressed in gear. It's not heal optimal but to rejuvenate and cleansebot later on its fine, maybe be not fox naxx but you can be an off tank ( but it requires gear, hence time /dedication and still a min/maxing mindset to make things work)
---
But I do agree that where some class got more spec options at the end of vanilla , some spec arent viable still because of lack of proper gear that will exists in TBC.
---
Join a guild that is like minded, be an officer or let the officers do their job and enjoy the game.
---
People will join the game, some will never reach 60 , let alone enter BWL , AQ ,Naxx. That's fine , just play with people that you want to play with , let the others have their fun. It's not world of "retail dungeon finder instant teleport I don't know anyone" but vanilla wow.
---
Chill :) it's bad for your ❤️.
---
that's rude 
---
This is so true and I really stand behind this statement. The versatility and flexibility of the class is what made it great in vanilla.
---
This unique identity was taken away from druids in later expansion as people felt the need to whine about not being the best at any given role.
---
Druids are in my opinion, with Shamans and Paladins to a slightly lesser degree, a huge missed design opportunity by Blizzard because they started to appeal to the masses with balancing/changeing the class. Generally pushing everyone into specialized roles instead of embracing flexibility and creating content where flexibility becomes even more of an advantage.

---
All like 30 of that extra spell power :O
---
Didnt know being a geared ret made me forget that my utility is the main reason im in bgs. Allright then
---
Classic is based on Legion client so specs will be more close to retail than original vanilla (and pservers).
---
Here are requirements for retail: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459
---
You can make Ret work just fine, especially if you are willing to go all-the-fuck-out for consumables, grinding particular equipment that's useless for anyone else, and accept that you will always be last in line for desirable loot.  The real hard part is finding a group that's willing to accept you.  They have a good reason not too, of course - you'll never be fury warrior material, always second banana to them.  
---
HotW is a strong PvP build IMO if you are gearing properly. Don't fall into the trap of going for too much feral damage. Just get the appropriate survival gear with + healing, stamina, int and look for +armor and +resistances where you can.
---
Aye I find it likely that a lot, perhaps most, of people are underestimating the amount of work vanilla takes to get things, or how much extra work it means to play sub optimally. Here is the thing though: let them. Anyone who cares can do different, and they can find themselves the guilds who will let them. In a true mmo-rpg like classic, and unlike retail, people should be allowed to fail, to be scrubs, to be unique little sub optimal snowflakes. The games design allows for it, and so should we.
---
For PvE you just gear efficiently for the role you are in. For PvP you gear for a mix of survivability and +healing.
---
Cant talk for all servers, but it certainly was a thing. Alliance put a huge premium on dwarf priest and hord spend a lot of time ridiculing how bad the alliance warriors must be in order to need fear ward to do raiding, maybe partly due to being extremely jealous of how much better it was than tremor tottems and the huge delay and short range that thing had. 
---
In general there was a fair bit of focus on what kind of raceials you got, but WAY less understanding of how stats work and what kind of stats where good on gear, there was a lot more focus on the color and item levels than what the gear actually brought except for maybe weapons.
---
do take in mind that this is my personal experience playing on several servers, hord and alliance, pve and pvp, over the course of vanilla wow, the culture on servers where vastly different so experiences may vary.
---
looooooool
---
Warrior quests fit the aesthetic well imo. Brawler, soldier, weapon and gear rewards really helps to make your char feel powerful.
---
well at first nobody knew about this stuff and picked their race and class for flavour and personal preference - the natural way!
---
maybe when people started making alts or recruiting for really serious guilds they started to min-max their race and class combos but at first it wouldn't have been much of a thing
---
Hey this sounds what I’m looking for unfortunately that link has expired apparently can I get a fresh one?
---
Absolutely, thanks for letting me know about the link, I've updated it in the main text too.

https://discord.gg/JDHrnU3
---
Surprised humans are at the bottom.
---
I recommend you go for standard Feral: 14/32/5 for leveling. You can heal/tank/dps in *all* leveling dungeons with this and an appropriate gear swap.
---
My recommended leveling spec progression (PvP server) is:
---
First get charge because it is simply amazing to have:
---
5/5 Ferocity, 5/5 Feral Instinct, 1/1 Feral Charge
---
Then get Furor so you can instant charge and do other stuff after shifting:
---
5/5 Furor
---
Then build up the Feral tree until you have 5/5 Heart of the Wild and 1/1 Leader of the Pack.
---
Then you fill out the points in balance.
---
When you hit 60 and want to focus more on group content you can go for the more flexible HotW build so you can heal in harder content more easily.
---
Ty. Was able to trace a bit further back :)

This is some high quality H2O

My mom liked that I was into things like WoW and Yugioh because at least she knew i wasnt out partying and doing drugs.
---
This was taken on a film camera and we didn't have a scanner at the time so unfortunately it would've been an impossibility!
---
How often do you delete your post history?
---
Getting 5/5 Furor right after Feral Charge and Feline Swiftness is probably the strongest line of play. It is an incredibly powerful talent and is IMO far more important than anything in the Feral tree outside of charge.
---
What? I said no changes damnit! You gotta take the good with the bad. 
---
wow that map really reminds me of the game Giants: Citizen Kabuto and the map maker that came with it.  that game was criminally underrated and was really gorgeous for it's time

hmm i dunno i think the otehr guy is right.  i never did RPPVP on wow but i did on age of conan and our server literally ended up with a huge guild called SCUM that spent their entire lives ganking lower levels as much as possible.  RP was veeery rare
---
the sad part is that SCUM always got shrekt in a fair fight haha
---
99% of retpaladins in random BGs both in vanilla and on pservers use(d) BoF on themselves and rarely cleanse anyone. 
---
It sure is a meme that rets are trash, but it holds some truth in a lot of cases.
---
It takes me one hour to finish starting area excuse me what the fuck. Cool shit.
---
the picture that got me to play was on the original webpage in the classes section and it was a screenshot of a hunter in (if i remember correctly) feralas or un'goro, standing with their pet
---
i never played a hunter, and in fact hated them in game, but there was something about the sense of adventure and fantasy in that image.  traveling this crazy bright green jungle in 3D with a pet looked awesome - until then i had mostly played isometric RPGs and a couple of FPS/TPS so to have a 3D RPG was mind blowing to me

How many of the rets, ferals, or whatever back in the day would have rather played something else though? But were stuck with their character due to time invested. 
---
I too think playing pretty much anything is fine if you really want to, but the question is, *do you really want to*? 
---
In reality, if you are a pala, you are a healer. You can spec into different things, but you're still just a healer who can do a bit of tanking/dps if you really want to. So it doesn't actually make sense to roll a pala if what you want out of WoW is to dps or tank. This is true, but to different degrees for the other "hybrid" classes. And this is why it's worth discussing, just because you *can* play a spec doesn't mean it's actually the spec for you. So when someone is asking "can I play ret pala in classic?" the constructive answer is not "play whatever you want", because in all likelihood if someone asks that question they are unsure if they want to play it or not, so give them some actual information about it instead. 
---
Race/class combos I completely agree with, it's not important, on the other hand, people asking about it is good, so they can learn what the difference actually is. They could obviously look at one of the many other 100 threads on the subject, but if everyone did that there wouldn't be any posts about anything on this sub, so yeah. 
---
Basshunter 24/7 until level 60. 
---
Your question is too imprecise which is why the answers you will be getting are are over the place.
---
First off all it doesn't matter *too* much how you'll spec as a Druid. If you are feral, HotW or Swiftmend simply gives you different strengths but the playstile is roughly the same.
---
I'am of the opinion that at a high level of play there is almost no ceiling for any class. You can always play *better* and get more out of your class because there are just way too many abilities, consumables, tactics and things that happen in a PvP situation or BG match.
---
That said, we can generally talk about the barrier of entry for those classes in PvP or in other words the skill-floor: *How hard it is to be servicable/average/decent at these classes in PvP?*
---
If were answering this question, I would say Druid is a bit on the harder side, depending on how you view the game and what your general playstile is. Druids are very much about movement, timing, patience, and you need to know how much you can take. All of these things require quite a bunch of experience.
---
I would say to be a decent Druid in PvP is almost as hard as being a decent Hunter, but definitely harder than Mage or Warlock. Hunters have a bit of a steeper learning curve for PvP initially because they need to be very precise with their movement and timings, while Druids have more leeway and are less punishable. Mages and Warlocks have a more straight forward playstile so it is easier to be decent at them.
---
Never

Hi, /u/WT100N
---
Give me these freaking und mounts!!!
---
Mm I dunno. You get 20 energy every 2 seconds right, so essentially it saves you 4 seconds of waiting for every time you shift to cat form. So the question is "is waiting 4 seconds everytime you go into cat form - at most once a minute? worth getting delaying core dps skills like savage fury, lotp, ff, sharpened claws for 5 levels?"  
---
I get having furor is nice, particularly for pvp, and it's not going to make a massive difference either way... but from a strictly efficiency focused levelling build I doubt early furor is worth it.
---
we once had a good holy pala who leveld a second pala to play him as ret in twink/pug raids
---
thats how you do it!
---
There was one blue post about it where he said it was unlikely but nothing has been confirmed yet.

---
Oh yea that is true, no q’s for cat or the rest
---
Thank so much for the the route. Post is bookmarked for later. I'll planning to lvl a shamy too. Will see how long it will take me. Probably more like 3 hours :D
---
Aimed shot? Go BM and your pet can solo every class except warlocks perhaps
---
On the feral side you prioritize mostly on stuff that improves either *both* bear and cat or *bear*, and never just cat, because the build is suboptimal for DPS anyways. You *can* DPS with the build but you won't be advertising yourself for it, if you know what I mean.
---
Now the exception is Feline Swiftness because just by putting 1 point in there you can already catch up or get away from most players that are not running a speed boost. For example if you are finishing someone off who is running a way you will mostly use cat for that, having that extra bit of MS will make it impossible for the opponent to get away w/o cooldowns.
---
If you still want to improve your cat DPS then you have 2 choices: Blood Frenzy and Improved Shred. Blood Frenzy is the vastly superiour choice in this case, so put points in there if you want to.
---
As for the Resto tree you obviously take 5/5 Furor, 5/5 Impr. HT and 1/1 Nature's Swiftness. The points in between are the tricky ones. If you are PvP focussed you won't get away w/o taking 5/5 Nature's Focus IMO. Reflection is very powerful and the other healing talents you can reach now are about equally strong.
---

don't even dare speak about 10-19 WSG
---
my server was lucky if we won 1 AV in 2 months as alliance 
---
Personally I don't care. It's probably not going to ruin the game. Some of the things people worry about are able to be worked around anyway. Take these two examples:
---
* Want to chat with a friend in the opposite faction?   
---
We have huge screens (possibly multiple of those). Chat via &lt;insert favorite chat program&gt; in separate window on separate screen.
---
* Want to know where someone is in game?  
---
Free test accounts are a thing for a long time so even on a PvP server you can do this to check the opposite faction with `/who` in chat.
---
If Blizzard disables/restricts B.Net: Fine. If Blizzard keeps it in the game: Fine. Couldn't care less. :-) 
---
10 times is a bit exaggerated, perhaps 1.2 times would be a better number.
---
Theres also beggers who have a home and just dont want to work
---
While that is technically true. The modern specs are largely a result of the large number of models and textures used in modern environments. Not necessarily because the game client is slower these days.
---
When running with lower poly count models and smaller resolution textures like classics, we will likely see good performance on hardware closer to the modern minimum specs rather than the modern recommended specs..
---
I'm curious to see how they will handle the talent Entrapment when triggered by a Frost Trap. For a majority of vanilla it didn't pulse on the hunter's trap location but instead was an aura around the hunter. It was f-cking OP when you were actively trying to slow down a group and a nightmare as entering the melee range of a hunter means constant root pulses.
---
Like: What you want to rush and chase our flag? Too bad that there is this 5 sec root pulsing next to you every second with no DR on it ... I guess you have to fight the hunter after all.  
---
Then again a properly working Entrapment on my actual Frost Trap would be wonderful as well. Perma roots in choke points ... oh the possibilities ;)  
---
Furor blows any of those DPS talents out of the water. It is not even close. I was also first of the opinion that it wasn't needed and the juicy % based stuff in the feral tree is worth getting earlier. But out of experience I have to say it is an absolute must have after getting charge and swiftness.
---
For cat, 4 Seconds of doing white hits is a *very* long time, considering the length of a 1 mob fight, which is only like 3-4 times that amount. Also you'll be switching in and out of cat quickly to Hot yourself quite regularly. If you time this right you get an energy boost every time. Cat DPS is super energy and yellow-hit dependand especially since you don't have any +hit talents and your strongest moves are bleeds, so you want energy ASAP.
---
Now for bear this is even more important. If you're in a leveling dungeon you can bet your ass people won't give you time to assert threat on mobs. You have to pull and then instantly shout-&gt;swipe every time. Also you will feel absolutely crippled while leveing if you cannot instantly use charge after shifting to bear.
---
It also works pretty bad if you have crappy gear as in late start on an expansion, they roflstomp you and is hard, kinda like vanilla heheh
---
I waited. For something.  
---
Our full guide for alliance is complete but won’t be released until before Classic launch as we will continue to refine it until then especially for melee classes. We released a 1-19 sample recently so players can evaluate its quality early before buying the whole thing. 
---
https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60
---
You can definitely use a number of free guides though - vanillaguide is pretty decent, there’s a couple of people here with alliance guide projects and Joana has said he will have an alliance one published before launch too. 
---
I've made a terrible mistake... in my defence I could have sworn the app said this was posted on r/wow.
---
There are plenty of warriors on pservers that hit 60 a day after the hunters and locks.
---
The video is from retail.
---
If u want to be a real asshole, stand at the horde flightpath in felwood (bloodvenom post iirc) and mc people who land there and jump down the mountain just beside and they will have to corpserun all the way from darkshore up to felwood and then jump down to their corpse who is stuck on a ledge in the mountain below

addendum: getting ported to the deeppest spot in hyjal's lake and drowing on the way to the surface as only UDs, warlocks and engineers with a diving helmet in their bags could survive that.

This is the real tournament honestly. I remember the names of so many people from outside org on Grim Batol EU. Every now and again you'd get a naxx raider for a while and everyone would want to prove they were either a) only good at pve b) prove they could beat the best players on the server 
---
That’s me, and Umbra. We only just released our patreon last week so it’s unlikely to show on google yet.

I'd settle for a release date.

Pointless post. Are people seriously thinking the dev team would add stuff like this?

Relax dude.

its purely a private server thing as min/maxing tryhards from retail flooded them and brought the modern WoW mindset with them

you should just find a good team and stick with them then. Dungeons are way better than grinding and the reward is better as well, the blues you get in the mean time boost your xp/h as well... But again you need to choose the right dungeons. That said, BFD is not one to farm unlike deadmines for the hammer that will last you till your early 30's, then is just mona runs for better exp
---
Holy shit, that's cruel. That would make me spend multiple hours a day to find and corpsecamp you
---
100% accurate title. Not sure why I expected anything to happen. 
---
Awesome I'll give it a couple of goes, me and my buddy are going to be duo leveling from barrens onwards but getting there faster would be mega useful! 
---
 I experienced, when wow is not Fun and you watch the intro it hooks like a deathgrip... oh wait
---
Even as an Alliance player I have to say that the Horde has the cooler leadership.
---
It had the only AH because it was the hub people defaulted to, not the other way around.
---
If a paladin doing 20% less damage than your rogues in a 40 man raid makes it take 1-2 hours, you are all terrible players.
---
The simple fact is, a terrible player on a good class will cause a wipe far more than a decent player on a terrible class.
---
Unless you are literally doing 20 man split runs while undergeared, I don't buy any argument that doing 0.09% less dps (the difference of having 1 pala and 29 rogues, vs 30 rogues) will destroy your raid.
---
When you actually do some math, you might realize how silly the argument gets. 
---
I remember getting my Unstoppable Force and taking off multiple pieces of Armour and dueling my level 85 friend in Cataclysm. I didn't tell him what I had done. The entire Ventrillo burst in laughter when he lost.
---
Alliance be like:
---
&gt;[Common] Goibon uden lo
---
why would they do this? They go through all the trouble of making things just like before and you think they would add this huge modification? that s a pretty stupid assumption isn t it
---
Rolling a female dwarf just to trigger everyone
---
Is that bad? I spend many hours on that.
---
Also, donations are optional, nobody forced you to support the project.
---
This is one change classic should make, if you roll a priest you choose your racial. Otherwise everyone will be dwarf thinking they can't play othetwise.
---
&gt; Warr? Go to dance school for stances? Dunno
---
Standard lvl 10 quest for defensive stance. Then a short but cool lvl 30 quest to get berserker stance. Then a few different quests that gives equipment, which gives really nice items (whirlwind axe for example), but are a pain to do. 
---
Care to explain or link some reading on it?
---
Doing dungeons more than once for the quests is *never* better than grinding. Even for the items. Grinding can also be better xp/h than questing depending on the level and your leveling path.
---
Hairy brutal midget is looking very questionable in [Robes of the Exalted], not sure how you can enjoy this look.
---
Which is not staying ahead of the pack.. you just made my point. At best they can stay within the pack, but it's a lot harder.
---
Ignore the haters, going afk in STV or defending a capture point in AB, Shadowmeld was the fucking bomb.
---
That is way before 0.9, been fiddling around with wow since that version patch 
---
30 rogues doing some 400 dps (based on an unbuffed dps test i saw) is 12000 dps
---
And 29 rogues + a paladin doing 300 something dps is 11900 dps. 
---
If this is your reason to not bring a paladin, then you should NEVER bring a rogue over a mage, who does some 500+ dps.
---
And in full bis the paly and rogue both does some 8-900 dps, while the mage does 1300 unbuffed.
---
Rogues are literally worthless. And same for warriors. Only mages thx. 1 of each class to bring buffs and throw gear at, rest are mages. 
---
Hunters right now hitting 60 in less than 4 days, I've seen plenty of warriors do it in about 5 days.
---
The pack will not be hitting 60 in 5-6 days or anywhere close to it
---
I will give you a release date.
---
June 26.
---
Why? It is the week before FFXIV Shadowbringers release that is on Juli 2.
---
That's my guess and I don't think it's a bad guess.
---
just go to school... druids are men, everyone knows that. Where were you raised, in Stormwind?
---
It will run better than vanilla I think. We get the exact same graphic "classic" option but with the added bonus of proper multicore utilization. 
---
Depends on what you mean by the pack then. I'd assume if you're speed leveling, that the "pack" means other speed levelers. If you're talking general population, you can be ahead of the pack by just playing more than a few hours a day.
---
Only downside with ret is that they do some 20% less damage. 
---
ANd your attitude is why BFA is trash
---
Dungeon groups will always jump at a tank, doesn't matter class. Druids can definitely off-tank in raids and most casual guilds are less demanding about class spec - they're really just trying to fill out spots most of the time. Same thing with enhancement shaman, but it's less exciting because your best contribution is to auto-attack while totem twisting.
---
If you go resto, both druids and shaman are pretty equivalent in terms of how good they are at healing. Druids have more options at end-game, but they embody the "jack of all trades, master of none" cliche. Shaman have fewer options, but they're better at dishing out some damage (in short fights).
---
Your best bet is to figure out what feels best to you and go with that. If you wanna bear, bear!
---
Thats a SUPER overgeared hunter killing 1 boss, nice link.
---
If a warrior has gear to do 1k dps, a pala in equal gear does about 800. I really dont get why you exagerating this much. 
---
I think if u like hunters class fantasy more than mages you know the way to go! 
---
i fucking love this lol
---
Yes, the pack is the general population. 
---
&gt; you can be ahead of the pack by just playing more than a few hours a day
---
At launch a lot of people will be playing for extended periods of time.
---
Daaaaaayyyyyuuummm
---
Wasnt light well the very first mage table?  
---
Just spam click it to make it go away immediately just to click off the HoT/delete the food?
---
I played one for most of vanilla and I would never again pick a troll for anything, based on looks alone. The weird sickly flimsy hunchback experience just got to me in the end, at times I really hated it with a passion.
---
I moved to Orcs and never looked back since, Orcs are superior.
---
Okay here's a couple of sections I picked out for a few reasons:  
---
1 - It's from the end of the guide at level 55  
---
2 - It shows a section we streamlined extensively to condense questing  
---
3- It shows some of the travel minimisation we use
---
Please note that it is in its test draft form so the steps are quite abbreviated. We're currently scheduled to do final draft 20-40 so this section is not tidy.

hope this helps!
---
Its an age old discussion between my friend and i aswell, he was human priest and i was NE, deception is really great in 2v2 etc. but i know he cried a bit on the inside aswell every time in Battlegrounds i would shadowmeld and he would be ganked first everytime :P
---
Huh? I'm not assuming anything,  just saying I'm glad we don't have that in classic (compared to retail).
---
Relax, I never said I think they'd out this into classic, but that I'm glad that classic won't have it.
---
This is getting more ridiculous by the minute. 
---
Let the selfish RPers not on an RP server hang out by themselves. They knew what they were getting into when they decided to be a useless spec. 
---
Human - most played race - least favorite...
---
It’s either that or late August
---
Razer Orbweaver and Razer Naga Hex V2
---
You are correct.
---
I'm not sure if I'd call them bad people but they are certainly selfish. 
---
Damn, tough life xD
---
Almost yeah :p
---
Guess you're right. I've read too many braindead posts on this sub that I assumed that was where you were going.
---
I get fucking pissed when I get a ret or prot pally on my BG team. Main reason I'm going horde this time around is to avoid all the autistic pally RP players. 
---
On the contrary I am looking forward to nelfing the shit out all the haters
---
Praise be it to Hod
---
There's an absurd amount of "elitist casuals" on here lol. In a constant panic about the game being ruined if not everyone runs around like headless chickens in Barrens for 3 months like they did 14 years ago when they were 7 years old. 
---
Found the buttmad ret paladin with inferior dps.
---
The dps charts are always being topped by a hardcore fury warrior in every raid.
---
That's true. I even see threads asking to ban all addons somewhat regularly, just because _they_ didn't use them back in vanilla.
---
Ah good old Shitewell
---
My 2 cents as a vanilla raider:
---
Sure, MC, BWL and some of AQ will not be much of a challenge as it was back then. But if you wanted to do Naxx you needed that bit of strenght coming from the more proveable races/specs.
---
I dont see why its gonna be a problem though, back then there was always at least 1 or 2 guilds on your server that was famously known for being "hardcore"
---
I was in a top 5 raiding guild back then and we might not have cleared so fast as the others but it was fun. 
---
Play whatever you want but dont get angry at others if they dont accept your off spec build.
---
Find your right kind of ppl. 
---
This time we have a lot more time than 2 years to do this (hopefully), and i personally am going back to re joice in the memories that made up my teenage years so great. 
---
I agree with you, to heck with the minmaxing, and play what you enjoy the looks of. Fortunately for me, im a dwarf fan so I get the fear ward as an added bonus on top 👌
---
That EDIT mate 😂 gold 👌🏻
---
Next post: No flying cars!
---
&gt;I'm not assuming they would do it, just glad they're not.
---
Okay then.
---
Designers always underestimate the lengths players go to in order to optimize :p
---
That’s fucking evil 😂
---
Then the mages are bad, or the world buffs/consumes account for over 200 dps in power for a warrior
---
&gt; no Horde priest has Fear Ward. Therefore, Fear Ward is not needed for end game raids. 
---
It's pretty obvious that this sub is full of noobs when this can get almost 50 upvotes.
---
Ion said see you this summer
---
You're a tool, how about you're emit some positivity for once?
---
Ugh no shit. Family around me are starting to plan shit and I need to know when I can block off. 
---
Nope, I just provide raw data. I am aware ret does less dps than a rogue. As stated quite clearly. I am however also aware that those few % counts for very little unless ALL your melee are paladins.
---
Dont worry I intend to heal. Though I will also dabble in 5 man tanking. 
---
You don't fall through them any more I don't think. But they have a tendency to fuck up animation wise for some players, like instead of stopping for a while at each end it just immediately starts going as it reached the top/bottom. 
---
I think it‘s Time to Go outside a little and take some deep breaths. You seem a little too much under pressure to me. 
---
Akchually, 1 shadow priest is optimal for warlock’s overall dps.
---
1 ret pal or at least BoK is optimal 
---
Regarding balance... I don’t have a justification appart for mage fire spec Ignite... but it’s not required
---
I want my panda
---
I was thinking of a female troll when I posted that, completely forgot that males are always hunched over. That would drive me insane too, I don't think I could play a male. Females are still awesome though!
---
by the way, anyone interested in fun Druid challenges, like 5-oomkin dungeon run?
---
There will be no gear or combat style requirements, all you need is the ability to shapeshift into a moonkin for a group selfie with boss corpse.
---
Not true. Dwarf priests were considered the best by end of Vanilla too. The large difference being others were all widely accepted because most people created their character before realizing. With pservers, there was “no excuse” for someone to roll a different race
---
Probably because they're kind of a boring choice. Nothing wrong with them but they're also not very exciting next to a bunch of fantasy races.
---
Night elves are my favorite but I'm still going to roll a human at launch.
---
Literally laughed out loud. 
---
Nah, humans will still be the most played, be it because aesthetics or because some people think the spirit buff is meaningful.
---
Damn, I didn't realize it was so bad in some areas, in major cities driving for Uber is enough to live comfortably off of. I agree that begging can be incredibly lucrative with absolutely zero startup or overhead, but would a panhandler in rural NC make much money either?
---
I was in Bubbalo's guild. He was an awesome/funny dude.
---
Don't Druids get a boost when AQ and Naxx hits because of the more Druid-specific gear you can get in those raids? Tier 2.5 and things like The End of Dreams look pretty sweet.
---
Silly that's about what you'd get in full naxx gear already! 
---
You orcs will like everything you get. Even cash shop. Because you could be given nothing, and sit in your Lordaeron cages!
---
Ad hominem attacks = lose by default.
---
sure, an assumption, but some people will assume that you actually have evidence when we really have none if they will change it or not 
---
At this point, the best part of classic wow release is the death of the pre release culture. 
---
It reads like you're protesting against it, which would be fair if it was even a chance, but it's not... It kind of is a pointless post. Although I agree with you, being able to smash mobs that you gradually out level feels better. 
---
Just me and my dog.
---
Every PvP guild had a spy account. We used it all the time to camp shit talkers on forums as well as coordinate BG queues
---
My opinion is that if you're gonna create this time capsule server option that's trying to replicate the 2006 version of wow. You should be as accurate as possible to that version of wow. And that version of wow didnt have achievements so I wouldn't want to see them included in classic
---
They certainly hit like 'em.
---
At first I thought it would be a good idea to kill time and explore. Then I realised that the best thing about classic is not having to earn achievements, do dailies and such. With classic I can balance real life and in-game nolife.
---
Nope. Your character is a walking achievement list. That's all you need.
---
There are achievements in the game already:  
---
\- R14
---
\- full tier set
---
\- scarab lord
---
\- doing the 25quests long T0,5 quest line
---
\- being feared among the enemy faction for being a ruthless ganker
---
\- etc.
---
Achievements in vanilla are community driven. You make them yourself in a cohesive game world instead of "being chosen by the big metal hand in the sky" as eloquently put in WC3.
---
It would change how the game feels and i think as much as some ppl want them in Classic, Blizzard is very protective i think about keeping Classic how it felt back then.
---
I'd rather look into how I can bring back "vanilla wow" instead of slapping more features on it. It's straight up unnecesary.
---
I like where you're coming from. I too, probably wont have a lot of time to play that game with having too balance my real life 
---
check legacy player logs. most raids bring 2-3 dwarfes but they also have a lot of nelfs and humans
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Default.aspx?page=1  (just click on "naxxramas" here and check their healers)
---
That's a good shout, I suppose it could determine who joins guilds and what not 
---
Only 2 tanks..??? Huh?
---
Lul it's barely spring 
---
So I have some experience, i've tried full moonkin and its fun, starfire crits is awesome, but never as good as pyro/soulfire. Cat is also fun your opener can do great dmg but never as good as a rogue. Then you have heart of the wild build, its super versatile you can open as cat and put 3 bleeds on then go out and moonfire + insect swarm. And root em, then starfire and then charge in as bear and bash then finish them in cat. And its fun, so if you like kind of killing ppl slowly with tons of different things and kite and flag run, then its awesome. For me tho it's a lot of work and sometimes you will see a warrior charge in and kill you in 2 hits. Or a mage kill you in a pyro + fireblast.
---
 So imo if you don't like flag carrying I'd say there is always another class that will do your job better and easier. I like druids but this is the reason I won't main one in classic.
---
&gt;I've heard people praise that retail feature that adjusts the level of mobs in the zones to align it with your own
---
stop lyin, everybody hates that
---
I'm more interested in the 10% more rep racial as it shortens the horrible ZG and BG rep grinds considerably. Fear ward is nice and all but hardly necessary. It's a tool to help retarded tanks who don't know how to dance.
---
I was one of the unfortunate ones who never really got to fully experience Vanilla. I started about 4 months before TBC launch. But that does sound like a lot of fun having to make your own achievements up. 
---
NE are great shadowpriests. Starshards has a better range and spell power coefficient than mindflay. Also shadowmeld -&gt; mind control is extremely strong especially since you stay stealth for the entire cast 
---
These videos are pretty  unrealistic. Yes it happened but it's nothing done regularly. Of course there will always be that .01% that can abuse  this and that to kill a boss or two but they're outliers. The guy asking about soloing is not talking about doing it in this manner. 
---
There's like 4 bosses in the entire game that relies on taunt. That's not the issue with prot paladins, it's that they run out of mana. 
---
On fresh servers if say Ferals are better than warrior in MC, before they get their set gear. Other than maybe magmadar since he fears.
---
It's the lack of gear that is druids problem.
---
Pretty sure I was using the MirageUI add-on collection at that point - I know for sure the font was from that pack as I used that font all the way up to Legion.
---
the 1300+ dps mages are the mages with rolling ignite.. the 1 mage is getting a damage boost from all the other mages in the raid. Each and every mage is not doing 1300 dps all the time. 
---
True fact, thumbs up...!!
---
Very cool of you to respond like this. To be open in the face of criticism like you just did shows what you're made of.
---
I might be tempted to buy a guide to read on my morning/evening commute in preparation for Classic. Can you either send me your pricing model or web shop page where I can pick it up?
---
Loved your piece in the CountdownToClassic Podcast by the way, that's the nr. 1 reason I'm so positive about you/your work.
---
I exclusively played on RPPVP servers, and thats what I intended to play on once Classic released. I just assumed they would exist... Hope there is not gonna be an issue as I honestly felt that the communities of the RP servers were better then normal PVP servers.
---
The PvP Rank system is a system of competition against other players. Taking it slow isn't going to get you any high ranks
---
Lmao this the kind of dude that shops Christmas in July sales 
---
20 spirit is an advantage over fear immunity?
---
Sounds like someone has never gotten past MC.
---
&gt; It's a tool to help retarded tanks who don't know how to dance.
---
Spoken like someone who has never progressed past MC.
---
There are so, SO many fears ingame that happen more often than 30 seconds, and thus require fear ward because you literally cannot berserker rage every single one.
---
You misunderstood me, so I’ll rephrase and expand.
---
In Vanilla, raiders were well aware that dwarf priests were the best race. The difference was guilds did not punish non-dwarfs for two reasons: one, most players were not aware dwarfs were the best when they rolled their priests, so it was illogical to punish them for it; and two, with so few people knowing dwarfs were the best, there was a shortage of them — a priest of a different race was still a very valuable healer if the alternative wasn’t a dwarf priest.
---
So yes, priests of all kinds were well represented in Vanilla. With pservers, everyone knew going in dwarfs were the best, so there were both more dwarfs and less excuses for non-dwarfs.
---
That's fair enough man.
---
It's not just class though, races too.  IMO if you want the most involvement with your character's class and race lore go undead warlock.  You get all the cool undead stuff and then all the cool warlock stuff.
---
Q2 &amp; Q3 what does this mean?
---
Thanks it was kind of Josh to chat to us. It was a legit question here imo since most people wouldn’t know us from a sack of spuds. 
---
Only 1-19 released right now. We are releasing 1-60 right before launch as we’re actively refining it still, want to confirm some details on beta too. 
---
The Dwarf firing his boomstick always felt amazing to me, though I ultimately rolled an Undead back in Vanilla.
---
Yeah I've farmed Naxx for months now. Fear ward is massively overrated and you end up with raids full of dwarves because of it. Most fear effects can be dispelled and if everything goes to shit the warrior can just pop death wish and a stoneshield potion to get through it. Last couple of Naxx runs we didn't even have a dwarf at all. More and more paladins, less priests and druids. Every melee is human though, their racial actually gives them something that shows up on the meters. 
---
There are 12 months in a year. Divide by 3 and you get 4 “quarters”. 
---
Q1 is jan-mars
---
Q2 is apr-june
---
Q3 is july-sept
---
Q4 is okt-dec
---
Not in vanilla lol. 
---
I'll tell you why but it might get a little long winded.
---
Every RPG prior to WoW I played Paladins.  The versatility of being able to smite evil, toss around some minor buffs to my team and give out the "OH SHIT, everyone is dying" heal (Lay on Hands) was always really appealing.  Knights are cool and Paladins are the closest thing to a knight.  I love the armor styles commonly associated with Paladins and I like what they represent.
---
I've been joking around with the heavy pillow and only dps stuff but when I played my Paladin in classic I had a 20/0/31 spec.  I don't remember the exact spec(I tried to fill out a tree just now, lol) but I was not against throwing out a few heals here and there when shit got heavy.  I also did not mind buffing the raid as I had an improved blessing through talents I think it was Blessing of Wisdom?
---
When I hit 60 and started raiding I did not set out to be a max DPS Paladin or whatever that was.  The Agility stack Paladin with 2k mana or something laughable. I wore Plate had enough mana to dps during a fight, throw around some Flashes of Light and Lay on Hands if shit really hit the fan and in my guild it rarely did.
---
I'll give you a TLDR I guess:  Paladins are versatile and look fucking cool.
---
In raids Yeah I remember only being able to wand till 5 sunders and melee could white hit only lol.
---
Yep, my exact thoughts. No wonder there are so many "you can progression raid in naxx as ret/boomkin no problem!!!!!" posts.
---
I mean, my guild would do MC in 2 in a half with a bathroom break in between. :)
---
"If you are capable of putting in the work required to make a ret Pally a  valuable raid member then you will have a place in near any guild out there."
---
How? You can't be using more consumables than everybody else if everybody else is also using all helpful consumables and the buff limit is also a hardcap on what you can use. I raided in a not very hardcore guild on a pserver and everybody was using every consumable to their disposal.
---
Imo what you said is only true if you are in guild where almost everybody is slacking and not using consumables, but I don't think that's the norm, is it?
---
&gt;Yeah I've farmed Naxx for months now. Fear ward is massively overrated.
---
These two sentences contradict each other.
---
&gt; their racial actually gives them something that shows up on the meters.
---
Ah, so you're a meter whore who cares more about MUH DEEPZ than actually helping out the raid.
---
Gotcha.
---
I fell for the old opposite faction /duel /yield trick.
---
Basically if you're in friendly territory you could be challenged to a duel by the opposite faction. They would then /yield and you'd still attack them flagging yourself (dueling wouldn't flag you). Then they'd just kill you.
---
It sure is alot of fun and for me personally achievements are specifically game breaking.
---
When you manage to get to rank13/14 you are basically granted access to the best armor- and weaponsmiths, to the best tailors etc. your faction can offer. 
---
So by achieving something in the game it is still coherrent within the game world. Sure, it still is an RPG with pigs dropping axes and such, but it always felt odd that you ventured into some dark eery cave, merked some skeleton monster and a popups blasts in your face congratulating you on your feat.
---
Like where did this come from? Did an old god just congratulate me? Elune? Where does this popup come from?
---
This bummed me out exceedingly in Gothic3. In Gothic 2 you killed some bandits when venturing out of city and two days later you happen to talk to a merchant who wanted them long dead and then you can hand in the quest immediately as you already killed the questmobs unknowingly. In 3 you had no idea the monsters in that cave were questmobs and still the game just told you, you finished a quest and you now go collect your reward from somebody you never talked to.
---
Achievements for me personally are inconsistent with the game world and should belong to an xBox live service inwhich you can collect some gamerscores for e-peen.
---
Sorry for ranting :D
---
And there's like 10,000 DPSers who don't understand threat and without taunt would die hideously first time they pull aggro from a Paladin tank.
---
This is Blizzard. Their motto has always been we’ll release it when it’s done. 
---
For me it's got to be the human mage slinging fireballs at the infernal as he makes a last stand upon that ruined tower. 
---
The point is Fear Ward is a nice to have ability, but not an ESSENTIAL ability. What part of that did you fail to understand?
---
Ion: We ain't got no progressive stats.
---
Smokey: Damn. Y'all ain't never got two things that match. Either y'all got Progressive itemization, no stats. Fresh servers, no RPPVP. New client, no beta. Daaaamn.
---
The best priest I ever met in Vanilla (by a long margin) was a NE priest. I quit after C’thun but the guild he was with (and I very shortly) went on to clear Naxx (they were the 20th guild to do so I believe) so the hell with all this dwarf priest or nothing nonsense. 
---
He was also British playing on a NA server so bonus points I guess? 
---
no
---
The tauren smashing the dwarve's bear like its a child's birthday pinata. From that day I was sold to tauren.
---
And yet they handle it fine without fear ward. It's just not a necessity anymore because people know how to play and work the mechanics. 
---
And no I play a human warlock, hardly the most optimal class or race when it comes to meter whoring. Most of the others in the raid min-max like crazy. As I said, just about every melee is human. Every paladin is human too, not sure why though. We have one shadow priest and 1-2 disc priests and all three are human. I don't know how good the 5% spirit buff is but it doesn't sound like a lot. 
---
WTB [Robes of Insight]
---
I'm someone who wants to RP and PvP. I really hope they include this.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;the major core of the playerbase will be much more casual and give way less shits about min maxing.
---
Lets be real, the vast majority of the people that this post is concerned on behalf of will never make it to 60, and even fewer will join guilds that tackle content past MC. They'll get confused about the weird questing structure in vanilla, get upset and jaded about needing to grind for dozens of hours, get bored, and eventually leave.
---
Yes there are downsides, and yes it will happen.
---
I always enjoyed the warlock's implied lore. Stuff like how the lock trainers in stormwind are hiding in the basement of a bar. Like you need a secret knock to get into the club. 
---
Questing for the demons including the mounts are nice too.
---
Yeah, they talk about that alot on various YT channels.. I’m gonna do my best to find an celeb-clean server!
---
I even think, to an extend, that voice com can be bad for the game experience. It’s gonna thin out the zone chats, I fear...
---
The biggest problem could be harassment IMHO. Imagine this: big streamer and Randomdude are racing to get to that rich thorium vein or black lotus, or w/e. Big streamer loses, and calls for a hit on Randomdude. Now he has a ton of people griefing him for doing nothing but playing the game.
---
Can't just log on an alt, as high level alts are somewhat rare.
---
Not saying its definitely a bad thing, but having a mindless mob you can give a name to and they will collectively screw with someone who beat you at something is kind of a shitty thing to do, and I could see almost any big streamer doing it.
---
Tip: click on the lightwell!
---
It's a huge problem, especially for pvp servers. It enables opposite factions to collude. You should not be able to talk with the opposite faction. Pretty simple to understand. Imagine not being able to understand how this would affect gameplay in vanilla. The people saying they don't care either way, or say it's fine cause that's how it is in retail either A) don't play on pvp servers, and/or B) haven't played vanilla or don't understand the faction interaction.
---
There is nothing stopping people from communicating via forums or 3rd party applications. However, doing so adds extra steps which might deter the majority in doing so.
---
Also some guy said you need to accept the requests to see pertanent information: you just can't randomly add them to spy. That's true, but I'm already bnet friends with a ton of horde players who will be rolling on my server, and they have historically been some of the best players on the server; rank 1 players, server firsts, etc. This already gives me a HUGE advantage over other alliance players that don't have these guys on their friends list.
---
Unless blizz "blacks out" cross faction bnet, then I'll be able to see where these guys are, to either gank or avoid... Msg them to come kill this alliance player that's mining my zone, etc etc, very easily.
---
Cross faction communication can't be in game.
---
The thing I quoted you on is nonsense. Horde priests have different circumstances than Alliance priests, so you cannot use their situation as a complete parallel to Horde. Ever heard of Tremor totem?
---
[Just stop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrWoG8IckyE)
---
This, after seeing the tauren peacefully spread some unicorn dust over the hill in the wind sold me on leveling a tauren shaman!
---
So true. I have the luxury of only having played during 04-07, so I don't know how easy it actually got, but I can assume today's players will either 1) quit swiftly or 2) complain that it's too hard and ask Blizzard to make it easier. My hope is that they don't bend the knee for kids.
---
Hey there Ganondorf.
---
Have you ever been in a vanilla raid? Most bosses are immune to taunt. If a dps pulls aggro he's toasted unless he gets BoPed or uses a LIP. 
---
The only bosses that can be taunted are the ones that require tank swaps like Firemaw, Ebonroc and Flamegor in BWL. Paladin tanks are useless on these bosses. 
---
So much this. WoW is an M**MO**, a game centered around a huge online community and playing with other people. With the last few expansions the game was designed to empower the solo player so much so that you are referred to as a literal god amongst everyone else (the NPCs and lore in this case).
---
That said, of course a single player can't solo current dungeon/raid content. But the game isn't just about a dungeon or a raid. It's about everything else. When you have every person being able to do all of that content without relying or needing to work with others, it pretty much becomes a singleplayer game with online aspects (sort of like how Fallout 76 is). You can do everything there solo, but you might need some help with end game raids (nukes).
---
In Classic, aside from following your usual main quests and leveling up, you're just about worth another speck in the sand dunes of Tanaris. Bigger tasks feel more meaningful, getting a group together and banding with strangers to rely upon each other and overcome these tasks, be it group quests, dungeons, raids or even war parties fighting the enemy faction.
---
There was more emphasis on actual cooperation (and thus the feel of community is much more pronounced).
---
They'll all just right click report you and boom, banned
---
Dota? I kept getting auto-kicked as soon as I started download, so I downloaded it from the website, and kept getting kicked from all games anyway. The one which didnt kick me, was filled with people who left after 2 minutes.
---
Nice karma whoring, i hope he gets better but please use Xpost feature because it's really shitty of you to post on both communities wow and classicwow looking for karma.
---
Well said. I think you outline the possible issues with this the best. Hopefully we can  get some more official info about this on Blizzard's stance about it.
---
Rofl hadn't thought of this. Rip.
---
It's also about playing a game that we paid for but was taken away after a few years... borderline criminal
---
Imagine not having anything to do IRL.......
---
The Tauren sprinkling PCP over Mulgore with that harp/flute/whatever in the background gives me shivers every time.
---
Those are from private servers, though.
---
The vast majority of money making methods don't require you to have a DPS spec. Some of the richest guys on a server might be prot warriors or resto shamans etc.
---
Hi, /u/juni_jo
---
Iirc frost mage does around 1-1.1k so it holds true regardless. 
---
I didn't think of that either, but that's totally possible lol 
---
100% retail. The video is pre TBC look at the upload date. I mained a hunter in retail Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath, and this video was a big deal back then.
---
That is no changes. It broke on cast start in 1.12.
---
Sending my best wishes to your father
---
Hope you’d have a great time playing too! 😁
---
He specifically mentioned Hunters soloing Scholo and that he played a Hunter in retail Vanilla. As a Hunter main myself, I naturally assumed this was exactly what he was talking about.
---
It’s their game, they can moderate it however they choose to. I’ve seen the absolute garbage spewed on pservers and considering just how toxic gaming *can* and *has* become, I have no issues with curbing this behavior ruthlessly.  I’m way too old for kids to think it’s neat to use racial epithets and other crap in general chat channels. 
---
That crap is not okay.
---
Oh man clearing MC in 30 mins so much fun, glad I waited a week to breeze through all the content and spend as little time as possible raiding with my guildmates.
---
Divide by *4* and you get 4 quarters.
---
Eh. It depends what you want. You're sacrificing a fair amount of melee dps by putting it on a warrior. It's a +ev move to let a Shammy use it, because they aren't expected to be high dps, plus you give the player the fulfillment of being able to play the class they want. Consequently, they are more likely to play at an optimal level vs. a warrior who doesn't want to be carrying Nightfall in the first place.
---
It was definitely around in classic, as I remember the constant moaning coming from my fellow horde players about how alliance was easy mode because they had paladins and dwarves.
---
Hahaha
---
Okay
---
You’re defending for a very small minority here. I’m willing to bet that 95% of players have any clue what the offensive speech punishments are...because they don’t use offensive speech.
---
Frankly, if you feel like you need to enter a fantasy world of elves and orcs, but STILL drop n-words, I don’t give a shit how strict the rules banning your character are. If you need to get some toxic convo out of your system, there will be unmoderated Discord for that...but let me get AWAY from the nastiness of the real-world, please.
---
Pewdiepie defense squad inbound 😴
---
So.... shutting down an illegal private server was a mistake. 
---
You do realize whatever conspiracies or politics were involved, and no matter how popular, it is fully with in Blizzard’s rights to protect their IP however they choose, right?
---
LFM MOLTEN CORE LINK ACHIEVE
---
Nooooope
---
dont be that guy
---
????
---
people unironically think there will be mafias on classic, lol
---
This implies the streamer wont be ganked 24/7 the second they leave the safe zone
---
They won't narrow it down now, it was already narrowed. They'd just piss everyone off.
---
We'll get a date soon, hold tight.
---
Tryhards dont care about resources like money or time. If they can push out higher numbers, they will just to prove they are better.  Regardless of whether better is necessary or not. 
---
Lmao. 
---
However, I hope you’re right. 😢
---
imagine the consequences for unknowingly ganking a popular streamer
---
This comic is depressing
---
Lmao 
---
If you have not done so yet, be sure to sign and share the petition I have set up several weeks ago. We are over 600 signatures now, but we need more of course to create the noise needed!
---
The petition can be found here: https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases
---
This was posted a day or two ago, already. 
---
Gonna blast my speakers for a good couple minutes with the login menu banger so the neighbours know wassup.
---
I had a similar-ish experience on a server that shall not be named. Got an Alliance character to cap so I could suss things out for when I rolled a paladin in official Classic. Well, it was fun and all, but I went to make a Horde character and look around old Orgrimmar for the first time in years and that was the end of *that* idea. No amount of Alliance racials or pally blessings can tempt me, Horde is where the heart is and I, too, am looking forward to coming home.
---
I am not sure why people are thinking about fear ward from a PvE perspective. All this minmaxing, as well as a fear ward, is extremely helpful in PvP, that's where you need it.
---
Sodapoppin actually right click reported someone for "stealing" a copper node from him in a demo. On stream.
---
You can strafe back and forth on top of the target to spam backstab. It's tedious but quite easy.
---
Blizzard has always given out the release date about a month and a half out for all of their titles.
---
Why would Classic be any different?
---
Good comment. The private servers already showed me how nasty and toxic the general chat can get, no doubt same would happen in classic without moderation.
---
I'd settle for a release date of the release date 
---
That feeling when I go "LOL shitpost" but then I subsequently go "... please though"
---
Sure, and some people will assume that LFR will be in and guild banks will be in. 
---
I can't educate everyone
---
I don't think there's a gray area, you are either a boomer or aren't a boomer, and this never changes.
---
screw the haters, I loved the Lightwell in Vanilla and TBC. Too bad no one used it properly (the hot cancelled when you take any damage and you can consume all the charges by spamming click it). But when a DPS used it responsibly to heal himself and save you mana on a boss fight, it felt godly.
---
It's the 3rd week of June, I have a work trip that week so it's guaranteed 
---
seems legit
---
Not only their right but duty.  If a company does not persue and enforce their copyright, etc they lose the legal ability to.  So if Blizzard did not want to lose their own game to public domain they MUST.
---
I don't know how I haven't seen a post like this yet. I never thought about some of the negatives that streaming could bring classic. Im sure it wont be game breaking but man all the ideas in here are possible and would really suck if they started happening.
---
You’re very right. Do you know how many companies would sell their first-borns so they could generate (~8,000,000 players * $15) *every month* for half a decade? 
---
If you owned that IP, I think you’d be a little protective too.
---
thats a private server bug. wont be possible in classic
---
I too remember constant moaning on Alliance on how Frostshock/Windfury is BS.  When my guild rerolled to Horde later on a new server there were less complaints TBH but still occasionally the "Blessing of Freedom is stupid",etc.  We had pretty good tanks so stance dancing wasn't much of an issue.
---
Someone’s living in a dream world. 
---
The eyes of the earth mother rest on him. Worry not.
---
Glad you are getting better responses than I did. I posted a couple days ago about how min maxing had the potential to bring a lot of negativity to the game and I got eviscerated. Lol
---
r/classicwowcirclejerk
---
Also likely because Naxx had no fear based encounters and AQ40 only had it on bug trio which generally was an easy fight anyway.
---
As long as we had 2-3 dwarf priests we were pretty set in vanilla and didn't care at all what the other priests were racially, because the player had way more of an impact than the race at that point.  If your guild only had 0-1 dwarf priest and were working on nef though ... any non-brain dead dwarf priest would be in high demand.
---
It’s stuff like this that makes me think sometimes that maybe... maybe I don’t really want the pserver communities in Classic. This mentality is just... misguided. 
---
My dad works at Blizzard and says there won’t be a beta and the game will release September 23 on the very last day of summer. 
---
We'll get it when its done, announcing a date won't speed up development or make the wait anymore bearable.
---
Kaivax: Bye, Felicia.
---
It would have been a thing in classic if it were practical. No one knew what was important when the game started, and by the time you were decked out in BWL gear and starting Naxx and realizing "fuck I wish I were a dwarf" you had enough gear and other stuff that re-rolling would be stupid as hell and so that only happened when people wanted to change their class.
---
Time was also a huge part of min-maxing in vanilla. People didn't buff up for everything because the time and effort was better spent in the dungeon and you couldn't get 40 people together with unlimited time back then so you used buffs where they were important.
---
Agreed. It really isn’t a big deal. But if you don’t care about the aesthetic, you should play a dwarf. If you do care, then you should play a human or NE and I strongly suspect there will be enough dwarves to make your decision irrelevant to your play experience.
---
By your logic, he’s the one who actually waits until Christmas to do his Christmas shopping. It’s literally spring, and you’re shitting on him for correcting the other guy’s slight exaggeration.
---
Wiping on piss easy mechanics of MC is not fun too. You certainly want to breeze through asap. Maybe Majordomo or Rag deserve some wiping.
---
Every. Single. One.
---
Also desperate prayer is pretty good, which I think both humans and dwarves have.
---
Ah, nvm then. Thanks
---
Ask people to clarify what they are reporting for and add a 
---
 harsh punishment for people who abuse the system and it should work out fine.
---
Same. Rerolled my lvl17 Human Paladin to a Dwarf in 2005, just for the aesthetics, and never looked back.
---
My dad works there too and he's gonna beat up your dad at work next week.
---
Same man! That scene just felt too real. At that time having graphics being able to see each hair in the fur was epic. And the small snort he makes while shaking. Chills!
---
Are you implying my female dorf is not pleasing to the eye?
---
Ret paladin is a lvling build, prot is a build for aoe farm mobs and holy is for Raids and efficient PvP. All specs have their own use.
---
I know it's crazy right? There are people with over 1000 days played you can find in Google all over, yes that's 24000 hours. 
---
I wasn’t, but...
---
Another thing to note is the extreme faction imbalance on that server the streamers are playing on. Most of their fans will role as whatever faction the streamer chooses which could lead to pretty bad balancing. 
---
Always go dagger rogue, it is pure class fantasy
---
&gt; announcing a date won't speed up development
---
But it will speed up the waiting, if we cut that last 7 days at work or holidays.
---
No i know. I cant wait for that slowed down pace again. When you can actually take your time in dungeons. 
---
Why does everyone always say this? It's not true. 
---
SURVIVAL HUNTERS REPRESENT
---
GONNA TOP DPS THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH NAXX
---
Have you seen a nelf?
---
Bruh I’m playing a dwarf hunter and rolling around guns only because that’s how I want it . Ain’t no minmaxer gunna tell me otherwise. 
---
lolwell
---
There are a tremendous amount of things about the game and gaming world that are so different from when vanilla was a thing that are going to make it different. This is definitely one of them.
---
nice low quality thread, right back to mmo-champion with you
---
You just got knocked da fuck out! Love Friday, too bad the sequels didn't measure up. 
---
Doing MC with offspecs/meme-builds is fun. Once. Then it turns to a fucking drag and you want to gouge your eyes out when things go haywire and QSR goes to an enhancement shaman. Trust me. It’s repeating content with offspecs that causes problems, not completing it. Just takes forever.
---
Tbh, the very first opening shot of the dwarf with his bear overlooking Ironforge. But the undead warlock is a close second.
---
When did the client start utilizing more than a single thread?
---
As long as I can ignore people, I don't need a GM to 'rescue' me from bile-spewing nincompoops. The more people they offend who do the same, the harder their life gets, assuming the server is not largely populated by similar types.
---
You may as well get mentally prepared for it. The pserver tryhard community is not only coming in force, but they’re going to be telling everyone about it. (Insert  the old vegan/CrossFit joke here 😒) 3 days into Classic: *“Dude, Ur a bad hunter. have played Vanilla hunter for 7 years. My other toon is T3”*
---
They will PST NE Priests and say “*u should reroll, ne priest bad.*” or “*LF3M VC, need tank*” and then reject anyone who isn’t a Warrior. God help you if you make it to 60 and try to PUG if you’re not a “viable” spec. 
---
Your best bet will be to befriend every decent person you come across, because you’ll need them all in the end to find 40 people for a raid. Find or start a guild of chill players who don’t have the time for the no-life communities.
---
Either way, to quote a movie from 1994, “be prepared.”
---
At least you could then bring the player not the class.
---
Oh no a whole 5 months! 
---
If a raid only brings 1 ret paladin along with full meta DPS they are minmaxers according to this sub. Oh, and ret does less than 80% of rogue DPS.
---
The aquatic form quest is insane if you don’t get any help 
---
That sexy Judgement gear on a sexy dwarf.
---
Entire servers are going to be populated by streamers and those vierwers will play the same faction as the streamers. Which is why sodapoppin has said that he is trying to find other streamers and go the opposite faction of them so that there will be a faction balance. Asmongold is the only person that would come close to sodapoppin in streamsnipers in wow, but sadly asmon is a pussy and will play on a pve server. So soda has to find multiple streamers now. 
---
But this will in the end result in about 10 servers dedicated to streamers and their fans, the rest of the servers will not be harmed by streamers. 
---
The flips make it all worth it
---
OK I get it, you have a certain idea of what a paladin is.
---
However for your second time in Vanilla why would you try to put a square peg in a round hole ? You did it the first time, it was easier because nobody knew anything about the game, but now it's much more min-maxed.
---
You could make things more enjoyable by either playing the class like Blizzard intended or play another class that would give you more fun.
---
Since you don't want to be a "healbot" why not a fury warrior ? If you go horde you can even DPS with a 2 hander, thanks to windfury totem. OK you won't have heals (do bandages count ? :D ) but at least you will do useful damage and be able to tank if you want to.
---
This is your obstinacy to revisit the same "pains" that I don't understand.
---
——&gt;&gt;&gt;MERTRIGIS CAST LIGHWELL&lt;&lt;—— CLICK IT 4 HEALZ OR DIE!!! &gt;:D
---
Good ole’ vanilla 
---
I wondered what happened to "stick and stones might break my bones but words will never harm me"?
---
When I was in school and you got bullied the only way to get out of it was getting stronger physically and get a thick skin mentally. And it helps if you developed it early rather then later, or never in some cases...
---
To me, how a person speaks tells alot of how he/she is. Comedy and satire requires at least an understanding of society and how interaction works in it. It requires intelligence for sure. On the other hand just blatantly spewing racist slurs or insulting a minority tells me that person hasn't get the whole big picture of humanity and doesn't have the EQ to understand someone's elses life.
---
Freedom of speech is something I hold dear to myself and I think it is the cause of alot of innovations in the world. Living in a society where everyone's opinion can be heard is living in a progressive country. 
---
If Blizzard would limit the freedom of speech in its virtual world maybe it should rethink in what world it became a company. 
---
Spamming is obviously hindering playing the game, but saying that my mom is fat and ugly isn't at least for me. I just know to avoid that person, and if I can't find a tank I'll even ask him to tank scholomance.
---
Oh, no doubt I had one on my dwarf hunter. No reason to not use it if it is available

---
many big streamers roll on PvE servers so going for PvP is a easy way to avoid them and their cancerous followers
---
Every class had a lvl 50 quest, it involves going to Sunken temple. 
---
It would offer a  selection of 3 items. Iirc, warr went with helm or trink, mage n priest took wand, warlock took staff or trinket etc 
---
This is cope. 
---
It is so nice!
---
you're right... i need to step up my speaker game before classic hits...
---
Help me understand. There are 4 seasons in the year. There are 365 days in a year. That’s ~91 days per season.
---
It’s 6 April. The first day of spring was 20 March. Spring has been here for 17 days.
---
17 out of the ~91 days and people are saying “it’s almost summer”? Huh?
---
Also, to your  22 June point ... the first day of summer in 2019 is 21 June. “Midsummers day” is 24 hours into the season? 😂 
---
I always had comedy central on my tv while i played. Good times when all raiding required was pressing one button.
---
Have they actually said this? I know they have addressed a lot of specific topics but I don't recall this being one. I know they are trying to be true to Vanilla, but given how they are trying to put in sharding and loot trading (yes they want back on this one but it is still going to be in the game to a small extent!), so I would be more comfortable if they actually came out and said it. 
---
I tried to keep it as simple and general as possible though :D
---
Well, maybe vanilla isn't for you then. Current retail WoW is very much "bring the player not the class", maybe you could try that!
---
Click the damned lightwell!
---
shadowmeld + mind control is the real end game
---
Good to know somebody else feels this way. I really enjoyed BC, but with the release of Wrath, it started to not feel like WoW anymore. It kind of sucks when an online game like this evolves into a former shadow of itself. 
---
Nah, everyone listened to their own music. I just put out some lists of what was popular. I pulled a bunch of music from other people’s pvp videos from back in the day. Drakedog immediately comes to mind. There was also a combat rogue that I grabbed a bunch of stuff from, but i dont remember their name.
---
I have the biggest mouth so my friends always play where I play. But this is a good thing since Im also the biggest addict and they always quit long before Im done. 
---
It's not a legal system.  It's terms od use.  And Blizzard is a private business, Warcraft is not concidered the "public square".
---
So your saying before 1.12 it didn't break on cast start?
---
Having some of the pre-1.12 stuff around would be nice. 
---
Unbuffed preraid bis does 10-20% less than a rogue. According to a 4 minute sigletarget dps test.
---
Real numbers will be found within a day of the simmers getting access to the beta. So we'll just have to see
---
But imagine the satisfaction of ganking a streamer and having 10k people witness it
---
I think most fans rather gank the streamer than help them. Unless the streamers sends his army after you. Than you just have to wait out the storm.
---
And in reality, unless you are in a hardcore raiding guild, you aren't forced to do anything....and I guarantee 99% of people bitching about being "forced" to play a race they don't like for the racial perk are not hardcore raiders and never have been. A human or nelf priest who knows their class and plays well is infinitely superior to someone who rolls a dwarf priest but is trash at the class and game.

Ingame music exscusively until 60, at least!

I play undead mage pretending to be that undead warlock. Undeads are by far the coolest race out there.

Depents where on earth you life.. it is always summer in some form somewhere.

So all we know is 2019 and we hope they mean northern hemosphere summer.

Everyone always says this because it's true. It does not matter that it doesn't make "logical sense." It matters that that's how the law works. Examples of patents lost to the public domain for lack of protecting them include aspirin (IIRC) and the Murphy Bed. 
---
There are also examples of advertisements from Xerox (\~35 years ago) that were phrased so as to encourage people to only say they were "Xeroxing" something if it was made on a Xerox machine. Everything else was just a photocopy. This was done specifically to protect their IP.
---
Pretty sure the other person has to accept your friend request to become bnet friends. You can still add individual characters without them knowing, but I don't think that works cross faction. 
---
Ah yeah. That was added in a pretty late patch I think. 
---
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
---
Remember that av will be shorter now. When they changed av farming honor became incredibly easy. I was also in a PvP guild where people would literally quit bgs when we entered so we'd get hundreds of wins in a week. High warlord almost wouldn't be worth it with how raid content was released back then though 
---
Be prepared for how obnoxiously loud guns were compared to now. 
---
You're pretty close here.  You definitely want to do 2/3 imp hamstring, 5/5 axe spec, 4/5 two hand and 2/2 imp overpower.
---
Crit is quite literally what makes or breaks a warrior.  What you wield prior to getting axe spec points is kind of up to what you can get your hands on, but once you hit that break point, you just want axes.  If you aren't critting, your dmg will be minimal.
---
You should just remove 1 point from 2 handed weapons spec and put it on are spec. Rest looks good as is.
---
I’m a libertarian for the most part.
---
Let people say whatever they want and if somebody gets reported enough, a GM intervenes and takes decisive action. That’s how I would handle it. 
---
There are mute functions, use them. If the guy is doing something in game like tagging your mobs or something illegal, report him, mute him, open a ticket against him. 
---
Be a bigger person and deal with the troll. This isn’t rocket science people. Log off for 6 minutes. Lol 
---
Sorry, you are right.  I meant Trademark, not copyright.  There is a difference.  But generalizing to IP instead of specifically copyright isn't correct either.  It also depends on if the thing you are going after is located someplace that will respect your copyright/trademark/ip anyway.  I'm sure we can all think.of countires that have lax rules and don't respect the laws where the work is protected.
---
Exactly. I play wow to relax an enter another world. Hearing slurs and politics and all that crap is just so annoying. I really don't want to hear it.
---
Why shouldn’t they? I couldn’t care less about lore or visuals so the racial is the only thing that matters to me. I don’t get why you insist on controlling other people’s gaming experience.
---
I'm quite sure the people in our raiding guild were happier and had more fun than those hardcore guilds forcing you to play a spec you don't enjoy or wanted to play.
---
We had retris, a feral tank, rogues that didn't spec combat a lot of hunters etc. And the guild did half of naxx (I only joined once in a while after aq40 since I played mostly PvP after bwl).
---
We all had fun and had no issues wiping once or twice more.
---
They only have the 1.12 data
---
Its too general and not long enough.
---
Solid.
---
As someone who has bought multiple $2000+ USD laptops for gaming; DON'T. Laptops are not worth the money, let me say that again, Laptops are not worth the money.... one more time for good measure, Laptops are not worth the money. That being said invest in a proper desktop PC with Intel/Nvidia hardware. Avoid AMD and Radeon. 
---
Probably the best way I made gold on my Prot Warrior was when I bought the plans for Steel Weapon Chain off the AH for 1g. I was the only Horde player who had it. Sold them for 25-30g a pop to PvP players. One guy bought 20 of them at 25g each. Bought me a few nice upgrades. 
---
Also, just a life tip: when someone is taking their time to educate you on a real concern that is plaguing society, maybe not hang yourself up on technicalities, trying to defend a faceless corporation because it hurts your sense of pride. There's no shame in educating yourself.
---
Lack of interaction and they killed the elitist mentality.
---
I don’t see a point of investing in a video game of you have the same gear and progression as that of an idiot.
---
I loved inspecting people back in the day and legit being impressed by their gear and being jealous. They were in a better guild, more committed and probably better at the game.
---
&gt;A good tank or healer should never have issues of doing dungeon farm runs, quite the contrary, those roles are often highly in demand and can increase their gold generation significantly if played well.
---
I already heard about this, but what would be a concrete example of what a Warrior tank and a Holy Pally could farm together?
---
MC is a three second cast. With latency and the destealth animation it'll still cover half of that. Oddds are you'll get it off vs most players.
---
You are a repulsive asshole
---
I agree with some things and disagree with others.
---
The concept of "guilty until proven innocent" is definitely an obvious problem. There has to be a human element involved when it comes to policing people, along with a level of transparency.
---
What I disagree with is that it's somehow impossible to know what is or isn't offensive speech. I always feel like whoever is making this claim is just playing dumb. We're all adults and unless you have serious emotional development issues, you know exactly what's offensive and what hate speech is. There is of course some nuance, and some things *can* be misinterpreted, but not at a level that most people claim.
---
The main point that I always want to make when we discuss policing online games is that players tend to give the developer way too much credit. It's become a recent trend for companies to say that they just can't afford positions like moderators, community managers, etc. What they mean to say is that they can easily afford them, but the ROI% isn't as high as other investments. 
---
In other words, they're okay with pulling money out of these categories because even though it'll have a negative impact on the product, they're less likely to lose money on it. A lot of studios can't even approve ROI neutral improvements to their games nowadays. There's been a clear shift in the gaming industry from making the *best* product to making the most *profitable* product.
---
It's not just gaming of course. Customer support has been cut over time through pretty much every industry.
---
So is Blizzard's argument that they can't afford customer service valid? Well, they could make the same argument about anything: Sorry, we can't afford to remove the cash shop. Sorry, we can't afford to do x thing that will make classic more accurate. The difference is that these sorts of announcements would cause a sizeable backlash from the community. 
---
But players just have a hard time understanding and appreciating the value that a solid customer support team adds. And this has been getting eroded away for a long time, so really only people who played online games in the late 90s and early 2000s remember what it's like to get a human response to a support ticket within minutes of submitting it.
---
For a real life example, there would be riots if our governments announced that they would stop funding roads or fire departments. But if they announced that they would be dissolving law enforcement agencies, people would be partying in the streets. There are a lot of people who would gladly throw away their own personal security because there's always that looming yet illogical fear that someday *they* could become the ones targeted.
---
Anyways, my point is that I think Blizzard and many other companies are doing their own players a real disservice by slashing customer support staff. But, there isn't enough of an outcry so they get away with it.
---
you mean solo grinding as a warrior? before whirlwind or level 40 I hardly think its better exp/h, and not for the quests as well, if you have a good 5 man team you can fast farm monastery and that is a lot of exp as well, early in deadmines with a good and dedicated team at level 21 you can do 35 - 40 mins run for 8k exp at least and have a chance for upgrades, that you will use up to your 30's.
---
I do believe however that grinding after whirlwind is a lot better tho, but like you said as well, depends a lot of leveling path.
---
Grinding shit feels so boring tho 10/10 would never do that solo again lol
---
you can definitely beat all the content without having racials in mind, it just makes the bosses easier.
---
you can forego a lot of the minmaxing in fact. the difference will just be between clearing AQ40 on the first week after release versus progressing for 2 months to finally kill c'thun. my experience is that people generally don't like to wipe, and especially not becquse of somebody else's fault. so while going towards minmaxing bears the risk of burning out your players, going the casual road bears the risk of the good players abandoning your guild.
---
there isnt a better (hardcore) and worse (casual) route to raiding. there are just different routes, and both have their advantages, disadvantages and risks associated by it.
---
What I’m looking forward to most is purely interacting with people from my own realm for dungeons. I can’t stand the cross realm crap anymore. 
---
People are such assholes when they’re not on your realm.  There is also no accountability what so ever, no reknown or personal reputation involved or a sense of community. 
---
To me WOW wasn’t just a game to burn time . It was a community in where I met new people and had fun hanging out and building relationships. 
---
How? Becuase a dude is karma whoring? And posting on multiple subreddits the same post but different names? Okay sorry for calling out someone for being scummy.
---
Some of us play dwarves because they're the most amazing race in Azeroth. I like my beer like I like my women...
---
A good post should be like a girls skirt.   Long enough to cover everything, but short enough to keep my attention.
---
This post is amish 
---
It’s the same name, their account is a year old and basically only has posts asking for advice on her fathers cancer. You are a truly atrocious, miserable scumbag. 
---
I used to camp by it as ranged and just click when needed.
---
Chickens double D!!!
---
Probably the most well-known private server Warrior player (monkeynews) talked to tipsout about how the improved hamstring ends up being worth it leveling on a PvP server because that single time the hamstring wins you a 1v1 (pretty damn often in my experience at low levels) is like 5+ minutes saved running back and resurrecting, which outweighs most other talent points. It really seems to be worth the 2-3 points, assuming the proc rate is the same on retail, based on the 3 warriors I've leveled on PvP servers.
---
#nochanges
---
The problem is that ret is not even bottom tier dps, it’s noticeably lower than bottom tier, even with a perfect rotation. It’s like trying to dps in a tank spec, but without any of the mitigation benefits.
---
Feral Druid for example, can become middle tier dps. With crowd pummelers and good gear of course, but a ret pally can’t even obtain passable dps.
---
Unbridled Wrath is just a personal preference of mine. It's useful in every situation whereas Booming Voice is too situational for 2 classes (that will sneak up on me unnoticed most of the time regardless if I talented or not lol)
---
BuT tHaTs SeLf HeAliNg!  NoT mY jOb!
---
No i am not i said i hope they get better but whatever you say just asked them to use the cross post feature because it is really shitty of them to multi post for karma. I get it is a horrible situation and i hope the best just don't be that ass hole on reddit and only post for gold and karma. Because that is what this looks like.
---
Feel the Boomkin; be the Boomkin.
---
Not sure how this is controversial but they sounded way cooler back then. I don’t play retail so I don’t even know how they sound now
---
The best healers place it in the fire.
---
You hope they get better from his terminal cancer? Maybe read the post. The only asshole in this situation is you. 
---
booming voice instead of unbridled wrath is better, since as arms you wont be having many auto attacks during a fight compared to fury, and you can save rage since your shouts will last longer.
---
[Cranius: Don't Make Me Get My Main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR7FC-h0Fb8) 
---
That's the first thing that came to mind
---
I see, it's pretty much decided then. Thanks! 
---
Just so we're clear on this: All of the current "theories" on when classic will launch are entirely false. The truth us that it will launch whenever you least expect it. 
---
*SO* If we could all agree to not expect it to drop May 1st that would be great.
---
A fury warrrior or a rogue with a healer can do dm east jump runs. 
---
BRD would be a good place depending on what route you take. 
---
You will most likely need a dps if you go with a prot warrior and a holy paladin.
---
You don‘t have to feel adressed by my post. Imagine someone very interested in playing anything „not viable“ or not 100% meta but is forced to play a meta char because he wants to play progression raiding. Those should feel adressed
---
For me. It is about nostalgia. I played this game at its peak through vanilla and B.C. I mained a resto/feral Druid though vanilla. I was marshal Pvp Druid I the best PvP group on our server. I also A grouped end game raids as my guild too resto Druid healer all the way to Naxx. My first character had 100+ play time over 70,000 HKs and over 180 epics. This is all just in Vanilla. 
---
To achieve all of that and play at a high level in both end game PVE and elite Pvp I had to play near 20 hours a day during some months. Especially when we’re grinding out WSG from 7am to as late as 1-3 am for weeks on weeks at a time. 
---
I was freshly out of high school, had a good part time job, no bills and no responsibilities, so I could afford the time. 
---
Now, I am 32, I have a wife, a mortgage, a successful high paying job, a small business and I am starting a second small business. I literally will not have the time to play the way I did before and because of that I will be playing purely for nostalgia.
---
That all being said. I have a decent amount of vacation time saved up right now and I am toying with the idea of taking it so I can power level to 60 ASAP but I am also torn by that idea because originally leveling to 60 was some of the best times. I do however know after all these years of playing casually on and off that leveling doesn’t have the same feeling as it did the first time. It’s quite like losing your wow virginity and now you just want to get to the end game as fast as possible.
---
Anyway, just the ramblings of a sleep deprived NE Druid who still believes those were the best times I’ve ever had.  
---
This!
---
/camp "to make a campfire"
---
I mean who the heck makes a logoff command out of "camp"???
---
&gt;  Maybe read the post. The only asshole in this situation is you. No one of any consequence cares about karma.
---
Ehhhh whatever man sorry they are dying. But other than that just don't karma whore quit being a white knight.
---
OK. In what Raid is fear ward so essential? Remember, it has a 3 minute cooldown and a 3 minute duration. And during those 3 minutes will protect against a SINGLE fear effect. Now contrast that to Berserker Rage which is a warrior ability that will BREAK an existing fear effect and provide immunity for 10 seconds. And additionally, has a cooldown of only 30 seconds. As for the Tremor totem and Will of the Forsaken, you can ignore them since Alliance doesn't have them. So Alliance has the Fear Ward which can be on only 1 target and as mentioned earlier, the warrior (tank) ability of Berserker Rage handles the fear issue quite nicely.
---
Well I don’t know if it will be the „vast majority“ that will never even make it to 60 but a good chunk for sure.
---
They will send their army to every corner of the globe. You think you'll be safe AFKing in Ironforge? Think again!
---
Lol sorry I disturbed you from you extremely successful twitch career. 
---
I still think druid is perfect for people like me who get easily bored of doing one thing.
---
I have tried leveling a few different classes to 60 (Rogue, Mage, Warlock, Paladin and Shaman) and only the druid made it to 60. The others bore me to death by the time I am 40-50 or so.
---
That is why I am super excited to play druid again in Classic. I get why some people do not enjoy that type of playstyle but for me it is close to perfect.
---
Shaman is pretty fun tho and will probably be my alt for Classic.
---
Appreciate it brother! 
---
If there is stream footage; it's not hard to file a ticket for abuse/harassment.
---
Consequences? Logging off and leveling an alt for 10 minutes then relogging?
---
How are druids at farming?
---
There's "tough" and then there's just "braindead".
---
Damn boomer chill 
---
Even as someone who also loved Lightwell, it was just utter garbage until sometime in Cata when they finally buffed it to be useful....but still required people to click on it.
---
As a Wrath baby, I got a glimpse of vanilla WoW and then lost it. And you know what? I miss Wrath. Not because of the new QoL feautures it added, but because I remember how social the game was even back then when compared to today. So suffice to say I’m excited for Classic, because the increased need for social interaction will lead to even better memories!
---
Oof 
---
C'mon don't be lazt
---
Unbridled is just personal preference for me, I did experiment with booming but I honestly didn't feel any difference, 3 mins instead of 2 is not essential as I am used to just refreshing often and the range increase is just way too situational to me.
---
As long as you time Piercing Howl right rogues and druids shouldn't be particuilarly problematic in my experience.
---
Top bar looks like FuBar to me, could be wrong though. Not seen/used FuBar since 2010. 
---
Pandaren women have dwarven women beat!
---
For me it's my character making slow progress. If I want to start a new character I have to go through that same slow progress again, there are no shortcuts.
---
Nice
---
It's a channeled dot so yeah it cannot crit. RIP your fat crits dreams!

---
Frost mages don’t do 1k DPS what are you smoking?
---
What is the theme in the first part?
---
If you stay feral good. 
---
If you have to respec feral to farm then it’s not so great. 
---
Playing an end game Druid in vanilla means you will
---
Raid resto druid. 
---
If you want to farm you will most likely have to pay to respec to farm and respec back to raid. Respecting is expensive in vanilla. 
---
I did it a lot in vanilla because we raided so much and I loved feral that It took me insanely long to get my epic mount. I probably had 100 epics before I had an epic mount. 
---
Paying for repairs and respecs will keep you pretty broke. 
---
Save diligently.
---
That's great to hear, druid is my kind of guilty pleasure, but I care too much about dps and min/maxing in pve. I'll probably have a druid alt. 
---
But I agree druid never gets boring or repetitive.
---
Even if you go full tryhard with world buffs and consumes, you'll still struggle to do half the DPS of a warrior/rogue/mage/warlock.
---
What? No. Shamans are really popular, and as a class right after warriors. Even if there relatively more holy priests than resto shamans, they would still outnumber priests.
---
I guess the sweet spot of ages will be roughly 25-33 years old.
---
This is how I know that nobody actually read all of this. 
---
&gt; This leads to confusing and pointless discussions, like the one I had with this GM. I made a few dark humor jokes on general chat, one of which was, “First black people get the right to vote, now they are introducing dark iron dwarves, what is the world coming to?” The GM told me this is offensive. I responded that I am a black South African and I am merely celebrating the introduction of color into the game. Which is, not true, although I am a South African, I am not black, but I wanted to illustrate the potential difficulties you can have.
---
Dude, just shut the fuck up and don’t play the game. 
---
You want to be a victim so bad, but this kind of conversation just makes you a complete asshole. 
---
No, it’s not OK, and I’m disappointed the GM didn’t just permaban you and move on. I definitely would have before going the water cooler to laugh about it with a coworker. 
---
Remember that this also means there is 7 shamans that need on every same item that you do. 
---
I selected 1-2 months playing about 12-20 hours a week, I felt like maybe my answer was a bit quick, but 1-2 weeks, lol 
---
Great point, but I’d rather see items dropping and getting distributed than hoping somebody sits out or “Hey, we’re full on hunters right now. If a spot opens up, I’ll give you a whisper.” 
---
Lol 
---
Classic Wow Is a great thing to stream. Is it tho?
---
Is it funny to watch a dude scraping its way through gnolls while levelig or spamming frostbolt for an entire raid? Or is it something you would just keep on a second screen?
---
I feel like, in general, a second screen will be pretty mandatory to endure Classic because don't come to me to say that the grind is particularly entertaining.
---
But also demands lockrocks
---
This problem is really only applicable to Priests.
---
For every other class, it really doesn't matter what race you are, the differences are minimal. But for Priest, you get these unique racial spells, and Fear Ward is just insanely powerful throughout all of vanilla for both PvE and PvP.
---
With an Alliance Priest, you kinda are forced to play Dwarf because if you don't, you're seriously gimping yourself. Starshards is garbage, Human +5% spirit is garbage, Perception is only marginally useful in PvP, same with Shadowmeld. In terms of overall usefulness, Fear Ward is king by a large margin.
---
Freedom of speech is not absolute, however and you’re missing the point... it’s Blizzard’s property, if they don’t want someone calling someone else a racial epithet, then guess what, they don’t have to.
---
Also, someone who trots out the “stick and stones can break my bones” trope, then you clearly have never known someone who’s been a victim of bullying or harassment. 
---
Anonymity on the internet has allowed and even encouraged some of the most vile and despicable behavior in people and again, as I said before, that shit is *not* okay. 
---
The spirit buff in disc is much more useful 
---
I will have a druid ALT that is feral.  He will tank 5 man dungeons (maybe an AQ20 / ZG here and there), farm mats, and be an herbalist / miner.  I love druids but have decided they are on alt status because some of the issues listed above.  
---
I can play all day at work and all night at home. Vacation time, pay. When we figure out release day I'm going to try and pick up some more shifts!
---
My cousin works there too. He is going to steal your dads lunch Money 
---
Bayer lost patents as a result of World War I. That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about here.
---
As far as Xerox, you're talking about genericized trademarks. Which has also nothing to do with Blizzard, Nostalrius, or WoW, unless somehow Nostalrius causes everyone to start calling all MMORPGs "World of Warcraft" which would be an illogical conclusion.
---
Shadow meld drinking is REALLY handy in BGs.  Other thing is low level when horde goes after you if you can meld first they come looking for you so you can fear blast dot really quick to get started. Tough fight after that but it does kinda work
---
Oof...
---
Elitist mentalities should stay dead, friend.
---
In my experience people who say that it's all nostalgia have either never played vanilla, or they did and want to seem like some arbiter of unwanted truth when really they are just contrarian fun police.
---
Nostalrius didn't cause people to start calling all MMORPGs "World of Warcraft" so the whole genericized trademark argument doesn't apply here.
---
Be fucking patient dude. The longer it takes to come out the better the game will be. Also, once it's out there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Play some other games, there are tons of games to play right now.
---
Retail rewards zerging and brainless, unchallenging solo content. Even it groups it feels solo. Fucking DULL
---
&gt; I wondered what happened to "stick and stones might break my bones but words will never harm me"?
---
That has, in the public education system, been methodically reverted to "seek out sticks and stones and pretend that they've broken my bones." It is no surprise that the latest few generations are pro-censorship. 
---
That has nothing to do with it. They have the potential to be at the top, therefore they are more popular. Druids do not, therefore they are less popular.
---
If you don’t want elitism, play BfA
---
Interesting. I guess time will tell
---
5 days /played time? It’s about 8 (16 hours) days of playing. You think I’m being too optimistic?
---
Lmao
---
Excuse me? Care to back this claim up? 
---
\`Lightwell is actually a pretty good spell, the problem is no one in a raid is willing to right click the well
---
What subs did you grab? You'll have to get some some good speakers to go along with it! I'm currently running two 10" and 12" Klipsch KSW ground firing subs, with the Klipsch Quintet V with two more of the same model bookshelf speakers. Got it all on a solid 7.2 Sony receiver, and it's honestly just too much sometimes, lol. 
---
Is this the quest chain that gives you the service bell? 
---
It’s more fun being an indestructible healer anyway
---
Mages get blink which surprisingly adds up over time. 
---
This is a great post but I fear the concepts of rationality and measured dispensation of justice equal to the crime will be superseded by peoples' immediate sensation of ticklish fear in the stomach. We are conditioned to fear anything that's not politically correct and to treat wrongthink as an almost mortal threat. And because emotion usually comes before thought, you're kind of asking a bunch of tree monkeys not to act so paranoid. It is their nature to be paranoid. 
---
Anyway, the correct thing to do is to just expand the /ignore list limitations and allow for right-click ignore. Reimplement the swear filter for people who don't want to see that. *Pow*, nobody has to deal with anything they don't want to see. But I fear that is not good enough because people, in the last 20 years, have more and more deputized themselves as crusaders against injustice ((as they perceive it(as it was defined to them when they were young, before they could think for themselves)).
---
&gt;Why would Blizzard advertise it much (or at all)?
---
To recapture old players not aware of its existence?
---
&gt;Two Ret Paladins, a Balance Druid, and a Shadow Priest? And complete the raid? Absolutely. Do we want to? Do we really want to gimp ourselves in that fashion, tacking on an extra hour or two every single night of raiding?
---
As someone who is going to have a limited amount of time to play in Classic I completely understand what you're saying. But let's take a minute to back-of-the-napkin the math for this:
---
If you've got 30 people averaging 600 DPS that's 18,000 DPS.
---
If we swap out four of those people for two rets, an oomkin, and a shadow priest we lose about 400 DPS. That makes 17,600 DPS. That's a decrease of 2.2%
---
If your MC raid was taking two hours before it will now be taking two hours and three minutes. A total increase of three minutes isn't nothing, but it's not the back-breaking "hour or two" that you mentioned in your post.
---
I pulled a lot of those numbers out of thin air, but I'd bet it's pretty close. If anyone with harder stats would like to post them I'd certainly be interested in seeing the results.
---
Strat live is the thing you are looking for, my former MT used to do strat live res runs (reserving orbs, flask recipe and BOEs), its on high demand because tanks doesnt need any gear from strat live, so its hard finding one.
---
As a vanilla Marshal Pvp Druid  and elite end game raider I played both at a high level as a resto Druid and a feral Druid. I mained as resto druid and once we had content up to naxx on farm I had the right gear to MT ZG 20, AQ 20, MC (excluding Rag because of fire resist gear) and parts of BWL for our B team. This was very very gear dependent though and it took countless hours to achieve probably more than most will be willing to put in.
---
Additionally I pretty much mained as a resto Druid flag runner in Pvp until rank 11 and once I had enough gear and was bored healing, my group let me play feral in our BGs but even with literally the best gear you could possible get in the game and a tremendous amount of skill Pvp Druid is still difficult. Lots of pouncing players and being dependent on key crits out the gate our it will be drawn into a long fight between shifting to bear, heals and cat. Plus side is you will be very difficult to kill which makes you a great flag guard in AB and AV.
---
There was a career feral Pvp Druid we played against a lot and that guy was by far better than me. He was the best feral Druid I have ever seen Pvp wise and he could kill anyone, Outlive anyone and just fucking dominate but he was an extreme example. 1 out of a million type. 
---
We had 5 warriors that could wreck just as hard with half the skill so that tells you a lot about he end game viability of a feral Druid when it comes to damage.
---
To sum up - boomkin is a joke and wasn’t viable until B.C. | Feral is your only option to kills as a Druid at lvl 60 and you will be very gear dependent and skill dependent. You aren’t setting yourself up for success and you will need to end game raid as a resto Druid to get the right feral gear.
---
I loved healing as a resto druid so I had a lot of fun but I wouldn’t steer you towards end game as a feral. You will need to put your time in as Resto first.
---
No private server discussion.
---
I couldn’t agree more. WoW was a social game. That’s what made it so great. It’s definitely fallen off and you literally do feel like you’re playing the game by yourself. Your friends could be online doing stuff around Azeroth etc and you guys wouldn’t be in a group. Maybe messaging or in discord. You literally can do everything yourself. There isn’t a challenge. There isn’t a grind. When you get something rare it doesn’t feel worth it because many of players can easily get the same thing. Interaction is what made fun to spend hours of your day doing. It didn’t feel like a chore like it does now. 
---
You actually have to work together in classic and interact. 
---
I am so excited for it to come out. Been playing as much private servers as I can leading up to it. 
---
I’m sorry, but toxic behavior should be punished, simply ignoring it isn’t addressing the problem. 
---
Anyone who equates punishing toxic behavior with censorship is extremely misguided. 
---
Pretty sure it´s 16th of July, but they couldn´t comit to it yet.

They tweeted sth along the lines of "get ready for a classic summer" so late August should only be the case if something goes wrong massively.
---
People like that are why mind control got tweaked and this is coming from me someone who also abused tricks like that. You could also use it to give the opposing faction buffs which I suppose in theory could mean horde could get pal buffs temporarily. I used to run up to lowbies mind control them which freaked them the fuck out thinking they were going to get ganked and then give them power word fortitude. 
---
Oof that mentality really kills most retail Vs classic arguments for.
---
I'm playing in an m+ dungeon group that plays 15+ dungeons + raiding in a HC guild, both of which are not cutting edge by any means but I could not imagine doing this without talking at all.
---
You can play most of the game very well without having to talk to anybody, certainly not the PvP and pve endgame.
---
Feel like there is already 20 of these posts floating around. Surprised a mod hasn't kicked it to the curb.
---
100% a druid.
---
Thanks. 
---
I was on mobile and I couldn’t see the date. 
---
Amazing feet. 
---
Omg this!!!
---
Wasnt Lightwell added really late in vanilla? Like 1.11 or something.
---
Do you have experience as a mage?
---
Vanilla ice made could be insanely dominate and fun. Lots of damage and survivability. It takes skill but you can wreck hard.
---
I think Classic is a great MMO.
---
However, I do think for everyone there is some rose-tinted goggles. Everything is optimized. There won't be excuses to not be talented optimally/doing things optimally. And everyone already has their pre-set groups going into Classic, so playing solo and meeting people to play with won't be as authentic as Vanilla when everyone hopped in solo to this vast, beautiful world.
---
It'll still be great though, but it won't be the same as when Vanilla launched.
---
I see a lot of people here talking about how it used to be about community and needing to form groups with people to get things done.
---
The closer we get to classic's release, the more I'm seeing that this community isnt what it once was.  Yes it's still the same people, but I keep coming back to the word 'jaded'.  Players have spent so long doing the same things over and over on private servers now and i feel as though jaded is the best way to describe them.
---
These players only talk about the rush to endgame, or try to rationalize minmaxing because they need to stomp aq40 before 70% of the population even sees their first mount etc...
---
Why bother playing classic if you're only going to socialize within the guild you're bringing from a private server, because they're going to be the fastest way for you to hit 60?  I guess I just dont understand.
---
I tried the private server thing before, but the social atmosphere felt so different, and maybe it's because I got there late, but no one bothered responding to conversation, and when they did it was sarcastically at best.
---
In the end there will still be the people I remember from classic who are just doing their own thing, and when I send a whisper for BRD, I'll get a positive reply and have a great run.  I'll friendlist that person and hope to see them in groups in the future.
---
I just worry for the toxicity that the hardcore and minmax players may bring to the table now that I've seen a fair bit of their posting here and on forums like barrens chat or the blizz official forums.
---
Obviously egregious bullying will need to be reported, as ever. I'm talking more about the desire to punish people for joking around or for being gruff. 
---
I saw so few people with TCG rewards, I think this is a non-issue.
---
Amazing 
---
Il stand corrected 
---
I was on mobile so I couldn’t see the dates and I didn’t think it was doable In sholo.  
---
It was probably the most efficient heal in cata of any healing spec by a shit ton. You could glyph so it would auto heal but if you could convince your raid to actually use it and glyph the extra charges it was really strong. I remember it being a really nice addition to our 10m dragon soul progression.

Watch Thralls episode of cribs, I think it's easy to say after that.
---
As someone who joined late 2007, it was upsetting to later find out about all the cool things I missed. Azeroth still had plenty of people for me to quest with, however I was so clueless I leveled all the way to 60 before going to Outland. My biggest regret was not playing when it came out because I was scared of the stigma

True. I'd still like to have a turtle mount though.

Stoneform is amazing and escape artist can make gnome warriors extremely strong. Gnome is the best pvp warrior imo, orc is up there too but a very skilled gnome will be a tough matchup for some mages.

---
Perhaps you should have been more specific, but yes, I agree. 
---
I've been called names, laughed at to a point where I cried in my youth. And I agree there where people among me who had it worse. But I dealt with it and my father always said I should stand up for myself. 
---
Anonymity might have made it worse but then again it's also less personal.
---
Huh I was thinking of nerubians I think 
---
I see a lot of opinion here but I was often our top
---
Healer as a resto druid in our 20/40 mans. I often stayed on MT.
---
You get your hots up and you small HT if it’s going to be an over heal you W out of the cast and cancel it while loading a the next one up immediately. It takes skill and it takes time learn the fights.  
---
Especially in PVP!
---
Mained a mage from Cata onwards and have over five days played on a pserver as a mage. Going Elemental Mage tho. Hate being like everyone else so thats another reason why Druid is so appealing 
---
Lol.  Elitism is a toxic mentality.  It shouldnt exist anywhere
---
This. A thousand times.
---
At least we agree that it shouldn't be as simple as a right click. I'd even invite you to agree with me that being reported shouldn't result in an automated ban, but should instead be reviewed by a rational actor. 
---
wrong use of meme
---
hmm, petition for blizz to make a server named "Lake Laogai"? 
---
You're invited, of course.
---
Trying to win and be successful at a video game shouldn’t exist.
---
Huh. Interning perspective 
---
Yep, I used it on H Rag 25, for that in-between phase with the movement and the explosions and tons of raid damage. If you had a "/target lightwell" macro and Interact With Target keybound, using Lightwell was super easy.
---
It does bug me a little bit too.  Among other things, I'm trying to look at this board the same way I have to remind myself of how to look at the FFXIV Reddit board when something there irks me: It's not that representative of many of the people you see and meet in-game because many of the good ones are busy actually playing the game.
---
Obviously, that last part can't apply to Classic WoW currently, but it's something to keep in mind when it starts.
---
When will the whole guide be available?
---
The last BioWare Baldur's Gate game was in 2001, the last outsourced one was in 2004.
---
In the 2010s Larian Studios had the bright idea that hmm, maybe this entire game genre shouldn't die out, maybe there is a market for it, it's possible that people are still alive who played Baldur's Gate II and they're waiting for a followup. So through crowdfunding they develop and release Divinity Original Sin in 2014, then the sequel in  2017, and both do extremely well. There is no hand-holding, it's not noob friendly, and it's very complex.
---
This is pretty much all we want. Somebody, anybody, create an authentic MMORPG in a medieval setting with some passion behind it. That's all it takes. It could be EQ3, WoW 2, whatever.
---
It just so happens that in 2019, 2004's Classic WoW is the closest thing we have to match this style of game. And the amount of groveling and petitioning it took just to get it made was astounding.
---
yep
---
Lol this is dumb. Druids are amazing healers. Dont do dumb shit where you have to walk lol
---
I for one am looking forward to my 118th run through STV 
---
"should just take them off your bars"  - As a warlock I have to say - "Shut your dirty mouth!"  
---
Just kidding of course.  Us warlocks love any HoTs we receive, so keep them on your bar for us please :)  They give us flexibility with our hp/mana management and rotation.  If I receive a direct heal that heals me to full, then I must lifetap right away.  To be at full health during a fight is inefficient.  It wastes any other group heal, direct heal, chain heal that we might could receive.  Health = mana for warlocks on long fights and if someone heals me at full health than i've basically wasted a resource.  If you HoT me instead of a direct heal, then I have time to lifetap on a schedule more conducive to my rotation.  Maybe my corruption is about to fall off and I need to reapply it before lifetapping.  Maybe I'm in the middle of a trinket and lifetapping would waste some of the trinket.  
---
TLDR - warlocks always prefer HoTs and good warlocks use them strategically.
---
I dunno. That hunter who killed a streaming Druid levels above him became a hero of sorts.
---
We took a ret pally with us into Bwl ..... We didnt clear 
---
Playing solo on private servers I was more challenged by some basic leveling quests than I was for everything except some dungeons/raids on live for the past couple expansions. Just last night I took on a quest that realistically should have been labeled a group quest but because I knew what I was doing when I specced my talents and tried hard I was able to solo it. 
---
If your playing horde and you want to kill people go shaman. It can be a little gear dependent end game
---
Since it’s hard to
---
Gear up but you can wreck.
---
-former vanilla marshal Druid and end game
---
Raided full through naxx
---
Title checks out
---
I don't think it should be punished, only when it impacts your gameplay. There is a swear filter and you can choose to toggle it on or off. GM should be there for gameplay problems
---
Whatever server Asmongold chooses might be the exception here. His fanbase loves fucking with him, so I could see him getting ganked constantly.
---
Just repeated, efficient dungeon runs. If your group is good, quick and efficient then you don't even need to skip trash etc. Grab 3 good DPS buddies preferably with AoE and go ham. The difference between a fast &amp; efficient run vs. a slow one is night and day.
---
To be honest go for dungeons that you just like clearing and that you already practiced. But high value BoE, Chests and high amount of bosses per hour are a big plus. Also for the healer it is often very beneficial if there are dark/demonic rune drops.
---
It also depends on professions, because some dungeons have profession specific drops/material objects.
---
Yeah it was a big deal at the time. The Hunter forums were freaking out back then. There were rumors it was possible the same way Dire Maul North Tribute was soloable by hunters. But once this got posted everyone tried it. I know I did. I could get to the boss, but just didnt have the skills/ practice time to actually kill him. It's still honestly impressive.
---
Ok sorry 980dps. Equally geared fire mage does 1300. 
---
Absolutely! I rarely used my innervate on myself because i was an efficient healer. I would reward other great healers and DPS with an innervate when  I felt they deserved it or needed it when they weren’t over healing(in case of healers).
---
I would only save my innervate for myself when I knew I was going to need it in a particularly ooming fight. 
---
The power of racials
---
I just want to play an MMO again without a cash shop.
---
Good thing Rage potions exist.
---
End game vanilla resto druid - top heals in nearly every raid. Never went oom. I don’t think you know resto druids or end game healing in vanilla.
---
This checks out, no other possible reason!
---
Hmm this has me rethinking my profession choices. I was obviously going to do herb/mining but it looks likes so many have this plan already might be worth to just pick up a crafting profession from the get go. There will be so many mats flooding the market early on.
---
I wasnt doing aq40 but i still did mc, bwl and aq20.  Never had an elitist attitude.  They arent mutually inclusive
---
I'm a Nelf priest and I approve this message.
---
You *NEED* herbalism. I would advise everyone to at least have one character with herbalism since the overuse of consumables will earn you a shit-ton of gold. Druids are also one of the most powerful world PvPers in the game so you will easily be able to duel over a black lotus. You don't even have to spec feral/balance or the hybrid. As long as you are decent at your class you can smoke most PvE oriented farmers.
---
Also, if possible, get the 4-set PvP bonus which gives you 15% movement speed in all forms, which means your travel form will rival a normal mount and you can easily maneuvre around people in the open world. 
---
Now combine this with engineering and oh boy, you will be one of the most hated sights for any herbalist! 
---
Even the druid PvP trinket is almost custom tailored for world PvP. If you don't know, the PvP trinkets in vanilla remove different effects depending on what class you are. Druids remove stuns, charms and fears. The remaining ones (root, slow, polymorph) can be removed by shapeshifting. So you are just an incredible solo farmer.
---
Gae dude
---
Oof, Also raider91J is correct, people like this kylie guy is the worst, get off your moral high horse.
---
I think you assume when I say elitist mentality, you imagine me just flaming people and trolling newbs.
---
When I say elitist mentality, I mean trying to progress as fast as possible, efficient and with little mistakes and using proper rotations and being the best geared on the server. Has nothing to do with being a dick to people.
---
I just want separation of skilled players vs newbs 
---
What I said was a joke and I didn't drop the N word. I refer you to my section on "Offensive the word, has to much legitimacy". You can easily just replace offensive with toxic in that sense.
---
Since it's uploaded before TBC launched I'd say it's pretty safe to assume it's retail. 
---
It's BigGer man Guy damnit, how many times must i tell you people
---
A shit ton of people are going into classic solo and you do not need an excuse to have fun playing the game your way. People always asked why I pvp as Arcane in retail and I just say I play for fun. 
---
This is the quality content I subbed for.
---
you keep using this word, I don't think it means what you think it means... 
---
King's honor, friend 
---
That's a perfect example of a good investment.
---
Nah, I'll just join a guild that brings the player not the class. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
Classic managed to survive pretty well without it though, in the years of its launch. I refer you to my post on " Offensive the word, has to much legitimacy", just replace offensive with nasty and toxic. 
---
HUGE REASON
---
Nothing is a must in vanilla
---
This entire sub consists of 28 year olds who hate twitch so obviously the answers you will get are gonna be a biiiit biased. 
---
&gt;everyone has their pre-set groups/guilds
---
I feel like, for the majority of the population, this will be the opposite. I'd wager the bulk of the people who will stick around are working adults without a full fledged guild or dungeon group coming with them to Classic. 
---
There will definitely be guilds switching over from pservers and retail, but I doubt this will be the majority of folks in the long term.
---
His other dialog
---
"Bow your head in my presence, &lt;race&gt;. I am a noble, after all, and you are a copperless peasant."
---
He doesn't think much of players.
---
The only thing selfish here is you. A game like vanilla requires a lot of time investment. If this is your argument then perhaps vanilla isn't for you? Yeah, I think retail is for you! There's a whole mythic dungeon option where you have to clear it as fast as possible! You want to preserve your time right?
---
If you did not read my entire post, I implore you to do so. Trust me, I was very pissed throughout this exchange and I did not find it remotely funny. I specifically direct you towards my section on "Offensive the word has to much  legitimacy "
---
It won't be the same, but I know a lot of people are going to have to find new guilds and people to play with. I don't know anyone from my old guild anymore, so I will have to find new people to play with and make new friends. I think a lot of people will be in this boat too! 
---
oh okay. Sorry.
---
I would implore you to reconsider and play ice mage. 
---
Arcane in vanilla was poop at 60. No viability in PvE or pvp
---
Fire is decent PvE and your just a two minute mage with no survivabilty in PVp
---
I’ve mage is great dps in PvE and dominate in Pvp. Lots of damage and survivability.
---
If you stick to this character to level 60 you will
---
Most likely go ice mage so you might as well level that way so you are ahead of the learning curve when you get there.
---
I can see that, I enjoy bear tanking personally.  I am busy keeping track of each mob and keeping them off the healers / dps.  I also try to get Faerie fire on each mob both for the small amout of threat and physical dps.  Demo roar, feral charge, definitely not as busy as a warrior but enough for me personally.
---
Lore written when? I personally don't consider anything post 2007ish canonical.
---
Nothing about this post is a "thoughtful conversation"
---
They already said they won't allow you to communicate with opposite faction players on Bnet. Will a shortcut be found? Probably, getting into contact with the opposite faction isn't really difficult at all, it wasn't in vanilla and with todays communication stuff like discord it will be a breeze. 
---
Nope
---
I agree, checking here every day has become an addiction in itself. MMO champion is pretty on it when it comes to updates. They always cover blue posts.
---
[This one her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)e isn't official, but you can at least suscribe for updates.
---
In any case, it's a good example of how we assume the worst in others. If you'd had the power to ban me or delete my comment in the moment when you were attributing to me the worst intentions would you have done so? 
---
People unironically think you can't mafia without being obvious about it, and with blizzard showing no interest in employing actual humans to do customer support, I doubt much action will be taken.
---
I agree, I don't think I ever said they are not allowed to do what they want, I just made the argument that it is not rational. Regarding toxicity, I refer you to my section on "Offensive the word, has too much legitimacy", just replace offensive with toxic.
---
I feel like your last sentence is a bit contradictory. If I can say what I want, but I will be muted for saying somethings, then I cannot really say what I want.
---
I recently saw a video of a hunter using the optimum damage rotation (weaving in spells between auto attacks or however that works). It blew my mind, I had no idea.
---
Anyone know off the top of their head roughly what time we've been getting these posts the last couple weeks?
---
So far as I know I did not make a legal argument that they cannot do what they want, I just made the argument that it is not rational for them to do so
---
That's just one boss. Here is a warlock soloing all of Scholomance back in 2006: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCM2SSZYDSA
---
Thank you for the suggestion. 
---
A Path of Exile style "Announcement of the Announcement" 
---
Let’s hope so.. imagine like a spectral tiger in the shop. Haha 
---
The "at all" part was dramatic exaggeration, I admit. :) I'm sure they'll advertise it some but nothing major. Everything points to them expecting a large influx of tourists (from retail, so already playing) and a not too large, not too small playerbase after (many returning players). But not enough people to really go out of their way for.
---
Hi, /u/HYPERMANIAS
---
I agree with this. I also don’t really see the need to bind the S key, when I have 48 buttons on a mouse with a 12-button mouse plus Alt and Ctrl. Do most people not use a 12-button mouse? 
---
Yeah but that's not what elitism is. Elitism is bad full stop, and I say this as someone who wants to no life. This a community game, we can be welcoming and also serious about progression. You don't have to be an "elitist" to do well at this game.
---
&gt;Do most people not use a 12-button mouse?
---
I don't think they do, and yeah I use one myself :)
---
Oh, I do plan on going frost. I plan on raiding as frost and respeccing after I get the gear I want. 
---
Shahmoooon
---
That's how
---
Free test accounts really shouldn’t be a thing for Vanilla. I’ve no problem with Bnet chat though
---
One of my exact reasons too, that and the games journey being much slower and longer
---
Right? I've already got four potential characters planned out, in order of creation, with professions and three or four names each. I have no reason to spend 45 minutes reading "Life at 60" guides, and yet..
---
Damn. Oh well. I'd really prefer an official one, but thank you for the suggestion anyway. 
---
I've always said it as Shawman, but I had to google it to know the truth. Google agrees with me
---
&gt; I decided to use axes mainly since humans will be probably prioritized over when it comes to swords and maces in raids. (and dark edge of insanity seems like a good long term goal)
---
Guilds usually don't prioritize based on race. It's all about DKP or attendance/performance. Never been in any guild that only let humans roll on swords and maces, especially when it comes to two-handers which are mostly wanted for PvP where weapon skill doesn't apply anyway. The thing is that sword spec is better than axe, and there aren't really good axes until C'Thun so it's kind of a weird spec choice when you could go swords and choose between Bonereaver's and Ashkandi in the first half of vanilla. You can always switch to axes if you eventually do get a DEoI, but don't build around it ahead of time.
---
The real story here is why you felt the need to tell someone to eat a bag of dicks 
---
decent geared prot war can solo elite dragonkin in burning steppes - my old MT used to do this for money.
---
Shaman and Warloxk have the best IMO
---
Shahman in US, Shayman in UK according to [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/shaman)
---
Is anybody going to comment about the halo gun in the middle?
---
&gt;Blizz already said they won't allow you to communicate with opposite faction players on Bnet.
---
I am not/was not aware of this. But a fellow redditor explained it all very well. 
---
LFM MC PUG LINK ACHIV PLZ
---
I just stole it from somewhere and edited it
---
Blonde?
---
Kinda thought so lol
---
No pressure just want to give you the best advice possible. Cheers mate!
---
Scarlet Stratholme is a good example of this. My group used to zerg it over and over for righteous orbs and it turned out to be pretty lucrative because of all the cloth/blues/vendor trash we got in the process alongside the orbs.
---
I mean I could’ve looked for the original template but to be fair I have no idea what should I search for
---
I understand
---
Oof sorry then I’ll do better next time
---
Not only is the chain reward bomb. But 1.8g was a lot of gold back the yo! It’s like when grandpa tells you a coke was a nickel. 
---
As a horde you might consider picking something else, because your targets will gnome out and Blessing of Freedomed quite often. 
---
For alliance it is nice to have 3/3 for it to proc every 1 out of 6.6 hits instead of 1 out of 10 with 2/3. 
---
No it’s fine, just funny how you chose that of all things
---
If you plan on doing PvP booming voice is amazing as it increases the range of demo shout to 15yards. Demo shout breaks rogue stealth, so you have better chances catching rogues offguard.
---
I would encourage everyone to read my entire post, so as to avoid me having to refer you to specific sections that have already answered your question. Furthermore I would say that I am not a racist and that I am not making an argument that Blizzard is operating illegally or that they cannot do what they are doing, I am just saying that it is not rational for them to do what they are currently doing.
---
Free Test accounts aren't going to be in classic. Also, the argument is that you shouldn't be able to add people on the opposite faction who aren't currently your friends. If you meet some alliance as a horde who you don't know beforehand, there is no way to communicate a discord name or anything like that. It's a pretty bad argument. Even IF you could, just because something is possible doesn't mean you shouldn't take preventative measures. That's just like saying "Why implement an anti-gold farming system? people are just going to get around it anyways"
---
Sounds like the flag was capped.. alls well that ends well
---
I level up with bear talents in mind.  I like being optimally specc'd in dungeons, even leveling up.  I also like the playstyle of the bear more than the cat, even though it is slower.
---
1 point in Balance.  11 points in Feral to get Feral charge, picking up thick hide along the way.  7 points in Resto to get Furor and Imp Enrage.  Then I get to 31 points in Feral for Leader of the pack.  Then i put 11 points into Balance getting Omen of Clarity.  Then I go back and put my last 2 points in feral.  11/33/7, basic bear tank spec.
---
That is how I do it personally.  I know it is not optimal or meta or whatever, just my preference.
---
I might level a bit slower, but that is my own time.  When I tank dungeons I know I've done everything I can to make the run a success.
---
Traditionaly druids were male elves and priests were female elves. Whule we wait for classic to drop I recommend you errr...obtain somehow WoW books. Some of them such as the 3rd one (forgot the name) and a book called Stormrage realy present the elven culture, customs and hierarchies well
---
Stout and bitter.
---
Excellent work. I fondly remember leveling cooking during classic. The buffs were an added bonus.
---
Swords only gets better later in progression. If you are a first wave ranker its Arcanite Reaper &gt; 3.8 swords any day of the week as you will cripple yourself with 15-19% shit crit chance. 
---
Arcanite reaper gives you a good 22-25% (as high as 28 with bersi) right off the bat. 
---
Only once you acquire rank gear, quickstrike ring, AV ring etc. you really start to accumulate crit from gear and dont need to rely on +5% crit from the talents.
---
First time this happened to me in AV... I felt so dumb lol
---
As I mentioned in my "problems along the road" paragraph, the problem with this is, where does it stop? If we allow the idea to operate, will they keep scaling it up and then when we voice our concerns later on, just say, "But you agreed to the principal idea, I am just pursuing it further now."
---
i feel like this meme was made by a learning ai trying to generate content for this subreddit
---
What? Google says "Shahman"
---
For bear it means you can Feral charge right after shifting.  And rage goes down over time, not up.  So a bit different for a bear obviously.
---
This, although I still say Shahman as a Brit.

The guy's talking about Dark Edge of Insanity so I don't reckon he's planning around Arcanite Reaper. Regardless, swords are still better if the available weapons are equal. Getting a sword spec proc is just about as good as getting a crit except it's even better for rage generation and has higher burst potential since both attacks can still crit individually for basically 4x damage. There's no gear level where axes are better than swords except for a brief window of time where Arcanite Reaper is the best weapon and no comparable sword exists. As soon as MC drops are on the table, that ceases to be the case.

Another trash nelfling Priest checking in!
---
Look at any post asking about which class to play or viability of different specs.
---
The most upvoted comments are always "just play what you think is fun".
---
Whereas the comments that actually break down the pros and cons tend to get downvoted.
---
People on this sub hate anything related to min/maxing.
---
Half the arguments/opinions that I see here are based on people's experience with actual vanilla wow and they refuse to accept that things have changed over the past 15 years.
---
It’s funny to me when people talk about how much more difficult everything was in WoW but what they don’t acknowledge is that WoW was the dumbed down super easy mode of MMOs at the time it came out.
---
Looking at FFXIV that was the best MMO before WoW launches.
---
I love wow so much, but it’s what started the downward spiral.
---
The backdoor requires you to land a tricky jump onto a tiny piece of terrain that can be completely blocked by like 1-2 people. Relying on a gimmick "back door" entrance like that is almost as dumb as claiming it's an advantage. 
---
Alliance get a Bridge bottleneck to defend. Horde do not
---
Alliance can kill/capture the last Horde graveyard outside of Tower/Archer interrupt range. Horde cannot
---
Yaay! I've been waiting for this one since you started the professions overviews.  Love the series!
---
I would do that if I thought I was gonna get ganked and they would just run off 90% of the time. 
---
Let's say I know somethig, you don't. And I'm saying it's gonna be Q3. Did that help you?
---
I raided as a Shadow priest for several months through BWL and into AQ40.
---
Of course off specs and hybrid classes won't beat pure dmg classes on numbers. That would be terrible game design. If my Shadow Priest could hang with the Locks on the damage meters, and then still be able to drop Shadow form to put down some fat heals, what kind of moron would play a Warlock?
---
If ret paladins could keep up with rogues and then also throw out heals and blessings while wearing plate, all the min maxing hardcore guilds would laugh at you for playing a rogue. 
---
The strength of hybrid classes is that you can do many things, and a raid group has to be extremely hardcore to the point of perfection to not get value out of a dps that can also off tank or heal in a pinch. I'd say any ret paladin with a healing set or tanking set has a place in my raids. Do your thing and if shit hits the fan we will be glad to have a paladin instead of rogue #12
---
He's making shit up
---
The main aspect of booming voice in pvp is the increased Range on demo shout as well. Makes life easier to get rogues out of stealth.
---
I encourage anyone that wants to play a ret paladin to go with their dreams.
---
Makes it really easy for me to see who not to invite. 
---
because they love the early levelling experience of alliance, and they are dead-set on experiencing that
---
it sucks, but just because I'm die hard doesn't mean I should get more vote than 1. 
---
We all are gonna play together as a group and I know these guys are dying to go alliance so I will stick it out so we can all be together
---
"Like tagging your mobs"
---
Tagging someone else's mobs is never an offense in any given level. Hell it's incorrect to say "someone else's". All players are equal.
---
Redridge attracted lowbie killers. Ashenvale was a bit better behaved but not much. 
---
Basically the lowest level contested zones had the most devoted ganking. 
---
Right, terrible example. You get my point.
---
Meh the cash shop is the least of retails worries... 
---
Oi, don't talk shit to my mohawk
---
In Canada we say sh-eh-man.
---
1.8 gold was the shit back then.. Hell yeah!
---
Are you intentionally gimping yourself by not spending thousands of dollars to buy 420 ilvl character from ebay? Well, Method might say so, but for most people there's a line between reasonable upgrades and unreasonable upgrades. Every guild draws that line as they see it fit. For you usage of expensive consumables is a must. For me it's the last thing to do, when every other thing is checked. For example if people dying because they did not learn fight well, I would spend more time to learn them, rather than using flasks and trying to push the fight with them dead.
---
Just means you stack spell damage and hit
---
Justify it lore-wise!
---
Welcome to Omega!
---
We are a bunch of classic nerds with a lot of experience in World of Warcraft retail and Classic servers and our purpose is to pursue a top spot on the Server we choice on launch day.
---
We will be part of everything that happens on our server - May it be PvE, PvP Ranking, World Bosses, World PvP.
---
You should expect us to do the unexpected and we will be both a feared and loved establishment of our server.
---
Server Type: EU - PVP
---
Faction: Horde
---
Join our discord for more information about rules and our guild.
---
Discord Channel: https://discord.gg/zmYmVP
---
(Raid times still being discussed. But we will try and make these times so that it will not clash with work and family/friends time)
---
We will be using DKP System during raid and our planned raid roster will look like below (might change slightly). 
---
8 Warriors 6 Rogues 8 Mages 5 Priests (+- 1 Shadow) 4 Warlocks 2 hunters 2 druids 5 shamans (1 enhance)
---
But this will give you a general idea of what type of classes we are looking for in raids. Ofcourse anyone that wants to join the guild is welcome and we will try and reward everyone even if they dont assist in raids but in other ways that will benefit our guild.
---
If you are intressted in raiding. Please send us an email to omega.eu.classic@gmail.com with your discord name, class you plan to play and a little about yourself and what your optimal raid times are.
---
You keep using this word.
---
I dont think it means what you think it means.
---
I remember when I played WoD I needed an achievement for pugs, fortunately there was a way to link a false achievement.
---
They got a bit pissed when it suddenly said I got the achievement when we killed last boss :D
---
Leveled a million times on pservers as warrior and here are my thoughts. Someone else mentioned crits being nutty as arms and thats true, its why you go axes even as human. The imp hamstring proc on a pvp server will actually fully win you the 1v1 in many scenarios and you want that. So as far as the arms tree goes you definitely wanna cap axe spec imp hamstring and overpower too actually. Most people take out 2/5 2h wep dmg cause if you really think about it, that might save you 1 swing out of every 10 mobs. A big crit overpower(affected by impale!) that drops a thicc deep wounds is much much better
---
As far as the fury tree goes booming voice is best over unbridled both for pvp against rogue and potentially warrior, druid. This isnt the only thing though, you are so rage starved leveling you will definitely feel the battle shout duration. I did see that you like unbridled wrath, but remember that for 2h weapons it caps at 3 or 4 points, any more wont do anything. Finally blood craze vs bshout, blood craze significantly improves your mob to mob killspeed and down time. In fact on most servers when i swap fury in t1 gear, i actually gimp my spec with blood craze over bshout so i can actually farm mobs at a decent speed - again you really notice the difference over time (fury &lt;&lt;&lt; arms mob farming speed even with t1 level gear/weps). It actually makes it so you heal about double what the critical hit against you hits for
---
It was never people acting like assholes that bothered me about cross-realm. It was that the other 90% of people no longer bothered to put in much effort to be social. 
---
Another thing was that I always prided myself on my mana regeneration and knowledge of healing rotations so I made it a point to others that they didn't need to worry about me. Once that Dark Moon Blue dragon procced and you popped a healing potion, you felt absolutely invincible and like your mana would never go away.
---
Druid's are fundamentally about self-sufficiency. Yes there will be times when you need to innervate yourself, but if you are doing your job, you shouldn't have to.
---
You need to be an axesmith 
---
I wrote about this about two weeks ago on this sub.
---
I received A TON of grief hahahah
---
There is "Pantheon: Rise of the fallen" which is in development right now (still at least 2 years before it will be released) that is looking to return to these kind of mmorpg. Though it's pushing more the EQ style where outside of maybe some classes or killing things a lower level than you, you should expect to need to group up with people to accomplish much of anything.
---
I know some people who would macro their innervate to a whisper and say stuff like "you've just been innervated now give them hell!". Imagine being a priest and seeing that pop up on your buff bar. You would feel like a god.
---
I would think that depends on both the victim knowing that they got reported by a streamer and knowing who the streamer is so they can search around for the clip
---
Only if you need an instant cast or have no mana.  So occasionally good in a pinch. But it heals the same as flash heal. 
---
Until you realise spinal is actually better than bre unless its literally naxx version (:
---
You can still win titles in Vanilla, they’re basically achievements except more fun because others can see them. The main ones being PvP ranks (and scarab lord of course) but there’s others as well.
---
Hillsbrad IIRC 
---
You're sacrificing even more dps by bringing an enh shaman.
---
What wow has over every other game, is how responsive it is. Only other mmo that got that part right, was Archeage. FF felt terribly unresponsive the little I played it, same with swotor ect. 
---
Not even ganking either. Really embarrassing kill. They jump you and you kite them plus the two elites you aggroed to death. Gotta make it juicy
---
Priests also have a slightly higher natural spirit regeneration rate, so if you combine a blue dragon with an innervate they are basically unstoppable healing monsters.
---
My man thinks he's gonna raid AQ40 with an arms pvp spec and get Dark Edge. 
---
So many people are in for a nasty reality check when Classic Launches. 
---
Are you just going to add everyone on the other faction as bnet friends? And you expect them to accept those random friend requests? Man this sub is so fucking delusional and paranoid about every fucking thing, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Shimmering flats is one. Absolutely no guards, almost mandatory quests, allyhorde has exact same quests at same place, very small area and quest mobs have terrible droprate so you stay there a while.
---
I've played wow on and of since march 2005. I've played most every mmo that's come out since 2007. 
---
Every mmo now, including current BFA is so hard to jump into. There's several layers of abstraction, story and meta to get through.
---
Classic wow you hop in, and help out some farmers and wake some lazy peons. And I think that's the experience people are craving. The simplicity of just being in a world.
---
IMO the best mmo on the market is FFXIV, and what makes it work is the mentor system and how encouraged you are to talk and ask questions in chat from the start.
---
That´s your own problem.
---
Nonetheless, all those huge battles players did? They aren´t part of the story.
---
Hillsbrad isn´t huge battlefield between Alliance and Horde. It´s peaceful area, one of the last in Lordaeron, where Syndicate, naga and murlocs are bigger threat to the Alliance/Horde than the other faction.
---
Stranglethorn Vale isn´t territory where people are constantly threathened by the other faction (mostly rogues). It´s troll territory. And there definitely isn´t murder fiesta in Nesingwary´s camp.
---
Redridge isn´t contested territory between Alliance and Horde. Its western portion is firmly held by Stormwind, while in the east, forces of Dark Horde are entrenched in former human holdings.
---
And Westfall isn´t Alliance territory. Stormwind abandoned it and all that remains is bunch of farmers, some of which formed militia based around one watchtower.
---
And let´s also not forget Ahn´Qiraj and Legion´s assault from Outland. In both these cases, Alliance and Horde fought together, in first case under unified command of an orc. Story of Vanilla is story of growing tensions between the factions, that eventually culminated in Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm. But not in Vanilla.
---
This however is not just down to the swords, but to what the warrior has access to.
---
T0: Arcanite Reaper &gt; Demonshear
---
T1: BRE only through the roof due to the hardcore buff. Without Spinal Reaper would be a strong contender. +5% crit really is quite good and should not be overlooked if you have trash preRank PvP gear.
---
ZG: Zin'rokh indeed is really good
---
T2: again sword, because it has no contender
---
the rest is spot on.
---
However in PvP R14 gear where you can actually compare the weapons it simply depends:
---
soloPvP with beginner gear: axe
---
supported by a healer with intermedite to advanced gear: sword
---
 Pretty much all rankers on private servers run around with axes in world PvP when solo PvPing and before the gear upgrade due to the lack of crit. Sword proc = crit is a fallacy as you gain both +20% by a direct crit and deep wounds is 100+ per tick by all 3.8 2hander which can easily accumulate to 1000damage over the course of a lengthy duel.
---
Totem mule
---
Would that really change much of the lore from the third war? I haven't played WoW since mid TBC so I have no idea what happened after that.
---
For Alliance: Redridge Mountains and Duskwood are pretty bad because they are huge quest hubs for low level Alliance characters and are both contested territories. Not to mention their close proximity to STV. Makes them both super popular locations for Horde to hang out and gank lowbies.
---
For Horde: Not as experienced on the Horde side, but I know Southshore, Arathi Highlands and Stonetalon Mountain can all be pretty bad. Southshore in general is a pretty popular spot for WPvP and has a handful of quests for both factions. Stonetalon is essentially an equivalent to Redridge though it is not nearly as accessible to the opposite faction as Redridge is nor does it have as many quests.
---
Elevator boss is the toughest boss in the game.
---
That’s what made exploring in WoW and fighting more fun in a way
---
I feel like no one ever mentions the questing hub in Searing Gorge, that place is fucking lawless
---
I want to play a Dwarf, I really do. Dwarves are awesome and I think their heal animations are my favorite. But dammit their run animations are so bad to me, and 100% the reason why I probably wont roll one.
---
Try classic.wowhead.com
---
Well nowdays we propably need to change the -man part to a -person so it would be shahperson.
---
&gt; I also have reason to believe that there will be more prot warriors than fury warriors in Classic.
---
What reason do you have to believe that?
---
"lets make up numbers to prove our point"
---
I just wanna spend every waking hour playing it already 
---
5 days /played is totally doable, but as with anything else, it takes practice.
---
You're not hitting 60 in such short time by just following a guide, especially since there will be a lot of other people following the same guide.
---
The good thing about classic though is the server caps won't be anywhere near as big as on pservers (3k vs 10k+) and the starting zones will be phased, so that should help with getting ahead.
---
But again, if you really want to do it that fast, you better start practicing.
---
Get ready for felwood bois ;)
---
Enjoy raiding goldshire with your survival hunter, boomkin, and ret paladin buddies! 😅
---
Yeah it's a murderfest. Also the area leading into Blackrock mountain from SG. I basically stealthed from the flight master inside, the place was well know to be crawling with Alliance gank squads of six or more.
---
Woah, and I thought I was the cruelest priest.
---
This, going there low 50's so worth honour to 60s, just a slaughter fest
---
I will probably get down voted for saying this because some people think Imp. Hamstring is an absolute must-have BUT if you at some point get The Unstoppable Force or are lucky enough to get Sulfuras then I'd argue that Imp. Hamstring won't be necessary. In the end it comes down to what you are most comfortable with, but I personally think that having Mace Spec. + Imp. Hamstring is a bit overkill, especially if you are running Unstoppable Force.
---
Same goes for C'thun axe - you might be comfortable with just the weapon proc.
---

Feel free to provide conflicting data or shut the fuck up
---
I don't believe that right-click ignore is allowing the idea to operate. Everybody should be free to choose who they do or do not interact with. Right-click ignore and unlimited ignore slots was always the right way to do this. Plus, easier to make gold spammers disappear. 
---
My friend is in pharmacy school - he has another year to go before he’s done, but in summer he will have a 1.5 month break, I just REALLY hope his free dates coincide with the release somehow. We became friends after both of us no longer played WoW, but we are both huge fans, so it would be nice to visit WoW Classic with my now old friend 😋
---
Man I was arguing the other day about this. I swore druids had a out of comabt rez... I was wrong
---
Scarab lord title isnt in vanilla. Was added in tbc, your title is purely your pvp rank
---
Thats what vanilla wow did right. Great balance. A hard game is not necessarly a good game even though a super easy game might take the fun away with no challenges
---
STV, Redridge, Shimmering flats, Hillsbrad, Arathi Highlands, Searing Gorge, Tanaris, Un'Goro Crater.
---
Basically any contested zone where both Alliance and Horde have a questing hub. 
---
false. 
---
Maybe on broken private servers lul
---
Spring just started. Release end of Aug. Relax. 4 and a half months to go.
---
Talking 40 man raids only mate
---
Right. But point is, they are still unviable. 
---
anything can run wow
---
Absolutely. It could’ve been for Mages what Moonglade is for Druids. A pity they didn’t do anything with it till WoTLK.
---
The retail client did *very* recently.
---
Like 8.1/8.1.5, dunno if they have said they are going to add that to Classic as it's based on 7.3.5
---
lol, all the streamers will have many many groups of people hat will purely dedicate their entire playtime to ganking streamers. 
---
yall gotta be next tier retarded if you think reports in a demo matter
---
Where the fuck are you getting this completely wrong notion that mages are somehow good at dpsing?
---
I count Feral Charge (on top of other druid stuff), so you can certainly count blink.
---
asmongold is rolling a pve server.
---
If it was feasible I would love this ide so much...
---
They’d eventually have to add at least Silvermoon, if not the Blood Elves themselves. Blood Elves can be just hostile to everyone (as they frankly should have been IMO). And best of all this means no mutant space goats!
---
Polls + the raiding cores that are forming at the moment. General consensus seems to be that people are more accustomed to the idea of tanking as opposed to the pre-private server belief that it wasn't a particularly fun role. (Or at least not as fun as others)
---
Please, I raided BC in Arms spec and Fury was still vastly superior for PvE there as well.
---
Yes, I admit it's a huge deal for guilds who will push for world firsts but for guilds who doesn't and actually have the raid on farm won't be caring about being 200% optimal.
---
We have to have a WoW Classic before we can have a Blizzard TBC server.  Baby steps.
---
Moonkin Orgy?
---
Moorgy? Sounds like a tauren thing.
---
Running a dungeon with a druid healer is like taking the training wheels off.
---
You act stupid, you run back.
---
This comment misses the point so badly that I have no answer.
---
happened often enough on my pvp server back in vanilla, both planned and organically
---
No...
---
The power of 405 votes on reddit not being representative of the entire playerbase. People don't care about weapon skill or rep bonus as much as you think...
---
Felwood, best max lvl herb zone outside BL zones, people being vulnerable with dire maul buffs getting sonflower before raid.  Its gonna be some fun ^.^
---
Oh, I have a worse example. Yes, druids are limited to 1 rez per 30 minutes. But I had a group where the healer was a Paladin. Not bad. But said Paladin never did the quest chain offered at level 12 to get the Redemption spell (Paladins rez ability). Mind, the paladin in question was in her mid 30's.
---
TBC released in 2007, no?
---
The point of Moonkin is the bonus armour/. People seem to forget that, and the fact that Starfire crits will do more damage than your bear/cat.
---
My greatest moments in MMOs were killing that boss that you have been struggling with for weeks/months.  You guys know the moment I'm talking about - the voice channel EXPLODES with 40 people yelling, screaming, freaking the #@$\^ out.  Nothing has ever come close to this type of moment.
---
I've been in mid-level guilds and top-level guilds.  I never got the same satisfaction out of downing bosses in the top-level guilds....this is counter-balanced by the lack of frustration from weeks/months of wiping.
---
When you have to struggle for a goal, it is all the sweeter once attained.  Do what you will with that type of perspective on the raid scene.
---
I'm one of the lucky ones. For alliance I prefer gnomes &gt; dwarf &gt; human &gt; NE in that order aesthetically. I also want to play a priest. So I get to play the priest with the best racials and the best looks
---
It's not a problem anymore :)
---
I get it, players tend to make war in non-roleplaying places, it's an issues. But the fact remains that having peace between hostile factions in contested zones is ludicrous.
---
Too many rogues in STV = immersion challenging
---
Being able to safely walk up and pat an Orc on the head in Ashenvale = immersion shattering
---
That's how it works in my mind anyways.
---
Implying there will be a Beta?
---
&gt;  I used to run up to lowbies mind control them which freaked them the fuck out thinking they were going to get ganked and then give them power word fortitude. 
---
How did you do this?  I don't remember being able to cast while I had someone MCed.
---
I think it's worth pointing out the type of people you're like to encounter on a sub dedicated to a game that's not even out yet are going to be somewhat more hardcore than the average fan. Yes, there's a big private server crowd here, but we aren't all that, and once the game releases and word of mouth does its thing I genuinely believe they'll become the minority in the game.
---
Also, a fair amount of us are people who first played WoW back when it launched, and in the intervening 14 years have begun careers, gotten married, started families; basically all the "life happens" stuff that means few of us will have the kind of time to devote to a hardcore play style even if that's what we want to do. I've seen probably hundreds of posts in various discussions from various users saying they used to be super into raiding during Vanilla, BC or Wrath, but now they're looking to take it easy and get through the game at a nice, casual pace this time around.
---
I could be wrong, of course, but I really don't think you have anything to worry about on that front. Let the overachievers worry about themselves, you just worry about finding folks who enjoy the same kind of experience you do and everything will sort itself out.
---
idk man you seen a rdruid pre bwl? idk if id ever take one for a dungeon.  most will be hotw resto anyways so they can still play the game outside of raid, and at that point just tank dungeons
---
It won't based on the basic principal of ranking. But there will be less people playing so it will be easier to position in the top % of PvP. I did the grind in vanilla and sadly don't think I can this time. I played with an organized PvP guild from 3pm-1am every week day and even more on weekends.  I was in highschool so my school work definitely was horrific . Work and a lady would make it almost impossible. But maybe I'll change my mind depending on player base 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMAm7jT3YyM
---
I hear shahman and shawman as the same , but I would say it as shawman
---
Like SHAME-en?
---
MMO champion / wowhead / legacy-wow /icyveins
---
Are all good resources 
---
I say Shah man. The real question for me us how do you refer to multiple of them? 
---
-There are 4 shaman in the village
---
Or
---
-There are 4 shamans in the village
---
Well you're wrong.
---
The cool thing about the system is it was based on other players, not arbitrary numbers.  This means if way less of the population can dedicate those hours (because most of the target audience is 15 years older now) it'll take less work to get those ranks.  Sadly this also means if people are more serious about it now it'll be harder than it was.
---
So the answer to your question is: Depends on your realm's playerbase.  Though I'd guess on average it'll be easier.
---
Thing is, ive always felt vanilla lightwell was a too early version of the mechanic. Considering it was a 10min cd and only 5 charges (which is almost pointless in a full raid) they should have allowed it to heal through dmg.
---
ty jesteś gæ
---
Yes, I might be missinformed, but i recall it being stated around blizzcon that addon devs would get some time before release with the real api ect. This implies there being a beta of some sort
---
What about shamen? 
---
I feel like I barely ever touched shimmering flats.  I have only the most vague of vague memories of it.
---
I wanna be...
---
oh sorry, pet battles aren't a classic thing
---
What about shamen?
---
&gt; And everyone already has their pre-set groups/guilds going into Classic
---
Really? I can't wait to find out my pre-set guild I already have.
---
The point is : if we had a release date, we could at least choose our vacations accordingly
---
&gt; it is always summer in some form somewhere
---
Iceland actually IS in Northern hemisphere.
---
Summer begins in 2 weeks, to be specific.
---
&gt; It’s 6 April. The first day of spring was 20 March. Spring has been here for 17 days.
---
It's winter atm, and ends in 2 weeks. Go to school!
---
yes it was, during the priest talent rework, i remember testing it on test servers and thought what a cool new spell expect oh the HoT cancels on ANY dmg?!
---
&gt;Now I am not saying that this will lead to Nazi Germany, but in my experience, I have learnt anything is possible
---
And then goes on to compare it to Nazi Germany. Man I haven't seen a troll spend this much effort on a post in a long time. Well played op.
---
Oups sorry my bad. I remember the rest pal doing this in the raid
---
The polls I've seen have indicated that there'll be far more fury warriors than prot warriors. But fair enough, good to hear other people are seeing different things. Cheers.
---
Shaman comes up a whole lot, is there anything that makes it so interesting in particular? 
---
Lore, spells, class quests?
---
&gt;Playing an end game Druid in vanilla means you will Raid resto druid.
---
You can raid as feral.
---
Sounds consistent with my experience on Nostalrius. We had some techniques to farm around 50g/h, which meant respeccing cost me 1 hour of playing time. 
---
It was worth it some times but I always had to consider how much gold I'd be able to farm as feral before I had to respec back to resto for the next raid. 
---
Is a joke, Power Infusion was the 31 talent to pick obviously.
---
3:54PM UTC June 21 this year... right. So, that'd be 8 hours and 4 minutes into astronomical summer, assuming it begins on midnight. But the first drinks usually spill 1 or 2 hours earlier. You know... Vikings aren't the most patient.
---
Anyway, Summer Solstice is the point when it's the most hot, because sun is on the highest point on the sky, at least in Viking lands.
---
The totem class quests, for sure. Especially the water totem. That's the most grueling required class quest I've ever done. It's great.
---
It could be easier.. since most everyone knows how it works nowadays. Meaning rankers and casuals don't like spending an assload of time in bgs, so as long as your server doesn't have any huge douches then you can get away with relatively low honor bracket as long as everyone plays nice.
---
I am pissed at that point. 
---
I agree with you but would like to mention that The Unstoppable Force from AV is a thing too and quite popular as well. It has good speed with nice stats and a pretty cruel proc effect that can easily win you fights if you chain proc that and mace spec.
---
Vanilla rarely does anything close to a pure spec. You'll pretty much always combine two or all three of your trees. If you want to heal in PvP, you'll grab disc and holy talents. And it's definitely more than viable. I did a bunch ofPvP healing in vanilla and it was awesome!
---
Like any game it’s less about the content and more about the personality the streamer brings to their channel that attracts followers 
---
Tanaris.
---
It's a big annoyance for a guild to carry an arms warrior who's doing bottom tier dps and eating up a precious debuff slot. On top of that he wants priority on Dark Edge so he can p0wn n00bs in peeveepee. I'd say don't get your hopes up too high. 
---
And your pvp spec is atrocious. You literally don't have booming voices and blood craze. It's like you tried to create a spec that doesn't work in both pvp and pve. 
---
That's the best part of playing Druid. When you're in a raid, you don't have to worry about those slow and boring out of combat rezzes.
---
Not until TBC, nope.
---
Sha-man. "Sha" as in the force of evil, and 'man' as in a person.
---
The accent is on the second a in this case. 
---
If I want to do both PvP and PvE as a Druid, is it worth it to level up **engineering** or best to focus on other professions for the sake of gold and such? I know engineering is considering essential for serious PvP, but I'm thinking that Druids might have less use for it?
---
Right-Click, Inspect
---
There's your achievements.
---
To paraphrase Han Solo, ‘I don’t know, I can dream quite a bit.’
---
1g80s doesn’t quite reach that dream. 
---
&gt;I played a disc priest in WoTLK
---
Same, but in wrath disc priest had pain suppression amongst other great dmg cancelling talents.
---
Id say Vanilla Disc and Holy is almost equal in pvp, sometimes you just cant do much though without teammates helping you out. 
---
A split Disc/Holy build would propably be best for PVP suvivability.
---
Never played vanilla. Tried nostalrius, loved it, want more.
---
The whole "rose coloured glasses" argument isn't like... wrong. i bet a lot of people look upon that game with a tinted nostalgia.
---
But it's not the truth of the matter. it applies to some, which makes the argument stick around. And we're getting the game now so no point in arguing much against it, the pudding will be the proof.
---
Don't put too much hope in the arcanite reaper, its useful life will be way shorter than in Vanilla (for PVP anyway).
---
By the time you gather the mats, people will already be farming BWL.
---
I will be going for server first warrior. Aiming to do at least lvl 30 on launch day. Looking for a horde healer pref priest to level with for the first day. 
---
EU pvp server 
---
I think Shah is like AH!! Like you’re scared. AHHH!!!
---
Shaw is like you’re saying awwwww what a gimped class 
---
/em jumps
---
I probably wont play a paladin this time around, the more I think about it the less I want to have go through finding a guild of people willing to accept my "sub optimal" build. 
---
They do have an out of combat rez!
---
Once every half hour
---
1.8g back in Vanilla was probably worth about 100g in today's economy though.
---
CPU performance is important for MMOs, as this governs how well you deal with lots of people on screen at once.
---
Something like an i5 + 1050 Ti should be fine, but I probably wouldn't go lower than that.
---
Then an i7 + 1060 is probably all you need to start hitting strong diminishing returns, in terms of money-spent to more performance.
---
And I'm mentioning the older 10-series cards as it appears basically all 20-series laptops are overpriced. So definitely check the prices of 10-series laptops as comparison.
---
The 20-series are barely any faster, or better power consumption. For example the laptop 1070 is faster or equal to the laptop 2060, but normally cheaper.
---
2 people to defend the backdoor? youll need atleast 4x that. if the other team is playing for the win.
---
Honestly IF and I'm not saying they should. But if blizzard changed the hot to not fade on dmg lightwell would become very popular 
---
The lore and questing there is super fun too. There's a few caves that feel like instances all to themselves they're so deep and packed with stuff.
---
I was surprised by the number of 18-24yo in the recent poll, I think it's the second largest group. 
---
Hi, /u/kojitsuke
---
you don't need to kill people trying to use the back door, just slow them so they cannot make the jump. It can easily be done by only a couple people. Keep in mind the entire time you're trying to make that jump you're being shot by BOTH the Alliance Towers. 
---
Keep basing balance choices off buggy private servers bud :)
---
Thanks! Figured out the basics of m/f society split by a quick googling, but I'm happy to know there's more lore to be had in the books and I look forward to aquiring ye olde tomes somehow!
---
Were druid healers that bad?
---
Stv, tanaris, shimmering flats, are the top 3 imo. Those 3 zones are where you will get your first taste of the enemy faction.
---
I did it in a group of 4 and we murdered hundreds of people while we were there 
---
covers repair costs for 2 deaths!
---
agreed. though I think the probability that your guild will just disband bc lack of peogress is a lot higher nowadays... 
---
&gt; Trying to win and be successful at a video game shouldn’t exist.
---
&gt; classic
---
Pick one xD
---
Until you reach T3, where the first set bonus makes Rejuv absolutely worth having on your bar.
---
THANKS A LOT! Any info is welcome bro and I did not know elemental mages had this potential while leveling. Elemental is so fun that I am kinda sad I will have to spend my raiding days as frost. 
---
TBC ? I was almost sure it was in wotlk.
---
Well it is only a level worth of exp so it's very fast.
---
You have to group up in retail... good luck soloing mythics and raids...
---
You are fucking retarded, holy shit.
---
It's not gonna feel the same no. 
---
There's many great different priest specs tho and they are pretty fun.
---
Do you actually believe vanilla content/ skill ceiling is higher in vanilla than on live servers🤣
---
Did you even read the post I was replying to? 
---
Still not Viable. If your talking about
---
Having fun. Sure do whatever you want but there was 0 serious boomkins in vanilla not in raiding not in PvE.
---
No but they only have battle Rez on a 30 min cd
---
I remember killing monsters for hours and hours just to get up to 1 gold 
---
This is so epic, can't wait to play classic
---
Disclaimer : anything else than shadow is not a damage dealing build but a healing one. Welcome to Vanilla ;-)
---
I don't remember what I was specced on my priest alt in Vanilla but I think it was a cookie cutter holy build to heal in dungeons.
---
Don't forget in PVP as a healer you are the tank : stam &gt; \* 
---
So you take whatever talents boost your survivability, it will be a mix of holy and disc.
---
You won't have much time to use your mana anyway :D
---
Soon™ 
---
Sure you can raid as anything. You won’t be in a good raiding group though. You will be a b team or c team guy or an a team guy in a crap guild. Do what makes you happy but I know my stuff when it comes to vanilla. 
---
Overall though im not scared of ganking so much, more of PRIESTS AND SHAMANS.
---
Yes on both sides- 
---
While your cookie-cutter pve spec is holy it still puts 21 into the disc tree and Power Infusion builds are seen when you have plenty of healing and want to boost a caster’s dmg. Mages will literally suck yo dick for this.
---
You’ll see multiple builds in pvp that work for priest, one is going PI with some holy. Makes you tankier with a bigger mana pool and faster mana burns.
---
Other people are right saying there arn’t many pure builds but the disc tree plays a big role in vanilla 😁
---
Any thoughts on 1/29/21 vs 0/30/21? Dropping 1 point in HotW for Nature's Grasp has always seemed extremely worth it to me, but I only ever see people talking about 30/21. 
---
Just bring a ret paladin on your dungeon runs. Problem solved!
---
If you were poor or below level 20-25 then yeah it was the shit
---
Come to the dark side. We have cookies and scarier rogues :o
---
Great healers, terrible revivers.
---
Except what the community considers "passable" is idiotic. You can run through anything pre-AQ with half the raid being dancing boomkins if the rest of the raid is at the benchmark this community considers things usable.
---
Horde tho.
---
There will be more than enough tourists around to keep it interesting.
---
I doubt that having by now a pre-set group ready to go is anywhere near representative of the average player
---
This seems a bit overkill. The official retail minimum GPU is an Intel HD 530 which is far less powerful than 1050 ti and the minimum CPU a 6-year-old i5.
---
it really dosent, streamers dont have some magical way to ban people. just dont cheat or chant racist slurs on hes screen or in game you will be fine. no matter the reports
---
How did druids compare to priests for end game healing? 
---
IF there is something I feel that I am too old for it’s this big streaming scene. I really hope someone makes a list of where all streamers will play so I can avoid them. 
---
I really don’t get this culture of following a person to the extent that you would act like a private army. 
---
Took a good 2-4 days for me to gather 2 gold back at launch of Vanilla.
---
When you are focussing on dungeons then I very much suggest taking Feral Instinct over Thick Hide.
---
Thick Hide only gives you a very small mitigation bonus in bear form. Compare the 10% armor bonus to the 180% bonus of  Bear Form before lvl 40 and then the 360% bonus in Dire Bear Form after lvl 40. It is almost negligible. You are already tankier than 99% of the warriors while leveling with just having that spell. You can skip that talent even at 60 if you want to be a dedicated tank.
---
However an increase of 15% threat is no joke and scales incredibly well with any attack power (str) and crit (agi) you get along the way with talents and gear. If you join a dungeon group with a DPS that is higher level than you? No problem he can go full ham on your targets w/o worrying about aggro. Your healer doesn't get aggro on pulls either after you shout and swipe. It is basically the best tanking talent you can get from the feral tree. And again, no Warrior has the luxury of getting their threat talent in a leveling spec either.
---
Also it helps for open world PvP and questing when you want to by pass mobs especially when they are higher level because it doubles up as a stealth level increase.
---
Yeah you couldn't be more wrong. 
---
:P 2nd choice is warlock.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath on the young ones pulling through. They will try that 'classic everyone used to talk about' and only a handful will actually hang around for more than a month
---
Obviously it's been 14 years but I don't remember druids being remarkable while levelling - what's the deal? Just the kiting ability backed by melee?
---
Not worth going for. 
---
That’s fair, iirc Kings was the bottom talent in the Retribution tree for a while during Vanilla, it just isn’t the case in 1.12. 
---
Are you kidding? Not at 60 man
---
Pretty sure part of those features being stripped out was due to players getting more and more into min-maxing literally everything.
---
It certainly started at the end of TBC with the introduction of that ridiculous gear-score addon and suddenly people were asking what your score was before pugging heroics. (Heroics for christs sake!)
---
It only spread from there and suddenly if you weren't 100% optimal with talents, enchants, gems, reforge etc etc etc people just didn't want to play with you.
---
In turn Blizzard stripped away these features to make playing with other people less hassle. Sure they originally provided the options to min-max to a higher percent but it was the players that made it a requirement and a barrier to entry for newer/casual players.
---
It's completely understandable for progression guilds of the time, I certainly wasn't willing to take anyone on in the raid-team unless they had ticked all the boxes with regards to gear, talents, etc but some people took this as status quo for every aspect of the game, even casual dungeons.
---
Americans don't say Shahman, they say Shawman and Brits say Shayman. 
---
There is way more challenge in retail, mythic + itself is harder than anything in vanilla, and PVP is way more competitive due to esports, and obviously raids have way more mechanics, and classes have much tougher rotations now on average...
---
Not surprising. The trick is is basically repetition and a group of friends/guildies who do it with you. Way more fun and social than solo grinding, and very likely also more lucrative.
---
Beta.
---
We aren’t talking about end game. We are talking about the game as a whole in its current state
---
That’s when you kick the paladin.
---
So rank 14 is the .003% of server population, which for a blizzlike is 1 person on each faction. Private servers it’s 2 on each faction. So, while it may be easier, socially, to find yourself in the rank 14 grind, you’re competing with a somewhat equivalent ratio of people 
---
While it is true that ranking is based on server population, all the other shit is completely false I suggest you read up on the ranking system.
---
Yes and no. Requiring someone to bring consumables is an expectation of effort on their part. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect everyone in the raid to dedicate a little bit of time or gold to getting a handful of consumables.
---
It's a different thing entirely to tell someone to play something they don't want to play because it impacts on Guild progression. 
---
Consumable farming takes a small amount of time, playing a class you don't want to takes all of it.
---
There is a line but I don't think that's a good comparison.
---
I loved druid in wotlk, I'm thinking about rolling priest for classic because druid doesn't heal as well. Are you assigned to mostly tank healing? How would I fair being relatively casual in play time in terms of 5 man and gearing?
---
Disc priest with PI needs to be social. You need a team mate you can coordinate with to give PI.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnqJPU6M7KQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnqJPU6M7KQ)  This clip at 1:06 shows what PI disc priests do best. Coordinate with a elemental shaman, make him get bersi + trinket + PI and see him nuke WSG mid or some AB flag. 
---
PI priest is basically for an elemental shaman what an elemental shaman is for an arms warrior. An enabler making them nuke very hard.
---
Pretty sure the only reasons the Brits say "shayman" because the French say "shahman". 
---
I have a feeling they will release it June or July because there will be a lot of students that will play it so they can use the time while on summer break.
---
I used Foobar2000 back then.  
---
Still do, actually. &lt;\_&lt;
---
The young ones like me are typically pserver players who've played this game religiously for 2-4 years.
---
Those are the ones who's gonna be no life ranking.
---
DPS shaman or spriest then. 
---
In an IRL job absolutely, they just don't give a shit. But the youth will slave away in a video game without any problem ! 
---
I swear, if you could gamify it they would work 18 hours a day in a coal mine :D
---

---
Unbuffed preraid bis, what a nonsensical starting point for comparison.
---
I agree. Everything in it's proper time
---
Alright who is the 1 Priest that said they were gonna tank 
---
How long did it take you to count the exact amount of epics you had? Did you write down the number or do you remember it by heart?
---
Oh fuck off he said it by accident while playing a game, the reverse happens by the thousands and nobody says shit. You force people to defend him.
---
Honestly more than that, you can make 300g or more just selling a shitty piece of gear from an old raid in 5 mins 
---
The one thing that consistently makes my blood boil is when people underestimate how valuable a combat res can be, and ask me to burn it just so they dont have to run. 
---
I can kinda understand it if it's the tank that died - that's probably (at least partially) my fault, and the dungeon run is put on hold without them - but when a pure DPS asks for a res just to save 5 minutes of running? Shut the fuck up or get kicked. 
---
In the post you responded to I’m not talking about playing a different class to min-max.
---
Shadow 5 Life
---
To be fair let's keep in mind there were plenty of unsatisfied players during vanilla. Some people only played because wow was the big thing at the time, because their friends played or they enjoyed WC3 etc. 
---
A big part of the playerbase called for the QoL features/streamlining Blizzard later implemented. Eventually those players either moved on to the next big game, or stuck to retail because they actually liked the changes.
---
So maybe they actually played wow in 2005, but they did *in spite of* vanilla design. We want to play Classic in 2019 *because* of vanilla design. That's the big difference some of them can't wrap their minds around.
---
for glory and honor! 
---
Can you describe what top end resto raid healing looks like from vanilla? Is it just innervating the priests and dispelling? I’m going to play resto and want to know what to expect.
---
Shamzilla
---
We had two in our guild.  One of them had 48tp in holy.  Just because he wanted.  I know because he complained that he couldn’t spend all in holy.  ;)
---
Can't wait to fight me some horde scum.
---
Rogues also have the Poisons quest, which is very awesome 
---
Well, thing is, no serious roleplayer will do that. The issue with RP-PvP servers isn´t the roleplayers, it´s all the griefers.
---
In ideal world, there would be only roleplayers on RP-PvP servers and they would respect the fact that events happen (and would also be able to communicate cross-faction so they could let each other know "Hey, we are actually fighting a warlock and army of demons, keep that in mind when deciding if you attack us"). But this is not ideal world and non-RPers doing their world PvP is to me much more disruptive than the fact that, if my group meets Horde group, we can´t attack each other unless we both give consent.
---
But I understand that your preference may be different and there´s nothing wrong with that.
---
It's really hard to "suck" at Mage/Rogue. Mage you will just spam Frostbolt and Rogue is 3 buttons regardless if you play Swords or Daggers... but even subpar Mages and Rogues will be brought because they will still out DPS a try hard Ret/Enhance... and depending on stage a tryhard Kitty.
---
Mage spam the Frostbolt and decurse and if you pull aggro iceblock.
---
Rogue maintain slice n dice, backstab/sinister strike, evis and if you pull aggro vanish.
---
Warlock maintain w/e curse you are assigned and spam Shadowbolt and if you pull aggro use the soul stone we all know you put on yourself.
---
Hunter... be a lazy hunter and don't shot weave or be a try hard and shot weave
---
Kitty farm gnomer everyday for an endless supply of crowd pummlers and make sure you have ever buff possible
---
Ret/Enhance probably will be in the raid for Nightfall if an OT isn't doing it
---
Doomkin... lol
---
Fury just gotta make sure you are not constantly ripping aggro if you don't have a solid tank.
---
They are both very valid healers in PvP and PvE,  but perform different niches. It just chalks down to personal playstyle and what utility you want to be able have. 
---
I wouldn't say the quests are mandatory at all. I never do any of them and there are plenty of quests.
---
I think the issue with people playing "meme" specs is that a lot of them feel entitled to be carried in some way.  Those players will make arguments like "mc was ez", "don't need to buff" etc.  The way I see it is that if u want to play a sub-optimal spec, u need to at least be good at it, come fully buffed, know the class in and out and basically earn your raiding spot.
---
But the type of people who want to play these specs normally don't min/max and just want to dance around and get free gear, that's when people tell them to fk off and find another guild XD
---
Shaw-men
---
Yeah, followed in third place by the people in their 30s and 40s who actually played WoW in 2005. 
---
Anti-white hate crime of Jussie Smollett is one of the biggest stories and it was a hoax. How do YOU back up your skepticism? That's one example.
---
Pandas are the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a video game. I'll pay $15 to not see them ever again, also classic is just a better version of WoW than anything WOTLK-BFA could ever hope to be. 
---
If there is none I will uninstall.
---
I used to jerk off punks under the Ironforge AH Bridge for 15 silver a man. That reward right there is at least an hour or two of hard work, on a good day! It's certainly nothing to sneeze at, that's for sure.
---
Ah that’s fair enough. I’ve seen a few folk on official forums make that comparison.
---
sometimes they deserve it.
---
Yeah I was wondering who would ever use a CR like a normal res? You save that for emergencies.
---
2% of a horse
---
I'm not 100% of the system. I did it, so I should know. I am not sure if it takes server population . It was based off highest % honor gained . When I was in the guild members who were higher in ranking for Honor gained that week would slow down if someone  was a higher rank and slightly behind so they can position higher at the end of the week in order to rank up more for the week. It was a week by week thing. We had around 20 rank 13s and maybe 6 or so rank 14s. So people would rotate positioning to get the person to get past that threshold then would usually drop out of the "race".  If you had a HWL or GM who kept PvPing and kept getting that #1 or 2 spot it was frowned upon from the others because of the amount of people trying to rank. 
---
Ive only had 1 rank 13 a week on my server per facrion , but have heard there's been multiple befote. It does have to do with %s and increase in the current rank based off that weekly honor positioning, but couldn't really pin point what it is at this time. I know I placed top 10 a lot,  usually top 5 on my server almost weekly.
---
Well if you account for inflation...
---
Enhancement or elemental shaman could res for you then.
---
2 much math
---
logic dictates that they are currently milking every retail patch for 2 months with the help of time gating
---
8.1.5 just shipped and 8.2 got announced so they won't drop classic within the next 90-120 days as they already have two buns in the oven and they are going to milk those subs
---
\-
---
Reasoning behind this? Aside from the very obvious 2 sub month per patch tactic is that we know that classic will run under the retail subscription.
---
They have nothing to gain from delivering classic a single day sooner. Quite frankly - why would they? Because a couple hundred thousand users may play classic and only classic? The safe bet is to see classic as an alternative playground for the retail customers as that's a sensible business strategy for them.
---
Same goes for the classic 'phases'. People think they will power through them in just one and a half or two years. That won't be even close. The classic phases will get dropped whenever a content or subscription drought is happening for retail. 'Oh look here is some content to keep you busy'
---
and they will sell it to us as 'a good thing' because now players have more time to properly enjoy/experience all the fancy old raids.
---
The only chance for that to change is when the classic servers (through some miracle) end up populated and active enough to justify them to climb in priority. That would be nice to see, but I doubt it until I see it happening
---
Yeah you chakking blit n00b.
---
True, but vanilla hit the sweet spot between being most accessible to new comers and keeping as many RPG features as possible. 
---
It struck the right balance before Blizzard would have the time and resources to way over streamline the fun out of it eventually.
---
When you look at what the game has become and just how hostile Blizzard has been to legacy servers for so long, honestly I think they pulled a George Lucas with Classic. They made something great without quite understanding what specifically made it great. Wouldn't be surprised if many at Blizzard still don't get it
---
I hate to say this but I’m a little biased against Druid healers because of this unless there’s another hybrid in the group. 
---
Right on!
---
I never said it wasn't valuable, I just said it wasn't necessary with mace spec because... it really isn't. But again, it comes down to what you prefer. I don't see how any of what I said is wrong.
---
Can I see those polls? I'm just curious. If you have the links ofc
---
Be warned, vanilla shaman has a slightly smaller toolkit than tbc! No water/earthshield, totemic recall or bloodlust/heroism. And no talent to make a portion of +heal turn into spell damage making grinding outside of raids tougher. My tbc resto shaman could be an aoe farming monster and could solo the fel reaver in hellfire. My vanilla resto shaman at 60 struggles to kill green lvl 50 mobs
---
Realistically, how many sets of gear do you need to be a good level 60 Druid who wants to heal and be able to dps/off-tank?
---
No bloodlust? Seriously!?
---
Okay, you tell me what .003% of 1500 people is. Or is this [Staysafe video] (https://youtu.be/AMmkS6L4Qp4) also complete bullshit?
---
The quests starts some really long and good questlines that's why.
---
&gt; Don't put too much hope in the arcanite reaper, its useful life will be way shorter than in Vanilla (for PVP anyway).
---
&gt; By the time you gather the mats, people will already be farming BWL.
---
It will definitely be less popular this time around due to all the better or close-enough alternatives, but they are rolling out the content patches in phases so BWL and Dire Maul won't be available for the first six months or so. Also, people won't be able to cascade instances so each guild will only get a handful of MC 2-handers per week.
---
Oh man, that brings back memories. I also did that to Horde with my Draenei priest. But it was rather ... iffy ... to use the same trick on players of approximately equal level since their health bar length is a percentage of their maximum health. And PW:Fort only increases their maximum health, it doesn't heal their current health. So the bar shrinks and they thing that you just damaged them, and hence attack.
---
Also that little feature of PW:Fort just increasing the max health without affecting the current health can be used in a rather nasty way. There's an elevator in Shattrath where it's possible to jump off the top and just \_barely\_ survive. And if you as a priest are at the top of the elevator and cast a PW:Fort on a player just as they're running off because they're impatient.... Well, just remember that fall damage is a percentage of your maximum health. 
---
For more information, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMmkS6L4Qp4
---
You can cast instant spells while MCing another player. Of course, that immediately broke the MC, but the instant cast spell on the "friendly" target already landed.
---
Talking about PvP
---
I need about tree fiddy
---
I think I was 17 around the time I did the PvP grind. I started playing 2006 ? And seriously in 2007 so I was on the later half of the vanilla experience. I'll definitely will be back for classic. 
---
Who yells out “n*gger” accidentally? THATS NOT NORMAL. Don’t try to normalize it.
---
Was him wearing Nazi uniforms and making anti-semetic jokes accidental too? 
---
this is good enough to be it's own post lmfaoo
---
All things considered if you’re a well skilled player,you can heal efficiently as a Druid or priest. When it comes to rating you’ll probably be assigned to group healing and off tank healing until you become more skilled and then you can be put on MT healing. That is completely group dependent and fight dependent. 5 man should be just fine, no worries. Casual play will be fine. Priest is easier at 5 man healing when you’re leveling. Hope this helps, let me know if you have other questions.
---
LOL WHAT
---
It's not 0.003%, it's 0.3% and that is for BRACKETS, not ranks.
---
0.003*1500 = 4.5, this means if there's 1500 people with 15 hk's on the server it's about 2 bracket1 spots per faction, however while the server CAP of vanilla servers was around 2500, that is not the same thing as bracket spots. Concurrent players is not the same as total players, and of course not everyone gets 15hk's every week.
---
Watch the video again my man
---
[I made it to 60, but didn't last long after that so not sure how well this applies to me.](https://i.imgur.com/tXtolic.png)
---
Gonna give it  a look now. For someone who actually spent all of his time PvPing and ranking and never officially knowing, I'm an idiot for not giving deeper. Just a quick press it mentioned honor gaining players. Kinda like I thought. So it's the % of people gaining honor. Not the entire population. I'll give it a look now, thanks! 
---
&gt;Think of Vanilla as a work of art (because it fucking is): a run-down painting would not be remade by some douche who puts his own artistic spin on it; it would be restored as close to its former glory as humanly possible. 
---
Whilst I could agree with everything you've said, this last part made me realize you're biased and have no idea how many douches attempt to recreate classic works of art.
---
You've clearly forgotten about the restoration of jesus christ (not our green jesus thrall), google botched ecce homo or even jesus restoration.
---
This was approved by the Vatican!
---
Just like how Activision has approved classic WoW!
---
Only good side is because classic isn't for profit yet, blizzard will have all the reign of control regarding it.
---
&gt;Prot paladins have tanked everything in the game.
---
First off, that's literally impossible - there are bosses whose mechanics require a taunt. Secondly, if fairly well informed when it comes to unconventional paladin specs and I haven't seen a single protadin pull off even a quarter of all 40-man bosses. However, if you've got evidence to the contrary, feel free to post it.
---
Wow i always assumed every class had complicated intricacies and you super boiled it down there. Thanks very much for the detailed response.
---
S-ham-an. Ham-san.  Ham sandwich.
---
Don't they pronounce it shay-men in some cultures, or is that plural?

(no OP) What do you mean is it just that? You make it sound like a druid is a support class that doesn't heal or is useless. You heal almost as much as a priest although you lack the bubble and a fast heal so spell cancelling is way more important. Druids with the rejuvenation talents will usually try to keep a rejuv up at all time on the MT on hard bosses. Regrowth is really mana expensive so you don't use it much but it's fast and can provide another hot on phases where you know the tank will take a lot of damage. Also yes you innervate the priests, not because they are better healers but because it's more efficients, druids will have more +mp5 on gear than priests because priests benefit a bonus +healing from spirit. More spirit oriented regen means more mana regen from innervate. Also battle res makes druids the best healer class ;)
---
What type of content in vanilla was more difficult than mythic +?
---
I'm thinking of rolling a full set of race/gender combos and having all 8 available classes. My initial thoughts are
---
1. Female Night Elf - Hunter.
---
2. Male Night Elf - Druid (will never make Male Night Elf hunter due to feign death and death animation).
---
3. Female Dwarf - Priest.
---
4. Male Dwarf - Rogue.
---
5. Female Gnome - Warlock (make character as cute looking as possible).
---
6. Male Gnome - Mage.
---
7. Female Human - Paladin.
---
8. Male Human - Warrior.
---
Then of course a bank alt. Thinking bank alt should be human since easiest race to get to Iron Force AH without having to die (trogg cave at Dwarf/Gnome starting area annoying at level 1 and still has a LONG run to IF. Humans can take Deeprun Tram after getting to Stormwind. Don't even think of Night Elf and run through Wetlands).
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
Dwarf is master race idk why people can't understand that.
---
That's still not the main issue, although I agree that it's problematic. The main issue with prot paladins is bad mitigation (no flat dmg reduction like defensive stance, subpar gear), no defensive cooldowns and insufficient TPS.
---
Nothing better than some wpvp when you get bored of leveling and need a break. 
---
From OP's post I assumed they wanted to have worry-free good performance.
---
So like I say, an i5 + 1050 Ti is probably the threshold for that. As well as just generally being a decent laptop for other things.
---
An HD 530 might be the "official minimum", but is a complete piece of garbage that can barely run anything.
---
If one is in the market for a laptop without a dedicated GPU, then AMD's offerings are massively better.
---
The R5 3550H with Vega 8, for example, is around 2x the speed of the HD 530 Intel graphics, but is still only good for around 720p medium settings most of the time.
---
Yeah, not gonna lie... I had completely forgotten about the lightwell...
---
Why not both?
---
It'll be harder. Players are a lot better, more hardcore, and more knowledgeable on gaming the rank system now.
---
I'd add Strat Live with orbs reserved. We did that a lot on Nostalrius as tank+healer with 3 random DPS, and we made around the same as we did in 2man DME jump runs. The variation really boosts the motivation. 
---
THis is exactly how I “justified” playing on a private. I ALREADY PAID for WoW 1.12, so I want to play it.
---
Having like 5g at something like level 30 was rich back then I think I remember.
---
One of my goals in Classic Wow was to join the worst PUG and heal them through the dungeon.  It taught me more than I ever realized about who to heal, when to play defense, and mana control.
---
That being said, there have been a few groups at a lower level wherein there has been a wipe.
---
"Run back, boys -- I didn't have enough money to train resurrection!"
---
My pet peeve, when the entire group wipes, it's usually only the healer that has to run back.  Get moving, especially in case of repops, aggro, etc.  
---
You went in as a group, died as a group, and you resurrect as a group.
---
You know, now that I rethink my interpretation of this, you might be right: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics
---
*To be fair...*  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
If you're not very integrated about the game's mechanics and you only quest without ever grouping for an instance, then you probably won't ever miss rez.
---
Dude, that's like, 360 gold on retail.
---
Farming dungeons for 30-50g/h while drinking beer and sharing life stories is seriously so much fun. I envy anyone who hasn't experienced it. 
---
Technically both. Revive was introduced in TBC's final patch 3.0 "Echoes of Doom", Wrath of the Lich King's pre-expansion patch that introduced LK talents trees and new skills.
---
Please keep pushing them further and further right, just keep making every other habitat too hostile for them. I don't have to normalize normal behavior, you cannot scrub people's brains. They can see your double standards and will not forget. Remember when the left wing elected Trump, they still don't understand that.
---
You'd fit in well with the dark souls community. "Just get gud lol"
---
Biggest issue I saw with Guns was on PvP servers. On a PvP server, one key thing is discovering that someone of the opposite faction was nearby before they discovered that you were nearby. If you noticed them first, you could make the decision to evade, or attack. And with guns being so noisy, it was easy to detect an opposite faction hunter using a gun whereas if the hunter was using a bow, you wouldn't notice them. Also as a note for hunters, be careful when you use Hunter's Mark. Yes, it increases your damage. But it also announces your presence as well.
---
all our 6 priests are Disc there is absolute no point in beeing holy besides maybe the first 3 IDs of MC after you hit 60 because your gear will be shit but even then you probably drop Spiritual Healing for Mental Strength. So yeah its not even viable its is pretty much meta.
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers 😬
---
Won't be any -- we'll all be over in Hillsbrand Foothills, doing the ol' SS/TM shuffle.
---
So true!
---
Ive seen it happen a few times, its like 20 min corpse run and then u gotta run from darkshore again when youre alive since u cant fly up. Also youre horde so no flightpath in darkshore
---
I’m playing on a Wrath private server right now. I used Divine Protection on another paladin to save a wipe, and that’s how everyone found out he didn’t do the res quest yet. 
---
i5-series got released in 2009 so it's ambiguous to say just i5 when there are 9 generations in between.
---
Come back when Hogger kicks your ass...
---
preraid bis, mc/bwl bis and FULL bis.
---
All 3 are there. Of course you start at unbuffed. whatever the hell kind of stupid baseline do you think it should be based off?
---
Hurr durr full consumes, buffs from every class and all world buffs ofc, anything else is literally unplayable hurhurhurhur
---
It’s funny, I’ve seen a lot of people asking these types of questions. Resto druid is a very versatile raid healer. You’ll be using a lot of your hots and healing touch. You will group heal, you will off tank heal, you will main tank heal. Decursing will be a big part of certain fights and you will need to be on it immediately. I don’t know why everyone thinks druids just innervate priests. I rarely recall innervating our priests, we did have good priests though who weren’t going oom or over healing. When it comes to needing to innervate other healers, it really comes down to the group build, skill of players involved and the specific fight. I often found myself even innervating top chart spell DPS in fights where speed was an issue. Please let me know if you need more clarification- sorry my wife is typing this while I’m driving. 
---
You misspelled “Best questing circuit”
---
Ashenvale is pretty hated by alliance so its usually horde dominated very early on.
---
Objectively, worse. Less mana-efficient heals, more threat, no res, no magic dispell (particularly important in PvP). As a tank I'd take a priest over a druid any time and in PvP having either a priest or a paladin is mandatory to dispell the ridiculous amount of CCs available in vanilla.
---
But I just killed Jaina in LFR on the first try, there is nothing hard in retail! /s
---
😂
---
If I'm providing any of these I'm probably expecting raw cash as a tip rather than mats - if someone gives you a clutch port throw em a gold plus cost of the portal reagent, if it's a larger crafting thing I might do between 2-5g.
---
Then again, I am an overtipper IRL...
---
Heavily depends on what item at time in the server progression.  
---
First Arcanite reaper? 50g. 
---
First lionheart and titanics? easy 100-150g
---
First crusader? 20g+ 
---
First +30 SP? 50-100g.
---
^ This, they won't be able to play in a pvp server, people will be on their backs all day.
---
I was in progression raiding guild when I was 15 in high school in vanilla... I don’t think a level 10 quest is equivalent in difficulty LOL.
---
I think whenever they feel they got it set. The target market has been dedicated to the game for a long ass time and past many, many mmo launches.
---
Their goal is to have the prod version be completely set. 
---
Yes sure they have potential but the reality is non hardcore won't top dps with a warrior. Lot of people end up dissapointed at max level because of the amount of effort they have to put to gear.
---
Having the goblin guards one shot you for being a innocent bystander 😂😂😂
---
You missed the point of the joke, and that's fine, because that's something you'll experience again in classic. Missing. A lot.
---
Tipsout called for his stream to report a player that "Was harassing his dueling tournament" the dude was instantly banned. It has already happened. These asshat streamers are just going to abuse there power.
---
Portals are 1g, 50s if leveling.
---
Rest is more like fees rather than tips, talk with your crafter. Typically gold is the preferred currency. 
---
Hearing that thump sound and shitting your pants knowing someone targeted you 😲
---
Adam Egret??
---
Good to know—thank you!
---
This guys had a good answer👍
---
Yes and you had to get your 5g up to 100 for your mount at 40, which was a real chore. 
---
By the forgefather's beard...
---
A true believer
---
was the dude actually causing harrasment tho? if you go on argent dawn and start harrassing rp'ers you will get a ban too. 
---
I had no idea the spell would still land after you broke MC.  I mostly used it for defending the lumber mill.
---
Alot. I had full bags and maxed out bank full
---
Of hear. Over 6 sets at least. Lots of random pieces.
---
You get the Zul'Farrak quest for Carrot on a Stick in SF. Best trinket in the game. Can't miss that!
---
Disc priest? 
---
Of course, some guilds of higher quality could consider Power Infusion/Shadow Weaving hybrid spec priest to kill 2 birds with one stone to make both Ignite mages and warlocks happy. 
---
But it is not that common and as it's already been said - discipline in vanilla is very different from wotlk.
---
Which fights would you avoid and which fights would you pick in wpvp as a feral? Im planning 8n playing a cat for wpvp only and i am not interested in raiding. Do you have any insight of feral for me because the only reason i want to play feral is because it looks cool and i like that you can switch to travel bear cat forms and playstyles. But honestly i have no idea about ferals and only read that they doesnt do well wich concerns me a bit 
---
I had my first release PvP encounter in Ashenvale. I was running up the hill between the hut near the Darkshore border and Astranaar. At the top I saw a ghost wolf running towards me. The shaman was a few levels higher than me. I turned into a bear and met him head-on, then instantly died as he came out of wolf form and hit me with a barrage of Windfury hits.
---
&gt;Try vanilla raiding without your ludicrously powerful retail class "talents" (as in the newer abilities, not talent tree concept) again and experience the difference.
---
Yeah it took a real pro to press Frostbolt or Shadowbolt for 4 hours. 
---
What about during levelling? (Such as a weapon or armor upgrade at lvl 40 or so.)
---
Haha same, but still can’t wait to play it again
---
Yea I tend to be an overtipper as well... But considering I'd rather not go bankrupt ;)
---
I used DI on another Paladin during a Garr wipe...
---
Paladin had no idea what happened and was waiting for DI to wear off(3 minutes) when the raid leader asked if the Paladin had DI and she said it looked stupid so never trained it. 
---
I ultimately found the whole experience to be thrilling. However, I distinctly remember slow fall jumping into the crater as my first time entering the zone. I was too low to handle anything there, and I ended up getting chased very deep in. Fun times :)
---
Ok. Doesn't change the fact that Warriors are the most popular class on private servers while Druids are the least popular.
---
Yes! I remember seeing that and being like “I can’t afford that shit! I’m not made of money!?” 
---
Am not!
---
Remember by heart and yes I did count them. I had a terrible flaw in vanilla. I was the epitome of a loot whore. The only item I didn’t get that I wanted was the feral mace from AQ 40, but I was lucky enough to
---
Get the hammer of bestial Wrath off of a world dragon so I was pretty much set there. 
---
During leveling you really, really want to keep your gold to yourself. 
---
Save up for level 40 mount, once level 40, save up for epic mount.
---
Having an epic mount + spurs + enchant really makes you appreciate it running away from ganker/wPvPer/wPvPrankers.
---
I really only would consider dumping gold into an executioners cleaver at level 43 *if* you already got your mount. Buying it for 40g, it easily holds up to level 60 for leveling.
---
The point of being specific about the GPU covers this.
---
Any i5 paired with a 1050 Ti will be fine. It's impossible to find a terribly out of date i5 paired with a modern GPU.
---
I didn't want to over-complicate it by throwing loads of codenames out there.
---
From what I understand getting to around Rank 10 will be doable for your average player if they can put in a few hours a night and hit up some BG weekends more seriously.
---
From Rank 11 upwards it becomes increasingly more difficult to get into that rank, with Rank 14 being essentially reserved exclusively for people who PvP as a full time job.
---
I think at the beginning the HoT had to be channeled too
---
It's gonna be amazing!
---
No mention of Ashenvale? Good, good. No one will expect my rogue jump at them in a crossroad.
---
Classic.
---
Legit 
---
They’ll be a cake walk because we aren’t carrying rets who are getting beat on dps charts by the tank. 
---
People will be able to clear everything and bring rets along if they want, but all the top guilds will have a no meme spec rule for sure because we don’t wanna carry. Plenty of great guilds will allow that tho so it’s less about who’s right overall and more about who you are gunna play with 
---
I feel like the shuriken should be the release date.
---
First, it wasnt an RP server. Second, you can't just claim an area is yours and say nobody is allowed in the ring while they fight. And I'm pretty sure it's against TOS to give away money for ingame tournaments like that. But blizzard doesn't mind turning their head the other way when it's free advertising.
---
On a private server my old guilds best priest was human and we had a NE priest who was amazing. Race doesn’t really matter as much as specs do, dwarfs are nice but I totally get people not wanting to play a dwarf lol they’re so ugly
---
Well if you are a tauren, I prefere the extra point in hotw as you have stomp to land an entangle
---
I really miss going all out on elite/rare mobs and using all my cooldowns + kiting to kill them. I miss that challenging aspect, was so satisfying to solo mobs that needed 2-3 people recommendations. I felt that in the late game island during MoP, but that was it.
---
I also loved the scale of the game. So much open land to marvel at it's beauty and room to breathe. It felt adventurous, looking for small nooks and crannies. You can really feel the distance when travelling between different areas. No other game made me feel like this way, the immersion of playing in an new world. All the expansions felt very condensed and while they had nice areas, you can't take two steps without encountering something.
---
Big difference between group and organizational skill and personal skill. So far as I remember tanks didn’t have unlimited threat without skill and and healers didn’t have unlimited mana either. I’ve run out of mana maybe three times since cata and two of those were because I was trying to run down my mana on a target dummy. I literally sucked until cata then suddenly I was the best healer or rank people had had all day just from spamming one or two abilities.
---
1 point Nature's Grasp is pretty weak in Vanilla. You have to leave Bear Form to cast it, it costs mana to use, and at only a 35% chance to proc, it's not at all reliable. I don't think it's worth taking as a Feral/Resto hybrid spec.
---
Nature's Swiftness + Roots is your emergency peel in that build. Leave Nature's Grasp to the deep Feral and deep Resto builds.
---
What were the pre-battlegroup BG queues like? My battlegroup in Vanilla contained Moonglade (RP) and you'd rarely ever see them PVPing. I'd be tempted to roll on an RP-PVP server but only if there are cross-realm BGs. 
---
Its not even about it being good cause parts of it are objectively bad(game balance being the worst offender imo). Its about actually putting RPG back into MMORPG. I cant wait for my loot to matter, for world to feel alive again, for classes to be diverse(even with the balancing issues I mentioned)
---
just tell them "red equals dead" and roll Alliance.
---
I'd say 2000g
---
I mean, have you ever tried to kill a fully plate healer that is capable of no push back on healing spells. Better hope you have a silence because holyshit are you in for a ride.
---
Why is everyone saying 1.8 gold was a lot back then? It's a lot until you're level 25 or something, then it's pretty easy to farm that amount in under an hour. And if you're high enough level to run scholomance then that should be almost nothing to you unless you've been blowing all your gold on AH blues and hate farming.
---
Monsterslaying talent for hunters increases damage and I think crit aswell? And there's an axe from ZG that gives like 100 attack power vs dragonkin.
---
TipsOut, although I do like his deep dives

And that was back when coke was made with cocaine so even better.

It's too fold for me. I'm tired of all the extra bullshit RNG in current retail WoW, and I really want to play an authentic TBC server. If Classic is successful then maybe in 6 years a TBC server will be launched, so I've thrown my lot in with the Classic community.
---
Just did a quick search on wowhead and I find it rather amusing. They have 38 screen shots of characters wearing those robes. The races represented are:
---
Blood Elf - 16 times
---
Human - 8 times
---
Draenei - 6 times
---
Night Elf - 2 times
---
Orc - 2 times
---
Troll - 2 times
---
Undead - 1 time
---
Goblin - 1 time
---
Didn't see any Tauren, Gnomes, Worgen, or Dwarves.
---
Wonder why?
---
World Pvp as feral is very fun. You are going to want to pick your fights like a rogue would. Sneak is key. Get on a guy when he is weak or not expecting you too. I loved world Pvp as a feral Druid. Going stealth is one of
---
The most underrated aspects of being a Druid.
---
I have no way of telling what server soda or asmond will be on but I intend to stay as far away from those servers as possible.
---
If I'm below level 50-60 and want a portal, I'd either buy the reagent (40s) and give it to the mage  +10 silver tip, or just give them 50-60 silver if it's super urgent.
---
Notice I said below 50, which implies emphasis on leveling and saving up for mounts/skills.
---
On 60 I think maybe 80s up to 1g is plenty a tip for a portal. If I was a mage I'd be happy with just a reagent and 5-10s tip, since I know I'm doing my part and helping others travel around Azeroth safely ;)
---
It took a lot of grinding and a loan from my brother who was 60 already (think about 25g)
---
What are you basing this off of? I certainly won’t be optimizing with my Gnome Warrior. I certainly will be playing solo and will still get exactly the same social experience if I want it.
---
What spec were you in PvP, and what gear did you use for it? From looking at online videos, it's a lot of effort to kill folks. Also, as a freshly dinged 60 Druid with a goal to PvP a lot, what's the best route to gear, and what's the best spec to go? Whore yourself out as a healer in HOTW spec to get some pre-raid BiS and then some raid purples? 
---
Hillsbaghdad Foothills
---
Stonetiraq Mountains
---
Blafghanistan Lands
---
&gt;Big difference between group and organizational skill and personal skill.
---
All of them are higher in retail unless you can provide examples otherwise.
---
&gt;So far as I remember tanks didn’t have unlimited threat without skill 
---
What skill? Bosses were tanked by spamming Sunder Armor, there was nothing complicated about it. It punished bad players while it had no effect on good players.
---
&gt; healers didn’t have unlimited mana either
---
They don't now either? Even if we pretend that's true, healers now have infinitely more mechanics to consider other than mana, it was cheap gameplay 15 years ago.
---
&gt; I’ve run out of mana maybe three times since cata and two of those were because I was trying to run down my mana on a target dummy
---
I don't know what content you are running but I'm gonna assume nothing hard. 
---
&gt;I literally sucked until cata then suddenly I was the best healer or rank people had had all day just from spamming one or two abilities.
---
Best based on what?
---
You do realize that for every hardcore Classic player, there’s probably 2 more people playing for the first time, correct? Seems silly to me to believe that this EBTIRE WORLD will be dominated by minmaxers. That’s just not happening. 
---
I saw it as the release date throwing classic at me, but either way works tbh
---
My sons computer got a R9-390 and a I5-760 it works perfectly well in 1080p or lower.  As long as you don’t need above hd levels it can do the job.  
---
(I upgraded the graphics card when the old one died in that rig).   I know it’s not the newest card but it’s same connector, same technology as 1050 card

Well, in Vanilla, humans have the most OP PvE racial. Diplomacy.
---
In Vanilla, there's one hell of a lot of rep grinding. And having a 10% bonus to reputation will eliminate many hours of said grinding.
---
I would suggest getting a keyboard as well. 
---
Well, at lv1. When you're running Scholo vendoring 2 grey weapons is more money than that quest
---
No idea, they definitely look better on female night elf, and are also quite good piece of gear for healers.
---
My theory is that RP-PvP servers will eventually settle into an RP centered way of operating as opposed to the typical PvP server way, STVietnam/"Hillbrad cuz it's convenient" etc. Just seems that over time the RP influence would win out because it's more fun and interesting. First few years might be an uphill battle though.
---
I think it's a healthy mix of ignorance and circlejerk. 2g is literally 1 grey item sold at lv60
---
&gt;Will it feel the same if I play it in Classic?
---
No, not at all. Disc, like many other specs, where very very different in wrath compared to vanilla. 
---
I've heard so many variations throughout the years, and among nonnative tongues even more spread. Then we have the 'man' vs 'men' angle. 
---
Hopefully more like 3. Wotlk in 6 :)
---
The mana you get from it is dependent on your Mana regen. Priests won't get any more mana from it than a mage/shaman/druid with similar spirit.
---
Yeah, some of us have fun playing what we like in a GAME hahaha! Imagine making any class work over an easy one that has everything handed to you haha!
---
Hopefully your tv is above 1080p otherwise it would look much better on a normal monitor.
---
where is my mark, bear-kun?
---
I cant say I agree with your Less mana-efficient heals point. R4 Healing Touch is objectively the most mana efficient heal in the game.
---
Nothing better than that alliance/horde dude just leaving you be since you both just want to do your quests and be on your way. 
---
During leveling, remember that you're gonna be replacing your gear when you reach 60 anyway. Why waste the gold when you're gonna be needing it for your mount at 40 and 60? And for leveling, there's no need to have the absolute best gear possible. Because once again, remember that you're going to be replacing your gear by the time you reach 60.
---
Imagine saying that to a goblin.
---

Sub to one of the ClassiCast guys, they usually upload a new video right after anything Classic related comes out.
---
I like this alot, cheers for your time and thoughts on it man :)   
---
Sometimes we dont need pretty charts but just a nice read through ! :) 
---
Every class in Vanilla has class quests and every class will have a class quest that sends them into the Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Sunken Temple). You might consider that instance to be a rite of passage for every class.
---
The objective of the corporation isn't to make a great game. It's to make greater profits.
---
IMO it's still more confusing not to mention anything more than i5 or i7.
---
20% bro 
---
My favorite is when they ask you to retroactively soulstone the dead healer and res them. This isn't retail bud.
---
Go with personal preference if you want but as a 2h warrior, especially without flurry, you are gaining maybe 1 rage every 6-7 seconds, if you’re lucky. 10 rage per minute, if you’re lucky. Very underwhelming 
---
You ain't got no life, you ain't got no friends and I know you want to spend your weekend with 39 strangers and some guy named Bob telling you what to do!
---
I'm seeing someone suggest up top that Patch 1.12 (where we will be entering Classic) had Mind Control now breaking it earlier than pre-1.12.
---
Must research for myself, as well.
---
I remember how hard it was to get 1 g during vanilla.  Believe me, 1g is a ton lol.
---
.... Fun?
---
No amount of willpower or indignant wishing will make the extremely sub-par specs do more than 1/5 the dps of competitive specs. It won't give prot pallies a taunt, or non-dwarf priests fear ward.

That's what we said about Half Life 3
---
It was one of the pvp hotspots during early leveling in vanilla
---
Hey, back then I BARELY made 55 silver after repairs and blacksmithing mats. That was a lot of money to me
---
Definitely. It helps a lot of have an Elixir of Water Breathing, or a warlock friend with you.
---
You can legitimately get grand marshal without a keyboard. Just saying. 
---
You're talking about a desktop PC though, much more powerful than a laptop in general.
---
Also the R9 390 is more powerful than even a desktop 1050 Ti.
---
Barov peasant caller
---
pretty sure if you follow someone around using rank 1 fireblast you eventually talk to a GM.
---
More .2% of a fast horse
---
How is it? It comes across that you're trying to nitpick my advice for no reason.
---
Any i5 + a 1050 Ti that you can find will be a decent laptop for WoW, and a lot of other things.
---
And OP stated they wanted to spend the least money as possible. Thus the implication is find the cheapest i5 + 1050 Ti you can, and it'll do the job fine (and this is true).
---
Ok, nevermind then, don't get a keyboard OP, not worth it. 
---
Reported for not being about classic wow
---
Druid are the last resort for healer
---
Everyone overlooks this. The pirate hats in MC for the lulz meme was very real back then, only like 15 competent players needed to be in a raid.
---
Only if they also delay the Classic release date to November 2020 for the same transition.
---
Are you guys set on that guild name? :P
---
Eh, I don't want to get in a debate. I really wasn't doing what you think.
---
 Why not just go disc and spam bubble tho? Disc was extremely overpowered by the time you got to t12 heroic/t13 and they had powerword:barrier for cheesing raid mechanics.
---
Oh I definitely understand that. More than once I've had to tell the group, "You've gotta run. The trash has respawned and I'm not gonna be able to get past them." I've also contemplated on leveling a new warlock to NOT learn the Ritual of Summoning. Would be nice to tell the lazy bastards, "Oh, Sorry, I didn't have the gold to learn how to summon. Looks like you gotta run here yourself."

Some of the best PvP was in classic. Flying mounts ruined world PvP as everyone just went AFK in the skies and the only people you could find on the ground were low levels trying to gain EXP. 
---
I dont even think hes supposed to give you any gold for this quest. Im pretty sure this was after the patch (like 1.11 or 1.12?) where it converted XP to gold at level 60.
---
For casual play would you mainly play resto ?
---
Seems feral Is not a spec you can half ass and be decent.

I mean the mechanics was never the hard part of raiding in vanilla. It was the itemization. Classes were weak as fuck barely any aoe heals, needed resistance gear, hours of farming consumables. 
---
your still gonna be as shitty as you were back then because your class will be just as shitty as it was back then.
---
For your first point, we’re now stuck in a “prove your claim first” loop. Second point, tanking isn’t just running up to one enemy and beating it to death in many cases. Additionally, have you heard of Blood Boil? Avenger’s Shield? The like? Third and fourth, soloing dungeons where every enemy is levels above me posed little challenge whatsoever  on a priest and never ran out despite needing constant heals and dealing damage when I wasn’t healing for up to 15 minutes at a time for some encounters. And five, based on that I asked for feedback after every dungeon for a while and got no complaints, in addition to consistent praise before any questions asked, saved fights, never lost aggro, went quick enough for the new people but fast enough for the more rushing types. And that’s just tanking. Healing I kept people topped while getting to second in damage constantly, could handle unexpected damage increases, could keep everyone alive even with a shit tank. 
---
To expand, though. Have you thought about how a game is the sum of its parts and not just about the endgame? Because the first 59 levels used to be content, not a barrier to be jumped over in a few days of normal play. Even if the endgame is great and poses real challenges since I quit retail (just into legion) and I’m just completely out of the loop, the entire rest game itself is laughably easy and they hand out levels like US doctors prescribe opioids.
---
Yes and yes 
---
Sounds like you're describing a PVE server. 
---
https://youtu.be/M-D-wW_Sdvc?t=18m00s
---
You are actual garbage, or so out of touch with reality that you can't function in it. No one gives a fuck about imaginary internet points, real world if far more consequential. You need to grow up kid.
---
Omg are you guys srsly?  Depression is real and you need sunshine and exercise. /s
---
Depends very heavily on how spawns and sharding works rly.
---
It's always hard to predict these things.
---
You do have to advertise for sure but if you raise it high enough you’ll make plenty of money. If anything, I would say the argument against leveling enchanting would be that you’re making less money while you level since you’re breaking down greens and such instead of vendoring them
---
&gt; I really like mobile single target burst in PvP. For ranged, I love kiting and (when ignored) being able to turret and blow up squishies. Is one better for this? 
---
Mage is easier to kite with. Hunters are better at turreting and bursting at low gear levels. 
---
&gt; I wonder if Mage isn't actually just better at turreting up and deleting targets 
---
With better gear, they can turret easier, in the beginning not so much.
---
&gt; Are both comparable for single target deletion (when geared)? 
---
Yes, but a lot of classes are at high gear levels. 
---
Since you seem to be a fan of the hunter class fantasy, that's what I would go with. That being said, there are some major differences between the classes at each tier. Mages pre-raid and in MC have a low health pool and middling damage, but they can still kite and burst like no ones business. However, hunters can also burst quite easily

These numbers should by no means be taken as gospel. They're averages from a private server using a target dummy. The basic principle should be the same in classic and is shown in the data that mages scale better than hunters. I only used the first two tiers of comparison because they're the most relevant for most people. In the later tiers mage starts to get ridiculous with spell crit and damage. 
---
Oh, I was thinking the release date was just a dopamine spike while we keep waiting.
---
You see, I don't even care for the fear ward or 5% spirit. I care about the 10% rep gains and desperate prayer. If I roll NE I'll have neither, and I hate that. What should I do ;_;
---
Thanks!
---
Yes, but add the rage from Anger Management and suddenly that extra is not so bad.
---
I play feral/resto hybrid and I do take 1 point on NG, but only because i'm a Night Elf AND I don't have  engineering, thus I think it's really worth for a couple reasons:
---
When a melee opens on you on wPVP, theres basically a few options to get into a safe range/run away, you either shapeshift into bear to Bash-root-run/heal/re-engage or you NG and run while praying for an easy proc (a lot of times NG will proc  when you are first hit since 35% at level 1 is still a lot of chance, and if you are dueling vs. dual wielders they usually get rooted pretty easily too). Casting Roots or Heals on melee's face isn't really a option. The third options relies on engineering stun bombs (as a lore-guided player, I would never pick eng as a Druid, so this is no option for me). The thing is, if a Druid gets opened by a Rogue/Warr and your Bash misses or gets dodged you are dead. Warrs will spam Hammstring, so even if you spam forms, believe me, you won't be able to outrun a Warr on 1 vs. 1 just by shapeshifting in and out of travel form. Rogues are even worse, because they have passive slows and are faster then you w/ Sprint, also having tons of dodge, making Bash super unreliable against them. By having 1 point on NG you just get a total new tool that's add a pretty good chance of surviving both of these popular classes.
---
Again, Taurens don't really need this lvl 1 NG because they have Stomp so if I was playing a tauren I would actually have +9% HP extra considereing tauren's racial plus 5/5 instead of 4/5 on Heart of the Wild (you can consider tauren's superior base Stamina too if you want). This actually represents a lot of HP when you are into Bear form. I consider Tauren resto Druid a lot superior then NE for any PVP purposes really, also because you don't have to deal w/ f\*\*\*\*\*\* Purges.
---
Hunters have scatter shot which is an interupt 
---
Idk. Admittedly I watched a bunch of Asmogold rumbling videos. 
---
I watched a ton of Vanilla theorycrafting videos. 
---
Will I watch Asmogold play Classic? Heck no, that's giga-boring.
---
I agree with most people in the replies and would like to add that the "self created" achievements like getting a full tier set or a high PvP rank are a great example of one of the things that made vanilla wow great. The lack of guidance from Blizzard and variety of difficult to accomplish feats at 60 directly led to the "wild west" atmosphere of the game that many of us love. 
---
A big part of the draw Classic wow has is the mystery and openness to the world. 15 years of playing the game and you still might come across a quest you've never done or an item you've never seen. A list of achievements that quantifies and enumerates things that you can accomplish in the game detracts from that sense of depth. 
---
You can't open up an achievement screen in Vanilla and see what things to do next to get points. It's not a small QoL change - it alters a fundamental aspect of Classic which is that the game doesn't tell you what to do or where to go. 
---
Buddy the dopamine spike will keep my edging until the release date finally gets here let me tell ya
---
Well this is great to hear! I wanted to roll a lock.....
---
Yea but what dps is gonna apply to a group that is hogging all the orbs? You're only gonna get dps who need the quest/gear in there making your runs harder and take longer. If you do round robin you get less orbs for yourself but more as a group + potentially make some friends in the process.
---
Well this is great to hear! I wanted to roll a lock....
---
Fair enough. However I’m a maxed RS3 player and while I don’t enjoy watching other ‘Scapers grind skills or farm the same bosses over and over, there’s a handful of streamers I enjoy watching just to listen to their commentary 
---
The additions of BGs at launch have not been confirmed. From the way the announcements about phases have been, it SOUNDS like theyll be added at some point after Phase 1, but they didnt confirm anything.
---
For gear, it depends on the meta. Back in Vanilla, if you just PvPd to get your R10 gear, you were probably like the top 20% of the server in terms of gear quality. A lot fo people would ding 60 and jump into BGs or just not have any real plan on endgame raiding and just kind of... play and explore. In pserver meta, ive noticed people will just outright avoid PvPing if their gear is bad. So, early on R10 gear will still be good, but as the server ages it will get worse as peoples gear gets better, to the point where R10 gear will probably be middling in terms of about half the people having better/worse gear than you, but much worse because the people with better gear than you will just keep getting better.
---
Enchanting has an absurd upfront cost which means you have to really work hard to dig your way out of the debt you made for yourself leveling it. Once you're capped though it's a money train but it's a long road out of debt. 
---
Hell hole? I would build a vacation tree fort here. 
---
I could solo raid bosses in legion on my ret...before the last raid of the xpac was even out (during tomb of sargeras i could solo bosses in emerald nightmare)....and it just got easier from there to the end of the xpac :P
---
Dog, I love vanilla and have cleared content through Naxx and plan on doing it again. You won't be singing the tune you are singing when you have been doing MC for two months, have gotten 3 pieces of loot, see MC trash pulls every time you close your eyes, and someone asks if they can bring their hardly geared Ret Paladin.
---
Just fucking wait, buddy. Most likely, though, you won't even make it to 60. 
---
You are right actually because the root it shared with stun diminishing returns, so there really is no point to talent for it. You will reach diminishing returns waaaay faster and if you make your enemy immune more often that's just gonna work against you.
---
Up your battle station game for release my dude. At least get a second monitor. 
---
Disenchanting is profitable if you grind mobs. 
---
enchanting become quite profitable once you get rare enchants which are hard to get and only few ppl have. 
---
first -  tip is much bigger.
---
second  - ppl reach out to you on their own (since this enchants are rare), and you don't really need to advertise much. so you are making free money. though only handful of ppl reach this status.
---
basic bitch enchanting isnt very profitable indeed. and just more of a service.
---
again disenchanting and selling mats, is always making additional gold.
---
Its all gonna depend of how many people are trying to do the same quests, how many people are grinding mobs that you are trying to grind,  how many of the opposing faction are in the area. You might just have to bounce and come back later.
---
Not true, I'm an OT bear in a good pserver guild. There will be plenty of hardcore guilds with feral tanks in vanilla.
---
In the current meta on pservs, PUGS clear MC before world buffs time out...
---
I'm a ret pally also, but I'm not delusional.  I keep 20pts in holy and healing gear in my bag and heal during raids.
---
Bad. Hopefully. My gnome goes straight to Darkshore then Ashenvale. Maximum hipster.
---
Mmmmm...I can’t wait. One of my favorite zones. 
---
I mean it could definitely work for sure.
---
I just think going a warrior would fit you so much better. 
---
That is really interesting.  I end up getting 3/5 in Feral Instinct fairly quickly but perhaps I should prioritize it more.
---
I've always know that Armor in Bear form works on a multiplicative basis, making small amounts of armor worthwhile.  I guess I assumed that Thick Hide also had a multiplicative effect with Bear form.  Like armor x 360% x 110%, where that 10% ended up being more than just 10%.  If it is a flat 10% percent then it is not as good as I thought.
---
I only pvp. I can’t stand having to level every expansion just to start pvp again. Classic will be amazing because I’ll just have to get to 60 once and it’ll never get higher.
---
Probably not. Honestly I don't see it playing out any different than Vanilla and I have fond memories of that.
---
Ashenvale was naturally just a gank ground for Horde. In Vanilla my server was mid-high pop and while TM vs SS was crazy, Ashenvale was around a 1:6 ratio in favour of horde. This was mirrored on every server I tried in Vanilla and TBC.
---
Why? Its geographically shit. The only allied race that naturally ventures there are NE's, compaired to 3 Horde races potentially coming from barrens. Then add the fact that most NE's moved to the Eastern Kingdoms before getting here or some as soon as leaving Teldrassil and it gets worse. THEN add the numerous undead who came over for barrens because SPV isnt amazing and Hillsbrad can be full of high levels and you get a huge Horde swing.
---
Dont get me wrong, most horde I knew still went south to TN, but even with that it was heavily horde populated.
---
Ashenvale for me in Vanilla was a farm at the gates of Astranaar. It's a shame as I love proper pvp battles but I see no reason It'll be different in Classic. :/
---
I'll keep my eyes open for a gnome on a nightsaber.
---
No on any of my servers it wasn't. See my comment. 
---
This, make a forum post where you advertise what rare and wanted recipes you have and people will whisper you
---
i think what he's getting at is that the overall game had a steady difficulty curve and you didn't start from level 1 as an indestructible god with unlimited health and mana, only to suddenly do difficult content on the very highest levels of difficulty. that does not feel consistent or coherent to me, and many players will struggle with high end instanced content where they shouldn't because they've never had to THINK before that or had a moment of ''oh shit i might die'' unless they literally fell off a cliff
---
Depends on how you define PvE. The increased rep is useless for progression and Fear Ward is very valuable. If you’re raiding, dwarfs have the OP racial and it’s not close. The rep bonus is a nice luxury, but I don’t view any luxury as OP. 
---
Same. If vanilla or tbc Blizzard servers still existed I would even re-buy a copy of the game to play. If any other company, besides a gaming one, came and took away a product you paid for people would be furious, pissed.
---
You have me beat. I have been eyeballing the Polk HTS12 but my gf and I have a small studio apartment so I got 2 Bose Companion 2 subs. At low volume they are still incredible.
---
Yup. Sucky as I love some leveling pvp, but this is truth.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
That sounds like a correct answer.
---
So you are basicly telling me don't go undead warlock, go orc warlock? (the way i see it - choose to have an easier time vs priest/lock or anyone able to stun, whereas majority will be rogues?) 
---
lmao what a cuck
---
Even with sharding, unless the shard is underpopulated, the respawn timer is too long. If the respawn timer for some reason is changed, then yeah.
---
It’d be fine. You get to run 2 blessings and 2 auras, have tons of healing and cool downs. Not like 1% speed runner optimal obviously but you’re not going to have any problems.
---
Leveling enchanting while leveling is very costly. Vendoring greens is actually a huge amount of the gold you make while leveling. Meanwhile, you cant really sell anything you make and no one really wants low level enchants (or at least dont want to pay for them). So its basically a money sink to level with little to offset the costs. (while the other profs can at least vendor what they make and also they gather their mats from nodes rather than breaking down expensive gear).
---
At level 60, if you get Enchanting and just break down the cheaper stuff for GEEs and LBS, you can start making a bit of profit off it. So it can be better just to get enchanting at 60, rather than level it at all while leveling. 
---
As for making profit from enchanting (rather than disenchanting), even that can be difficult. A lot of guilds have enchanters so they dont have to pay people for it. So youre kind of stuck trying to find random people that dont have guild enchanters to make profit, which is a somewhat small market. Theres definetely people out there that will buy enchants, but it isnt that profitable and it only really works if you like standing around IF/Org for long periods of time shouting.
---
It can be VERY profitable if youre in a top tier raid guild and you are the guild enchanter that gets some rare enchants and can corner the market. But thats for a very small number of people and I wouldnt gamble on it unless you already know youre going to be in a good raiding guild from the get-go and you have a bit of clout with them in order to get prio on the patterns.
---
Does not mean that there is no challenge, it means that there is no challenge for a very minimal portion of the game...leveling never takes long, even in vanilla it only took like two weeks.
---
I’m all for theorycrafting while on the hype train - but god damn if this shit isn’t asked nearly daily. Use the search option. 
---
fuck your feelings. this is the real world people are gonna joke about shit you dont like and youre just gonna have to walk away and stfu. 
---
feel free to prove yourself right by linking boss records on any current vanilla realm
---
its all priests/paladins topping everything
---
Well, If all you want to do is Pvp. The blue Pvp gear is actually really goods. I used many pieces Until late end game including the gloves and the shoulders. 
---
To improve your gear beyond that you will need to get into raids and grab the leather gear the rogues don’t want or aren’t really meant for them. Getting a good weapon will be difficult though not impossible.
---
I am not up to snuff right now on my specs. My memory doesn’t serve my well and when I try to use the websites on my phone they aren’t working well. 
---
Hope this helped!
---
Your opponent dun got sharpio'd
---
can't believe i have rose-tinted goggles for this game i didn't play until 2011. when am i going to be assigned my mandatory hardcore group
---
Gee.. Getting better gear earlier than anyone else is less effective than an ability that isn't needed? I wasn't aware of that. Remember that Fear Ward has a 3 minute cooldown and only negates 1 fear effect during its 3 minute duration. Whereas a warrior can stance dance and use Berserker Rage to get rid of Fear and provide a 10 second immunity. And Berserker Rage only has a 30 second cooldown.
---
Conclusion: Fear Ward is useful, but not essential. Whereas getting better gear earlier is quite useful for raid progression. Now after everyone gets geared up, that advantage goes away. But it's rather silly to think that better gear isn't valuable.
---
Okay sorry...move along
---
I'll be fighting for every copper when classic releases maybe I'll manage to have 100g this time.
---
That's why the Druid always rezzes the Priest/Shaman/Paladin of the group... duh!!
---
I would actually Feral casually. Yah it will be difficult but if your playing causal it’s all about your level of enjoyment and if that is what you want to do then you should do it. 
---
Now if you can maybe raid one night of the week. Go Resto. You will get into a raid group and you will get gear.
---
paladin might not outdps warrior in vanilla, but in 1v1 they just own wars xD
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyFN01p2xLo&amp;t=1055s
---
I always loved the tenseness this created. You waved and hoped they didnt kill you for it. Then they waved back, but you always kept one eye open on their position. You helped them if they were in trouble to strengthen the understanding and they replyed by thanking you. Then their friend shows up and attacks you breaking the peace. You defend yourself and the og player just joins in to kill you 2v1. Betrayed and dead, you release and spirit ress. You needed to go the class trainer anyway. Good times. 
---
No, they just couldn't rez you if you died.
---
So don't be dumb and pull aggro or stand in the fire if you're a dps
---
Im in the same boat as you, so Im hoping you're right on the money with everything you're saying.
---
I havent touched vanilla in over a decade so I cant wait to get back to the loch, and do some fishing, take the long trek to Scarlet Monastery, and do countless runs of Maraudon,  which was my favorite instance back then.
---
Here's hoping.
---
haha , thank you for that!
---
Love the videos frost, each one seems to have something that the other content creators don't think of.
---
Really love the lore ones too :) 
---
I plan on doing the same 
---
that you also had to spend a consumable on
---
&gt; even in vanilla it only took like two weeks.
---
bruh
---
anyways all i'm saying is that if you spend 1-119 being indestructible, and then you go do world quests and island expeditions and warfronts which you LITERALLY CANT LOSE at 120 and you're STILL indestructible, so you go do normal and heroic dungeons which are steamrolled to hell and back, and then you go do mythic+ or mythic raiding... the difficult part is a very minimal portion of the game. that is bad design, because it is inconsistent with the rest of the game world and yet is considered to be the only part of the game that matters
---
This is a double-edged sword though. Yes BG:s and WPvP were most enjoyable in classic maybe. But arenas were even more enjoyable for a lot of people and most of them would rate any other expansion better in terms of PvP.
---
Almost as bad as people questing in wetlands
---
*sound of stealth*
---
I'm referring to the guy who 1 shot uldir bosses while it was current.
---
He basically did an advanced reckoning by abusing some mobs that buffed him. 
---
&gt; I hate to say this but I’m a little biased against Druid healers because of this unless there’s another hybrid in the group.
---
Name checks out
---
Which really sucks.  My guild felt like a surrogate family.  Like if we failed, we learned from it and try again, but we all did our best so no one was to blame.
---
high skill cap, but if you're good, you can take almost anyone 1v1. 
---
since most of your levelling fights will be random skirmishes or 1v1s, druid versatility, self heals, shift form bonuses, plus invis, means you're laughin in wpvp
---
Retail is that way  =====&gt;   /r/wow
---
Agreed.  I was sad to hear that there wouldnt even be a toggle for the new models, because dwarf beards are stellar in retail.
---
Crossing that bridge going west from the Barrens still gives me the willies to this day
---
This 100%. My wife just got into vanilla via private servers so I bought her a PC and desk to put next to mine.  She's a noob but at least she doesn't care about me taking a week off work for wow.
---
Yah, let me go back 12 years ago and find a computer I haven’t owned for 10 years so I can prove some weep wrong. 
---
You do not speak from experience and you do not take into account varying groups and fights it is not hard nor impossible for a good dare I say great Druid to be top heals.
---
Please don't. The difference between races are extremely small and these threads just turn into the most pointless arguments. If you really want to know just go and google it because thousands of words have already been written on it.
---
I wasn’t implying that classic was too hard but people don’t need to be uppity assholes about who struggles with what in it. I quit retail for being too easy. I was poking at the serious response to a meme.
---
Sorry I was talking about both. We only let boomkin in as a joke and they player playing boomkin new he was joking. 
---
I agree with your point that what is offensive is generally well known and I don't think I stated otherwise. Here I state what is more important and why we shouldn't try to regulate offensive speech.
---
&gt; **3.) Offensive the word, has too much legitimacy**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Let us replace the word offensive, with an appropriate synonym, irritates. Now let us say instead of having the option to report someone for being offensive, you can report someone because they irritate you. See how stupid that sounds? But, because the word “offensive” has become so legitimized, we don’t even think of the rationality of muting others because they offend us.  
---
&gt;Offense is first of all a subjective experience. What is offensive to one person is not necessarily offensive to another. That applies to the synonyms, like irritates, as well.  
---
&gt;To be offended, just like being irritated, is not necessarily a bad thing.  
---
&gt;**a.) When you are in the right.** If, for example, you were a doctor and saw a hospital badly run, one would be offended, but that offense would prompt you to action, to revitalize the hospital. In WoW, one can be assaulted verbally by another party member, but instead of muting that person, let us say that the old classic standard applies and you have to read what he says. Another person can also take offense at the way you are handled and stand up for you, which can unexpectedly gain you a lifelong friend. One can convince the person that is being rude that he is wrong, therefore adding more cohesion to the group and learning a skill of mediation, which would not have happened if he was muted. **At the end of the day, isn’t the social interaction one of the main things we missed from classic?**  
---
&gt;**b.) When you are in the wrong.** Not many people think about this, but you can be offended and be wrong. A typical example would be if you are any kind of addict and if a person implores you to stop, you would be typically offended.  
---
&gt;Furthermore, comedy is almost by definition an offensive experience. Something is always the butt of a joke and it is no wonder then, that it is comedians that are the first casualties in the “offensive wave”.  
---
&gt;Remember, I am for neutrality in this situation. I do not want Blizzard too take any sides in this, but to my offended friends, I can easily flip the situation back onto you. If you are allowed to say that this and that is offensive, why am I not allowed the same right? I can also draw up a list of things that I find offensive and we can end up, fairly applying that principle, have everyone continually muted. Is that what we really want though?
---
My friend thought he was clever. He would play a Troll rogue that would hide around the little bridges on the way to Menethil Harbor.
---
The title is about Classic WoW though and arenas were in until TBC. If the title of the post was about "overall best pvp experience" then there would be room for debate. I personally did not like arenas as it made it so only certain specs or class combos were able to compete.
---
That was a stupid amount of gold in classic at that level. 
---
To be fair a lot of the people on this sub could probably use sunshine and exercise, myself included.
---
Yeah, all that down time means plenty of time to talk to chat. I’m a big fan of Mr LLamma for example who spends hours on Diablo 2 just grinding for uniques and bullshitting with his chat
---
What gear are you talking about? And the idea that any gear on your priest is more impactful to the raid than Fear Ward is a bit silly. But most importantly, being a human doesn’t give you exclusive access to anything, it just speeds up rep process. Once you have your rep, you’re still just a bad version of a dwarf priest. Min-max players don’t consider time saved in min-maxing, they consider the ultimate result.
---
The best gear for PVP drops in raids.
---
If you choose a non gear dependent class, farm the PVP gear set it will be OK until Blizz release AQ / Naxx (the last 2 raids).
---
I think you would have at least a year in front of you before it happens.
---
You're right, I misunderstood. I remember from my vanilla experience in 2005 that there was only 1 Rank 14 person on a server each week. Is that not the case?
---
Unlike the bs "lore" in retail, Ashenvale will never fall to the Horde!
---
The thing about classic PVP is that there is no PVP stat like resilience therefore some of the same items that are the best in PVE content are the best in PVP as well. There is PVP gear as a reward for gaining PVP ranks but depending on what itemization blizz implements they might be pretty bad until much later on, and even then there are so many pieces that you will want coming from PVE content. The epic pvp sets also require a high rank to get which means you have to get a very high amount of honor several weeks in a row which is very demanding of your time so if you only want to play 6 hours a week that gear is going to be out of your reach. Ive known plenty of players on pservers who never stepped foot in a raid who were very good at pvp but even they had to do some dungeons because otherwise you are doing BGs in questing greens and you will get stomped by lesser players because they have 40% more stats than you do. Though, depending on your class your need for gear could be not as drastic. Casters can get by much easier than melee without any gear but melee NEED strong weapons to compete and the best weapons are very difficult to acquire. The only PVP reward weapons are locked behind Rank 14 which requires you to play 8 hours a day in premades 5 capping AB over and over again for 3 weeks straight and thats only after you have gotten to rank 13. So while it is entirely possible to only pvp in vanilla its not entirely advisable. But vanilla raiding is also very different than raiding in any other expansion. It might be boring but you should give it a try you might like it.
---
As a warrior you really really want to take engineering as one of your profession.
---
Fuck that. Just vendor greater magic wands and you'll have your first mount good saved up by level 30
---
I'm really sure it was on mine at release. 
---
I even have it on screenshot https://i.imgur.com/KeXQzGW.jpg, raids and counter raids in Ashenvale were almost a daily thing for the first few weeks after release. Plenty of wpvp anytime you ventured outside of towns
---
Oh nice, haven’t heard of him but that sounds pretty decent 
---
Yeah what I mainly meant was that vanilla wasn't and isn't the most competitive pvp game, so if you are only focusing on pvp there might be better games out there.
---
No shitting on classic wow pvp on my part though, it is still fairly enjoyable.
---
Yup on my server it was either x-road or Tarren-Mill.
---
after level 40 you start to get decent amounts from quests and mobs so around 58 this wouldn't be so great
---
The quest gives you gold as a reward. Some quests give money too.
---
1g is nothing at 60 and this quest is for scholomance
---
This is a lvl 58 dungeon quest, 1.8g is practically nothing at max level when you look at how expensive everything is.
---
Ad hominem fallacy: (of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining. Your comment was douchey and negative...and he called you a tool for that. He did not state your point was invalid because you are a tool...you are just a tool. 
---
So I know you didn't ask but if you are LF a guild, we would be interested in 2 palas that are going holy at 60. 
---
We are building a guild for ppl that have jobs/ a life/ some kids but still want to progress through the awesome PvE-content that we know will come. No hardcore demand, we will have 2 raids, tues + thurs 20-23 CET.
---
If you are interested, PM me or join our Discord -   [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) Guild name Glamorama
---
No there's no real limit to how many can hit rank 14 at the same week, the limit is only well how big bracket 1 is. But I bet back in vanilla it wasn't common for people to hit r14 at the same week as it wasn't stacked as well as it's been on private servers.
---
He's no opponent, just a guy who had a bit of faulty memory. 
---
Nobody is going to believe you didn't train summoning. Just look like a dick
---
Hell yeah dude! Those things are dope! I've got the companion fives as well, and I was super impressed with the quality. Very non resonant and clear bass, perfect for an apartment. Congrats on the purchase man, you will love them! 
---
Yeah no, this is exactly what I mean when I talk about toxic people who pretend like they don't know what's offensive or not.
---
There's tasteful comedy, and there's offensive rhetoric. This is the nuance I described above. Any reasonable adult can tell the difference between the two.
---
This is something that's decided upon by culture, not you. You don't get to say "Well, the N word isn't offensive to me, but the word mute is. So, I get to say the N word all I want, and you can't mute me because that's offensive to me!" That's the kind of argument a preteen makes.
---
If you can't discern between what's offensive or not, then you're not fit to interact with other people. Stay off the internet until you can figure it out.
---
So if an entire pre-made of 15 people spend all week 5 capping AB, they could all get rank 14 in the same week?
---
The Hinterlands and crater are my favorite zones. not sure how good i can farm with a shadow priest.
---
Reliable Gold farming methods? Also you don't have any Numbers on how much g/h druid will make soloing Diremaul Tribute? 
---
I agree, I just want to get immersed in a real mmo again.
---
As a pure pvp game vanilla isn't really that good imo. It takes a long time to level and get gear and consumes just for pvp. The pvp itself is pretty good but imo the work for it as a pure pvp fan is meh 
---
PvP Realm - PvP is always enabled (flagged for PvP) as long as you're above level 10 I believe. Your first character on this realm  locks you to that faction unless you delete it and reroll (can't have ally+horde).
---
PvE (Normal) - Can roll both factions simultaneously, PvP flag default off, unless manually forced on. PvP gets enabled only in places like Gurubashi.
---
RP-PvP, if implemented - acts like a PvP realm.
---
That means 4 Eva but longer
---
This is how I played as well
---
I don't think servers will have 15 bracket 1 spots, but yes if it was big enough and say they all started from week 1 of pvp release and got bracket 1 together, then week 12 they would all hit r14 at the same time.
---
I'd imagine the popular levelling addons will have little warnings for quests that become pointless once &gt;2 people are trying to do it if quest items/respawns remain vanilla-like. If they don't change them optimal levelling for most people will be a lot of grinding. Whether Blizzard is happy with that or not I don't know.
---
Yeah, now. I said vanilla. 
---
I think the thing that is incredible for me is how you could say vanilla WOW catered to the hard core crowd, but when I played it as a CASUAL player I enjoyed it more than I enjoy playing BFA casually now. 
---
Leveling to 60 was a huge achievement. So was being able to work on professions, dabble in PVP, etc. Every small upgrade I got felt awesome. As if I was investing into something bigger. 
---
Now I play BFA and the loot piñata that is that game makes everything feel pointless. Sadly it seems like the d3 devs got to WoW at some point. 
---
Sad thing is alot of these quests unlock important question chains
---
I want a MAWA hat now. They could do horde and alliance ones
---
Just sucks to have to constantly run back and slows down dungeons. Feel free to disagree I’ll have a pocket healer anyways so I’m not to worried about my oppinion being considered shitty. 
---
Can druids contribute to organized PvP outside of flag carrying and camping AB flags? 
---
I’ll be grinding in southern barrens to at least lvl 24 before I hit ashenvale. 
---
Shit I forgot about being scared of UD rogues
---
Pvp is only enabled in flagged zones, buffing/healing a pvp enabled character or typing /pvp. Starting zones are safe and some other zones are not flagged.
---
Reading this gets me excited
---
Yes it’s very viable, however it will not feel this same as WOTLK. But you can still play mildly offensive in BGs and give PI to casters (who will love you for it) 
---
The big thing is disc takes more gear before it gets good. 
---
You are flagged for pvp on a pvp realm when you enter a contested zone, so basically all zones after lvl 20 (redridge and ashenvale and up).
---
Classic is the best version of WoW if you want to do a lot of open world pvp.
---
You're not a puss if you don't go PvP. A lot of people just prefer dueling or structured PvP with battlegrounds. I've played PvP almost exclusively because I love the added sense of danger and the way it makes the world feel more alive. But you play the way you want to, man. The other realm types exist for a reason. I've had great experiences on both RP and RP PvP realms as well.
---
I highly recommend rolling on a PvP server.  You're missing out on a big part of the game by playing it safe on a PvE server.
---
You'll level slower than you would on PvE, but being ganked, ganking, raiding towns, and the crazy low level world PvP that will be happening the first few weeks will create some great memories.
---
It's very rare for alliance to bother with those quests. 
---
heads up, you posted a playlist
---
Here come Ion...
---
Who?
---
Ion!
---
This guy gets it
---
Well yeah I don't want to get in trouble for the whole mix/max thing haha but Orc Lock is overweight in the "hardcore pvp" respondents. (This is by looking at who said they'd do BGs, Engineering, and level quickly to 60)
---
yes it is, your spec is pretty bad.
---
I have never duo leveled paladins, though I do see a lot of synergy. I have an idea for two specs that might fit what you two are looking to accomplish, a tank and deep retribution combo. The tank would rely on reflective damage while the deep ret would swing a 2 hander, while waiting for vengeance+consecrate procs. It's easier to have the ret heal when the tank gets low, but there is the option for the tank to go into holy and pick up consecrate+knockback resist to heal themselves. Message me if you want calculator links! 
---
Thanks for your big answer !
---
Borderlands 3 comes out in the fall. So we can look forward to that :)
---
Staysafe says people stack the brackets by earning the same amount of honor so more people get the same bracket.
---
Are you retarded, I'm still talking about vanilla. 1.8g is nothing at lvl 60 when your epic mount cost 1000g, repairs are a gold a death, and all of your pre-raid bis can range between 400-2000g depending on class.
---
Start of Q3
---
I've seen so many pally drops as a horde player it seems like a no brainer to roll a horde pally. I'll be rolling in gear! Just surprised no one else has thought of it.
---
Damn! I knew I had forgotten something :)
---
In standard French you'd say Sha-man in a monotone and under accentuated way, as if adding together the words "chat" + "manne"
---
I agree, the private server tryhards are awful and the no changes movement is a toxic movement. We could've had guild banks and a graphic overhaul along with updated models and animations and much more if werent for them. Wish there was a transmog system added into the game , same with achievements. 
---
so this guys speaks the truth but gets downvoted...

I’ve always said it like sham-in, because shawmen and shayyyyymen aren’t cool enough 
---
Bad Joke 0/10  
---
\- IGN
---
Incorrect. 1.8g is still a noteworthy sum even at 60.
---
Try raiding 2days 3hours each without farming a metric shit tons of consumes. Boomkin damage is z-e-r-o without lvl45 mana pots and demonic runes on cooldown after running out of mana 40seconds into a 15minute fight. 
---
Is it faster leveling to grind a single area or complete the quests?
---
Copy pasta
---
nah we're good, what we really need rn is classic
---
lol
---
This is not terrible bait, but
---
&gt;I am going to create a guild where there is no master loot or loot council but a more friendly and fair system, the regular greed need pass system! I will also allow all race / class spec combinations and no consumes are required. Let's show these snobby tryhards that it's possible to down KT and still only raid 2 days a week for 3 hours each!
---
is a bit too on the nose.
---
You needed to save up 1000g for your epic mount. However, you *also* needed to pay for gear that you got at various rep levels which could easily be 100g, if you were an enchanter you needed an arcanite rod (100g), if you were a tailor your epic robe cost a bundle, and so on.
---
Felcloth and moon cloth seem to be good avenues.
---
Why do you care what "they" think? We all enjoy this game for different reasons. Focus on your own joy and fulfillment.
---
I like to go full try-hard on server releases, play 20 hours a day and min/max every aspect of the game I can. I get called a NEET, autist, try-hard scum, and told that I'm on welfare- despite working 50+ hours a week and using vacation time for releases. At the end of the day, I'm still going to do what I find to be the most fun, despite what others say or think.
---
I swear, Frost's video are the best thing for Vanilla, no bullshit, atmospheric, cozy and informative. Subbed since 12k, love his vids. 
---
I was gold cap in Vanilla, I never once farmed mobs for gold.
---
If it weren't for the "awful private server tryhards" you wouldn't even have classic wow in the first place.
---
Duskwood! Prepare to be ganked here alot as a lvl 20-30 alliance. 
---
Close proximity to STVietnam, lvl 30+ hordies who have had their first taste for alliance blood will travel on the road between STV and Darkshire for more servings of alliance blood. 
---
I would only recommend enchanting if you are going to be in the officer core of a raiding guild, so that you have a somewhat reasonable chance of snagging an early recipe. Else, you might have to work a bit harder at end game to make money. Especially since you have to run dungeons yourself to farm gold, or have a complex trade skill shuffle working with multiple characters. It can be very useful early, if you are a wand user, but you lose vendor gold from old gear and quest rewards.
---
It's a gamble.
---
Go with human then, you'll get into a guild as a holy priest anyways
---
Who doesnt love Ungoro!? There are freakin dinosaurs man!
---
2 things,
---
First people who tell you you won't be able to raid as a boomkin (at least for the first two tiers) are not min maxers, the boomkin dps isn't just a bit worst, it's atrocious, you'll be doing half the dps than the bottom dps and you will have to farm a fuck ton consumable just to be able to keep up with the mana you need to dps even on easy bosses. 
---
Second thing is, you have to remember that in a guild, there's other people, not just you. It might be fun for you to play as a boomkin (spoilers it's not, you literally just have 1 button to press) but it's not gonna be fun for the others when the boss doesn't die fast enough and they see that you are pretty much useless.
---
Stop being stubborn and play mage or warlock if you want to play caster in raids.
---
like what a lvl 4 then a lvl 5 quest? what starting zone quest leads to anything that important?
---
That is quite a good way of looking at it. I was in the mindset of 1 holy, 1 ret but I suppose for leveling their is no need to be full holy.
---
I can vendor a gray item worth that much, and there are farming spots that make well over 40g+ an hour. You can't just say I'm wrong without saying why. I'm literally telling you why 1.8g isn't worth anything.
---
to be fair. 2 gold for 1 quest in vanilla is huge
---
There's only a limited amount of players allowed in each bracket, that is 0.3% of the people who get 15hk.
---
The reason people stack brackets, is because the guy with highest honor in each bracket gets the maximum amount of points, so if everyone in the bracket is highest honor, then everyone gets maximum points
---
Not really, a mount cost 1000g
---
I don't think there is for dragonkin other than the hunter survival talent. It would be a bit overpowered I suppose as a lot of raid bosses are dragons. 
---
Enjoy getting rekt by shitty cleric substitutes in pvp, then 
---
Don’t feed the troll
---
I never tried to make it a thing, but it just so happened I spent most of my time leveling as a paladin duo/trio in early vanilla.
---
Strong defensive combo obviously, steady grinding but not the fastest. Wpvp wise it's too defensive for its own good, few are willing to engage and almost anyone can escape which was frustrasting.
---
Really cool class fantasy, the Verigan questchain is going to be a blast
---
I just saw a comment last night saying they had a bunch of "meme specs" in the raid and did not use consumes and managed to down KT, thats what i plan on doing, sure we wont clear it for a couple weeks but we will eventually!
---
I'd agree TBC onward was more competitive for the arenas and ranking system because it brought certain class/spec combos to the spotlight.  It all depends on the flavor of PvP you're after. 
---
Typically after picking a fight and losing lol
---
That's hilarious.  I quit bfa after we had normal uldir down, but just before we had heroic down.
---
If you want to, sounds like you got a game plan, tanking paladin + any heals can work out pretty good for leveling, even better in dungeons if you play well together and communicate. 
---
1 oz of gold is like $1200, your rich my man
---
You must have sucked at making money. Even in an absolutely shit spot farming beasts you can make 40+ gold/hour if you have skinning, just from vendoring leather.
---
In particular: 
---
Webwood Venom / Webwood Egg --- opens up Tenaron's Summons, which starts the Crown of the Earth chain.
---
These require level 3/4, and Crown of the Earth is 100% exploration (go here, come back)
---
If you happen to start crown of the earth at 4, you can get 4,195xp (83% of a level), without killing a single mob, just by going to 4 spots on the map. (65 mob kills worth of xp)
---
So one bottleneck quest opens up an entire level's worth of essentially free XP.
---
Then again the invunerability potion is sick vs rogues, and there's really no equivelant vs. spellcasters (the spell reflect trinkets aren't really the same). So stay undead? 
---
Pretty funny but you could make it a bit more subtle
---
The paladin has very high sustain that scales into the late game.  The ret can easily heal by using lower ranks of heals and putting blessing of light on the tank. By having a reflective tank, it makes the group adaptive enough to dip into a dungeon group or AoE grind mobs+quest.
---
But there's probably a really fun shockadin build out there if you want to be more holy+ret
---
Tanaris pirate area for sure
---
Yep and many others especially at later levels also
---
tomorrow
---
I love that, taking out a loan. I wonder if there was ever some sort of underground WoW bank 
---
no day yet, we only know that its coming out summer of this year

noon gmt+1
---
Didn’t you read OPs wall of text? These people are literally criminals. Where is your moral compass man?
---
I live in Hawaii, went surfing yesterday.  Was lots of fun.  Still find myself checking every day for a release date.  The waves really are dead in July anyway...
---
Yes, you are correct. 
---
I don't think anything in holy will help enough while leveling to justify it beyond just wanting to be holy.
---
That sounds terrible but also that’s why I loved original WoW and that’s what I miss. Sometimes you spend a whole week doing boring crap because you need to put in the hours for something good. Now you get a mount for cheap, it’s just not the same. I remember being super jealous of people having mounts and I remember people being super excited when they go their first. 
---
Dude no Penance in Vanilla. Disc is dead without it! 
---
lol. try healing ele shaman burst, your plate will not help you.
---
In my defence. I was super new to computers. My family was poor so I didn't have one while growing up. But one day I powered up my 32k modem, and asked trade chat if there was something I could do to help with my lag issues. 20minutes later, I was in a panic after deleting my win32.exe file.
---
Summer 
---
Honestly, this post is pretty ignorant. If you want to play some less popular class spec combination, that's fine, I doubt anyone will stop you. But getting mad over potentially not being included in a more hardcore guild, when you clearly are not ready to contribute as much, is stupid. Just join a more casual guild, there will be plenty, dont worry. 
---
That's sad if all you have in life is this game...
---
No I’m not “retarded”, though people who use that word as an insult are pieces of shit so at least we know you’re one of those...
---
I’m not saying epic mounts didn’t cost a lot, nor am I saying that for raiders this wasn’t a lot, but for the vast majority of players in vanilla, nearly 2 gold just for a quest would have been a God send. 
---
Wait wait wait, you can SS a dead person in Retail and it rezzes them? wtf.
---
This, small anecdote, i connected on a private servers i didn't play for 2 years, i'm a druid full t2 in orgrimmar with no guild, it took less than 5 minutes before a big guild tried to recruit me. You don't even need to inspect, the gear in vanilla is so iconic, you can see someone's achievements by just looking at him.
---
Ahhhhh fuck the crab cages. I spent so many hours there to get my first skeletal horse for my mage 
---
What are your goals? Endgame PvE or PvP primarily? How much do you value a fun experience while leveling?
---
Which is good in theory imo. 
---
That's true, but back in the day I was in a guild that had a set rate dkp system, with rolls instead of bidding for contested items between people that had the requisite dkp. If you didn't have enough dkp, or negative dkp, you could still get the item if nobody else needed it, you would just subtract it from your total and go "more" negative. This resulted in me, as a druid, never being able to upgrade my neck, back, or trinket/ring slots because I would be roughly -10,000 dkp because I would absorb unwanted gear for offspecs but still "spend" the dkp on those items. I feel that type of system fucks over druids hard.
---
Standing in fire?
---
You can buy remastered now and play classic Warcraft 3 before launch. That's what me and my roommate are planning on doing anyway.
---
Paladins look like THE most boring PvE class in all of Classic. Super dope and high skill cap in PvP though. 
---
You should just roll a warrior or rogue again. 
---
Isn't the shaman the best raid healer?
---
Yea they changed it in mop I think? Works just like a battle Rez. Part of the class homogenization changes. They also made death knight raise ally into a proper combat rez.
---
Probably friends with one of the 5 warriors saying they're going to be a Healer 😂
---
This is not the BM I remember pre-TBC lol maybe 1.12 with TBW made it possible? But Spirit Bond is solo'ing who? 
---
To be clear, an ad hominem would be "You're wrong because you're a tool."  He's not saying you're wrong, he's just calling you a tool.
---
alliance warlock and restoration shaman. never can have enough shamans in a guild.
---
World PvP was amazing in my opinion. Because there was no cross realm battle grounds you knew who were the big gankers, who was geared and who wasn't. This allowed for amazing rivalries that to this day I remember. I remember this giant ass Tauren Warrior with the original Destroyer of Worlds ZG sword named Cheesecake and every time our paths crossed it was amazing PvP for the next hour. If guildmates were on (from bothsides) it was PvP for the next 2hrs.  
---
I plan on PvE for gear and then I’ll move to PvP when I have a comfortable build. I plan on digging in to PvE off the bat. Leveling experience I don’t have much of a preference on. I leveled warrior during vanilla so nothing could be worse than that I think haha
---
I default Shah-Min because of the word Shamanic. Shay-May-Nick sounds silly. Sha-Monn-Nick.
---
If I’m trolling/super high, I’ll say Shay-Min.
---
I’m not your guys for gold farming. I was always broke and when I did farm I farmed ruin cloth.
---
&gt; Please, I raided BC in Arms spec
---
Stopped reading there. They're totally different worlds.
---
The whole guide will be supplied about a week before launch. Early access is a month before
---
Is it a one button class? I plan on diving into PvP once I get gear from PvE. This goes for shaman and paladin. Does shaman have a high skill cap as well?
---
Cool story. 
---
1.8 G is nothing at 60 considering your mount costs 1000g. Have you even played vanilla?
---
You most definitely get to do that stuff if you're the off-tank. You only stay in Bear for the duration of the encounter if you're tanking something for the duration of the encounter - which generally doesn't happen unless you're the main tank or you're fighting Patchwerk.
---
4 Shahbois.
---
It's all perspective!
---
It was about classic wow. Just a reference to private server. 
---
Not at level 60. 2g is like the cost of a repair after a raid. 
---
Struggling here.  
---
Played Shaman as my main, mage,  and war to 60.
---
Always wanted a rogue, but never could level him for some reason. 
---
Thought hunter this time around,  but priest is pretty sweet too.
---
No, being elmo in hell
---
Flash of Light, Holy Light; that’s it.
---
Totem micro is very brain-intensive and requires lots of micro management. It’s extremely high skill cap that requires a unique skill set.
---
Yeah I thought that was reasonable but interesting myself. I get going LW since you can just vendor the leather for extra silver, but Herbalism (for example) would seem far less profitable that way. Plus it looks like only 40sh% of the people who say they're going herbalism while leveling are also going Alchemy. So 60% of people herbing are either storing it up in their bank or trying to sell it while the economy is still developing.
---
Seems like you might be right and mats might be cheap and could be a good time to level a crafting profession! 
---
I'd be getting gold through Skinning and Mining, and I'm planning on levelling through grinding, earning lots of gold.
---
What ever you do don't level prot....both go ret, maybe one respect for reckoning when available
---
Mana regen formulas in Vanilla:
---
* Priests and mages: 13 + (spirit / 4) mana per [tick](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Tick)
---
* Druids, shamans, paladins, hunters: 15 + (spirit / 5) mana per [tick](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Tick)
---
* Warlocks: 8 + (spirit / 4) mana per [tick](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Tick)
---
Priests get quite a bit more from Innervate than a Druid ever will. After Priests, Druids are the next best choice because they actually wear gear with spirit on it, while Mages, Shaman, Paladins, and Hunters don't.
---
Haha I think I can manage totems fine
---
And some wellbutrin. Shiiiiet
---
Absolutely! You just have to be skilled at your feral tactics. Switching between cat, bear and heals is huge.

In the same vein, what is the most sought after for each role? (Tank Healer DPS)
---
You think you do, but you don't 
---
As a rouge in warsong you can when you carry the flag vanish and instantly spam click. That will drop any cc from you (you also drop the flag) but since you I stably Spam clicked you would have it back. Hard to explain but actually pretty easy to pull of. Works most of the time.
---
You're very welcome!
---
All of them have great flavor and lore in vanilla if I remember correctly.
---
Nice 
---
transmog. if this is not a troll, then you should be ashamed of yourself.
---
We can agree to disagree. Does shaman have farming potential?
---
Tank or healer.
---
Each healer has their own play style. I suggest playing them all to see which you like better. Druids can tank also... 
---
Yeah but the key to get into scholo is what.. 15g at least?
---
Similar story here, except in my case it was the black dragonscale leggings pattern. Sold them for 200-225g a pop all the time and mats cost under 100g, or if you brought me mats I'd make it for a 50g crafting fee. Made literally thousands of gold that way.
---
Yeah. Reserve that until you try it for yourself. Perfect totems is almost nonexistent.
---
Shamoon
---
Probably Shawarma 
---
Yup lol. Who would have thought getting something after working hard for it feels more satisfying than being handed everything you want.
---
Not as efficient, but I don't remember anyone not joining my groups because of it, even if we didn't have another person to rez. And as far as raiding, you get to soak up gear pretty easy since most guilds don't take as many druids.
---
The problem with that, is that MMOs are an entirely different beast. You can be a successful RPG by just selling a few hundred thousand copies on the first day.
---
MMOs are completely different. You have to keep those people playing for years and years across many different server.
---
&gt;It just so happens that in 2019, 2004's Classic WoW is the closest thing we have to match this style of game. And the amount of groveling and petitioning it took just to get it made was astounding.
---
There's always Everquest, which also has Classic servers.
---
Life is kinda shitty sometimes hombre.
---
It's nice to be excited for things,  you should try it
---
Any chance you've got a link to that wallpaper? &lt;3

There are a lot worse things people can call each other than retard and I like how your put it in quotations to act as if I said a racial slur of the sort. But your defending a point that makes no sense. Especially since I can literally vendor a gray item at 60 that is worth between 1.5-5g. 2 gold from a quest that you have to find a group for and complete a dungeon is a lot of wasted time investment if your doing it for the money. 
---
This is so funny because it's true.
---
Let's not forget:
---
"You're of the opposite faction and I know you could obliterate me but I want to show that I'm just having a good time and harmless and please please please don't kill me" = Jump a lot in sporadic directions
---
I agree it's little but the logic is faulty.
---
That's like saying paying to eat dinner at a restaurant every day is not much because a private jet costs a million bucks.
---
Perspective.
---
"Check out this sick tree fort! Great view, never gets cold.....wtf is that? Oh fuck raptors can climb trees?!"
---
You're right that it should scale multiplicatively. It is a decent talent but in the grand scheme of things and especially while leveling it is not worth taking over Feral Instinct IMO. However you are the best judge of this. If you never lose aggro on a pull then you also don't need more points in there.
---
This is me. Classic in my veinssssss
---
Shaman for me
---
Doesn’t change that you’re a piece of shit for using it. Show me one gray item that vendored for at least a gold in classic, you can’t because there were none. The prices were inflated over the years so indeed there are grays now that vendor for that much but in vanilla no way. 
---
You’re not talking to someone who knows nothing about vanilla, I actually played it, I know what I’m talking about. 
---
Yeah that dungeon reserving thing is not my style either. I avoid groups who reserve stuff even if I don't want the thing myself. Just something about reserving loot turns me off.
---
Its tough to make money on it before you get the end game recipes, then it prints money. But youll need to be in a guild thats going to funnel enchant recipes that drop in high end content to you. Personally I don't take it. I make a bank alt and give that alt enchanting since in vanilla a level 1 enchanter with 1 enchanting skill can disenchant any greens you send them. The high 55+ level mats sell on the AH pretty damn well, so if I ever get green BoEs, I mail them to the alt, disenchant and use the mats for my own enchants or sell on the AH, freeing up a profession on my main.
---
I prefer the saying: "build a man a fire, he'll be warm for the night. But set a man on gire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life!"
---
Yup. But nothing compared to some other quetsts:
---
 [https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=7462](https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=7462)
---
If you pick the two handed mace which vendor for 7g 12s and 36 copper this one quest give you a grand total of 9 gold, 82 silver and 36 copper.
---
Now THAT is a lot.
---
Female troll rogues, I guess we can wrap it up
---
It wont kill when your wearing a shit ton of stamina. What do you think people do in pvp? Only glass cannon?
---
This is NOT relevant to classic. Just stop please.
---
Even so, are you telling me that you only see folks by their *CLASS?* You xenophobic, homophobic, claustrophobic, hydrophobic, arachnophobic jerk!
---
We shall henceforth not refer to each other as anything other than, "Friend." That way we all feel safe.
---
I don't know why you got down voted because I find it a good stab at the ludicrousness going on in society right now. Best to argue about things that don't matter so that we can stay distracted from the big stuff! ;)
---
Well obviously not recently. Any two-handed weapon will EASILY vendor 3g+ in the 50-60 lvl bracket. And grey items that are plate or mail will be around 1-2g. I not talking about just any old meat or bone drop from beasts. That obviously doesn't vendor for shit.
---
Paladin is arguably the most boring, simple class in the game. Shaman is much more complex and has probably the highest skill cap out of all healers in pvp. Go shaman.
---
Heh, I actually deliberately avoided doing the res quest until level 69 on w.a.r.m.a.n.e. Realized after doing the first part of the chain that the quest XP was scaled to your level. Granted me 2/3 of a level at 69 for some easy xp.
---
Some people mentioned enchanters within guilds - what was the general opinion of people with professions servicing other guildies? Was it common to provide services to other guildies at cost (only the cost of materials), or maybe with a small tip? I can’t remember what the common etiquette was. 
---
Also its completely flat and open, the only thing to hide you is draw distance/stealth.
---
Take the stickers off your case. They’re disgusting. 
---
July 16th
---
i dont have anything, this game is just hope its not even a guarantee.
---
Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
---
I should add I never played private servers, so my experience is limited to old vanilla.
---
No different than druid mage rogue warlock priest then.
---
100 days 😢
---
funny i just did this quest on a p server and was thinking the same.
---
You do realize the reason to bring an Arms warrior to a raid, Blood Frenzy, is not an ability in Vanilla right?
---
Classic PvP is a million times better than BFA. That's for sure.
---
I wouldnt say objectively worse. They fill their own niche. Healing touch can be very mana efficient. On the other hand Druids can produce incredible throughput through Regrowth spam with 5 piece T2, higher than any other healer in the game except a priest chaincasting Prayer of Healing.
---
I find them very fun to play.
---
Shaman. Healing spec is shit in PvP and paladins is the best.
---
As I said, I’m not talking about raiders, raiders made up a sliver of the vanilla player base. 
---
It's entirely personal taste which one is "better". Don't feel pressured by people.
---
The best if you decide for yourself. Roll on a PvP private server (the popular ones are PvP). Play until you reach a contested zone.
---
Shawman would sound the same as shoreman. Whereas shahman would sound more like sharman. 
---
How do you hear them the same?
---
https://games.mxdwn.com/news/the-latest-on-world-of-warcraft-classic-development/
---
Yes please 
---
You can work around that. Either tank the dungeon yourself, or get a hybrid dps like shadowpriest, ele/enhance shaman or a ret paladin/prot paladin.
---
Resto Shaman is always in very high demand
---
Why would Americans say shoreman?
---
Paladins are usually hard to find in my experience. You’ll always have a good time getting invited for stuff if you play one. 
---
Once again, I’m not talking about how much the items vendor for now. I’m done trying to explain this to someone so dense. 
---
&gt;One day after school I followed a classmate home.
---
This made me laugh for some reason.
---
What is this magical job you have acquired?
---
Fuck you, Reid.
---
They are good healers, but lets face it. Not having a res is a huge disadvantage. There's no way around that.
---
Sometimes dumb shit happens and people die. Happens even in the best of groups, and not having a res when you die deep inside BRD suck ass.
---
Yes, I got my start playing in 2005 at age 14
---
Trying to pitch in enough copper between my wife and I to pay our repair bills... I need this money man.
---
My trolling recoiled and landed me a 48 hours ban.
---
Sometimes when I was bored, I would log on and play my rogue alt. A character that was made for the sole purpose of dicking around. I went to Azshara to find/report/troll some chineese gold farmers (aka. 90% of  Azshara's population). When i found an alliance bot, If I did not kill it, i would kite it. Either kite it close to a horde bot, hoping they would start killing each other (they often ended up doing exactly that) or kite them far and deep out in the ocean. As an undead, they would drown before I did.
---
The first option was my favourite. If the bot is getting killed too many times, the "bot handler" will take controll over the character. Seeing that their bot was killed and there are bot(s) of the oposite faction near their corpse, they would usually retaliate. One time, the retaliations for ganking ended up in a "Chinese civil war", several bots huting each other down. Staying in stealth at a safe distance, I was quite pleased with the mayhem I had created.
---
After a while, a GM would contact me: "Thank you for reporting this... blahblahblah". But then one day, as I spoke to a GM, he told me that my Guild name was in violation of Blizzard's naming policy. So he handed me a 48 hour ban on the spot.
---
My friend, who was with me at the time also got banned the same day for using a bot in AV. He was banned for 3 hours.... The World (of Warcraft) is not always fair
---
The lack of res aside, I prefer them over Paladin for 5man groups. Paladins are just so limited due to only having single target heals. Druids can more easily deal with heavy group wide damage and Nature's Swiftness has saved my tank more times than I can count.
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker) 
---
Ret paladin. Nugh said :o
---
Not even close. Spinal Reaper is a lot more common of a drop than BRE so more people use it, but even with just one proc up BRE is doing comparable damage to Dark Edge. 
---
what? no?
---
They can't gkick you if you gquit first though \\o/
---
Why alliance warlock specifically?
---
Just remember to pay them back, or they take legs.
---
Shah bruh
---
Obviously, you should pick what you like more. In my eyes, Shaman is really boring to play since you just spam your smart chain heal which automatically selects the lowest targets for you, combined with a clunky totem mechanic. Yes, they're very sought after, but I get the feeling that there will be plenty of them.
---
Paladin feels a little bit more engaging and healing with Illumination feels really satisfying. You have the strongest single target heal in the game and a lot of utility. Also, you don't need many points in holy to be effective so you have a lot to spend in e.g. Prot, which lets you tank 5-mans and makes you tankier for pvp. Also, your lvl 40 mount is free.
---
You can watch some pally and shaman raid PoVs to see which play style you find more engaging.
---
Your fav. healing spec?
---
Why didnt you play your class right? I mean expecting the paladin to carry you is bad enough.. Just hit your keyboard once in a while.
---
Because phonetically they sound the same, you’d have to deliberately make them sound different 
---
Horde, personally I find their cities and zones to be much more interesting, and I love their story/characters. Not to mention they have female orc shamans.
---
Ironforge is pretty nice though...
---
US east we all pronounced it "*Shaw-Men"
---
Even on private servers there are players who play casually, and here on Reddit you are only going to bump into the most vocal. 
---
I'm certain there will be a range of players coming to play Classic when it drops, don't worry.
---
&gt; Yeah no, this is exactly what I mean when I talk about toxic people who pretend like they don't know what's offensive or not. 
---
Wow, so I am toxic and offensive now. I guess I should just kill myself.
---
&gt; There's tasteful comedy, and there's offensive rhetoric. This is the nuance I described above. Any reasonable adult can tell the difference between the two. 
---
Yes I am sorry, while I agree that in principle there are just certain things that are unreservedly offensive, like telling someone in all seriousness that they should kill themselves, if we get into the specifics about comedy, there is some people that find some things funny and not offensive at all or more importantly, don't feel the need to report or dissociate themselves from that joke. Once again, I don't think this line of argument is really relevant. We can go on for hours about who thinks what, but how many people you have on your side and how many people I have on my side shouldn't matter. It is just what is rational that is important. I can give you a long list of events that have transpired in history, where the majority have been wrong.
---
&gt; This is something that's decided upon by culture, not you. You don't get to say "Well, the N word isn't offensive to me, but the word mute is. 
---
Of course I can decide what is offensive to myself, who other than individuals can decide what is offensive. I don't understand your point about a culture deciding what is offensive, a culture does not have brain. So of course I can say that the N word doesn't offend me, because that is true, I have built quite a relationship with myself. One of the main reasons for that being, is that it is not necessarily racists that use that word. I mean black people frequently use that word to describe each other. The word mute is not offensive to me, but the idea of silencing others because you find their ideas or words offensive, does.
---
&gt; So, I get to say the N word all I want, and you can't mute me because that's offensive to me!" That's the kind of argument a preteen makes. 
---
Here is a few issues. First of all there is a difference between harassing someone, saying what you want and the right to freedom of speech. So if you repeatedly send someone a message, irrespective of what it is, annoying him, then that is not rational and I will never endorse that. I am advocating that each person should have the **right** to say almost anything, not that you should actually just say anything, which is an important distinction. I am asking for neutrality from Blizzard, that they should not try to adjudicate this issue, but that does not mean and I do not want, people just to then go out and insult each other.
---
&gt; If you can't discern between what's offensive or not, then you're not fit to interact with other people. Stay off the internet until you can figure it out. 
---
I would submit to you that that is offensive. By your standards, if I understand you correctly, I should now be able to report you and you will possible receive a 24 hour mute if you had said that in game. Do you think that would be right? I don't. I believe that just as I request your leniency in the things I say, I will definitely afford you the same. 
---
Neither paladins or shaman are good farmers. I'd say paladin is slower to kill but never stops, shaman can kill very fast but will need to regen.
---
IMO if you want to DPS PVP go shaman. If you want to heal PVP go pally.
---
We had one in my guild. Lithanial on Al'Akir in &lt;Mesmerize&gt; He and Grim used to PvP a lot together and he raided as Moonkin.
---
3000 damage Ravage crits on mages tho
---
Ah, yeah your clear times are ok for actual vanilla IIRC, but that's really slow on a pserv in my experience.  Most groups, even pugs, clear in 1-2hrs.
---
I imagine because most locks go horde if they intend to pvp at all - otherwise WOTF and tremor totem is a bad time
---
TBH I can't wait
---
If you don't clear Naxx 2 weeks after release your life is basically worthless !
---
Hah, he's the reason I rolled Druid in the first place. Ofc looking at his videos now, the opponents are playing absolutely atrocious. But still it looked like a lot of fun.
---
Horde can break fear in PvP by: 50%+ undead playerbase, warriors, tremor totem shamans.  So basically 80%+ of the playerbase has an answer to fear on horde side.
---
If you dont go out of your way farming LIPs or get great +stam gear like R13 or T2 warlocks are at a disadvantage in PvP in uncoordinated PvP.
---
More hardcore players have no problem going WL because paladins BoFing and cleansing corruptions are bullshit to deal with as hordie, but for that you need to play in a set group of friends to be effective in PvP. 
---
Horde can just go orc and rofl stomp even their nemesis rogues with a bit of stun resist luck.
---
I feel like I'm being left out of the joke because I missed this meme somewhere in the past.  
---
As a priest who is healing a prot paladin every week I don't think their mitigation is particularly bad. It's not optimal, I want to point that out. It's not detrimental either though. The thing is that mitigation isn't really an important thing for tanks now that we don't have 200-300ms latency on heals. This is why most MTs grab dps gear over melee dps to boost their TPS since threat is a bigger issue than damage reduction. Also the reason why MTs start dual-wielding instead of going sword and board. A prot paladin can't do this and as such lacks a lot of single target TPS. Even then though, our prot paladin manages to solo tank bosses, somehow.. He's primarily there as an OT though and will whip out his Nightfall whenever he can. 
---
Heh the people who really want to feral sure are downvoting you, even in spite of the respect you show. Typical enough
---
I disagree, I believe the majority of people who will play Classic will be solo casuals with maybe one or two IRL friends. 
---
We just don't hear from them on here so it's easy to think otherwise.
---
It's not your call. It is their game and they will do what needs to be done.
---
The only two official things we can rely on so far are:
---
1. The release date is some time during Summer 2019
---
1. One of the last few Blue Posts said: ["Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer!"](https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8364-WoW-Classic-Update) - which leads many people to believe that it's likely to release in the beginning of summer, and not near the end.
---
Other than that there were [a few possible hints during the BlizzCon Classic Panel](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/) that lead many people to believe that Blizzard is aiming for July 16 2019.
---
Personally, I too believe that a July 16 release is likely and that Blizzard only hinted at it, so that they can easily postpone it if something goes wrong. The fact that we've got so many Blue Posts in the last few weeks leads me to believe that they are still on track with that "plan". I'm aware that most of that is just wishful thinking on my part - but a man can dream 😁 ^^^Just ^^^a ^^^bit ^^^over ^^^100 ^^^days ^^^to ^^^go!
---
Generally completing the quests is faster. However, if you're a frost mage, you might find grinding in certain spots with enemies particularly suited for their brand of AoE grinding more time efficient.
---
I played a shaman in vanilla and had a blast. When I was leveling (PVP server), I felt confident I could take any alliance character I ran into up to about eight levels above me. The only times I died to them was if my windfury didn't proc enough.
---
The Dwarf hunter with his bear!!
---
youre acting pretty stupid
---
just scroll around. rankings are DOMINATED by priests and paladins
---
Yeah but theyre very popular too, compared to warlock for instance, or druid
---
Ahh, the old buggy private server argument. Care to explain WHAT is the issue with private servers exactly? Because nobody ever does.
---
The reason Druids can tank is that having 15k health, 30% dodge and the bosses critting you for 3000 damage means you will never die before healers can heal you up.
---
Unless you somehow think private servers got armor mechanics, boss mechanics, dodge mechanics and hp from stamina scaling or every other basic game mechanic wrong, Druids WILL be tanking in Classic.
---
If you think otherwise, please explain why. If you are just going to repeat that private servers are buggy, then isnt it equally probable that private servers might be harder than Vanilla and not easier?
---
Arena was complete shit and a contributing element to the ruin of the concept of Classic Wow. It put players into even SMALLER instances outside of the main game and forced balance changes to fit the mini-game that is arena.
---
I view arena lovers as the 1st core audience that contributed to the ruin of Wow.
---
Two things.
---
1. If min/maxers in World of Warcraft are the worst people you've ever encountered, you've had a very good life, my friend. Kudos.
---
Ask one to move?  
---
Stay away from the shaman if you are a gamer dad. So many wipes caused by suddenly AFK shamans not being able to move totems and pulling whatsoever. 
---
You're wrong. Accept it and get over it. Easy. 
---
I shall join your guild. For too long have Melee Hunters been denied the glory that is rightfully theirs!
---
What did ya do? 
---
As a player who only cares about PvP i would like it if there is a culture of letting "sub par" speccs raid so they get to gear for pvp. Raiding is a means to an end for me and i dont want the teammates who are these "sub par" class/specc combos to not have any gear because they are not ideal for a part of the game.
---
The honor system is flawed and most of us must raid to get top notch gear to PvP in.
---
I get that people dont want to waste time but some middelground is prefereable to me since the PvP ecosystem is my cheif concern
---
It really is the best thing about not having sharding/cross realm.
---
You get to know people, you add complete strangers you've grouped with as friends and you can build a reputation for yourself.
---
You add crafters and herbalists as friends and contact them direct to buy.
---
&gt; Feel free to disagree I’ll have a pocket healer anyways so I’m not to worried about my oppinion being considered shitty.
---
It's just a common thing for people who refuse to ever heal to complain about healers not being good enough
---
Care to argue why? If not I think it's safe to assume you dont actually know what you are talking about.
---
So what is "elitism" then?
---
I’m not, but keep thinking that. There are plenty of other people who can attest to it on this post alone, not sure why OP only attacked me.

I'll just pay whatever the accepted rate ends up being on my server. For example if Mages generally get 50s or 1g or whatever for a portal then that's what I'll pay.
---
Alexi Barov is ripping you off, man!
---
This whole thing is a sham!
---
Thats pretty funny and sad at the same time. I loved how the game was in vanilla/bc where I had to do the old raids to get to the new ones. And the power gap was not so extreme
---
Don't need legs if you got a mount! 
---
Hey man, I was just poking back at you. Classic wow is unforgiving, but obviously not like Dark Souls
---
Druid healers are fine as healers as long as you have people who have a basic understanding of their class and what they are doing. The problem with the lack of rez are the people who just want to mindlessly pew-pew and get killed because they're not paying attention. Those people need to run back until the learn to not be bad. It's elitist to expect people to be good; it's not elitist to expect people to not be bad.
---
I lol’d, done that jump quite a few times :). 
---
Here's my bags in a typical AQ40 raid as a Druid tank:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3rCHpq1.png](https://i.imgur.com/3rCHpq1.png)
---
Notice how I have Sapper Charges? Even though you cannot use them in form, they are still worth bringing. Plenty of opportunities to use them on trash after another tank aoe taunts f.ex. Or on Viscidus.
---
Resto shaman by far. The lower availability of them combined with the fact that you can easily take up to 6-8 of them in a raid in all stages of content makes it obvious. Paladin is also usually a popular class and you don’t need as many of them since their buffs are raid wide. 
---
In vanilla, locks were in demand on all servers I played on, but it seems like it will be a really popular class come classic, probably because they really started shining after their class revamp 
---
Those early cata heroics were a lot of fun though 
---
As an australian where tips dont exist. Tips are stupid. Just quote me a price and I'll decide if it's worth it or not. 
---
The I’m bored jump also includes attempting to jump over the downward path drop at the front of IF while waiting for a raid to form!
---
I suppose a “play shit, get hit” mentality is pretty fair, especially if there’s nothing the Druid can do about it. 
---
No need to hold it, I just use my trusty poop sock 
---
He was the man. One of my favorite memories was losing a 1v1 against him when we were both level 52 (I was a shaman) right outside the Temple of Hakkar. Hopefully the new WoW classic can create a similar ambiance/excitement level.
---
&gt; A fury warrrior or a rogue with a healer can do dm east jump runs.
---
This is both not going to be in at the beginning and highly speculative. DM-E jump runs might not be a thing you can do in classic due to any number of blizzard choices, and even if they leave it in just as it is in pirate servers you need a fair amount of gear to make it worthwhile. 
---
They sound completely different. I can't even make them sound similar without deliberately pronouncing them wrong. 
---
The demo was based on the legion client. It will more than likely be a continuous forked version of the more recent client to ensure all security and hardware profiles are updated.
---
100% wrong people habe subjective humor and someone downright love offensive jokes. Are anti Christian jokes okay but not the jokes made by PewDiePie?
---
hey now, i'm pretty sure Nightfall hunters will be a thing again in classic...  I was considering leveling one.
---
Its classic and its funny. Seems relevant to me
---
The disguises really don't do much, bear has rage, cat has energy and it's classic so nobody is going into moonkin. 
---
I was guilty of this back when I started. As annoying as it must have been for my party, I can't help but laugh about it now!
---
August 26 ! 
---
STVietnam is the biggest warzone. Hillsbrad Foothills and Ashenvale are the first two contested zones that have both factions active in them so they tend to be hot as well. Endgame zones as well as there's always 60s there farming things.
---
Blackrock Mountain was always dangerous to hang around too long in. You go in as a group and hit your instance portal, you don't hang around. 
---
fun fact, ally warlock is stronger than horde, it's a complete rumor that ally warlock is weak, but everyone believes it, because "entire opposite faction immune to fear" sounds like compelling argument, and thus few warlocks roll ally.
---
You played all of wow running@  1 FPS?! That’s incredible! (orc voice) 
---
People who use ‘dense’ are pieces of shit 
---
Yep. People dont realize it, but Druids are capable of producing the highest throughput of all healers in the right conditions.
---
But NOT to Classic WoW.
---
Sorry kid
---
The problem with the design and as a result is the notion that Hybrid classes in vanilla aren't pure dps classes. 
---
I wish they were geared towards a support role, bringing any hybrid class for the buffs and dps they provide to pure classes. I'd be comfortable in a support role where your contribution provides a boost to 4 other members in your party. BC scratched the surface of this but even then people got shit on for not pulling numbers. 
---
Unless you like blowing people up in PvP using LB+Chain Lightning and Earth Shock, then imo Shamans have the most boring offspecs out of all classes. Enhancement is bottom of the barrel in usefulness, and Elemental is really niche.
---
What makes you also not dense right now? Because your just as stubborn. I gave you legit reasons as to why this is a neglegable amount of gold and your persistent that its alot. Even to the most casual players there is little you can do at 60 with that much gold. You can barely buy a stack of food.
---
There are opportunities to do something like that. AoE taunt+Limited Invulnerability Potion + Battle Res or Innervate f.ex.
---
Well, after 2 hours of looking a tank for a dungeon that doenst drop Tank gear, dps get a little desesperate
---
Considering armor cap is what? 21000 armor vs level 63? No way.
---
I can tell you right now, he had the spell.
---
Odds are you or your group pissed him off and he would rather have you run.
---
Because you play with a group. Innervating the priest will \*almost\* always be the highest net gain in healing across the raid over innervating yourself.
---
You should check my profile, speaking of dwarves
---
&gt;Remember that Fear Ward has a 3 minute cooldown and only negates 1 fear effect during its 3 minute duration. 
---
Remember that the Fear Ward that you got in TBC is *not* vanilla Fear Ward. They nerfed the crap out of that ability when giving it for free to all races. In vanilla it had a 10 minute duration with a 30 second cooldown.
---
For vulgar language there is a filter. For every thing else, there is ignore
---
You keep citing modern WoW prices, in classic I assure you 2 gold would’ve been a lot more than you understand it to be. 
---
OP is baiting mate relax.
---
The amount of people actually thinking this is alot of gold is actually blowing my mind right now. I made this post to laugh at what the quest giver says, but he gives you practically nothing. There is almost nothing you can do at 60 with 2g. You can barely even buy a stack of 45 food from a vendor even. 2g is alot before lvl 20, but you still need 100 for your mount. And if you plan on raiding and getting your epic mount your spending 1000's of gold in the end and most of the time in large chunks from 50-200 or even 1000 gold.
---
I played a shaman healer recently, and it hurts seeing all these people thinking priests will be the only healers worth a damn.  The fastest, or smartest, healer of any class will always be the best/top healer.
---
In my experience as a healing officer, innervate usually just goes to the best healer, or the healer that fucked up their budgeting.  Innervate is great for every healer in vanilla since it's based on overall mana regen and not yet solely spirit based.  That being said, it's still better for druid/priest than shaman/pally ofc.
---

I still dont understand why you think I'm talking modern wow. I'm literally playing vanilla right now and dont give me that private servers arnt accurate bullshit. Alot of stuff is well documented on sites such as classicDB.
---
Just sit in the forest grinding boars
---
How do you get those wonderful shots?
---
A couple of vanilla grey items that vendor for about 1g or more
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=13819

---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=13823
---
This was a 2min search and there are plenty more. You start getting grey items that vendor for about 1g in your mid 40s.
---
Is this because of the abstract "warlocks have the racial "has paladins""?
---
Yep, I feel this watered the game down a lot. If someone dont want to play multiples roles they have other classes to choose from. No need to change the Druid.
---
On the private server I play on I raid as feral in 40mans. It works out quite well. I can tank trash and bosses where more than two tanks are needed. DPS on trash and bosses where I am not needed as a tank, or decurse on Chromaggus, Abolish on Viscidus, even heal when called upon.
---
You are a very versatile raidmember when played raid. Just gotta use the full class and not just stick to one form.
---
A big part of it is yes. 
---
Don't forget the Island far north-West (north of BFD) is an Alliance quest hub, and if you kill one there he'll have the pleasure of experiencing one of the longest corpse runs in the game ! 6-8 mins of corpse running guarranteed, and because of the uneven Ashenvale landscape, it's not possible to auto-run it, so he'll have to sit in front of his computer during all of it.
---
Do what you want with that information now. I can only say that an Horde Druid with Aquatic Form can have a lot of fun there :P
---
Removed as a copy pasta/low-effort (Rule #7).
---
That's what I covered in the teamplay aspect. 
---
In a solo wPvP situation orc is probably the strongest negating 30% of tidal charms, nades, HoJs, charges, intercepts etc. etc.
---
Gnomes escape artist is not bad, but I take hardiness any day of the week seeing how rogues are the nemesis of under to average geared warlocks without LIPs who literally die in a stunlock.
---
Embrace the nature of a *massive* MORPG?  
---
Warlocks supported by paladins mob the floor with anything horde can throw at them.
---
Agree with this. I also rush to Omen of Clarity after getting Faerie Fire Feral and the 20% increased Claw damage as that produces higher overall damage than going HoTW (you get natural weapons from balance for 10% physical damage)
---
very few people actually rolled shaman back in vanilla.
---
You dont get it for the cat. You get it for instant Charge/Stun in Bear Form. Both those spells are interrupts, and extremely valuable for PvP and also questing.
---
That is just one thing I won't buy as a lover of both classic and arenas. How did arenas ruin the game completely? I understand that it made BG:s a somewhat casual game-mode, but aside from premades how did it affect normal players?
---
well it was a shit show last night on some unnamed server. corpses all down the main road.
---
The actual difference is miniscule.
---
Orc is fucking amazing yes. I am fully aware. I support the argument that horde is stronger in solo play because of orc being retardedly OP, but the difference that is, doesn't make up for how weak horde warlock is in premades.
---
Could be, but the recent polls indicate they are very popular this time around, right after warrior actually. Private servers have same kind of class division too.
---
Correct. Especially if you compare it to any other profession - it is unprofitable at every stage of the game. Even skinning is more profitable.
---
People think they're going to get a rare recipe and get rich.
---
Just consider this: on a mature server you can get a Crusader enchant for 10g tip. That's nothing.
---
With even *base* recipes, alchemy can easily make 10g in a day, paired with herbalism, even more. Even with basic low level potions like GFPP, Swiftness Potion, FAP, etc.

It’s been a long time and the spec charts aren’t working on my phone. I will have to look tonight after dinner and get back to you.
---
I always advise classes that can't farm well or not efficient to take enchanting. it is a risk-free profession. just sit in your capital city and take a fee for each enchants ( e.x Crusader fee 10g - Fiery weapon 3g ) and so on.
---
in late Vanilla I had enchanting but it wasn't good cuz most of the formulas ( the good ones ) dropped from raid bosses.
---
in nutshell. get enchanting if your guild or friends want you to take it. and make sure they help you to get the recipes.
---
Nah. Spirit tap is more than enough 
---
It’s very well possible but it would be rare to have a great boomkin that would be worth giving up one of ten spots in for a WSG. Not to discount what you are saying in anyway. I just believe it would be few and far between. Like a 1 in a 1000 boomkins would be good and viable. 
---
both of you spec holy til consecrate and then at 30 one respecs prot for blessing of sanctuary. You run devotion - ret auras and at 30 you can easily consecrate aoe groups of 12 mobs if the prot spec is in full int gear healing the holy tank "ironic i know". I am leveling a paladin with aoe build and it is one of the most fun builds I have ever played, especially because I am experimenting with + def green items. Currently lvl 35 with something like 50-75 defense over my level, calculates out to be something like 7% block 7% parry 6% dodge 41% armor mitigation. But I don't have the benefit of sanctuary yet because I am solo and can't lose consecrate to get it.
---
Eh, from my experience emergencies tend to be guaranteed wipes regardless. Like oh shit we pulled two packs and now we're totally boned. I really wouldn't be surprised if waiting for a non-lost cause emergency just means you never use it in most runs, but then I've never really healed as a Druid in dungeons so I haven't exactly kept any statistics on the matter.
---
Absolutely. No nightfall shadowbolts for you, mister. Unstable affliction would've been great for vanilla horde warlocks.

---
Thanks! 
---
Wow, this was actually quite interesting to read! In regard to PvP, no suprises that the Undead rogue is the most likely ganker. 
---
Using "time to level 60" as a proxy for hardcore seems about right. I have seen far more dodgy proxies being used in practice elsewhere. 
---
Happy to see that not all players choose class/race combo purely based on racial abilities :)
---
It is what it is. It’s the truth based on original. But people are coming into this game with a whole new mind set and players understand how to raid. There will be more viable end game raiding guilds in my opinion this time around so a more diverse player base could support more obscure raiding specs. 
---
Warrior, dwarf priest, mage, in respective order.
---
Sharding is going to mitigate that problem. In fact, I'm going to try and hit all 3 lowbie zones while sharding is in place just to be sure I get them all done more quickly.
---
Bad healer is bad. If you are a priest and have to res people every single dungeon there is a lot of room for improvement, or the content is too difficult. If you have to res people a lot as a priest, you’ll die a lot too, and then no one gets a res.
---
Even if they're a popular class they're still going to be in very high demand. You usually bring along like 8 or 9 per raid
---
We priests need at least some super power! Vanilla is great because druids DON’T have the ability to rez people constantly out of combat. I think it’s super cool how rez mechanics worked in vanilla. High risk, high fun!
---
The damage of Natural Weapons over HotW is only slightly higher, depending on gear it can even be lower, but HotW also gives you more stats overall, not just damage, which greatly increases its per point value over Natural Weapons. OoC is very poweful though. It's a tough comparison there. If you just care about grinding speed then your way is probably better. But considering we would be around lvl 40+ where visiting dungeons becomes more and more impactful it might be better to have the HotW value so you can heal and tank better.
---
Literally a song about classic. How exactly is it not relevant?
---
I raided hardcore as a resto shaman on a private server semi-recently.  A few things of note:  Totems are neat in pvp, but in pve they're just a hassle.  Elemental gear is actually very easy to pick up in raids, but enhancement gear is rarely going to come your way with how much melee there is.  Except maybe a 2h weapon since most are garbage.  In pvp you're strong if you're ignored, but if you get focused you're gonna have a bad time.  Your best heal, chain heal, is also kinda garbage in MOST pvp situations.  Enhance has to get lucky or you're gonna get kited and not be able to do anything about it.  As a healer in raids, other than keeping up totems.. It's probably 80% a 1 button class, same as pallies.  Pallies are strong healers from the start though, since FoL is incredibly efficient.  As a shaman, be prepared to suck early on due to chain heal's high mana cost.
---
I played druid too.  
---
What spec did you heal as?  
---
I used 00/30/21 (was only druid permitted to do so in raid)
---
Poor thursby has been through enough already!
---
Lol, when I went I quit wow and went off to college, I actually did end up partying and doing drugs.
---
As a counter argument, it's one more thing to zap people with as you run past them or wait at the zeppelin. And that's always fun.
---
Southeast Un'goro is basically just a bunch of raptors; it's the entire West of the crater that will destroy you with its hordes of elites.
---
How is this so innate lmao
---
This is the best answer for horde.  Our raids were only as strong as the amount of shamans we could get to come.  Horde melee without windfury won't keep up, and the 20% threat reduction for casters is just a 20% damage increase.
---
The chart you listed has a Druid at the top of the heals ranking BTW.
---
To give you a reference. We were the one of the top raiding guilds in the world by the time Naxx was released and 3 of our top 5 healers were Druid. 
---
Idkn what number your pulling from but I will assume they are from private servers. Now is not then. I am talking about then. 
---
Good day.
---
Did you not read the formula I just posted for you? Priest's regen is spirit divided by four, while Druid's is spirit divided by five. That's a 20% difference. Not what I would call "miniscule".
---
In CRPG terms, it was first Obsidian via Project Eternity (that would later become Pillars of Eternity) that really showed everyone how much of a market still existed for isometric RPGs. The kickstarted really blew up. Shortly after, Larian picked up the scent and followed suit along with many others.
---
In a sense it is funny but only tells half of the story. Cooking only slows down leveling by a tiny bit while giving very powerful buffs and basically free food. If you are lvl 60 and then level cooking you'll actually be spending gold on the AH for all that meat that you now obviously don't want to grind yourself.
---
My advice: If you ever want to level cooking then do it while leveling. It is super easy to keep up like for example skinning or first aid.
---
Don't worry, I'll just camp your corpse on your way to MC.
---
I have to look tonight memory isn’t doing me any favors right now.
---
Happens everytime.
---
What shocked me about Cata were the changes in Gameplay. Players HP multiplied by 4, but their Damage only by two, which considerably slowed PvP. To make things worse, all classes got healing abilities and defensive CDs ... Healers were completely unkillable in PvP. You had to gang up on them with 3 people, and they still would simply jump around an insta heal themselves for a while before dying. Mobs however were way less durable, and leveling XP was cut, which made the whole leveling process dumb down and tasteless .
---
That said, Uldum and Hyjal were simply stunning. Uldum in particular was such a superb looking zone, it topped most of what WotLK had to offer. Cata dungeons and raids were cool, too. The well of Eternity dungeon was impressive. Twin Peaks was just a mediocre remake of WSG, Tol'Barad dailies were nice but quickly boring. Old zones remakes were completely pointless IMO, and too much content was cut out (class quests for example). 
---
If Blizzard had kept WotLK's PvP gameplay, a similar leveling process to what existed before, and if they didn't swiftly nerf the Heroics, maybe Cataclysm could have done well in the end. But that's not what they decided, and instead they brutally modified everything to make it diametrically different. I still can't understand that decision, it makes no sense at all.
---
Nope. 
---
What that mouth do tho?
---
You watched some other video bro. I don't know what to tell you man. 
---
Could be OP posted a playlist, but the song that is there is some dudes in white at a flipping NBA game. NOT anything to do with Classic WoW.
---
Very good argument
---
There's no such thing. it depends on guild/server/randomness.
---
Generally shaman/paladin for raids and anything with a decent tank set for dungeon are safe bets. Still depends tho.
---
It's between this and Searing Gorge as "Best Quest Zone" imo. Both share something in common: a lot of stacking quests in the same areas that are just "GO KILL THINGS".
---
How does balance feel in classic? I loved playing it during WotlK.
---
There's been deflation with the latest expansion, but it's  more than 100:1 still 
---
The funny thing is that trash farming for gold is more profitable in Legion (now) than BFA. They nerfed/removed the gold quests that made Legion have such ridiculous amounts of gold, but not the incredibly common 2-6g trash drops
---
Auctions, auctions, and more auctions.
---
Just from my own experience having played 3 Druids since Nostalrius. Hunters are Warlocks are by far the worst classes for me to fight. They have a lot of ways to keep you CC'ed and they have both high burst.
---
The hunter pet is incredibly difficult to deal with. You can sleep/root it, but the Hunter can dispel those with improved Mend Pet. The pets make it very difficult to get casts off as well, and you are vulnerable to Viper Sting every time you leave your forms.
---
I personally love T1 Pally set, not for PVE but stacking the 8/8 with SoL and Darkmoon card heroism allows for some ridiculous solo content and aoe grind potential. Make sure to also use SoR for double procs on your healing.
---
What really bothered me was gold bars, large pieces of solid gold, vendored for what, 10s or something?
---
Yes, but it's time consuming. And the Tauren starting area is so low density for quests anyway. It's also relaxing, so you feel no need to hustle. I plan to power level an Orc Shaman and then leisurely level a Tauren warrior or hunter.
---
Those guides. Really... Classic
---
So you’ll switch out, sapper, then switch back? That’s cool. 
---
I had a raid one time where our master looter decided he’d throw gray items in my bags from trash mobs. Jokes on him, I didn’t have enough space, lol. 
---
Even there, you need to be careful.  Green weapons, for example, will always sell for more than the enchanting mats are worth.  Even some armors are more valuable as vendor trash than they are as enchanting mats.  If you're trying to turn a profit on enchanting, you'll need to be very aware of the chances of an item breaking down into what mats and the current market value of those mats.  Otherwise, you can piss away your small profits from DEing by DEing things you should've vendored.
---
also life stealing enchant
---
What you wrote is simply not true. There are no pieces of gear that vendor for 300g 
---
Damn, inflation hit the economy hard after the scourge invasion.
---
At cost, generally.  It'd be like making dinner for your family and then charging them for it.  Everyone has professions, everyone uses those professions in guild for the good of the guild.
---
Had to make an account(this is my first reddit post) and create something for this wonderful subreddit, have a nice weekend!
---
The point I’m trying to make still stands, you can do an old raid in 5-10 minutes and make 300g. 1g in vanilla is not 100g retail. Takes a lot longer at a lower level.
---
I didn’t expect to get some kind of criticism for such a simple comment but I guess reddit is reddit
---
... good info to have. &gt;_&gt;
---
But no druid would ever forget to have plenty of that on hand...
---
*shifty eyes*
---
The middle ground is letting these specs in on alt runs, after the content becomes face roll. The other middle ground is knowing your guild and discussing exceptions beforehand. I'm all for having a few off specs in the raid with the idea of PvP in the future. I'm not addressing those things, I'm addressing this idea that seems to be spreading that everyone will be just fine playing whatever the hell they want and the entitlement in expecting a raid invite that comes with it. 
---
People underestimate how tanky pets are. My best option is usually trying to hibernate/root the pet and hope the hunter dont have improved mend or bestial wrath.
---
One of my best friends was a warlock who hated summoning folks.  When we would go to Azshara for the dragon, he would literally summon folks off the ledge to their death; in BRM, they would drop into the lava.  Then our guild said... "If you really want to raid, you will be there, flasks ready, potions, bandages, and mind-set ready -- there will be NO summons."
---
Ooooooh, yea he posted a playlist lol. The video he wants you to watch is "thats the world of warcraft that you play" 
---
Everyone is entitled to an opinion but this one is just stupid... arena is probably one of the only remaining areas of wow that is truely not for casuals. Vanilla pvp is INCREDIBLY more casual than arena, you could get rank 14 by just logging into the game, arena you actually have to be skilled.
---
At least we'll have gift books at or near launch, right?
---
Was it wrath that gave everyone mass res, or Cata?
---
I remember as a mage, standing in ORG, simply making waters for the pvp'ers.  This was DM water, and the shammies, druids, locks, heck, even the rogues would come and fill up their bags with water for their priest-ie friends.  Best times ever, we would be there for hours.  It was the preface to AV turtles.
---
There's two items that drop from the same boss in ZG, but it's one of the 4 Madness bosses (requires mats to be summoned) who alternate every ~2 weeks.
---
It's a [1h mace](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19961) and [2h axe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19962).
---
Sounds like he's thinking of PVP, though, and how often do you R4 in PVP?
---
Of course not... 
---
You are wrong!
---
I used to run mine nodes in here because they were always up!! 
---
&gt; They also made death knight raise ally into a proper combat rez.
---
Which annoys me. Turn me into a ghoul to DPS suicide? Awesome!
---
Well I was, but I thought they said there won’t be any at launch..
---
Question : You say Warlocks are in the middle of What they can farm between Mages and Hunters.  Wouldn't it go Hunters &gt; mages &gt; Warlocks ? May i ask your reasoning on this? as i personally feel AoE farming in the Sneaky Darkshore spot as a mage out weights the ability to do Mara and part of DM:E as a Warlock.
---
I *am* the dick who never trained Fear Ward, too.
---
Your time in game is no more important than any other's.  If you want to dungeon, get to the chopper.  If not, there are plenty more players who want that loot and xp.
---
My experience was you did it at cost.
---
There's a lot of things that was changed in vanilla and I don't think we should necessarily be completely progressive. But from the list you made here's my opinion on how it should be dealt with:
---
*Epic gear should not drop nexus shards before AQ, there's no recipes to use nexus shards for, and having guilds stock these up months in advance to AQ makes the entire uniqueness of these AQ enchants pointless. I've played on Pservers that did both versions, and we had like 2 bags full of STACKS of nexus shards, the AQ enchants was basically free.
---
*Sagefish, Rumsey Black label &amp; fishing school
---
I don't have an issue with this being on launch. You can definitely argue that having that extra stam and mana regen help progression, obviously it does, but I think overall replace of early raids is neccesary with 1.12 anyway, and that should include this buff. I want fishing to be a fun and useful 2ndary profession throughout the game, and it really isn't before schools(which includes sage and rumsey). 
---
*Greater fire power, These were added in patch 1.11 and I don't really have much on an opinion on them, fire mages are strong in AQ already, and they don't need this before. I wouldn't be against them being there either though as an more expensive consumable than the normal fire power.
---
*CH, LHC quests etc. including silithus cultists, the wormmeat stuff, ooze covered rich thorium etc. should all be released with raids as blizzlike as it's content that is meant for these raids and not something that should be done in advance
---
Excellent point 
---
Fair enough, theres been a lot of time to optimize what trash you need to kill and what not.
---
It’s not reflected by this poll, but I’ve always had trouble finding priests, for 5-man or MC. One guild actually had everyone bring restorative potions for MC because we didn’t have enough priests to dispell Lucifron’s debuff. 5 man, is usually just because I love priest healers, but of a bias I guess. Shamans rock too because of totems. 
---
Don't forget about The Hinterlands. Good amount of gold to be made there.
---
I honestly miss how hard gold and bags were to get in vanilla. I hate the mass inflation of every expansion. 
---
Fear ward has 30s cd
---
\#1 A good tank
---
\#2 Paladins/Shamans.
---
Hinterlands is terrible for Alliance. It's really good for Horde though.
---
Hey man at level 5 in old-school vanilla 1g80s is like that ducktails mountains of gold shit
---
For me, it's shah-men.
---
Does anyone know what render distance options they will have available in Classic? I think the fog legitimately adds to the atmosphere in areas like this. (Areas like Durotar, not so much.) 
---
@ CharcuterieBoard. A few posts above, Clickrush provided just a few links with grays that sold for a few gs. It looks like DuggerX is talking modern WoW, because he is talking about private servers. You are remembering Vanilla wrong, which is not a big deal. Yes, 1-2g was a lot when you were early leveling. But not after you're like 30, 40+. You'll see soon enough when you play classic!
---

They said they won't change the raids ;) Also sagefish is weaker than nightfin that is from the start but is much easily fishable in large quantities.
---
I feel like they're going to do a sale or special on their 6 month subscription package the same way they had that pirate ship whenever you'd get a 6 month. Ironically they wanted you to buy a ship to keep their ship from going down.  
---
It would piss a lot of people off, but honestly they'd rake in so much cash if they gave "beta access" or something like that for the classic realm to those that buy a 6 month sub. Either that or a 2-3 day start could make launch a lot easier and solidify some fans into subs.
---
I had a job like that, which was managing the front desk of an apartment. It was shit 99% of the time because eventually you just run out of stuff to do. Really nice for big game releases though. 
---
*ahem*
---
SELLING HJs UNDER THE HRIDGE FOR 13 SILVER! MY HANDS ARE SOFTER AS WELL! 
---
&gt;sagefish is weaker than nightfin that is from the start but is much easily fishable in large quantities.
---
This is true.
---
I don't know about not changing raids though, I think once they realize how boring blizzlike raiding is, that something will change. We'll have to see. 
---
I had to mod skyrim for that exact problem. 
---
Trying to prevent a scary larger male from killing you by acting cute and harmless is almost certainly genetically encoded
---
when you wpvp as feral, can your opponent escape if he wants to?
---
I remember I would live in peace with people but then they would accidentally pull 2 mobs or be low on HP and couldn't resist just finishing them off for the kill. I felt no shame. 
---
Gaming journalism is a joke.
---
God no lol 
---
There will be normal RP realms though. Those are generally *better* for roleplaying because you can't get ganked while RPing in contested zones.
---
Yep I’ll be tanking all my dungeons. 
---
No i mean the style of farming. Hunters excell at killing hard morbs, even bosses alone. Mages excell at killing many, weaker mobs with AoE. Warlocks are betwen Hunters and Mages in that regard.
---
Pretty much the reason I just kill everyone I see
---

I've personally witnessed pallies tanking Nef and Prophet Skeram back in retail vanilla, but I haven't found videos of them yet. 
---
Searching for paladins tanking naxx is being a pain in the rear because all the results come back with the 25m raid from WotLK.
---
I'm most surprised that I can't find a paladin tanking Shaz since that guy is basically a piñata.
---
I guess I'll keep looking!
---
Call it scummy or just being efficient but if you can see the item being looted you can learn where it spawns. Then just go grind mobs real quick for like 4 mins then come back and hold shift and just spam right click on the exact location it spawns.  Barring any latency stuff the second the item spawns you’ll begin looting. 
---
If your tank is competent there is no heavy group damage in 5 mans. As a tank main I’d only take a druid if I had a hybrid already in the group. 
---
Genuine horror? Un'Goro is one of the best zones!
---
I'm so sorry for being an ass on your very first Reddit post, but in general, we try and avoid posts that only serve to bash BFA without any discussion. Stuff slips through, but we do our best. This isn't because we are BFA super-fans (I don't even know if anyone on the mod team besides myself has tried BFA), but because of Rule #1, which we enforce to try and keep posts focused on Classic.
---
So, with that said, I'm removing your post... and I'm sorry for that, I genuinely feel bad about it, but I try to maintain consistency when moderating. Please don't let my moderation scare you away from Reddit, Classic, or r/ClassicWoW, and thanks for your understanding.

Any priority you may have in a guild: LF a guild that will be raiding during the above time frame. I've played on a couple private servers casually leveling various characters. I don't have experience raiding. I plan to hit 60 within 2 weeks of rl time and with my leveling guide I think I can achieve this. After my PTO for launch subsides; I'm planning to play around 3-5 hours per night with more on weekends. My overall goal for vanilla is to find people who look at raiding as the required mats for pvp. Not to say I don't think I will enjoy raiding, I just know where my heart's desire truly lies. I enjoy competition, planning, and becoming a better player.  
---
A preferred form of contact: PM me here please if you think I might be a good fit for your guild.
---
I want to RP-PVP
---
If anything there will be more people playing not less 
---
Shah-man
---
It’s just the aging process then
---
There could be 20 others doing the same.
---
Tank - Warriors
---
Healers - it varies a lot, but paladin/shaman is probably the safest bet. Dwarf priests are also wanted.
---
DPS - a GOOD fury warrior is always in demand. Alliance typically has a shortage on locks
---
How many hours did you play daily and for how long to get to Marshal (R12 iirc)?
---
When I first saw it on the talent tree, I thought “gosh, that’s going to be amazing when I get enough points for that!”
---
Yeah, well...
---
The drums of war thunder, once again...
---
1-2g for portals, 5-10g for crafts/enchants
---
Ideally just not at all 
---
They are just really loud...I'd get sick of hearing that all the time if I played a hunter. Just my opinion though. 
---
People might come for the nostalgia. They stay because it's fun for longer than a month, like retail. 
---
I loved Silvermoon but no flying and being in bumfuck nowhere meant that I was rarely there.
---
Well this is some neatly typed out nonsense, simple fact is you don’t act like a cock and you won’t get muted 
---
The old hunting grounds...
---
I liked killing troggs for coin.  I even sang a song while doing it - which my husband endlessly made fun of.
---
♫ *When you're broke your broke, then you go fight Troggs.* ♫
---
Ah you see, she’s not a hot wife, she’s a *hotwife*.
---
Eew 
---
In about 2 hours
---
Which grey item...?
---
Most people don't play in premades
---
Awww, not *made* fun - *had* fun!  Although you did spend an excessive amount of time in the caves by the Loch.
---
Yep, so it peaks then drops off:
---
Of the &lt;25, 44% are Horde
---
25-34, 51% are Horde
---
35+, 46% are horde
---
(samples: 2,937, 6,261 and 977 respectively)
---
Wish the census just allowed open answer on age because we'd have more granularity!
---
But...What does not training fear ward teach someone? It was a Dwarf only ability and had a longish cooldown IIRC. No one would ever learn a lesson if you didn't train that...That just doesn't make sense.
---
It's not just premades.
---
Yes it works. Pretty ok too. Every duo in the game can be effective except 2 warriors. 
---
Are u ok?
---
Faster cast Mana Burn on a Disc priest was a great way to counter another healer in PVP.
---
Personally even though I enjoy Arena, I miss when BGs/world PvP were the focus.
---
One of my most favorite zones and can't wait to get back there! 
---
"can you run me through RFC?" 
---
"No sorry, im busy" 
---
*does laps around org bank*
---
STVs panther/tiger/jaguar quests or whatever the 3 beasts are good for xp as well...although on a pvp server it can get a little hairy .
---
Time is money, friend.
---
You can go full PI disc or hybrid holy/disc. I'd recommend hybrid till you get a little gear
---
**Hybrid:**
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGshbZbvt0c0q
---
You still have five points for either spiritual healing or mental strength. Choose whether you need more +healing, or more mana.
---
**PI:**
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGshiVobxtcc
---
But my all time favorite spec (dont start off with it, it requires gear to be effective) is tri-spec priest pvp:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGsbbZbhtZVMgz0t
---
You spam rank 1 SW:P to prock blackout and shadow-weaving. Rank 1 MF for slow. Improved Psychic Scream and Silence from shadow. 
---
Holy nova for rank 1 holy nova spam (rogues/druids) and benediction/imp mana burn from disc. Great survivability and decent healing with gear. 
---
&gt; I wonder if there was ever some sort of underground WoW bank
---
Well, it wasn't a bank *per se* but I helped run a loan sharking guild in the waning days of vanilla. 50g today, payable 65g in a week. Didn't pay? Well, that's what enemy factions and out-of-server forums are for...prepare to get corpse camped on the regular until you pay up.
---
I also ran a totally legit lottery. /roll two numbers, 1g a ticket, mail me your numbers. Some dude won 3500g when that was life-changing money.
---
I believe that any spec is viable if you find the right guild. The min maxers will tell you that only certain specs will allow you to raid, but that is not necessarily true. 
---
Play what you want to play man. /s
---
I say it Shaw Mun.
---
Nah thats often too risky. But there are plenty of times where you wont be tanking (warriors are better aoe tanks after all) and you can easily use the Sappers. My point is more that they are worth bringing to the raid for reasons other than threat.
---
Something War Staff
---
In what form?
---
Agreed. If someone wants to take the disadvantage and roll something they like, more power to them. Considering playing a shadowpriest myself, but the difference between that and the people I critic is that I accept it will be extra hassle to find a raid group, and that some flat out won’t want me.
---
I only played it a few times it wasn’t as viable as feral or resto in Pvp. My pvp experience was the top group on my server so we were very picky about who we pet in and when we let them in but we played a few times with boomkins but it was a total joke and meant to be a joke. I wouldn’t recommend it but please play what makes you happy.
---
I bet he would have the standalone worst classic experience out of anyone if he went pvp. I honestly feel bad for the guy, you can really tell he just wants to play the game like a normal person, but a mass of players follow him everywhere. He makes a fuckload of money doing it though, so I dont feel that bad, lol. 
---
No one can escape you. With travel form, bear charge, sprint in car form and roots. Remember in vanilla you cans shape shift out of anything by stun or fear. No one can cc you and get away.
---
Im honestly just as excited for frosts videos as I am for classic. I could listen to him all day.
---
Fuck that place, I died like five times in a row trying to do Naga quest there and the nearest spirit was in middle of desolace.
---
Even died a few times to out of breath because I underestimated my swim speed
---
Nope. One person died. Rezzing would have been much faster than letting one person running. And not everyone does all quests they see.
---
WoW in the era of MeMes. What a time to be alive.
---
[Balanced War Axe](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13819)
---
3 plus months of 20 hour days every day. I played in a the best group on our server and didn’t need the gear. I only eventually got marshal for the speed bonus. We let our warriors mages and hunters get higher ranked to get their weapons first. 
---
I was looking forward to rolling a Druid to heal endgame until I watched some private server videos of Naxx guilds.  Most of the Horde side videos I saw didn't have a single Druid!  Are Druids really so suboptimal that endgame guilds would rather not take any onto Naxx. (At least Horde side)
---
Yup, the trick with them tho is not go insane during leveling. I got a second screen and a naga so I have a free hand. Ill be fine.
---
Shamans and Paladins don't use spirit, they use MP5/+healing, and spell crit for pallies. Both classes are spamming Chain Heal/Flash of Light while giving themselves MP5 via totems/blessings. 
---
&gt; All shaman/paladin tier gear has spirit on it
---
Pally don't use their tier gear for healing.
---
Shaman T1/T2 has spirit on it, but you want either full T1 or only 3-pc T2 for the increased chain heal. There are better offpieces.
---
T2.5 is for rets/eles and has every single stat on it, including strength and agility.
---
T3 has literally 0 spirit for both of those classes.
---
Sounds good to me. It's more than slightly annoying to be the most distant player from the instance and making the run to the instance, only upon getting there being asked by some lazy asshole in the next zone over "Can I have a summon?"
---
Mind providing an URL to that effect? I've looked at multiple vanilla sites and they all mention 3 minutes/3 minutes.
---
Tanaris at the bandits is a gankfest, and to a lesser extent Ogre cave
---
I dunno seems like a silly wording. Locks can kill tougher bosses than hunters they just dont have FD to quickly get to them.  Cheetah and FD is what makes hunters excell over locks for boss farming, not their ability to kill the toughest baddies.
---
We were able to get 4 rank 14 in the same week in my group. You have to basically be within a few HK of each other. Otherwise it's usually 2 without planning
---
I like the badlands too it’s a fantastic questing zone and I think I used a teleporter in Tanaris to get to the Badlands as a horde player.
---
I completely agree. If a group is doing their job right in a 5 man, group wide damage should be rare. Even rarer would be some odd group damage that single target heals couldn’t do easily. Depends on the competence of the group 
---
100% you have never played vanilla retail.
---
Enjoy being stuck in ZG
---
Hunters - Kill the pet. Only sleep or root it if you know for sure that they are NOT BM. Also, Viper Sting costs more mana for the Hunter to cast than it does for you to dispel (as long as you dispel before the first tick). It will run him OOM him much more quickly than it will you if you as long as you dispel it ASAP. If the Hunter is spamming Viper Sting, then end result is a net positive for the Druid (both of you wasted a GCD to apply/dispel, but he spent more mana).
---
Warlocks - You should not beat them in a fair 1v1 duel. But who does that? In the open world and group situations, Druids are an excellent counter to Warlocks. HoTs + curse dispels negate their damage almost entirely. And Feral has the ability to burst down Felhunters very quickly, which removes Soul Link and takes away their key utility (and also forces them to spend time summoning a new pet after they die).
---
Wut
---
Good stuff. I met some random guy with OCD and he couldn't logout if his gold was anything but even numbers, 20g, 00s, 00c, if he had 20g, 95s, 24c, he'd send me the difference.
---
If you are the type to sit semi afk in a major city spamming trade chat for long periods of time you can make some decent gold in tips. Early on some of the high end enchanting mats will likely be worth a fair amount of gold so farming blues to de can net solid income. Later on as the market gets saturated and demand plateaus those same blues are likely worth more to vendor than DE.
---
Oh yeah, I've heard about PvP raids wiping other PvP raids with a few people spamming Sappers. lol
---
You forgot an important spot! There’s a choke point to the west of Astranaar where the road stops going west and curves to the north. Lots of people go through there since there’s pretty much no other way back up from the beach.
---
Yeah, some people just cant get used to the mmo mice. I use a Razer mouse that can swap out that entire button plate, so I only use it while playing keybind heavy games. It's funny how when I use the normal attachment, I naturally rest my mouse straight ahead. When I use the mmo attachment, I rotate my mouse like 45° to the left in my hand, as it pretty much puts all twelve buttons perpendicular to my thumb. I've known a couple people that struggled using the buttons efficiently, but they just held it like a normal mouse. I would be lost without all my extra keybind slots. 
---
As a warlock the only 1v1 matchup where wotf is good is the mirror. However a good player will time their deathcoils and use addons to minimize any advantage you gain from it. The hardest matchup for a warlock is by far the rogue matchup. Every other class just crumbles to you. The orc stun racial is essentially a 25% chance to just auto win vs any rogue. OP.
---
As an avid arena player who is 2000-2500 expansion (and by now on every class but 2), I cant wait for classic. It won’t be competitively equal (tho it has great pvp class balance honestly), due to t not being arena but actual World pvp. You may think you know that term, but if you have only done it after vanilla, you haven’t had the true MMO RPG version of it. A vibrant and alive world is a marvel to pvp in.
---
Your time would go faster if u just summoned them anyway.
---
Imagine if you couldn't jump in wow at all, literally unplayable
