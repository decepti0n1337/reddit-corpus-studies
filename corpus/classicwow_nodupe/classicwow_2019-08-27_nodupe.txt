True, but walking with Elias feels pretty great too. We also totally have the best Hughes brother ;)

---
I thought you meant that you can fight in there, but they will just attack you once you leave. That would mean there are repercussions.
---
Sat in queue in Herod since 5pm est. I knew what I was getting into. Did other things while I waited. 6pm, only 15 min left. Randomly get d/c’d. Great, hop in queue; 15k people ahead of me. Drops down to 5.5k and timer sits at 15 min for almost 30 minutes. These are the people who *really* want to get in. I’m about 4 min left in queue, and now the storm has knocked out my power and my internet. Guess I won’t be playing today.
---
Yep, probably gonna call it a night and play tomorrow morning vOv
---
Herod queue is completely dead. Been 50th in queue for 45 minutes.
---
You are correct sir. Lol
---
I got in for about an hour till I was dc'd and now im in a queue that's been going for about half an hour or so
---
2532 for me on OCE
---
I didn't say you want raid finder, but if you want literally any improvement then you want something that in it's essence is NOT classic wow, which means you think you do, but you don't. I hope to see you in the upcoming Olympic Games finishing strong in mental gymnastics.
---
PLEASE...
---
I actually love the in que. Why? Nothing more nostalgia than that. They are giving us the worse first. In my humble opinion. Well still waiting....hopefully soon.
---
That's the stupidest thing, just move on... you're probably wasting 100x more time queuing in the game like that like a dork.
---
Just did.
---
I was the same but 29 or 30.
---
And this is why Im in the middle of a divorce and my friend just recently said, "im glad we're hanging out more again."
---
You checked all of them?
---
Got in at launch and had to change some UI stuff, now I'm stuck in the same position. God save us all.
---
What server is this?
---
You and me both..
---
wait at work, the wait time for most servers is like 4+ hours at least.
---
Brand spanking new at 1pm, full by 545. Only 5450 logins til I get my shot to log in. 
---

---
That’ll take me from 545-8 in q.
---
Can’t wait to see the shit show that awaits lol.
---
There’s a secret path..
---
damn.. 3 hours in queue and I got DC'd.
---
Kromcrush ftw.   15 min queue.
---
That's so fucked up. Streamers shouldn't leverage their power to create a mafia that can have such strong control over individuals like that.
---
It'll be up eventually, and fuck if I'm gonna get back in the queue after finally getting in the character select screen.
---
Just joined. 4480
---
Word spread quickly.
---
See, this doesn't help my skepticism seeing 2,351/21 minutes. What position are you?
---
Nah see estimated time remaining has been 5 minutes for the past 2 hours
---
Hmm maybe but definitely not the case for me, queue is still moving just as slow
---
There's no sound
---
incendius queue is ridic. Its barely moving. I got in at 5:40 EST at 7k ... two hours later im at 3200... wtf
---
what number are you at ? im 6400 with 207min wait time
---
Queue
---
I'll wear all red in town. I guess it's a start
---
here we go, the conspiracy theorist LOL
---
In que for Gehennas on EU server, been waiting for 1h and are 8346 people before me. Watching South Park and drinking coffee while waiting. When the que accually goes Up my spirit drop a bit, but will be worth it. Lets face it, who expected anything else at release day? Will be worth it!
---
Damn, I figured it would be bad
---
That’s a matter of personal opinion with no clear cut answer. 
---
Many of the people here will tell you Classic is better as that’s what we are all here for.
---
you have each other
---
https://imgflip.com/i/38yl1n
---
I am not sure those people are where that comes from but I guess it is possible.  I feel like you judging people how they want to spend their own earned vacation time is "less than stellar".
---
I heard from someone that they are currently playing on Pagle with no problems. Not sure why so many of us are getting the "World Server is Down" message.
---
How is this legal?
---
How many streams are of a login queue?
---
Currently rubbing my nipples against the keyboard. This game is so good. Sorry that some.of you can't play.
---
Beautiful
---
Didn’t you warn her? If so you gotta have a conversation man.  
---
She’s allowed to go to a movie right?
---
&gt; Then logged out to eat dinner
---
ouch man, I'm eating chips at my desk watching an infinity loop of loading screen and "Word Server is Down". I'm too afraid to leave the room and have to do the Queue
---
In the exact same boat as you.  Hoping these queues are cleared out by then.  Good luck to ya!
---
at 7.2k ahead of me. Been at 17mins for an hour, been in Q for two hours
---
/hug
---
could they just do a merge of 2 or more servers at that point?
---
Can confirm
---
Over a million people are trying to log into a handful of servers.  If layering was off I don't think you'd even see the world.
---
Hmmm, I starting to think coming into this two days late might be a true blessing in disguise indeed. 
---
Good luck everyone and stay sane... you'll get in eventually....
---
Maybe?
---
Same for me.....ugh
---
healer
---
10120. I was a bit late too the party haha
---
nailed it pretty much
---
True, but at least in that case the annoyance was, for me, that it happened in a single player game.
---
tRiGgErRed
---
It’s like 12 hours now
---
I’m at work. What are the queue times for OCE?
---
They told people to move servers they literally repeated many times this was going to happen.
---
And they'll forget about the long que launch in that same time.
---
I doubt I'll last more than a few weeks, but I'll pay 15 bucks for a couple weeks nostalgia any day.
---
&gt; yet somehow none of the major streamers have been affected.
---
Half of Method's streamers either can't log in or have been disconnected while playing, lol.  [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/method)
---
 Once you're into the re Once you're into the realm of high-digit queues, if you come home from work and you see that, what that basically means is, you're not playing the game tonight on this server.

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
lol XD
---
I was making really good progress over the first hour or so of the queue...went from 8000+ to 4000+ in about 20-30 minutes, then down into the 2000s, but around 2250 I hit a wall, and for the hour+ since then I've gotten to 2199.
---
I got on right at 6pm, got kicked off 45 minutes later, and now I'm in a 7,000 person queue and hour and a half later that hasn't moved more than 500 in that time.
---
I'm at work at the moment, so probably gonna struggle to get time in tonight.
---
That was my trusty set up for years.
---
Whatever calculation they use for estimated time sure bounces around a lot.
---
Most streamers probably entered realm the second game went live. That's how I got in
---
Love your 50 jerseys this year.
---
Sabres fan :)
---
I have it the other way round.  My wife just abandoned me so I have all the time in the world to sit in a WOW queue....whilst working on getting her back....Oh the joys of being a male....
---
Seriously though. Why couldn't they have made more realms or anticipated this?
---
Me2
---
Been in queue since 2:30 PST, it's almost 5:00 now. Still 1,335 in queue. I have to leave for class in about 40 minutes. I'd skip it, but it's the first day of the semester. Should be a short class, hopefully they'll only keep up for an hour or two to go over the syllabus and safety stuff since it's the first day. 
---
I'm going to have the roommate hit space every 25 minutes so it doesn't kick me. There's a high chance he'll screw it up. Wish me luck, folks.
---
it is an absolute shit show. the brand new server they launched at 1pm has a 10k (probably gonna be 4-5 hour que) and the brand new server they launched after they realized how bad the fucked up there player estimate has a 3k 45 minute que
---
They added 4 more us servers this afternoon? 
---
The crazy thing is this can’t be coming as a surprise...they have all the metrics to track...so why is this so borked?
---
Worst part about a queue isn’t the placement in the queue, it’s the estimated time...  30minutes is actually somewhere between 90 - 120 minutes.
---
Damn sad man 😕 unfortunately unless they add some new servers It won't be ANY better tomorrow...
---
Been sub 1k in queue since 6 pm. 
---
481 with "estimated" 15 minutes.
---
I was 3k at 5:36, now at 882
---
Very exciting times for Sabres fans. Hope you guys go far this year! Expansion bros :)
---
Mine has only watched random episodes here and there and has been bugging me to watch the entire thing with her. I haven't had the heart to tell her about this episode, or My Lunch. These 2 episodes broke me
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/qbMEvt2tl5flC/giphy.gif
---
Started around 5k about 25 minutes before launch. Currently at 1923 and it's saying 66 minutes. Doesn't seem to be moving very quickly.
---
3 is suppose to be closest vanilla graphics
---
I assume you missed step 1 for playing wow classic: kiss your wife’s ass the weeks leading up to it so you get 0 push back. 
---
I watched two kids solo 5 days last week and let her pick where we went for dinner the last two weekends! Now I’ve basically earned a week of higher than normal me time.
---
At 2137 for Skeram. Started at 30 minutes before launch at around 5000.
---
I'm at work sadly, queues are probably going to be even worse when I can finally start to play.
---
Yup same here. Logged in at 2:38 PST and sitting at 2,200.
---
834 now lmao
---
It's about talking to people who are in the que aswell, getting to know the players that will RP/play with you and exchange the guild concepts you have with each other. 
---
It's about being social.
---
I started at 12k about 90 minutes ago. Now it's telling me 5 hours.
---
I wouldn't have thought you could fuck up the re-release of a 15 years old game, but here we are.
---
I've been sitting on 63 minutes since 3:45 Pm, it's almost 7pm now..
---
I trained skinning and bought a skinning knife but it's not letting me skin any mobs that usually should be skinnable (wolves, bats, etc.).  Anyone else having this problem?
---
Grrrreat to meet yeh!
---
Yup. I picked the lowest pop server at the time too xD
---
having a problem logging back in after getting logged out
---
no queue but loading screen never loads
---
Only true NE stay in Darkshore.
---
I got in right away, got to level 5, did the Night Elf deathmarch to my friends in coldridge, and changed to windowed mode and my game crashed and now I cant log back in. F
---
My buddy showed me he was in queue, and I thought it launched tomorrow. Made it home about an hour after him and now 11k in queue :(
---
So did a lot of us that are now back in a Que.
---
I feel for you man but this is my ideal situation right now... Looking at at least 3 hours myself
---
No idea
---
5.5k for me, and the turnover rate is slowwwww. Looking like another 5 hours minimum for me.
---
Not if youre doing a STEM degree and takingg calc or orgo my good man......
---
finally got in now this is happening to me too
---
You would think they'd be able to have a smooth launch considering they've literally launched the same game already.
---
Got 2 german PvP servers and both together had 30k queue. Tell me on what german PvP server should we reroll?
---
You arent missing much besides server lag and being disconnected...just to wait in que all over again
---
They were all login into WoW way before servers were up, like I was. So they and I got to skip the queue since Blizzard missed up and didn't purge the people that were logged in.
---
I mean, the classic good bfa bad meme is a big circlejerk, but there's usually at least a few that have a level head in these threads. I don't think it would be downvoted, especially because the thread we're in is at the top
---
Maybe that means your server is experiencing low disconnect rates.
---
And if you want to PvP, go play Fortnite ffs. 
---
Or you could let people enjoy what they like, since no game would exist without RP like DND?
---
Can confirm. I'm now stuck in a weird rubber banding hell and can't even log out.
---
Halp.
---
It won’t be 15 minutes
---
What do you mean nothing to do?
---
Thanks for the responses!
---
I'm honestly not sure what I mean by "activities" either since I know very little about WoW, but in Destiny there are different things like strikes, Menagerie, forges, blind well, escalation protocol, dungeons, and raids, and only some of these have matchmaking (usually just the more casual stuff). I wasn't sure if there was something analogous in WoW, but it sounds like it's either solo stuff or difficult activities like dungeons that I'd want to find a premade group for anyway.
---
Anyway thanks again, seems like there's no reason for me not to at least give the game a shot now.
---
Got through the queue on Bloodsail Buccaneers only to get World Server is Down message. Realm Status webpage shows no issues but I am stuck at character screen, getting the same error. Sigh.
---
Don't be a dick to folks with obligations.
---
Might be able to store the current url in localstorage and update whenever the page is changed? Then check for it on page load. That's how I'd do it since I don't know anything about cookies
---
idk why everyone's whining about the accented character lmao. I've used a name with an accent in it for years with literally 0 problems.
---
As someone 10,432 in queue on a medium pop server with an estimated wait time of 189 minutes.... there are few things more accurate than this.
---
made the mistake of running into org to learn skinning and now world server is down. F
---
No, Faerilina is
---
went from 22 minutes (on that time for about 45 minutes) all the way up to 90 minutes...may as well go get my exercise while waiting lol
---
F
---
Go to your friend's house and unplug their PC.
---
Holy crap, lol, I don't remember it being *that* crowded before.
---
And handle name collisions how?
---
2336 in queue, and I'm still having second doubts of what to roll. Shaman or maybe warrior??
---
Loading screen got stuck at 90% and booted me to char selection saying world server is down. Is everyone experiencing this on Skeram?
---
[https://ibb.co/8PXdL9B](https://ibb.co/8PXdL9B) this game be trippin
---
Anyone in the Incedious? Is the server running fine once you get in?
---
Didn't work for me unfortunately..
---
A man can hope.
---
how to get through “World server is down” after character selection?
---
There's a couple low pop servers you can get in, but I'm afraid of committing a character to one.
---
Let me innnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!
---
They did the math.
---
This thing is awesome. Is it available in addon form somehow?
---
loving it got to lvl  3 with the lord Frageth, greatest mage in Bigglesworth
---
I wonder how many are people who play retail that plan to hop in for a few weeks before quitting.  I'm assuming the rate of people stopping playing will drop relatively substantially after a few weeks though.  I do think the server count is still low for where it'll eventually level off.
---
Technically it will be 15 minutes, several times
---
I joined later then that and I'm at 4051...
---
currently living in a sharehouse :) Feels like a true classic experience haha
---
Same. As soon as I entered Dun Morogh I basically disconnected and the world server has been down ever since. Oh well.
---
Same.
---
&gt;Does Blizzard think 90 percent of day-one players will quit? That's not going to happen.
---
Honestly, that has been my impression.
---
Wow what a joke .....
---
yes. all early players got logged off and the normies got in directly after.
---
Sitting pretty on 9k with 10hrs left apparently
---
Might have something to do with the thing I'm seeing here about Stormwind being bugged.  People might be logging out due to that kind of thing.
---
Same with Ironforge. Don't walk through the gates.
---
&gt;made the mistake of running into org to learn skinning and now world server is down. F
---
Same for me, but with all my chars it seems. What's going on?
---
they are also 30 times as large now retard
---
His name is Robert Paulson.
---
No F because you got playtime.
---
Im at 5.9k
---
trapped in orgrimmar....send help
---
You said that? You actually said .... (looks both ways) biiiiiiiiiitch?
---
two hours later, world server still down?
---
Are you aware that the dungeon finder was 100% Blizzard's doing?
---
Most realms are at like 350 minutes my friend
---
Plenty of us experienced something similar in 2004....it was many hours before most of us could log on back then and the servers were up and down like a rent boys underpants on New Years Eve.
---
Server pops are way higher than 3,000. They are more like 25k to 30k total.
---
It won’t let me leave. It keeps saying instance not found and then teleports me back to ironforge. This is on Grobbulus
---
I was ecstatic when classic wow was announced. A chance to go back and relive the excitement of my childhood. Not even being able to read while wandering around on my mage just killing boars and trying to figure it out. I was so excited I even subbed early to reserve the same name I had in vanilla, a very dumb name from a 6 year old who had his cousin help make back in 2005. Imagine my anger, my frustration, WHEN MY DUMBASS NAME IS RESERVED ON EVERY SINGLE SERVER FOR CLASSIC. I had the only instance of that name up until cata when I stopped checking. I dont know who you are. But I have a certain set of skills. I have farmed the crimson whelplings of the wetlands, I have slain the mighty gnoll hogger with my journeymans bowstaff, I have braved the depths of Onyxias lair. Now I come for you... prepare yourself.
---
2hours of this shit now ffs lmao
---
Hardcore mode, now that's a new concept for wow.
---
And how does he differentiate stream snipers, random ganks, and gank squads formed because he's well known and someone spotted him?
---
Unpopular opinion here but I honestly side with blizzard on this one.  But they probably should have mentioned emulators.  A lot of people play mobile games on PC through emulators like BlueStacks.  I personally do and there are some really good games out there.  I honestly think Diablo Immortal has the potential to be a good game.  People just assume mobile is trash when in 2019 it's really not.
---
5854 here, est wait 48 min. Been waiting ~25 minutes so far, not awful.
---
Wrong. Layering exists so that the game would be playable once you're actually playing
---
Same, and now I can't log back in.
---
internet went out for a minute, now I'm 23402 in queue :)
---
[removed]
---
I basically just tried the lowest pop pvp server and I have been stuck at 2000 for the past 2 hours.
---
Feeling like trying to game tonight is pointless.
---
I think  they need two more PvE and two more PvP, frankly.  I know there's a concern about what happens in 6 months, but lets have a better launch here.
---
lmao, now this is the right attitude!
---
Played from zero hour to hour 1 now I'm commuting... 9hours to go and then probably a queue
---
Thanks so much! :D Hope you have lots of fun in Classic!
---
Probably so many people that the server won't let any npc actions happen
---
There are, they added them too late though, and people aren’t willing to move.
---
Whitemane: an hour ago, 10k in queue, 3-4 hour estimated wait.  Now, 8k in queue, 21 minute estimated wait.  Something's fucky...
---
Can someone please help me? I am experiencing "stuttering" and extremely frustrating lag and I have no idea how to fix it.
---
switch server? you mean realm?
---
Nope. They lie. From 4k downwards it takes like 1 hour per 500.
---
Well that’s why it says estimated - it means virtually nothing. I have no idea what they base it on, but clearly knowing when people will DC is impossible.
---
So my Character name is the same as my username...
---
Guy invites me into a party to kill mountain cougars...
---
His username?  Powerbottom
---
I was getting "world server is down" at character selection and I just kept trying. Just got in after around 10 mins.
---
Take a video or screen shot because that sounds cool
---
Same issue on Zandalar Tribe in Ironforge
---
&gt;we advise you go to less populated servers
---
Ok, but those are also full, what now?
---
&gt;duh er.. it was planned all along!
---
The disconnects and ultra laggy servers are the problem, not the queues
---
I’m at 650 and I got home at 6:00 and logged on. Just a fucking joke I picked the wrong server and got fucked for it
---
Finally under 5k. I'm hoping to at least get in two hours of game time today. Probably won't get on till at least 10ish.
---
FFXIV is proof that there are good casual MMORPGs in addition to bad MMORPGs like modern WoW.
---
should be 20 but theyll probably make 5
---
Can anybody confirm what the current population of Kromcrush is? Is it high yet?
---
.... I don't know how there programming works but this is more likely a money problem.  They are not wanting to spend a penny more than they have to.  They know how much pain we will tolerate.
---
You all waiting in queue to get into a server well I'm over here can't even get the game to update or submit a web ticket without getting an error
---
Ironforge on an RP realm, totally uncrowded. No lag, no queue. Definitely recommend rolling a Dwarf!
---
must be nice
---
this is like error 37 all over again
---
lvl 6 dwarf hunter :( ... but hey we should have exptected something like this
---
So polite! LOL
---
\#14335 reporting in :\*(
---
Did you get in yet? The estimated times on these things are so off.
---
Disable discord in game overlay mate, fixed the issue for me.
---
In que atm but, as a lvl 1 night elf that will be trying to go to elwynn forest, does the flight master cost money that I don't have?
---
Glad i rolled here, terrible name but it's actually pretty usable now. First 30 minutes or so was constant hilarity of being disconnected from chat server and crazy lag. Seems like other people are still waiting to get in for the first time on their servers.
---
Look at the people in front of you, don't look at the estimated time.
---
People are so naive to think that this is some sort of "conspiracy theory" when any sane company that values their money would, indeed, try to find ways to make the streamer experience as sweet and nice as possible.
---
It's extremely cheap publicity. And good publicity is usually very expensive.
---
I plan to play alliance rogue as well what race are you? Ill be night elf allaince rogue theyre rare.
---
I jumped in at \~22k with 750+min wait. Now 19k and 53mins. Though its been 53 mins for \~10 mins now haha
---
Whitemane 22k queue 59 mins checking in
---
LET ME IN, LET ME INNNNNN!!!
---
I love their folk music
---
I'm currently at 9 min queue (yes 9) with 7700 people in front of me. I started with 69 min and 13k nearly 2hrs ago
---
Transfer Aborted: instance not found
---
Gotta pic? That's awesome
---
Been in que for 3 hours and went from 2k to 1k
---
IIRC there should be a tooltip on the Minimap for it.
---
Does anyone know what Shazzrah is like?
---
Literally every server has at least 5000 in queue, some are over 10-15000.
---
My only real concern would actually be more about them keeping with WoW's art style and not going fucking crazy with shaders like all modern games seem to do. 
---
Everything ends up with a weird sheen and a glow that looks like crap. I just wanna look at some really high quality textures on higher poly models.
---
After 3 hours in queue, I'm in triple digits to go.
---
7 years ago when i started in the pserver scene this was a pipe dream. No one ever believed Blizzard would actually give us what we wanted. I might have put years in on the pserver scene - but lets be real. Nostralius got this for us. Prior to them getting shut down Blizzard had zero cares to give about vanilla or other xpacs. I regret never playing there, but the true heroes are the nost staff.
---
You realize this is an mmoRPG right?
---
Spam enter world
---
Find me a PVP server in the east coast with under an hour queue, and your argument might be valid. They dropped the ball on this hard.
---
I wanna be the old guy shaking his hand up and down rapidly under a trench coat.
---
Pagle is showing as Medium population, but i'm 9.9K in queue at the moment
---
The irony is palpable. trust no one, not even yourself.
---
Yeah I'll prolly be able to log in by 2020.
---
Maybe I'm probably just triggered.  I deal with a lot of elitism among PC gamers that mobile games aren't real games when they can honestly be quite good and with emulators play similarly to a lot of PC games if you really want that control scheme.
---
u dont have any flight paths unlocked anyway...you will have to walk it
---
Hey guys I could definitely use ur input. I originally planned on putting my main on alliance Faerlina because I love community events and wanna be on the server where everything happens. Recently, my friend has been telling me to play with him on Herod alliance but I'm not so sure if I should. I want to roll an alliance character and a horde one, but will be probably prioritizing my alliance character. I haven't managed to get into Faerlina but am getting close after being queued for 3 hours. I normally wouldn't swap but Faerlina has such a good horde population too so idk. What do you guys think?
---
Wow is this a legit new official advertisement for Classic? 
---
That was actually awesome, great song. Cool!
---
Yep.   So many losers are going to leave....
---
Spamming "Please can I have your gear" for a few weeks could be a viable gold making strategy.   
---
Level later when the pickings are slimmer.
---
Total of five new servers (3 more just came online a couple minutes ago)
---
```Ashkandi - Normal - Eastern```
---
```Kirtonos - PvP Eastern```
---
```Kromcrush – PvP – Eastern```
---
```Kurinnaxx – PvP - Pacific```
---
```Rattlegore - PvP - Pacific```
---
Can 3721 of you go to bed please?
---
Oh it was toast the second it was announced.
---
I want to make sure I get my licks in on the fucking shitty ass """cinematic""" focus that games have made the absolutely massive mistake of prioritizing now that we have to graphics to do it. It makes it feel like game devs are just hollywood rejects. Nobody buys a video game to watch a shitty cutscene movie.
---
Games will never be anywhere near as good as movies AT being movies, so it boggles my fucking mind that so many idiotic devs think that's the way forward.
---
You'd have been better off taking next week off. Maybe by then the servers will stabilize.
---
Can't wait for the first compilation of Sodapoppin getting ABSOLUTELY GAPED by ganksquads and slowing down  his 60 progress
---
423 streamers cut in line
---
you got into character select at 3996?
---
Hilarious.
---
Every single server is full with 20k+ queues.  If your not in now, you're not getting in tonight.
---
Shazzrah has about a 20k queue, but when you finally get done with the queue, you can't login because ''World Server is down''. I waited 3 hours for this.
---
Same
---
Waited through the long queue to be met by “world server is down” on Westfall.  Been doing this for 10 minutes
---
Yep - same boat..
---
that's human diplomacy right there!
---
Was getting 'World Server Down' on Bloodsail Buccaneers. Creating a new character didn't work but I went to the realm list select screen, selected Bloodsail again and the next login after that worked.
---
Had no trouble logging and re-logging on Blaumeux for the first 45 minutes.
---
Logged off to drive home...
---
Now I'm 10,000th in queue.
---
Yeah, but roughly 50% of those are the opposing faction.... so.... fuck yeah!
---
How can people be complaining about being unable to play a game they're paying money to play? You serious?
---
sort of surprised they were so quick with krom but havent added any since
---
Ah okay I can only see EU where there's two low pop PVP severs where u can log straight on to just no one wants to play them I guess.
---
Can you install classic on its own? I guess the actual size of classic is way smaller than full 70GB
---
which server is the best on EUW?
---
komkrush dc'd... queue is only at 500 right now
---
How is the queue time for Grob? Does anyone know atm?
---
you can't fly to a place you haven't been yet
---
if you just mean getting off the island, the boat is free to Darkshore
---
Spamming now, will report back if successful.
---
Yeah, I followed the 30 min before launch advice and I got fucked.
---
I'm getting instant world server is down. I've clicked enter world about 150 times so far.. Is this broken? Server Kromcrush
---
Which is increasing for me?
---
Question, did they update all the graphics and models with classic or is it literally classic?
---
There's an 11000 person queue now!? I'm #6400 currently. There wasn't even a queue when I got on when the game went live :/
---
Yeah, when I was a college kid with like 12 hours of class a week this was a different beast. I have at most 3 hours an evening to myself, I can't really wait in queues like this.
---
Towns not larger than 500 people have gbit internet in Iceland.
---
Pagle is still down.. I waited. Got DC'd. Waited and saw it was still down and said fuck it for tonight..
---
Three new realms just opened in NA: Ashkandi, Kirtonos, and Rattlegore. I got right into Kirtonos
---
I wish we would get a bit more communication from blizzard.
---
NEW SERVERS WE IN BOIS
---
RIP me on stalaag queue... this is dumb
---
That's me....right now....an hour later..... omfg
---
Yeah it’s only like 3.5gb. There’s a drop down on the battlenet launcher
---
And yet they claim we don’t need more servers.
---
[they've managed to form an actual queue on Blameux](https://imgur.com/a/KDAgfFJ)
---
You are a hero
---
10 hour + queues is a bit over the top, though.
---
My queue was at 295 minutes. I left and re-entered and got in instantly.
---
I have been in q since one hour before launch. PC froze while playing BFV simultaneously and when logged back into wow classic it put me back in the same spot I was in before my pc crashed.
---
Welcome to vanilla, I hope you will enjoy it as we did!
---
Faerlina had a 20k queue. 2.5 hours in and I'm only down to 10k.
---
"Our service is predictably shit, so you should just accept it" seems kind of an odd line of logic.
---
I'm at 506 now,  4 min estimated time.
---
Anyone get in for Kromcrush?
---
Don’t base it on server queues right now. Play the long game. If you are into the streamer stuff you will be disappointed not playing on that server. Think about yourself. You can always roll a character with your friend but sounds like you’d be sad if you weren’t on faerlina.
---
I remember. And i think error 37 was worse. For now at least. I mean. I think some chinese guys managed to complete teh game before most people even manage to log in
---
20k here, 150 min eta
---
Like the new server that wasn't supposed to have queus?
---
Got 2.5 hours in before I’ve had to call it a night. I got straight in at 11pm and Northshire Abbey was swarming! Had to scrap and corpse camp kobolds for 30 mins just to finish the first quest absolutely exhilarating stuff. Going to let myself fall behind the curve because I can’t keep playing like that. Feels good to be home!
---
I've been @ 570 for 25 minutes now, so yeah !
---
Those eyes look a little too uncomfortably like soulstones.
---
Been queued for almost 2 hours and still have 101 minutes and 15254 players in my way...
---
Ive coordinated like 60 people there and its unplayable. You finally get through the que and you either dc or server goes down putting you at the front of the que, its happened twice to me now
---
Sure, the reason is super obvious.  But most conspiracy theories have some kind of pretty good reason why someone would want it that way.  In this case you can simply see the results of it with your eyes, pretty frequently.  It's not exactly Area 51 in this bitch.  You can just open a link and see for yourself, in this situation and many others.
---
lol what a noob
---
Same thing happened to me, I gave up for the night. If this same shit happens again ill probably just have to reroll on a low pop server
---
have someone queue for you
---
Probably closer to 45 hours than minutes.
---
Jeez. This is Insane. I'll play later I guess =)
---
Tried selecting the realm again, restarting and login into another character. Nothing worked ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yea I just tried it too, however I still get world server down
---
Think they'll have to do a merge later?
---
Maybe!  I still don't regret it though.
---
Should I play in a high pop server and just accept that I'll have to wait or should I play a low pop server? Is there a major difference?
---
BS: Too many females in this video.
---
Agreed, lots of industries have outdated curriculum that in the end is interesting, but not at all helpful for when you start working.
---
Ashkandi - Normal - Eastern
---
Kirtonos - PVP - Eastern 
---
Rattlegore - PVP - Pacific
---
Do what you want man, its an amazing game and making friends is what its all about. Sure you 'can' solo but its not nearly as fun(imo) or efficient especially as a newbie. Give all the professions a try before making a decision as you can only have 2 primary and it sucks getting them high and realizing you dont need them or want a new one. Do what is fun for you and if your confused, ask questions, by god ask questions. Someone will help you. And maybe one day, you will be the person helping out a brand new player too, its the circle of life.
---
HEHEHE PILE ON!!!!
---
It’s a meme but I’m pretty sure he actually did that lol
---
So I was in que, 12k left. Went to the store.. came back and my account was logged out? Any reason why the game auto logs me out?
---
[here u go](https://i.imgur.com/OpSmyZ6.png)
---
😭😭
---
My exact experience.
---
Northshire Abbey was terrible. Elwynn was great, but then I tried to enter Stormwind and was booted within 30 sec.
---
Its been saying mu position in queue is 32 for about 10 minutes now. I started at nearly 9900 people but at exactly 32 its just stopped?
---
What are the eastern pvp servers again?
---
Connected at 17h40. I'm at 7700, started at 12k. Good luck friend.
---
they had transfers in classic wow, i'm sure they'll add them again once this phase is over
---
Don't know if it's because it's RP or because it's a lot of British people. Reputation does matter however so you don't want to burn your bridges in the first hours on the server.
---
Yeah sure. Enjoy world server down! :(
---
People are leaving the queue and then getting back in. If you dc, you're given like a minute grace period to re-enter the queue back at at your previous spot.
---
I'm on stalag and I'm at 10800. Started at 20k. It's always going down but I bet it's mostly people leaving the Q
---
Yep!! Just waited 3 hours for the world server to be down
---
Even now it fills me with rage.
---
Iirc you can basically grind past a huge amount of the starter quests and it doesn't really start to matter until the dungeon quests for SM and WC.
---
Maybe on your server. 
---
My server prices have skyrocketed.
---
It’s not getting any better once through the queue. Been at the character screen for 20 minutes with “world server is down” error.
---
Two servers you can log straight in there just low pop at the moment
---
3 hours? Game launched 2.5 hours ago?
---
2080, i9 9900K. Honestly should just sell this rig knowing I won’t be playing anything else until Cyberpunk.
---
Ouch, hope you weren't on one of the servers with a 20k+ queue
---
the coasts of the US are absolutely packed, there's no reason other than greed
---
Feel your pain man
---
Warlocks get a free mount at 49 FYI :)
---
Been 4.9k for 3 Hours bud. We ain't playing on Fairbanks today.
---
as a night elf you're gonna have to go on "the run"
---
Been stuck at position #49 in queue on Bigglesworth for about 20 mins. anyone else?
---
Same :(
---
Why do they even have a rank 14 if it’s near impossible to get?
---
Did it going the other way with a human.
---
Nope and still in Queue.
---
Anyone tried to logout of a character and get to another? I'm afraid to try it lol
---
I'm on a low pop server but that's because mine is completely down.
---
I was in the first wave of players into Shazz EU. 
---
It was shit, and then I got kicked 40 minutes into it and ended up at the back of the 18k queue. Good times!
---
you're missing out! The waiting in queue screens are super nice!
---
simple/stupid question: I thought the launch was 8/27.. how is everyone playing already?
---
Same here, never lucky
---
LOL. When I played on the stress test there weren't even any mobs to grind. Everything was dead. Even the bunnies were dead.
---
This was my que logging in 23:55 on Firemaw EU
---
https://imgur.com/a/Rk2md7S
---
Netherless to say im going to bed
---
I’ve been at roughly 6k for the last hour. Timer is at 300 mins. I’m calling it for the night.
---
lol you're not miasing out with the server crashes and queues.
---
Yeah people are getting in!
---
So why did the mods shut the entire subreddit down on the launch day that people have been waiting for for 2 years?
---
I got past queue and getting world server down, anyone get past that?
---
I got down to 3k and then was dropped. Couldn't connect for like 15min and joined back at 18k. that was 2 hours ago. I'm at 13k now
---
Not the guy who posted but I was able to get in Herod in the initial rush, then Herod died and I got stuck on retrieving realm list while everyone else I was leveling with passed right through that. Been in queue for a couple hours now with a couple more to go.
---
Hit Select Realm select your own realm again. That's confirmed working for a bunch of people.
---

---
Confirmed worked for a friend of mine in guild who was stuck at world server down on Incendius for a good 15 or 20 minutes.
---
Same here not like we won’t catch up!
---
Same boat here. Im about to just sleep.
---
will be globally available then
---
They're all high pop at this point, you'll probably be fine with any server.  Only exception would be if you wanted to join a previously established guild.
---
Am now 4.1k after 3 hours. says 189 minutes. I don't believe any of it.
---
Streamers are not canon to classic, gotta cleanse the servers NOCHANGES
---
I'm at 27 and wondering there the last 5 went. It's going fast and accelerating and I'm scared.
---
IS there anywhere you can keep track of whos leading the race to 60?
---
New servers! Pvpers please go noggenfogger &lt;3
---
IKR It had me down to a 16 minute timer on Herod after the crash. Now I've been sitting at over 100 minutes for the last 40ish minutes...
---
In the same boat bud
---
lol joined a new server the first thing I see in the cinematic is someone yelling PEE PEE POO POO covering my screen in their dialog box
---
Same, very cool
---
GOTEEM
---
Does anyone know why there isn't even a version option on Battle.Net?
---
yeap this is fucked, i was logged since the beginning, server randomly crashes and now im stuck in a 5k queue, strangely enough the streamer server hasnt crashed once
---
That's the way.
---
Annnnnd were back
---
8/27 GMT time
---
I'm already level 8.
---
They shut it down the minute it launched, they want to play, not moderate.
---
Got into Rattlegore right away! Thanks!
---
lol it came true.
---
Probably because they have been waiting 2 years as well and dont want to deal with the cesspool of launch posts.
---
Rattlegore! No queue time to get on
---
Do YOU want to moderate all the posts that morons would be making? They shut it down for 3 hours and funneled all posts into stickies
---
I was one of the unlucky ones. Got into Gehennas. Servers were unplayable. Got disconnected, 120 min queue and longer..... Moved to Noggenfogger now, and am actually enjoying the game! Unfortunately the login server is down now :(
---
My friend managed to get in Mograine pretty early, played for 45 mins or so and DCd, as he DCd my queue suddenly went from 3k to 800 and a few seconds later I got in. Managed to get to lvl 7 in 1 hour and logged off for the night now
---
which ones and which coats are they?
---
Queue of 25789 on Herod.  Might be able to play by midnight!!
---
I'm standing at 3k, logged at 6est
---
Nearing 2.5 hours here.  Started mid 14ks, now \~8800.  So just over 3k/hr for Skeram.    
---
Can only imagine how nutty it would have been if I stayed on Herod.
---
¿¿¿qué???
---
It blows my mind at the number of people complaining about this.
---
undead
---
Sorry you have no life.
---
Don't say that, I've been in the queue for almost 2 hours on Golemag and now I'm starting to doubt whether I'll actually be logged in once I reach 1 in the queue.
---
I couldn't get on the realm my friends and I all preloaded toons on because Comcast tanked on me when I was near 10 minutes after waiting for 45. Jumped on normal realm and the start area was complete chaos. Still fun.
---
Cringe title bro.
---
Yeah, I think that poor guy was just upset to be presenting a game that people turned out not to be excited about and didn't know how to respond. They probably all talked him up saying, "It's a Blizzard game! Everyone loves our games. You'll do great!"
---
I actually feel sad. Revealing a Blizzard game should be an honor.
---
They literally only scrapped a multi million dollar and years long dev cycle of what was gonna be what blizz wanted wow2 to be a few years ago, that idea is well and truly dead. Somehow it ended up spawning Overwatch due to whatever happened to Titan it ended up with assets and mechahicsn tailored towards a moba more then anything.
---
2019 blizz cant be trusted to make a WoW 2 ignoring the fact it literally wont be anywhs.
---
They ain't joking i'm afraid
---
Is it verb and noun?
---
Vanilla servers had 5k pop TOTAL. There's 4x that many just stuck in login queue on what are mega pop servers compared to vanilla because of layering. 
---
So much for #nochanges
---
I'm calling it. Layering won't be removed for at least 6 months.  Blizzard will blame it on the game being too popular.
---
that's the smallest surprise of the day
---
You sit in 3 because you are late to the party, thats how queueus are supposed to work. Once you are in you shouldnt be booted out to the back due to a failure on their end
---
\&gt; MGS 4 absolutely, one of the worst examples    
---
We're just going to have to settle on "different people have different tastes"  
---
MGS4 had 8+ hours of cinematics and I loved every. second. of it.  
---
I agree with your sentiment, but there is certainly a market for "cinematic games".   
---
I would argue a good way to put it is "cinematics don't make the game, gameplay makes the game, and the industry forgot that"
---
Eventually money becomes less of an issue.  It's still painful but generally the guide will help with the costs.
---
I’ve played Old school RuneScape and even RuneScape back before all the new stuff, is it that big of a grind? (If you know what RuneScape is lol)
---
Well this is classic wow, it takes over an hour anyway to get out the starter zone
---
A friend of mine got straight in to a server whilst I'm ploughing through a 6k queue
---
been on Whitemane queue since 4:30 CST 6800 to 1233 3+ hours wait almost there
---
12k on Arugal.
---
Do queues count as unplayed time?
---
How long are the long ques expected to last? A few days? Or permanent untill server transfers?
---
Saltyyyyyyy
---
RIP Rattlegore???
---
Blizzard knows best :)    
---
Leaving new servers at the last minute after guilds/friends already decided on a server was a good idea :)    
---
:)
---
Rattlegore down
---
seems odd that the queue position was moving nice and fast and then suddenly FROZE ENTIRELY for 20 mins at 190..
---
My first main was a Warrior, and it was awesome. I ended up being one of the main tanks for a semi casual raiding guild by the end of Vanilla. I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
There's permanently 30-40 people, grouped up, competing. Just missed it again lol.
---
So is your moms box.
---
crashed, rattlegore.
---
&gt;There's an 11000 person queue now!? I'm #6400 currently. There wasn't even a queue when I got on when the game went live :/
---
at 6:15pm EST i logged in and queued up to 14K. im now at 5099 in line at 8:51pm
---
None of us are going to play on stalagg for another 12 hours.
---
30 min early to skeram and went from 6.5k to 1.4k
---
"How do I get to Ironforge?"
---
"Literally just kill yourself"
---
"Wow, thanks for nothing, asshole"
---
i am approaching a 3 hour queue on a brand new realm. queued since 20 minutes before Live, Incendius.
---
no shit. i think my 0-60 was like 46 played days. 
---
back when gear didn't mean near as much as skill.
---
Rattlegore and Kirtonos
---
Remulos represent.
---
I got disconnected 2 hours ago and haven't been able to get on since with world down. Wondering if anybody in the EU is actually playing, I have no idea because the subreddit was shut down.
---
Yeah I was in no problem, server crashes and have been in queue since. Only down to 7400 people... Not playing anymore tonight I'd think.
---
Are they posting about this?
---
Lol, hell no. When the traffic is low you can leave within 30 minutes easily.
---
I’m at 7700 I’ve been in que since 5:25
---
Meme of the year award candidate
---
I started at 18,000 give or take, I'm at 16,000 now
---
Woah, my queue jumped almost 1k in a minute
---
yep! all 3 other people I was leveling with didn't get stuck on retrieving realm list after Herod crashed, obviously can't expect them to wait for me for 4+ hours. So went from having fun leveling with friends to probably solo leveling to 60. Feels alright
---
Kilgore from Undermine... if you’re out there, hit me up.
---
Your pal, lmaonade.
---
What position? Stay strong
---
That is because of all the phasing/sharding BS.
---
/who x-y
---
How is it entitled to expect to not have to go to the back of a line I allready went through when it's completely out of my hands that I got DCed?
---
UGHHHH
---
You know who else signed up early and reserved a name? Everyone else. Grow up.
---
Incendius.
---
I logged on and had three characters created by 1:05. And then just fucked it all straight to hell.
---
Nothing about vanilla is or was difficult you’re vastly over exaggerating the literal 2-7 mechanics every enemy in the game has
---
I knew there would be, the point is there shouldn't.
---
Then you just offer server migrations from low pop servers into higher pop servers. The key is to get everyone in to the game right now and get them hooked. Worry about low pop later and just transfer them.
---
wrong but okay
---
I’ve moved up 7k spots in 2 hours so i don’t think it’ll take 45 lol but i do know the 45 minute queue time was not even close to realistic which is why i posted it
---
I logged in at 545ish to no queue. Then my router decided to get hung around level 5, so I had to requeue...
---
Man, now that I think of it... I'm glad Classic isn't locked behind some rep/achievement wall.
---
Fuckk
---
Ohhh my bad
---
Im so mad, I was in and playing arugal on launch but I left because I never thought we'd even get a queue and i could just hop on later, let alone this. 
---
Atleast we're gonna have a nice juicy australian server with a bunch of people, i'd rather this than it be empty here.
---
Think it's worth moving completely to the brand new servers they just put out?
---
I wish ashkandi was pvp so badly :((
---
I know, I was actually having fun for about 5 minutes
---
Also in queue for OCE PvP server. Makes no sense why there's only one.
---
wow isn't as big of a grind as RS, but there are some niche grinds in wow that can be as bad as some grinds in RS.
---
classic wow is to wow as OSRS is to RS3.
---
OSRS had a super smooth launch too
---
Yea.
---
Roll an orc hunter and go get an owl at level 10 from Darnassus. I did that pain and it was totally worth it
---
I bought a subscription about half an hour ago but I'm still not getting the option to change my version. Is there something else I should do or just wait for a while longer?
---
I got on to Mankrik at pretty much launch time, maybe 5-10 past. It was beyond laggy so I dipped.
---
Half hour later I got in a queue. Still got a hour left.
---
it makes me sad because one of my old homies was in aussie playing US servers.
---
Queues slowing down for anyone else? 6000 &gt; 2000 took around 20 minutes. Now it has been another 30 minutes or so from 2000 &gt; 1500  (Atiesh).
---
It's an odd amount of entitlement. Like I get it, you paid for a game. You'll probably have ques for a little. But it's huge, and they're adding servers hourly. Server size isn't this magical thing they can increase instantly, it exists for a reason.
---
If you are paying a subscription it's not free you're literally paying for access.
---
I've been in queue for almost 2 and a half hours, currently sitting at 187 minutes.
---
this worked for me. tyty very much
---
Been in queue for 2.5 hours and I’m at 7400 lol
---
What servers are west coast?
---
Says he who played 250 days of wow kek
---
"WoW is dead"
---
Nope, got free time from other launches when the service was poor.
---
At this point, I just want to play. I’ll only play a few hours and let the dust settle tomorrow, see what my Stalagg realm looks like for que times. 
---
Blizzard will make several announcements concerns these realms by end of week.
---
Shout out to Blizzard customer support team.
---
Going to be a rough couple of days for them........
---
left the queue i'd been in for 2.5 hrs for rattlegore, got to lvl 2 and then the server crashed
---
Got to level 7 on my big boi tauren, I think I'll get some sleep now. General chat on Mirage Raceway was rather pleasant. Speedwagon signing off!
---
The record is 7 days played to 60.  Most will take between 10-20 days played.  It's not nearly as slow as runescape or EQ.
---
Dearest Mother, 
---
It has been almost 4 hours in queue. Food supplies running low. Spirits are still high though. The hope of going home keeps the men going in these trying times. I hope my next letter brings news of better fortune.
---
-BSG
---
Anyone else been in queue for Whitemane since 3 PM PST?
---
Means no one is getting in
---
For anyone late to the party like me, I got in fairly quickly on Kirtonos - PVP (NA east) 
---
What do people think about these new realms coming up, are they going to have a decent long term population?
---
kyew
---
Doesn't work.
---
Lol what if your q position graph just becomes a parabola
---
Here's a kicker for you mate - I haven't subbed.
---
I'll log on tonight, sub, and Bob's my uncle away I go.
---
There's a vast difference in perception here. You're absolutely delusional if you think you can line up a hundred thousand people to press a button and everyone of them log in instantly without issues or delays.
---
It's completely reasonable to have queue times and have delays, be mature about it and wait patiently Or do something else with your time and your hard valued $20M.
---
Go to the movies and wait for the adverts to start and pay more for the movies than you would for this cheap sub. Least then you can bitch about it to a different crowd.
---
is going to take*
---
Been in queue 4 hours, still got 1100 places to go, and at its current rate that's at least 2 hours. The queue on my server has gone as high as 25,000 (I started at 8,500).
---
rip

---
Guess I'm playing tomorrow! (stalagg)
---
 But you miss out on, er, *Googles it*, blackfathom depths!
---
You probably right, let's just focus on Blizzard then.
---
2004 Blizzard good.
---
2019 Blizzard/Activision baaaaaad.
---
Risky Click
---
This Queue is definitely the hardest boss fight I've played in years.
---
Literally none or else he would have linked it. Plus, apparently that's not how layers work (I know nothing, that is second hand info).
---
Pve or PvP?
---
Hahaha im going to sleep now and pray the fixed this shit by tomorrow morning
---
There is a grace period of you close out on your own. I loaded addons twice and got in without queueing
---
rattlegore had a 5 min queue for me
---
NA is like 500,000 people doing the same quest
---
New oceanic server, Yojamba is out bois. Keep crashing on the loading screen though :(
---
Silence! You pathetic gnome
---
That’s my concern as well
---
The best part of being a condescending dickhead is he was too stupid to even know by that point already, private vanilla servers were exploding. Literally over a hundred thousand people trying to fucking dog pile into the server.  
---
Yeah none of us want a vanilla experience you stupid donut. We're all just playing this jank private server by absolute random chance that has nothing to do with desire to play a non-shit version of the game you ruined.  
---
Man how out of touch can you be.
---
Monitoring server performance / reading &amp; investigating bug reports. The main reason for the ‘war room’ is so that they can directly communicate with each other
---
What are the Herod queue times like right now?
---
I’m not sure but 5 minutes later they were all KS my level 1-2 farming. Lol.
---
It's one day you sweaty ape
---
Because it’s launch day.......
---
Hell yeah, Kirtonos all the way.
---
Im not what exactly fixed it but I have the option now. 
---
When the download for the full game reached 1% it became playable, I started the game and first made a Wow account... my session timed out in the launcher and when I signed back in it now had the option to install classic on its own.
---
That's fair. It's probably for the best that it's not showing up.
---
Whitemane, I will be there soon....
---
Everything's fucked.
---
Here's a solution:
---
For every server, it's now two servers. The name pool between each of these pairs of servers is shared, but they will be separate on launch. After the hype dies down, merge the servers.
---
That'll be $10,000 Blizzard.
---
yeah this was kinda bullshit move for sure...
---
Shoutout to everyone in the Skeram queue who thought they were gonna avoid a wait by switching from Herod.
---
You've got balls dude. I'm not gonna risk it once I get in I'll prolly have waited like 6-7 hours.
---

---
That’s just time it estimated to me, a lot of people have been saying they’re all over the place.
---
anyone still in queue ha ha
---
Reading about entitled people getting really salty about the queues make me happy.
---
It is 9:11PM EST as I write this, I have been in queue since 5:40PM EST. 
---
On Incindeus .. started at 9,500 in queue, now at 2,200 with 115 minute wait. 
---
For reference, it has said anywhere from 40-80min wait for the past 3 hours.
---
That was EU for the first hour or so, it's a lot quieter now. Its 2am in the UK,  a lot of people have fucked it off and gone to bed.
---
Been in queue for 2 hours (5:15pm central) and still have another 6 hours to go. What the fuck.
---
Thats legit no reason at all ... just a fucking lame as excuse
---
They just released another pvp realm for OCE.
---
Are people actually crashing as they enter Stormwind and being tossed to the back of the queue? Or is that just a troll?
---
Been in Skeram queue for 3 and half hours, have 5 hours left on the estimated queue time. Very nice.
---
Expect anything less?
---
I'm gonna assume that's a larger issue with the servers right now than anything. That's now how it's supposed to work.
---
Sitting in queue for 10 hours :(
---
Pagle for me is sitting at around 6.5k, but my time is jumping wildly. I'm talking from 5 minutes to 85 minutes. Is anyone else running into this?
---
No there is apparently a grace period if you DC
---
Hunter is one of the more engaging specs to play in raids. Not only for their various jobs that don't involve damage but also the rotational part. It's not particular hard or complete (what class is?) but has more ways to be bad and a much more active playstyle than just pressing one single spell, compared to other ranged classes.
---
Me too hopefully! ;(
---
Should have logged in early lmao, not that hard. You deserve it. If they add too many realms it's worse in the long run, they're totally in the right.
---
Pissed and complaining aren't the same thing bro. But you do you. Hope you enjoy your que.
---
Based on the responses I’m getting this seems to be the case for sure.
---
Updated the main post https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxf1lc/aux_auction_house_addon_experimental_classic/
---
the price database is not needed with the new api
---
Grobbulus: 8851 and it says &lt; 1 minute hahahahahaha
---
This isn't worth it whatsoever, I fully expected top have to wait in queue, I didn't expect something to this magnitude, and I'm sitting here watching Asmon and crew have fun while sitting here for 4 hours. I just feel like a fucking idiot, I went from 14k to 7k in fairlina and I'm thinking of calling it quits, this is so shit, I really hope it's better tomorrow.
---
I’m on the downward side of my 30s, 2 kids and a crazy job. I had to quit right around the start of Cata and swore I’d never pick it up again. Vanilla has me coming back and planning to play an hour here or there just because. Nostalgia? Most definitely. Not just the game but because it reminds me of an “easier” time in life. Where I literally could raid 5+ hours a night and spend weekends leveling alts or whatever the hell else I wanted. I have lifelong friends I made along the way and we’re all in a different version of “life” from back then and we are all resubscribed and rolling vanilla.
---
Ayyyy. I got my girl to queue me up a few hours ago, but I'm probably still not playing tonight.
---
hmm,
---
I wrote a similar message to my guild back in like 2006. I was a raid leader and a big presence but I was a sophomore in college and I broke my snowboard and needed new boots. I had no other way of getting $500. Sold that account. 
---
.... they used my personal details for fuck you's and death threats. Sad stuff.
---
NEW OCE PVP SERVER GOGOGO
---
good hunter is hard to play in raids. micromanaging pet to not die to mechanics, melee weaving, kiting stuff. warlock is spamming shadow bolts and sometimes dots on trash.
---
Been in queue since before launch. Nowhere close to getting in.
---
I'm moving 100 spots every five minutes, and it's been slowing down.
---
Still# 2 ... jeez
---
Guys help pls- it’s 9pm EST and been stuck in queue for Faerlina since ~5:15pm EST. Queue position down to 5500 but still saying 2+ hours left. Is this accurate or is the obnoxiously long delay due to the world server being down? I’m scared to exit and lose my position after hours of waiting lol
---
I mean its not like this is a free game
---
Been @ 45, &gt; 1 min for about 30 mins now, lol
---
How are the queues?
---
Real question:
---
How in the fuck am I going BACKWARDS in the que..? For example, I was at 4.1k with a 45 minute wait time. Now I'm at 4.4k with a 50 minute wait time haha. What the fuck is going on?!
---
Stalagg is super fucked. If you aren't playing with people set on going there, consider another realm!
---
I'd say it's mostly working. Updated the main post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxf1lc/aux_auction_house_addon_experimental_classic/
---
Wouldn't promise stability until the weekend though.
---
Meee
---
Yea I'm staying in queue just in case I get lucky and a bunch of people give up but it's not looking like I get to play tonight.
---
Really can you get in instantly? But what if I leave my queue, can’t get in and have to queue again... I’ve been in queue for 3 hours
---
I feel bad for anyone who took PTO or is trying to be in some sort of hardcore race to 60. This must be agonizing.
---
....what?
---
Sodapoppin confirmed it on stream that it was the original Leeroy
---
26k, been 3+ hours and I got in queue right at open. Currently 10088 at estimated 2 more hours, but it periodically goes up. People who are in now are staying in for hours so no hope to get in tonight if you just start now.
---
3000+ with &lt; 1 minute queue. Pay no attention to "estimated time."
---
womp womp
---
I got stuck at 279 on fairbanks and it hasn't moved in 15 minutes
---
Putting aside speculation that they get "preferred" treatment. It's literally their job to make sure they are one of the first people to click login when the login servers came up. If they don't they lose a fat chunk of $$$ in viewers and followers. 
---
For the rest of us it's just a game, for them it's work.
---
I'm not sure, sorry
---
Well I guess that was a true authentic vanilla wow experience.
---
New Oceanic PVP is up.
---
There's a good chance the server lagged and it won't even show up lol
---
Down to 606, prolly going to take 3 hours just to get down from the low numbers
---
Okay will do thanks. That's what I figured , because my queue number is going down, the time is just very off.
---
This is all part of the Vanilla Experience ahhhaaahhha
---
Rationale for this or just opinion?
---
Hi, I just resubbed about 15 minutes ago. I am not seeing the option to install the classic client, only PTR and BFA?
---
Is it currently unavailable to install?  
---
Thanks!
---
but... thats the exact thing they said they fixed! what the hell?
---
i recommend logging out and starting over.
---
How come some servers have now changed from full to high, and high to medium?
---
I love you it worked
---
oops! Fixed
---
Nearly all of the EU realms are low or medium population - what happened? I DC'd from Mograine, came back to a ghost town and there's not even any queue??
---
I been in Q for 4 hours and now I gotta go to bed and work in morning :(
---
Guess it must just be an NA thing. EU has been flawless.
---
Beautiful, 😭😭😭😭😭
---
Started around the same time as you... I'm at 888~. I've been between 6 minutes remaining and 3 hours remaining over the past 3 hours.
---
moderate speed, you wont be able to play soonish, but if you have nothing to do tomorrow I'd stay up for it.
---
Because it would be even worse??????????
---
[HE’S BAACKKK!!!!! to his mum demise ](https://imgur.com/gallery/KqCS0Qh)
---
I’ve gone from over 20k in queue up to 1500. I may make it in and be able to get to level 6 tonight
---
Based on what data?
---
Wondering about other people's thoughts on the 'population' indicator thing. Don't know if it's the same in the US but in the EU some servers flagged as 'Full' went to Medium and even Low. Wondering if Blizzard was deliberately fudging the population indicator pre-launch to encourage..something, or if if they switched from using created characters to actual current population or something.  It's just weird to see the indicated population go *down* on launch night.
---
Ah, I thought it just went by characters created on the realm
---
Inwas sorting /who for max lvl
---
When i dinged five, i was the only lvl5 one, 2nd one was lvl4, if this method is correct or not, idk, regardless tho, i was pretty far ahead
---
No horde allowed, whitemane is a wholesome alliance server for followers of the good boi group.
---
I took too long to get back in the queue when Herod crashed and went from 2k to 20k, currently at 11.5k. Feelsbad
---
What if you just, like, give the driver cash when he shows up?
---
You should not be limited anymore
---
No they won't
---
Maybe so, it's been our experience so far though.
---
I’m at 11k and it dropped from 400 to 5 min I’ll let you know if I get in
---
Nah. That's definitely not true. It says 4mins atm. I still have 9k ahead of me. If it's only 16 minutes more that's fine.
---
Same, still 3650 in Stalagg.
---
I've been in a queue for Mograine for 25 minutes now. So that's wierd.
---
Mmh its a us pvp too?
---
They fixed it pretty fast, thankfully.
---
Its 2/3/4 am in europe right now, people will be sleeping, I'd expect population to rise again in the next few hours
---
People sitting in queues.
---
But the entire idea of layers is they can quickly and temporarily spin up as many as needed. Why isn't that happening?
---
Friends, if your at the character selection screen and receiving the error "world server is down". Try exiting the game to reboot the client and then log back into the server, it worked for me.
---
There is a DC grace period so as long as you already made it past the queue and are at the character selection screen you shouldn't have to go through the queue again.
---
Good luck!
---
Upvote for visibility !
---
Yeah, pacific coast
---
Its literally pointing out a parallel in service of making a point about the first thing. Stay in school, kiddo.
---
Has it really been 15 years since GOT?
---
&gt;Reply
---
now NA next hopefully
---
I got on first and played for 3 1/2 hours. Logged off so I guess I’m done for the week lol
---
Raine? How’s Shaggy been? Wum Ba starting up again?
---
So my time classic launched at 4. I started que at 3:30. Its now 7:20. 9223 people ahead of me. ETA of 4 min. My ass lol.
---
MOAR DOTS MORE DOTS !!
---
I’m on stalagg. Been waiting since 4:30. With a que of 3767. My time (8:21pm).
---
go to sleep now, wake up in 6 hours
---
yeah, long term you are much better off dealing with the queue than ending up on an empty server with folks who just went there to avoid the queue - those of the folks who will quit raids, stop playing, etc.  Those servers will be dead in two months.
---
Wake up -&gt; shower -&gt; work -&gt; WOW -&gt; Sleep
---
/repeat
---
Same. Met some awesome people and established some questing buddies... I got disconnected at 01:10 approx. Had 15,000 queue, said 75minutes. 2 hours and a bit later there are still 6000 in front. Time to call it a night and hope for the best tomorrow
---
Argg I'm at 6.5k whitemane wondering is switching's worth it lol
---
Yikes. I have an 8:00 AM tomorrow...I’ll give staying up a shot
---
1000 minute quee here
---
Well, it's like 1:20 AM grenwich mean time, and even later on much of the continent. Maybe everyone just gave up and went to bed?
---
grob has slowed to a fuckin crawl i'm at 9628 lmao
---
You can just reselect your server from the server list w/o closing the client if that makes anyone uncomfortable.
---
I don't get it. The point of layers is to have less servers with layers that slowly subside and condense when less people play. Why is there not more layers? How did the fuck it up again.
---
15000 plebs in the queue
---
15000 plebs 
---
Kick one through, dc them too
---
I’m at 13877. When I got home at 3:45 PST I was at 22680. Good luck!
---
Don't put the needle in your arm
---
Meta
---
Well this aged well...
---
Just making characters now that i cant log in
---
You have never known the joy of falling asleep in Hell difficulty Diablo 2 with a hardcore character at 4 AM, only to be startled awake by the sounds of your own bloodcurdling screams.
---
Oh well, guess it's time for a sorceress!
---
This reminds me why I ended up rolling on a low pop server in vanilla wow that came out at the last minute call Dethicus.
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
So fun sitting here in a 4 hour queue while watching literally every streamer running and playing with all their friends.
---
Similar story here. Thankfully working in Gamedev and absolutely love my career now. Not only did I take time off and go back (because grades were shit). But my portfolio was awful coming out of college. because all I did was play WoW (Vanilla BC and Wrath days).
---
I had fun. But I was an idiot.
---
People have to stop telling others to switch servers. Often times you've picked a server because a bunch of friends or your guild is there. It's hard to communicate in the moment for everyone you're going to play with to switch especially since some of your friends are already playing.
---
I'm a dumb ass for assuming my low pop server would stay low pop while I made dinner and shit and logged off
---
You're retarded
---
Been in queue since 5:45 EST for incendia and am 1266 in line......
---
same, my mins say 800, which is about 13 hours.. LOL
---
I know there's lots of rightfully upset people right now but I cannot help but [grin just a little bit](https://i.imgur.com/6gmHwGL.png).
---
I've lost track of what the word "irony" actually means; is this it?
---
Lmao delete this fam
---
[So, you're telling me there's a chance?](https://i.imgur.com/cSrcwR7.png)
---
That's an interesting sub.
---
Entitled.
---
Estimated time isn't even remotely close to accurate, mine's currently at 339 minutes, fluctuates anywhere from 700+ minutes to &lt;10 minutes, while still being several thousand in queue, I wouldn't use it as any sort of actual indication of when you'll get in.
---
I'm risking it for now to check out the game at least.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah but the big servers still have \~10k queues. it's like the non top 4 servers have just been abandoned.
---
Oh dude, it's the start of a semester. Do it.
---
After 3 tries I got through IF. Lvld to 4 in elwynn then randomly disconnected and I got placed in a 12k queue.
---
Nice. I got analwarts.
---
Soooo... burning crusade? Then wotlk???? The cycle of WoW continues.
---
Zepplins not working, any ideas?
---
i was 6k position logging in 50 min before release, now at 2050 3.5 hr after launch.
---
After a 3 hour nap I hope i'm in the 500s
---
Entitled. I hope I never group with you.
---
I'm not sure if that would still solve the issue. It has worked for me and one other so far.
---
Could be worse. I'm in position 21,132 for 800 minutes on Whitemane.
---
22k
---
Is there a list of which nationalities are primarily on what servers on EU? Not made my character yet but for example I think a lot of Spanish are on Shazzrah.
---
I remember when Blizzard couldn't get people to even go to Stalagg, lol.
---
Ah, the first nightelf exodus.
---
My Bodybuilding carreer is over. 
---
I'm not even mad. I can still writr programs and teach others. 
---
My body is ready
---
Thats nice, dear.
---
it was the part about a wife, right? that's where I was like "nah"
---
Imo. People waiting in Thalnos and Incendius are gonna start doing the same thing.  It should even out with Kirtonos being healthy in the end.
---
11.6k, buddy! *sad fist bump*
---
Only waited a minute 45 minutes into launch but at 8 central time the wait on Bloodsail was an hour, guess the gates got crashed.
---
Welcome to the Vanilla wow experience.
---
Can anyone tell me why Herod is such a popular server?
---
That's what I was thinking, I'm hoping i will be able to get in later in the week.
---
I logged at 5:50CST. So about 2.5 hours. Just put my little one down so just about perfect timing
---
I gotta get me the 'I survived Barrens' chat' shirt.
---
If you have combat logging enabled (I'll admit, I've had it turned on for so long I'd forgotten it's not by default) it saves in the WoW directory.
---
It was so good. Did you play for the first 5-10 min?
---
My buddy was in queue at 7k and now is at 300 . I think blizzard pulled the plug on people
---
Currently playing
---
I’ve been waiting 4 hours for Incendius. 1500 ahead of me. What a night.
---
15 bucks is prolly fair to try it for a month, I know I've spent more on way worse, but don't blame if you get addicted :)
---
Built a brand new pc in December 2018 and I’m still playing 15-20 year old games. Lol
---
100 away on Incendius! I can taste it!
---
Is anyone else experiencing fps issues? It'll be fine for me for like 2 mins and then drop for like 30 secs and the cycle continues. I'm playing on my laptop so I obviously dont expect the best in terms of performance but I've played private servers before with no performance issues. Is this just because its launch and everyone's on at the same time?
---
just moved up like 800spots wooo
---
I mean, you presume to know what he wants.  Give it two months then let’s see what everyone wanted, including this guy.  For all we know, they were right, and most people who are hyped now will have bailed.
---
I did, too, but then EK on Grobulus shit itself so I got booted into a 7k queue after playing for three hours.
---
Depends on realm. Herod had a huge disconnect for everybody I know about 30 mins after launch.
---
Logged in just before 230, and was immediately at 9000....over 4 hours and Im at 3500.
---
All of my friends immediately got online right at 5 PM. I get home at 5:45 PM and there was a 18k queue. Been waiting 3 hours and I still have 9800 people in front of me. I doubt I'll be able to play tonight :(
---
Blizzard underestimating the amount of needed servers since 2004.
---
I can't wait to play with Asmongol......
---
https://i.imgur.com/bhpntiF.png
---
People with work tomorrow* go to bed reeee
---
It was all good and well, until the very virus you created them turns on you 😮😦
---
Sorry but it sounds like your might have accidentally exited the queue bud.
---
Pagle, a “Medium” server. :/
---
I got DCed too. Meanwhile my buddy who was at like 8,000 in queue got right in, and now I'm at 12,000 in queue lol. I was in Elwynn.
---
Yeah, Incendius was a hilariously bad choice over here too.
---
Jumped to 2400
---
Yeah I just lost 3,000 spots in line
---
Just like most people posting on here. 3pm got in queue (had rl stuff to do before) still in queue with roughly 6000 ahead of me. I really hope this dies down and things normalize.
---
No to all. Play what you want. Not hard to find a group. There are some "meme specs" like boomkin that have it hard to get a group but it's more important to just play. If you're new them hunter is a good choice.
---
He’s currently AFK waiting in queue and 3.4k are watching his empty chair.
---
So what takes longer, whitemane q or old school AV?
---
You can't use private server addons because the current client is based off retail, not the old 1.12 that private servers use.  Get your addons through https://willitclassic.com/
---
It's actually retarded that the only mechanic to protect against this can fail so spectacularly. I had the game open for over an hour and a half on the login screen to avoid a queue, moving my mouse and spinning my character every 4 minutes just waiting to avoid a queue. And now I'm fucked anyways with two friends over at the house. Great launch, might as well have been DIII all over again.
---
Happy cake day
---
There are over a million people watching the streamers on twitch. And you’re wondering why they’re let in? Really? Stop being so selfish.
---
I logged in hours before but it kept logging me out.

“Our top priority in planning for WoW Classic’s launch has been ensuring that we are laying the groundwork for strong realm communities that will endure over the months and years to follow, which is why we’re cautiously opening new servers to meet demand,” said Blizzard.
---
Fingers crossed
---
I’m in skeram but have the world server is down bug and am stuck at the character login screen
---
I am not the conspiracy or fuck streamer type, but it is insane how many of them magically have been streaming the game while I have been waiting 4 hours and no end in sight. Not fishy at all.
---
Best of luck! 3k for me.
---
Double that estimate. It slows down the closer you get.
---
It kicked me out multiple times when I did that.
---
We're under 1k! Only 4 hours to go folks!
---
are those faster ques? im afraid to leave the que ive been waiting in for 4 hours
---
0.5 BTC take it or leave it
---
Healer is going to be more sought after than DPS. Don't be a hybrid DPS and pick a pure DPS and you'll be fine. Lol you'll answer your own lat question after playing for a few hours
---
The true vanilla experience,  3 hours into the game and finally breaking away from the crowd the server crashes and get kicked back to 12000 in que....
---
My position is 14500 and it’s been saying 10 minutes estimated for an hour soooo...
---
1. Not bad, you'll just be mailing yourself things a lot.
---
2. It's really not terrible. But tanks and heals have it really easy.
---
3. No the hunter hate is mostly a meme. Hunters actually can pull some pretty nasty DPS if played right. Resto Shaman I have no idea.
---
Joined queue a little after 5:00 pm central time iirc I was ~27k in line. Ended up having to take me nephew to karate and it was testing night so extra long class. Just now getting home at 8:30 and I'm 7861 in queue... I first played back in early 2005. Ah the nostalgia of queue times. Yep...
---
I mean, plenty of people sat at character select but the servers crashed.
---
She: So when does this gaming start?  
---
Me: On monday midnight.
---
She: And when does it end?
---
Me: .......???
---
Fairbanks here, 16k in queue for a whopping 700min estimated time
---
I got lucky and got in directly, major Lagg but my layer didn't dc while my friends several times.
---
theres no way this is real wtf
---
Worst thing is I've been off all week, and am going back to work tomorrow, so I gotta be up at 6.30. Fml.
---
I did the same thing, and got disconnected at level 5 going to Dun Morogh.  That's one way to make sure I don't walk into work like a zombie.
---
Aww damn I thought you didn’t need one for some reason and was gonna download it after the hype died down.
---
Have mine on my druid still too
---
How long are a Q's for the new servers?
---
Well my friends and I are joining Kromkrush so I hope it will last
---
Herod
---
Herod?
---
same, jumped to like 3200ish - reading on the server sub that a bunch of people got DC'd in game
---
That can't be real...
---
All the west coast boomers home from work queue getting longer...
---
Welcome to the Streamer server.
---
I had logged in before launch and I was one of the first trolls in the game. twenty minutes into attempting to kill boars, my power flickered. Since then, i've been in the queue. 5000 left in front of me.
---
Yeah. Honestly, I thought it would be different on both the tech and the player density.
---
Say what I will about wow's design decisions, I always respected their tech. Their products seemed to run well, be fully tested (disclaimer, I haven't bought a blizzard game since wings of liberty), and generally, I expected better latency than private servers. I assumed when I saw a mob, I would be able to see it take damage to go to zero health. Not just instantly go from untagged to dead. 
---
On the layering part: given how emphatic blizzard was that the starter zones would be instanced: yeah, I expected them to be instanced. After they dealt with the massive backlash from sharding and just introduced layering, which is basically just "sharding with a different pr spin", I thought "okay, there will be 50-100 people in the starting zone. Enough that the further out mobs might be camped, but with each player trying to contest say, 3 spawns.
---
I also expected competing players to be rendered, persistently. Maybe your exact position would not update super frequently, but if you were in my zone, I expected you to persistently be rendered on my screen, as in "maybe that dwarf is 10 yards from where you think he is, but there IS a dwarf there". 
---
Really, I expected the game to hold up a lot better. After all, if you are layering it, why not layer it to the point that you can actually do basic mechanics for everyone, like "casting spells" and "drawing nearby players".
---
Is there a way to figure out what time zone these servers are based out of in NA?
---
When you realize you have to queue for 10 hours
---
I gave up and started on Rattlegore.. Hope it isnt dead in a month.
---
Its fucking packed right now
---
Gave up after about 3 hours
---
 I am on a medium server with that que  time so idk
---
Yup. This is the issue. Even with the servers they threw up an hour after queues were reaching insane times. I have a buddy that managed to get on so I'm committed to Skeram now.
---
Friends, if your at the character selection screen and receiving the error "world server is down". Try exiting the game to reboot the client and the. Logging back into the server, it worked for me.
---
There is a DC grace period so as long as you already made it past the queue once and are at the character selection screen you shouldn't have to go through the queue again.
---
Upvote for visibility!
---
(Second time I posted this, it keeps getting buried, but I don't want someone needlessly waiting like I did)
---
Can confirm it's real, I took it myself.
---
ETA means nothing, only position
---
I hope
---
Sorry dude, but their $15 generates tons of traffic and interest to the game. That's why they value them more than us
---
hover over the clock and it will tell you the server time
---
It ended 2 minutes after the servers opened up for me
---
Anyone else feel like blizzard DC’s people on purpose to get others into the game?
---
2480 that's cute. Try 24800 on whitemane lololololololol /wrist
---
You don't have to like that aspect of it - but the fact still stands that there is much more thinking and preparation to maximizing dps in retail than there is to classic
---
I was thinking the same thing as I fired it up today. "Damn, I'll be lucky to get 5 hours a week..."
---
Im at 7.5k right now in Skeram. It was 10.5k at the start...
---
waffels is right the word is *evil*
---
4.5 hours in gave up.  Still had 2500 ahead of me.   Terrible.
---
I hopped on Rattlegore I think the moment it booted. I got in instantly. Had to go put my daughter to bed and I’m still waiting after about 20 min. 
---
Originally planned to play on Stalagg, but it ended up not mattering. My acquaintances who have no obligations were OK with the 600 min queue time there. 
---
Nah. I’m good. Rattlegore sounds cool as hell anyway.
---
That cave where you fight furblogs shamans while finding 3 or 4 quest drops in chests?
---
FUCK that quest.
---
I can’t believe I almost didn’t pick Bigglesworth. Been playing since 6 taking a quick break now. Honestly amazing time
---
About 30 minutes
---
Yes you're probably the only one
---
Firemaw was also chosen by the Nordic countries, Denmark and Norway in particular — ahead of this.
---
damn, you are just ahead of me!
---
nice!
---
Same age roughly for me, burning entire weekends to WoW... good times.
---
Don't forget the warning about severe queues, and then people actually getting shocked and upset when queues are long as fuck
---
See you out in the world!
---
Horde, of course, so watch her back!
---
It's got nothing to do with "company of this size."
---
The servers should be X level pop to function well from a game perspective, not a technical one.  People are crowding on certain servers despite Blizz (by way of a queue) telling them not to.
---
Two days from now, the low pop servers are going to have little to no issue as demand spreads out over the various hours of the day and interest drops a bit.  It's only going to be the queues that everyone knows are overloaded that will continue to be overloaded.
---

---
5k que too
---
He should clearly play a death knight.
---
Initially an 11 minute queue time has turned into a 3 hour wait. We shall try again tomorrow!
---
Ouch. Hold on pal.
---
Its an old meme sir, but it checks out.
---
There's a civil war between english speakers and spanish speakers going on lol
---
Watching some idiot on Twitch play WoW is not providing anything beneficial if they can't get in. The feeling is mutual btw.
---
I wouldn't take what people say here to heart dude, peeps are just passionate and invested is all. And a lot have had to deal with people telling them they were stupid for wanting classic so now they feel like it's their chance to "punch back" so to speak. You're still allowed to like what you like. Anyway, appreciate the niceness. &lt;3
---
Whitemane just started blazing thru the queue. I was over 2k for like 2 hours and now it jumped down like 500.
---
Could you have accidentally had hit enter?
---
i dont have an addon button, what folder should they be in? they are in the addons folder of interface??
---
No. People will RP with other RPrs, theres never pressure to RP.
---
Think of it as a Picnic and not drinking. You're still enjoying the party, you're just not drinking. No one is going to be angry you didn't have a coors with your uncle.
---
I said if they are banking on 80% of the pop leaving queue times are a good nudge to get that to happen. But thanks for clarifying your speculation, I thought there was data backing up the claim seeing as it's so popular to spout it on this sub.
---
Rekt. I get off at 1 am est and I’m worried I won’t get in
---
Set the game to windowed in settings
---
Mine says 20 minutes but I'm 19,000th in queue. Seems like blizzard got these estimates figured out.
---
any new servers at this hour?
---
Try using Azeroth Auto Pilot. I’ve been using it to level 10 atm
---
Dude same here best few hours of gaming lately and I took off work for this tomorrow so I get to play all night hell yeah
---
i was on at 5:30 and am still at 4446 on stalagg
---
Any one knows current queue on Noggenfogger EU?
---
BFA peaked at [590k](https://sullygnome.com/game/World_of_Warcraft/longtermstats), so Classic almost doubled the number.
---
Queue is flying now. Wonder what changed
---
This might be my favorite comment yet on here.
---
I’d be scared graduating into a possible recession with C’s though... unless your compsci or nursing or something else in high demand
---
"Did we underestimate the number of people wanting to play Classic?"  
---
"No, it is the children who are wrong!"
---
Went to a mates with my desktop and table all set up ready for launch this morning. I'm in Australia so the servers opened up at 8:00AM so I took work off. Sat down and booted up to find out my mates dad threw his long ass internet cable out (built my computer without wireless - oops! regerets). Lucky I was only 5 mins from home so I packed everything up and sped home. Got back at exactly 8:00am and logged into an 6.6k Q. Its now midday and I'm down to 2.7k. my mate still got in to play and has been ahead of the curve this whole time. fucking asshole. oh well. IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING TILL I PLAY!
---
We can do this. 1am is my cut off. If I get in at 1am ill play for an hour or 1.5
---
No. I've been on RP servers for years. Thats not how it is. People who RP will RP with people who want to RP. That's it. If you don't RP no one is going to be a shit to you.
---
Position in queue 3600
---
Estimated time 3 minutes
---
That's a fing lie
---
have your uncle fix my fucking que
---
As a now somewhat older guy that's married with a kid, classic wow is kind of appealing since there isn't a constant moving target of increasing level caps.
---
Bit late to release a new server when most are already queued/invested in Arugal.
---
Bedtime for some folks? A limit of 4 hour patience?
---
Thank you. I logged in later in the evening and was worried as I waited in the queue that even if I got through I wouldn't be able to make a character.
---
They feel like a ... bag of sand
---
Which is because every server has a population of medium or higher. What's hard to get?
---
The downside to that is when they completely remove layering in phase 2, if they just keep making these servers bigger and bigger via layering, there will be absurd queue times basically every single day once it gets removed.
---
Is there any way to tell this without selecting each server on the list?
---
Would it not be faster to take the boat to Stormwind from Darkshore?
---
is there a kromcrush discord?
---
I'll even give points for the reflection.
---
I think it would be cool to have a war room looking like this, monitoring the playerbase in realtime so they can add more layers.
---
And aside from the lag and massive amount of people stuck on loot quests causing more lag, I think they pulled off this launch quite well. The temptation to temporarily tweak drop/spawn rates in the first day of the launch  would've eased the madness a bit, but hey #nochanges amirite.
---
The first week will probably be rough. After that I'd expect it to taper off significantly. My biggest worry is that when major content releases or big events happen we'll have big queues again.
---
Are the classic servers going to down tomorrow morning? What will happen to people in queues?
---
Hey everyone. I tried to log on today, just for the hell of it, using my Cellphone as a hot-spot, won't have net till I get off work tomorrow.
---
My problem is they said my account was locked for suspicious activity and they sent me an email. I was eventually able to log in, but it was weird. I checked the email and all it said was.

Nothing to click to confirm that I'am the owner and to say this was a normal login.
---
I just recently moved, talking 3,000 miles from where I used to live, I just don't want this to become an issue when I try to play tomorrow.
---
Has anyone else had this happen before, and can give me some information on if I should be worried or not?
---
They're all full
---
Did you restart the game after you installed the addons?
---
dude , it's all about server space blizz is a corporation and they are not going to spend the extra money on server space. If you had it your way and they increased the amount of space for one or two days when everyone wants to play and then a few days later not as many people are not going to be playing at one time . then it would be a sunk cost to have that extra space . If you want to understand why a problem isn't getting fixed for a long period of time just follow the money .
---
311 and 3 minutes
---
Deserved
---
anybody else on whitemane notice the queue drop about 600 people within the last 5 minutes? we might actually get to play tonight holy moly
---
520est here on Faerlina. Only at 3781
---
My current queue is 768 minutes....
---
I think I saw a drop for sure, time and numbers. People going to bed probably. Only bad thing about the Atlantic time zone is that I’m an hour ahead of everyone lol.
---
flying?\~! where for you
---
Back then, not heal until tank gets some threat on all mobs. If they do pull threat, don't run away or run around like a fool. Know fight mechanics and not die to stupid stuff. Be backup cc/fear. Know their healing spells and manage throughput vs mana.
---
lol
---
Kids gotta go to school. Adults gotta go to work. I took Tuesday off. The strong will enter Azoroth tonight
---
Yea i started work at 8 aest which is when the servers opened. Hopefully when i get home it will be playable
---
$15USD a month. Whatever that transfers to in your currency. It's like $18.50 CAD for me
---
whitemane - Started at 6:10 pm EST at 21k, about to make it below 10k. 4 hours later. Seems to be moving faster though for some reason.....or I've just been scrolling reddit and facebook waiting for it that I'm losing touch with reality.
---
Waiting to get into Bigglesworth since 6:53 PM CT, started at 13420. Currently 9:01 PM CT and not even halfway. 
---
Blizz, to quote an iconic character from this franchise: You are not prepared.
---
Lmao I was thinking the same thing. 
---
Coulda sat in queue or bartended and made some scrill. Hopefully there wont be a queue when I try to log on
---
.
---
They released new servers if you dont have ties on those servers and just wanna play try em out.
---
mine went from 30 minutes to 29 minutes over the course of 30 minutes and my queue position went from 5k to 4921.
---
Meanwhile, there is half a million dollars worth of monthly subscriptions sitting in the queue for precisely that with me.
---
Which realm?
---
Stayed at work later thinking I'd skip the launch shitshow. Finaly decided to sit down and log in, 4 hours after launch.. every server is full are you kidding me
---
Incendius: population medium. Queue 12199 time 417 mins... Medium my ass
---
Any low queue servers right now?
---
You mean binge queuing
---
not sure if just trying to lower que times...
---
You can only have 50 characters. If he goes to a server with no queue he wont even be able to create a char. To delete one of the 50 he will need to sit in queue.
---
Maybe if you believe hard enough
---
Anyone else having the queue disappear and just show the log in screen? This happened to me twice so far. Luckily the second time I caught it and got put back in my spot.
---
Only bfa is going down
---
Thank you friendly stranger. I hope you have fun with the current game too. TBC was the last expansion I enjoyed, but like you say, we all have different opinions on what makes a good game.
---
And guys, stop downvoting reasonable posts just because you don't agree with it.
---
/u/vredditshare
---
Can some of you playing on Pagle go to bed so I can play for like idk an hour?
---
Thank u
---
So is there no way to try out classic for free like the normal game? Wont let me join a server with a starter account
---
I've been at 147 under a minute left for a few minutes now, it is so close.
---
JOIn a neW sERver OR YOu MaY EXperieNCE SeveRE qUEUeS
---
just commented the same thing right above your's about losing sanity and thinking I was noticing it too. thank god its not just me. lmao
---
Lol mine is 700 min then 150..now 710
---
hope you dont get in then get kicked for inactivity while you finish your nap
---
Cultural stagnation
---
Fucking christ! I said i wasnt gunna play this game again but I find myself slipping into the abyss
---
Trying to log in on Faerlina, queue time is 16 hours or 980 minutes.
---
I forgot to mention I was already in window mode, I have double monitors if that helps.
---
Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for.
---
Thank you so much.
---
Will WoW classic get updates or is what we get the final version of WoW classic?
---
none are less than 5k it seems
---
Can you tech me how to send her to China?
---
Don’t know exactly but everything is 3 hours+.
---
20k people per server *think* you do, but you don't!
---
Guys, blizzard is a very small indie company with virtually no experience running MMO games.
---
You can’t be upset with them for the state of this launch.
---
A lot of buggy addons right now...it's to be expected on the first day :/
---
I'm surprised by the amount of people saying they are still waiting in queues when Blizzard has released several new servers. I jumped on Kromcrush (PVP - Eastern) when it was released after launch, got to level 8, and now ready for bed.
---
Small guild of friends. Only one person made it onto our server.
---
My apologies if I am coming off as rude. I'm just frustrated.
---
If there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of players simply WAITING to get into your game, you massively underestimated the demand and fucked up your release. Blizzard is a seasoned company that doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes, which explains a lot about their recent "success".
---
Been in queue on Whitemane myself since 2:45 and at 7000 with “300 min” to go 🤬
---
I just switched to rattlegore from whitemane. 30 min queue with 2600
---
shift+win+s
---
this usually happens because a zone crashes and a ton of people get kicked. so while its a good sign for the queue once your in its a bad sign for you
---
Stalagg
---
Does anyone have any clue how long it will be before this queue stuff dies down? I’ve been trying to play since 7:00 EST and I haven’t been able to yet.  My queue did get reset twice cause my internet took a dump but my friend who had been trying since about 6:00 didn’t get in by 9:30 either. lol
---
I’m not complaining, I understand why it is necessary, but how long do we think it will last?
---
seriously, if anything the mangos guys should be thanked. THEY made the server that every big vanilla pserver uses to this day. Literally every server is branched off a mangos build.
---
They were logged in at character screen hours before the game went live. I did the same and had no que
---
NO CHANGES DansGame
---
I was at 20k in the queue with an estimated 20 minutes.  Back up to 765 now.
---
Tbf 30 min before Launch seems a little short sighted unless you didn't have a choice
---
My connection is stable - I'm just worried I'll get kicked for AFKing in character selection once I'm past the queue. 
---
I guess I'll have to wait and see. Good luck to you.
---
Also curious for 5pm me
---
Couples that play together stay together.
---
I'm currently 6969 on Grob... oh yeah! At least I was part of the first wave that joined right when the clock hit 0. I got the first Arena Master on Grobbulus on my level 6 dwarf paladin, killing a level 1 troll hunter and level 1 orc rogue before getting DC'd in Ironforge while bragging about it on trade chat.
---
Can i stay at login screen or as AFK ingame and not be disconnected? Almost in now but need some sleep 🥺
---
Really bad. Not sure about new server
---
the estimated time comes from a random number generator
---
Is there no way to have quest givers show on the minimap with exclamation points? I thought that had always been in wow since it was there in BC.
---
How do you know you have all the quests in a town otherwise? Just wandering around making sure you didnt miss any?
---
I've been in q since 15 mins before launch. Que is about 12k and its going down at 1 person every 2-5 minutes. My position is 226. All the best.

---
They just added a second PVP server.  I was on it with 0 queues for a half an hour maybe and got dropped
---
People tend to play with other people in this game, if they  have full groups going to servers you gotta stick with the crew.
---
Probably Divinity: Original Sin 2
---
On Pagle?
---
Seems like it may be fixed now, logged out for a few minutes and went to smoke then came back and could join a group and play together.
---
Totally agree.  I hope we can all agree they should have had some more servers from the start for reservations.
---
Explore elsewhere?
---
No.
---
It’s amazing people aren’t willing to skip these quests...
---
Master warchief
---
A lot of users are committed to going with a guild or friends that are already established on servers.
---
That gif is \~180MB. I don't know what software you're using but you need a much lower framerate.
---
I’m at work watching this I’ll be back home soon.
---
Did it as a CompSci major, was easy. They didn't take attendance in most classes and all you had to do was complete the project work and/or study the night before for exams. I put in maybe 16 hours a week with good grades :)
---
Did it a couple times now, lose your spot every time.
---
Tbh about 2 weeks . No fucking lie
---
What server?
---
Should normalize by tomorrow unless you decided to play on Whitemane and Herod. In which case you have no right to complain because you did it to yourself.
---
Just more authentic to the true classic experience
---
Fuck you Blizzard. You knew the hype was insane with that new trailer and you still fucked this up.
---
It's almost like people want to play with their friends, so jumping to random servers that were released at the last moment isn't a viable solution.
---
&gt;All I could do was laugh. Anyway my 11 day vacation starts later this week, that's when the fun begins.
---
It's easy to have that perspective when you have a vacation lined up. Some people called out of work or asked for the day off to play, and these queue times make it, quite literally, unplayable. The annoying part is the amount of times people kept asking for more servers for them to wait until the last minute to add any, and then have them get full within a couple of hours of release.
---
Oh, so fml then yeah?
---
For an online game that’s a miracle of the highest order.
---
Dinged 7 on Incendius then hopped off to let the less fortunate play some. Good luck!

Launch Queue: Break yourselves upon my body!
---
I like to think of a medium as of a rough stone. While it's rough edges inevitably hurt someone it's also what give it character.
---
A 100% perfect marble might not hurt (or displease) anyone but it also doesn't have any character and is a completely forgettable experience.
---
When the thing your want people to care about turns into a forgettable experience, you fucked up.
---
HUSFET 10 MORE MINS TGHBE DEMONS
---
I lost my spot taking a look at another server, did it a few times even just to double check your bullshit.
---
This has nothing to do with server setup but the amount of servers. They said they wanted to keep things relatively low pop (3-4x original numbers). They  got about 10x that which means we all have to wait.
---
The rogue tears I can taste them through this queue...
---
It was seen as ultra casual compared to games at the time and that was their intention form the birth of the game. Casual and accessible for gamers who weren't hardcore mmorpg'ers. They just kept going too far until things in the game lost all meaning due to chasing that accessibility.  
---
WoW just struck a great balance between too hardcore and too casual for awhile that the majority of people could find interest in.
---
I guarantee it will be more popular then retail from here on out.
---
I certainly hope so! We’re on Thalnos.  lol
---
Lucky. I got in an hour after launch. The estimated time is stuck at 4 minutes, but theres 5000 people ahead of me
---
15 years and Activision Blizzard hasn't learn how to launch a game
---
Lmaoooooooo if I could give you gold
---
Tbh it's been great fun, particularly since being able to group up with my partner (who was sitting in the same room with me... took 3 hours to be able to group up together!)
---
What were they thinking a month ago..
---
Whitemane
---
Stormwind didnt get its harbor until Wrath.
---
Because they're all full.
---
remulos is 100% stable. I was on it for a while. Quite a few people are level \~12 by now.
---
Faerlina
---
Nope, was not in vanilla, you were expected to look around :)
---
Addons like Questie will add them to the map though.
---
Queued up at 4:30 CT and its currently 9:18 and I'm still in queue. Started at 12000 or so and I'm at 3392. I'm on the Stalagg server. This is ridiculous.

---
Yeah the estimated times are way off, my queue started at 21k and that was 4 hours and 14 minutes ago. 300 ahead of me now.
---
Named mob respawn times at low levels need to be MUCH faster. Took us 1.5 hours to kill Zalazane.
---
vanilla servers capped out at around 2500 concurrent users. Strangely enough though, higher pops are definitely better. You have to experience  a server with 10k guys on at once. It's fun as hell. It feels very alive
---
It counts accounts rather than characters since you can only play one character at a time per account.
---
They are adding more servers right now?
---
I joined kromcrush an hour ago. It was listed as medium pop by i was placed 8000th in queue. 2400 now.

While you think of it as a 'way of speeding the process' I see it as a way of getting out of kalimdor, I love the NE starting zones, but you will only find more horde the more south you go. Might as well do it as soon you finish darkshore or ashenvale, unless you have a mage friend, you will have to get there anyways.
---
iv waited 15 years i can wait 15 mins
---
See i figured he had characters spread across ALL servers but i just now thought about the new ones that are being added in

how did they manage to misspell mankirk come on
---
I know, right? is there a reason why these servers are NOT auto-scaling?
---
has blizzard run out of money?
---
Well tbh.. I had no idea there was a beta or stress testing and I game all the time (just not wow) I'm sure 90%+ were just like me...
---
Lol, I don’t blame you.
---
Started at 6pm at 10k. Now at 514
---
holy shit
---
I watched detective Pikachu and it was bad. Really really bad.
---
50 total, 10 per realm
---
idk if this is copy pasta but I thought George Cloony stood out more than Sandra Bullock in that movie.
---
Same mates are smashing leveling on arugal so going to different server isnt really possible. Man that que time is fucked.

You can eat in less than 15 minutes. You can also skip workout.

They want server caps too I guess? To limit the amount of people per server total. 
---
If they let everyone layer up on Herod, for example, then they’d have zero chance of removing layering post phase 1. I still think some servers are borked and will have layering longer anyway but at least they’re trying to contain us.

Sweet!
---
So your choices are melee: warrior, rogue, druid, paladin, and shaman and ranged: hunter, mage, warlock, shaman, and druid.
---
Be aware that druid and shaman are "hybrid" classes.
---
Is there a particular class you identify with from Hearthstone?
---
Pretty safe bets for new players are Mage or Hunter. Mage can be a little weak when single target leveling, but they offer so much in terms of pvp, pve, and utility.
---
Additionally, paladin are alliance only and shaman are horde only.
---
We were lined up on Atiesh, Coldridge mountain quests.  Picking up Felix's box of bolts and other stuff.  Lining up to kill Grik'Nir.  And those asshats who jumped the line, we will remember.
---
When realms launch do you have to relish to see them if ur in the realm selection screen or should they just randomly appear
---
samme issue here
---
they’ve already opened up 4 servers
---
Our prophet, Medivh...!

10k is nothing compared to full EU realms.
---
Is it possible to transfer characters from realm to realm like you could back in Vanilla? I am on a high pop realm, and I'm strongly considering just making a character on a low pop realm then transferring it over once everything dies down.
---
To me it was like Avatar where it was basically only worth seeing it on a giant movie screen in 3-D. The shots of space in Gravity in 3-D were really something else.
---
My assumption would be tonight in order to resolve the 12k+ Queue on each server
---
Eat infront of your computer then. If you plan to be AFK for around an hour... you should kinda log out, fair for every other people in queue, no?
---
No wonder the submissions were locked... they open it and most of the posts are just pics of peoples queues.  Very interesting.
---
I purposefully chose an East coast server so I can play late on the west coast but it's at the third highest queue time so that's not looking like a sound decision.
---
While I thankful to be able to afford another $15 a month, I am an adult with a job. Could easily spend more than both accounts for the month if I went to a bar once a month. Not bad for the countless entertainment I'll get..
---
It’s not up yet from what I see, don’t worry
---
Fuckin casual.
---
&gt; I don't think crazy VR shit will ever be the norm. People want to sit the fuck down and smoke weed while they half ass pay attention.
---
That won't stop it because VR is more than just gaming, and even if restricted to gaming, you can still play seated in many games.
---
Me and the boys were wandering around the Venture Co. Mines for twenty minutes looking for Supervisor Frizsprocket
---
*All* of us dinged.
---
*All* of us spat on his corpse.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
Anyone having problems with ELVUI party frames?
---
Mine aren't showing and I can't figure it out.
---
Big ole nope. Skip quest and grind away imo
---
reading the quest. like it was back in the day.
---
I just cut lol
---
How...I’m only at 1223.... lol
---
This is beyond retarded
---
Sounds like you would love it.
---
Your source is my source. You bolded one clause of a sentence and ignored the second part. “Before the beginning of phase 2.” As in, before phase 2... there are multiple layers with entire realm populations.
---
Their objective is that there will only be one layer at the beginning of phase 2.
---
Been in queue for 4 and a half hours. Just wondering if anyone else has been waiting this long. It would make me feel slightly better knowing I'm not alone
---
&gt; Exactly this. Whiskey is my vice and I don't want to be drinking with a headset on.
---
Your whiskey will be scanned in real-time and seen in the headset with future headsets, so that won't be an issue.
---
Will I be missing out if I start playing next month? I have FOMO, but it's not reasonable in my current life to play launch week.
---
Going druid, wanna DPS. Which spec is better in classic for end game - feral or boomkin? Which one would feel better to play? I didn't play the original game a whole lot as a kid because, well, I was an actual child, so I never made it to the endgame. I imagine I'm going to be OOM a lot as a boomkin, right? How does feral feel?
---
And what professions should I opt for?
---
I've been stuck at 300 minutes for over two hours.
---
Whitemane. Sucks my guild chose a high population server and won't switch.
---
Either you’re correct or they are artificially limiting the number of layers for whatever reason.
---
It released at 8am here and I finish at 3:30pm... This is killing me, 2 and a half hours to go.
---
yes me too
---
A post full of Nope.
---
AAP (Azeroth auto pilot) with questions was beneficial until I got kicked
---
Getting the medallion as a troll was so awful I tried to reroll like an idiot and couldn’t log back in without a queue of 30 minutes
---
I forgot about priest as well for ranged dps!
---
I’m still mad we don’t have vr that doesn’t make me want to vomit
---
Askhandi with around 15 minutes queue
---
dungeon spam is actually the quickest way to 60.
---
I'm on Hydrazian Waterlords EU. Just played for 4 hours, got to lvl 10, feels real good man.
---
you are not alone brother
---
I've been trying to get into Thalnos since 6 EST. It's nearly 11. How is this acceptable? lmao.
---
Deviate Delight is after my own heart with that server name.  Sulfuras though....great choices for late servers!
---
Yeah fair point. To scale infinitely would ruin that plan.
---
You won’t be saying that in a few weeks.
---
I’d give it a week or two, I bet it gets a lot better
---
God damn. I had 56k until like 2005 or 2006.
---
You can invest in zygor if you want your hand held

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvy9wy/can_i_leave_my_game_on_overnight_while_waiting_in/). 
---
I made a character at "launch", too.  I'm talking about 6pm when servers opened, when they were SUPPOSED to auto logout people camping character selection menus like they told Esfand they would do.  Obviously a PR move on Blizzards part so that all the streamers get in.
---
Same, still at 6k in que
---
Yeah even once the initial hype has died down, the longterm health of the game looks very promising.
---
Is there any way to see the horde/alliance balance of a server other than the tiny sample self-reported survey? Its kind of a big deal when selecting a server...
---
I've been in queue since 3:30PST sooo... Just over 4 hours.
---
Whitemane here.
---
1130 queue time (18 hours)
---
57392 position
---
They have had years to figure this out, at this point they shouldn't get passes. They didn't need servers they needed servers that could handle the load, they didn't go that route, they went with a lets see what happens route.
---
It sounds like you don't even play current wow, or havent in a very long time.
---
The very concept of guild rewards as you're talking about them hasn't been in retail for years.
---
You don't really get anything for being in a guild now. The only reason to be in one is either social, or for progress - i.e. - Raiding or PvP.
---
It's no different to classic.
---
was at 2500 on Thalnos after 4 hours.... had a fucking tornado cause an emergency and now that im back, had to reset and now im back at 11000
---
Bliz get your fucking shit together.
---
Wow what a casual. I saw someone complaining about low drop rates. Welcome to the thunderdome, bitch!
---
3 hours here. And the ETA is a tease. Jumps around from 83minutes back to 400 minutes. 13k left in the que. Started at 22k
---
ich bin müde
---
lmao feel ya
---
Same thing for Garrick in Northshire
---
Hopefully you don’t get dced like a lot of people did. I was in for an hour and it booted me now I’m in a 8k queue
---
3 hours 45 minutes. Right here with ya
---
Many of us seem to be
---
k thanks
---
must people on here are in a queue I imagine
---
Position in queue: 23175
---
now they say we are getting an eastern rp-pvp AFTER I ROLL ON GROB WTF
---
Yes I am, so you would say it’s not too bad?
---
&gt; Will my spot in que be held if I try another server? For how long?
---
No it will not. The queue resets to whichever server you are queued for.
---
Jesus christ, 1000 minutes.  This is insanity.
---
Literally next to google head quarters. 75 mb. No google fiber available.
---
Can you link the website please
---
I hope so. I'd consider it if you could. Someone reply to me too if they know the answer.
---
Rumour has it on the Twittersphere that over 6 million have tried to login since launch.
---
You think you do, but you dont
---
If that's true you can add it to the 5 mil that are avoiding the launch horde.
---
Where you find this?
---
Yup, no need for changes when 95% of people just use questie.
---
I remember watching the clip of the Diablo Immortal announcement.  Dude seemed really unsteady and hesitant, kind of like he knew it wasn't going to be that well accepted, but I don't think he expected it to go that badly.  That can kind of ruin your flow when you're presenting something.
---
Way quicker to just grind mobs and get the exp and move on.
---
Did you actually get to play?  
---
Most of my guild was stuck in queue all night.  We have way to many people in our extended player network to simple swap servers when they release a new one, so we all just had to sit and watch the queue number NOT go down.
---
Beggars can't be choosers
---
the game opened literally 5 hours ago. How are you at 5.5? lol.
---
Myzrael went from High Pop to Medium Pop because of people moving to the new realms, and there was no queue time around 3.5 hours ago. Thought I'd be fine to log off and eat dinner with the fam.
---
I come back to a 90 minute queue time. God fuck. I just wanna play before bed :(
---
Hillsbrad, stvietnam, tanaris gets on and piping sometimes.  Most times you can make wpvp happen just by starting some bullmess.
---
Yeah, if you think just getting a better job is that easy for everyone you're really fucking privileged. I don't give a shit what you went through, you're privileged and your denial of it makes you an asshole too. Go fuck yourself you elitist prick
---
They could have 50% drop and many servers would still have queues...
---
Steal the kill.
---
Not sure what's so hyperbolic about sharing my experience. I didn't say anything about the frequency of things like this for anyone else, but I did have it happen at least a couple times personally is all
---
yOu tHiNk yOu dO bUt yOu dOnT
---
I thought Leeroy died? I would love to be wrong.
---
Servers went live 5 hours ago.
---
Seen it as well. Thought maybe elvui was causing a bug.
---
I'm glad I switched too kromcrush when it first opened; all my guild moved over, and we've been playing smoothly for hours, while also being able to keep all our names; we have over 100 in our guild now playing smoothly.
---
It shouldn't be that difficult of a trip to make (because of Zeppelins between the continents) but if I were you I'd try to work your way through your starting zones until like level 11 or 12 and then meet up and quest through the Barrens together. It isn't much less efficient and if you guys want to play together sooner rather than later, go for it.
---
People in the Grobb que go switch to the new RP PVP server fucking pleaseeeeeee
---
&gt; Be prepared to wait 8 hours 
---
why? O.o
---
*slaps ass*
---
**Hello Susan**
---
Crossroads raid anyone? Anyone?
---
So i must go to Blizzcon and ask for Wow2  (Classic with todays shiny graphic and VR support)
---
They've been in complete denial about the popularity of Classic this entire development.  Even when the fact you just presented was staring them in the face.  They kept telling us that no one wants Classic and they probably still believe it.
---
I was in at 5:15 est and am fucking kicking myself for not realizing you wouldn't be kicked after 30 mins. Still 6.5k in queue after logging in at 5:42 est.
---
Indeed we did. I'm just glad I didn't take time off work for it lol.
---
I’m feeling too much!
---
Yeah I wish. My server just had people huddle around him lol. We asked and the line like started with 10 people and then stopped about 3 minutes after lol. So it turned into who could hit him the fastest lol
---
Yeah not me. I would go right up to the front and kill what I need. Or I would just go somewhere else.
---
Yeah Ashkandi is the move right now on the east coast
---
HOLY SHIT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  
---
Hood and all.
---
yeah... everyone I planned to play with decided to switch to Incendius today because we thought the queue time would be negligible since it was brand new... oh how wrong we were.
---
Oof my dude
---
They say theyre openeing more servers "Very Soon". But Im unsure if thats a *Tonight* "Very Soon", or a *By the end of the week* "Very Soon."
---
Not everyone is drinking. Not everyone RPs. It's probably close to 50 percent.
---
This!
---
in an empty server, with practice, getting to lvl 10 where the zones meet up would take about 2 hours. IMO you should do your own zones then group up in the Barrens. Grouping up the whole way to 60 is also going to be tough because there's a limited amount of quests and you're cutting your kill XP in half.
---
Zero queue, I just created my characters and am in.
---
Logging out was a tough choice tonight. I was in the mood for more but sadly LiFe and RoUtIne forces me into bed. We only live once man, why can't we just waste away in azeroth...? 
---
totally agree with you. It was a satisfying experience and the most fun I've had in a long while!!!! can't wait for tomorrow
---
I remember doing this on my night elf Druid back in 2005 and dying so many god damn times... and then you get to the area in the tunnels where the orcs are camped up in the mountains and it’s terrifying seeing a ?? level mob in vanilla running at you when corpses of other night elves were littered along the roads
---
Based on how long i was in que you lookin at 4-6 hours.
---
I’m at 15k atm. Class started today so I queued at 5:10pm PST.  Excited for the prospect of people going to bed before I play. 13k in 3 hours hoping the second half goes faster
---
oof, I'm 2 hours in and 3k queue @ Pagle. There was only 2 EST normal servers when I looked before, I'm scared to lose my spot lol.
---
My PC just surged and broke if that makes you feel better
---
biggest world PVP zones were always STV, South Shore / Tarren Mill for leveling zones.  Blackrock Mountain for jumping guilds heading to raid, and Stonetalon / Redridge for ganking lowbies
---
whew just did the “Undead run to Org” and had some Zep turbulence.
---
How the fuck do you accidentally type delete in order to delete your character?
---
I hope this gets better very soon and this isnt the norm.
---
the new rp pvp server didnt drop yet
---
In emergency situations like these it will be free.
---
Yeah turns out dead meat is delicious.
---
I also realized today that undead tits bounce when they walk
---
yeah seriously. I was at 9 minutes at 15k. Got to 12k and went to 9 hours
---
I've been in Stalagg queue since 6:30pm. Still at 13k.
---
Sounds awesome! I'm glad there is a sense of community again-- it always seemed to be missing in more modern iterations of WoW for me.
---
Am I better off sitting through a 30 minute queue or just trying every server until I get lucky with a much shorter queue?
---
I wish they'd say when we actually get them
---
Tot realm?
---
Ew. It should be a free one time thing for this situation.
---
Same left for Kromkrush, when the hype dies down if i'm still playing i'll just pay for the transfer. 4,000 queue way better then 15,000.
---
Yea that's what it should be. At least once.
---
same and I just hit 300. Soon(tm)
---
id like an east coast server but now i have friends who are rolled on what was the ONLY rp-pvp server.. facepalm.
---
Had to leave myself got to lvl 8 undead warlock... took forever on open for mobs and the like... had to go to work. Will play in the morning when I get off and hopefully can queue into the game.
---
Stuck at 237 for 20 mins straight
---
Natural selection. No but seriously, either you're 11yo, either you need therapy.
---
Ima enjoy this...make a few alts once the queues die down. I’m having a blast
---
We formed a neat, orderly line to kill Sarkoth. Then it devolved into anarchy and my group somehow got the kill.
---
Flash forward, the four of us are standing on a rock doing ritualistic summoning dances to get the scorpid workers to spawn. 10/10 would form scorpion cult again.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294723/launch-classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc
---
estimated queue times here
---
On whitemane? Yes. Herod and whitemane and stuff will have insane queues all week. Play kromcrush or something and you probably wont even have a queue tomorrow.
---
My general advise especially for horde is do the starter zones for your race and meet up in the barrens. Tauren/undead is harder than any other combination to trace to one another but it’s not terribly bad but the time used running could get you a decent start in your zone.
---
Yeah another 3.5 hours til I try to log in and I imagine the vast majority of people will be crashing by then.   Ez logins.
---
Bet they are dcing people on purpose so the people who were too slow get their "fair" chance
---
Stalaag queue just went down 5k!
---
Yeah, let's give the wow community a chance to libel and shun people... brilliant idea.
---
Fuck is the server down?
---
Undead warlock here. Spam 1 attack and either stand on the mob spawn or tab target them. Get the first hit the cast.
---
you aint getting in in 17 mins lol
---
Just went from 6.4k to 730k in queue on Stalagg in an instant. Looks like Blizz has started opening up new layers.
---
Fcking beta baby, get ur ass back in there and grind later it's not hard to get to 7
---
Beautiful, thanks friend!

I've never seen this show. My mom just passed. This &gt;2minute clip has me bawling
---
Bro I was stuck at 17 minutes for about an hour and a half and then it just randomly jumped to 380min.
---
nice. kicks me out and puts me in a 16k person q. shout out to blizzard
---
I could try but from what I have seen, surges are basically a death sentence without homeowners insurance surge policy
---
I came home from work, ate dinner, watched tv, spent time with my wife and dog, and am now laying in bed. I’ve played as much classic wow as everyone in this thread lmao. Y’all got punked
---
IM IN. Good luck to everyone !!
---
I got kicked from Skeram and put back in queue. omg.
---
I remember logging in after work and the queue would give me enough time to go get dinner and get my mail and would still have to wait a bit. This was normal for the high pop server I played on lol.
---
Was on Firemaw EU. Going into Undercity was the end of my All-nighter :)
---
No worries, friend. I apologize for dropping the whole "I'm an adult with a job" line, that ass-ish of me.
---
Be safe out in Azeroth!
---
everyone that was playing got punted off
---
No everyone just got DC'd lol
---
My friend group is already broken apart based on what servers we could get in. 2 of us got on a new one right after it released and others got stuck waiting some hopped on another new one that didn't have a wait. We'll see how they try to solve this shitshow.
---
Are any other servers having issues with random disconnects back to the log in? Been running fine all night in game and suddenly I'm kicked and stuck in a three hour queue :(
---
just got mine too, this sucks wtf blizz y u do dis?
---
No idea, but it was pretty bad in there. People teleporting around, barely any mobs up. If you hit a mob, you wouldn't know it until it was already dead.
---
Still in queue, 1300 atm. Sigh
---
Lol how do you even do that? It makes you type in delete
---
The problem is at least in my server the cast times had almost 1 extra second to them due to the lag so I just ended up running to mobs and tacking then with my dagger.
---
Lolol, this
---
Super love getting d/c'd and getting thrown back into the queue when I come back.
---
Nah, people just had a huge DC wave
---
Unplug the power supply and hold your power button. Then try again.
---
Same...
---
Classic blizz. Terrified of overpromising
---
same in Incend
---
barely managed that fight on the 2nd attempt, of just burning the boss down and more or less ignoring the adds.  
---
but man this group would almost struggle in a MoP dungeon.
---
Just like Classic: the TRUE vanilla port.
---
And this will be classic in a few months. Dead as any Pserver.
---
Yeah, I can understand the dilemma we now have.
---
Yeah I get it sucks I just got off work and can’t play either but I rather that than be playing on a completely empty server in about a months time. Because half the players are just tourists.
---
That sucks a bunch!
---
yeah cause they're kicking people on purpose so all you slow people "get a turn"
---
Same fucking thing happened to me....
---
I had this thought myself. Maybe they're cycling.
---
Rip server. Guess im getting dinner while i wait in queue
---
"5 minutes"
---
My routine is to get the kids fed, cleaned up and into bed around 6:30pst. It took all my Will power to log off.
---
Same, It hurt
---
Big oce f
---
This is, for some reason, so reassuring... Even if you are a streamer with a high-end viewer count, you can still get "Blizzard'd" like the rest of us
---
Blizzard did all those stress tests on servers etc expecting a heavy load......  they didn’t see this coming though, they are scrambling to bring more servers online. They were not expecting this level of influx.
---
Illidan to Blizzard: You were not prepared!
---
Please put me in his shoes. I'd love to suffer with 150k views racking in thousands from kids with too much money
---
While we're all waiting for the Q times..
---
They will be this crazy for at least a week, probably 2. 
---
I took this week off too! Partly for this game and partly for other things. 
---
Anyways just time your play times differently. Right now is 11pm EST. You have time off right? Log on 3-8 hours from now
---
On launch day, probably. If the queues persist into the week, thats when they will probably start to panic.
---
Oh god, I'll be listening to this for weeks.
---
Lol nice one
---
Same here on Incendius, I heard it was everyone in Eastern Kingdoms, no idea what happened
---
Stalagg here too, guess a few layers crashed and burned. The no d/c protection is kinda ass, 13k queue is awful for a d/c
---
Ramp in smeltery is  a tad too short, should extend to one complete revolution to be accurate ;D
---
I hope that the CEO and executives see this and realize that if they made more games like wow vanilla more people would spend money.
---
I got on at 9:30 EST, just got DC'd and put into a 8k queue on Incendius. A Medium pop server.
---
Starter edition doesn't work for classic.
---
Of course not, they're retarded.
---
Same on Stalagg some serious bullshit
---
Thanks blizz
---
Did you make sure to pick a server with low population? Didn't even see a queue once on that Nethersomething EU server across 5 reconnects this evening.
---
I've been playing on Mankrik since launch, it hasn't gone down at all.  Sorry you're getting shafted.
---
Yeah you’re definitely not remembering the same WoW general forums that I do lol.
---
i feel some sort of great satisfaction knowing the streamers got screwed too lol
---
Unlikely, I got booted after waiting in queue for hours for a single hour of play.
---
Nothing compared to human zone on faelina lol
---
Ok yeah it isnt really changing at all now at 3k
---
"His annoying bullshit" of joking about an actually dead game? WoW went to shit after they kept adding shit to appear to people like that guy. Subscription counts don't lie, people hate BFA. Just because you can group with some people still doesn't mean it isn't dead.
---
looks like everyone on Eastern Kingdom got dropped.
---
And (mostly) old content remains relevant. In later iterations of the game using catch-up mechanics, if RL circumstances forced you away from the game and a big patch drops, you're going to be more hard-pressed to see the old content you missed.
---
Not sure what you mean. You select your version in the dropdown box right above the Play button.
---
So they've opened up what, 6 or 7 more NA servers today?
---
Same here this shit fucking sucks
---
No no no, I'm committed to this. I'm waiting the long haul. Classic isn't going anywhere, I'm going to stay and I would like to stay on the server I originally chose. I'm just wondering how long it'll take before it regulates to a reasonable rate of log ins.
---
Fair and while it's riddled with loot boxes at least they're cosmetic only
---
It really was so very difficult. :( I. NEED. MORE.
---
ive noticed that the eta resets when dropping a thousand "positions" so there's a maximum eta number that maxes out, 3 numbers only i think, so the actual eta should be multiplied by every 2 or 3 thousand positions.
---
ive been down to 9min before, and then it reset back to 400 or so.
---
Happened to us on Incendius too. I waited in queue for three hours. Finally got in played for 30 minutes, disconnected back to queue for 7000+ again. I guess just be glad you got to play that long.
---
16mins lesss goooo
---
Same thing happened to me. I heard it was all players on the eastern kingdoms across all realms... not good. Now I'm in an INSANE queue. Gonna call it a night.
---
yeah but that's because it's launch
---
Lowercase works too
---
Have you encountered it yet in Classic?
---
Played for 1,30 hrs, went to bed so I could sleep 3hrs before job shift.
---
I didnt sleep, FML
---
5 hours and 11 minutes of waiting in queue so far. Pretty sick.
---
That's why tanks and healers are the best. While there are times where you can brainlessly follow the rotation, you still have to think on your feet and manage threat/mana respectively.
---
I heard they're removing people who've been playing for a while to allow others to get in who've been waiting.
---
2 hour queue? lucky. I'm in a 5 hour queue for a medium pop server
---
Obligatory I don't believe you.  Especially considering you're someone who actually knows what that means.  But if we're appealing to authority here, I'm forced to interview for our software team from time to time as well, and my reaction would be the opposite.  Hell, I've seen a lot of worse stuff on resumes.
---
Yeah, I expect it will be like this for the next few days with how popular it is!
---
Fairly sure they wanted to the people sitting in queue a chance to play.
---
Blizz just rotating the population no biggie
---
When I am casting my skills, sometimes the casting bar goes back (rollback) like 10% or more, so it takes me more time tu use the spells, is it normal since i am playing with 200ms or bc the sv is "full"?
---
Should at least quiet the idea somewhat that streamers have their own super high priority servers/layers
---
Same. on ski ramp.
---

Privilege doesn't equal money, but you're too much of a fucking moron to know these things, so I'm gonna stop bothering to reply to you until you pick up a dictionary or something and learn a thing or two
---
That’s why I moved up about 6000 spots out of no where lol....
---
My guess would be that they are letting less people in then they normally would when people are spread out.
---
"What the fuck happened to streamer privilege?"
---
Welcome to being a normal person, rat boy.
---
why in the shit does my position in queue keep going up and down?
---
I went to log in about 20 minutes ago and my queue was 12k players and 300 minutes. It was a tough decision but I got to level 7 in a few hours even with the chaotic starter zones.
---
Source?
---
Lol this is great!
---
That feel when there's more people in queue that there is on the server.
---
Except I did exactly that and got forced off along with a bunch of my friends and now we’re in that queue.
---
DAE layers kill classic?
---
Yeah same here. Guess im going to bed at a reasonable time!
---
My PvP grind is just gonna be a concerted effort to reach exalted with all the BG factions and walk away with whatever PvP rank I achieve doing that.
---
Been waiting for an hour and a half and only position 6732
---
I bet the UK players are ecstatic
---
Yep made it a point to login at 9am central time to ensure I could beat the queues and dedicated my day off to be able to binge tonight. Booted with no grace period and now 10k+ in queue.
---
AmonGOLD: https://clips.twitch.tv/HappyTubularKuduVoHiYo  
---
I don't like Asmongold. This actually made me happy.
---
What was the point of layering again?
---
Druids were only healers in classic raids for innervate. So if you plan to go healing you'll be fine, but there's not many druid spots.
---
Transfer to a server where you can keep your name or.... change your name
---
Oh my god, watching this millennial plebiscite raging over a decades old game like it is his mamma on her deathbed and he is on a red light is pure boogie.  
---
Pools Closed, Ragemonbald
---
Yeah they're cycling the queues. This wipe hit at exactly 5 hours in but on Herod we had a wipe about an hour in so I'm sure we can expect another one in 4-5 hours.
---
No people are weak willed and the majority will change their mind.
---
I couldn’t get thottbot to work, seems like you did
---
But still, you have to type it in a box that tells you it will delete the character....
---
Incendius server here. 4k queue, not terrible. Apparently all characters on Eastern Kingdoms got booted whereas Kalimdor players are fine. That's my friend's theory, anyway. He didn't get booted and he's a NE
---
Meanwhile those of us that have sat in a 5k queue for 6 hours don't mean anything apparently.
---
Pumpkin farmers in Tirisfal run when low.
---
i would sound rude, but in which country do you live? in mine, 10 usd er month can be a lot but blizzard has regional prices, i actually paid 3.12usd for my subscription. 
---
anyway, if you can't afford 10usd to play you should be worrying about other things i think
---
I was playing until my server dc’d
---
Imagine having the privilege to wait for a boat instead of waiting to play - brought to you by queue gang
---
Literally 1 million people in que
---
I live in Russian.  
---
Literally 90% of people in our country can't jeopardize 10 usd :D  
---
Teenagers can, cause they don't work and don't care.
---
Same here, layer crashed, lvl 11, in queue now
---
It looks like everyone who got kicked was in Eastern Kingdoms... is this true?
---
its pretty fair to say many people are complacent in thier jobs and are unwilling to look for something better, that or they are just too stupid to be able to get a decent job.  im pretty sure lack of will is a bigger factor alot of the time
---
There is.
---
His fingers slipped on the keyboard and typed “delete”, after his hand convulsed and the mouse clicked delete. It can happen to anyone.
---
Eastern kingdoms only got dc
---
Damn, I actually got in as soon as it opened but then the server crashed and I had to slog through a queue, got in again, got to level 8 and then the server crashed again leaving me where I am now.
---
oh hey im plasticlemon lol
---
C_CVar does not exist in classic. You want `SetCVar` instead of `C_CVar.SetCVar`.
---
yuuuup same on thalnos
---
streamer privilege btw
---
You literally make a reddit post after 5 minutes of waiting?
---
if you honestly think streamers getting ahead in queue (this would max be 1000 people globally) affects you in anyway whatsoever you're being way too petty. 
---
Streamers not being able to play the game also affects a massive amount of people watching those streams that it isnt even comparable to how little it affects regular players
---
New servers are up!
---
After the server open DC, I managed to get back into Mankirk pretty fast and have been playing for about 5 hours.
---
I heard boards and zeps aren't working
---
This is fucking stupid, started at 10k like 4 hours ago and it's still at 5k. How badly did you estimate the numbers Blizzard? OCE NEEDS more servers.

---
You realize that baby boomers are pushing 60+ years old, right? There is not a mass of 60 year olds playing this game.
---
I’m level ten and going to bed
---
Yep, was playing since launch. Got DC'd and got put in a 6k queue. I guess I'm done for the night :/ I'm not waiting 2 hours to get back in.
---
Best of luck to you! If you ever decide to join the "dark side," I've heard we have cookies.
---
There definitely is not. I was DC'd and logged back in in under 20 seconds and was put back in queue.
---
i had just killed hogger on grob and got DC'd been waiting to get back in
---
They've opened up like 8 servers in the last 6 hours. Why you do this to yourself?
---
Not to be rude, but of course Herod is fucked dude. Everyone said Herod will be fucked. Blizzard told us Herod would be fucked.
---
100+ min for 10k queue is not bad.  
---
The guy in Oceania had the same rough numbers with 700+ min queue.
---
it's a joke man. Have you never seen the boomer or zoomer memes?
---
is sulfuras EST or PST? Got characters on sulfuras and the other new one but not sure which realm is eastern
---
I saw it at 1.1m, friend said he saw 1.2m. Pretty crazy considering the game technically wasn’t even out yet
---
I was able to get into Bigglesworth about 3 minutes into launch. The UD starting area was so crowded and laggy that I barely finished a few quests before I sadly had to log off. I am not even sure I leveled past 2. After I got back home, I spent about two hours in queue before giving up.
---
Utterly ridiculous on blizzards behalf.
---
There is :D
---
If you get hit it goes back like 33% or something.
---
I remember my oldest character back then (Kimble on Aggramar, I think) having a queue in the 11000s. That's when my family decided to switch to Thunderhorn.
---
Granted, I only saw it once, and I was like eight years old, so my memory can't be great. But seeing numbers in the 10000+ definitely brings back the nostalgia. And the impatience.
---
Must be nice for life to be as easy as yours apparently has been
---
Yep. This is my life. 
---
Got in early, dc’d at level 7, and I’ve been in queue for 2h 30mins.
---
Lame.
---
Lol
---
My queue is 6.7k after about 2 hours.  It started at 18k.  Now I'm just sitting down and doing something else while waiting on it.
---
I got half through the queue and it goes &lt; 1 minute remaining and i'm like "don't give me that hope"
---
Did your IP cycle possibly?
---
I love that this is the Pirates of the Caribbean theme with a few notes changed to make it less obvious. 😂
---
same thing in Mulgore, god i missed Mulgore so much.
---
The new RPVP server is east coast! There was only a west coast one before.
---
[Had the same thing happen](https://i.imgur.com/3IZIKgy.png)
---
Afk for ~10 mins to walk my dog for a bit. D/C when I return. sadness.
---
By the by the in-universe concept of reality and its consistency wasn't violated except where mandated by gameplay necessity.
---
That's what I like about it.
---
This is why I didn't bother taking today off
---
Absolute disaster, Blizz really dropped the ball on this launch. They need way more pvp servers
---
Sub to retail wow and you get classic with it.
---
There is a grace period for DC's, if you jump right back on you'll get in.
---
My group was the only ninjas, I’m in the back tho 😂
---
Dank
---
This is true!
---
No, everyone on Incendius was DC'd.
---
Yeah, peaked at 1.2m
---
Lol he got kicked out and is still waiting yikes
---
Just DC'd off that huge Eastern Kingdoms DC, was level 12 now I am behind a 11k queue.
---
can you pay with rubles? at a discounted price?
---
Yeah, we were all really hyped that we got more people than expected. About 1/5 of our guild showed up to participate and most actually made it in on launch!
---
Doubtful

---
Same thing on Skeram. Queued up at 5:20, got in at 10, DCed an hour in when I just hit 6 and was gonna meet up with friends who were on since 6 for a Hogger rush for the staff. I got the dc but all of them somehow survived and are still playing
---
Aside from the queue, some lag, normal mob tagging issues (vanilla), I'm having a great experience!
---
Couldn't happen to a better person.
---
That's rough buddy. Get some sleep and hopefully it'll be better tomorrow.
---
Nah Azeroth Autopilot ez.
---
This is 100% not the case considering the biggest wow streamers just got dc'd.
---
Took this screenshot at 5:31 pm CST. Was a fun adventure getting over there through the empty cities and zones.
---
Straight skipped Sam's remains.
---
Same. I could give Diablo a whirl while I wait. Or I could get some work done.
---
Priorities.
---
I’m down which name you willing to give up
---
They opened up 8 unannounced ones. XD ! YuO ThINk yOU dO bUT you Don'T!
---
I went to a music festival this weekend. All these WoW players could teach the festival goers a thing or two about queues
---
I fully understand the intention if that's the case, but at least give a heads up of that intention before pulling something that massive.
---
Hahaha!! This is great!
---
You wont
---
https://imgur.com/a/Q1kmAZ4
---
Spells or melee?
---
Arugal has about 10k queue I think, the new pvp server you could probably just log into no worries
---
If you don't like playing with other players then why are you playing classic?
---
Same here. No network disruption from my end
---
Glimmer of light Holy Paladin is fun as hell, lots of fun azerite traits like Iron Jaws/Lively Spirit/Explosive potential/Festermight, several fun essences like the Overhealing dump one, Prot warrior is fun as hell, etc etc...
---
yeah my queue was 9 minutes two hours ago.
---
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
---
More of a general thing. If it's a lot longer than I recall, then yeah. I'd like to know for the future.
---
Started 5 minutes after launch and got disconnected. Go to twitch to see what’s  up and see this clown thinking it’s a targeted attack.
---
Would be really messed up to target alliance (eastern kingdoms) specifically. Doubt it was deliberate
---
But jokes are funny. :(
---
There have been multiple blue posts warning people about rolling on full servers .......
---
Once u go gnome u never go home
---
I was at 7500 after 4 hours...guess part of herod crashed because I went down to 1000 in 5 seconds.
---
Now kinda stuck around 1000...
---
Damn what’s that in wait time roughly?
---
They are FOR SURE not doing this on purpose. Their biggest streamer asmongold was just kicked and his gang. He is full tilting, pretty bad PR lol.
---
It's from the CE
---
Figured that was it, the darnassus boat doesn't seem to appear either. Well, can just bug report and move on I suppose.
---
Server issues, the real vanilla experience ;)
---
I've been going by 1000/hr
---
My server said "medium" two hours ago when I got DC'ed and tried logging back in. I'm now position 2716 with a queue that jumps from 36 minutes to 100+. It makes no fucking sense.
---
I’ve been waiting for 5.5 hours now on Fairbanks. Unreal
---
Yes, I do. There's always Hearthstone, Teamfight Tactics, so on and so forth.
---
But I've completed my Hearthstone dailies hours ago and I don't want to fire up TFT while WoW's sitting there displaying the queue. I am certain that everything would hold up just fine while multiple games run at the same time, but it's just today that I have this irrational superstitution that might disrupt things.
---
Maybe it's time to choose a different realm.
---
My buddies got to it late and were 5000 in que while I was playing. I suddenly got kicked and they called out that 3000+ people had left que and they were in, in a matter of minutes after. I gave up after 3 hours of being in que after that. Something about that situation makes me feel like that wasn't an accident.
---
Sadly every server is full/high on NA. If I wasn't lvl 11 already with friends on this server I would glady switch to one of the new ones that were just added but that wasn't an option at launch.
---
How does Blizzard "pull back" servers? Incorporate their populations into other servers?
---
and this is why in pvp we will woop dat ass
---
Ah a fortnite kid. Go back to that game and you should be getting to bed earlier!! School is starting soon!!
---
I think everyone would expect to be let back in when they already waited through the que and got in they should have gotten prio not been sent back through the que. It was Blizzards crash not like he got offline.
---
This is the funniest thing to see while also waiting in que.
---
Or Classic is just another way to cash out on WoW's franchise before the ship sinks.
---
Just passed 5 hours.
---
I’m going to bed.
---
Disappointed.
---
At this point I'd much rather be offered a free character transfer if my realm was to go extinct in the future, rather than suffering through this for a few days / weeks than this.
---
"You think you do but you don't"
---
This happened in the troll cave I. The dwarf/gnome starting zone
---
Is there a full realm list somewhere that includes time zones?  With new realms being posted that are "low pop" I'd love to know, but can't figure out their time zones.
---
Also means shadow in Latin :)
---
dog the streamer privilege thing is a joke....
---
The queue time algorithm is the same one they used to determine how many people would be playing Classic at launch.
---
Nope there are the many new servers to be waiting stupid
---
Yes, been in Que for 5+ hours. Still 2229 ahead of me. Whitemane server
---
I waited 6 hours and played 10 min then the server kicked a ton of ppl including me and I'm back at 20k
---
I’ve moved about 40 spots in 10min. Sitting at 2143
---
Guess I got my times wrong, I didn't know it was opening up today. I'm at 8500 for Grobbulus but I started at 10k+ about 10 minutes ago. 
---
Anyhow, I imagine in the next few days the wait won't be nearly as rough. Everyone is hyped to play but I've got a feeling that the numbers will drop fairly quick. Fingers crossed!
---
Yep. Mine has been estimated time 7 min ....for like an hour almost ....
---
Damn, that is brutal. f
---
Yea their should be a working grace period. Because i could see me waiting the next couple hours to get in and than get fucked over by a dc and back of the line again.
---
Pretty much. If necessary. I would like to think they wouldn't over estimate to that severe of a need,hut that is one way to go about it.
---
Had my wife log me in while I was at work, 5 hours later I'm still 3k away in the queue. So pretty good all things considered.
---
I believe you need a wow account specific to the region you're playing in, that's at least how wow worked before. That being said, idk if it's possible with classic wow. He should try changing his blizzard launcher to  US and see if he can connect. If not, he needs a US version of wow.
---
That was added in cata iirc. It's why the wetlands run was so infamous to get to Iirc tram to SW.
---
Oh a submission showing your queue taken with your phone. Very interesting and original.
---
does anyone else get serious lag issues? i can play for maybe a minute then the latency just spikes to 2k and i disconnect. it might just be my internet connection. I reset my router, everything else is working fine. Other people on the server seem to be fine.
---
Dawg that don’t change much.
---
Ah yes the old "Play the game to have fun! Unless leveling as quick as you can is fun for you, in which case you are wrong."
---
Real classy.
---
I work today, went home on my lunch break and logged right in. Got to level 4 in 40 mins. Stalag
---
Asmongold is literally losing his shit.
---
You're not the brightest star in the sky right?
---
or ya know just go up and tag the mob and give zero fucks about the line.
---
Look at the image - we were doing exactly the same (hence it doesn't "separate" us).
---
Well boys I spent 3.5 hours in queue, made a shaman and got to level 2. Today’s classic experience was better than expected it to be. See y’all tomorrow for round 2.
---
Lmfao
---
What the fuck are they watching
---
Gotcha. I was under the mistaken impression that people logged in many hours prior. But if the reality is that most people just went in around 2:30pm or so, then I should have done the same.
---
The fault lies with me.
---
yeah that sucks, I dont mind waiting but its kind of annoying not having a specific waiting time. Want to go to the gym etc xD
---
Just switch servers to ur server? Lul
---
Kinda simple solution.
---
My server was just a tab aa fest. My group got it after 2 spawns!
---
1.It depends what you mean by infinately playable, like the game has a finite amount of content, however more content gets added over time, and they'll probably release more expansions in the future. The main content is leveling to 60, doing PvP and doing dungeons and raids to gear up. The current endgame raids are Molten core and Onyxia's lair, which are relatively easy, but harder content will be released overtime, ending at Naxxramas which will give a lot of guilds a really tough time. It's unclear what they'll do after Naxxramas though. So while the game is finite, it'll last you a long long time.
---
2.Zero P2W, you just pay for sub and that's it.
---
This is entirely possible. My personal theory is that this is a test to see if there is enough life left in the game to start a new generation of sorts for WoW. Drawing in old and new players alike.
---
Gotta do something to get those views!
---
Same, 5:50p est... maybe in the next 2 hours
---
The image you sent is one of a roof...
---
80% of the submissions are just people's queue.  You tell us.
---
Why are you so upset about rolling on a pleb server that you're going through my post history and reaching wrong conclusions?  This is why nobody will remember your name.
---
there are 20 min to an hour long queues on medium pop servers
---
How many will play a priest for raiding and dungeoning alone? Trust me, there will be huge demand for that, your chat window will be filled up with whispers of invites, you will be guaranteed to have a spot in raids if you can show up on time. The down side though, is that it's gonna be bloody damn boring, you will be babysitting a bunch of idiots, and you'll have difficulty to solo.
---
o okay so you are just mad about a streamer making a joke.
---
Modern problem needs modern solution
---
Fuk this guy
---
Buy her some flowers.
---
Thank you
---
Lis that the only addon you have installed?
---
This subreddit must really hate streamers to actually think this was not a joke.
---
There were only 4 US East PVP servers going into launch, and my guild actually listened to Blizzards plea to transfer to Stalagg and now it has the biggest queue of all.
---
550 rubles = 8.32 usd  
---
Regular man with "good" job In Moscow and St. Petersburg get half of this count per hour.  
---
Truly most of us In Capital are poor people. We have living conditions in which you can't waste any money. And skimp for everything.  
---
20 km from Moscow and you literally find yourself in Third World City.  
---
Can you imagine what about other cities? We are big country, it's a long distance from capital, some people live in settlements. It's 4th and 5th World if such a thing does exist.
---
Out of curiosity, why *would* that be a bad idea? Combining a couple smaller servers into one doesn't sound like it would be a big deal for the people on the servers.
---
Cool
---
Not even close. I was just above 20k in queue with a wait of 368 min.
---
There's a 2nd pvp server or OCE now with 0 queue time
---
It doesn't matter, I was there just as long as them and got into the world INSTANTLY, I got to level 4 and my layer crashed, was instantly stuck 23k position in Herod and been there for the last 5 hours..
---
just a matter of luck staying online more then initally getting in..
---
Lok'tar for the Horde!
---
I'd be more than happy to transfer for this reason or just to help ease the overpopulation.
---
If I get in the server I'm cutting in that line
---
Amazing, 16 hour queue
---
Me and 3 others got on Incendius. Logged into about an hour before launch, clicked right away and was very impressed there was no crash. Played till about 20 mins ago when random DC came through. 
---
I was pretty impressed they pulled it off
---
Does Shazzrah have no que when other High populations are at +7k? Or is there some kind of grace period where it keeps your slot for quick relog?
---
I think I'll just play retail for the rest of the week, maybe try get on Classic early Sunday morning to beat the queues.
---
Oof. That's the worst queue number and time I've seen yet. Good luck, mate!
---
I already have a group of 15 other coworkers and friends for a guild. I shouldn't have to wait this long just to play with people I know on this server.
---
All of it will be forgotten in a few days when the queues are gone.
---
I'm 800 in queue, Only 2 more hours!
---
The grace period was working for awhile, i got dced and then instantly skipped a 16k queue due to my 5 minutes grace, but when the whole of EK got kicked i think it just broke
---
roll tank or healer and don't be a bad.  people will forget real quick.
---
No one will remember anyone’s name playing a video game. Go to bed. It’s adult time now
---
You have to wait 1 hour or more to log in to delete a toon
---
That's the same server I'm on too. I think you are probably on the verge of getting in like me.
---
My current queue is showing 1632.
---
It's been established for weeks (months?) that they would rather have queues on full servers than a huge number of half-full and quickly dead servers. 
---
Are people surprised that it actually came to pass?
---
Everyone knew it was going to be popular though
---
Nothing more fun than knowing a playerbases incessant, childish rage about “changes” (such as good server systems) ruining launch for the non-chuds who just wanna play the game and have a good time :) 
---
Why are people complaining at blizzard? There’s a reason the BFA/Legion launches were actually good. And that reason was rooted against by the mug-nostalgia minority here.
---
Just make sure your class has a trainer there
---
Stalagg is the most populated and it's the one Bliz opened up for their plea to get people to transfer to it.
---
Need a hug my dude?   
---
Take a deep breath and just calm down, it's not worth getting this salty over some twitch-streamer my dudeski
---
Having just gone through the whole Herod queue process only to be booted out 30 minutes after getting in, the way it seemed to work the past 4 hours or so is like it would barely move (like "1 in 1 out"), and then about once every 30 minutes to an hour, it would go down about 500-1000 people (assuming a DC wave or some kind of server issue).
---
If this guy truly goes to bed on stream it's going to be some avant garde masterpiece
---
when I queued for Bigglesworth it was medium population.  now it is high and I am still queued.
---
Did not know that!
---
So I like many others jumped ship to Kirtonos or Rattlegore. Was this a good idea? Are these servers gonna be “dead” before not too long? I’m kinda worried about my decision.
---
That’s a great point honestly!
---
Right click on your own avatar &gt; loot options
---
imagine spending your free time watching asmongold lol
---
Of all the servers I picked the worst Fucking one.
---
I will.
---
Has there been any word on how long for?
---
Have faith!!
---
Heheh I would do that, and that's a good point too, but the only thing holding me back from doing exactly that(and just restarting on my original server tomorrow or something) is because I came to this one because of a friend.
---
And in turn I've asked another friend to reserve their character on this one. So I were to suddenly go server hopping...yeah I'd rather not.
---
Would love to experience this again but I have been in the queue for login for the past 2 hours....
---
Alright, Blizz, I'll go to bed...
---
Here it is. The correct meme for these queue "estimates"
---
Anyone know if there is a discord for Sulfuras yet?
---
To be fair, he's acting like a child, and you would be too if that was your reaction level to something this minor.
---
It's just a game, and it's not like he can't get back in forever.
---
I'd just hit the sack early and start again in the AM.
---
You're a saint
---
Arugal chat didn’t even work until 10 minutes into the launch!
---
Right click your frame, and change under loot option from group loot to free for all
---
I did my part and logged out. Got lvl 10 in 6 hrs.  Next goal is to get to 15 tmrw maybe in 6 more hours. Then heal dead mines until 20
---
Imagine being this smug and condescending when you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
That's the plan, but I'm also scared of the high pop servers staying wildly overpopulated. At this point though I'd rather risk queues for the life of classic and a guaranteed healthy server pop than rolling somewhere else and the server collapse into a few guilds once Naxx rolls around and all the best geared people get leeched.
---
He’s witty and funny imo. Has a good personality, streams a lot.
---
Raids dont go away, tho they dont scale, gear in it will still be lvl 60 for exemple if its a vanilla raid.
---
And yes, most streamers are on the server
---
How about bigglesworth? Anyone know the current queue time?
---
Please throw it up on a website!
---
I heard 15 mins, have not found a source tho.

Im quite sure that it paid for itself entirely from just new subscriptions in the last 24 hours. If that's true, then it's already successful from their point of view.

Going to try and get out of the queue, re-queue, sleep, and hope it took as long as the first one so I can get a decent night in.
---
Have Faith and Blizzard will bless our wishes for more servers!
---
Lotta people got randomly DC’ed too
---
The EU Servers all have massive queues. 3+ hours.
---
Money.

for someone who doesn't like asmongold you sure seem to be posting a lot about him 🤔

I personally wasn’t aware, is all. I’m not going to try to sell, I was just curious as to how many names I can grab on the new servers. I’m considering just deleting this post, since it’s looking like it’s not gonna gather anything positive from anyone XD
---
Yeah, I'd rather suffer now and have medium-heavy servers down the road than get into a server instantly and have it die after I hit 40.

its not much, but its honest work
---
I got to level 9 and got disconnected. feelsbadman
---
While I admit that Blizzard screwed up launch hardcore (though come on it’s Blizzard... did you REALLY not see this coming...) layering in no way solves an server overload issue... The server can only handle so much bandwidth through put. Once it hits it’s limits that’s all it can give. Layering improves game experience not hardware load...
---
If you are playing on Herod then you were warned.... Alot...
---
It's as casual or as serious as you want it to be you'll have fun with either approach
---
I figured it was implied he has to make an NA account.
---
I don’t think any are “low.” They all have a few thousand or more queue.
---
Classically reminds you of windows 95 time estimates.
---
1 hour before launch on vanilla.. you lucky turd.. i didn't get in until almost 2am pst... wouldnt change it for a thing though because I had friends with me.... if I was alone in a basement though... boy would i let them have it on reddit
---
I love playing casual. End game can mean a few different things to someone. For me I love goooollllddddd. Some people love raids. Some people love pvp. I for one maybe have a 4 hours every couple of days to play and will be playing casually. This game is a ton of fun and really has something for every type of player. If you have $15 laying around and a computer from the last 10 years. Give it a shot.
---
I've been sitting in queue for 5 hours now lol and probably still have a few hours left to go
---
Np, have fun tonight!
---
Has anyone seen a blue post regarding server transfers?
---
I'm thinking to jump onto one of the fresh realms to save myself the queue times however my concern is that I will be stick on a low pop dead server in a few months time.
---
I'm in oceanic so I only have two pvp realms to choose from
---
EU servers are down
---
shame people don't know hes acting
---
Dude, I feel that. I left my laptop on the bus on Wednesday. Managed to work something out and I’m 3283rd in queue for Whitemane now.
---
Oh snap, I’ve failed you reddit. Maybe I should go to bed, the queue might be up by then haha

---
Just wait.. it's only been live for 6 hours lol.. 1/4 of a day! By middle of September you'll never see a queue again. It's worth it.
---
Same, It went really well for me. I didn't have to wait in queue and I connected as soon as the world opened. The server was a bit laggy and tagging mobs was hard but I got to lvl 5 and it was fun. I got disconnected with half of EU and then I went to sleep since it was late. Wow classic is massive.
---
Very bad for the game to see server issues, lag and crazy queue times. They should act and offer character transfers and add more servers.
---
You seem awfully defensive about some guy online that broadcasts video games and whose hairline has officially said fuck it.
---
What was the reason?
---
What's a good NA east coast server. 🤔
---
Lol I’m going to bed. Will play in the morning. Servers restarting at 10m est tho
---
everytime a mob dies my screen freezes for like 0.5sec, any idea what is this? my game is running just fine with 100+ fps
---
I just got a message pop up with music playing that said "what does this do" is that a random event or something?
---
My first time in MC was with a group of 37, and a couple were cybering and pretending to play. We wiped on the first giant and basically stalled for an hour while people pulled their heads out of their asses.  I eventually got a partial T1 set though.
---
It was kind of exhilarating being a part of the first small wave to reach Ironforge. Have never seen the city so empty. Was also the first to hug the man fishing beside the bridge into Stormwind. I'm practically a legend in these parts.
---
Got to lvl 11 before east shut down now in 2 hour que QQ RIP lol
---
The kiddies limited by Parental controls must have just logged off at Midnight, I just made a decent queue jump after the Eastern Kingdoms crash.

Ohhh so if there’s a level cap increase gear from that raid will stay at 60? And is everyone’s rush to be the first to clear the raid just for personal achievement?
---
well it was "completely false"
---
If you mean Arugal, I'm in queue just after you. Exactly the se situation. I just think people aren't logging out
---
Also i don't know why it shows BFA breaking news on the classic client

I put in a ticket yesterday.  They have an EU account waiting for me to transfer my sub from my US one.  Deciding whether to pull the trigger though.  EU works great with my work schedule but...
---
I dont feel like you're made for college if you feel its that demanding.
---
No offense but i saw a bunch of kids in classes that were struggling to keep up with the basics, and it just felt like they should've gone to a trade school or something.

Is it for an hour?
---
Yeah, it's to apply a fix to boats/zeppelins bugging out on certain layers according to their twitter.
---
Welp, there goes my plan to start the queue before I leave for work in the morning... :(
---
Reminder that Blizzard knows better than you, engineers know better than you, etc.
---
I wish our server did this to get Whitebeard's Journal from Grik'nir the Cold. Everyone clumped in a circle and insta-killed him, then seemed confused when nobody could click him to loot him.

You have to sub first to get the option to DL classic.

U will kneel to the power of the Que and take it like a man AND U WILL LOVE IT!

Any idea how long the servers are going to be down for?
---
Between the Queues, the getting kicked off and relogging etc. I must have waited about 6 hours. I was on for no more than 3 minutes before I was removed again. 
---
Ouch.
---
Pog!
---
99% sure they added layers so people can actually quest. More than likely will remove them with time when people spread out a bit from starting zones

Yeah it was just dinged 11 lvl with my rogue.

Sit in queue all night, finally get in, server shutdown 15:00.

Blizzard: Medium servers are as large as full servers were back in the day
---
All servers: High to full capacity
---
Also Blizzard: Can't make any more servers because we don't want empty servers
---
You are emulating the classic experience well by using a potato for a computer. Good work.
---
We're just stating the obvious here and it's okay, no one is saying their evil. They would probably be the first to admit they should have opened more 2 or so weeks ago after the events of today.
---

Nah i just have a 14k que position
---
Was in queue for 4 hours, lost connection,got put to the back of the line for another 4+.
---
Where are you getting this information from?
---
There are plenty of servers without a queue now.
---
Blizzard warned about realms being full would create MASSIVE queues. You can't feel cheated, when you got warned OVER, and OVER and OVER again.
---
I'm hoping that doesn't happen
---
This thread can't be real with that opening line.
---
They didn't?
---
thanks for the Vietnam flashbacks
---
Yeah the time isn’t as important as the number I’ve seen.
---
God speed friend
---
If you don't want problems, don't play on day 1 in a complex game such as an MMO. You can just wait a couple of days for the problems to be fixed.
---
I got into Shwzzrah after restart but cant see chars, nor log in, any1 else?
---
You kinda missed the point and the objective of a laptop...
---
How can you expect any updates from a small indie company?
---
I know it sucks to not be able to play, but when did Blizz ever launch something with without issues like hours of queue/disconnects/errors etc? This launch has been completely as I excepted (1 hour of play, dc, 5 hours of queue, then server shutdown).
---
yes, the world server is down bro
---
The first thing that comes in mind is turkey. It is very very annoying to find here. I always struggle to find turkey. I just replace it with chicken.

Known issue. Don’t think they’ve commented further.
---
RIP mate, I've got my cock out so you can hopefully rock out sooner rather than later.
---
Yeah it looks like they shut the servers down, but don't know how long. I was playing and it did a countdown saying "shutdown in ____ minutes"
---
turn down your gamma
---
The change is actually a benefit in really rare cases, you can loot at least 2 swift mounts in the game via ZG and ride them for 100g max.

---
welcome to wow queues, where numbers mean nothing, and estimated times are useless
---
Nice! When I got off level 13 was the highest with about 5 people.
---
You keep your spot for an unknown period of time. I'm trying to actively lose mine so I can re-queue and sleep (so I can wake up in time for normal queue).

If you want a server without a queue, go to smolderweb, sulfras, or deviate delight

hope they add a few  more layers to each server while they are at it

should have picked the server that will later be dead instead /s

Are you on Bigglesworth, or was this happening multiple servers?

You may think you want it but you actually don't, indeed.

Sulfras, smolderweb, deviate delight. No queues there friend

Update: at position 4755 and est 75 minutes

Yeah everyone was in groups

Yes. I was ahead of 99% of the swarm. Now I'm 5 lvls behind the lead.

Get the first one. The CPU is better and it has 8GB if RAM vs 6. 
---
But bare in mind you’ll be turning the quality settings down even for classic, these are integrated GPUs. 
---
If I were you I’d trawl Kajiji or Facebook Marketplace for a second hand laptop, preferably one with a dedicated GPU.
---
Every single mmo launch in history more like it.
---
Thank you for the response. Which of these two do you think is better, if even only slightly.
---
Yea, but after the servers restarted I got in but not able to load into the world
---
I'm hoping waiting instead of re-logging in pays off lmao. I'm just hoping that the fact that we're still in queue is a good sign...?
---
But who's the tank....
---
Nope, it loads in to a "world server down" in character select
---
so everything is fine, congrats, screw everyone else right?
---
omniCC not working on classic, should i download somethign different? what is there? or wait for it to be updated
---
Got my chars, but loading screen into "world server is down" constantly.
---
World server is down. Classic servers are fucky atm, hopefully will get fixed soon.
---
He’s joking... you’re he only clown here.
---
Same goes for Smolderweb and Deviate delight at the moment
---
Which of these two do you think might be better?
---
Go with the ASUS. The graphics card is better and a SSD hard drive with make it boot up quickly. Will run classic just fine and should run any school program you need (unless you're using photoshop or video editing)

They probably switched from counting created characters to ones that had logged in.

world server down, but I see the chars

My friend has the same. Black log in screen and button
---
There's a little dropdown above the play button that has the options for "World of Warcraft" and "World of Warcraft Classic".
---
You want the latter.
---
Are you really insulted by server issues, on launch day? It's not like it benefits blizzard that their servers are crashing.
---
I'm playing on a 2013 15" MacBook Pro and it's quite jittery at times.
---
To everyone complaining about severe queues (at least on EU) - BLIZZARD warned you plenty of times. Noggenfogger is smooth AF.
---
I got in right as the servers opened and although it was insanely crowded at first, now that I'm at Darkshore it is substantially less crowded.
---
You're right. However, if you want to be able to play at a gf's house, parents house, side chicks house, church, school, work, starbucks, etc., laptop it is.
---
YOU DONT SAY
---
Reinstall?
---
Dick out and F
---
Not even changing to instant quest text? You are truly a masochist.
---
Slept for 2 hours, then I woke up at 2325 local. Logged right in had a 1500 person que and got in AT launch. Played until 0430, up for work at 0530. My dad tried to log in at launch, 15k+ que. got to level 2 lol before bed.
---
The time sink to even reach max level is huge and then you're looking at another huge time sink to gear and attend raids.
---
So TBH if you're pushed for time I would not recommend CWoW. By all means, give it a go but it's a game that requires a lot of time and patience before you get the pay off!
---
Apart from 5 unsuccesful logins because the world server was down there was no queue on EU Mirage Raceway realm and the whole thing went great.
---
This is what happens when people HAVE to go to that specific server where even Blizzard said they would experience severe queues because it's completely full.
---
Guess I'll level my character in peace and get a free transfer away in a couple of months.
---
4 hour queues are *real*
---
Maybe I should go for it after correctly proclaiming that there were in fact too few servers 2 weeks ago. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
My experience has been really, really awesome. I haven't tried to go to any capital cities (mainly because I didn't level enough to need to yet. I had to log off due to a crazy storm in my area. My "Full" server went to "Medium" after a few hours, layering worked wonderfully. The first few minutes had a little lag, but I also spent the first five minutes after the button turned on running to a different starting area.
---
I'm rambling.
---
Have not tried this will do
---
Is your harddrive full?
---
sleep? world server is still down
---
They're back up again
---
I did it the other way around Dorf to NE
---
Nice
---
Does this mean I can get trained for epic at 100g, and then wait until the new mount systems kick in, and get the actual mount for another 100g?
---
I agree the leveling really was great. I hope the numbers stay up and it's remains popular.
---
Thats true, same for me, which was why i said almost every lol. But I fully expected this launch to be the current shitshow it is with how much hype there was all over the place and how many people planned on playing.

Go look around Reddit for 5 minutes and you’ll see plenty of people who queued in early to get kicked out... stop being a dolt.

The USA LMAO.  Cox became a bunch of...  Cox suckers.

They literally keep adding additional servers so I’m not sure your hypothesis is correct
---
&gt;We didn't experience any lag that we noticed... Should we restart on a NA server? Any advice would be lovely.

might as well whilst your low level, if you're not an english realm then definitely change

I believe they announced Classic would now be included in the maintenance window.

I agree, this will suck for the first week or so but will help promote some longevity in server population
---
This is totally wrong, you're confusing "bandwidth" with "data used". Modern broadband just start popping up in 2010, and it's only 4 Mbps. The people you're replying to are talking about bandwidth, not monthly data limit.
---
There are servers that are low and medium pop that won't be as bad.  I am sure after the initial opening week dies down they will start offering server transfers as well from the higher pop to lower pop realms. This is a side effect of not having sharding and temporary queues are a much better solution.

Don't tell me what to do.

How's it been so far?

It's an issue when there are 50,000 people still on a server so they can't remove all the layers...

Try to Log in with another character and Switch their positions in the Login screen

Got any suggestions for addons to get?
---
Go grind mobs, no need to stand in line
---
nope. Still in queue around 300. The original time you got is about accurate, honestly. I got around 450 minutes, and its about to be my 7th hour.
---
I know the pain, it’s now 6am, I should have queued and gone to sleep
---
This isn't retail. You don't have to play on a Full server just to see people (and even then, most are cross-realm). Blizzard has stated that Low pop servers have more people than the fullest vanilla realms in 2004.
---
you care enough to comment tho lol
---
You were actually right, got in before the queue and not a single DC
---
I think it's strategic releases. They are releasing 3 new ones instead of 10 when 10 would easily get rid of all queues.
---
Warrior is the only tank.
---
Pros for each race:
---
Orc - 5? xtra weapon skill with axes which makes hitting the hit/parry cap vs end game bosses easier.
---
Tauren - 5%? HP bonus; Speaks for itself. 
---
Undead - Will of the Forsaken. Good as an extra CC break (esp Fear which can also be pre-empted with stance dancing plus zerker rage)
---
Just got in on EU Gehennas with no queue after 15 min of world down
---
My friend and I crashed same time as this. I'm still waiting in que - 1.5 hr later i'm at 11583...
---
I just left my lunch break and started the queue. Get back home at 5pmAEST. Hopefully leaving it for three hours gets me there
---
Does GPU matter? The other one has alot better GPU.
---
Hooray lines! We did this in Org on Bloodsail as well. Always nice to see people handling things civilly. :3
---
Damn man, sounds like a server or connection problem then.  All part of the launch chaos, sorry I couldn't help
---
By the time the queue is done I'll have superpowers.
---
Fairbanks actually.  And many people decided what realm to play on with their friends when the original servers were announced with name reservations and all, so not exactly easy to just switch servers when 4 of my other friends were able to log on 30 minutes before the go-live time and have been playing the past 6 hours.  Just a shitty experience unfortunately.  I guess at the end of the day WoW Classic is a marathon and not a sprint, but it would have been nice to be able to participate in the launch day festivities :/
---
They are super similar, so it probably won’t make the most difference, but I would go for the second one I think. 
---
It has slightly less ram, but a faster cpu. The gpus are neck and neck specs wise. 
---
If there’s anything you like more about the first one features wise over the second though, it’ll due roughly the same job.
---
honestly i had reserved names on gehennas but after seeing the queue time i decided to move to a low pop realm... i think all realms will develop healthy population, you shouldn't worry about it
---
That's what was expected for a Streamer server, I'd presume. Also, the servers went down about 3 hours in, so wasnt much playtime, BUT I WANT MORE.
---
damn im  at 300 im really hoping that doesnt happen
---
Leveling is infinitely easier as swords/maces compared to daggers since you can't get behind mobs to backstab them without gouging them. At 60 I preferred dagger over combat swords though, so I'll probably just switch specs when I get close to 60 and can stealth farm a barman shanker in BRD.
---

So you decided to wait until now to ask for help? ever heard about google my dude?

---
AP only helps with white and SoC dmg, nothing else. And having MAna is more important than a bit of AP. 
---
So your reason for not picking guardians favor, a.k.a. the most essential pvp talent there is, to the point, that any paladin spec without it can be considered at best average, is that it's a pvp spec.
---
I really don't see your reasoning. You don't pick PoJ, because you can get kited anyway. Yes, but it helps and you'll get kited even harder without it. A movement speed increase is mandatory as everybody else will have minor speed on their boots, so they can just outrun you if you don't have PoJ.
---
You don't pick Guardian's favor, because you fear it gets dispelled. No matter, that there are only two classes, which can dispel it and only of those has a slow anyway, which you might as well just dispel. The slow/immobilize immunity is crucial when fighting several classes who can't dispel it (running rogues/warriors, hunters, druids, mages).

DESGUSTAAAAANG!

That queue is a mess, just compare it to the civilised horde queues

Lol I had to buy some vender ones.... before I got d.c to 7000 que
---
I have no idea hey, I chose arugal first cos I wanna be on a busy server and it was also only one of 2 that was ther when I made my character
---
I got into Bigglesworth with a 15 minute queue at launch. I logged to put my daughter to sleep, came back 30 mins later to a 12k queue. Still sitting in it after over three hours. 1638 ahead of me now.
---
Conversely not many total druids and very low competition for gear whenever you’re in group
---
Lol, everyone (including Blizzard) knew, and warned everyone for weeks now that there would be long server queues. Stop your bitchin
---
My server tried to start a queue until we all laughed at them and proceeded in chaos to enact survival of the fittest in real time
---
If you leave the screen up in the queue and walk away will it stay or do you get kicked for inactivity if say, you don't move your mouse or keyboard.
---
All good, was just wondering if anyone else had that issue.
---
damn dude you can't just do a man dirty like that.
---
Mate its almost impossible to know and blizzard would have professionals trying to gauge it and even they wouldn't know. Early interest is huge and there will be a drop off but its hard to forecast when this will happen. Its possible in a months time this new pvp server is dead and gets merged to arugal. Its also possible both continue to exist for a few years. 
---
A lot will depend on how blizzard maintain player engagement and interest when the nostalgia and the novelty is gone.

Kids these days huh...
---
Yours is so peaceful
---
It’s good but you only need one for the blessing compared to 8 shamans for totems
---
you have to consider classic didnt exactly reach at a peak time for us europians, with a 11pm-1am launch, I'd keep to your server until tomorrow night or even a few days from now, I'd imagine the playerbase will grow substantially by tomorrow evening!
---
Had to do this like 5 times in ironforge.
---
R u okay
---
Thalnos here, i waited 3 hours, when i was at 500 my guild started to say that we should change to bigglesworth,  reached lvl 6 with my priest, then the game kicked me and left me in 18k qq  
---
Now im 5675 qq on Bigglesworth
---
Queue jumpers?
---
From most important to optional:
---
-Questie
---
-Dominos
---
-OmniCC
---
-WeaponSwingTimer
---
I crashed with them on faerlina still in que - 11480 people with 200+ est wait time
---
BB has been doing this
---
How does trickling in that same playerbase change the end result? The only thing that would solve the problem u bring up is an actual hard cap on server character creates. Which they said they wouldn't do. So what's their plan. Make people miserable enough to sit in a queue to quit so they can remove layers later. That just doesnt make sense to me personally
---
Booooooo
---
Either you're on an empty server or a dirty liar
---
Hope I can log on and play tomorrow
---
Do you work for blizzard? I think you grossly underestimate how good classic is.
---
EU Golemagg working
---
Way ahead of you.
---
I wasn't when I was online, got DCd about 3 hrs ago and have been in que since lol
---
Good job I waited 4 hours from 23k to 450
---
except they had to shrink to 12/7nm to hang out with intels 14nm. right now thats a good thing for consumers to get better priced parts, once intel gets to 7nm AMD is gonna have nowhere to go. we've all bitched and moaned about intel refreshing 14nm, but they HAVE squeezed almost every bit of performance out of that lithography size, and i dare say they will take what the learned forward into 7nm and 5nm and just blast amd away.
---
In wrath I lvld a paladin with the name Assmolester to lvl 65 before I got a free name change
---
Take a deep breath my dude, it's just a game.   
---
Maybe do something productive in the meantime? Learn a new skill or clean your apartment?   
---
Who knows, maybe you'll grow as a human?
---
If that's actually happening, I'm kinda okay with it for launch day, I got to play for a solid 5-6 hours and I got kicked twice, first time wasnt bad but the second time was a 4 hour queue at 10pm ish
---
I'll just wake up early tomorrow and let people play tonight
---
I'm so happy someone else did it :)

I started queue 15min ago and says 57min wait...
---
PREACH
---
I WANT TO GET OFF MR BONES WILD RIDE!
---
You have to learn swords in stormwind
---
Stalagg... sigh
---
This is exactly the opposite to vanilla/ classic wow. They might as well reinstate lfr if they do that.
---
Did u have to sit through queue again?
---
They’re down won’t be up till world reset
---
This is my favorite meme of all time.
---
Money? Are you fucking stupid?
---
Then every WoW expansion is successful and there hasn't been a bad one yet as they all pull big launch numbers.
---
Was this taken just now? 👀
---
How long until after my queue is ready do I have to log in? If it's finally my turn, and I don't log in, will it kick me out?
---
#rip been in queue for 5 hours now. Herod.
---
I would love to be the first gnome to make it to darnassus.  people will look like you are from another world :D
---
Orange arrow bad give me orange arrow
---
almost 5 hours in queue now and I'm still over 10k.
---
All that for a drop in queue..
---
I didn’t see that, on my server they were all a bunch of savages.  All try to get it first.
---
Lol RIP gnight
---
I supposedly have 2 minutes left but it keeps shooting up to 60 minutes. After 300 minutes so far, I have no nuts left for towels.
---
I took it around 8:45 pm EST
---
But this simply isn't true. Can you do all questing and menial tasks solo? Yeah, but so can quite a few classes in classic bar high elite quests. Other than that, Raids, dungeons and pvp are still as social as ever and you need other people.
---
Their reason was they didn't want dead servers in a month when the game died down a little you fucking troglodyte.
---
No because he punched a hole through his screen
---
Finally got in after almost 7 hours. Afkd too long and got kicked lmao. Till the next time friendos
---
I thought that was just EU?
---
same, started at 24k and now at 13k. considering just sleeping now and waking up in-time hopefully

---
Server caps are 12k according to some sources, so youre really not ever gonna get in if like 9-10k people wont log off to not lose their spot.
---
yup. If i roll NE im going to westfall no question
---
I mean incendius opened at noon today and by 6pm was full with a 7hr queue so yeah I’d say they’ll fill up 😂
---
when does school start?
---
How could they not anticipate this and have quest item instant respawning?
---
Haha, ölögat har sällan fel ;)   
---
Vilken server lirar ni på?
---
Yeah all of EK crashes on Stalagg around the time he got kicked.
---
Lucky enough to have no queue on Westfall. My other party member wondered what the hell happened.
---
When I was logged on earlier, I noticed all my windows (loot, character,ect) were on the left of my screen and couldn't be moved. How do I adjust them?
---
You need to visit weapon trainers in main cities to learn specific weapons such as swords and maces. Look up online where the ones are located you need but from memory the SW Trainer and teach you swords and I think you’ll need to head to IF for maces 
---
Ps. They cost 10s each 
---
PPS. Welcome to classic
---
Rogues do use swords.  Combat sword rogues is regarded as their best DPS spec for raids.  As others have said, you just need to train in it at a weapon master in SW
---
My HP laptop required being stacked on a set of books with multiple box fans cooling it and still would overheat on vanilla Wow. I was not prepared...
---
Stalagg, here is 5 hours ago. [https://i.imgur.com/Xv8pWA1.png](https://i.imgur.com/Xv8pWA1.png)
---
I joined queue at 3:15PM at 26k. It's now 10PM and I'm at 6400.
---
Apparently they (he and his old crew) jumped to one of the new servers 🤞🏼 I’m afraid to go in there.
---
If you're in queue, you can leave. Once you connect to character select, I believe it's a 20 min timeout.
---
Phew you had me worried.
---
Dunno whether you're talking about the time I spent playing or the queue, lol.
---
For the former - I mean, yeah, fun. Lots of people tagging mobs/nodes/etc., so it's hard, but fun.
---
For the latter... it's slow. I've been queued for a little over 2 hours now and it's gone down from 10,380 to 7,416.
---
Niiiice
---
Plus I think that as people get fed up with queue times and switch servers the player distribution will even itself out naturally
---
I took out my processor and sold it on eBay lol. New one should be here Wednesday. Maybe I can play by then...
---
There is a new oce pvp server now
---
Sitting at 5400 in queue for Herod.  Started at 25,551.
---
same, just waiting for all the kids to logoff go to bed, should be right about now
---
And they also had way more servers for BfA
---
Thank you very much for the response. A few people have told me to go with the asus but when I compare the graphics card and processor on this site here it says the acer laptop is superior. I am confused.

I'm running classic WoW on my 5 year old ThinkPad with Intel HD graphics at 1080p. Lol
---
Alliance på flamelash! Tänkte köra Shazzrah först men orkade inte sitta i kö. Var spelar du?
---
U can do that on windows too.....
---
Nahhh
---
&gt;...then it's a clone of literally every action RPG on mobile. 
---
It's almost like mobile RPG are uninspired trash mass produced for a quick buck and Blizzard isn't gonna do it any differently...
---
Now it just needs to happen again and I can finally log in for five minutes then go to bed!
---
wish i knew, i logged on at 540est and have been in the queue since.  1am here now
---
Agreed!
---
After training 1h sword, go Combat sword spec.
---
Broke boi
---
If true, log him out and start a new character.  That will be funny later.
---
r/BiggleBois
---
Ive been in a 7 hour queue, still haven't gotten in.
---
Asmon currently the most watched channel on twitch and he’s literally just sleeping haha
---
409. Let's ride brother.
---
I know its only been a few hours but is it worth starting? I've never played back in the days but from what I saw on screenshots it looks like a ton of fun (people forming lines for quests etc)
---
Think a bit longer and it will start making sense.    It's the middle ground between black and white  (no layers and infinite layers)

---
Can confirm, playing Alliance, it's a free-for-all
---
Somehow i do not think these DC where random. It just so happened the longest logged in players all got kicked....
---
Legion still had all the bullshit BFA has, though. Cross-realm everything, teleport everywhere, braindead levelling and dungeons, transmogs, silly mounts etc. I don't think retail can ever be saved unless they soft reboot it completely.
---
how though
---
i've been in arugal queue since 9am and moved from 9k to 3k. you're unlikely to be able to play at all tonight.
---
Well we are at 29 US/OCE servers now so that didn't work out
---
Must be nice, I started at 27k
---
Got into Bigglesworth with a 15 min queue at launch, left for 30 mins to put my daughter to bed, came back to a 12k queue. Been sitting in it for over three hours, "only" 740 left ahead of me.
---
I was there, I kept trying to get people into a line but nobody listened 😭
---
Not very vanilla like. Back then ppl just ganked the mobs in huge groups
---
Been in queue for 5 hours, sitting at about 3k. Gonna go to be likely as soon as I log in.
---
Lol wtf dude
---
That is such bullshit. The odds of damaging your system from static electricity from a vaccuum cleaner are lower than simply using your laptop on your lap.
---
If you're a computer repair shop obviously you'd wouldn't do that. But most people don't have a can of compressed air lying around and it sure as hell beats having your PC get damaged from heat.
---
Fucking reddit...

Fuck

Just get bartender or one of the many like that imo, it works the same way as ff14's layout editor you can just click and drag things around.

It's amazing how hyped I was all day at work, and still haven't ding'd once...

This was a US server. Sounds like your realm is full of uncivilized savages.
---
Yeah not going to happen.  Blizz is doing server maintenance in nine hours, trying to log in immediately after maintenance is probably your best bet (no idea what time that is for you).
---
I wouldn't say constant queues yet. It's been less than a day since release.  
---
Launch for just about every MMO will have long queues, disconnects, etc. It'll take a few days before things stabilize and then we can really see if the queues are horrible.
---
Rolled to rattlegore too. Up to a 2 hour wait now
---
i think ppl are, in a lot of places.  The good thing is there's both an individual and crowd incentive to be in a group so it tends to happen.
---
sTrEAmeR PriViLEge

It's the American way frankly.  It's the same denial with 99.9% of our systemic problems.  Too many bootlickers.
---
I'm interested and I am thinking of leveling a priest for healing and a hunter for DPS roles. Should I PM you?
---
Faerlina will forever be scarred, as it is the streamer server. It will always be trying to be connected to.
---
No layering is so they don’t have to have 100 servers to accommodate launch pop, then 20-30 dead servers when people leave/stop playing as much.
---
This is my plastic fork?
---
[Oh, no...](https://i.imgur.com/YUYZyhd.jpg)
---
It’s cool man ques are fucking insane get that bread
---
almost feel bad for him
---
almost
---
Yeah mine said 35 min. God I dont hope that is true. I'm gonna start my queue then go to school so when I get home I can play. I'm just hoping it doesn't turn into a 10 min queue so I get logged out before I can get home.
---
Yeah, Westfall is a US server. We used to have mad scrambles, but that was only for wolves at the very beginning.
---
Well it's 3pm here now and my old self struggles past midnight nowadays so I don't like my chances
---
Meet my boarletics, after  you eat it
---
I equipped a random 1h I had due to faster attack speed O.o
---
They actually made him the CEO of Blizzard lol
---
Maybe next week bud
---
These lines where everywhere. Its amazing too see.
---
Maybe its the cause of wow classic mainly being populated with mature ppl.
---
I certainly never Saw any lines back in vanilla.
---
J. Allen Brack was the person who said that and he is now the President of Blizzard.
---
I am sure we will get a launch day response from the devs about what happened today.
---
I am betting about 2 million people tried to play today and about 750k succeeded.
---
We don't know when paid transfers will become available, coulds be months.
---
I tbhink all they said is they would release transfers to eleviate full servers, and that will ptobably only be free transfers from high/full to medium/low.
---
He has stated that he regret saying that a lot and he was infact very engaged in classic wow
---
He's now the president of Blizzard Entertainment, lol.
---
Because you couldn't find a store that had it in stock it was sold out everywhere.
---
Theres alot more players right now. Vanilla wow had like 400k or something at launch. A medium realm now is equal to a full realm back then. So a full realm now is insane. All the servers are full. Even the new ones they made today.
---
But they don't
---
I'm on there. Plan on staying.
---
Wait to brag until we see how many players we maintain guy, ofc theres going to be a bunch of people wanting to try it out but after about a month there will be a pretty massive drop in players. I'm not even saying this guy was right, but still.
---
Don't be silly, that will never work.
---
What he needs to do is insert his credit card into the floppy drive.
---
My feelings exactly
---
Just 32 hours ? &gt;laugh In RuneScape
---
Classy folks! Never have I seen something like this first hand. Always an "every man for himself" situation.
---
He apologized and is partly responsible for bringing the game back.
---
Everyone do mistakes, can't really blame people that they don't realize some stuff immediately.
---
Welcome to every game launch ever. Looks like we have a first timer over here LoL
---
Meanwhile I moved to westfall because it said Pagle was full. Now Pagle is medium and westfall is low.  Wtf.  How hard is it to get in a high pop server with reasonable queues... I know it's launch but they completely booked this and now me and my friends are gonna be stuck in a server that will be dead in 2 months.
---
Because you think you want it. But you don't
---
i logged in at 3pm EST and sat on the loading screen for 3 hours before launch so i could load in on time, my friend who logged in 30mins before launch got hit with a "2 hour" queue, i hit lvl 10 made a guild and logged off to to sleep, as far as i know hes still in queue
---
Yes
---
I managed to get on just now. much nostalgia! WOW!
---
B-b-but layering ruins the immersion and makes it feel like a dead game!
---
haven't subbed yet, gonna wait out the crowd while i adjust to the new semester. is it free to start a guild right now? i feel like i remember a charter costing like a gold which most people wouldn't have for a decent chunk of time

Time for our own wall of nope!
---
why didn't you just made the subscription payment online?
---
just curious.
---
My point isn't that retail is something most of this subreddit would enjoy. I like retail, even BFA. Classics success is unrelated to retail being enjoyable. 
---
It's not "humiliating for Blizzard's designers" that two different games are both popular.
---
It has just been released to App Store! :)
---
WTF.
---
why is firemaw the EU server with *the longest* queue??? golemagg didnt even have a queue at all.
---
He literally said "what the fuck happened to streamer privilege" like 5 seconds after this lmao
---
That's what those surveys are for
---
Its on App Store now! :)
---
Yeah, you will probably have to roll on one of the new 8 servers they opened
---
I logged on kromcrush, in about 25 mins total, about 1.5 hrs after launch.  Zero queue right now.
---
I made eggs and bacon. It was done 10min before launch. It was perfect. Thank you blizzard for letting me relive one of my greatest gaming memories ever.
---
Lmao my boss knows full well that I'm going to be sleepy tomorrow
---
Now if I can just get on...
---
 I saw him at 290k. Chat kept saying he went over 300k too which is absurd
---
I walked inside, saw est. 5 minutes lost my whole shit,  then 15 seconds later it went back to 157 min....... and I shit you not as I was typing this I went from 4 min...to 127.... to 34... to 110...   :(
---
My brother talked me into it just today since we live in different states. I'm staring at 90 minites for medium and 200+ for high pop server queues.
---
Fun times lol. I am glad for you, though I'm super disappointed in Blizzard yet again on release.
---
I don't watch streamers.  I love to see this here though!  Look at his frantic Disappointment!
---
I'm at 4 right now. I expect *at least* another three
---
No reason other than rep differences for whichever mounts you want first
---
Yeah same here just spamming the 1 key and tab targeting when needed was the fastest way to tag for me even with the 2 second lag. Showed my latency at 75ms but it sure didnt feel or act like it.
---
And a big fuck you to all the wives/husbands that logged in before my wife and got into the queue ahead of me.
---
Compressed air is like 50 cents and available at literally any store that carries anything even remotely related to office supplies or computers. You’re a muppet.
---
Good announcement. Have an upvote.
---
Yeah there were no queues in Fairbanks lol
---
Could we stop with the "think you do" stuff. If anyone doesn't yet realise this was a bad placed comment and that they have worked quite hard to scrub it off then your're delusional. They obviously know we want it. They released the bloody game ffs.
---
50% of households had broadband in a 2007 so that's way off
---
Fuck being an adult. Why cant I be back in High school like the first time around? Ugh, guess I'll go to bed now since I do have to get up for work tomorrow.
---
eleven thousand player queue right now on Arugal 7 hours after launch.
---
Becoming blizzard should have had all of these servers in advance
---
Thanks much!
---
Oof... I'm hoping when I get off work this morning I can get in fairly quick myself.
---
Why did you reply to me twice? Are you shaking with anger that much you accidentally posted twice? Got get some fresh air, big fella. Blocked.
---
I’ve been able to log in and out freely on Herod. Sorry you had to wait so long !
---
Can anyone explain layering? Is it just putting everyone randomly into a particular sub-server randomly?
---
Arnwe or destructded.  WHAT UP
---
If bigglesworth is EST I’m stressing out!
---
Just form groups..?
---
Nope.  I played vanilla to cata.   I've played other games.  No other games I've played were unplayable for the majority of users at launch.
---
I don't think we should have a sob fest over his loss, but we can have empathy. He lost a ton of revenue over, essentially, a company randomly failing him. It's totally natural to have a bit of a freakout. I know I would.
---
You don't have to like him (I don't), but it's still a genuine, life-affecting misfortune for a real person. I have sympathy, even if I don't particularly care about him.
---
Are the boats running at Menethil Harbor?
---
I got finished with my first session of Classic WoW. I got *exactly* what I wanted.
---
I am. You may be right in the long run but if they can’t get in they can’t play. Whatever. I’ll still be high.
---
I was around 1500th in queue, took my dog on a walk, came back to find that it had loaded and then timed me out. now I'm back to 9362 in queue..
---
Gehennas is one of the four high pop servers. Not really what I asked about, but thank you for replying.
---
\&gt; Day Before Launch: You're amazing blizz we love you!  
---
\&gt; Day of Launch: FUCK YOU BLIZZ YOU FUCKED UP  
---
\&gt; Day After Launch: You're amazing blizz we love you!
---
Second class citizen is a tad dramatic just because you have to wait a week or so for the queue to die down or more servers to be added.
---
Take your time. I wish I could forget all the lore and hit 60 for the first time again.
---
Correct.
---
Glad I made a NE lol 7 hours playtime got in right at launch and no DCs or hiccups
---
Some People are always going to have to be at the front of the queue, so the fact you are won't change how quickly it moves
---
you need to have an active sub. No free trial for classic.
---
You can tell she isn't because she's a twitter user.
---
From 12k to 300 on Bigglesworth. It has been fun guys. I might finally be joining the World of Warcraft. 
---
Started the queue at 9:30CDT, it's 12:30... so about a 3 hour wait.
---
Why can't we have sympathy for both? A person having a steady income doesn't make their misfortune less valid. He got screwed in the exact same way as everyone else, and he is now *losing* money during his business instead of taking vacation time.
---
My only advice: ignore guides. Immerse yourself and do your thing. Don’t install any addons. Just experience the game as it was meant to be, all by yourself and the friends you make in game.
---
Even with a 5 hour wait and shit like this I don't regret going for one of the rppvp servers . The bigger the community the better
---
For me, it's a matter of 2 things... I've basically only played NEs, so I've done the starting zones so many times and never really did the human/dwarf side. And the rest of my leveling group are all dwarves/gnomes... So if I wanted to level with them, I had to make the trip.
---
Mograine? It seems Blizz isnt sharing faction info
---
&gt;Wasnt the entire appeal of layering, and stated multiple times by devs, to be able to instantly spin up layers to have infinite horizontal scaling, thus removing queues from even existing? 
---
No, the point of layering was to handle the inevitable population drop after **few months** without ending up with empty servers.
---
They will wait to see who moves to the new servers they open up. They literally just opened more. If that doesn't help, which it probably won't a noticable amount, the could offer free server transfers.
---
Honestly, the I think it's smart to at least consider moving. As soon as a new server opens, grab names just in case. If the queues don't get better, at least you can go somewhere. People worry about low pop servers in the future. If the queue breaks your will to play, there won't be a future. It's a tough choice, but I'm not sitting in hours long queues every day.

And like everyone else they're posting WAT SHUD I PLAI GUSY on reddit every day for the last 3 months
---
I know, but just parodying meme patterns.
---
Not on faerlina we were dog eat dog at launch...I got taken out by the Eastern Kingdom crash at 11 pm est and i’m still 9000 in que. I found a 8 slot bag before I got dcd tho so worth?
---
It's mysterious. My guess is, that the servers were restarted and that wiped the pouplation count. Accounts only count as population, once they log in to the server again.
---
I thought there was a 5 min DC window
---
Yeah. I think there was an overestimation of just how popular it was going to be. I will be honest. I was skeptic. A part of me still is. I still feel like a handful of people have heavy set of nostalgia glasses on but I think the majority understand what they are getting into after all the information I dived into to get ready. So I am fine with eating my words from the past.
---
I’m not sadly I don’t keep up with streamers. But thanks!
---
Remind me, were there rules against using a non-English language on an English server in the general and trade chat?
---
7 hours later, I'm still in queue with an estimated 360 minute wait...
---
sucks to miss out on launch day with everyone, but when the initial hype dies down single server will probably be better
---
I mean... What's unclear about that lol
---
11 pm EDT happens when this comment is 21 hours and 28 minutes old.

I have the OG Collector's Edition. I prefer to take the panda though. The sleep and swim animations are too cute.
---
This is advertising
---
I like your attitude, I wish I could agree.
---
Just remake characters on the newer realms
---
Certain parts of Eastern Kingdoms got dumped on multiple servers.
---
I got dropped from Brill on Stalagg. Asmongold got dumped from Elwynn on Faerlina.
---
Almost 20k queue and I was waiting at the character screen three hours early.
---
My leveling buddy in Kalimdor I was about to join never got a hiccup.
---
MotherFUCK this launch.
---
Dude same spec here but never played classic before only bfa on my way to play it now
---
Idk why people keep using this quote like they've been proven right.  The game just came out and most people still haven't played it yet. They still think they want to play classic give it a month or 2 and we'll see how many "dont"
---
Hey I want elvui I think for classic, does it use the same client as non-classic elvui?
---
And did they obey the line? How about the respawn time of that mob?
---
Lol, bless your heart.  Even if player base was cut in half 80% of the servers would still have multiple hour queues during prime time.
---
why did my friends have to pick the server with the most nolifes in it, nobody logging off at night, been in queue for 7 hours
---
Vanilla WoW is fairly straightforward and well paced when you take your time and do whatever you want. I can only recommend a quest helper addon, doing every dungeon at least once with every quest associated with it at the appropriate level, and asking players in-game for advice.
---
The servers are however fairly unstable right now and you may run into queues. If you value your leveling experience you may choose to start a few days after launch.
---
Rettungsgasse fehlt
---
Yeah it was the same shit on big fresh pservers
---
Anyone not subbed yet should wait a bit more
---
I can feel it!!!!!
---
Sure, he'd be nice to befriend if his name wasn't a derogatory term for homosexuals and also wasn't telling people to mass report anyone who broke his made up rules.
---
Yeah this is the biggest thing for me too. Ignore guides, ignore elitists on the internet, just roll a class that looks relatable and cool to you and take it slow and be social
---
Yep. Just logged out. It's 130am and all I can think about is getting to level 20 so I can get that sweet sweet cat form.
---
U don't
---
Back in the day they used to have free transfers from full servers to lowpop servers at least
---
Hah. How funny would it be if they had the trial accounts functional ? Like play 7 days until level 20 or how it was back then.
---
Been in queue since 6:45 pm, it is now 1:30 am, with 5k left. Azeroth I'm coming for you! Eventually....
---
Ive been trying to return to wow for years. Everytime im quickly disappointed. Not this time. The gameplay is so much more rewarding. 
---
And the fact that there is No groupfinder forces ppl to be more social. Im having a blast.
---
me too
---
They said their would be in the AMA
---
No they’re throttling players to provide a level gap so zones aren’t flooded. I’ve been playing since servers came up.
---
I waited almost six hours to create a character. Hopefully the maintenance later addresses this shit.
---
Aah nice didn't think about that thanks. I'm in Australia where only one PvP realm was open for name reservation :( Hence my guild is there. I'm sure it will die down in a week or so.
---
What I will actually play:
---
Faerlina is Full
---
Position in queue: 24000
---
Estimated time: 904 min
---
Sheehy two fucking hours looking for fucking crab eyes it was not chill
---
I feel it in me bones!!! ☠️
---
No they didn’t lol. A president of a company is not CEO
---
I think I saw someone say it’s 10 silver.
---
Welcome to 2004. This was daily life.
---
I started at that same number and I'm currently at 7.5k zzzz
---
People just overloading streamers servers as as well,  im in for the long haul so as long as these core servers stick around and healthy im gravy. We all should just soak it in and breath after one day lol
---
No thanks.
---
Druid likely
---
Sweet as, did they give a timeframe on them? People have been saying "Not this year"
---
Trying to get into shazzrah server cause my friends are playing there. Will this probably always be a high que server? Anyone have a prediction?
---
Damn.  Fire up pornhub or call one of your neighbors for their wifi password (the only two options)

NoooooooooooOOOooo
---
its on purpose !
---
Eastern Kingdom crash hit me on faerlina - was about to ding 12
---
Got in right away at midnight on german server Razorfen. But this morning trying to log in for a few minutes before going to work, I just got to the char screen. Loaded for a few secs, then back to the char screen and "you cannot enter realm".
---
No queue or anything, just that. Anyone else having these problems?
---
elitists, meta, and the "best" way to do something in a game just sucks the fun right out imo.
---
[As nature intended. ](https://imgur.com/a/YfFB7ha)
---
Just to counter this, I got DC'd, quit the game, restarted it, and ended back up at character select and was able to play.
---
Skeram, about 4 hours ago.
---
They should use modern wow to go whaling since we have real wow back.
---
You wver think of the fact that the time you spend out having fun, she has to hold down the ford? Go have fun but never take for granted that she Will just take care of everything, and make sure that she has fun alone time too.
---
... then it becomes a cluster fuck of people trying to tag him first.
---
I'm surprised at how much worse Elywnn forest was than the other low level areas. I went from Elwynn, to outside Ironforge, over the mountain and to Darnassus.
---
The dwarf area and night elf area were no lag at all, plenty of people running around. I hearthed back to Elywnn (forgot to change hearthstone), and again it was super lagged. Each area was full of people, I'm not sure what the problem is. But get out of Elwynn ASAP.
---
Because blizzard REALLY fucked up. Releasing four servers in a kneejerk last minute reaction basically means that there was no time for existing communities to properly consider or orchestrate a move.
---
They couldn't have fucked up harder if they tried to.
---
I respect any creator who’s got the guts to end their work while it’s still good, because they’ve explored all the creative space they wanted with it, instead of tortureously milking it because it’s easy, mediocre, mostly creatively bankrupt money (see: The Simpsons)

I feel you fren I'm getting sleepy. Hoping around 1am I'll actually be able to get on...we shall see...good luck to you

Zalazane is far, far worse....

I would be reaching for Xanax and the address of the ISP... And a gun !!

When I arrived in teldrassil as a human, nearly every nelf /waved at me, /gasped, or the like. It was so magical. I was an outcast in an already hyped up group, and was welcomed with open arms and even praise. This game is amazing.
---
They thought we didn't, but we do.
---
Shitty mobile network ISP I guess...
---
Nope he’s not mate. He’s the president yeah, not the CEO.
---
USA. No such luck :/
---
Happened to me in Loch Modan on Faerlina - RIP
---
I just got an added 500mbit/s free of charge in the United States as well. I am not complaining.
---
That's amazing.  5 at a time!
---
Love this post man this got me so much more excited god damn
---
Just did the run at level 3 and i thought to myself that it's going to be a torture but i actually enjoyed it. Met a few people at the Dock in Menethil and talked a bit.
---
It looks like 4 or so new servers went up tonight. They weren't on the list after I ate dinner and came back, but when I quit tonight they were there. Low pop too, at least so far.
---
Think so, same with bootybay
---
double digits club /highfive
---
What an idiotic and downgrading reply....
---
And it was the best 40 minutes of my god damn life.
---
White mane?
---
I agree Twitter is cancer but they can still be a good person. Unfortunately Twitter has a monopoly on that type of social media until something like gab gets popular enough.
---
Thanks a lot for the response man, really. I have a day off tmrw and just wanna play some wow when the store opens up lol. Idk why this is such a hard choice for me, its 2.1 vs 2.6 processor vs slightly better graphics card, can't make up my mind.
---
Oh I made it, it was a SHITSHOW insannnneeeee lag
---
It's honestly miracle how Blizzard did that and survived. It's pretty much cliché in marketing that customer is always right. And Blizzard straight out said we are wrong and they know better what we want.
---
This is the most underrated comment here.
---
You playing since servers came up doesn't change the fact that there's a maximum number of people who can be online at one time, did they say somewhere that they are doing that? Sounds like you were just ahead of the line
---
I guess this is why I managed to log in and get a couple levels while having breakfast.
---
still more fun then BFA
---
Luckily the lady at the call center said that she’s going to inform the people doing the maintenance “that Troublemite wants his internet back right away.”
---
🙄
---
It's called a grace period. The problem is some people are dcing and logging back ASAP only be sent back to the end of the queue.
---
The queue for Thazz'ril's pick on Gandling EU - a proper British queue\*
---
^(Queue) ^(may) ^(contain) ^(traces) ^(of) ^(scandinavian) ^(and) ^(other) ^(nationalities.)
---
Lame
---
I'm very proud of you and I love your commitment
---
que for 7 hours,
---
had a great nap and am well rested..boars better watch out!
---
Dude seeing everyone pop in was awesome. I just stood there for a moment as probably a hundred people faded in, all ready to begin their journey.
---
Awesome, good hunting!
---
Don‘t you have phones ™  to provide your PC with internet access over LTE?
---
Avoid Shazzrah if you want to avoid streamers. I know for a fact Bellular and Preach rolled on horde there.
---
Not on certain servers. gotta wait till realm restarts tomorrow morning
---
Yes! Pat it for me too! But real good
---
Also on the benchmark website the intel products have many times more reports (120k vs 5k) idk if that greatly effects the results.
---
No, my friend who had just got out of the queue and had played for less than a minute got disconnected, while me who had been playing since 'Enter World' turned red was fine
---
Played from the beginning on razorfen. I had no queue. My mate logged in half a minute later and had to wait a little bit.
---
Seems like the next layer just spin up.
---
what are your addons?
---
Meanwhile a free for all in NA servers lol.
---
How long will it be this way to though. That's the question.
---
I was listening when it happened. Their night had been going well and then all their plans were wrecked in an instant. WtF do we do now.... lol
---
I'm sure Blizzard has a lot more info than we do, so I can't say how many people are actually in queue vs how many are playing or how many people are going to drop off or even if the player base will rise. 
---
What I do know is that just every every launch of every major MMO has been like this since the dawn of time.
---
15 hour wait fuck outta here
---
She sounds like a super Chad
---
What should I do about this error that says that active game time is required in order to play classic wow? Do I need to play another WoW game first? I heard this 20 year old game was coming back and I decided to take some weed and try it out and now it's getting harder and harder to solve the problem.
---
Not even 8 hours in to launch, and doomsday is upon us. GJ OP!
---
Super wholesome and makes perfect sense if you know the episode.
---
This guy desever medal, that was not easy task to ask. Other wise this question would be asked earlier, this is what I think. Never forget hoodie heroe and nostalrius.
---
Could you use your mobile data?
---
Are the neckbeards twins?
---
Gotta buy a month subscription from the shop
---
Where can I check what timezones servers are in? I would like to check which server is west coast based
---
I've been in the que for 6+ hours on whitemane. Only 7700th in line now. Both the initial estimate and number were higher than yours. So expect 10 hours instead of 15 for the wait.
---
Why do you want to avoid streamers?
---
Im playing on whitemane and took me 8hrs to finally get in but now im hella tired, I dont even wanna play anymore, but if I go to bed, I might have to wait 8hrs again, If I just hold W with like a weight will I be kicked?
---
Yep, Whitemane. I ended up playing on one of the brand new servers that got released an hour or so ago. Hopefully I can get on Whitemane tomorrow
---
As someone who hates streamers (most of them anyway), I'll level with you since I'm bored in a 12 hour login Q anyway -
---
1. Generally speaking, they are bad people.  Their character development was extremely stunted because they started being paid inordinate amounts of money at a very young age for doing essentially nothing, talking into a web cam and interacting with an imaginary chatbox full of young children and retarded memes.  That's not good for a person, and it shows through pretty clearly on them.
---
2. Related to #1, but the ego on some of these guys.  Jesus christ.  Capitalism has told them that they're winners, and plenty of people would agree.  But some of them have really internalized that, the money and fame.  And what the fuck do they actually do, again?  Nothing.  These people are not talented.  At BEST, some of them were "pretty good" at some video game sometime in the past.  Maybe.  And that's it.  They've just won the internet lottery and become living memes, with 95% of their "content" coming from twitch chat itself, which is self-perpetuating.  Seriously, can you tell me a single thing that Asmongold is good at?  He's like... mildly amusing...?  That's good for millions and millions of dollars?  k.
---
3. Straight up envy.  There's no denying it.  These dudes probably lead some of the easiest lives in the history of the human race.  They get paid salaries that 99.8% of us will only ever dream of, for sleeping in until 2pm and playing video games all night.  Shit we all did when we were 14.
---
Can I play with my friends if they are on different servers than me?
---
Not everything is a conspiracy theory.  I can't speak for every server, but the big DC on incendius was the Eastern kingdoms going down.  Almost guarantee it was caused by all of the lemmings running from darnassus to ironforge, because the guide told them to.
---
Darnassus/darkshore has been some pretty laid back leveling.  Most of the people ran off to the boat the moment they could.
---
Buy a monthly subscription to WoW, it gives you access to Classic.
---
&gt;They didn't?
---
Such a dumb comment totally expected from a Coug. Kek

---
Rattlegore gang
---
We are :D
---
Now those are the type of sweaty nerds I like to see prepared go LAN some wow classic. Gonna smell pretty ripe in there. This is what vanilla was all about
---
People DID swap servers. Stalagg was the first one that Blizz really announced and it's the 4th longest queue in NA.
---
Do you expect people to constantly swarm the server opened a few hours ago?
---
You need to have an active WoW subscription, no purchase of any expansions necessary
---
Yep, doin it
---
Is this your first launch? Give it some days or a week and everything should run smoothly. Of course people are super hyped to play the first day, but a lot of people got life outside WoW to care about.
---
Can you play retail while waiting in queue for classic?
---
Here, I thought id be up all night... 8976 in queue 389minutes BEFORE I RESET IT. lol the true classic experience
---
What's the name of the song? :)
---
No
---
Well, maybe in 15 years
---
The actual queue time is much longer than what the estimation by Blizzard is.
---
It was seriously so amazing. I had to stand there in awe as more and more showed up. Really felt alive. Great feeling.
---
I saw one on Bloodsail for a bit, but when I came back to it later I got right in. It was about 1500 or so people, not much compared to other servers.
---
Hunter macro for pet attack?
---
Darn
---
I was the first human, and 2 gnomes followed along. Everyone was confused, /wave-ing, and /gasp-ing. It was truly magic.
---
Logged in right at 5pm. First area was bonkers and everyone was lagging around but it settled down once I got past level 5. Reached level 11 on my Hunter. Got a pet and worked on some fishing/cooking skills. Died a few times. Met some cool people. All in all, I absolutely love it. It's just as I remembered.
---
There were like 80k people watching Asmongold sleep.
---
"What did I brush my teeth for??"
---
I bought the 3 month subscription since it wouldn't show the scroll-down option on the battlenet app unless I actually got a subscription. Or are you talking about something else?
---
ETA sucks... I got 10 minutes ETA with 55 minutes real wait time. Don't worry, you'll be in by Friday or so :)
---
Prevent the PC from going to sleep due to inacivity
---
Coffee ready, got redbull for backup, all in out sweats n ready to rumble.
---
No.  There are enough people who will move there or starts and they will be fine.
---
On the flip side, the mass disconnected bumped me from 7k in line to being able to play.
---
They just did a server restart
---
Lol:))))
---
I think some more new ones opened tonight. Check for names.
---
Wow what trash glad ibwont be playing for a couple days now I almost felt bad
---
This was me today, good to know I’m not alone.
---
Better luck tomorrow guys!
---
do you compare weiners?
---
I use a pillow but yes i sit on the ground, so I can have computer and doggo at the same time.
---
A charter is 10 silver. A tabbard design is 10 gold.
---
if your not anchored to a guild on a full/high pop server go for it
---
Does your realm have a que still? If so, awesome. I just had several guildies that left to grab something to eat, were only gone for a short time, then got stuck in que.
---
Wednesday thursday
---
The weekend gonna be even worse
---
You on rattlegore?
---
Same happened on Mirage Raceway last night
---
In that case both final fantasy mmos had many miracles.
---
In raids you only want like 1 or 2 deep frost mages for fast Winter's Chill applications, and then you want the rest of your mages to be specced arcane with POM and Arcane Power (In MC/Ony/BWL that is).
---
It does have a queue
---
This but unironically
---
This already existed back then. Also, Blizzards UI is pretty much dogshit for everything going beyond leveling. Addons were always an integral part of WoW, and having the busted API was a reason for me to come back. But alas, it seems Blizzard has other plans for that.
---
Pyrewood Village.
---
Will there be no problems in 10 hours?
---
WoW uses a modest amount data, you’d be surprised. Almost everything is client side.
---
I did the same hahahaha
---
Undead rattlegore squad

4-5 hours of wait

No, but admitting that you're wrong and fixing your mistakes probably is.
---
So change server... You’re just level 10
---
I had my 8 hours of continuous fun time for sleep now.
---
This guy ques
---
Not like we totally knew this from beginning and blizzard thought a hand full of servers is enough for millions of people.
---
Yeah I got some family to try to log me in to get into queue early and they couldn’t. I check my email and my social club account has been changed and then my battle.net account was too. I think my email got hacked because that was stolen too but there were a lot of emails to change my battle.net account password.
---
An Oblivion meme. I see you are a wo/man of class
---
I prefer BFA tbh (And yes I welcome the downvotes, sorry I can enjoy both games!)
---
Retail is that away.  Layering is only acceptable because they committed to removing it after launch, phase 2 at latest.
---
Sharding is a cancer, one of many that turned classic into retail.  Flying, sharding, QOL changes, LFG, LFR, ECT ECT.
---
No. No, don't apologize. Youbare the hero that we exactly need
---
What server was that ? (so I make sure I don't go there by accident)
---
up to 25k as i heard, they are still there, like up to 10k
---
Classic is about the experience not efficiency
---
Wife and I are staying at my folks until our house closes this weekend. My rig is in storage, and the only computer here is a 2010 Mac that won't run WoW.
---
What's another few days?
---
.....
---
lolno
---
I mean u could just put yourself in queue while you are "waiting to avoid queues" and then just poke your head into the client at some point and go "oh look I can play now". You just traded waiting for waiting, except one could actually provide a result. Why not just click on it and see where you are at when it's done?
---
"I'll launch a new MMO.  Hrm.  MMOs usually have an issue where they have more initial players than stable playerbases.  What can I do to *really exacerbate that issue*?  Oh, I know, I'll grant FREE ACCESS to this new MMO if anyone has an active subscription to WORLD OF WARCRAFT!  That will guarantee huge numbers of initial players, who are already playing a different MMO, many of whom will stick with it!  
---
The fact that Classic WoW is free2play for players of another adjacent MMO is the least vanilla-like thing going.
---
Just wanted to say you have phenomenal taste in games. Those are three titles that every gamer should definitely give a shot if they have the opportunity.
---
I was half expecting you to get DC lol
---
The launch of any new MMO or Xpac is always like this for 2 weeks. No point in buying servers to be used for two weeks during the hype train then have them idle afterwards.
---
Wildstar literally died because they did this.....twice.
---
I dont even play wow or am playing this classic launch and when I saw the like 10 or 15 servers that were on the list when people were reserving names I laughed. Even when everquest went live in 1999 they had like 50 servers.
---
Yeah I got some family to try to log me in to get into queue early and they couldn’t. I check my email and my social club account has been changed and then my battle.net account was too. I think my email got hacked because that was stolen too but there were a lot of emails to change my battle.net account password
---
Interesting. Then I think the task is to figure out what the grace period is then.
---
Also, for some reason I thought it was 11pm tonight I could play as I'm in England. Turns out I was wrong!

---
Many fans of the streamers will play on their server, plus many people looking to troll said streamer. This will creste log in queues or potentially crash the server. Athene woild regularly crash the server he played on when doing community events and having everyone grouped in the one place.
---
Shazzrah.
---
I was going to roll Fairbanks but rattlegore is pretty cool and I will probably stay on it.
---
We tried forming a line, until one asshat named Toxj decided to skip the queue and then keep kill stealing for the next few spawns out of spite.
---
a 2010 mac can't run a game from 2004... you sure about that?
---
Did the leave raid after killing bosses to get quest items get fixed? I remember doing that in 10-15 man scholo.
---
Couldn't make a bio for it. But make a new macro, don't pic an icon, do "/cast attack" and the image changes to a picture of some guy cheesing :) thought this was pretty funny
---
Duality and balance in everything :) im still figuring out hoe to add flair lol
---
And also getting kicked from the character screen due to inactivity if I get in and am still sleeping
---
Incendius sound off yo. 
---
My guild wanted to avoid the insanity of the big servers, so we picked the new server this am.  The queue was bad at first, but let up around 11:30 pm est.  dwarf starting  zone was populated but not overwhelming.  Like many others I got to 10 before logging for the night. Tomorrow I’ll head to stormwind and darkshore.  Hopefully the population stays strong.
---
Wow, already a sixth of the way through the game.  In a day or two you'll already be done.
---
I'm 4500 in queue on whitemane... cant wait to kill some of them vermin.
---
OP is just crying and being defensive against legit responses
---
I've been waiting 6 hours, still expecting a few hours ahead of me since I'm only down to 3k ahead of me
---
Is your bus ride 16 hours?
---
People reported 30 in character select
---
While this looks like a really considerate and respectful environment and thus a funny experience, I'm kinda glad I can't play until sunday.
---
Hopefully until then most people have vacated the starting zones.
---
No, he's joking, you're the only clown here
---
&gt; Lol except d3, but that was the game not the servers)

Diablo 3 had a terrible launch due to server issues as well. I remember the vast majority of players not being able to play/login due to "Error 37".
---
Already sent blizz support an email asking them to refund my game time and I traded the 2 gold I had saved up to a random guy who walked passed me in stormwind. Can't go back now
---
I owe a favor for two days of skipping dirty diapers and cooking duties, alongside other small household chores. No need to make it so serious. :)
---
Waiting in that queue. I have the name Ice for my mage. I can’t turn back now.
---
Haha, I wish...
---
Mouse movement wont save you from that
---
It's going to be that way until people move off the server.  So you're banking on either people giving up and moving to a new server, or quitting entirely.
---
Queues would be less crazy if people would move to the new servers instead of sitting k. The queue for seven hours.

Read this and ur dps will not be nonexistent in Naxx.
---
Hahahaa i gave up last night already, line in Q esfimated time 8 hours. This morning still 110 minutes. ;)
---
So i preslept ofc (europe start at midnight) so i got a nice long sleep this night ... hahaha
---
I was right, got in my server which was medium pop with 0 queues and no issues
---
OCE players didn't have the option of dispersing initially and very few will switch servers now that their friends are already on one. 6hrs down probably 3 to go
---
Meh, that took me roughly 5-6 hours of playtime.... (slow and steady) I definitely don’t want to do that over again. I might consider going a different class.... but quite frankly, those 6 hours as a mage was probably the best gaming experience I’ve had a quite some time. (I was an original vanilla player).
---
Looking forward to tomorrow!
---
What kinds of things are covered in the guide?
---
This.
---
Printscreen and paste into Paint is the true vanilla experience.
---
I have seen these queues for a quest mob before. But I can't remember if it was during vanilla or later. Vanilla and TBC kind of blur together for me.
---
It's usually to play with their friends or do deadmines.
---
Yep
---
If you have already got 2g then youre lying about it all.
---
I just paid classic for 8 hours straight lol. It's amazing
---
Newb here, is there actually a reason to do this or just memes?
---
Q: Will you offer free realm transfers if servers get way overpopulated after launch?
---
A: “This is definitely one of the options we are considering. But for now, we are encouraging players to use the name reservation period to transfer their characters to lower population realms.”

Hey for real. I get off work in an hour. What do the queue times look like right now? Think I could get in within like 2 hours? or is that a completely bonkers thought?
---
It’s all good, i’m at 422 now. Just ready to play the damn game.
---
Yeah. See you tomorrow in stormwind.

It's less about how old the game is relative to the laptop and more about how old the laptop is.

oh nice! GZ on that :)
---
i also plan to fish a little bit when i get into the game
---
Once people realize they have to switch realms. If nobody switches realms then the high populated realms will continue to stay at 10k+ queues
---
No, I'm deliberately unemployed
---
It is the only way !
---
I join the queue at 11 P.M. yesterday to play at midnight, I waited 2 hour, after I pick up the first quest and find a mob I got a DC and another 1 and half hour queue, and the game said server error. I think I got the true vanilla experience.
---
I think warlock would be less boring, im thinking about playing warlock and rogue.

How can these addons work if Blizzard has removed access to that part of the API?

Oh shit it's Shawn White!

/f add Toxj to the shitlist
---
Not an issue if it doesn't teleport you... It's just a group finding tool, so you don't have to sit in a city spamming for a groups.  Don't like it, don't use.  Smart people will use it to farm while waiting for their groups.  Enjoy being poor.

there's no q uest on the barrel, that's the problem, the addon shows there is, but without the addon t here's nothing, and I never did the quest, I'm thinking maybe it's a only gnome quest

those blank faces at the end got me

4pm in EU.

Yes, go slow and have fun.  Screw guides and being effektive. The best memmories are being made while you still are absolutely clueless.

In classic i ran in a dress as a warrior at lvl 55, just for the looks. And man i used bows for a long time haha

It's not even a big deal. It's just a better way to make groups stop complaining over nothing

My favorite part of playing so far was waiting in line. Joking around and roleplaying in line with others was fun... Until a group of griefers camped the spawn :(.

PVP servers are not this civilised

Do you have the right Region? NA/EU/OC?
---
I logged in at 5.30am this morning on shazzrah and managed to get in without a que somehow 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Upvired gonna do it later
---
Golemagg had a 10k queue
---
You need to buy a beer from the bar keep up stairs.  Give it to the dwarf guarding the barrel in the basement, he'll walk away, then you can click the barrel.
---
It's layering though, the successor of sharding. Let them spin up some more layers, eventually it will be fine.
---
Lol superpower as having extra hand or fingers XD
---
Fuck Karen
---
See Activision... you can make money selling games instead of loot boxes.
---
That logic actually doesn't make sense. Playing for 8 hours straight isn't addiction. Playing 8 hours straight for weeks is addiction. Have you ever gamed for 8+ hours in one sitting EVER? You're retarded.
---
Just the commenter was on skeram not asmon.
---
Is there some information, thread or post somewhere about queue lenghts/times beside the one on wowhead?
---
He's annoying as shit.
---
That's it really. Also he's a neckbeard and a bad face for wow.
---
Hey. I am an officer in an OCE guild which somehow took live to win as it's theme song some time in February/March . Just wondering how it became popular , and where you got on the meme train, because it's an astoundingly shit song yet gets everyone going in the best way. Curious for your response.
---
And now people are going to yell at you for a phone screenshot :(
---
It is not like you are making and selling stuff to manajunkies? Right? Mages are just dealers :p
---
Im at around 2000-3000 now, left the house for a bit.
---
Yeah.. I played 8 hrs. Straight today and made it to 10. It was the first time I’ve done it in probably... 8? Years.
---
Well they should have put some cap on chars created past reservation. I reserved my names in Skeram and Blemaux considering Skeram was going to explode and Blemaux was medium by the time. I logged in at release exact time and Blemaux was starting to show as high but had very low queue like 100 and was under 1 minute to enter. Now the server is on a 4k+ queue with a 2hrs timer...
---
Two main issue is a lot dumb players that are starting right now and dodging the low/medium pop servers straight into a queue. I understand if you have guild or friends there, but if you dont then dont try to start on a server that already has a long queue. Second one is Blizz not putting a cap on char creation past reservation...
---
Or do what I did and let your little sister climb mountains in dun morogh while you eat
---
That sounds very frustrating. 
---
I came home after work around 5pm. Went into queue and been here ever since. It is almost midnight now..
---
diacritical marks aren’t that bad...
---
Once you grab the Ironforge, Thelsamar, and Menethil Harbor flightpoints. Traveling between Stormwind, Ironforge, and Darnassus is much easier.
---
The first time you do it, it will probably take 30-45 min depending on your lvl and your ability to avoid mobs .
---
From Stormwind, head to the Dwarven District, then take the Deeprun Tram to Ironforge. Before leaving Ironforge, make sure to grab the flightpoint. Then travel East to Loch Modan. Right before you get to Loch Modan, you will hit a fork in the road. Going north is technically faster, as the pass drops you in northern Loch Modan. HOWEVER, the Loch Modan flight point is on the southern end in Thelsamar. I recommend taking the southern pass in the fork, then grabbing the flight path in Thelsamar. From there, continue north on the road. 
---
The trickiest part is the transition between northern Loch Modan and southern Wetlands. The pass contains Orcs that will likely kill you. You can choose to jump off of the cliff into Wetlands,  but your ghost will likely have to run back from the Thelsamar graveyard (as it happened to me today). Res at your body and stick close to the mountains as you run to Menithil Harbor. 
---
Once in Menithil, grab the flight path and take the boat to Darkshore. That boat will be on the northern section of the dock. The southern dock is reserved for the boat to Theramore. Once in Darkshore, cross to the other side of the dock to take the boat to Darnassus.
---
- - - Getting back and forth between Darnassus, IF, and SW- - -
---
Much quicker the second time. Flight path from Darnassus to Darkshore &gt; Boat to Menethil Harbor (Southern end of sock) &gt; Flightpath from Menethil Harbor to Ironforge &gt; Deeprun Tram from Ironforge to Stormwind
---
Noob question. What's DCed mean?
---
Apparently medium not low
---
I am envious of you guys.. i only get to log on around 5 AM Paris-time. Do you think there will be long queues at that point?
---
Well transfers wouldn't fix that problem either. You'd still have to change your name.
---
3k queue on Atiesh took only about 40 minutes - zero lag in Dwarf starter zone and not super crowded either which was nice. Good to be back.
---
In another timeline that happened and Classic released years sooner.
---
7.3k in OCE :(
---
You can set up RDP or even teamviewer to remote into your computer from your phone.
---
My guess is that close to 1million people tried to play. I found it unbearable, so I'm going to wait u til later today. But still I enjoyed the experience!
---
rip NDA
---
All I’m saying is that I’ve been on this subreddit I believe way around Legion aswell to play classic. Legion sucked aswell so
---
8 slot red leather bag dropped for me. that's like first date anal
---
Nah, Grob’s a shitshow too
---
If you have TeamViewer or Chrome Remote Desktop, consider using it on your way home so you don't have to be in hour long queues once you actually get home.
---
That's what I'm doing at least, also have work today, for another 7h.
---
It was on the method stream about a hour ago - one of the players had his whole bar with that macro
---
"Spanish isnt a race". If thats what you get from my words, then you confirm that you are both racist and a huge ignorant. 
---
Have a nice day. :)
---
Atiesh has no queue now
---
It's as legit as for other classes. You could do that
---
Make it so that it kicks you from the party when you enter a dungeon and then tells you to
---
My one 4 slot from the quest in razor Hill is not good enough!
---
Servers are up, world server is still down this guy is right tho. Get into the game to avoid long ques.
---
Can we pump the brakes on success just yet. I am honestly a little shocked about NA’s server explosion myself. I expected half the servers to be full and the others to be high to medium but not like this. 
---
With that said: Wildstar also has this kind of explosion and it died within a couple of months. We should probably wait to see what happens. I assume we will see the people who never played Vanilla, but wanted to try it. These people will leave first. Then the ones who are playing for nostalgia reasons, but forgot all bad that came with the good. They are next, because those glasses wear off eventually. We will be left with those who want the nostalgia but know what they are getting into. Streamers and the bandwagoners that stay. I am going to assume most of the people in this sub will as well.
---
Yeah the 50 people queue for 1 quest item will get annoying soon
---
going to switch back to your main server once things slow down?
---
For the big servers there were thousands more in queue than in game.
---
Can anyone tell me what the queue for Whitemane is at right now? I'm already in the middle of a queue for another server and considering switching over.

You want those pics? I got to level 11 before logging off
---
gz, waited 2 hours before launch, got in played for 90 mins and then got disconected and had a 20k queue with a 50 min timer which never went down.then it was decided it was bed time. amazin
---
Amazingly, that's how it works.
---
Would it blow your mind if I told you players were currently playing on Herod? No shit people *can* get on lmao.
---
No it should not. Servers show as higher pop during peak times.
---
Yes.
---
This waiting on a queue to wait on a queue is hilarious and honestly the best time I had tonight.
---
I logged on at like 21:00, dc-d once, got back to a small queue, I was in at the start, played half an hour then went to sleep.
---
Tried again this morning at around 7:00, 800 people queue, played another half hour.
---
It's been flawless for me, wish I had the time to actually play.
---
Sounds like you want the right region, and maybe french servers? If you have that selected, try finding an option where you can tick a box for pvp
---
16000, bad
---
Eh, I think directing the people watching your stream to /spit on anyone who has a store mount (the most recent of which were automatically distributed to people who already had 6 month subs) is pretty shitty. For someone who laments the lack of interpersonal relationships in the current iteration of wow, it's also pretty hypocritical.
---
Disconnected.
---
Posts like this seriously baffle me.
---
I know not what faisy chains others may fall  to, but as for Herod, we will forge our warriors in conflict and anger.
---
People will definitely begin to trickle over here. Sulfuras is a badass name.
---
I had no queue.
---
Never forget
---
I was another one of the lucky... well... thousands! on my server. It was magical!
---
wow
---
I'm on zandalar tribe. Hopefully it's not a dead server
---
See you later
---
Yea it feels infinitely better than on retail.
---
I can't even remember the last time I set goals on retail
---
Oh god, and when was the last time you've partied up with someone just for a non-world quest?
---
I didn't play vanilla when it was new, but it's actually so much better. It doesn't even feel grindy, really. I don't have this "lets hurry up and do this so I can get to the real content" feeling like I have with retail. It doesn't feel like a grind, it just feels like i'm developing my character. 
---
The only thing I miss is the battlepets. I fukn loved my pokemon knockoff.
---
i've bought, can't give the beer because there's no dialog or anything to click, I think this shit is bugged for me
---
They aren't griefers, they are playing the game
---
Make an addon?! :D Looks great
---
Could of's deserve permaban imo, and a 2k $ fine
---
We try to be. :)
---
Come home from a long day at work, position in que = 11,000.
---
Authentic af.
---
The queue seems to be bugged out for me. I'm stuck at position 42 lol - guess that's the meaning of life?
---
They might have changed the thresholds for each density tier.

I think people just wanted the old world back, we missed it ever since Cata
---
I joined queue as the servers went "live" world wide and i'm **STILL** in the queue, its been over 8 hours....
---
Either +petattack or /petattack

He has done nothing wrong. People here hate streamers. He is the most successful of them all, so he is the most hated one. Don't bother in finding any logic, is just how we humans are.
---
They had two weeks to prepare for this lol
---
Yeah focus on WoW you have more time now.
---
Yes :)
---
I think thag may be a lot more then people like to  believe. Vanilla/Classic with all it's flaws is just a ton more engaging and fun to play as an MMO, and i think Blizz and the naysayers will find out of that pretty soon. 
---
There is a reason orivate servers were a big thing, and why Blizz is investing in Classic.
---
Nice chg90
---
Brady game guide or wow atlas $20 on amazon
---
I thought this launch wasn't that bad. It was stable but with huge queues and they been addressing them adding new servers. Of which they haven't even all filled yet because people are refusing to move. It's a lot better to have queues than the alternatives.
---
&gt;5k queue
---
&gt;reasonable
---
Yep, this is classic.
---
God bless Classic WoW community. -Love from the Horde.
---
Had it once where I lived before, but that was a shitty Internet company and I lived in the city centre. Not once since I moved and got fiber
---
The problem is that as they were originally conceived the add-on was going to use a hidden channel to communicate only to other mod users about groups seemingly first and fill from there before using the lfg channel. It was going to mean that at a certain critical mass it would eventually become REQUIRED to use the mod or finding groups would eventually become impossible. Thankfully the mod author decided to change it when blizzard said they were going to break the API that allowed that.
---
The fact the mod author thought this fits in classic though also makes me want to tell him to feck off. Don't want to know what his next great idea for classic is.
---
Ofcourse, just like any other game you can drop in for a while and enjoy the ride with some slow progression. With limited time, release might prove a difficult time to play, but when things settle down, no problem :)
---
No wonder it's easy to like you.
---
yeah me and my friend both got kicked and insta put in queue, Maybe giving others a chance?
---
I’m on Kirtonos Ally and legit 30 people sat on that human starter zone boss. 90 second spawn timer. I was there for 40 minutes before I gave up.
---
Yeah mate me and another party member,  9k que now.  Ffs
---
Nah ur good my name is cockinassman and I'm fine
---
Same to me and a mate.
---
How long is the que for gehennnas atm? At work so i cant check
---
I’m a dwarf and made the run to the night elf area to play with my OH, totally worth it the equipment is nicer, the area is nicer and it didn’t take long, for a while I was the only nine night elf there 😂
---
Me and my group are playing on a low pop server. There is still PLENTY of people running around, stealing our herbs and helping with mobs. Even at 4 AM. The first 3 hours were absolutely insane.
---
anyone know if there is a sheet like that for EU? As a working human being, with 4-5 hours of queue, I won't be able to play until the weekend...this sucks :(
---
Just got DC'd to the login screen. Log back in 8k queue on Arugal too. Dem Feels...
---
Thank you!
---
Yup, it was the whole server RIP!
---
You talked to the guy with the blue ?
---
yeah same here
---
skinning, cooking, whatever else. You'll have to go there after killing the humans anyway
---
No, not really. It was a judgement call in yesterday’s management meeting due to concerns raised by some of our techies who are WoW players.
---
Holy priest is a top healer. If you want to play a healer, that's a solid choice. But if you want a different class, but still heal, you will have it just as easy to find a raid spot as a Druid or Shaman/Pally
---
not a source but ion said 3k concurrent users per server in a forbes interview for vanillia, and some other source said classic was 4x larger so 12k sounds spot on to me
---
yep, nice 9000+ que
---
Exactly what I wonder too. Havent bought it yet but how long is que for english speaking PVP servers?
---
What is time?
---
yup
---
thats the thing..
---
I have folder titled "world of Warcraft", a folder titled "WoW\_PTR".
---
There is no other folder?
---
Most of the people in the EU are working now, i guess the first big "test" will be in the evening.
---
Whole lot of people just got dc'd from OC - Arugal =\
---
Imagine DCing a whole server to get people in queue into the game
---
I wouldn't know. Haven't played yet
---
I'd secure names on a different server, if I didn't have to leave queue to do so
---
Same!
---
Same to me.
---
Yep, was questing in the barrens then boom back to queue.
---
Are you guys seriously still waiting in queues? Just go on a low pop server and wait a week before your realm calms down, stop being so stubborn
---
Yea, I went there, felt kinda dead so I'm back on grob xd
---
To be fair, it was still fairly easy to be spoon fed back then. The difference is that most of us have done that run many times, and therefor, the allure of discovery just isn’t the same because we know what to expect. 
---
My first time doing that run was on a lvl 17 NE warrior, who still exists at that lvl with no talents lol. I took a boat with 3 other people who were also clueless. We had no idea where the boat went or where we were ultimately heading. Somehow, after many deaths, we made our way to Ironforge, granted none of us knew what it was, or if it was even friendly at the time. 
---
It was super fun, but there is no way to relive that moment in WoW, now that I know the different zones, the world, the mobs, etc. Can’t relive discovery.
---
I hit level 11 but calling it a night
---
Had a blast though.
---
I do have a hi-res version. It's 6000x4000 instead of 3000x2000. However, it is currently exclusive to my Patrons. My lowest tier is only $1/month and it comes with access to hi-res versions of all my maps now and in the future! I expect to release about once a week so I think it's a pretty good value. Here's the [hi-res version](https://www.patreon.com/posts/deadmines-hi-res-29422144) of this map.
---
im 1.5k away.  been queued since 2:30pm.  its 11:30pm now.  rethinking where to play, but i want to play where i have my names reserved and guild...
---
If they want to skip the queues they'll have to download an RP profile add-on and get writing!
---
First time playing and had a blast. The community at Mograine was really chill, all the zoomers went to Firemaw
---
my dad works at nintendo
---
Can confirm just happened to me and my mate as well...
---
Legit got this, 8000 re-queue I want to scream
---
I thought you censored some names, guess i was wrong.
---
friend and i got randomly booted out after playing since launch, completely different sides of the country so it wasnt an internet issue, and now we're in a queue of 10k. thanks blizz... wheres this 'grace period' everyone was talking about
---
Whats tn tittare?
---
Waited in que since launch for 7 hours. Got in, played for an hour then got disconnected. Position in que now 11,000. Working as intended.
---
I waited for 220 minutes, then spilled a full glass of red wine all over my old keyboard (luckily it was on its way out anyway) and then wiped it off while it was still plugged in. A thousand chromes launched and my computer restarted itself. Just as I got on the server! FML
---
How does low, medium, high servers work? 
---
Is there a playercap like 10k max at low, 20k max at high? Or is it based on how many people are playing on them?
---
Came back from the gym into a 1hr+ que, probobly not playing untill tomorrow. 
---
Gonna go back to learning gamedev to quench the addiction :&gt;
---
See you tonight
---
Check your /programms or /Programms86 folder, god knows why, but my classic got installed there.
---
Germans that lost the war maybe.
---
How long do you guys think it'll be before the queues for Faerlina die down? A week or two?
---
They do **now**.
---
Yup.. think the full servers have a couple of thousands atleast
---
What's wrong with the one on wowhead ?
---
Did this run tonight. Can confirm boats are working, at least on Whitemane.
---
Woops here's one with the newly added servers
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294733/new-pvp-realms-and-rp-pvp-realm-now-open-on-na-servers
---
Yeah...this is why I'm waiting until the weekend to play Classic. I can ignore the annoying first few days of chaos.
---
The pop was low this morning but tonight im gessin a bit more people
---
Same here after a fu king 6.5 hour wait from open of servers t bis morning fuckkkkkkkkkk
---
Oh we expected to be DC'd and have to wait, but going on 8+ hours of accumulative waiting for a game Blizzard has been hyping for 2 years and known full well for months how excited people are for is a bit more than we anticipated.   We've played literally every expansion together starting with TBC, and none have been this bad in terms of wait times.
---
Also, I go on call for work Wednesday for a week so this was really our only shot for a gamer night for the next week and a half, so there's that.
---
Other posts and comments have suggested it's closer to 4 million people who have tried to login.
---
Yeah i think so, we gaming to hard obviously
---
Yeah, but Gehenmas still hs a 4k que at this hour, I assume people go to work at around 9/9:30 or they just quit to become wowghouls.
---
it is viable
---
it is not optimal
---
There's post on sub front page where horde does the same
---
Mate, here in Aus, my Mate logged on at 7:50am and even though the servers went live at 8am, he didn't get on until 4:30pm.
---
Meanwhile, I logged on after work at 12pm. RIP.
---
It had a 15k+ queue
---
So fucking stupid.. they should of started with more then 2 servers bunch of plebs
---
Yeah. For sure.
---
Youre not gonna be fine :&gt; @me when you get flagged
---
It depends on the server I think, EU PVE and RP didn't have any queue, but people were talking in chat about long queues on PVP.
---
Same here. Feels so much better being able to get to level 9 than maybe 2 if I ever even got in on another server
---
I was totally in the same spot back then. The memories :')
---
I was at 26k about 7 hours ago. Down to 6.5k
---
Two days ago I was walking into the airport in Seattle and there were Classic posters up all around. Was pretty awesome to see.
---
I got one before getting dcd, worth it
---
2617 in queue.  I wonder if she gets disconnected like I did right as I get logged in.  hahaha
---
Trust me you were wrong.
---
Lol. We get the run, you get Barrens
---
its not that bad.  level to 2 for another skill and then set your hearth in kharanos, you'll die once for sure and possible 2-5+ times more on the run.  then just hearth back at 6 or 8 to train, and at that point you can survive the whole 2nd run no problems.
---
I'm on Skeram. Seems like only Eastern Kingdoms was booted. Kalimdor stayed up.
---
There will definitely be a decent sized player base but I think people are way overestimating how many players will stick around
---
Da fuq blizz?
---
I appreciate the input; it's all good! I think your talking about polling rate, which I have confirmed is not the issue. Still not sure what's doing it though. It is 100% specific to Classic WoW (maybe BFA as well, but haven't played).
---
EU stonespine had 0 queues lmfao
---
Hopefully they do this. Leveled to 7 today on my priest on Stalagg.. havent been able to get back on since.

sick hail my dawgs
---
I guess low pop is the smart choice then, it will get full eventually
---
There is no lead when their layers crash at random . You can’t have a legit race when it’s pure random if you get to even play.
---
que is moving quick at least. 
---
Gonna take a short cat nap
---
How many realms there are? Is there any realm focused on PvP and Roleplay?
---
Ahmpy is almost 22.
---
Were you guys in Eastern Kingdoms when you dcd? 
---
Asking because this happened quite a bit on the classic beta but for Kalimdor instead. The one commonality I found with the big DC that hit streamers around 11pm (eastern) was that they were all on Eastern Kingdom. Wondering if people should book it for a boat to kalimdor next time they are in.
---
q
---
Alenya was on a similar level, but just got dced too.
---
Guide lime
---
People in queue were watching streamers on queue :D
---
Sounds like you got hit with the same thing I did. Random dc and then stuck in queue...im at 7654 though.
---
I was loving rattlegore tonight. Feels like all the people who don't have time to wait in queue went there for the most part. Was a chill night
---
Keep in mind that it may seem like the matchmaker saves you a lot of time compared to before - but there was still flying mounts and a lot of portals and flight paths and summon tools but the truth is a matchmaking Addon won’t be an obvious upgrade since getting a group took a fraction of the time getting everybody actually TO the instance took.
---
Nope. "Active game time is required to play."
---
And queue for every named quest mob from now on
---
Its cool only the first time
---
8ish hours and I'm still 6k away
---
Lmfao the topic wasn’t about queues
---
Standalone
---
It was at 1.2 million viewers
---
As is tradition
---
they are seperated
---
ARDENNER GROUND IS BURNING
---
Thanks, lads! It's my turn now! Instantly got in!
---
it's not the same without my mom coming in and me quickly alt tabbing to a word file or website to pretend I'm doing homework.
---
my dad was a bit trickier. he'd check the text and ask me why I'm still at the same sentence 2 hours later. w-writer's block I guess...
---
good times.
---
Same here, then got put in the back of the line. Sad.
---
No queues = zones weren’t pack at all
---
Ha thats not how it went down for me there, the whole undead zone was cancer, those are the worst quests for overcrowded servers there are, camp a node and spam tab + attack and good luck.
---
I just invited random people in the starting area to do quests like kill boars easier and some of them stuck around instead of leaving after the quest were complete.
---
Don't!
---
Friend of mine queued on lucifron (ger) on launch and was in position 23k with 500 minutes to wait.
---
In the morning (it's 9 now) it was like 3k queue with 10 minutes to wait.
---
I'd expect it to be 15-20k in the evening when i'm able to play, so i'll probably switch to venoxis.
---
That’s good for speed leveling, but not as fun for the adventure.
---
Yeah everyone in our guild in Darkshore got disconnected and straight at the back of a 7k+ queue
---
Had my 8+ hours, planning on playing most of the night, then i got DC'ed and the Q is 10k long guess I am going to bed after all.
---
instead of `_retail_` it's `_classic_`. For me, at least. I think it's under program files though, not users.
---
RP-PVP is instant. guess I'll play my alt for a while
---
Unless you are going for early rep, in which case this is optimal.
---
Just got hit with one on Fairbanks. Bed time indeed.
---
It's measured in minutes versus hours. It's reasonable and queues are what we all demanded to avoid the other alternatives. It's worth noting that the low pop servers that are new with these queues will alleviate over time. The queues also prevent the login servers etc from getting slammed by the 5k people leaving Herod to make a character. Until this initial rush period of people switching I ends and we see if they end up at high as well they probably don't want to immediately add new servers. Remember the goal is healthy high lol servers in a month or two past launch. 
---
What me and my girlfriend did during the original launch in 2004 was one of us came home early each day and put us both in queues. By the time the other got off work 2-3 hours later we were finally getting in.  If you don't have someone to play with I recommend the multitude of remote viewing desktop apps that will let you log in and control your mouse and keyboard remotely and start your queuing process before you even leave work or school for the day. It's not perfect but I honestly think these lower pop server queues are going to die down as the servers fill up a bit more and most of it is just the anti-crash login protection. Some private servers had similar on launch day to prevent people from hammering it too fast. That's why you see queue even though it's still low pop. 
---
But either way 3-5k queues are not ideal but it's reasonable since it's less than an hour. Especially since it's temporary.
---
4d  chess
---
We've played every expansion the moment it went live.  Worst we've ever had was a couple hour wait aside from total downtimes when nobody was able to get on.  Honestly it wouldn't even be a big deal if we just got to play together and wait together.  It's just strange timing that We both get booted, I get back in immediately, she waits 4 hours, gets back in the very moment I'm booted and I'm now on almost hour 4 myself.  Just bad timing.
---
Yeah what a killjoy
---
I gor 3 before I left deathknell
---
The satyr in the NE starting area was constantly a frog for about an hour.
---
Yeah.. you would not think that this much hype can actually be bad in some way... I just hope that the situation will calm down a bit. I personally wait few days before logging in. As much as I am hyped I am not a huge fan of sharing every mob with another 100 players.
---
It's great that both of you are on the same boat. I am sure you'll manage your schedule to play together at some point.
---
Good luck.
---
There was a reset that lasted for about 15 minutes. Maybe that was it?
---
🤣
---
Razorgore it is. It would be stupid to play in Full server, the leveling and competition for the mobs is too high, waste of time. Blizzard said, they would offer server transfers later in the game, so if any server would die - server transfer.
---
If they could do another 3000 person disconnect that would be great
---
whole server got booted it seems
---
Same! But I had such a potato pc I had to hear them coming and alt tab a good 5-10 seconds before they actually came in or I would’ve never stood a chance.
---
What level are you now?
---
Argul is fucked go Yojambo or w/e its called no ques zones are still packed.
---
I just farmed humans and found someone who had tailoring leveled up to make them. Ez
---
I was in...for 1 min then DC and back to the queue. Good night.
---
Pristine german cringe
---
Whole bunch of us across Kalimdor on Arugal got DC'ed about 10 minutes ago.
---
From what I've heard, classic is expected to be more popular then retail. Not sure how true this will be.
---
Im pretty reasonable. I didnt bitch about the 10 hour queues but the random DC with no grace rejoin is absolute garbage.
---
Oh shit really, sick. Didn't manage to get this week off work so wasn't upp for the launch.
---
Damn man, I really have no hopes to play classic in Whitemane any time soon and I don't want to play in a medium realm. Sucks you can't play retail while queuing for classic
---
Didn't get their shit together? How ignorant.
---
EU is not any better... At 4am here I was getting 8k-16k queue on Firemaw, Golemagg and Shazzrah
---
Yep! just sharing how bummed I am about the situation and figured others here were probably in the same boat..  Thanks!
---
New servers were great. Logged into Rattlegore at around 6pm PST, queue of 500, and was able to play for five and a half hours. Definitely recommend the server. Was super nice.
---
oof that sucks
---
At launch was a mess and people would just keep trying to loot for themselfs
---
Stonepine was the realm they added after launch lmfao. This server will be dead in 3 weeks. Have fun! And you are still wrong as always. Every normal server was insanely packed.
---
Yes i guess but you'll never complete a dungeon or raid without getting kicked. 
---
Hunters have 3 melee abilities, only 1 of which is worth having on your bars.
---
LOLLLLLLL. I just waited 9 hours, ran up the stairs from undead starting area and disconnected. I'm actually tilted off the face of the earth, send help.
---
Of course not. Retail economy has much, much bigger numbers, a single player's gold amount would ruin a whole classic server's economy.
---
It wasn’t whole server, just lots. The guys I’ve been playing with since launch are still on currently. Fucking F’s all around lads.
---
that would be me then :/
---
I finally got in fairbanks after 8 hours in queue, got to level 5 and got dced, now im back in queue
---
This is stupid as fuck
---
He means that no where in the game does it say that if you don't wait in some made up line system that you are greifing. It might be not so nice but it's not greifing.
---
Is this a review of me from my ex
---
Truthfully in 40 mans a lot of people are going to just spam their best and most efficient spell/s. Even healers if they are on the ball pretty much just do their best heal. I’m not going to tell you mages are super fun to raid with (at least while you’re doing all the fire raids) but don’t be surprised if you bid yourself just sitting and spamming no matter which class you pick

---
ClassicCodex is better
---
Ah so Herod? Lol I had to do that for the Zalzane quest
---
I just got randomly kicked from the server and upon reconnecting I have a 5 min wait with about 600 in front of me.
---
Hm okay I’m just lying then for no reason I guess, and you must be disabled to think servers will be dead looool
---
That's very likely to happen unfortunately.
---
I don't know if there are going to be transfers or merges, but if you're in.for the long game I'd take a very full server.
---
This is both awesome and devastating.
---
Awesome because it shows the sense of community.  I played WoW for a very long time, and most people I encountered were cool with each other.  The first online community I was really a part of.
---
Devastating because there's no way I would be able to spend my time in a game doing this.  I'm going to have to wait a week or two before I jump in.  Late start sucks, but I'm hoping it will be smoother this way.
---
Thanks.
---
Okay but how come that firemaw had the status 'full' and now has the status 'high'. All realms got basically a lower population then they had before launch
---
Can you play after adding just the Battlechest?
---
Oh no. You'll regret that soon when you check out the ah
---
You misspelled classic que
---
Myeah
---
I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the 4 new servers they added since it happened around the same time.
---
https://www.twitchmetrics.net/games/peak
---
I had a total blast for a few hours. I was scared it was rose tinted glasses. It was better than I remember
---
I play ganes like PoE and factorio so i dont think you could insult me with cod.
---
I didnt call you neckbeards because you bought game time early...
---
Your arrogant and negative attitude for no reason males me think you guys are the classical neckbeards.
---
me too, see ya tmrw hommie
---
I love it
---
The graphics are part of the experience. No need to fix it if it ain't broken.
---
Happened after an hour or so after launch, made it to level 5. In a way I was fine with it so others could get a start as well. Bedtime for me anyway.
---
Just got DCD :(
---
Please put him in the game as an NPC.
---
what I think happened is:
---
1) kalimdor crashed
---
2) 5k queue spots got filled
---
3) eastern crashed
---
so everyone who waited 8 hours and rolled undead, dwarf, human, gnome got dcd after 10 minutes
---
I last played pre TBC, I work now, married, studying for my degree part time and have our first  baby on the way.
---
Still giving it a go and excited for it, play a class that can solo reasonably well and find a laid back guild with members in a similar situation.
---
Maybe take me five times longer to reach 60 but will still enjoy the journey.
---
Maybe once your friends end up in the queue they'll concider rerolling
---
Easy to line up when the respawn timer is 5 seconds... Just you wait for zalazane
---
honestly tagging Sam is easier with good autoattack
---
Technically TBC joke

Silly
---
Horde?
---
Yes I had my nouns backwards lol, whoops.
---
No, trial is only for retail. Keep in mind that requirements are lower than BFA, if you're worried about overheating you can start with the lower settings (there's also a classic graphics option for original 2004 graphics) and see how it goes.
---
Looks like the rest of us should wait another week lol for this to cool down
---
Moving is not an option unfortunately.
---
I just want to avoid playing on a dead server in 3 months. Should I pick high or medium now then?
---
Doh, I noticed after I made the post lol. Already made my chars and been in the queue for 5 hours so going to stick it out lol
---
Not really. If it's medium you have no quetime.
---
It's more PVP and Normal, quetime doesn't matter.
---
Yep, guild died.
---
Git gud n00b
---
Nope, you and 50k other people can still catch his AFK stream right now. 
---
I'm intrigued by his plans on how to wake up when he gets back in
---
Pretty much everyone got kicked from the game.
---
Hmm thanks! Just dont want to play on a dead server 3 months from here
---
Is this game p2w like most MMORPG? I have played WoW private server with friends like 13 years ago for few months. That's about it. Can't remember anything.
---
Out of the 2 PvP servers in Oceanic at the moment, do people think one will eventually die off while the other prospers?
---
One has a queue of 600+ minutes while the other is an instant log in and that has me concerned that not many end game players will be playing for a long time on the instant log in server (I forget server names, my bad)

---
I got in but by the time I was it was so late and I was so tired I barely got through the starting area.
---
I love this. On our sever, they had people group up and only the group leaders stay in line. It works. Same for the scorpion claw. Group up and you can all get the drop together. Beats waiting 1 by 1.
---
New servers are the move. The four they implemented today have run quite smoothly.
---
Should’ve added an “at least” at the beginning. I’m not tied to any realm so I’ll take a rppvp with no queue if I have to
---
TLPD isn’t hard to get now, the same sharding that you guys are complaining about, if you use it smartly you can get as many TLPDs as you want.
---
20k+ on firemaw and 10k+ on most others.
---
I play on 2160p with everything maxed out and Im able to get 60 to 80 fps with a i5 9600k and RTX2070 :D 
---
In BFA I can´t even max out when I raid or many people are arround with this settings xD
---
It´s really funny how a game I played with a 500MB V-Ram card back then and now everything changed
---
Literally same.
---
Hey man that's true, wow classic is more about the journey anyways. Thanks man :)
---
What? No, that's not what happened. Several of my friends were kicked out and they were not cheating.
---
Yeah took my friend a good hour he said to renew his sub.
---
I think they put up a memo saying stores would be running slow at the moment.
---
What about now? You in yet?
---
"socializing"
---
I got in, made a friend in the first 20 mins and spent an hour queuing to kill Sarkoth. God damn it’s so much fun, so glad I got to play before work today.
---
I believe you are wrong. 
---
Server load fluctuation happens all the time in retail too. I'm not aware of the exact way it measures but it definitely doesn't count people that are offline and just have a character on the realm.
---
I guess we'll have to wait and see if its different again in prime-time.
---
Same, the struggle is real.  But I also don’t want to use three hours of the time i took off of work staring at a queue.
---
I wouldn’t mind the quest markers but hells no to the overlay showing exactly where to go.
---
and Legends become babies when the Corpsecamping goes too long and it just becomes pathetic
---
East Coast Grob Player here, and I’m not going anywhere. I’m sure there are others.
---
My mates and I were considering rerolling on Yojamba, but apparently its fucking cooked?
---
Argul is lagging as I type. Another DC may be incoming
---
Ya probably on the next re release in 15 years
---
The name alone will keep Sulfuras alive
---
Appreciate it man peace of minds a beautiful thing.
---
I mean mostly in general. Tagging the zombies and skeletons is a hassle as a mage with castspeed on everything as you start out.
---
But I suppose it wouldn't be classic without disappointment
---
Same happened to me.
---
Thanks so I just have to wait it out ?
---
Anyone have a working version of Trivia Bot?
---
Spicyboi. He is already a meme on Bloodsail Buccaneers. Spicyboi the filthy line cutter, cursed be his name. 
---
I heard the guy actually rerolled to escape the rep. It was spreading like wildfire. Everyone in Kalimdor was talking shit.
---
That's frustrating. I'd be in the same situation if the "nolifers" didn't decide to jump to Razorgore so they could play immediately. Now the rest just has to get the message and follow them.
---
You actually think you’ll be playing classic still in 2020?  Haha.

WHy you take all your food out the bag and put it on the table and take a picture of it.  That's weird as fuck bro.
---
Of course it's your fault, you could just speak English.
---
Ah ok. Haven't received an invite for 2 hours of playing and the moment I did I got kicked so may just be coincidence then
---
It’s easier than ever to get rare mounts BECAUSE of sharding.
---
In the same boat as you for now bud. 
---
Chose not to play during launch as well, my job is too important to me to sit there tired as hell. Going to try and get in this afternoon after work. Also going to try and play a bunch during my holiday next week.
---
Mooo
---
I was able to play all day on whitemane. Got dcd right as i hit lvl 12. Logged back into a 16k queue. Bed time
---
Don't worry about these goldmongers, OP, enjoy the experience!
---
Swim from the boat to the mountains and you can drown yourself and take rez sick to be alot of the walk considering the debuff doesn't apply below 10
---
I've been playing on it, a couple minutes ago things went fucky. Can't interact with things at the moment
---
Maybe still better than the queues of Arugal? Haha
---
Thanks for the info! Sounds like a really time consuming task. Do you know if it's really hard to farm the rep later in game instead?
---
Same haha
---
5100
---
Seems so, I personally would keep trying every now and then. 
---
You'll be waiting in a queue to play for hours It seems anyways!
---
cheers
---
Don’t know if it’s true, but my buddy said he thinks it’s an issue with DC’ing people on the Eastern Kingdoms. Said it’s happens twice. He finally got on and is taking his Undead to Durotar.

First night classic feels with work in the morning. Suffering now for my foolishness. I regret NOTHING.
---
Medium has more population than a full original vanilla, layering is there to allow much higher caps than normal (we don't know how much) and avoid dead realms when all the tourists leave.
---
I think its just a coincidence. Although very possible people have found a way to crash zones
---
Pick a different server, it’s less fair to kick people who have been leveling all day on the server and favor those who haven’t even logged in yet. Sucks, but the servers simply can’t have that many players on them
---
I was in queue and saw that! Suddenly dropped around 4k (11k -&gt; 7k in queue)
---
Releasing new servers hours after launch is a typical Blizzard move. Too little too late. No one is going to move after their guild is formed and half the people are leveling.
---
Why should Blizz do anything else? They said before launch there'd be large queues and people should move to a new server to avoid them.
---
People stayed, those same people complain about queues.
---
I haven't had more than 5 min total in queues in my 3 logins.
---
My brother just got back on after DCing about 4 hours ago. Worlds paying perfectly apparently.
---
Mograine had a 10k queue few hours ago. It will most probably have the same issue this evening. If that's not a problem it's ok, but I wouldn't really advice anyone rolling in it now.
---
Yeah but in that case you’re liking just going to SOAP into a 1 year pre-lim position and nothing more. You’ll get out and end up doing H&amp;Ps for insurance companies for a pittance...
---
Wow heroin so edgy
---
was on since the second it went online, now im in a 4k queue
---
Can my zenbook handle Classic?
---
Jesus man they literally just came out - give the realm some time to actually populate...
---
You don´t need a Battlechest, you just need a subscription then you can play classic
---
Mankrik had a line a well, for this and the scarlet commander
---
Given that game quality has gone pretty much backwards for the last 10 years, it might be the case that the best games ever made (at least in our lifetimes) have already been released. Indie gaming might save us, but indie devs have their own set of limitations.
---
alright thanks for that.
---
Yeah they added one more thankfully! Just have to see if people start to change to that. I looked but some of my names are gone on there now haha also got kicked after finally getting in after 7 hours, rip
---
Wow problems eh lol
---
"LIVE TO WIN!"
---
Yea eased up about 11. I must say that everyone seemed to really be enjoying it and there was a lively and friendly chat. I think they did a great job.
---
Can someone tell me what the estimated queue time of gehennas is?
---
my position in faerlina queue has been INCREASING for that last few minutes ;/
---
yeah thats pretty clear.  
---
hopefully its up soon
---
I can confirm this. I did the same!
---
Tailoring and enchanting is ideal tbh,
---
Got a DC at level 6 in the dwarf starting zone on EU server, I gave up
---
this is what Blizzard calls the Halfening --- Kick half the players off so the people sitting in queue can join.
---
Ive got like at least 25 toons to max throughout the years, on retail, on private servers, on x1, on x7, never one time since 1 or 2 has been much more than a snorefest. 
---
The only way I had much fun was RDF my way to max....
---
I doubt that level 10 twinking will be much of a thing. From TBC onwards you could actually compete in BGs against non-twinks, but Vanilla level 10s can't reach the same powerlevel - there's no busted crit/hit/haste/dodge rating multipliers to abuse.
---
This happend to me 2 times, with launch and now again.   
---
We're with a bunch of people playing and when we get DC'ed the others get in. they jump queue with like 2k spots.  
---
It's a real shame to be fair cause we were planning on playing together but it seems blizz doesn't want that.
---
No you.
---
308 rn.
---
been at &lt;1 minute to go for the last 10.
---
I feel so bad for you guys. I played for 9 hours and got disconnected from Whitemane about half an hour ago, looks like I'll be heading back shortly. I feel very lucky. Hang in there guys, this is the worst it'll be. At least you'll have some stories to tell about launch and how you got fucked over.
---
Bandage yourself while waiting for 5 second rule to kick in

In an mmo video game, I played a ranged class, and had to go buy ammunition.

It’s infuckingcredible how amazing that simple of an act is.

He constantly brags about ninja looting and griefing players back in vanilla through wrath. Not only is he proud if those moments but his viewers laugh and seem to think it's ok to emulate that. Dont lie and say theres no reason behind it. He's an asshole player, I doubt youd like to play with anyone on your server like that.
---
I dont mind any other big wow streamers.
---
Another mass DC on Firemaw into 5 hr+ ques. Whose idea was it to not include a grace dc period.
---
I pay roughly $30 for 1Gbps up/down. Praise our Swedish ISP overlords!
---
I play on the same server and it wasn't that long just an hour ago.
---
As far as I know cross realm bgs have already been confirmed by blizz. Does anybody know what the pool will be? Total playerbase / region / specific server groups?
---
Really? Yeah maybe you're right, I personally went to sleep when I randomly got dc'd 7 hours ago but at that time there were no queues. And here I was worrying Mograine was going to die out lmao
---
Not as long as you're okay with most guilds on the server doing things later at night than normal
---
I imagine a lot of people in NA are sleeping now so the servers have emptied out for the time being. I'd wait longer than the first twelve hours before judging on server population health, lol.
---
gosh i hope not
---
Sad I got dced just now, was about to loot a chest :(
---
Herod: Queued at 4:30 pm CDT, got in at 5:30 pm CDT. Played for 15 minutes, whole server dc'd. I was placed 8000~ in queue at roughly 5:50 pm CDT. Game ctd with no error one around 7:00 pm, I relaunched and got my place in queue which was around 4000 at this point. I leave to hit the bathroom, am gone for 5 minutes, game crashed again but this time I didn't get my place in queue back. I was now 20000+.
---
I finally got back into the game at roughly 1:50 am CDT. The servers dc'd everyone in Mulgore 15-20 minutes later. It's 2:20 AM, I am now 4500 in queue.
---
I give up. I took a week off of work, prepped so much around the house to spend this entire week grinding, and the first day I'm 15 levels behind my group. My will is broken.
---
11k here, claiming 13min
---
Have watched the video for like 15 times this morning, still massive goosebumps.
---
There is hopefully a spotify (and longer!) Version available soon.
---
Of course! I understand it's very early. I'm just saying that there are a lot of servers up now and it's a gamble of which ones are eventually gonna go dead, so just wondering if Blizzard will compensate for the servers that were ultimately unnecessary!
---
2nd dc at lvl 10.. bedtime
---
It JUST happened to me and now im in a 8k queue
---
my life is over
---
Almost everyone in that video is a cameo, so i don't think any of them really qualify as a cameo tbf... ;)
---
Common sense man.
---
Isn't that consider huge for Iceland?
---
Tailoring has some nice craftables at max level. Most people pair it with Enchanting but you could take a gathering profession (Herbalism/Mining/Skinning) for extra cash
---
I feel like this is not intentional. Beyond me remembering I’ve done it, I remember a popular clip that went around if that famous shaman PVPer doing retail ranked arenas and toggling to classic to auto run somewhere and back to retail to continue arena, I also have a very vague memory of playing hearthstone with retail open.
---
&gt; And here I was worrying Mograine was going to die out lmao
---
Lol no don't worry about that ;)
---
2k people dc'd a few minutes ago when my q spot went from 4800's to 2800s
---
As if I wasn't hyped enough... now there's a trailer with THE Matt Mercer, the most famous man alive. 
---
Wow.
---
I had a huge queue, my friends and I switched to a new server, got in immediately and played for 5 hours with no issues.
---
If you didn't expect launch to go this way idk what to tell you. Literally every major MMO launch since the dawn of time and this is the majorest of MMO launches.
---
While enchanting/tailoring might be best, it's probably worth checking out MadSeason's videos on Classic professions. He talks about how each one does for different classes and how much gold you can make from them.
---
Ask for a refund if it upsets you this much.
---
I paid too. Haven’t tried to log in yet. BECAUSE I knew this was going to happen. You should’ve expected it and if you didn’t, sorry,  you’re dumb.
---
Lucky! i just got a random d/c and got put back in the queue....
---
My original queue estimate was 8 minutes. It took me about 31 to get in.
---
Seriously my very first experience as a tank in WoW (it was before TBC but not immediately after launch) was me being all nervous about pulling and almost ready to hit charge when I see a huge fireball flying past me and hitting the mob. I learned my lesson quickly and now let anyone die who pulls before I do (when I'm tanking) done it like this until and through Pandaria and will keep it like that.
---
I can't share your nostalgic view on passt WoW, there was already then little communication, chaos and impatient mages and warlocks and I have my doubts this changed, if anything it got worse. Just because the game is now in Classic mode does not mean people return to being decent and sociable human beings.
---
200 IQ move right there
---
Fuuuuuck bro that’s a yikes
---
Yeah yeah, I understand it's very soon! I'm more so asking theoretically to those who know how Blizzard usually work, if they'd do realm transfers if it happens I've picked a server that will die out after the initial hype!
---
if we had the option, before we queued for 5 hours and then played for a few, we might have switched.  
---
its too late now, unless they wanna give us character transfers to hop off this train
---
Weird. I was enjoying the game
---
Why? Some people legit don't care about Classic and that's ok.

thank god for that one loud ass floorboard, i swear my dad would step on it on purpose just so i would have time
---
LOL I heard this image
---
Welcome to the classic experience. They warned you about this beforehand. How you didn't see this coming boggles my mind. Maybe roll at a less populated server.
---
shit fucking launch. people are still defending them, though
---
Relax.  This is to be expected of an event this big in the making.  Besides, Blizzard is good with giving players free play time when this stuff happens.  So yes, they are going to compensate your entitled ass.
---
Same thing happened to me, got in queue at 8:10am, got into server at 4:30pm - disconnected at 5pm, now back in the queue.
---
Sigh
---
Awesome, ty
---
They have buttons that you can make to do a list of things, so you could switch a while gearset with one click or make the button say to shape shift and then do X.

It won't ever auto trigger anything you still have to activate the command.

---
Same. Random DC while questing, instant relog - directly into queue.
---
Wah, people are okay the game I want to play! Give me a refund! Wah! Grow up
---
Any helpful console commands that I should know, like the one for the camera zoom?
---
Nost prepared me for dis
---
Oh, the game is great but they could have managed the logistics of it significantly better.
---
I wouldn't have bet a dollar against someone's $50 that the servers would instantly come up on time and be playable. Not only that, launch was scheduled for 6PM EDT and my phone clock said 5:59 when the Enter World button lit up.
---
Had a solid 9 hours of gameplay till the disconnect a lot of people got hit with just now. It's close enough to bed time that I'm not upset. I wonder what the queues will be like on Faerlina going forward and for how long they keep up.
---
Good luck, lol. 
---
It’s in the TOS that stuff this can happen and there’s no recourse.
---
¿Que?
---
If realms are dying they said in the AMA they will consider free transfers. That said, a Low pop means way more people than Low back in Vanilla so it could be fine.
---
That's not how it works, though. How would I know to look for a skip, if I had no idea that a skip existed?
---
Getting a payment error whilst trying to subscribe. 
---
Link to Blizz twitter where they say its resolved however i've tried two cards with no luck. 
---
Anyone else experience this?
---
I don't think that's what this is about at all. It's about the whole ritual everyone went through, hype and excitement was building for a while. Now they can't "just play" when they've been expecting to for a while, they're understandably disappointing.
---
That content has been done in the past doesn't address any of the social and emotional aspects of the problem people are experiencing
---
Great day for my payments to stop working on Blizzard.
---
Guess no WoW today :(
---
Yup, waited in the queue for 8 hours (while at work), 5 minutes into playing and the server shat itself. Now back at 6k queue. Would change server but my guild all rolled Arugal and some are now level 16 and understandably aren’t keen to switch servers.
---
Basically lead to me dropping out of community college. Got my shoulders though, season 2.
---
Too many people I'm playing with that I can't communicate a last second change to unfortunately.
---
Looks like Blizz reset the queue for him because he is back on with 80k followers.
---
Guy is trying to sell a name for real money, it's against the ToS.. Why can't I report him?
---
If I can't report him then why don't I just go and sell a load of names?
---
Do you have a source for that? As far as I know, they won't.
---
Just FYI, by level 13 you can get [Greater Magic Wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11288/greater-magic-wand) which is much better.
---
Yea i know and the funny thing is that i am positive about both versions cuz i think there is something for everybody
---
My base 2013 MacBook Pro runs it perfectly fine. And by it I mean wow in general, not just classic cause I haven’t got on yet, and retail has higher requirements than classic
---
Look up his old 'ninja loot' video.
---
Because we want long term server stability
---
Yep I got in that way. Gotta be ahead of the curve.
---
With what, the grand total of 30min of work I need to do in an 8h timespan? 
---
;)
---
So the comment section of this subreddit, full of people from this subreddit, isn't representative of the subreddit? Fascinating
---
I'm with you, this guy is a damn goblin
---
ah, I figured it out. have to add a payment method on account page. won't work if you try to add it after clicking subscribe
---
literally had never seen a line until people did it during the stress test. Why people would put themselves through this is beyond me. I like to play wow not wait in a line to participate in the game
---
Honestly, I expected a queue, but I rolled on Zandalar Tribe, and there was no wait at all.
---
It's all part of the process! We all knew there would be crazy queue times! :P
---
I remember when I fished it with my hunter in Darkshore 13 years ago. What an awesome feeling !
---
Firemaw is full, where have you seen that it's population is different?
---
just to be clear my sister is the pride of this family not me, im the other guy  
---
and also it was taurens and not elves, sheesh
---
It's not just about last night.. First 2 EU pvp servers, then 2 more later and then a few days ago 4 more.. People had no chance to cordinate server choices and literally all pvp servers having 10+ people in que, thats just not good enough.
---
Here, read this, maybe it'll clarify things for you https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw11nk/did_you_guys_know_you_can_like_classic_without/ey7nlq1/
---
Yeah we jumped ship and still had 15k ques lol
---
I'm here for it
---
Remember to pick up your phone next time it rings Henry! You don't want to almost lost out on another movie.
---
All the normal servers are at low population right now. Seems they unlocked tiers so there wouldn't be 5000 people in the starting zone at launch
---
But Yojamba has no queue, unlike the 11k queue of Argul
---
This sub is actually a bigger circlejerk than r/wowcirclejerk
---
had the exact same sitch as you, currently at 1500 on arugal waiting to get back in.
---
I guess so, it's just that it might be tedious if I want to catch up in spells. Just trying to decide where my friends and I will level.
---
I expected a queue.  Not hours and hours of waiting kind of a queue.  I don’t think that’s appropriate for s game that’s charging monthly.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
because blizzard doesnt like idiots that buy a mac for 10k $ that cant handle any game in 60 fps
---
Lets say a new server allows even 5,000 people (a conservative estimate) to play for a month. That's $75,000 before taxes and expenses. I think that leaves enough left over to front us the extra month and give the playerbase the benefit of the doubt.
---
I had way more than that on my layer I can’t believe I forgot to screenshot
---
It's one thing I wish classic got tbh.
---
was in since the servers launched (arugal PVP oceanic) and got kicked out. entered the queue at 8700 about 40 minutes ago, currently sitting at 2155.
---
Ask yourself what kind of people enjoy memes.
---
Hey, you like what you like. Gamers have to stick together IMO. We all love the same hobby, just different flavours
---
Petition to rename this sub r/wowcirclejerkbutreal
---
Same with whitemane !
---
you barely even waited
---
It drags you along. Then punches you in the face with feels. Honestly they are right. Two of the best episodes of the show.
---
That gnome went all the way to Teldrassil to meet up with his buddies. Mad props!
---
It’s not a random Tauren, it’s Gamon. The one who will save us some expansions later.
---
Your point of people don't talk about it is just plain wrong, and honestly the longer this discussion goes on the more you're proving the point lol
---
could be 10k if u checked "remember accountname" and just type in your passwort instead of restarting wow
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Perfection
---
Just traded a guy the silver and cloth to make my last 2 bags and BAM! Server lag, 10 mins later server crashed and logged back in to a 10.5k queue
---
Answer the question, don't divert. Are the people on this subreddit, (4.8k of them via upvotes by the way) representative of the subreddit? Yes or no
---
actually no, not before today. this kind of thing never happened in actual vanilla.
---
it looks to me like too many people didn't actually play it and have only read about it, leading to stuff like this happening that weren't part of the actual 2004-2006 community at all.
---
but it's nice so far, personally I only played for 10 min and have already had more social interaction than in 3 last retail expansions put together.
---
Pro Tip: Just skip that quest, unless it really has somethin you want. Your speed leveling guide didn't account for lines. Go explore and discover something else. But if it got that dagger you need, i guess your fucked.
---
grace my ass. i went to grab something out the fridge and pee, as i started peeing i heard the login music in my headset and was put back in a queue logging in 10 seconds later. '
---
thanks blizzard peed all over the floor 1/10
---
Well honestly, gives one thing every 3 minutes to dozens of people. They'll lottery try to tab auto attack with only 1% to get the mob with new players joining lowering the stats to oblivion
---
OR you just try to get something in place for everyone to get a nice experience and fair experience. Forming a queue is just unfair at the beginning as some people have to accept they ain't gonna be first or second, but everyone wins from that in the end.
---
Same, Gandling had no queue at all... but I only played for about an hour before going to bed. As hyped as I am for classic it's not worth going to work feeling like death, haha.
---
This is normal day 1 stuff people.
---
BFA deserves all the moaning it gets, imo.
---
European region isnt Blizzards strong point. Not that weird tbh. They normally forget we exist at least once a week.
---
It was amazing last night. Players everywhere being courteous and patient.
---
Absolutely worse in every human starting zone.
---
Casuals and spikes alike, fancy those good ole' humans.
---
Yes. Is this Westfall server? I was blown away at the manners! I even got a group invite right when I asked?
---
Questie (:
---
Yeah servers went down for a bit
---
Questie - can be downloaded from : [https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev)
---
This may be hard for you to grasp but the world does not stop turning once you turn around. Guilds still exist, the game still goes on  and  there are still thousands of guilds running mythic raids. There is a reason most long standing guilds only recruit outside of release windows because you minimise the chance of someone joining who will be gone 2 months later.
---
I sure as hell hope so. With all these problems with the launch I'd like the idea of one free character transfer as it would allow the players who did play to continue playing with friends that made characters on other servers in order to play the game. I understand the progress they've been TRYING to make but I'd really love it if this were to happen.
---
depends. do you enjoy challenge, or do you shy away from complexity that is sometimes not necessary? you will be frustrated at times. it will feel like an older game without the polish modern games have.
---
Well taste differs. I find him very, very funny and relaxing. But I've been watching him since his youtube days.
---
The point is you came to a CLASSIC SUBREDDIT and expected to find people that like BFA. You earned the title of simpleton.
---
Okay i may be wrong about that the guilds going or not. I just started picturing the player i play and raid with and knowing what makes them like retail and play it and i can't just imagine them really enjoying it but then again this my experience with my group of online mates.
---
Damn true, im a proud eastern eu guy now

Lucifron (german pvp server)
---
I hope you get on today/tonight dude, it's well worth the wait!
---
PVP server is kill atm. I finished work at 6am, been in a queue all day? Finally got on and got DC'd.. back into the queue.. there's another low pop pvp server tho
---
Right next to the warlock trainer generally. Try inn basement.
---
Yup, me n my buddy DCed same time from fairbanks
---
Be glad ure not on firemaw. U get randomly dced and then put in 2hour queue.
---
You paid to play the game, not to skip all the queues.
---
Do you also moan and whine when you stand in queue to board a plane? To pay for your groceries? Do you expect a refund on your car when you sit in traffic on your way to work?
---
You get to play. Once you're at the front of the queue.
---
Hi, Im trying to use questmonkey and its not marking any quest locations on my map, anyone know what I'm doing wrong? I looked online and all i found was to click eyeglass in main maps but that doesn't seem to be there anymore.
---
In terms of difficulty i'm ready to handle it
---
marry that woman. MARRY HER NOW!!!!!
---
I had a keyboard issue that required me to exit the game. Hopped right back in twice while my friends had about 30 min queues at the same time.

Play a reasonable amount, but do your goddam real world obligations. This guy is a fucking moron. This is a fucking game, it's not a mystical experience.
---
Yes. There are even guides made specifically for groups of 2+ players.
---
I had the exact same thing happen on firemaw, it was a sad moment.
---
Oh wow. I was in that guild and the raid. What was your char name?
---
Need a baby translator. I don't know what he's trying to sayn.
---
It took my group two hours to clear Northshire and we had to skip Garrick because there was no chance on getting the first hit when he spawned.
---
I didn't expect you lot to like BfA, but you can like classic without your sub being turned into the laughing stock circle jerk it is lol
---
What is this from?
---
/1 Friendly person looking for guild!
---
Some will be bad and some will be great, you wont know until you hop in and start chatting with people
---
press shift when hovering over an item.
---
You could use zygore which points you in the right direction and shows what you need to kill / loot but it has a monthly sub of about $12 iirc.
---
Blizzard experience,same shit happened with wod and bfa relase.
---
People would form a line if you activated windows
---
Yet adults can schedule holidays. And I did.
---
Rationalizing with someone who's crying over their support of BfA is futile, it's much easier to point out where your argument is wrong and send a simpleton on their way.
---
&lt;3
---
Had to wait 15 minutes, got in and started to kill boars as an orc rogue. It felt very real and very WoW, unlike retail(which I still love, it just isn't the same game). Only had an hour but got out of the valley of trials and can't wait to really dive into the game this week!
---
Layering
---
I'd absolutely love to see him made into an NPC on the Classic realms, but I feel like that'd be a bit too much of a hit to J. Allen Brack's ego to be considered.
---
It's not like the lovable Red Shirt Guy, just casually making them aware of a lore inconsistency, it's a guy who asked a perfectly reasonable question only to be belittled by the Blizzard reps.
---
Yours is the conspiracy, the point of that is you have to prove it.
---
I had friends who got dced and friends who played 6+ hours tonight.
---
Yeah, its rough, but which wow launch isnt? Makes me glad I didn't take the day off.
---
Could just read the quest text too. Takes all of 10 seconds.
---
Definitely incompetent of blizzard to have such few initial servers in their first round. I had to abandon a number of promising guilds because they somehow had the foolish notion that 2 (here in Eu) was gonna be enough. They decided shazz and called it final... the poor sods. From the looks of it barely any of em got to play, and it’s more blizzards fault than anything else. 2 fking servers? What were they thinking. It’s one thing to estimate interest and add servers running my, but I would have bet you my house 2 wouldn’t be enough and that has now royally fucked the first few realms.
---
In other words, a simpleton and a troll. Thank you for admitting it.
---
I’m also wonder that low population realm will be empty after the hype ends :(
---
I went to the pve server. Bugger that.
---
On release or at all the first week!
---
Low pop servers will still have more players than active realms in vanilla.
---
His meltdown was the best part of my night. Thank you so much Blizzard.
---
I actually think blizzard intentionally kicked a lot of players for above reason last night, to avoid some types of whining on the net.
---
He still has a point. Layering didn't he one problem they were supposed to fix. Launch was unplayable. We should've just got more servers. Even just 4-5 more per region would solve all problems.

But sir, I pointed out also where your argument is wrong, are you also a simpleton who must be asked to depart forthwith?

Ofcourse it is stressed, but we have seen stressed servers with DCs without putting you abck in the line before.

What kind of drugs are you using to stay awake for 54 hours straight?
---
Which class are you playing?
---
Same thing happened on Alliance side in Dun Morogh. Single file lines for respawning quest items. Never seen anything like it.
---
i had like a 15 min wait time a few hours ago, and the servers just came out, a bunch of people prolly won't hop on for a day or so.
---
very cool! I waited 8 hours to play 10 minutes and get dcd.

It's a meme about classic, unfortunately which does poke fun at BfA. And memes about retail do get deleted constantly. Again, go ahead and report it if it's not about classic.

I just got off work myself, I got enough screenshots from my buddies while I was at work, they deserved the DC lol

Now is my time!

Arms for leveling with a 2h. Fury dual wield for raiding DPS. 
---
You can tank leveling dungeons as arms with proper gear.
---
If you plan to tank end-game you can either go full prot or do a Fury/Prot Hybrid.
---
None I'm just crazy
---
The burden of proof is on you, jackass.
---
Go to interface options and set loot window at cursor
---
Just arrived at work, can relate.
---
But hopefully we'll experience less queue than other realms my fellow Razorgorian
---
Imagine going to an amusement park and having to wait in line for the attractions, oh wait ...
---
I want that server lol... my server was chaos
---
Bigglesworth didn't disappoint. Got in at launch, and just logged off at lvl 14. One d/c and got in in less than a minute wait at 600 queue.
---
THIS &lt;3

I started WOW in TBC (yeah im not the cool vanilla guy), and it's the best game i've played to date. But now i have a 3 year old son, getting a daughter in one month.

And lets say that my gametime went down A LOT.   
---
But... i will do my best to join you guys again. Even if it's for five hours a week.   
---
See you in Azeroth, old and new friends.
---
Yeah, you're kinda falling apart dude, try harder next time and you might almost get somewhere. First all posts get deleted if to do with BFA, then there was no post with that many upvotes about BFA, now it's all a big mistake

OH NO NO NO NO NO IMAGINE

thanks, i literally looked everywhere

its dumb cuz i swore i looked there

Normal servers are PvE but you still have the option to access PvP content.
---
The thing with PvP servers is just that as a new player getting ganked a lot can make it frustrating especially when learning the game solo
---
I’m an adult that was willing to switch to one of the lower pop servers and I got to level 13...
---
Don’t be a stubborn adult and you can play.
---
What the hell is even that
---
This was going on prior to the realmstarts, some mentioned they had success using mobile
---
ofc we know that and me and my friends were already changed server to new one at beginning for avoid ques
---
and i got dc'd man. i don't wanna move to other server alone.
---
Okey guys. Isn’t it true that all group members can loot the quest item ONLY IF it’s a single mob quest?? I tried it on the test realm and my whole group was able to loot the head of that one quilboar in the tauren starting area.
---
Knowing this would greatly increase the leveling for all players. We just have to confirm it first.
---
You posted a meme that's about classic and BfA, and it's not a top 3 post in the subreddit. Keep thinking you're right though, simpleton.
---
The hooded saint?
---
My god, he's Tyrael!
---
If you do engineering and go Enhancement until early 50s, you can bang with the best of them.   On a certain server, I was killing red druids in Hillsbrad.
---
you don't have to buy that. You get the base game for free with a subscription. Just subscribe for a month and play classic.
---
No it dosent when you have 40+ people from different friend groups, people have to work and release in EU was at 00.00.. I cant belive how you people can be so fucking dense. You probably had 3 friends to coordinate with..
---
Most guilds, people with many friends and all that stuff has a hell of a lot of things to consider when chosing a realm and it is not a fairytale land as you guys think.
---
My Surface Pro can, classic can run on a potato
---
You think you don t but you do x)
---
You managed to avoid error 37? Lucky you. 
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/error-37
---
Everyone should be thanking the develops of Nostalrius. Without them, we wouldnt have this.
---
Now that the discussion is essentially over, allow me to say that your argumentative skills could use a little work. Words like simpleton make people not take you seriously, and if your argument back makes your opposition look right, you might wanna rephrase it. Have a fab day!
---
It's a post about both, and I said there's no top 3 post about BfA which there isn't. Troll better next time.
---
Again, are the posts and comments of this subreddit representative of it or not? You still haven't answered, ignoramus
---
No fucking way I'd wait for all these fools. Ain't got time fo dat
---
That's what monopolies do.
---
That’s the plan! 👌🏽 we just leveled a mage and a warrior to lvl 5 and she’s loving it lol
---
Episode is called The Battle of the Bastards (S6E9).
---
That is a short queue
---
Like every popular theme park ever?
---
Bye troll
---
Yeah leveling was so easy today. I can not make wool bags even if anyone had wool lying around
---
Are you respecing to fury after 60 for raid content?
---
The thing is the quests all tell you exactly where you need to go or what you need to be looking for. Many are precise and dead-on with what to do/where you need to be, but some give a general sense of direction. Much like how you might get one in real life - "It's up to the north east from here, but if you make a right at the end of ABC road you should find it". I never needed to Google a damn thing back when I played in Vanilla because I took a hot second to skim the text of the quest. 5 seconds, all it takes, and a mindset of exploration and smelling the roses and not treating the game like a job, where efficiency is the quintessential essence of the product.
---
But the choice is yours. In the end you'll probably find someone to team up with on PvP servers and that's what WoW is all about. It's brutal but that incentives social interaction
---
I've done it at level 1-6 about 75% of the times I played Nelf in classic. (and the other times I'd just stay there)
---
My server is allways that empty \*sad\*
---
This server will just be a bunch of rogues stealthed and waiting for someone to show themselves.
---
Ratchet has warlock trainers in or near a tower up the hill from the bank (I think adjacent to the observatory where you get quests and train Engineering).
---
Even worse than 2004? 
---
Please expand on this with fair and accurate comparisons from the launch of 2004 and today

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw1baa/should_i_be_worried_about_my_server_going_from/). 
---
And we get a free transfer to their server 2 months from now.
---
In that specific post? It's probably a bunch of bitching from people like you and people that disagree with you.
---
I joined a server that launched 5 hours before they started and had no issues except for some lag spikes the first hour.
---
well u understood I meant queue so that is good
---
Real classic experience
---
This guys is going for the real classic experience, even started some classes he could fail to get that nostalgia feeling juuuuust right. But seriously good luck!!
---
Can you back up that they are? From a developer point of view they would have to persist the user id somewhere and say "this person got on 5 minutes ago so let them back in if they try login". They obviously haven't developed the login workflow to do this. It's just launch day and this stuff happens - you'll forget all about it in a few days where you can login easily.
---
I highly doubt it  Why the hell would they bother with that at launch?  Ruining everyone's experience. Plus the botters are probably waiting for stable servers and less crowded zones anyway.
---
I really lucked out on this one. I called in general, whether there was a group. No answer. Saw some guy coming away from there having probably just completed it.
---
Arrived, 1.5 mins he respawned, no-one else around. Tapped, killed, moved on.
---
I also got to Skeletons at a good time it seems. Finished that in no time. Saw around 10mins later, they were being tapped within a second of spawning every time.
---
I dont wanna sound like a douche but my group and I got in at 6 and only lagged for the first 10 min when the starting zone was overcrowded, then it went smoothly until one mass DC 9 hours in, where we all got back in instantly. This is on Blaumeux, and a bunch of other realms were "low" when we logged back in. Are people not going on the new low servers?
---
We're still left with the best game ever made?
---
Hi, /u/yepyep1997

---
True. I hope I won't have to change to even low pop server. :/ Can't stand waiting in lines IRL, thus in game same, waste of time, unless you have something else to do, but still, I want to play instantly I get back from work.
---
So you are upset that somthing happend that everyone knew would happen just wait a week and enjoy it then when the tourists are gone
---
And they make money on that how? Ads?
---
Idk me and 5 of my friends came back because of classic. I haven’t played wow since BC. So yeah I won’t be on WoW outside of this experience.
---
We only have one PvP server.....
---
Unless you saw it I'm a post from blizzard is just a rumor really. I think the only way there was shut it down as if majority of people stop playing.
---
You never mentioned 'top 3' whatsoever, if you're making a point provide me the evidence you asked for only a top 3 post
---
I would really love to see them give character transfers
---
tried that already didn't work
---
&gt;Are people not going on the new low servers?
---
We had 70+ people from multiple communities arranged to join one of the old servers. Then Blizzard launched new ones.
---
Do you know how hard it is to get in touch with every person again and decide to switch?
---
EU has 4 full PvP realms and 4 low. And that's because we couldn't make arrangements for realms we didn't know will exist and its very hard to change arrangements now.
---
That being said we are trying to coordinate a move to one of the new realms but in the back of our minds is always the chance that we might end up in a dead realm.
---
The whole situation in EU has been a massive error in planning.
---
Wtf is this stupid ass comment?
---
There's some indications at least. It appears to happen to a layer at a time, and it's happening on every server with a big queue.  
---
Then there's the reconnect windows getting removed.  
---
Not definitive proof or anything.  
---
And it does make sense for Blizzard to do something like this. Disconnecting a player who's played for 6 hours is arguably better for your reputation than your subscribers not being able to play AT ALL.
---
Stonks
---
Why would they calm down?
---
&gt;  threat meter
---
I'd recommend one of those regardless
---
It's more fun for streamers to play with their friends which coincidentally are also streamers
---
And you get to enjoy the sight of one of the coolest places in the game (valley of kings)
---
Does anyone know what is the current status of speed levelers? Is any of them streaming?
---
Still? Happens last night so I went to bed, but do they still DC you?
---
Just wait till you get the [red woolen sack](http://www.gucomics.com/comic/?cdate=20040402).
---
100% close it down
---
I can certainly see these arguments and I would agree BFA has numerous flaws. My post was about the subreddit more than BFA itself. Azerite especially I do not enjoy, feels very clunky and largely unrewarding although essences somewhat helped the second part. I do feel like lore wise, and story (Sylvanas weirdness aside) wise it will be a very MOP type expansion. Appreciated more a while after it's passed when everybody doesn't have to do the grinds and can just do the story to level through
---
The streamers decided that together so people could have a “genuine” classic experience on Herod. There was a thread about it a few weeks ago.
---
Where do you learn journeyman tailoring? I'm 75/75 and cant level up any more. Alliance, level 10.
---
You think the original was it's best version? Lol
---
das rite!
---
Who is currently the highest level? This Naowh guy on Twitch is level 19 right now.
---
What nice EU pvp server should i go without 10k Q, a nice community ?... And not dead in few weeks ?!
---
yeah and its barely crawling
---
LOL
---
I'm hardstuck at positon 3000 with 60 minutes to go...
---
The WoW art team is so above and beyond all the other departments it's borderline embarassing. Every expansion they deliver beyond expectations, it's always top tier quality. They deserve competant gameplay devs.
---
My main? It has to be whichever race supports the class best. 
---
Any and all alts? Whichever frame looks best in the armor.
---
It's not douchey, it's just dramatic.
---
It is ridiculuos on German servers. I went from the first PVP to the new one Venoxis to avoid queues and now I have them again.
---
It isn't, pick what you want. If a raid has to base their decisions on racials, they're a bad raid anyway.
---
Yooo this a video game
---
I reserved my name on every server 4 hours before launch :)
---
Try to play without your add-ons will solve this problem ;-)
---
ooh I wonder if the authenticator core hound will be there? Would it just be in my bag?
---
For the Alliance
---
Show me where you said they had to be the top three. I used 'a' thread numerous times. The 'the' in that individual statement is quite clearly because the sentence 'two of a top threads' doesn't make grammatical sense, and if you can't identify that, you need even more work than I thought
---
i wonder how that guy feels right now
---
Not definitive. Correct.
---
Why are people waiting this long for queues? Blizzard is offering server xfers in the coming future...
---
\#dedication
---
Seems top happen when an DC occurs, Discord mentioned a DC when I checked my queue and it dropped from 4000+ to under 100. 
---
Beginning to think it's deliberate to switch out players lol.
---
To clarify: from a low pop server to a high pop server later on (after the queue is gone)
---
Same here!  I’m in no rush to get to 60.  Molten core isn’t going anywhere.  Ragnaros will be there when I get there.  In the meantime, I forgot how much fun this game could be and I just had a blast reminiscing and falling back in love with it all over again.
---
Cross-realm BG's have indeed been confirmed, but there has been no announcement on the groupings yet.
---
My guess is that Blizzard will wait until they can pull accurate faction balance data before they decide.
---
It feels dense even with the layers, there’s still an abundance of players to play with and chat too.
---
No, because people payed money and it’s not a free game or an indie company.
---
I had 8000 queue and it said 6 min, now straight back up to 115 min, RIP.
---
nope. have to wait till morning reset
---
hotfix coming when they reset servers at 7am pst. check blizz twitters before posting here bro
---
Same here, super useful
---
It’s /console scriptErrors 0
---
You’d probably get more from just doing the shortcut and getting back to leveling.
---
i can see damage, healing does not show. The addon advanced options shows it, but the option wont stay on.
---
THEY’RE OUTNUMBERED 15 TO ONE
---
Man I was waiting all day, finally got in but had this "the world will soon become available" message and it was at the character screen. I left it there, got in the Uber and it let me log in. So lucky.
---
My head is a-swiveling.
---
Is that like, through steppes &amp; gorge?
---
Brisbane my man
---
Text in spanisb says: "I pay the next round, buddies"
---
I think the server status broke all over the place lots of eu servers are low pop but still have queue times
---
ElvUI
---
Imagine being this guy
---
Mine was full with no queue.
---
No information is out afaik. But from the dev's engagement so far I trust they will do the right thing when the time comes.
---
as if the power just went off after 2 hours in the queue :)
---
Nice thanks !
---
&gt; Show me where you said they had to be the top three.
---
I listed three, gave you leeway on your initial argument, and you were still wrong. Anything else, simpleton?
---
First to tag, first to serve
---
I started as undead priest and i cant accept quests, any help
---
I appreciate it but are you sure I heard a lot of stuff where people refuse your join because your not the right race is there plenty that do?
---
Couldn’t agree more. At 4:30am BST, I found a group for Hogger within seconds, and spent the best part of an hour trying to get Blue Armbands from Gnolls with a group of 5 fighting to win the spawns against other players... 
---
... **And this was on *Gandling***
---
You mean the boat thats helping funding classic?
---
Is this a horror movie
---
Zandalar Tribe didn't have queues. Got in at 00.00 sharp and so did my friends. Feel bad for the rest of you (a tiny bit). Hopefully it will clear up soon.
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
Under normal circumstances is say reboot... Today I say live with it.
---
Shit. I hardly noticed it was 4 am lol. Nvm
---
So I should have a main first then a alt that is what I like more?
---
Just wait a bit and your character will get booted off eventually
---
spend your money in a week from now, no surprise that a bunch of people want to cram in today
---
sounds fun actually
---
Why would you ask to calm down anyway?
---
It should be obvious that we waited a long time for this of course everyone is hyped.
---
Yet again Blizz underestimated play demand.
---
I have no understanding for people that did not move away from a high pop server.
---
But what I can't understand is when I move to a the only other pvp server there is for german players because the other one is FULL and then I am stuck in a 20min queue everytime I get disconnected even though it is a Medium Realm.
---
Got my Druid some kodo skin bags 😺
---
Genau :]
---
Mograine.
---
Same story here, hang in there buddy.
---
Hi, /u/Niqqa_101

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw1hao/ayy_its_my_cake_day/). 
---
I ended up switching to a low population server because Herod was an absolute shitshow, the queue got as high as 23,000
---
Going with starting zone chat its just streamer drama and fake newbie questions. Combat log was more interesting.
---
Zero wait time on Skeram. Logged out, shit, showered and went back to check log times.... I went right in.
---
When it gets to the point of raids forming, it’s more about the skill than the race/class. Unless you’re going for server firsts or something it doesn’t make that big of a difference.
---
Again, any raid that mandates racial abilities is either going for first kills or really bad and not worth raiding with. There will be plenty of guilds that are capable of clearing content with any racial ability, as long as they have the appropriate gear/pots/buffs.
---
Right? Damn zoomers
---
Maybe. Don't forget that there is quite a bit of media coverage as well, so that also helps bring in new players, and i think we will see a steady stream of new players and depending on the dropoff it could get rather big. 
---
Personally i think this is as close as to wow 2.0 we are going to get and tbh i expect the numbers to remain quite large, simply because of the social aspect and it still being WoW.
---
I refuse to watch this. Just can’t.
---
They haven't promised it but definitely said it was a possibility.
---
If it's the same as retail, it'll just be servername-name so u keep it
---
It was the correct choice, when the tourists leave one server will be just fine.
---
You can be fat and ugly and still take a shower lol
---
That is because even a medium server has more players than a full server back in the Day
---
Good thing I don't live in reality.
---
Pretty well every server is over populated, Blizzard dropped the ball hardcore.
---
Useless company that couldn't organise their way out of a wet paper bag
---
The name reservations for the new servers opened 5 hours before launch
---
How do addons from twitch work? will they work on both classic and bfa or do i need different versions
---
I've read that the best is to go as fury until lvl 40 and then switch to arms.
---
You need to buy the game first (comes with 30 days playtime)
---
Praise our lord and saviour, Deano. He helps us all, he gives us hope.
---
Ah, I got that wrong then, sorry
---
One might think this small indie company would have learned something in 15 years.....
---
Yes, but we living in 2019 and blizzard is still in 2004. It’s not some indie company, they are over their heads.
---
This is nothing, it was 35k earlier! Ugh!
---
3 men in black suits tossed him in the trunk of a car after Blizzcon. They drove to a empty warehouse in the desert of Nevada not far from Area 51. He used vanish and escaped but have been hiding in a bunker in the middle east without any outside information, not aware of the vanilla progress.
---
It means another layer was just provisioned or lots of people dc'd.
---
Why do quests when you can be out killing? Deploy KMMO tactics
---
lol that was my plan and reaction as I wait for my coffee to brew.
---
Where'd it go?
---
Props for him for not trying to plug his guild or anything. Just ask the question, no bullshit.
---
You listed three of the numerous top posts and that means you're right? How pathetic, you never specified to me I could only use the top three. Burden of proof is on the accuser, darling, and you have none of it
---
By a guy standing in front of a Warlords of Draenor display. That's possibly the greatest sin of all.
---
&gt;You don't want classic, look how good WoD is! You can go to your little single player facebook game castle hideout and tell your followers to do your quests for you!
---
Pass.
---
When does phase 3 release again?
---
Ive heard people who cut the line becomes wanted. Have fun getting corpse camped!
---
It is so absurd to play today. Not buying a sub until the situation stabilizes
---
Most likely just a bag due to blizzard webservices getting hammered by traffic. Just try agsin later
---
come on, don't use this scene. it still makes me sad.
---
I'm sorry to hear that man. That's a double whammy. Losing two people like that can create quite a void. I hope you're doing ok.
---
I went down THE top 3, simpleton.
---
B means Bitchez.
---
I mean, the exact same thing would happen in retail when you mentioned it as well.
---
Don't give these addons free advertisement... it's better if you ignore. Blizzard should take care of it.
---
OP, you think you want to defend BFA but you don't.
---
Same. Got in at launch, DC'ed 1 hrs later.. queen says 20000.. time to sleep I guess.
---
you don't buy the actual game anymore, just a subscription.
---
I know that. But surely the bandwidth they are getting is nothing like what Netflix etc. are getting. It's probably a small fraction. 
---
It seems like a game design issue and not a capacity/bandwidth issue
---
Medium PVP Server Venoxis 10k queue
---
Unless you're super hardcore, it isn't that big of a deal.
---
Honestly, I was one of the few who logged in to the world as soon as it was available. There must have been, what, 400/500 people all the Northshire Abbey? The layer lagged tremendously (which I actually quite enjoyed because it was quite funny) and it took me the best part of 30 mins to kill all the Kobold Vermin for fighting against the spawn of other players. Over the following few minutes after I turned the quest in, I could feel the game stabilising and the lag decreasing and the FPS increasing and started seeing different players. Evidently I had been moved to another layer, but the server must have opened more layers to alleviate the stress.
---
At that moment I knew, layering quite well and truly was working as fully intended, and it made my launch day experience 100% smooth and enjoyable.
---
Some don’t wanna min max.
---
Got 60% of a level.doing that one quest
---
I was in college the first time this game launched, and everyone was excited about it. It was the last day I saw half of my class
---
Yeah, we don't want that everywhere all the time. It's fun once in a while for everything to be crazy.
---
No changes
---
Lmao you bought WoD
---
'I listed the top 3 posts so even though you simply said 'a' top post that makes me right.' Shrivel already, you're boring and have been proven wrong repeatedly, this will be my last response to you as other people in this thread have provided discussion with valid reasoning
---
no
---
Just chatting = random girl with big boobs chatting an thousands of nerds jerking off
---
Taking your studies for granted and drinking/smoking weed is not something you should glorify. I suggest people enjoy the game, reasonably, while not sacrificing their health/responsibilities.
---
around 21-22 lvl
---
Low pop is fine. Its bigger the vanilla by far.
---
Oh I did not know that
---
I'm not even defending BFA, it had numerous flaws, what I DO want to do is point out what a toxic circlejerk this sub is
---
Yes opening and closing the client is a secret way to get ahead.. But please don’t share it with all of reddit classic forgot sake...!
---
I got DC'd ,when i went to WC
---
One time I hit him with concussive shot. I hope I'm that lucky this time
---
If you keep activating subs even for playing classic the subs will boost and BfA will be saved
---
God I hate launch weeks
---
some realms always get taken over by countries that have bad education and they don't speak English well. try to find a realm with western eu players they tend to speak English
---
Layering isn't the solution for Login-Queues. It's the solution to overcrowded starting-zones.
---
Was the same for me.  
---
Logged in about 20mins or so before launch, waited for that button to turn red and got in just fine and played just fine.
---
I don't think he has the coppers to pay for that many drinks :)
---
On the other end of the scale: I live in the middle of a major city in Norway, close to the city centre, and still can only get 30/10... I had triple the speed when I lived in the middle of nowhere ffs.
---
It'll probably be a few days, remember classic has only been out for 10,5 hours. a lot of people haven't even logged out yet. It'll cool down in time, just gotta be patient. Ofcourse this is pure speculation and I could be totally wrong.
---
Mograine is medium with thousands in queue so I'm pretty sure these are incorrect
---
population = total number of accounts active on the server
---
queue = high amount of accounts active at the same time.
---
Population usually expects a good percentage of players to not play at the same time. However, it's launch day, so the percentage is much higher.
---
An example with made up numbers:
---
A server is considered medium at 2000 people and full at 4000 people. It has a capacity of 1200 people playing at the time.
---
During normal operation, the server expects ~45% of active accounts to play simultanously at prime time, so ~900 people on the medium server, which means no queues and ~1800 on the full server, which means a big queue. However, during launch day 80% of active accounts play at the same time, so the medium server has 1600 people wanting to play, which is over capacity and thus also means queues for the medium server.
---
1k needles and Stonetalon, then hit up Hillsbrad, Arathi and do SM runs until 40ish, then Feralas/Tanaris.
---
I see no reason why not since we will be raiding Naxxramas at some point :-)
---
I think they changed it to reflect characters created/reserved before the game launched, and maybe they changed it back now to show current online players.
---
FYI it's not against ToS...
---
Login. Understand, that game is obsolete by 2k19. Logoff.
---
I fixed mine with hardware cursor script.  
---
/script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
Eh you don't *need* much. Just experience and enjoy the game :) Personally I can't play without Bartender as it allows you to customize your spell bars (number of rows and columns and where they are) as I like my spells in a grid of 5x4.
---
But if you don't mind them in their normal positions then you're pretty much fine
---
race doesn't matter except for like the 0.1% of the playerbase that are going to be trying to clear raids first before anyone else. Play what you like.
---
Anything else, simpleton?
---
population means how many people have a char on that server, nothing more
---
we have queues because the whole population tries to play at the same time, and that is not normal
---
I opened up the "Medium" Stalagg and got a 2k queue. So I think these numbers mean nothing.
---
You're not wrong but its great, my life needed more wholesome cringe. Love you mwah xxx
---
I feel bad that you feel like you have to shit on other people’s joy.
---
Can you get on Org walls/under Org in this version? Rocket boots xtreme won't be in until TBC, it's the only way I know of other than the old wall climbing glitches that have been patched out quite early on.
---
They can move too
---
Possible.... I just see all full bag slots and start to well up 😭
---
Yeah I agree. My mate managed to get in last night straight away whilst I was queuing. After an hour, he suddenly got DCd and my queue instantly went 3k to logging in
---
I personally had no problems today with it, but then again I’m on a lower pop server so idk
---
On the right upper corner you can select WoW retail or classic. The add ons are different.
---
I did not look into the items because it doesn't work on mobile. I read a lot of the comments tho and it seems you went proc heavy and some might be too good for other classes. What if you put class restrictions, or maybe go as far as making spell restrictions?
---
Next up legendaries which completely revamp a spell or meme spec? Turning dps to heal, tank to glass cannon?
---
Spot on
---
it's impossible for us to say. layering makes everything a lot more complicated.
---
Pretty sexist asumption that only man play the game
---
Btw to be sure to get a mob tag, bind your auto attack and spam tab + keybind
---
They thought they did, but they didn’t.
---
Yeah the population numbers are weird... 10 min queue i dont mind if its without random DCs every hour.
---
What quest gives the bow?

You can probably connect every house in Iceland with 1000 km glass fiber cable. London or even Berlin would need more than that.
---
Holy feck! Nice one.
---
THIS IS IT.  This is what the naysayers never understand.  When WoW was great, it was the community that made it what it was.  It was the relationships you developed.  That’s what was special.  That’s what was epic.  I’m so damn happy I can’t even sleep tonight and I’ve got work in 3 hours lol.
---
You want Zandalar Tribe RP-PvP then.
---
got a link to that tweet?
---
Can you go there as tauren ?
---
If I make an alt to DE loot/tailoring crap. What level does the alt need to be? How do I know which loot is disenchantable?

Cheers

Square Germans on vacation have the habit to reserve beach chairs by placing their towels on them, often even before breakfast.

&gt; Don’t be a stubborn adult
---
So you convinced all your friends to switch to the other server too? Grats
---
Yeah I’m trying to find the record of most viewers watching one catagory but I can’t find anything
---
This looks.....not fun.
---
You can sift through streams and reddit to try to figure it out. There’s no leaderboard for players to see.
---
I think he is not going to make it. Look at is face..
---
I don't dislike Retail, I play it quite a lot. It's an MMO without the RPG elements, it's a sort of confused mix between genres. It's an OK game but Classic has all the basic fundamental of *MMORPG.*
---
I bet a few more servers Will pop up making mograine a viable server. We are a group of danes giving it a shot
---
I decided to remain on Gandling, no idea about the faction ratio tho.
---
I would just skip, but that's cool everyone lined up
---
Last time i checked a lot of UK players wanted to play there.
---
Also most of the Dutch and Belgium players, plus some Swedish as well.
---
So yes, a lot of English speakers. :)
---
so wie es aussieht sind wir auch auf Venoxis - Hordenseite. Ihr auch? Könnt mir gerne euren Battletag per PN schicken (ich weiss meinen nicht auswendig ^^)
---
I missed the first hour or so. Swore to myself I'd clean and rearrange the living room before I played - got behind schedule.

I don't know. Let me get in the game and then I'll tell you about layering.
---
Right now all I can tell you about is the login.
---
I'm thinking about switching to a medium populated server. My only concern is that it might get depopulated to low if/when "tourists" players decide that they really don't want to play classic.
---
left: some people be like    
---
right: some other people be like
---
Id try to find the github and look at the readme
---
German tourists are notorious at places that have pools for waking up early, leaving a towel in each poolside chair they want to claim, and then leaving for hours. They expect the chair to still be towel-reserved when they come back.
---
Wait how does it work? Isnt "full" just indicating Que?
---
Because Mograine is medium but still que? Or are you saying its a lower player cap on medium servers than high?
---
When my server doesn't give me a two second delay between every action I'll get back to you.
---
well if you look in the chat you can see that the server was closing in 3 mins and 15 seconds... we were all there to get the rest bonus.
---
Just one disconnect and it's gg. Happened to me a few minutes ago.
---
Thank you.
---
A 48 hour stream? That is way too unhealthy. Not going to endorse that.
---
Mograine is mostly English I believe there’s a discord floating about somewhere on this sub
---
Pics of low now?
---
thanks!
---
In my opinion, he's honestly a really well-spoken streamer and is really passionate about the game - he clearly loves it and isn't afraid to show it.
---
So fucking great!
---
Stop harassing me
---

Nostalgia is a big factor and things have changed very much.
---
Well they release conter over time so probably there will be up and downs
---
And crazy
---
Queue in server to get in to queue in actual game. Nice!
---
There's a stereotype that when Germans go on holiday to hotel resorts, they wake up at around 6am to put their beach towels on the sun loungers/chairs in the sun. Then go back to bed until midday, when they want to sit in the sun. This is to basically reserve them in the early morning so nobody else can get on them.
---
Well herod was known to have some of the biggest ques. Not that any other server was much better but herod stayed at like 15k in qie for a long ass time
---
Ok
---
Germans tend to put their towels on everything at the beach to reserve the place for them. They sometimes stand up early to place their towels and then go back to sleep a bit or to eat breakfast at the hotel. It's not even a stereotype...
---
You can't have 1 million players on 1 server and expect them to fit into 1 layer by phase 2, Blizzard needs queues to force people to roll onto other servers.
---
Oh wow this discussion for the 100th time.

Listen. People like things you don’t like. Welcome to the world.

My username is a reference to this.

Although they both bare the title of WoW they are hardly the same game. Retail WoW has done a lot to modernise the game, much to some people’s distaste. Every expansion has had its ups and down but this expansion currently has a bad rep which is why classic hype is even bigger. I personally really enjoy retail but there is a lot to be improved. That said, classic has lots of issues in its own right that are accepted as part of the game. But their is something special about classic that makes the game feel alive. The sense of progression and scale of the world captures perfectly what an MMO should be. They didn’t release it before because blizzard didn’t think it was a good model/were ignorant to pretending people didn’t want it.
---
As others said, the existing game and the classic are quite different games at this point, and they also can't just update the existing game with classic features because the playerbase of the current WoW BFA might be as unwilling to play WoW Classic as Classic fans are to BFA.
---
0 bags for me and I'm level 13 hahaha bug fat F
---
If you log out you won't see any of them again anyway because you'll be in queue until they hit 60
---
Me, my friends and colleagues all created characters on Gehennas because of the big Swedish community but now I'm thinking of playing on Mograine instead. It would totally suck if this server is filled with non English speakers.
---
And the wisdom says: reroll
---
I've been abusing it to hop to friends layers if mobs aren't spawning.
---
I know, it is a little bit addicting to stay though. Inner voice tell yourself next time has to be your group.
---
No queues on Zandalar Tribe EU on launch or now.
---
Caffeine is a helluva drug.
---
Where can I find this?
---
Moonglade? As a Tauren Druid?
---
You checked the config in user interface / add-ons ?
---
VR-hardware as is still too cumbersome. Base-stations, helmet-like goggles, cables everyfuckingwhere, pylons for tracking...
---
Yea, that's gonna be a big nope from me.
---
But I'm sure the technology will get there, eventually. So far, though, the games and software just isn't all that great.
---
Sweet I know its really classic but I just want to play human since its relatable what rep grinds are there?
---
\[The trolls and orcs are doing it also.... Except zlazane that was a lottery.\]([https://i.imgur.com/SHmH16I.jpg?1](https://i.imgur.com/SHmH16I.jpg?1))
---
It looks distinctly British...
---
Her Majesty would be proud.
---
There was no "standard" stat distribution back then, there were some really odd items. You'd want to refer to tier lists because in many cases they're far from obvious if you don't know the in depth mechanics.
---
Seriously people. The quest logs more often than not make it very clear where you have to go and where to find stuff.
---
Old Blanchy. Slow and steady wins the race. Grab your blanket and a free bag of feed and enjoy the game 😊
---
i mean if you’re in the U.S i don’t know about tax payers...
---
To play ancient content too
---
As soon as Blizzard stops being fucking incompetent. Offer free realm transfers to less populated realms. I don't understand who was in charge of releasing servers, but holy fuck did they do a horrible job. They should honestly be fired.
---
I played 3h on Mograine last night, and /1 was English only.
---
Made some English speaking friends as well. :)
---
Replying to a comment you made to me is *not* harassment, else you would be completely guilty of that already (moreso as your posts have been blatant lies about me). 
---
To call me a harasser for responding to the lies you're telling about me is an actual form of harassment AKA gaslighting. Stop.
---
I went from 3k to 1k and my friend on whitemane got dc and sent to 3.4k
---
isnt this a bit pointless?  might as well kill a few mobs and forget the quest
---
I hear ya
---
what is this a RP/pve server or something?
---
This is the most irresponsible thing I've ever heard. I know people during vanilla to drop out/get kicked out of university by doing exactly what you are suggesting.
---
My advice, enjoy the game but be responsible. I doubt very much the flaunting of success is measured that high by certain people. Success is subjective, to some it's a tiny house with a backyard, to others it's their own private jet.
---
Instantkill? that name wont last a month...
---
I told you once to stop harassing me, this is your final warning.
---
panic
---
That's super lame.  You're throwing away playing with your friends for a technical issue that'll be gone within days/maybe a week.
---
Join Gandling then! Haha. Feels kinda busy and there's never a queue. Hope it doesn't die.
---
Just like old times.
---
no! How can i change there the position of the addon in game? Do I have to open it with word ?
---
No, it was part of his guide - crushing and waiting for servers to come back. Looks like really solid guide to me.
---
This would be a dope video, just an hour of people all over the world saying "I do" in response to that smug ass clip
---
&gt; You think the original was it's best version? Lol
---
Each has their flaws. IMO WOTLK is all around the best but towards the end it went full casual.
---
Other servers might get better. Can’t say the same on faerlina cause ppl wanna play with all the streamers lol
---
Anyone playing on noggerfogger? whats your thoughts on that server?
---
Its basically an 8 hour queue to get into a 6 hour queue.
---
Day 1 is never a good indication of success. I want to know how many players still play after their first month. That should tell you something about success.
---
One of them...
---
Makes sense given some servers were medium pop with queue times
---
All the smart boys picked their sub up the day earlier ;)
---
Snooze ya loose brah
---
\- *You've turned them against me! YOU'RE NOT TAKING THEM FROM ME!*
---
\- *Your dopamine and lust for azerite power has already done that...*

No support for streamers.
---
No respect for speed runs.
---
Enjoy the Classic experience.
---
looks like mmo is back on the menu
---
you got that far? all i get is you have been disconnected from the chat server
---
It's a game. You're not actually being spat on.
---
Interesting approach. I played rogue in vanilla and I'm planning on playing one again in classic. But priest which I've never played before would be also n1.
---
Hard choice bc of the time commitment
---
its Titan panal.
---
I know its /CAD but there I cant move any bars
---
I love this
---
Pirate screems ye?
---
Your academic professors didn't get a minor in emotions?

How u so lucky with bags?

mad mad mad mad mad
---
Layering should have nothing to do with if he appears in your friend’s list.
---
And you have an excuse to show your setup hehe
---
Ha! Funny you say that because I rolled a shaman. Never played one last lvl 20
---
Wait until they turn layering off lol
---
Sorry to hear. Sometimes you don't see the consequences  of these things, especially if being sleep deprived and consuming too much energy/cafeine. Hope you are doing better now!
---
At least I now have a lvl 3 on all Aussie servers
---
They decided to roll on the 3. biggest eu realm, no way there isn't gonna be a permanent queue no matter if release week or not. Most of them usually drop wow after a week anyway and i have friends on another realm that's actually gonna let me play without a 17 hours queue. Ofc it sucks, but I would rather just play the game.
---
If you're not first, you're last!
---
People just don't like how cocky and opinionated he is - but he's a character, that's the point
---
Wrong, replying to a response is not harrassment, lest you would be twice as guilty. 
---
Posting baseless untruths about someone, then claiming victimhood to rob them of the right to defend themself truthfully *is* harassment, gaslighting and actually bullying. Why does it feel like you're doing this to me deliberately. If this is the goal, just close the thread and Stop.
---
Hahahaha this one is very good!
---
Taking a picture of your computer monitor with your smartphone in 2k19 hype

Got in 20 mins after this comment. Played for hour and half, no ragrets
---
Those damned bakers..
---
Oof. I'm curious how long I'm gonna need to wait... and I need to work 3 hours gosh the waitig drives me nuts
---
I seemingly fought against 5k other players for boars.  I don't buy that Layering was in effect at launch.
---
&gt;no but yes
---
I got dc’d twice and was able to get back on right away on bigglesworth
---
Yeah lots of English on Mograine
---
best 20s spent
---
You were warned twice and have now been blocked using RES. Any further attempts to communicate with me will be reported to the FBI.
---
Frost is considered best for leveling. WoWHead Classic has a good section for leveling a mage, including specs.
---
i skipped sarkoth, the medallion, zazalaine (or whatever) etc. just got as much exp as i could and bounced. razorhill onwards is much better.
---
Is it mostly English speaking?

Equipable items of green or better quality can be disenchanted (with maybe a few exceptions). I believe level 35 is what you need to be to max out professions.
---
Wait, have you tried to troll? In that case that wasn't great attempt.
---
I believe alts need to be 35 to max out professions
---
I was 2k away ("20min") from getting in and my power went out, fml.
---
No, and you don't get to choose where you go but OP is a dickhead regardless.
---
Just saw this absolute magic this is Hodors heaven and he looks so happy.
---
Spent all my silver on bags as soon as I could, totally worth.
---
Gotta love those quests to pick up 4 items that take up one slot each when you only got 16 (half of which are filled with herbs).
---
I feel this spiritually - I queued for close to 10 hours and then got DC'd before I could log in.  
---
Now I'm at 6k in the queue.
---

---
Stardew Valley... yeah
---
What's crazy is that it seems that every server had those lines. I'm so proud of this community
---
It's so wholesome.
---
Yeah I got in just after your comment
---
With these many people trying to play it's basically a unintentonal DDOS-attack on the blizzard servers.

You’re gonna cry after this? Lol

It took you 20 minutes to realize, I'd say you got got.

Really? For me once I logged into a server I was fine on re-log as long as I didn't log off b net
---
Wotlk is dumpster level
---
Ugh he really is the epitome of ugly
---
Same. Seems good here
---
what do you think would be a good solution? Having more servers right from the start?
---
WIthout overfilled servers now, servers will be dead in a few months/weeks when half the people going for the hype decide to leave wow/go back to retail
---
I remember doing this on my first character as well! Take care of your friend!
---
I said AFK cheaters, not bots. Different things.
---
It's definitely broken 1m for certain esports events. Idk exact number tho but it's not like this is blowing it out of the water.
---
Saw this last night queuing for Sarkoth as an orc, someone added me to a 5 man group and I got my item while all these numpties queued for fresh air.
---
And then restart at vanilla again after wotlk!
---
Praying to the almighty gods that when I'm out of work in 5 hours that the servers won't have huge que times anymore like last night
---
Dynamic respawns I'd guess, makes crowded areas easier to handle because you can pick a cluster of mobs and just wait for them to respawn instead of racing around trying to tag
---
I think he's really happy that Classic paid off, I don't understand why this subreddit assumes he haven't changes his mind since he said it :/
---
Ahh yes, wait for the tourist to be gone and then for there to be 10 dead realms. Blizzard released too few realms, and then released way too many realms. They need to come out and say what they plan to do when these realms die.
---
Or just do like they use to and offer server transfer for free from grossly overpopulated realms..or nowadays just pay a streamer to be on the new server so people will play it if they add more
---
I did the same thing back in the day. . .
---
Been playing on Pagle since 10pm. Queue was about 3 hours, not DC'ed or crashed once.
---
I've heard Elywnn Forest is a hell hole though. Mass exodus of humans everywhere.
---
Lol blizzard gives us the game of our wildest dreams  and y'all screech about a problem they said they'll fix.
---
Literally go read the blue posts and watch the classiccast episode with the devs in it and calm down.
---
Count me in!
---
Whatever RES is, I hope it works. To any moderator when they read this, please look close to see exactly what this user is doing. 
---
It felt deliberate and actually uncomfortable to be lied about, then called a perpetrator for simply defending ones self. Some could call it predatory behaviour, yet I feel like this was a deliberate social tactic designed to have this outcome.
---
Im going on a New low pop pvp server that just launched...
---
Queued for 7 hours, played and made level two. Server crashed. 
---
Back in queue.
---
Hopefully this settles but fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
---
Westfall dwaven zone had the same thing. Very orderly and nice
---
Great thank you
---
Nah it's just that the women are the ones going to get paranoid about it.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/journeywow
---
Highest level atm.
---
I respect that. Was just trying to give him some love, me and him met randomly on a private server , northdale to be exact and quested together for 9+hours the first time we met . Just wanted to get the eyes of big streamers and too the streamers who were more like the players when we first started. But again I respect where you stand.
---
No waaaaay! A there we're que times? For classic WoW launch? Woooow! I'm so glad I read Reddit and was informed about this phenomenon. I feel for you guys /s
---
No, you can not transfer to full realms.
---
tried all tips so far. not working :(
---
Trolling should burn asap, idealy during reading. It will cause downvotes and fun. When it takes 20min of understanding that it is trolling - that is wasted attemp. You should have more practice. With queues to wow you'll have some time to do that.
---
Those weird niche builds don’t really work until 60. You’re better just going deep into one.
---
On Atiesh they actually turned a clickfest in Elwynn into a line midway through.  Was surprised it worked as the entire launch zerg was there.
---
No idea, but it's pretty bad. I've been in queue for 2 hours now and I've gotten from place 3500 to 2500 :(
---
Blizzard: released 2 realms
---
People: WTF ONLY 2 REALMS, GAME IS DEAD
---
Blizzard: releases 2 more realms
---
People: WTF SERVERS GONNA BE DEAD IN 3 HOURS
---
you just can’t win against internet cowboys
---
We don't really know that yet until we see player longevity. A lot of people are expecting much more out of the game than they're initially going to get. The grind has always been the wall, and it can be *slow* depending on what class you're rolling.
---
Tried that,   
---
The other character can login, but it doesn't fix the issue for my main.
---
Thanks
---
I was on firemaw eu and undead zone wasn't too full and i did most quests very quick. However mates in orc and troll zones had wait in line for quests
---
&gt;60
---
Rather hopeful that our generation can retire lol
---
I went in there with my friend, 30 people camping, asked if anyone wanted an invite. My friend tagged the first spawn and we got the hell out of there! Nobody was fast enough to accept the invite :D
---
Ooh man this really sucks
---
If you can even get on the server you picked
---
Praise Geraldo.
---
Here’s the deal. If no one changes servers then the queues remain at 10-20k. Ppl actually have to change servers whether they like it or not. It’s all a matter of who caves first.
---
Yeah, looked like it worked a treat. Props for getting straight back to stream instead of trying to wake up a bit. Looked so disorientated.
---
BfA is a really bad game, it deserves every bit of moaning it can get.
---
We should have more of these threads where we can share our feelings about how awful retail is and has been for a long long time, maybe then the devs will understand.
---
That has to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard
---
we dont know that, but i doubt they will allow you to transfer from  "low" to "high"
---
Update: started in position 23500. Got in after 8 hours. I just napped and set an alarm.
---
Well, waiting in line is effectively a que time
---
(Insert reddit copper) thanks!
---
ah thanks! Does it maybe unlock when you have a config open? Some mods do that too
---
Nope, you fucked up.
---
Mograine is your best choice. 
---
According to the Reddit poll it has the highest percentage of English speaking players, and almost a 50:50 faction balance.
---
I played there last night and /1 was English only.

Because you que up... Over time... No? :(
---
So people have been complaining that we need more servers but now people are complaining that they will be empty?
---
Wrong.
---
Apparently all of the people on my server missed the queue for bosses and quests note. We saw a lot of people piled on top of one quest target, waiting for him to spawn or random player sprinting up and grabbing it right from under your nose. Welcome to classic.
---
WHAT. can you give me an update? I think I'm also going to switch to venoxis. How bad is it there?
---
Maybe if you knew how to printscreen you could get in and play, level 18 on arugal.
---
Nothing but cash money.

¿Qué pasó, Aandkh? ¿No vas a contestar?

You schedule your paid time off for this week like a pro employed gamer.

None at zandalar tribe, rppvp eu. It was absolutely jam packed though. Very laggy, but i guess playable. This morning i logged in to see if it was better and it was. Still packed, but only minor lag. I guess it Will be fine from tomorrow on.
---
I was just thinking about this and looking for it. Thank you !
---
Are you going to pretend your comment was about lines near a boss spawn?
---
I thought it was cool that people were so respectful but fuck me right
---
This is true! #remulos
---
If you mail yourself you can put Name-Realm and it will tell you, you cant mail yourself.

damn, the biggest english speaking server has half the que of the biggest german one. feelsbadman

Alliance. Stay loyal to your faction
---
Ye it takes a screenshot. I took this pic on my phone last night to send it to my friend on whatsapp.
---
Haha. It was a line like this for me to. Just ran to the front and tagged it. People were pissed
---
Possibly related: does the classic client have that integrated voice chat ? If so, maybe if this is active then it supersedes discord's sound system hoots
---
Try running it in compatibility mode for Windows 8. Fixed a number of issues for people from audio to graphics

Due to the delicate nature of Iceland and how the highlands work the entire fiber network needs to run around the coast next to roads. Iceland is quite big compared to what you see on a map for example. However in the smaller towns you definitely dont need a lot of it. Getting it into the towns is the tricky and expensive part.
---
Leveling in a brothel?
---
This screenshot is really similar what i saw right after whitemane crashed.
---
First kill I got a 6 slot. Currently level 8 and none since.
---
I'm at work so I can't check it right now, sorry.
---
You traitorous Alliance dogs have no loyalty.
---
just because you restart somewhere else doesn't mean your time was wasted :)
---
Horde, be with your friends
---
&gt;It’s 5 am in the fucking morning 
---
It's because launch was not even 12 hours ago. These numbers will calm down.
---
Mograine. Have been able to play from launch time except maybe 2 hours of 'world server down' and server shutdown.
---
Lol I got 2 super fast also my companions in discord were salty
---
We're lucky the game even fucking exists dude. This is the first game to do this on such a massive scale, shit will be fine because they've put so much money in and already gotten so much out that it would be suicide to stop. And as for the current state of the game, not sure what you mean cause I played 8 hours uninterrupted other than a small crash 10 minutes after launch
---
I'm not saying everything is perfect, im saying people need to chill cause shits gonna be fine
---
30min 1-6, then 45 min just for the medallion quest... gg
---
Yeah, it said 50 minutes when i logged in an hour ago. It says 67 minutes right now. So its not the best in estimating time..
---
Yes, the game uses the new battle.net UI. It actually looks quite out of place with all the archaic menus.
---
Its not as big, only the hype. In terms of actual numbers its very big, huge, but not the biggest deal in two decades. Top 5 prolly
---
Mograine cause I got the names Momon and Momonga from Overlord !
---
Yes, that's the problem - it's not working.
---
Is it possible to stay logged in for a longer period (if I wanna have lunch or go to the gym or smt) and then get right back to it?
---
also can't join the discord, says link is invalid for me
---
Mounts take up a slot in your bag in classic.
---
No they take up a bag slot
---
Exactly. There are people making free bags as long as you provide the mats
---
Should have queued and then gone to work.
---
As an $ATVI stockholder this is most important issue to solve right now 😂
---
I've been stuck at around 3hrs of waiting time for an hour now. I could probably put myself into queue right now and get in by the time I get home in 6 hours. lol
---
If you can switch, switch.
---
THIS! i am wondering and little bit skeptical too, but i do not think that Blizzard would let realms die and i think there are still more people to come in the evening after work etc.  so lets hope they dont want to be in queues and go to our low pops
---
Thanks dude y'all are sweet.
---
Welcome to home
---
Unless you have a reason to stay on Firemaw, like your guild or the Danish community playing there, then you should abandon ship. There will be shit queues for months, and then once Blizzard finally opens paid transfers it'll completely wreck the community.
---
It's a complete repeat of vanilla.
---
Same here, Im in a high server. I will wait a couple of weeks and then decide. Meanwhile lvling an alter in ZT with the opposite faction.
---
But they will be laughing when you are unable to do any endgame content :\^)
---
I can see it calming down a little for the other high pop servers but faerlina will prob maintain its queues because ppl will wanna play with streamers
---
Nope, I had this as well. This is an easy fix! In Discord, go to User Settings -&gt; Voice and Video -&gt; Advanced, and DISABLE "Enable Quality of Service High Packet Priority". It worked for me. Good Luck!
---
Well, you can put something on your space bar to jump constantly. However, that can get you banned.
---
I think last night proved my point.
---
Real casuals know not to play at launch but wait for a week or so.
---
Yojamba now has a 40 minute que time.
---
That escalated quickly
---
Okey Garrosh
---
Some of them dont in a few months?
---
Wait, there was voice chat in vanila? Where is full scale rebelion with #nochanges?
---
This kid has an an awful attitude and is not enjoyable to watch
---
Retard
---
That's for being capable of disenchanting.
---
There is no mount tab. Your mounts are kept in the bag, it's an item you have to store.
---
Paladins and warlocks have specific class mounts which are spells.
---
Ah yeah that’s for in game, I can’t go to char select and kind of stay there I guess? Just cuz others could last night I read but am not sure about it. If not then no worries, I’ll log out and rejoin the queue ^_^
---
To counter the “he did nothing wrong”.  I found him to be short tempered and obnoxious.
---
To clarify;  short tempered because he snapped at people for being told off about having unfair buffs when dueling.
---
Obnoxious because he harped on minute details that were not relevant to the Classic experience.
---
Source:  tuning into a stream of his during the demo.
---
Additionally, I did not like his immature attitude when I saw another video featuring him being ganked.  Acted like hot crap when he wins with a post of 5+ and complained when destroyed beyond his posse’s defenses.
---
Overall, I don’t like what I’ve seen.  Take the good and the bad, make your own decision.  But I shan’t waste more time on the mouth breather.
---
It’s funny cause there was a line, I walked straight past to the mob spawn, spammed auto attack and got it first try.
---
The indicator likely changed function specifically for the character creation phase.
---
Can u play bfa while in the queue for classic?
---
Once the hype is over. 1-2 weeks maybe. I bet a lot of people will quit around level 30, because that's when you really start to notice the grind.
---
I‘ve never played WoW and I‘d like to get into this game now. Besides the subscription, do I have to buy any of the expansions or something like that?
---
&gt; I've been saying for months that I wouldn't allow any of this type of stuff to affect my decision, but with the launch date looming I find myself doing more and more research into which specs are viable for endgame PvE content.
---
I played back in vanilla and as a 12/13 year old this stuff didn't bother me in the slightest, everyone just played what they wanted to play.
---
My main issue is that all of my friends are now playing horde, so I've had to follow despite being an Alli player to my core. It feels incredibly wrong to be playing horde and I don't really want to play any of the available class/race combos.
---
I'm looking into playing Sham because my main back in vanilla was a paladin and I've always had a thing for healer/support types
---
Careful, I think you are confusing the term viable. It doesn't apply to dps as much as it does with tanks.
---
Why can nobody spell queue?
---
The entire EU went down for about 15 minutes earlier, I remember some people were livid because they'd spent 4/5 hours in login queues to be hit with "server shit down 15:00" before they even hit level 2.
---
I wasn't one of those people but I felt their pain.
---
Actually it was perfectly fine. A bit laggy for the first quest, but right after that I had no issues whatsoever
---
You'd have to find a way to press some button (like jump) repeatedly. This is technically illegal, so you'll have to figure that out for yourself.
---
Did that run right at 3pm PDT yesterday on my girlfriend's nightelf. Hell of a trip down memory corpse run lame lol
---
Ran to undead starting area as an orc with a friend, undead players were so rude calling us filthy smelly orcs.
---
I got to level 6 last night and completed all the starting area quests. Got like 4 hours sleep :^) Glad to get those out of the way so when I play after work today I won't have to deal with the competition.
---
I was streaming for some friends and the music was playing in the background
---
Anyone rolling Razorgore EU? Im worried it may not have a sustainable population.
---
explain EU then
---
you will need a bag slot for every mount you buy,
---
so think carfully witch one you want
---
Is there maintenance tonight? Are servers going down in a few hrs?
---
r/thathappened
---
You have more faith in humanity than I do, friend. SM cath is about where I'd recommend most new players to start using it.
---
A. Why would you want to?
---
B. You’ll get pushed Down lower In que cause your “afk” because you must watch the timer
---
Dont ever wonder why...when u get booted out of a group.
---
Blacklists are a thing here and its quite easy to add with the use of addons.
---
Have fun :3
---
Hard to say. If it looks interesting to you and you want to give it a go, then by all means :) Classic is probably the best time to be new to WoW, because it is much more focused on the leveling and community aspect than the newer versions. Also, everyone else literally just started out, so the world is filled with players of all ages :)
---
I am a huge wow nerd but never actually played classic. I am on the fence of whether I should join the hype train? Will I be too late in a week or so to start out fresh?
---
We don’t know really what they’re going to do with server transfers. The queue times won’t be this bad for long. You could either wait and catch up or just deal with the queues right now.
---
&gt; In dungeon you might get invited if people can’t find anyone else. Forget about doing raids with it though. I’d recommend going holy instead.
---
For raids you will need to find an experienced guild.
---
Don’t walk away from it unless you’re ok with getting DC. Was going through the key bond settings for a few minutes and got DC after8 Hour que time.
---
No, just the subscription.
---
CUT MY WIFE INTO PIECES
---
They just show where quests are on the map.
---
There are no transfers right now. The devs said they may introduce them later but I'd guess it will probably be many months if not over a year. Keep in mind that medium pop in 2019 is as big as full in 2006.
---
Me too, but only due to a far in advance booked 3 weeks trip. I hope to come back to smooth servers and queues managed
---
You'd have to use elvui but it changes the ui completly
---
Just standard sub
---
I'd like to know this to. Find it really interesting
---
Feels like 2
---
just active subscription or gametime.  You may need to buy "base wow" though, which is Vanilla through MoP at least.
---
Epic
---
Go majority frost, it's easily the best way to level a mage.
---
you can circumvent this by leap frogging threat, it's not for the average day player but no the end of the world.
---
You can go play on bojimba but enjoy a dead server in a month :/
---
Just classic download should be fine. 
---
All you need is an active subscription.
---
Yup, 7am PDT I think
---
Still 400k
---
My best guess is that low medium high and full represent the length of queues, not actual server Population. Mograine was full within 2 hours of coming online.
---
Kromkush is the goat
---
If you JUST got in the queue now, you probably wont make it in before downtime tonight at 12am AEST.
---
Dumb question is there a setting to have all the bags open at once?
---
Not at all. There will be tons of people playing at all levels. But why wait?!
---
seems legit
---
i think i give it a try - work less, play more :)
---
Transfers aren't a thing yet and even when they are, you most likely won't be able to transfer onto a full realm.
---
You can definitely create a new character on a full realm, though.
---
7am PDT happens when this comment is 4 hours and 37 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/PwOAaRLL0
---
Yeah I'm also worrying about the queue...
---
Classic isn’t like retail. It’s gonna take a really long time to leave for most people and you won’t fall behind just because you’re a week late. You could wait months and be fine.
---
1. Just Classic
---
2. No, just need game time
---
I'm currently 7339 with "27" mins
---
Going full frost (or fire) means you can focus on only leveling 1 spell too, so saving gold for your mount
---
I think I've seen a 20 Mage on Twitch but I assume someone might be higher
---
i will log in remotly form work at about 12:00, so i will be logged in when i come home at about 15:30 \^\^
---
A priest gave me green mail as well (warr) just need to form lines for those slow spawn mobs
---
How is golemagg And gehennas doing regarding queue?
---
&gt; so think carfully witch one you want
---
[Hmm](https://media1.tenor.com/images/8cbd7b4d630be38f62a50560622fac75/tenor.gif?itemid=13539687)
---
Content you love to see; this.
---
&gt; No. A lot of special snowflakes will tell you that they make good tanks, but they are exactly that: special snowflakes who just HAVE to be that guy who tries to make it work and tell everyone he does it. Warriors are better than you. Feral druids are better than you. If it was TBC, sure, why not? But it's not. So no.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Avantages over priests:
---
&gt; You bring blessings. Those are pretty damn important.
---
&gt; You have access to plate and shield = sturdier.
---
&gt; Wipe prevention with DI (if someone else can rez).
---
&gt; IMHO, a pally who micro-manages his heals ranks correctly can heal longer than a priest can. They, however, have more versatility when it comes to heals.
---
&gt; Lots of tools to make you very annoying in PVP.
---
Has anyone ever said paladins make better tanks? most people just try it as a form of challenge/achievement.
---
Really glad I won't be able to play until Sat. This looks like a complete shit show even if people are waiting in line.
---
Populated realms have much healthier economies, and pve / pvp scenes, especially in the endgame. Dead realm now = dead realm later, much harder to find people to play with.
---
Dude, we need sleep. 
---
A lot of people like myself played for hours last night but only hit level 6 because of congestion on lower level content. I waited 40 minutes to complete Salvaged Goods in the undead starting area. I had to go to sleep at 3.00am because work started at 8.00am. I'm here at work now counting the seconds until I can get back online. 
---
I can't conceive how you got to level 12 last night, and I think you found it lonely because you're way ahead of most people now. 
---
Drop off won't be as bad as you think.
---
I'm trying to do it now, I keep getting killed by ??Level bluegill raiders
---
How long does this quest take? I remember at WotLK launch there was a quest where you had to talk to an npc that triggers a very long sequence (the one where saurfang shows up to save the day), that's like 3 minutes the next person has to wait for their turn.
---
You can't actually, it has a few thousand in a queue. Pretty far from dead.
---
I switched to medium pop. my train of thought was... High/full pop will have a higher percentage of tourists and therefore will drop more quickly where as medium are all the old guard that don't have time to sit in a 7 hour queue to play for 4 hours
---
Alright, thanks for the quick answer!
---
I should’ve done it sooner.  My GF was 30 silver up on me because of it.  Not making that mistake again!
---
Is there any english EU server that is playable right now? Sitting in queue for 5 hrs on firemaw and still place 6000... Considering switching to a lower pop server, send help!
---
The game existed just fine on private servers. Blizzard needs to be transparent with us and acknowledge they fucked up. They need to say tomorrow what the plan is with all these overflow servers once the population dies off. They need to find a way to get people off of whitemane, Herod, and stalag(and their EU equivalents), and on to the ‘overflow realms’. They also need to be straight up if server transfers will be available or not(from low to high as well). It has potential, but right now they’re doing everything wrong.
---
Thanks dude!
---
Long much longer on them sausages?
---
I actually thought it was pretty cool being in the starting area with like 100+ other ppl lol. This is my first exp on WoW. I didn’t have any major issues either
---
Level 6 was exactly my limit too! Seems to be the number for us working folk xD
---
Really can't recommend it, trying to play on a realm like that is impossible unless you play tauren.
---
Shift-B ;)
---
You made a line on Horde? What is this sacrilege.
---
Friends, guilds, etc. Though I am beginning to consider switching despite those, at least for now.
---
Also in classic the skill to ride is cheap but the mount itself is expensive, so be sure you buy the right one.
---
On the forums...morons surprised that overpopulated servers have long queues.... exactly what blizzard has said the past couple weeks
---
Pfft, my server is atm 12000 in queue and 336 minutes.
---
On a vacation where I don't have a pc. Will be home Monday so I have till then to decide. I have another game I am tryharding in, but classic seems like a very good game to stream, even though everyone and their dog will be doing so.
---
You probably hit the moment when they were restarting servers.
---
Dead game !
---
I guess that begs the question... Why are there's still queues if they are doing this (what seems like pretty scalable) layering thing?
---
EZClap thank you :D
---
I just saw a 21 mage when you do /who and that was just my server and faction
---
Yes but with only 275 responses.
---
Are the queues still insanely long? Or are they better than yesterday?
---
Priest scar?
---
I think I remembered it feeling out of place by comparison, but then I remembered it used to be owned by humans so it made sense. Doesn't it have the same track as Goldshire?
---
Completely new to wow.
---
Can i respec my stats like agility etc later in the game? i know that i can respec talents.
---
I believe there’s an add on you can get that tells you what the current highest level is. Not sure what it’s called tho, last I heard highest level was 21
---
Jobs, lives, etc.
---
There's an interface option to open loot at your mouse position.
---
To move the char frames you need an addon
---

---
Razoregore, got to lvl 13 in 9 hours
---
Right, because the only pve server in Australia is gonna have zero raiding playersm
---
This happen in many quests.
---
I'm my 20 years of online gaming I've never seen something like that.
---
More civilized then irl
---
I am conflicted by the post above and below.
---
I came here for a DC and I am disappointed
---
Lawful evil
---
Casuals with new phobias
---
Pretty sure if you hit shift+b... Not entirely sure and I'm currently in Q
---
Only time will tell on that. I tend to agree with OP in his previous statement, they are feeling the player base out to see where they really need to go in the next xpac to hopefully get their subscriber base back up to where they can lean on WoW as the cash machine it once was.
---
Haha yeah, possible I know. Just wondering if it will increase my leveling time by 1000% because then it's not really worth it hehe.
---
That's why I'm waiting till next Monday for tourists to stop playing, friendly tip if you can contain yourself do the same
---
Play w/e u like
---
In Legion pvp was nothing like in vanilla
---
A lot of tension coupled with satisfaction and at the same time frustration is to be expected in PvP servers. I love pvp server

Killing the Rattlecages in Deathknell

Almost 4 hours and haven’t gotten in yet
---
Obvious troll guy... u\_u
---
Isn't it an email address?
---
But isnt there server maintance at 16:00? Or only for US servers?
---
I'm not sure if they kept that change in or not.
---
Same, I logged on, waited in queue for 10 hours, played for about 5 minutes before getting DCed, and put back into another 10k queue. Feelsgoodman. Really grateful to Blizz for making sure 2019 Classic felt just like 2006 Vanilla launch. :) One of the best companies around.
---
Get him reported my lad
---
You can log in now on almost any server with a pretty low que. It's just peak times that are really bad
---
Warlock tortle.
---
Also druid is viable endgame tanking, if you know how to.   
---
Check out  "Skarmtank" on twich or yt :) he will do the same
---
guess you can tank every boss in the game except 2-3 bosses
---
I disagree with the post because everyone is in the world levelling not in stormwind, but there's literally 10k+ quieues on EU at the moment, everyone is definitely not in bed lol.
---
My guess would be that the xfers are FROM the big servers with queues onto servers that are "empty" and have no queue, not the othe way around that you described.
---
Please let this level of civility spread across all realms!
---
Warlock tortle?
---
Alright dude, thanks a lot!
---
So i'll play either mirage raceway or pyrewood village!
---
I can only play during peak times sadly
---
Sorry. I misconstrued the comments. 
---
It was a knee-jerk reaction to people going “will this spec get me through Naxx?” and I’m like “Bitch, get through UBRS first”
---
Apologies
---
Roll Horde for not having to play Alliance. Easy choice
---
"Fake newbie" here probably means people who pretend to be new and ask questions that new people usually ask (or asked back then).
---
[Flamelash EU at launch](https://i.imgur.com/yZfP0OJ.jpg). There were even more people in the quest area, by that point I was too busy trying to tag mobs to screenshot though!
---
You wouldnt have been playing anyways my dude so its ok. i got up early 6am here in germany and have been in queue for the last 4h. and probably will be for most of the day since you get disconnected and sent back to queue end for whatever reason
---
Why? I find parser from trade chat to make list of all groups where you still HAVE TO pm leader and walk to instance good.
---
Problem is auto matchmaking and teleportation, not list of all leaders/groups looking for more.
---
I almost had the dedication to join Herod’s long q of 20k, but I ended up rerolling on the new server Kromcrush. No regrets. Hopefully they open up xfers in different phases when BGs become a thing and a lot of servers die down.

How do I turn of the error message sound spam ?

”But fucking casuals man, you should be hardcore like me. Man the fuck up. Go back to retail scrub”
---
Then they sit on your bed and watch.
---
YES CAN I HELP YOU, MOTHER?
---
I wasn't even mad at the queues, mainly because I had to work anyways.
---
Imagine linking something to prove your point when it actually proves the opposite, and then claiming that what you linked does disprove your point.  The mental gymnastics are hilarious,
---
Maybe they should of had way more servers but i guess blizzard knows more than the community still right?
---
Does taking 25 min power naps with a timer set to wake me up and check my position in the queue count?
---
I managed to get 2 hours in lat night and 1.5 hours this morning before work
---
How can they detect RDP for opening the game, or even playing?
---
He never tought he was "safe" tho
---
Nope... I am going camping for a week tomorrow.  Won't be able to play. No dramas.
---
Should probably NSFW this
---
I loved it too watch. I think he was realy close on crying
---
Why hate speedrunners? Some people prefer vanilla end game. I don't blame them.
---
I've always played mainly horde. I know those quests like the back of my hand. I want to main horde again, but honestly that reason alone is making me want to play alliance. To experience the unfamiliarity!
---
You can get to undead zone in ~10min or so.
---
I've done it on my troll at launch too.
---
Just... run.
---
Most of the time this charge works btw
---
Yea..he is going to get fucked up if he stays awake that long staring at a screen
---
Oh sweet Summer Child. 
---
Check the AH
---
Considering there are 7 hour queues you might want to sign up now. :p
---
Who's the guy singing?
---
Sorry, I forgot to mention I haven't played since end of wrath. We had usernames back then and my current battlenet email doesn't work.
---
Damnit, i'm tasteless
---
Skeram has wandering groups tagging quest mobs, but at least people are grouping up.
---
How is this even actually a question lol
---
This, couldn't watch him more than a few minutes before realizing his attitude was awful
---
To be fair, launch day isn't really a good metric to counter that argument. A healthy, sizable community in a few months time will.
---
It was around 371k, I was watching his stream while playing myself so I might be off by some tho.
---
Yeah true, I just think it would be fun to have a whole Dutch server :)
---
I never really thought of it like this but you're right. We went from glorious Halo 3, crazy interactions on Xbox 360 in lobby chat to free to play games where people spend loads of money on cosmetics to look cool EG/ Fortnite!!
---
me too i killed sarkoth, burning blade medallion guy and zalazane by just stand at the front of the line, tagging him in a few tries with a target macro and dagger speed and then on my way to the next quest. I came back 2 hrs later and some of the dudes are still in line.
---
In my default setup for tukui I didn't have a clock. Or the bottom right textbox. And I don't see how to swap bags. What am I missing?
---
So sick of that run. Ran my human to teldrasil, nelf to sw. 
---
Then, after i thought i reset my hearth to goldshire, i hearthed back to nelf starting area....then at lvl 10 had to go back again for hunter pet quest.....
---
Is it possible to queue on one pc, boot up another and then quickly DC and switch to the other one while keeping your spot in the grace period?
---
It's because lots of streamers are rolling there, along with their cults.
---
Hiccups are bound to happen to every game launch. I'd say this one went quite smoothly and was perhaps way too successful. Blizzard is having a 1h maintenance this morning to adjust stuff. Tbh I was expecting it to go so wrong but instead it was so smooth! Yes some people got dced but the realms stayed up the whole time (at least on NA) and except for the 15 first minutes where everyone was on the same layer it was without any lag.
---
The ques were so bad that I thought I wouldn't be able to get on even if I did this. Woke up on time only to find that I could instantly get on my servers :/ rekt. I dont want to be at work lolol
---
This is exactly the unique experience that classic offers. If this was retail, than hunter would have one-shot all those creeps and probably tossed away the shield.
---
So happy Classic is back!
---
My rogue got 0 bags from level 1-10.5.
---
Rolled a mage cause my friends got off and I got 3 bags before level 5.
---
You know everything would be fine if players spread across all the servers. But no, everyone is too stubborn to switch, they would rather wait in queue than play.
---
I'm away from home and got this cheap laptop my parents bought. It barely plays the game with 20 fps on low and I can't really use the browser.
---
It's literally a character
---
Hörde du lirar med wiwa.
---
Do you have a clock in this? I can't see the time in my installation.
---
Even lots of people who are 60 right now are still working their asses off.
---
No,  but that's the only package really overhauling the UI
---

Did this to my Corsair mechanical with beer last winter. Thought it would be fine since I got it so fast but didn’t unplug it. A million chromes and a simple unplug. Took off all the keys and just let it do it’s thing for a few days. Worked good as new. Patience is a virtue with stuff like that.
---
And I'm missing it :( 
---
Are they doing the same patch schedules?
---
It might be possible that they will merge servers after some time, after the launch hype dies down
---
Barkinson for his Unstable Afflictions.
---
"Though victorious, the Night Elves were forced to sacrifice their cherished immortality and watch their beloved forests burn."
---
The foreshadowing is real.
---
He's done it 25 times, so how dare anyone else enjoy it. It sucks and it's boring cause he said so!
---
Those numbers will fool you. Medium still has a queue. Low is like vanilla *Full* with one layer.
---
lmao imagine lvl 10 is fast
---
people who are ahead of the zerg are at level 19-25
---
Beautiful! Ha, good thing the servers aren't classic hatdware. Good ole 2004 machines would have crashed with that many people on screen!
---
I wasnt shitting on it.  Serious. It will be interesting to see what happens in 12 or so weeks.... 
---
Did my tone not convey?
---
queuet meme
---
So once i get to character screen after queue it will never kick me out even if im still asleep haha?
---
Wait the servers are live now??
---
Im going zandalari too
---
the problem is nothing is comfortable with the this 3 fingers. But the community help me here so we see us in the game :)
---
I was in a call with a friend and same thing happened to him on Firemaw, while I was in queue for 5k+. It instantly put me in the moment he dc'ed, he also couldn't get back in which is odd since there's that grace period after a dc. We figured it's likely they booted 1 group of people and let in a second group of people because the same thing happened all over.
---
Just roll low pop servers together later.
---
Not happening on mograine. Free for all here.
---
They likely want to avoid server merges as people always scream "dying game" and freak the fuck out when server merges are mentioned.
---
Oh wow
---
To that guy who said "F" when the noob who tagged your murloc died to it, thanks for the laugh.
---
Well I got left my game open too long in character select and I got disconnected.
---
They enabled more layers and therfore increased server caps. Was 12k (4 layers) before, now its probably up to 6 or 8.
---
You were warned 😅😁
---
Oh nooo, that sucks :-(
---
Again launch of an xpac isn't the same as the launch of an entire game, we were tens of thousands of people popping at the exact same place at the exact same moment obviously it can't go all well but maybe 75% of the people did actually play the game and the others had to stay in the queue for a few hours
---
Careful, can't go against the circlejerk. Here JAB is a little bitch who has never done anything right and that guy in the hoodie is literally Jesus and that's just how things are.
---
There’s something oddly absurd about enough people being in queue for a server to actually fill a whole other server.
---
what realm ?
---
For people that are running their characters from one starting area to another, is it just because you prefer other starting zones, are playing with friends or is it a rep thing? Saw a bunch of level 2 elves in the gnome starting area and not sure why?
---
are the two mutually exclusive?
---
Nope
---
Yes well ofc there are new people and its fun to help them but there are obvious assholes in there too.
---
Thinking af playing WoW Classic. Never played WoW before but always considered it. What would I be getting into as a new player?
---
If you can. Germany only has 2 one PvP and one PVE.
---
The actual play here is to disregard quests in the starting zone and just grind up to 4-5 to leave the starting area asap and get out of the crowded areas.
---
I love the idea of the queue, but yeah it's not really practical to wait *that* long for a single mob when you could kill 20+ in that time for more exp.
---
Now you just have do so the same thing every day :)
---
Love it, I went the the orc zone as an Undead, and a troll tried to tell me to go back to my land lmao
---
But those were also free.
---
Ahh yess. They truly captured the vanilla experience
---
Yes, but the ques are INSANE on pvp realms now. 5-6 hrs
---
The funny thing is, I don't really remember having issues at launch. Kinda like this time, I've been able to play the whole time without disconnects.
---
Cheers. 
---
***Quaff's beer deeply to WoW Classic's launch***
---
Everyone is in the same boat of a streamer gets fucked by the queue who gives a shit especially for asmon
---
You can never be too sure about these things, but there is just one of those RP-PvP servers in EU, and there's historically always been demand for that. I don't think it'll have grouping issues due to population.
---
wait in queue for login so you can finally wait in queue for quest mob.
---
Haha nice one
---
Bad news everyone
---
Didn't know zygore had a classic levelling guide?
---
Actually no it isn't, the best in slot for level 19 is meadow ring of eluding from wailing caverns

---
The only viable? No, Druid is almost on par, and Paladins and even Shamans are VIABLE to tank raids. But for the last two you will need a group that knows what they're signing up for.
---
Optimal? Yes. Warrior is by far the best tank in Vanilla. Even tho Druid is also fine if you have 2 equally geared and skilled players, the one playing Warrior will have an easier time, leaving more room for error for the DPSs/Healers.
---
Its most of the time even more
---
The first tip cant help me i can use the other 3 fingers but not very exact \^\^
---
the nostromo looks like a idea thank you
---
Also, Windows has "Snipping tool" which works great for taking smaller screenshots.
---
Wait what? I thought they said no maintenance? Did something change?
---
So out of curiosity, I did a "bbw vore" google search, and found mostly, not to anyones surprise, a lot of pornhub videos, but just by skipping through them fast, they seemed like regular "bbw" videos..so I'm not left wondering what IS vore in this context? :o
---
This
---
Anyone know why this isn't self casting when I have no target?
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cancelform
---
    /cast [@mouseover, help][@target, help][@targettarget, help] Thorns
---
works fine on mouseover targets, but not me when there is no target. I've tried turning off 'auto-cast' in the interface, same issue.
---
Leatrix does the job!
---
And they say horde are the animals. I skipped the garrick quest in northshire abbey cos it was literally a fuck fest.
---
I use my mouse to move by clicking in both of the buttons and I turn with my mouse as well. Literally move with only my right hand and my left is really only needed in order to walk backwards
---
Nelf area is notoriously bad from what I've heard. There's a post about how nelfs run from their zone to the gnome zone.
---
that’s what happened to me
---
The entire draw of the game for me is world PVP. I'd rather not play than play normal servers tbh.
---
Love how blizzard shit the bed with the servers for their biggest release in a decade.
---
Solved: the addon Leatrix Plus does the job, just tried it!
---
It is available on the twitch app or curse forge.
---
I'm pretty sure it saves your place for like 5 mins if you alt+F4 and log back in. Idk how it works switching PCs though
---
That's part of why I rolled on Herod, I don't get to play on launch due to 20k queues, and was expecting to not be able to play this week and am fine with it. But it guarantees that when the dust settles there will still be people on my server.
---
But he had a change of heart. That's a good sign, no?
---
I leveled in Mulgore on Flamelash and actually managed to pull ahead of the entire group of levelers. For a short while I had Razorflank and the entire area all for myself, it was *glorious*.
---
Just wait for the fuckers if they ever get to stranglethorn vietnam and have to do that painful gorilla giblet quest. Boy are they gonne be in for a surprise
---
Some talk of a 5 minute protection when dced but i wouldnt be too hopeful
---
These are streamers people watch anyway, no matter what they do. You don't watch streamers for the game, you watch for them.
---
I was literally just looking for the same thing ha!
---
INFO AT ALL!!
---
THIS ADDON IS NUGRUNNING, not cast duration!
---
U can change position when u click on unlock at the addon NugRunning!
---
The grace period only seems to work if the DC was not because of a server crash. My guess is that the list of people that are logged in is kept in ram so when a server completely crashes the list of people that were logged in gets wiped.
---
Considering that those mobs were being spawn camped at every spawn by like 3 or more people waiting to insta-tag, no it wouldn’t have been better.
---
Literally switching from Gehennas because last night was like 40% Swedish in chat.
---
Can we appreciate that Blizzard changed their mind and gave us Classic.
---
I did it as an orc to mulgore. I do it for rep with TB as rep from quests scale with the color of the quest. An added bonus was waaaay less people.
---
IT´s also two PVE
---
/#TheyDidTheMath
---
Probably yes to be with friends, or theres an optimal levelling method over there, plus you need to do it at some point anyway, and before level 10 there’s no level sickness and repairs nonexistent.
---
Even though it has a high queue come to Golemagg, very friendly server so far and lots of guilds to join plus all the tryhards went to Shazzrah so we good !
---
The most fun mmo you have ever played.
---
Thank you i will try it :)
---
Not as a horde..
---
The only reason you got it so quickly was because you ran by everyone else who had organized into a line. If it was just chaos it would have taken you much longer. Taking advantage of other people's decency is an asshole move.
---
Actually not exaggerating. I quit WoW after that. But then I mained Resto druid so having my whole kit changed to play like every other healer was really upsetting.
---
When will the ques be gone?
---
Ask yo mama
---
Samuel fipps? Wait. I did this on stress test in a group. Worked fine.
---
Honestly it's ok now. It was a mess first 3 hours or so.
---
Is that to kill a mob and/or collect a quest item?
---
I have 1 gbit upload and download fibre with unlimited gigs per month bandwidth that costs me £35 a month ($43).
---
2 pvp and 2 pve
---
He has the most "punchable face" on the internet....like....all the way through mega dragon punch...
---
Fuck that. If I wanted to play a solo RPG I'd play something else.
---
Thanks i will try it :)
---
taking a photo of your screen in 2019 :D
---
No, cos people want to spout the "tHiNk YoU Do" crap at us. Like I get it but... Blizzard relented... they see it as a positive now trust me.
---
No simple answer to it, it’s a bit harder and doesn’t hold your hand as much. Give it a go.
---
If you're new I'd recommend not to have any add-ons honestly. And after a while if you feel you really are missing on something specific look if there's an add-on that can help with that.
---
But you really miss on most aspects of the game if you're using too many 'addons especially the ones like questie
---
You think it did, but it didn't.
---
Imagine your entire existence consisting entirely of just trying to shit on others on reddit. Must be a sad, lonely existence mate. Grow the fuck up.
---
How is queue for golemagg now? Im going home from work in 3 hours,hope it will be better
---
Can you interact with NPCs? My Undercity looked the same. Turned out I just couldn't connect as there were too many players. Eventually I connected and a zillion players appeared.
---
Wasn't expecting a 11k and a 7k queue on a tuesday noon on EU... cmon people, get back to work!
---
&gt;This is FULL ON idiot.
---
Yeah, were you saying the same when Blitzz allowed Questie as an addon?
---
Except for Dwarves Priests
---
He asked about bringing back servers from older expansions
---
I gave up yesterday and thought it was smart to go to bed early to dodge a long queue by playing early morning. Yep, still in queue for several more hours. The weekend will be atrocious, I guess it will definitely take more than a few weeks to really start playing. I am also jealous of the people that can play without interruptions once in. I have several responsibilities that require me to step away from my PC every so often, which makes it impossible with these queue times.
---
QUEUED
---
Update your OS.
---
Everyone was doing this on Incendius in the Dwarf/Gnome start zone. Made me super happy!
---
I pressed enter while in que and then I quit en relogged. My place was saved.
---
Can confirm. Am german
---
welcome to a 4k vanilla pop
---
fuuuuuckkkkk nooooo that is unreal.
---
Who would actually think of something like that in preperation... I always skip things like Hardware requirements...
---
That reaaalllyyy sucks! I guess it's time to get a cheap Laptop or an upgrade for your PC....
---
I hope you can get this all Sorted asap :/
---
I logged out of Grobb half an hour ago and there was a hunter level 21.
---
I second this. Vanguards the rank 1 paladin has always played with walk as holding both mouse keys down. So u can just use that and pretty much just bind spells from there on. If u want to bind walking backwards for those tricky parkour jumps then u can ofcourse. Hope this helps
---
My laptop died last year and since then I've been using my 10 year old pc...Classic was a game i was kinda lookin forward not only because i enjoy vanilla but also i thought the reqs would be fine for my pc...
---
I've been saying it since they announced servers. This launch is gonna be a queue infested shitshow. To blizzard: I told you so!
---
Stuff like this will start happening now that people can't get ahead of the curve. Nothing better than getting into quests before the mass of people.
---
 At launch, it was steal what you can and give nothing back.
---
Ive gotten the impression that he exhibits traits of narcissism, so he probably doesn't feel much as far as guilt goes.
---
This sounds hilarious to me. Reminds me of dark souls 1, which was similarly stupidly unbalanced but there were so many wacky situations that could happen with other players that I loved it. And this game is probably not dead, and has a chat box! 
---
Not gonna lie tho that 15 a month might kill it for me. If a standard AAA game costs $60, with this game i pay $60 just for 4 months of an extremely old game :/ dont know if my friends and i can afford that.  However not beinf p2w is definately a plus.
---
What realm is this?
---
I actually did not have problems at all in mulglore, all you have to do is step a little away from the obvious areas. Like i was farming two plainstriders behind the village nearly without competition.
---
Mograine was 3.5K 90 minutes ago when I joined the queue
---
Which server should I pick?
---
Lol... such a ***short*** line
---
They need to fire that guy
---
Well sure but you and I aren't going to be around forever.
---
I specifically moved to a recommended realm, "Mograine" to avoid queues. And here I am in a 160 minute queue on a Tuesday morning...
---
Rockin with my 10 year old pc since my laptop died xD
---
It’s quite easy to explain in fact. Someone that connected 5 seconds before you might want to disconnect, plus, you have more probability that one person, ahead of the line, is disconnected from the queue when there is 9000 people ahead than 2
---
No, add-ons have been around since vanilla. So have guides n shit. Want questie? Use it, don't demand other people have it shoved down their gullet in classic.
---
Welcome to being old.
---
That did it. Thanks!
---
My laptop died a while ago....rockin with my 10 year old pc since then
---
Just find a tailor. It only needs 6 linen cloth and 3 threads per bag and is a great way to level up tailoring.
---
I definitely plan to set up shop in Goldshire and do exactly this.
---
That's why I picked an EST RP server; it's the only one of it's kind, not just a generic PVP server. There will always be a playerbase.
---
Lmao, a keyboard warrior huh? - funny enough, i’m from Denmark and we havent Got a Wendy’s, unfortunately for you.
---
And here I thought that the reason that I didn't see anyone else when I was lvl 11-12 yesterday was the sharding. Maybe I was just the only one not to be disconnected until the server restarts.
---
Almost two years ago in the 2017 Blizzcon. What do you mean last year?
---
We all know what happens next.
---
Wow website shows that the servers are at low to medium right now mostly across the board in EU and in the us (though it is before sunrise in tbe US).
---
Are these numbers accursrw, ie there are currently no queues?
---
It depends. Do you enjoy doing your quests when suddenly a rogue pops up, kills you without you having any chance to prevent that, then camps your corpse to kill you again as soon as you respawn, all while he's doing insulting emotes? Then PvP is the server type for you.
---
Low pop every time. You will be able to transfer for free (and worst-case pay for it).
---
If you're wasting 4-8hours trying to get into queue and you can just pay £15(or W/E) to transfer later on then that's a good trade of value to time.
---
Pretend you're interested in BFA and contact CS
---
Oh I remember the frustration of server resets and unexpected downtime. It varied between servers, my particular one had straight *days* of downtime.
---
As for this launch: I skipped the start and woke up early to play instead. Had a short queue, played for 3 hours, then randomly disconnected and was put in a 9k queue.
---
That was 3 hours ago. I'm still an hour or two away from getting in.
---
My buddies are telling me the queue is at 18k now.
---
Thank fuck I’m playing on an RPPVP server.
---
Here i am just remembering the tram... after i make the walk to loch modan. At level 11 mage what's the best spot to quest??
---
Yeah, I got in 1 minute early as well. Been playing since on Skeram. I'm not a fast leveler, but I have the time.
---
but it's an authentic classic launch isn't it? ;)
---
On EU there are plenty of low and medium pop PvP realms.
---
J Allen Brack is such a cnut.
---
Went from 9000 down to 3000, only took 5 hours
---
I am 12 lvl now and i have only one bag dropped.
---
No problem! Have lots of fun! :D
---
Did anyone actually ever claim that MC would be cleared within a week of the server launch?
---
That’s how it works for sure. After I got booted was put in a queue again :( And since Kalimdor and EK can exist separately if one continent crashes the people on other can not even notice it
---
Ye i dont understand why they have so few servers for guilds and friends to choose from....
---
Check out the Reddit poll with almost 60k participants:

It's just a rough estimation though.
---
Honestly didnt even feel lile layers was added (bur it had to be) over 500 undead in my intro cinematic was insane.

I don't know him, but if he acts like a jerk 'just as a character' he kinda sounds like a jerk.

I prefer the huddle and smashing tab and t
---
I was first to /yell "first" on my server. no joke.
---
I can't fucking WAIT for Stranglethorn. 
---
I know, I'm probably the worst human being in existance, but I loved collecting the Green Hills
---
#teamsomechanges
---
I did that as well but am worried it will disconnect me before I get home for inactivity? Or is that not a thing?
---
I've been in the queue for 2.5hours. Position 2300 atm.
---
Thank you so much! I Will try that :)
---
I only grouped with strangers once and it was a just because moment. Rolled Troll shaman, got to echo islands to do Zalazane and it was just a big group of people trying to get the first hit. We actually all agreed that it was ridiculous and decided to form a line and people actually stuck with it for a good 30 minutes. It was still a little clustered in the line so i suggested party leaders only in the line and when it was the next party leaders turn their group form up on his spawn. It was very fluid and everyone loved it, and people in my stream were just kinda baffled that forming a line was working, and that it lasted so long. And since I was solo when my turn came and I was just standing there by myself i invited a few randos. It kinda fell apart then because new people just came in and ruined it but hey, it still worked  for awhile.
---
Day after launch? The game launched 12 hrs ago. Hardly a day, is it?
---
It's been like this all night for me. Not just at 5am. I've only ever seen a couple people walking through SW. Even when I first entered SW around 11pm. It's strange too since I had a 1.5 hour queue. My server was definitely packed. Just not on my layer.
---
lmao, thanks bro, Will do :)
---
See it say it sorted
---
Within a few hours me and this other guy were trying to corner the wand market in Brill. We ended up talking through a mutual customer, and I ended up learning a lot from him about how to up my vanilla profession game. We ended up with an unspoken agreement that he would sell in Brill and I in Undercity.
---
The whole time I was selling, I was meeting the friendliest people who were excited to level them some wand skills. Some willing to haggle, others who wanted to barter instead.
---
Then I sold to someone who helped me from 3 Scarlet Warriors I accidentally pulled. As I gave him a discount on his wand it hit me. This is what it was like to have a pervasive server community. Where your interactions with other players do matter, because these are the people you'll be going to for enchants, or flasks, and raids or dungeons.
---
I think there is almost no queue on Skeram now. Was like 6-7 hours earlier.
---
I was talking about this classic launch not wow in general.
---
People crying because layering shows too little people.
---
People crying because layering still shows too many people.
---
You will laugh at this then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0
---
Isn't there a missed opportunity here with "Dongtickles_69" ?
---
Level 16 in 8 hours?
---
I love a clever rouge name!
---
Starting to think that #MaybeSomeChanges
---
That's the plan of Method. And it actually can happen.
---
A lot of people laugh at this guy while using addons that literally does this exact thing, pretending they're any better. Addons was the single biggest mistake of WoW, and it should be considered cheating.
---
JodieFroster is still waiting her turn after queue troubles last night
---
Small brown pouch
---
They got the same guy who estimated the required number of Classic servers to write the wait time calculation.
---
awesome, thanks!
---
It would be a waste to ~~play~~ afk during launch and Classic isn't going anywhere.
---
Play f2p/currently owned titles and wait until you have enough spare change to get a sub.
---
Why dont you just wait for the queue times to blow over and roll an alt on a high pop realm?
---
Haha looks like a waste of time tho
---
Very cute! Hope you had a wonderful launch as well! :D
---
yes. then probably pokemon go
---
Saw this live, I hate to say it but Asmons tears kinda make me happy lmao
---
That is called hype and will die down soon enough.
---
&gt;add-ons have been around since vanilla
---
Who gives a shit. If there had been no addons in classic, would you be pushing that addons like Questie should not exist today?
---
Aah, even emulating my internet from 2006. Good times.
---
There is a grace, but unsure how long. Successfully logged out and exited game twice tonight and was able to hop right back in.
---
Golemagg 11k queue, 240 mins
---
[GIFV link](https://i.imgur.com/BvVBpXW.gifv)
---
i remember doing the same thing on the same mob
---
You can buy them 2.5 silvers (I think?). They are 6 slots and sold near the trailor vender.
---
My game was &lt;1 minute for like 30 minutes.
---
Disgusting
---
Did you sub for $15?
---
17k was just now.
---
Honestly, trying to quest in the first little areas is pointless. Just vrind mobs until you hit 4 or 5.. Much faster..
---
11k+ on gehennas as well

Some level 7-8 quests give 5-6 silver as reward so 8-12 silver is barely anything at level 10.
---
You running this on a Commodore 64?
---
That was given to random players in their "gifts" on the launcher. If you don't have it, already then you aren't going to get one right now. A lot of people are going to play classic for a few days and then quit. Blizzard will see no reason to give free time to them when they know a good amount of those people will drop a monthly subscription just to try classic.

I've had nothing but positive social encounters so far and have 15 new guild mates who are all on a fast path to success.

1 week is possible if 40 people all play 24/7. But I doubt they could even get enough rep to dose the ruins. Not to mention they need to pray tranq shot drops or they are screwed.

Yes, I was among the lucky ones who was alone and switching server last minute to medium pop wasn't a problem.

You described my experience 100%, sitting in discord and being the only one out of 15 people who can't play sucked lol

I guess it's better than the first single named quest mob...
---
I hate to bring it up, but with sharding is faction imbalance even something worth worrying about at this point?
---
Lucifron the German PvP Server is unplayable. 17.000 Queue right now. 
---
 I logged in right at 0001, then got disconnected at 0110 and was in Queue for like 5hrs. Then I played 30mins and the Servers went down for an hour. Then I played 1-2 more hours and my whole Guild got DCed again and since then we are stuck in a Queue up to 20.000 Players.

How long is the queue on Mograine at the moment?
---
Why are servers listed as “Medium” but have several thousand in the queue? When I finally gave up last night only 4 servers were listed as High. The rest were medium but every single one of them had a queue.
---
Are dwarves and gnomes overrepresented on German servers? I know you love those little bastards, I've seen your garden.
---
If this is your first time you can pick up the battle chest cheap on somewhere like CDKeys and you get a month included which is cheaper than a regular sub.
---
If you log on to the battle net website and select the WoW game it should tell you your username in the top right
---
You can use something like the [Logitech G13](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G13-Programmable-Gameboard-Display/dp/B001NEK2GE) and use the joystick with your thumb for movement.
---
Has anyone tried logging in to your account from another computer? Will you hold your spot on the server or get queue if you manage it in a few seconds?
---
Oh boy and when you don‘t let them the towel fun they get rly angry and talk about getting the manager. Happened to me once. It was a shit show
---
I dont now if there will be transfers from low pop to full realms... be aware of that. I am not going to low pop realm for sure.
---
There’s a literal stream of people racing. Streaming from Vegas with Method and MSI as partners.
---
Yep there’s 10 pvp servers and only one doesn’t have some kind of queue
---
The Starter Edition is for retail only.
---
Imagine playing on a PVE server
---
I.... See....

Thankyou 🙂

Wow was the MMORPG that went truly mainstream on a scale never seen before. That's the very definition of casual-friendly (even though I assume peak player base was somewhere in Lich, but at the same time people started to leave around then). The genius is that everyone can find something to do.

It depends on how the DC happens. If the server kicks you off it won't save your place but if you kick yourself off it will.

Bless you man,if my fps goes below 100 i freak out

I can't really speak for Japan. But we had access to uncapped 100mbps in the year 2000 in northern friggin Sweden. I have a feeling that Japan was a bit further ahead than that.
---
It might have something to do with that you know that buff will actually help them out a bunch and they know it as well. When questing and killing mobs is a challenge every bit helps, so a buff will be much more appreciated.
---
same dude
---
I wasn't aware of that I'm sorry
---
Nothing is changed. Get use to it
---
The final form is Lil Nightsaber xD
---
meanwhile in EU: yep and only like 4 german servers, still no new ones. all Servers are on a queue, all day around, even the filthy PVE ones. we coulndt even choose a low pop one even if we wanted to.
---
Most of them were waiting in queue
---
It's called jobs
---
Firemaw-EU had 27k because the Spanish community decided to instead go on there to avoid the queue's on Shazzrah.. it made everything worse. So much worse..
---
Some of the new realms also have queues already. Morgraine for example.
---
Why don't you think noggenfogger will stay populated?
---
They made some really good changes that negatively affected the game more than anyone anticipated.
---
Flying mounts are cool. But there's little world pvp unless you're in front of a summoning stone or dungeon. Now it's so lopsided it doesn't matter.
---
Dungeon finder helped with the LFTank for arbitrary level dungeon everyone hates like Mara. Must have key! But it took out player interaction because you just dump those people whenever. Same with scaling raids and LFR.
---
They need to add more servers and add option to transfer characters soon. Or just let players quit the game so queue gets shorter lol.
---
I skipped all teh Defias Quests in Northshire and just grinend wolves. No idea why you would do that. But I soloed Hogger without a Grp while literally 10+ others were standing around me, not wanting to invite me. Karma is a bitch baby!
---
Yup. We all were planning to go Skeram. Still will. But the queue was unreal. Went to a medium pop server to get my fix, logged off once to try and fix some add-ons, come back 35 minutes. Not bad but it kept going up.
---
Thanks, I will look into it :)
---
No, NELF zone is fine, but you need to get to Ironforge/Stormwind sooner or later and some prefer sooner.
---
Flamelash
---
Too afraid to go off the program incase it crashed lol.
---
In the last 30 days?
---
&gt; everyone and their dog will be doing so
---
Best time to jump on the bandwagon imo. People are more likely to check out different streamers while sitting in queue or whatever.
---
Mostly just the PvP ones from what I've seen
---
Just upgrade your OS to a 64bit system? A windows 10 key is 4pounds in the right place.
---
Yeah I got in instantly but got kicked out after an hour or so. Just enough time to get some basics done. Not excited to see how long it takes me to get in when I try in a few hours.
---
At this point i think it is safely to assume Low, medium and high define the length of the queue, all Servers are full
---
Yo I’m lvl 16 too hmu when u log on tomorrow and we can party up
---
Damn, man - haha. Hope you slept in between that. I played from 00:00 to 6 AM then EU server restarted and I went to sleep. Am half to level 12, and 5000 in queue..
---
You know that most MMOs have this issue at launch, right?
---
I feel like autoshoot has randomly a couple of extra ms cast time every now and then, am I going insane?
---
I only started classic cause it's quite casual and work-friendly. You can tons of time to catch up to everyone and there is no rush. Content is released in phases and there is not too much to do in this first phase that more than likely will last 3-4 months
---
"low" pop? Won't be really low, will still be filled as funk
---
And thaaaats why you don't play on Streamer Servers 🤣
---
Then you would have bunch of dead servers, but agrees they could have added atleast 4 in the beggining instead of 2
---
Whitemane was almost 1000 minute queue
---
Think I spent an hour total trying to get zalazanes head :((
---
How many quests are locked behind earlier quests being complete? If I skip a few in the starting zone for example, will I miss a lot of quests later because of that?
---
And that's when little Timmy realized that vanilla wasn't the amazing, dreamy wonderland he thought it was.
---
You bitches wanted the vanilla experience
---
Those guys were late comers. Retail is their baby incorporating their ideas, classic isn't, and some pretty vocal people don't like it. I'm not sure I'd be able to handle the criticism much better in their shoes.
---
Haha same, tried at launch, 21K+ in queue, 213min.  
---
I'm in disbelief at the circlejerk in these comments. We're on day 1 of release. Make this meme in a week and it'll be justified.
---
Same time i got booted. But it was just on time for when i needed to go to bed
---
Sorry but last night at launch Firemaw had one of the biggest queues, over 20k+. It's nowhere near the smallest pop server.
---
Same. And the people telling him to jUsT cHAnGe ReAlM dUh . Germans only got 2 pvp servers and the other one is equally fucked 6k+ queues.
---
In awake since launch and only got to play for around 1h30min because of disconnects that throw you back to the end of the queue. On top of all that you go on twitch and every fucking NA server seems to run smoothless. I have yet to encounter a disconnect or server crash on one of the big NA streams.

---
Who the hell made lines in vanilla
---
There is an offline version, someone shared the link here on reddit... i was using it but currently at work cant share it.
---
You can play Overwatch while in queue just fine!
---
I would suggest going Hunter or Warlock those classes are the best for solo level since you will have a pet for you who can tank the damage up.
---
Jesus you guys are really making me want to play when I get home from work
---
I know that Firemaw queue times is going to decrease eventually, but as a  measure for blizzards own fault (imho) they should add more layers and bigger capacity.
---
Not in classic unfortunately.
---
I got in the queue 3 hours 20 mins ago - 10k queue, i'm now 2400. Still estimated 53 minutes. It's going to be a long week
---
"Gibt gleich laserschelle" hahaha
---
Well I'm not gonna play on a low pop server alone when all my friends play on a high pop one.
---
You can be idle. I was idle most of my 5 hour queue earlier.
---
&lt;Legacy&gt;
---
Legacy is a classic wow guild looking to recruit semi-hardcore players who are looking to have fun in a friendly,non-toxic enviromenent.We will be raiding casually with 2 teams, raiding every Friday and Sunday.
---
What server are we on?:We will be playing on Shazzrah EU
---
What faction are we rolling?:We will be rolling horde.
---
If i play an off-meta class such as boomkin is there a spot for me in raids?:Yes! We are not a min-max guild, we are all here to have fun with the class we enjoy

When switching realms (or after a realm merge) how does it work with character names? Does 1 person of an identical name have to select a different name (and if so, which one)?
---
I was position 20k on Stalagg but jumped over to Kromcrush the second I saw the blue post. Got immediately in and got to play with no queue.
---
I got the pattern, pretty happy.
---
We’ll see what happens in a few weeks.  These streamers chasing views won’t be around long.
---
/r/classicwow: idk how people watch him, he's super toxic. So bad for the community
---
Also /r/classicwow: HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO CRY LOL
---
Joined a low server and got in right while my original 'medium' server had a 3000 person queue at 2am EST.  There was still a healthy number of players to contend with for quests. Since Blizzard has promised transfers in the event of low population just level up on a low server for now and worry about population levels later =P
---
I don't have a queue time on any realm right now though.
---
Have u made a char yet
---
I started 4 minutes after launch, no queue. Logged off to take care of a few things and came back 2 hours after launch, and only had 10m queue on the same server.
---
I played from the second login time with two brief logoff times (adjust mods) with no further queue, and no disconnects. Made it to level 12 in about 8 hours as druid. Level 10-12 took like nearly 3 hours of that, mostly for various walk times for completing quests (druid quest line for bear had a lot of walking). 
---
Old Blanchy is my server.
---
Lupos was normalized to no longer do shadow damage in 1.12 iirc, The Rake and Broken Tooth still have their attack speeds.
---
i am in the lucifron queue right now. 16k ppl 5h queue :D
---
Wish it was my first time too. Absolutely perfect feeling exploring it
---
Sweet
---
I premade my 3 characters on Shazzrah, but obviously now they've put up more servers- should I stick with my original server choice or are some of the others looking more promising now?
---
Been watching the queue usung teamwiever from work., now when I'm in i just afk jump every 15min :)
---
Was wondering this, must work for getting into ghilneas aswell
---
I'm normally in bed by 9:30 PM. Last night I pushed it to 11:00 PM because of how much fun I was having. Woke up this morning bleary-eyed and a bit groggy. No regrets.
---
Yeah, but if I were to change server today half of my friends would stay behind and play on Firemaw and the rest would play on the other server, splitting up a group kinda sux.   
---
I'm patient and can wait but it just feels lame that this happened even though Blizzard stated wich servers were gonna be full and not :)
---
That's rough. I'm around 6k now.
---
is there an android app for remote controlling my pc from work so I can log in queue before I come of work? xD
---
Remember unkillable level 10s when they reworked resilience :D
---
On the international 2019 was 1m or more like 1.1-1.3
---
Players having additional characters does not cause queues. They can only ever be logged in to one of them at a time.
---
A lot of people don't even use a and d to turn.. Holding the right mouse button is a better option and is what I do. As far as spell casting. I point and click a lot of my spells for the most part. It's not ideal for super hardcore raidering and pvp'ing, but I still manage to have fun. Try that out, maybe?
---
Dude when classic launched there were literally so many people in the starting zone that it took me 25 minutes before I could even kill 8 wolves
---
When it says “go south to x” you go south to x. If you forget where the questgiver is, you’re a dumbass, but the details also say that
---
Play whatever you want and don't worry if it's the right choice or not. Be social and help others. Don't rush through leveling to get to end game, leveling is half or more of the game. Pick up everything(grey items specifically) l and vendor it, gold can be hard to come by if you are new.
---
It was during pre-making characters, it was the least populated PvP server pre-launch.   
---
Blizzard stated that these servers were gonna be the bigshot servers with 10k+ queues.  
---
 
---
* **EU**  
---
* Shazzrah – PvP
---
* Golemagg – PvP
---
Yup thats the plan. I finish work in 3 hours. I will start queue in a bit. 
---
But my gear is that once i get home if log from my pc to dc my laptop that i get put back in queue.
---
Yea sorry I get that.
---
Is method showing everyone? I thought it was a few select people? I think there's unknown streamers further ahead..?
---
Was gonna play on Mankrik because fuck trying to level on a packed pvp server that could potentially be imbalanced. 
---
Swapped to westfall when they opened it and didnt look back. 
---
Was able to log in at around 130pm PST and stayed logged in until it went live. Got in and joined the madness of leveling with 200 other people. Stayed on til 230 am PST with no problems.
---
Look at those funbags!
---
For the 20k+ queue to go away there has to be ppl willing to leave otherwise the queue will never change. It’s all a matter of who caves first
---
Wut lul
---
Quest givers are also marked on the map when you're close enough.
---
Yes, come on board!
---
Look up the world record lvl 60 and mc foesnt even need lvl 60 iirc you just need alot of redbull and cocaine but its possible :)
---
This is what has annoyed me. We all expected queues launch day (he'll, it's part of the charm) but Aussie's really got shafted on this one. Gonna have mates spread out everywhere
---
Sad for our culture
---
Didnt know they had canadian servers?
---
Thanks man
---
Win + Shift + S is very useful too for just showing one part of the screen. Can also simply ctrl + V the pic into Discord for sharing things with your guild.
---
Don't sweat it dude. Don't rely on WASD anyways because you'll be keyboard turning.  You want to be moving your screen with your mouse and you can also move your character by holding both buttons down. You could literally play wow on just one mouse. It's pricey but the [razer naga](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEU_en-GBGB834GB834&amp;q=razer+naga&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI38ud8aLkAhXKGewKHX7kAKsQBQguKAA&amp;biw=988&amp;bih=638) allows you to do this and it has 17 buttons!
---
its a full realm now?
---
Just one advice: play. Pick the class that fits your mindset and aesthetics best, and start. You'll shortly find someone to play with - the game's population on launch is huge. You'll also find your first guild shortly.
---
Don't listen about DPS tiers, usefulness in raids and other end-game crap. For now it's not for you. Just dive in, read quests, explore. Enjoy.
---
Incendius server wasn’t like this lol. Everyone was stacked up. Luckily I somehow managed a hit after 3 attempts
---
I'm in the same boat at you good man
---
They won't even get to 60 in one week.
---
I'm retarded - sorry!
---
Pretty sure wow had like 5 or 6m subs in classic, there was no wow prior to classic
---
Now I do lmao
---
Not really, most of the mobs that queues have formed for aren't essential in any way
---
chrome remote desktop is what i use on ios, would be weird if it wasnt available on android.
---
Crazy amounts... seriously
---
It’s literally 2004 simple lmao take off the rose tint I raid progressively it’s not difficult
---
Elvui look pretty futuristic and you can customised in 1000 ways and one. It is a complete ui overhaul though, so its not the easiest to use if youre not familiar with it IMO.
---
Was sitting at my computer last night watching the clock count down to 11pm.  20seconds early the enter world button went red! I smashed that mouse button and was taken into the loading screen, the bar stopped at like 90% my heart stopped for a moment, had my pc crashed? Nope! a few minutes later it completed and I WAS IN!!!
---
I skipped the cutscene, and appeared at the starting point of valley of trials, hundreds and hundreds of players started to appear!  I rushed to grab my first quest, first thing I noticed was the intense lag.  I grabbed my first quests (boars ) and ran off in excitement to crush those cuddley piggies.   Everywhere I looked there were players all lagging about, it was a massacre.  Dead boars everywhere, I killed a few here and there, it was a lagging hell, but I managed to reach level 2 and picked up the apple quest, scorpids and vile familiars.  I ran off towards the injured troll to pick up the Sarkoth quest, trying to killing anything that was still alive.  I managed to collect all the apples while everyone was queuing up for Sarkoth.  
---
I ended up grouping with 5 people to complete the vile familiar and scorpid tails quests as quickly as humanly possible in the lag nightmare.  I stood in line for Sarkoth when I started telling people if they made a 5 man group for this mob things would speed up quicker, no one listen, I then asked to join a group and someone added me, I kill some mobs in the areas, for around 5 mins when someone from the group I was in got the tag for Sarkoth, win!  Off to hand everything in.  Reached lvl 4, collected the final 2 quests and logged out as it was 00:00 and I was up for work in 6 hours.
---
It wasn't perfect, but it was awesome.
---
No fucking shit. This is the CLEAR and OBVIOUS problem with requiring servers to get full before releasing new ones 2 weeks ago. 
---
Breadcrumb players are going to whatever server their friends chose. Period. 
---
Blizzard should have wanted all of their servers to be medium before launch today, not high or full
---
I use moonlight streaming
---
Poor wakanda
---
No, the old models will be the only option
---
as a new player it is probably best to pick race and faction according to your tastes, as you will be with them for a long time. Dont look up best classes or race benefits as it wil lruin your experience just go for it and explore.
---
Happend to me 2 after 30 mins of play but I've chose a rppvp server so only had a 3min wait so not bad at all
---
"You think you do, but you don't"
---
And that content isn't going anywhere when they release new stuff you'll still have to do it to be able to prepare for the next tier. No catch up mechanics.
---
last 2 expansions launched great
---
Dude it's the best game period in my opinion. 
---
Do you have autism? Other people have different opinions on things you know.
---
Says a lot about how insecure the retail community is. You'd rather be trolling people who are having fun than playing. LMAO
---
Will the game be at all playable with the Intel HD graphics from a i5 8400?
---
You didn't miss much, most of it was just sitting in the queue for hours.
---
Razorgore is at a medium population with a queue of 2376
---
No it'll be MAX 2 weeks. 1.12 talents MC, needing gear lul.
---
How is golemagg doing? Queue still in the 1000s? ;/
---
I hope you're going to be too late for the jump. 😅 So we will have one less player to wait for 😏
---
Because everyone has anti afk software
---
Have you bought the game yet
---
They said they prefer to avoid realm transfers or mergers so I wouldn't bet on it.
---
FN peaked at 1.3m, aye.
---
Were mages that strong at the end of vanilla? I recalled it as warlocks being one everyone whined about in pvp.
---
please read my post, not just the title.
---
bold of u to assume i have friends
---
I suspect they force dc'd the early players to get others a chance to play because there was a huge wave of dc'd players at the same time around 11pm est.
---
yeah i really wanna see who gets world first 60!!

if you're playing a melee class with a slow weapon, slow your enemy and back off until your next swing. You can hit them but they won't hit you.

Yeah i think im going to uninstall Classic and try to Install it to a different folder. Thanks for helping Cheers!
---
got a small blue pouch in my 3rd kill.
---
pretty good start.
---
Made it through one server dc without a queue 😏👍
---
In France we just play rugby around the objective
---
You answered it yourself. Already over a million people watching on Twitch. Like Blizzard would need any more promotion or advertising from streamers. Some of the bigger Twitch faces got completely fucked by disconnects and horrendous queues.
---
Sword made of lead...
---
Seems like it
---
Awesome, thanks for confirmation!
---
Of course its Tuesday, these queues driving me crazy already. :D
---
Theybarent trying to make a bunch of servers just for them to dienafter the tourists leave. Deal with then ques. Blizzard is playing this right.
---
naw Arugal
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
Everything that was normalized before patch 1.12 is out. So no shadow damage, bonus resistances or fast run speeds, but attack speed variation is in.
---
Cause others have to play too.
---
But hey i got a better one..
---
Why dont u just swap servers?
---
Especialy when you arent a part of a hc guild.
---
Or..
---
Aint it dump when pple try to estimate whats gona happen to a server, months from now, having as a standar that they will still be playing classic, which makes a few headstart days look pale and even  easy to discard by starting on a new realm?
---
Bch plz...
---
Is there a way to not get logged out when at the character seen? Like going to queue and go away for 2hours or so and the queue might be like 1h30mins, and I dont want to be disconnected from the character selection screen.
---
This is gonna be a stupid question but how do I even do skinning?.... I’m in the night elf area and grabbed the knife and profession but nothing I kill has been skin-able yet...

Don't spend gold on anything but skills (and maybe bags) early on, it's not worth it. Also, make sure you read the skills and if they don't look beneficial, don't buy them.
---
Was that the queue on Hydraxian Waterlords? I was there and we had a great Dwarf patrolling up and down yelling at us to move along and fill in gaps the whole time.
---
Everybody is doing that, not just Germans..
---
They most likely will. But MC will be tight, if they even get close in only seven days.
---
I would not conclude anything after one day of release.
---
dude i was the first to loggin on gehennas and got kicked out then i got into the queue, f\*\*\* blizz man, always streamer priority first
---
Not comparable
---
Rolling 'low pop' fosho. From what i reckon, i ser to play on Lightshope (vanilla p-server) with 3k+ ppl and It was awesome. 
---
You really dont need to Go to a 8k pop server because you are afraid to run into empty zones. It wont happen.
---
Hell, even on this last week of Lightshope with 1.5k pop u could easily easily find ppl to quest with and run dungeons.
---
He better not die again
---
Cmon...is this is first game ever? Can believe someone who played any game in their life  would make such a mistake...
---
Could make an alt for Disenchanting and have a gathering on your main
---
One in your timezone.
---
everyone teleporting around like goku
---
Are they streaming?
---
I guess not. Maybe if u get random dc u could get back but when the layer u got assigned to crashes there's just nothing to get back to so I guess that's why that happens.
---
I agree that they should have played on privates, BUT the lack of  permanent  security was offputting (proved correct) and some found it unethical.
---
big lag on eu
---
Brand new, never played a second of this game. If I pick a server now can I change later on to be on the same one as my friend? I don’t know what he picked besides Pve and I don’t want to wait 6 hours for him to wake up to find out...
---
Honestly would rather see Method totally fail lol.
---
Exciting
---
This is fantastic. lmao
---
Every server has absurd queues :D it's great.
---
You may as well delete that post, nothing you said is even remotely relevant to this game.
---
Happened twice on Lucifron. Both times eastern kingdoms crashed as I can see. Got kicked at about 9 am. 5000+ queue, 3 hour wait. Played for 20 min got kicked again. 16000 queue.
---
the guy said every release of everything
---
Because there’s too many people logging into that server. Maxing out layers etc.
---
You are Satan. SHAME!
---
They didn't lock the realms because they clearly told people not to roll on high pop servers. 
---
You can either roll on high pop and queue or roll on a new realm and play right away.
---
If they locked realms, you'd be forced to play on low pop realms. You can do that now anyway. You get a choice.
---
Not sure what you don't understand.
---
People forget, the undead were basically legit bad guys in vanilla.
---
J Allen Brack is spinning in his grave
---
I've already moved realm once, they should of locked it once full.
---
Didn't lose my position in the que for restarting the client.
---
I took the day off and was able to log in the second realms went live. It was super worth it.
---
Lil saber
---
well actually it is

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw2yc8/are_the_ahs_merged_for_each_of_the_cities_or/). 
---
If you realm change you normally get to pick a new name no matter if it's taken or not. There are no server transfers for classic atm. I don't think they've ever done server merges either, but I might be wrong on this one.
---
It was at launch, not at ridiculous oclock their time.
---
Nope. If the Server/layer/whatever crashes, you get to go to the back of the line.
---
Should have just moved on and skipped that quest. Cool community moment nevertheless.
---
GREAT JOKE OP HAHAHAHAHA LOL MEMEZ. Comedy awards here!!!
---
Hahahaha. No.
---
Lul :D Its all ready medium with fast 150player ques.
---
No, it was asked in the AMA but they said they don't intend to give us any number.
---
If you never played MMOs, they have the trickest controls and it prevented me for so long from playing wow.
---
I think if some servers end up low, they’ll likely merge. But probably not until after the first week or two.
---
And if those new servers die off; theyll most likely merge servers
---
My bud was the first to die of my friend group.
---
He drowned. He was too happy diving around old Echo Isles again and he forgot that Vanilla had like a minute of underwater air at best.
---
It isn’t even 24 hours, lol
---
Blizz giving you the bad karma you deserve
---
Is Character Transfer across realms available in WoW Classic? (I know that you have to pay 20 euro)
---
I haven’t gotten the chance to play yet either.. hopefully after work today I’ll get lucky with my que!
---
How are the ques on Fairbanks Alliance right now?
---
They are the go to healers for Raids and Dungeons afaik but levelling them is a real chore, especially if you plan on leveling solo.
---
Ive never played Go but it was a damn phenomenon. Remember "Pokémon go to the polls?"
---
7 hours for level 10 seems kinda rough. What happened?
---
I actually raided up to AQ40 in vanilla, and have been playing on multiple private servers since. I know what Naxx 40 takes lol. On most private servers, guilds clear Naxx the second day of release because of strategy guide and prep, and that's just not fun for me.
---
out of the loop probably
---
Here’s a link to a thread about it in the servers new subreddit! 
---
[Deviate Delight](https://www.reddit.com/r/deviatedelight/comments/cvycp4/i_made_a_discord_waiting_room_feel_free_to_join/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
Its an RP-PVP server (not RP-PVE)
---
How many PVP servers you think we need for OCE region? 1? Yeah we'll go with 1.
---
I am also very interested in this question.... have a feeling there will be way more priests than expected
---
You better do, cause in this game different classes and professions are complementary. It's damn hard to level up on your own.
---
By who? Lol
---
I tuned in to his stream for like 10 minutes earlier today and he said he was super-tired and about to fall asleep and that he would spend the day tomorrow fixing the site. All i know
---
Glad they didn't fix it, it's a pretty harmless "exploit" that's a lot of fun
---
I wonder if you can get to old ironforge still
---
I’m glad these servers were up, I mean, I lost my name placements, where I wanted to play had like a 22k queue, and these servers got me in a lot faster so that is nice. I got to level 12 today, and plan to play some more later today.
---
Also you cant just "gO oN a diFrEnt SerVer" because there are only two german pvp servers and they both have eternal qs
---
Yes, you absolutely could have considering this doesn't mean what u think it means
---
I just grinded up till lvl 5.Its more profit with THIS amount of people.
---
You need to buy a license for the North American version of the game.
---
Yes, yes it is. I have my reservations about being level 60 and having to run dungeons with limited time, but the sense of danger while questing combined with the struggle to improve my character even a tiny bit is so rewarding.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Ah okay, think it might just be the ones I'm killing. Thanks!
---
This  is an understatement
---
look at that necklace he's wearing... definitely European. 
---
Oh and doubt he'll be so excited to get home when you realize there's a further 1-2 hour wait to get on to your realm.
---
razer naga my friend
---
That's what the ignore button is for, that way I wont have to listen to people like you in game.
---
The default Blizz UI has this functionality.
---
Have you tried turning it on?
---
What was really annoying was the some of the ones they added that said low would have a queue time. Also the low ones if you got in would just say world sever down.
---
Thanks. I saw very few while questing. 10-1 maybe, mostly druids.
---
They said it in their AMA
---
Staged with a friend?
---
I guess you were right....6hr que for my buddy, then he gave up.  Bout that time my other friend got back and tried to log on, 12000 in que and estimated 517 min wait time....before he gave up and that was just shy of 7 hrs after launch.  We weren't on one of the biggest servers either.
---
But, to their credit the game ran great for me (&lt;1 min Q  *flex*).  21 servers up at this point, at least they were close.  Hopefully all those would be customers/fans have enough interest to stick it out.
---
I’m not even German. My point is what’s the point in having designated German realms for their community when they can’t even get in, and are forced to roll on english realms purely because blizzard didn’t make enough realms for them?
---
But he had to work until 6.
---
We will see in few days, noob. Vanilla dungeon difficult is so laughable that those players will just streamroll everything even on lvl 58.
---
Congrats!
---
Is it possible to boost a low level friend? If so whats the optimal thing to do, towing him through dungeons?
---
Im asking because we want to play as a group of friends with different disposable time.
---
Perhaps. If they desire to remove the player cap in the future this is obviously a pointless statistic. Just sharing my observations.
---
I'm sorry little one
---
*uninstall retail*
---
Above average I'd say.
---
Work is da poop! 
---
No more!
---
I got some weird shit where elvui basically crashes my MAP for some reason and makes it impossible to follow quests. Also seems to give a ton of LUI errors in combat.
---
I want to avoid the nightmare that my vanilla realm experienced. All the Alliance transferred to another realm when they were offered a free transfer. Leaving the realm devoid of any world PVP. Eventually most people stopped playing, and it become a hollow shell of what it once was.
---
I was thinking of going home at lunch just to queue myself up for when I get home at evening. I'm basically just sitting in a queue  to get into another queue.
---
You're correct actually, either way a bit advanced for a new player to worry about.
---
So no need to save them for later right? Maybe only some ores since i will go for engineering.
---
Spaniards and Italians both moved to Firemaw yesterday. They ended up with a 16k queue just for name reservations shortly after the announcement.
---
Heres my server 
---
https://imgur.com/a/KgMkoH3

He was the guy who originally asked blizzard if they ever were going to put legacy servers in
---
I switched over to Kromcrush, you can go AFK as long as you want there. I logged in, got my fiancee's recovered my fiancee's account, subscribed to wow, installed her client, made some pizza rolls (I'm 15 again after all), came back, changed my settings.
---
Didn't DC once, kinda ruined the vanilla experience tbh.
---
In which position?
---
Me too, I died a few times, every time I did I told the people of general and they all paid their respects with F.
---
I'm already 60, but my printscreen button is broken, my dog ate my phone and camera and I can no longer type due to my fingers having fallen off.
---
Source is a blue post dont be lazy just check it yourself
---
Ding ding, good call, it is bartender
---
5 hour wait for me, but server ran smoothly once I was in (Incendius).

---
Then leave.
---
Uf
---
It's adjusted to relative cap, so if a full server has 100000 players, a medium could be 70k and low could be 50k. and all can have queues
---
People who are subbed to /r/classicwow get the giblet 1st mob.
---
What the other guy said. Grab a US starter edition,  set up a subscription there and then you should be able to select your (new) US account for classic.
---
EU had that happen a couple of hours ago, It's people going to sleep/work. EU servers are now back to full with 10k in queue lol.
---
This is what target macros are for!
---
There was a lot of mooing going on in chat.
---
Exatly this, my friend. It is infuriating.
---
Everyone is constantly parroting this... yes, but now both us the customers and blizzard know better.
---
Don't party up with him, have him tag tons of mobs, you dps them down, he gets full xp.
---
I had a 45 Min Queue to get on Whitemane this morning at 5AM EST
---
Haha nah. I work Tuesday through Friday. Got lucky wow released on a Monday evening :)
---
Was pretty rare for that to be the case ;).
---
I too remember 8900 players.
---
It will settle, just add people to friends list if you feel like theres a connection.
---
You’ll get kicked out of character screen in 30 min
---
The highest pop servers in vanilla were around 4K active players.
---
Just the sub
---
Yes.  I'm wondering if I should travel now at level 6 to do quests to get a boost of rep.
---
yes. and the stupid thing is that we dont have an alternative. we are a group of 35 people. some of us only speak german. we wanna stay together as a guild, we planned this for months. all of us expected a long queue. but getting kicked after waiting for 6 hours is just an abysmal experience.
---
Same, everyone ive spoken to has moved servers last minute as well. Hoping day 2 will be better
---
hahaha
---
I'm guessing English isn't your first language, ill try explain it again.
---
They lock the ability to create new characters once a realm is full. Open more servers, lock when full. This stops realms from being over populated and prevents massive queue times. Once the rush is over and numbers are stabilised the lock is removed.
---
This way, if a friend or guild mate didn't get in before lock. They can wait a few days or everyone can move to a low pop server. This happened 10+ years ago and should of happened in the build up to classic going live.
---
Its been poorly managed by blizzard.
---
Solid advice, I'll keep that in mind!
---
What’s not working? Ahk can pretty much fix anything
---
There's a RP PVP one
---
They can play on whatever realm for now and then move back to German realm once things calm down.
---
Opening too many realms would be stupid, you'd send up merging them anyway
---
This \^
---
Shit I forgot to use /s. I was joking.
---
No changes!
---
The realm queues feel like being pounded by a brick in the face
---
Just by how you are speaking you have proven my point.  You think this is like easy mode after TBC?.  You clearly do not know understand the effort it takes to prepare to even enter MC raid.
---
Wow
---
not gonna lie, i expected you to die because it'S calssic and everything is harder :P
---
wholesome story
---
howlong can you stay AFK without getting kicked btw?
---
I'm currently playing a Druid and when I cast spells they reset for no reason, even the first when the enemy hasnt see me or attack. I'm basically using 2 casts to hit 1. It doesnt consume mana fortunately 
---
Anyone has an idea why is this happening?

Wait for the weekend when everyone and their mother will try to play wow in 4(!) german servers.
---
I don't get it. For the example, isn't is possible to let 20.000 people play on 400 copies? Please explain.
---
The earliest I expect a world first will be late Sunday night or early Monday morning. 
---
Realistically I think multiple guilds will get him down between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.
---
There's no way he won't be killed before next Thursday. By next weekend he will have been killed on most servers.
---
We only got the new server after Classic had already launched. Not exactly optimal.
---
you are also playing, you are also like me.
---
Ended up waiting a little over five hours to get in. Logged in at 6:01, got to play at 11.10. Once I was in though, it was smooth sailing. There was a shit load of people though. Only got to hit level 5 before I had to log off. Hopefully tonight is better.
---
uh huh.... i'm in one of the bigger guilds on Herod lmfao. level 20 and counting atm.
---
Imagine thinking ones entire existence is on reddit.  Although with you living in your parents basement, yours might actually be you sad mother fucker.
---
aye Im waiting a week as well ,but will.still go around gathering and doing all kinds of side stuff instead of just rushing to max lvl.
---
Why does he always look like he's brain dead?
---
Except this is exactly what happens at theme parks too.  A brand new attraction will have three to four hour waits for the first few months of its opening.
---
I have had the exact opposite experience on Gehennas EU (ally side). People are so nice and cooperative.
---
&gt;girlfriend
---
You weren't cut out for Classic anyway
---
I love seeing this, the community of Classic is something else
---
ah yes, the normie that joined last week wants people to leave.
---
If you have to take a dump it's easier and faster to do it on your pants but I doubt anybody thinks that's a good idea
---
It’s weird. I was first in on my server with no queue and when I got hit by the massive server dc the game put me in queue at place 9000 then one second later I connected. I assumed they left in a small caching window to reconnect. Guess I was just lucky.
---
Or Blizzard could Create appropriate amount of pvp serves from the start
---
Frankly i'm disappointed as fuck in Blizzard's shortsight.
---
13 years in the business, half a dozen launches and you still can't get your shit together.
---
Don't tell me you were surprised by the hype and nostalgic feeling a wow classic relaunch would create, that could have been seen from the fucking moon.
---
Yes.  I believe its 10% off when you're honored rep.  I think its 20g for riding, and 80g for mount?  I feel like the rep i gain from questing is more valuable.
---
If you play on firemaw you spend 5 hours + in queue, play for 30 minutes, randomly DC and lose your spot.
---
Or when you see 10 dead boars in Westfall, and it says the corpse needs to be looted 😡
---
And warrior is the slowest and most difficult class to level up with, the opposute of hunter. That said, warriors at 60 are monsters
---
It's not a race... Please don't get it. Play for fun.. WoW is a marathon, not a sprint!
---
I've been watching Asmon on my second monitor and they said the server caps have been increased, not sure what source they had but the queues are considerably shorter or non-existent, either everyone is sleeping or they did actually increase the cap, not 100% sure.
---
Fireman was low-medium when we moved there because Blizzard asked us to leave the high pop servers. It now has a 6-7 hour queue.
---
I know it's not the queue or anything, but it has to be a bug related to it though. I never have this only when I start WoW Classic.
---
During SWtOR launch I put a dice on the "turn" key and a book resting on it to push it down. Worked great, probably not legal!
---
this is absolute pocket change
---
its in blizzards interest for people to stay engaged and keep playing to keep subbing
---
its against their interests then for u to be stuck in a queue cuz then u give up and there is no money 
---
_____________
---
Hazzikostas: We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
That's why we're not jumping to, hey, let's just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn't about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering.
---
But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That's tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
Nope mine worked almost perfect.
---
Lol, everyone who complains about asmonbald is literally a bigger loser than he is. At least he’s funny sometimes, you guys are just tired and boring. It’s sad really.
---
Norway here. Firemaw and that other one is full.
---
Has any other english/scandinavians talked about going to a low/medium sized server?
---
Around 6-7k
---
Level 19
---
Lmao you don't even know to use wowhead most of the time. Just skim through the quest objective but that's obviously too complicated for the average retail player
---
You can only do it with 5 people parties
---
Intented to play on pve from the beginning. Not into wpvp, hate ganks, like to play calmly and enjoy the world and pve content. Nice coincidence that Russia pvp server is full and only pve server - medium.
---
Did you have any luck mining gems from copper nodes? I mined over 20 copper nodes and didn't get 1 malachite or shadowgem..
---
But that compromises zone design as well. Designing a flying friendly zone is different from targeting ground mounts. 
---
Also, I prefer ground mounts to flyers but don't want to gimp myself. I'm not sure of a better solution in terms of keeping everyone happy,  I'd like to see flying tied to war mode as flying ruins world pvp anyway.  But that would make many people furious.
---
Nope. You use remote desktop app on your phone to queue up on you home PC. You should be able to play right as you get home :)

---
Why not just switch server?
---
Is that when they could dodge every attack? I remember playing like 10 years ago, playing the capture the flag game mode and not being able to hit a level 10 human paladin
---
So allowing people to plan their servers, so that communities can stick together, didn't really matter when Blizz refuses to increases the server sizes (by increasing amount of layers).  
---
People really want to play with their friends, and in a 15 year old game many people have A LOT of friends, that each have their own mini-community. Naturally, these communities have communicated together, trying to pick a server where they can play together, so that people don't have to see their friends spread around on every different server.  
---
Not having foreseen that is just amazing.  
---
  
---
I've been playing on every single launch day except for the original one, and this is the biggest \*\*\*\*-fest I've ever witnessed, solely owing to the fact that neither me, nor any of my friends, have any idea of when we will be able to know for sure which server we will actually end up playing on.  
---
A lot of people would rather do the waiting game, to ensure that they stay on the server with most of their friends, hoping that all the mini-communities they are a part of don't have to split up.  
---
The people who are impatient, and want to play right now, will swap to the few low servers there are, and this will split up the communities, except for those that have the majority decide to stick around and wait.  
---
It's a huge dumpster of a launch.
---
mine actually work, do you have last version ?
---
I think this is now a pointless conversation. You fail to understand simple English and clearly did not play this game first time round as the lock method would make complete sense.
---
definitely, and very specific for a very small subset of players to begin with
---
8 huntard
---
You won’t. I’m on a “low pop” and could barely tag a mob this morning. 2019 low is 2005 high
---
I had a decent name in firemaw but fuck the 15000 queues, I’m playing on a low pop realm and there’s loads of chat constantly
---
The amount of wolf bodies was insane
---
&gt; Change server or be ready to be disappointed several times over the next few days/weeks.
---
Problem is, if you join a quiet server now, and it risks being empty in a months time, and then you lose your character names in a server merge, or have to wait for paid realm transfers
---
Everyone knew. So dont act stupid by pretending you thought launch will be seamless. Even though the figurative launch date was today, and I'll try to play today, the actual launch date that I consider will be September 5 or something. This was to be expected. Being outraged about this is being retarded about this.
---
Theirs realms that don’t even have que times y’all just choose to play in high pop
---
I know, I have that dropdown menu there. But he has not
---
I got level 5 on Kirtonos
---
Most NA people are asleep/getting ready for work.
---
LoL
---
I was quite lucky. Chose realm 25mins before live (30 min timeout on that). No queue. Straight in with a slight pause on final 5% of loading bar.
---
Questing, my timing was lucky too. Logged out after an hour, out of start zone so I could sleep for work today.
---
We'll see how queues are in the evening.
---
I suppose someone had to be lucky, and someone not. Just the way it goes.
---
Go to the tauren starting area asap, and do all quests tied to thunderbluff rep while they are between red and green to get the maximum amount of rep. Continue doing this while leveling, and turn in cloth when youre out of quests.
---
Disagree. 
---
If you are sick and weak and do physical labour, relaxing behind a computer is much easier to do. (Should be sleeping though)
---
Bless
---
The only way this launch could have been worse is if the servers crashed and no one got to play
---
It's a joke not a dick no need to take it so hard.
---
Just ride it out and do a paid transfer later
---
12 year olds aren't playing this game haha

Oceanic player here who got 12 before Arugal shit the bed.  Took the day off but still had a couple hour wait from 0700 when the server opened.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones!

I logged in early and never sat in a queue. I leveled to 9 on Skeram with no issues whatsoever.
---
Warlock warlock?

I'm playing on Gandling EU and it's smooth as butter l. Occasionally a crash but nothing major
---
No, the game runs on 1.13, which is based on 1.12. Differences are mostly in loot tables and what content is available. See https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346

They added 5 more on the fly.

If the queue depth remains ridiculous over the next few days I expect a few more to be added.

It's not live, the article was just a snapshot from last night.

Nope, no chance that its Classic dude. Do some more troubleshooting.

AOT-what for Anto-who?

Golemagg has 13k people in queue right now
---
Your "solution" from above is exactly what we have now. Wait a few days or go to low pop now. You solved nothing. You're not making any sense.
---
Meanwhile in Mulgore, it was just groups of 5 spamming abilities to tag Chief Sharptusk. Taurens. The true savages. The true Horde!

Yeah Blizz has absolutely no clue what they are doing. Shazzrah(one of the most populated server on EU) was Full before. Now it's "only" high pop with 10k queue LOL. Peopl could create new toons on Shazzrah all morning.
---
6 lvl, get on the train to stormwind and dc-ed. Thought it was a sign and went to sleep, which was nice since I got to work early and can leave early
---
Lucifron German
---
- 16k-18k Queues
---
- You get kicked like 20mins after you went through a 5hrs Queue
---
I logged in right at 0001, then got disconnected at 0110 and was in Queue for like 5hrs. Then I played 30mins and the Servers went down for an hour. Then I played 1-2 more hours and my whole Guild got DCed again and since then we are stuck in a Queue up to 20.000 Players. After another 5hrs Queue me and most of my Guild came back online - played 10-30mins and then got DC'ed again. Back to the 16K Queue.
---
Right now we almost all gave up and hope we get a new German PvP Server.
---
Both of our PvP Servers are full. One 18K Queue, the other 9-11K Queue.
---
Why are you so upset over this?
---
I dont. But ya know, to get the lastesr wersion i need to relog. Aint happening.
---
But thanks for letting me know tho
---
The problem with mobile games; is that out of 10281510 worthless copies of the more popular ones there's only 1 or 2 that sticks out. Sure they are free. Sure they need money to maintain them but when I need an example I always point out Marvel Strike Force.  
---
Amazing mobile game. Not like that bull Raid shadow legends. Sure it's a copy of any build a team break s up. But as a F2P you can be at worst 2-3 months behind whales. The huge downside to it is that all the "offers" are predatory as fuck and very pay to win (Stay in the top 100). You can reach the 100-250 easy while being free by laser focusing stuff. You need a guide if you are new but it's definitely possible. But I wouldn't treat that game as a game for whole. Just a really away from pc/console game that I can play while I'm doing x other stuff.   
---
As much as games itself are time killers, mobile games takes the cake. They aren't the type of game you sit down and go heavy 4-8hour gameplay on it and be like yeahhh progress, immersion etc. Only 1-2 games on mobile can achieve this and 90% of the time they are ports.
---
got to 5 went to IF learned skinning, went out of IF - not DC'ed but no NPC in the area, two other player "froze" on the border to the city and everytime i walk to kargath it says: "instance not found" and ports me back to IF... went so smooth until IF :(
---
I find that very hard to believe.
---
EU times are waaaaaay off
---
I'm still playing lvl21 3/4 of the way to lvl22  orc warlock
---
Baby is dead but at least you know your position in the queue.
---
Imagine being proud of yourself for not watching a streamer
---
They probably think a lot of players will drop.
---
It was good, it wasn't best. It did however have the best raid, ulduar. Ulduar was absolutely amazing through and through.
---
Werewolf Druid was always my go-to. Loved the speed and rapidly slapping things for HP.
---
Now they are alMost 27.5 , impressive
---
Well yes, designing a zone for flying of course has to take in more option than just ground. But I don't feel that the zone design in the latest expansion suffered from that. IMHO the design and feel of the zones is one thing they continually are very good at. Especially since you spend a lot of time in the new zones before you get to fly in it.
---
League - 1,5 million
---
CS and Dota - both 1,3 million
---
Calm your fat tits. It wasnt in the ama. It was a blue post on forums, a clearly worded tidbit in one of the new realm announcements. I dont care enough to bother looking for it, find it yourself.
---
Those are valid concerns, unfortunately there's no way to tell other than wait and see.
---
Try Anydesk.
---
You can do that, I've done this earlier. Grace period works if you quickly reconnects it's just random crash that put you back into queue.
---
I set up a macro that clicks “create new character” and “back” every 5 minutes
---
Get Autohotkey and a simple script that turns your character, that's what I've been doing all night when I wanna eat or have a smoke.
---
You clearly have no idea how little vanilla raids require from players. At day 4 there will be first level 60. It only depends on which day they will have enough attuned people and that's it. 
---
BWL will get cleared 3 hours after release despite attunement. KT will be down after 2 hours after being added to the game. People were speedclearing naxx in 1hr20minutes on private servers despite they were much harder than they are on classic. Content won't last long, get over it.
---
That’s what I read in another thread.
---
I’m sure it already did but at least I saved time in a video game! Lol.
---
Golemagg queue has always been long , currently 13k
---
only 2936, try 16789
---
Same problem here. we moved to stalagg when they told us other were full. ~70 of us are ready to go for yesterday, and they expect us to what, log in at work to get our names on a new server they waited way too long to release?

Paid transfers are coming, so transfer once it’s available
---
I was around this age when I played vanilla, so I guest some of them now will be playing on classic
---
Retail WoW is friendlier to beginners. But if you really want to start with Classic, there is plenty of information and guides about it. When I first started I mostly just went with the flow and asked other players about quests and such.
---
is reading quest text such a chore for these ppl?
---
11 on my main, 6 on the one my husband and I play, 3 on two others debating which I wanted to play first.
---
4 bags?? Look at this baller over here. I only have one, and had to have a guildie make it.

Dude, it’s launch day. Give it a few days to simmer down and then plan which server you want to be on.   I am just glad I could log in at all last night.

---
I don't have a lot of free time. It will take me a long time to get to 60 and even then I won't have the best gear. This means every world pvp I encounter will just be higher leveled and better geared players ganking me when I'm trying to complete a quest. Why bother?
---
This is somewhat nostalgic to look at.
---
Made that exact same mistake the first time I played.
---
Ok so tell them when their available your  now at a different realm because their lvl 1
---
Just buy one from a general goods vendor for 5 Silver.
---
MobInfo2
---
There’s no Queue rn for most servers tho
---
wholesome
---
Same on grobbulus. It was almost cinematic
---
Yea, like u/patcriss said, be careful with it, you aren't really benefiting from it too much but they might not appreciate you making the queues longer, I only use it for ~10 minutes before I'm back on my computer just to be safe
---
Do zepplins not work atm?
---
It's certainly not 2.9 seconds for the initial swing.
---
My game crashed and it literally let me right back in no queue or nothin
---
The thing for EU servers are, What streamers are you trying to avoid? We got basically no streamers :D
---
You’re completely missing the point of the post and focusing in on one word.
---
there are no eu streamer servers, thank god they're all NA and the one that could have a following (forsen) isn't gonna play classic
---
I see, thanks for the insight. Right now medium realms take ~20 minutes to enter which I'm fine with. Anything above an hour... I'll pass. I suppose it's an acquired taste for wow vets haha.
---
Probably because a ton of people aren’t going to go crazy and actually went to bed. Stalag has a 25k+ queue as soon as things went live. I was thankful I was monitoring blue posts and saw when they announced the first two new servers they were standing up and all of my friends and I were able to get into Kromcrush. Spent a while fighting the “World Server is Down” boss though...
---
I'm an Orc Rogue leveling in the Undead area. People had questions.
---
because I like playing the game, not being corpse camped by folk who enjoy griefing other players.  I love solo questing when I can play, as my play time is limited to after 7pm most nights. 
---
PVP will be there in BGs when I want to do it, or in organised world PVP.  
---
However, when I just want to quest/level away, I dont have to worry about being ganked as I am low on health fighting 1-2 mobs.
---
Had that happen to me 3 times. The last one was 20minutes after I fucking beat a 5hrs Queue! I'm so pissed you can't believe it! 
---
And I'm not alone. Its always the same people from my Guild that get disconnected together. We all logged in at the same time like an hour ago and 20min after that all DC'ed and back to a 18K Queue.
---
Great answer. This is what I’ll be doing. Thanks man.
---
They were rolled out this way because cross server groups are no longer a thing. Better to have a bunch of populated servers at launch and add server by server than release 50 servers at launch and have a bunch of low pop servers with people who can’t make groups. 
---
If you don’t like the long ques, move servers, or suck up the que times

---
Not for 2 weeks that's rediculous
---
That really says something about BFA.
---
its because of people like that that wow turned into a shit game
---
Yes but think about it this way. Technically "Full" should mean there is a queue, but then every server would say full currently. The way it is now, low, med, and high are just ways to judge the queue size. Yes it's dumb, but that's the way it is. No reason to rewrite a bunch of code to fix something on the server screen just for a large influx of players that will die down after a bit of time.
---
Smart move, pacing yourself is important.
---
This doesn't say anything about the community.
---
You’re a loser.
---
Was ready for the game on first wave into Heord.... mistakes 
---
Got 1 kill and logged off. Was laggy, sooo many people and everyone needed kills.
---
Decided to give it time and come back once the first area is died out a little. I'm in no real rush.
---
I dunno I got called a b*tch for hitting a lazy peon faster than someone lol. But yea people are definitely in higher spirits now that classic is here lots of joking around and enthusiasm.
---
Tankenstein - UD warrior
---
That's better than some!
---
did you /who stormwind? The capitals in general are just quite empty - no one has any reason to be in there.
---
Pitbull users: any way to hide unit frames under certain conditions? I don't want to see mine unless I'm in combat or under 100%hp. I tooled around for a while and couldn't find any settings like that.
---
Can confirm, have been doing that for the last 7 hours. Already at 128 skinning :D
---
As somebody who’s playing the game for the first time and doesn’t have any friends that play WoW this scares me lol.
---
I get lost between the starter tree and the 2 towns in the forest
---
But i got this potato thingie, cant i use it instead to capture my screen? :(
---
What time?  My experience was right at launch, 6-7 on EST.
---
Owned
---
Yeah I'm probably gonna do the same for most stuff. Was just more like a test to see if anyone buys. I did sell a green dagger for 3 silver to a vendor though, I doubt anyone pays 5 or more silver for a level 6 green dagger right now.
---
No. FBI, open up!
---
Is the queues mostly for PvP servers or a US thing? Or am I just doomed when they're actually open in primetime in Europe 🥺
---
Well then they shouldn't be putting him on stage to do presentations in front of thousands of fans.
---
work with it not against it, you can shift loot, window opens then you can move on assuming you have free space in bags
---
I think the real problem is that people don't know they can use reddit on a computer. So of course they have to take a picture with a phone, because that's where they post things on reddit.
---
Loktar Ogar friend!!
---
I'm like more than halfway to one gold, and I could buy all the bags, but nope, not till I at least get close to 2 gold.
---
All servers have queues at night bro. I tried 7.
---
Actually i do have an understanding, this game at one point had millions of players. They knew this was going to happen, they only made enough servers to still all be full of insane wait times. The lag, while annoying isnt really the big problem, the 6-7 hour queue times are a big problem, especially when they told us all to move from server to server so this WOULDNT happen. But it still did. Niice.
---
What gives you that idea?
---
played for 2-2.5hrs and got to level 7. had work today, so needed sleep.
---
bro 😎💪
---
I got to play after 2.5h queue then got a power cut after 2h playing. Been queueing the rest of the day. Fun part is that I couldn't sleep because it was 3pm when I got to re-queue. Now it's almost midnight. I have 3k people ahead of me and 2h until scheduled maintenance.
---
I have no idea why people don't skip quests like that. I skipped all the annoying Quests in Northshire. I got Hogger because I solo tagged him vs like 15 other people and solo killed him as Warlock while the others wanted me to die.
---
Ssssh don't tell anyone lol.
---
I'm on right now
---
Ok send me "three fiddy"
---
I've taken poops longer than it takes to get from 1-10
---
By soon, you mean you’ll log in now and be able to create your toon in a mere 10 hours later? Wonderful!
---
&gt; didn't really matter when Blizz refuses to increases the server sizes (by increasing amount of layers).
---
That’s not what layering is though. It’s really just a less invasive form of sharding. That doesn’t increase the cap on server size. Just tries to help smooth over the impact of the large amounts of people in the same area.
---
Can't you simply launch the game with the executable instead of doing if through bnet's launcher ?
---

Gaming used to be a mens domain. I'm not saying that's how it should be or is today but that's a fact. Even today the majority of gamers are male (I don't count stuff like bejeweled as 'gaming' /gatekeeping)
---
It's not outworldly even if a bit outdated to assume that ken on average would be nore understanding of someone nerding away, it's not an attack on all women and you are too easily triggered by meaningless shit.
---
This moment right here when the servers first came up was the real classic wow experience.
---
Then layering happened. And just my personal opinion, so thankful for layering.
---
Hunter and Warlock share the ease of having a pet. They will have no problem with questing and survive in the open world.
---
Pro Hunter:
---
- Hunter is a bit faster and easier to level
---
- Cool pets (you can tame)
---
- Low skill floor but high skill ceiling
---
- Easy in PvP
---
- Great solo farming
---
- Early movement boost
---
Cons Hunter:
---
- PvE (raid) you don't need as many
---
- don't scale that hard with gear as a warlock 
---
- Great for solo playing less support for teams
---
Pro Warlock:
---
- Great looking Tier Sets
---
- Good item scaling
---
- Free Mount at 40
---
- Cool Utilties: Soulestone, Healthstone &amp; Banish
---
- 
---
Cons Warlock:
---
- Boring PvE rotation (spaming one button)
---
- Shard Farming
---
- No movement speed boost
---
- Feeling more like a turrent
---
All ya gotta do is click one and hit disable! Annoys me so much!
---
It's literally just the big servers having the issue.  You know... the same ones everyone including blizzard warned you about that people brushed off.  I mean, who could possibly have a queue when layering exists... *Eye roll*
---
I listened to Hawthorne heights almost exclusively while grinding my warrior in vanilla
---
Are you daft or something?
---
Which part of "they fucked up the server architecture, have to enhance it to the detriment of the playerbase because  theplayers already made arrangements regarding server+faction with 100's of persons and most likely won't split" don't you understand?
---
Dont worry, you wont be able to
---
Sounds like you don't have a world of warcraft subscription.
---
Assuming the queues last like this for a week... do you think blizzard should have purchased the infrastructure to handle a weeks worth of long queue time? It’s like buying an expensive wedding dress. Yeah it will go great on its debut but after that what’s the point?
---
I went to buy game time in the form of 30 day game time card and all 3 stores I went to were sold out, so I bought one of those $50 visa credit cards, saved right? Nope, when I got home I found out the card says in fine print "Funds not available for 24 hours." so now I sit in my own personal 24 hour hell queue... :)
---
 Watch out folks, we've got an altoholic over here.
---
Aye but still, logically thinking here.... there are always issues with games at release like this one, therefore without reading ANYTHING on forums etc it would be sensible to think ahead and book time off after the initial rush to avoid overcrowded starting areas, lag, queues, etc..

 For us on Rattlegore it was completely backwards, noobs would ask if this was where a quest mob spawned and we would all say no . :D
---
Broke asf rn but I agree. I'm only going to binge because I'm unemployed so while I look for work I'll play. That's why I bought game time too. If I had a job you wouldn't catch me on my PC. I'd be out meeting girls or doing something weird.
---
if you dont care to source what you say then shut the fuck up
---
I remember coming from FFXI and being blown away that you did quests for XP.  Hope casual is that?  In my day, you spent an hour or two in that trying to form a group, then you went out and killed crabs, crawlers, or birds for 30 minutes before your healer has to leave.
---
crashing entire layers to force the queue to move is my guess, they're getting desperate. There was / is definetely a grace period but when this happens there is suddenly no grace period to login without queue.
---
If you level up a healing class you go with the dps spec - feral, ret, enhance, shadow. You can handle the healing in dungeons with no problem if you know what you're doing.
---
Wish I could upvote this more than once!
---
The pop says it's not full, but the line is 4000 for me and i waited 7hours
---
&gt;It's better to make many servers then merge later if there were issues.
---
When the servers merge and people get together. A lot of them would need to change their names. Who's gonna lose their names? Why one over the other?
---
Thank god for the yeti cave in Dun Murogh
---
Adding server by server almost completely removes the possibility that pre-planned large guilds will switch to the new realms. Their inclination of how long queue times would be was pretty spot on which means there’s no reason they couldn’t have added those 14 sooner.
---
Please choose other new servers like noggenfogger,or ull have to wait 10k queues
---
Got in the second the servers went live. Grobbulus starting zones were a shit show. The high latency made it impossible for casting spells or even tagging mobs. Decided to restart the game and got put in a queue of 3 hours. 
---
Called it a night.
---
same, all of our guild guys either dced 3 times or 0 times, 40 people, looks really random, like the random 2 legendary drops vs 0 legendary drops in legion
---
People trying to sell linen bags for 10s on Baumeux 3 hours after launch lol
---
No?
---
No. People were speculating that but it was never announced.
---
No, they didn't.
---
Level 10 is nothing, you will be level 10 again before they implement transfers if they even do it
---
Heh. Just made 20 or so bags and sent a group message to friends about it. Seconds later I had "volunteers" to take the bags off of me.
---
I feel bad
---
[https://imgur.com/a/4fu9Y2c](https://imgur.com/a/4fu9Y2c)
---
1hr in and got 3, 6slots bag drop
---
Unfortunately, these aren't live estimates. Date &amp; time updated are on the page.
---
I eventually did. I tried a few spawns and came back when it wasn’t as bad actually. One or two I just gave up. Fighting for mobs wasn’t horrible but one mob was just torture
---
I skipped all these quests, not worth it in on a launch, makes no difference you can just grind 10 boars instead to make up the exp difference.
---
6.5. I had a 4k queue at 1130, so I expected to not be able to play since I usually go to bed for work at 12 latest. Somehow a ton of people crashed at once and I got in right before going to bed. I also figured I wasn't getting in, so I got realllly high since I planned on going to bed anyways. Next thing I know it was 1:45 lol

Description:

Didn't seem to read my post or my README, where I detailed how I'm concerned about this very problem, where talked about the precautions that I've taken to prevent that sort of behavior and how I have more things planned for preventing it, nor did this person pay attention to how I explicitly stated that I am interested in talking with the community for their ideas on how to do better.
---
Would not recommend.
---
You would think people who sub for name reservation cares if they have to change?
---
That’s 100% why. Even saw a few taurens in Durotar
---
which server was that? I logged in at 5:02 and got in at 9 :(
---
I had this last night.  Reinstalling the battle net client fixed it for me.
---
just realized i actually haven't been able to play the game yet, sat in queue for 5 hours after launch last night and never got in, slept til now and NOW THERES A BIGGER QUEUE.
---
im on EU btw, my friends all wanted to play on Gehennas for some reason even though it was full even during name select phase.
---
Are combo points supposed to drop if add a point to a target, target myself and then target the enemy again? im looking at patch notes and it was fixed in 1.4 but we're at 1.12(right?) and it doesn't seem to work that way?
---
I don't know how he can recover from this.
---
I knew I wouldn’t have to scroll far to find some hate for Asmon. Wow reddit has a weird hate boner and keep projecting their own insecurities on to him.
---
That’s why I logged onto Kromcrush instead
---
My ring finger feels this pain today lol
---
Was wondering the same thing
---
I mean, you called him a literal god, don’t you think that’s a bit much?  If you like the guy that’s fine, but it seems his fans get defensive over anyone who dares question his popularity.
---
And I prefer it that way. Questing is abouth adventure and looking for something. When eventually the first addons put quest areas and markers on the map (even with "auto travel" to the destinatio), the adventure was gone, just busy work left.
---
Makes sense
---
Yeah I will play alliance on my main server and horde on this one. decides to main the priest for now
---
Not really if you complete elite and/or high level quests in a group. It's actually easier for healers in that regard, because your job is to keep others alive, while they will struggle to beat the mob because their attacks will miss a lot if the mob's level is above yours.
---
My guild ended up grouping up and just ground mobs ahead of the pack, left Northshire Abbey almost immediately.
---
1.2 mil as far as I know.
---
Fairbanks
---
He sure did sound like it.  The flailing tantrum in the background was also pretty hilarious.
---
It costs money to run, but people have to understand that it doesn't cost 15 euro PER PERSON to run. Probably closer to like 2.5 euro per person or whatever. Even that might be generous. I understand they need to make a profit to bother at all, but is it fair for them to make THAT MUCH of a profit when they can't even handle a fucking RE-RELEASE?
---

Wow, your brother has a rtarded brother
---
Elvui classic is pretty decent
---
it is the middle of the day, what did you expect?
---
Exactly the answer I was looking for. Thanks.
---
/s
---
What???
---
streamers happened
---
I’m happy. Only had 2 hours to play after waiting in the queue for 3 hours. Got to level 9 :)
---
I checked the healbot site, googled it, checked the wiki and all in-game commands. I cannot find anything about it.
---
Low pop= high pop server back in the day. Blizz will probably add paid character transfer so you could always switch if it gets waaay too low, which I doubt
---
Tried to log into Golemagg at 4:30 this morning to play an hour before work and the queue was at 5k. On my way home now guessing it's gonna be alot worse.
---
In A Storm of Swords he grabs Alliser Thorne by the throat and lifts him clear off the ground, when he was just sixteen.
---
The guy's got retard strength.
---
So I guess old IF is still there too. There a staircase that lets you initiate a duel in the city, that might be patched.
---
Bc/Wotlk had boomkins and other specs be viable. I loved playing oomkin in vanilla, but the wpvp in BC and WotlK was more fun
---
All the phone photos wtf is going on
---
Damn dude. I woke up at 5am for work so I went to bed at 9:30pm lol. I got level 8 before needing to go. Really wanted to get dual wield and talents :(
---
I hit that first 1 hr queue and my wife says “we should eat before you play” so we left. Came back to an 8 hr queue and laughed. My wife was like “you ain’t mad?” I said no that this is what it was in classic lol
---
I eventually went to a new server to scratch the itch and got a better toon with a better name! I’m gonna try going back to the other server later since I’m kinda invested in it.
---
GrobMob! Or maybe that new RP-PVP deviate delight - we’ll see which queue is less
---
Sigh.... You guys are dumb.

---
Genius
---
Its 5am
---
Realistically theres no low pop severs atm, they're all gonna fill up, and I think blizzard with either merge or offer xfers off severs that die
---
That's kind of a double edged sword. Not knowing where to go, getting lost and finding your way is often the most rewarding part of playing the game.
---
Wear the man's skin
---
Not worth it unless you have friends playing. Theres more than enough players even on low pop servers
---
Or there are relatively few players who took time off work for this?
---
Oh, I guess it makes sense that the "total realm pop" and "total pop allowed online at any one time" numbers would be different. 
---
You mean if the realm population is 8000/10 000 but the total allowed online is 5000 at once, this is what happens, right?
---
I think they care more about being on a dead in the ditch server.
---
Except we couldn't... I tried to sign on to retail in the middle of the ridiculous queue, and all it did was disconnect me from classic. 
---
I can buy that launch was choppy, but the lack of communication is frustrating. There shouldn't be queue on medium realms...
---
Isn’t it based on the number of created characters on the realm?
---
I assume this is a glitch because many of them still have a queue.
---
*scribbling into notebook: leave a book or other cheap personal item too*
---
just kidding though, i am not sure, i haven't done it myself
---
i don't care enough about a place at a pool to wake up far earlier than i am used to...and it'S a dick move anyways ;)
---
I have heard it really being a problem with mostly germans doing it, which is weird but somehow it's the clichee that i have heard about even in german "news"
---
Why did I not think of this...?  I can get an hour or so of queue time out of the way like this. \^\^
---
I don’t actually know how blizzard does their patch notes, but I read 1.4 as 1.40, which would come later in my mind than 1.12.  But like I said, I don’t know anything so thanks for reading this useless bit of input.
---
How are queues in EU at the moment?
---
Makes sense. And will be awesome to get home today and not worry about a queue. My server never had a horrible one though, so this might just straight up eliminate it.
---
Any tips for enchanting? Just get greens?
---
As far as I know a macro for changing a complete set of gear needs to refer to particular bag-slots and would be rather lengthy and difficult to write.
---
If no such addon exists and works, I'll have to find another way but I would assume it exists and I'm just not aware of it.
---
Fair enough, I guess they discontinued the package?
---
I guess that's okay for you, but I really don't think data caps should be a thing. Google Fibre seems to be the only good ISP in the US. Shame they're stopping installation. 
---
Asynchronous 1Gbps with no datacaps. I'm not aware of any other US ISP's that offer this.
---
did u show up in a god forsaken graveyard in the middle of nowhere for the True Classic experience?

Looking forward to Half-Life 2, apparently from that beta leak it will be fantastic!

Because ur most likely on a different layer. Rip

Yea i have auto loot on and the window opens and closes so fast I dont even see what I got
---
Alliance on Stalagg did the same thing
---
I played wod release. This is worse.
---
What’s ping?
---
Warrior dps is one of the best damage dealer.
---
Is that why I keep getting an error about not having active game time?
---
And is that supposed to be a problem? You can stop after the first few times, or by then you have found a stable group of friends to do these things with so you don't have to spend all that time over again.
---
Just start over on another server...

---
Nice strawman, too bad this is not the wizard of oz.
---
I've seen them mention it multiple times on the WoW forums, but here's one of the more recent times they've mentioned it:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/medium-pop-still-has-login-queue/271551/19
---
Basically, as I mentioned, their current plan is to try to not open up too many servers to prevent there from being dead realms in the first place.  Their goal is to have the balance to where each realm is healthy and alive, even after the first few months where you will likely see some of the population drop off.  This is why we are seeing such long queues.  Each server yesterday evening had a queue at multiple points, and some of the queues were insanely high.  It's obviously frustrating, especially when a lot of people had already picked a server to play on with friends, but if you have the flexibility to hop onto another server and settle there, then at this point, you shouldn't have to worry too much about the realm dying.  If Blizzard had opened up twice as many servers as they have currently opened from the beginning, then the realms dying would be a legitimate concern that I would have.  At this point though, it appears to me that although the queues suck, they are direct reflections of the fact that Blizzard's plan to make all of the realms have a healthy population for the foreseeable future is likely working.
---
That being said, if for some reason a huge majority of the playerbase dropped off, then Blizzard has said that they'd be willing to offer free realm transfers if it came down to it.  I personally don't think that will end up being necessary, as pretty much all of the realms had a queue, and I think someone added them all up at one point last night and the number of people waiting in queues was around 300k just for North America.  I think that if more people start realizing this and just going with some of the Low/Medium population realms that everything will more so even out and all of the servers will be healthy.  
---
Also, I'm not sure if you read the Blizzard forums, but they mentioned that the population size is based on an algorithm that gives them a size relative to the other servers.  That's why we were seeing servers that said the population was "Low" but still had queues.  They said that they are considering changing the algorithm to show the population as being full if there is a queue (because obviously, the server is full at that point).
---
All in all, you have to make the right decision for yourself, but because of those reasons, I really think the servers that currently exist will be fine if everyone starts spreading out between all of them.  I'd be fine with there being a small queue on each server if it means that they will all be healthy in a month or two.
---
One of the main reasons I am running a priest this time around. I LOVED getting Stamina buffed when leveling on a private server, so its time to give back to the people
---
download questie addon and let shit work for you :)

Warrior is a beast once geared up.  Rogue best annoying griefer
---
This creatures very nature offends me.
---
Oh boy someone needs a timeout.

In a hurry atm but are add-ons allowed still? If so, where? Haven't played since 2011

Yeah a hotspot will be fine for questing and dungeons. Might be pushing it once your get j to a 40 man raid.

yes.

no one expects you to be prot spec while leveling. every below level 50 is Arms/Fury.
---
and you tank them just fine.
---
Played 0min and in queue still. Good for you
---
Well now I’m concerned for the newest ones they opened last night. Unless they all kinda leveled out. Which is bad for everyone.
---
The funniest moment I had last night was a dwarf priest giving out fortitude that went oom after buffing one guy
---
I do really love it though. I tried to give out arcane intellect to anyone I thought needed it and trading buffs with passersby for two hours was honestly the biggest sense of community I've felt in WoW since pandaria.
---
I believe the prompt is when your in the window   /z *Insert name of Zone*.  I may be wrong and you may just be able to type in the name of a zone and it’ll pull it up. Also if you do a /who search on a Guild it will show all online members at the time of the search
---
Nice. I couldn't get on at all last night and now I'm sitting here at work.
---
World first! Nice
---
No matter what blizz could have done...Everybody who has ever been in blizzard launches of exp and games back in the day already expected this..  
---
This is just normal ... The way servers are, they just cant handle this amount of traffic.. we just have to deal with it..  
---
Now if you are already quitting for not being able to play for 2-3 days you have no clue what lies ahead of you in terms of lvling times and grind needed at max lvl ...
---
omg
---
thats awful
---
Well, that's perfect then, because Whelp is sharing your reviews with your friends and guildmates!  There's no central repository of reviews.  I don't even think that could exist, if I wanted it to (due to restrictions from on Blizzard's API).  But I don't _want_ a central repository to exist.  I don't want people being judged by random other people's ratings.  I want people to get information about other players only from sources they trust (i.e. friends and guildmates).
---
It's this. The population is related to current active players.
---
Right before launch every server was either High or Full (with the exception of a few PvE servers that were medium).
---
After I logged off at like midnight most had dropped to medium due to people going to sleep and not playing.
---
dunno bro, like 10% of my friend list its on BFA and really dont like classic, but those who stayed on the BFA are the HARDCORE fans, the ones u cant complain about anything in modern wow.
---
That's a good question
---
PvE : Weenie Hut Jr’s
---
PvP : The Salty’s Spitoon
---
Mograine is the one! Lots of English speaking people levelling last night and the closest to 50:50 according to reddit.
---
This is bullshit, have you actually done it or just parroting other people who haven't leveled a priest in vanilla? Priest are high tier 2 levelers. Extremely solid, chain killing mobs, decent kill time, no downtime at all, full hp/Mana after every kill. 
---
You don't go shadow before 40, you go spirit tap, wand spec, then dps talents in holy. Respec at 40 for shadowform, proceed to melt face.
---
Wife is logging me in at 3pm UK time so I should be able to play not long after I get home

One is the full experience, the other is missing out on half the game.

This makes me so happy to read. Congrats to you and all of us :)
---
theres not enough damn money in this game
---
If your American this is a holiday weekend so you're probably screwed with that plan
---
Indeed.  I never liked healbot, could never figure out how to make the panels match actual group arrangements.  Vuhdo in my opinion is the superior click-to-cast mod.
---
Blizzard is right a lot of people would drop out quick. Cuz blizzard won’t let them play the fucking game. This is why no one wants to give them a chance anymore I’m starting to not blame them.
---
Weird, I was on Skeram and the DC didnt hit me
---
Does anyone have any links to add-ons that work? I tried downloading Questie and TotalRP classic editions but they don't seem to work.
---
Bannable offense. The game knows you're using software to operate the game. Botting bans don't happen immediately, Blizzard collects data and acts on it manually. Don't be surprised when you get banned within the next few weeks.
---
I never sat in a que. I was having ridiculously bad lag on the server.
---
is not streamers fault all big streamers are in 1 server Faerlina, because they know they can ruin servers
---
Found the guy who started with legion.

10 hours in elwynn forest so far

I sold my 6 slot bags for 7s last night, a little more reasonable
---
BAN em all! None of them spoke english.
---
Yeah as an OSRS player I definitely disagree with him, but he's yet to be proven wrong. That'll happen when the player retention rates are shown.
---
It absolutely could have. When you're on a server and can only group with people FROM that server, your reputation actually matters.
---
Yeah I've heard some "ED on DD" stuff and the joke legit writes itself, but I just figured/hoped that the hardcore Goldshire erotica community had already targeted an RP server or something.  I never really played on ED so I really couldn't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure that the mere existence of a brothel at one or two inns would affect my experience...as long as party members aren't orgy-ing their way through 5-mans or anything...
---
Geez, one server is like half the size of a whole mmo
---
This guy fucks!
---
I know it doesn’t matter, but I was just giving away the bullets I made from engineering and a green stave I found to a priest.
---
Haven't seen or heard anything about this, what's this about?
---
I don't know why this guy annoys me so much. I never watched him but somehow I get tons of "Asmongold reacts to ..." videos from dozens of Best Of channels.
---
There is zero chance I was sitting in a queue for one server when there were medium pop servers at launch ready to go... atleast there were normal servers available
---
Let's completely ignore the fact that blizzard charge exorbitant amounts of money for WoW in general and then excuse this piss-poor service. Very consumer-minded of you.
---

---
I've tried this and it's not working.
---
I like how we've already got a meme. Fuck Labite!
---
There is no cross faction communication.. you can't even make a toon on each faction on the same server
---
The way realm population display currently works once the servers are live is that High, Medium, and Low are determined dynamically, in terms relative to the most crowded realms. So a realm with pretty rough queues (say 4k-5k) might end up showing as Medium because you aren’t Faerlina, Herod, etc.
---
This is how it’s worked for a long time, but the unprecedented size of the queues on the handful of outlier realms is skewing the algorithm. The team’s first priority is stability and getting new servers online as needed, but beyond that, we’ll look into changing this logic to be more intuitive (i.e. showing “Full” when a server has a queue, for starters). I know, this is technically not #nochanges, but then again neither are 20k people waiting to log into the same realm…

We were on the newest PvP eastern server before launch. Still 15-20k ques

For me it was dimming the screen SUPER low after I was supposed to be already in bed.. playing and if I heard the slightest noise.. turning off the monitor and sitting very still... (also did that for Runescape which I played before WoW)... later it was just doing that so they didn't know I'd stayed up till 5 am playing...

Medium pop is just how many characters have been created on there apparently.

Should I switch off a server added late last night for a more popular one to ensure longevity?
---
Put it this way, r/dedgaem is now a WoW themed subreddit.
---
I'm on 13k 183min shazzrah
---
I mean some 100k+ people spent the entire launch unable to play. Launch only went smooth if you were logged in an hour before it actually went live.
---
Lol what are you talking about,golemagg is a mess with 5k queue
---
Lol there's a million layers, you won't even see the same people tomorrow. But hey, it's cute you think this still.
---
They don't expect you to pay for a name reservation....have you all never heard of personal responsibility? I agree that they should've locked realms though, at least for launch
---
Half an hour
---
But if you have lads on friend list that are horde but added as a bnet friends then you can whisper no?
---
Everybody in Eastern Kingdoms was DC'd, across all servers. That wouldn't be a layer issue..
---
Yes, they want to trick people into playing bfa :D even though it would be for just a few seconds.
---
I played on low pop and I had no lag. Got one random disconnect during my 6 levels
---
Damn. I must have gotten super lucky last night. I logged out to install an add-on and was able to pop right back in.
---
You can probably get to level 6 faster than waiting for a 10k queue.
---
And some of you brainlets are still crying about layering lol. Imagine if there weren't layers.
---
Retail servers never change though.

Mage over lock

Yes and it will get bad again today as people log in.

I was in group with a guildmate literally 5 feet behind him on the flight path and we both got kicked at the same time. He was able to get back in instantly and I was slapped with a 5,000+ person hour and a half queue. Makes no sense.

Man I must have gotten extremely lucky with how many people I have seen struggling with bags.

At level 6 when I entered red cloud mesa I broke down and bought 1.
---
Then in the span of like 15 minutes I found 4 more. It was pretty sweet.
---
I agree.  But the idea of whitelists and blacklists isn't new at all, and was more unfair to people (IMO) than I plan for Whelp to be when it's really "done".
---
Instead of running from this idea (which isn't new, but has simply been codified in Whelp), I think we should all talk together and design a system that will help us to make good decisions about who to group with, while trying to minimize the potential for slander and abuse.
---
I swear people were falling asleep in queue ... I was sitting at 85 ppl ahead of me for over an hour
---
Managed to get into skeram last night by being logged in 30 min before servers went live. My gf logged in 10 minutes after me and ended up stuck in queue for 3 hours before giving up. I got to level 10 but am not looking forward to coming home from work tonight to a 15k+ queue.
---
To the people saying just reroll, I've already switched servers two times. I was on Heros first, then moved to Stalagg when it released as blizz said it would be a mess. Then Stalagg became full and Skeram was released so I switched there. It's kind of silly to keep switching servers when the actual problem was the lack of available

The server costs, and perhaps some employees to maintain them, is what is required for the game to function. The rest of the sub fee could be argued goes into development of future content and research etc. But you'd be a naive fool to think they aren't pocketing at least half as pure profit.

I couldn't find one person streaming BFA yesterday on twitch.  Everyone was playing classic

Lol, work.

I think they are crashing layers randomly that blizzard feels are abusing things like auto jump/move to stay online.

Lucifron. I logged in 1 1/2 hours ago with 17.000 people ahead of me in the queue. Now there are still 13.363 ahead.

Ist there a Website that monitors queue times? Found a article in wowhead but its Not up to Date.(https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294726.2/launch-classic-wow-server-queue-times-eu)

Ah true scum being scum.

It's 2019. Blizz should have developed a technology to allow this all the time but there were busy working on fucking microtransactions.

Yeah, I had reserved names on Pagle and Herod, ended up playing on Incendius for a few hours, then Westfall after I got disconnected and stuck in the queue there.

How in the hell did I get on Whitemane with a queue of only 3500??  Damn this makes me really nervous to call it my server.

There's your answer. The game people used to love started catering to a different crowd, it's natural there's some animosity there. The *amount* of vitriol is a bit disproportionate, but not unexpected.

Currently in my phone at work....

If I have an active us wow sub can I play on the eu classic realms ? Has anyone tried yet ? Apologies if its been posted already I'm on my phone.

It’s called 4chan good sir.

I tried and I also tried killing the process then restarting and also reinstalling the client still didnt work. I'm going to do it for the game now I guess

Not too horrible for old blanchy, everyone stay away from that server, I hear it smells funny
---
Your hopes will be horribly satisfied

Like hiking up a mountain or taking the cable car up there. One sucks while at it but it's fulfilling, the other is pretty while at it but it's empty. There is a kind of fun that feels *fun* after you are finished, and convenience it's anathema to it. It's deepwired on us.
---
That's a lesson to not be forgotten by any developers around.
---
If it stays like this for longer than a few days I'm going to dispute the charge on my credit card. I get the hype (I'm hype too) but the way Blizzard handled this launch is borderline unacceptable. It's been obvious for *weeks* that there weren't enough realms, people subscribed almost a month early to reserve names on realms that they can't even log into and Blizz's answer for them is to tell them to go on a new server - to me, that's stealing people's money, promising one thing and delivering another. 
---
I waited until launch day to sub specifically because I knew this was going to be a problem. Even having done that I can't login to my server (one of the new realms that opened on launch day.) Queues haven't dropped below 10k yet. 
---
I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt here and see where things are at come Thursday but I will absolutely not pay $15/month to stare at a login screen for 4 hours a day. Either way this first day has left a bad taste in my mouth and it doesn't feel right to me to support a company that would botch such a critical launch like this by underestimating their own customer base's enthusiasm for their product. They really, really shot themselves in the foot here and it's going to cost them money.
---

Que?

Please never add this
---
what quest addon is that?

If you are alliance on one server, make a horde on the other. Honestly don't worry about low population servers right now just play and enjoy the game. Worst case scenario you can always transfer off later with all your friends.
---
I understand now why the queue was going up by a few for me, I guess it was relogs jumping back in in front of the line
---
Everything sounds so....much angrier in german. 
---
feel you though &lt;/3
---
I've outgrown classic. I realized last night that my adult life just doesn't have time for the slow grindy nature of classic. I work 50+ hours per week and I have a kid so childish things like classic wow just aren't on my radar anymore.
---
Sure I could fuck around for an hour or two a day but that amounts to next to nothing in vanilla.
---
Hope everyone else gets to enjoy the game.
---
It should bother you, it's 2019, you can't be that technologically inept.
---
Idc about the money honestly it’s them acting like they really cared about letting people get together ahead of time for classic and they fail. Most people are stuck on servers they will have to move and reroll on anyways now.
---
I actually didn't know that! Thanks for sharing!
---
Right? These guys insisting on these servers, yet they they hop on a medium pop realm no queue. I was testing last night while asmon and esfand napped. I'm on Rattlegore, medium pop no queue. And medium pop today is a lot. The red servers are just for kids obsessed with streamers and delusional people trying to compete with the streamers.

Will they be expanding how many people are able to get in game to reduce que times, or will the long ques only die when less people play? If that question makes sense.

Ahhh thank you so much!!

---
Overwatch was a really bad example but only referenced because it's in Blizzard's portfolio.
---
I don't have to imagine the scaling or load balancing and i don't try to sound condescending, i still expect more from Blizzard and due to having to work with DevOps on similar scales on a regular basis (comparable architecture but totally different business) it's not like i'm not trying to emphasize.
---
So yes, for a once in a lifetime cultural phenomenon that World of Warcraft is and will be referred to as the benchmark for everything that comes after it and the business objective to once more capture that nostalgia for a final victory lap, i expected a way smoother launch.
---
I'd like to know the results of their stress testing.
---
no eu is a different sub than us
---
Sounds like Classic just isn't for you friend.
---
You've been in a que for 6 hours? What server?
---
Much more civil than the medallion quest in Valley of Trials. I suggested we stand in a single file line too. lol.
---
Get the fuck out to the retail xD
---
Well said, bad planning and underestimating requirements is what this is about.
---
Nah there won't be queues forever on that realm, it'll be just like vanilla's launch with insane queues every evening for a couple of weeks, after that things will go back to normal.
---
How?
---
I knew about this, and then immediately forgot in my excitement when the boat actually arrived in Menethil instead of teleporting me to a random graveyard I  Darkshore like it did the first time. Stupid...

Yeah my buddy got d/c'd and it put him the queue but my game crashed and I was allowed back in. Systems obviously not perfect. I was kind of shitting myself because I thought I was gonna put back in the 10k+ queue

Still no bags. I have bought 3 by now, hoping the fourth one will drop
---
How does that tard even work for them still?
---
They put in a bunch of new servers when the game launched, you must have missed that
---
Or just wait for the addons we had back then that worked just like quests do in current WoW. Some where even better imo then the current quest tracker.
---
Use bartender ez

that is a pretty good starter set

you may want to also download deadly boss mod (dbm) and Onebag
---
nothing besides full should have ques since if there are ques the servers obv. are FULL.
---
No its not 
---
And it's not about  that
---
They have added servers AFTER community already decided where they are going
---
And Noone cares to change it now. Even with new servers open. Should they prepare those 7 pvp EU EN servers 2 weeks ago everything would be different.
---
Because after all they created them. 
---
Simply too late.
---
I know that most of servers will be dead in few months. But I don't think this will happen to pvp EU EN ones...
---
I couldn't go back to take classes for the nostalgia, so I am teaching college classes instead. Now I panic about grading all the exams at the last minute instead of taking them.
---
I was 11 when I started playing, and I’m not from an English speaking country so reading the quest descriptions, let alone look them up on the internet wasn’t always easy, but dammit if it wasn’t fun anyways!
---
I only got to 10, about to leave town on my voidwalker quest.
---
Everying was super camped taking forever to quest or even grind, then got disconnected, instantly got back in, and was in a layer with like 10 people in the entire zone, boy did the quests fly by then.
---
Skinning. Wait till 60 then get your gold sink profession like enchanting or engineering. The only reason to get enchanting early is the wand and they are everywhere right now.
---
Go into shop and in the Tab with the "World of Warcaft" logo in it, you then click on WoW Classic and buy a subscribtion
---
Hey remember when layering was the worst thing ever and was going to destroy the game?
---
ShareX master race because it's objectively the best one.
---
So can we just create a character and server transfer it later?
---
Warcrafttavern.com has a decent list for classic addons.
---
Cool intolerance.
---
You beeing baffled by this baffles me
---
I agree, just started my senior year and I still think that college is way easier than highschool
---
I work in software development. What do you think is more likely? A bug on day 1 crashing a few layers and disconnecting everyone in the process or blizzard actively preventing people from playing because they are evil?
---
What? The dwarf in the back? Also how do you get humans that pale. I tried to make one just like me and they all had tans and square jawlines.
---
I need that pasty white skin and bad posture
---
Preach!

This made me laugh, thanks.
---
9 mins estimated for 12k queue 1000 mins estimated for 24k queue...
---
Oh, sorry then for misunderstanding.
---
RP is truly back!
---
wait 15 years until the next wave of wow classic classic
---
The thing you have to realize when you watch him is 99% of the things he says are either sarcastic or a joke. He doesn't change tone at all, so for people that don't watch him they think he is being serious. 
---
E.g. last night after he got kicked he was "complaining" about not having streamer privilege but it was a joke. There were posts attacking him for saying that, but they didn't realize it was a joke. I'm pretty sure most of the "bad behavior" stuff is like that. After watching a couple of his streams I think he is actually a good person, he just likes messing with people that don't understand he is joking. 
---
Also imo he is more interesting to watch than any other wow streamer. I tried watching sodapoppin, kala, a couple others, and they just weren't as interesting.
---
Baffling!
---
I'm confused. So we are all on server "A" but we are then broken into sub servers like A1 A2 A3 ?
---
make a remote desktop, and start the queue when you are at work
---
Quick! Copy and paste a WoW logo on it before you get locked for low effort!!!
---
I wanted to leave the cinema a few times because of the reasons you mentioned. Cringed very hard when she cried like a wolf.
---
Wait till you’ve just logged in from the queue and alt+F4 to show us your progress.
---
Level 15 Tauren Warrior, hate the game already. Definitely had a shit time in Ragefire Chasm. Back to retail for me.
---
Yes I'm kidding.
---
While we were in queue (in game) for mobs last night I was throwing Arcane intellect on people waiting and each time it would create a ripple effect of all the other people throwing out buffs. It was really cool to see, first all the people lining up to do quest and that everyone was being really helpful and friendly. We had a few asshats who just cut the line but most people were awesome.
---
Horde is universally more popular but there are going to be a few pocket servers where Alliance are more popular (usually from large Alliance guilds and then Alliance players who are tired of always being the underdog).
---
Personally I like the Alliance. None of it matters too terribly unless you wanted to play Priest or Warlock. If you want to play Priest, make a Dwarf Priest because they get Fear Ward (Priest is the only class that gets specific spells based on your race) and Fear Ward is very very good. It makes some boss fights in raids much easier and is very useful in PvP. If you want to play Warlock, play Horde. Horde Undead get a racial ability that makes them immune to almost all of the warlock CC. So if you are Alliance and get into PvP with an undead, you will have a very hard time winning since Warlock's style is a war of attrition (at least for now until they open up later tiers of raids and gearing). And undead is usually the most popular Horde race, so those chances aren't too small. Dwarf, on the other hand, is not too popular so the fear wards will be fewer.
---
Mechanically, that's the biggest difference between the two. Then there are the special classes. If you wanted to be a paladin or shaman, you're locked to either Alliance for paladin or Horde for shaman. Both classes are buffers and have dps specs that aren't *good* but can absolutely troll people in PvP. Shamans get windfury and so sometimes you just proc extra attacks and absolutely destroy and sometimes you never proc attacks and get destroyed. It's a big RNG fiesta spec for PvP. Paladins can abuse mechanics to force monsters to crit them  (/sit and you have a 100% chance to be crit while sitting) and get stacks of reckoning (grants an extra attack when crit) and then go reckbomb someone and usually one-shot them. Other than those troll dps specs for world PvP, they are largely just healers.
---
If you really want to throw back to the stereotypes of vanilla wow, Alliance had two groups of people. Old gamers and children. All the super young kids seemed to gravitate towards the Alliance and then all the grizzled old gamer dads/grandpas seemed to be there too. The teenagers and people in their early 20s played Horde. Why? Probably largely due to the aesthetics and edginess of the horde being more savage and "evil but not really evil" and Alliance being perceived as stuck-up or goody two-shoes. Either way, that's how it always felt back in the actual vanilla days.
---
Rice
---
My friend and I did the exact same thing and with those exact same servers. I’d say a lot of people did this and the pops are probably only low because it’s early morning. I don’t know
---
There's no one else to blame but Blizzard. Don't put it on the players that Blizzard were very unaware and unprepared about the interest of this game.
---
Your johnson was disconnected?  How are you doing?
---
They’re 100% going to give people free time for the queues.
---
I have a Vive. There's nothing great there yet. No one is willing to invest big money into VR games (not that I blame them). Just re-hashed M+KB games like Skyrim for you to spend $60 again.
---
I don’t think they would open transfers this early.  Most people can just start over as they are mostly under level 10.
---

---
Probably because most people playing won't make it to 60 so there's no need to get gold for the epic mount
---
this isnt new to wow .... but new to mmos
---
I always liked zero sum
---
I held off on deciding a server until the day I was going to play. The newest one was the one I picked. It was full.. but I imagined it was "less full" than the others. At 11pm last night I queued for the midnight opening. I had 1400th spot. Not too bad, in my mind. I stuck with it. Played for 6 hours.. only to realize TODAY that there's a fucking 20k queue to join in. All my friends and hell, even my region joined that specific server because it was new. It's probably become the most crowded one of them all.
---
I never mentioned seamless and 0 day-1 issues but that feels botched in more ways than one.
---
I kind of expected queues (not to the double digit thousands degrees tbh) and maybe delayed layering.
---
I'm only really livid about the session's being killed aswell because that prevents you from reconnecting in a certain timeframe. 
---
You could argue that it was necessary to end sessions but then we'd be back to the scaling.
---
Ultimately i'd like to see some numbers because i think the Wow Classic servers might have multiple times the traffic retail bfa is supposed to have and Blizzard didn't anticipate those.
---
Open more servers and buy more server space if they cannot handle it. $15 a month pays for that shit.
---
It was probably just the people waiting in que for 5+ hours...
---
I wouldn't worry about distribution. If it's really skewed, I am pretty sure they will let people transfer once it balances out.
---
It is sad those people fell for a trap quest, and wasted a ton of time.
---
What is this?
---
Most guilds will not use DKP because it's not an effective way to gear for future raids.
---
Unfortunately I am on the same boat as you. I ended creating a toon on Kirtonos because all other servers had 5k queue upwards.
---
I have been in a queue on Firemaw, for 8 hours now, before that, a 4 hour queue where I got disconnected. Welcome to the club.
---
6months sub is 65€ so they might have referred to that
---
Thanks man! If you are also partaking in one of the greatest adventures ever. I wish the safe travels friend. FOR THE ALLIANCE 🦁
---
I just uber nerded
---
It’s session based, so when your session expires you will get put into the next available layer when you log in again. The session is tied to your log in grace period (at least from my understanding).
---
Oh I totally agree but I think it's just what the younger kids are use to.
---
Fitting
---
Tyvm I'm going to try again when I get home. I've never seen UIs like these before I used to use x pearl I think it was called. These new uis are smooth and so minimalistic that's my freaking style I love it
---
Binging starts in 1 hr, assuming I find a server :)
---
Had to log off after I dinged 10 as well, sitting in the office thinking I'm too old for these late night gaming sessions downing a large coffee...and looking forward to doing it all over again tonight
---
Wow, that's surprisingly cool of them. That server is going to have some very interesting stories haha
---
The main reason I don't like him is he promotes scamming, toxicity and just being an asshole in general. Sure, the drama and entitlement can be attributed to the persona, but once you start telling your audience how to scam and be a general asshole, you deserve to lose your platform. Unfortunately, the majority of his audience is children and neckbeards, so they love the edgy shit. I feel like it has a negative effect on the community just by promoting that type of behavior, and giving these assholes somewhere to connect.

Not sure who downvoted.   This was the fix.  Same thing as OP.  There was no option for classic just like this.  Reinstalling the battle net client fixed it so the classic option appeared+
---
Yep. There was also a spear or flag stuck into the ground that 2 men were trying (and failing) to pull out of the ground and Jon did it one handed while talking.
---
they thought we didn't want, but we did
---
It's not the destination, it's the journey!
---
isometric gameplay
---
What has that got to do with anything. The whole point blizzard keeps making is play on medium realms when all of them end up full.
---
What i am saying is that they should be adding new realms the second the ones before reach medium in order to not reach full.
---
Read again man you missed my whole point...
---
Your skill isn't going to get you very far when the boss can one shot everyone in the raid.
---
I'm playing on my old PC, 9 years old.   Intel i7 875k, 8 gigs of ram with a gtx550 ti video card.   Runs smooth on classic settings.

Insecurities and wanting to fit in
---
A stormlight reference on a WoW thread? By the stormfather's beard...
---
Mostly retail players, that's how retail works, so just be patient, they'll end up leaving. On the opposite side I've seen queues to kill quest mobs and people giving loot to nearby players and teaming up
---
Im just gonna wait a few days until the starting areas are more empty lol
---
Lmao peace bub
---
Yeah look for the ones marked 1.13
---
Oh lawd.
---
Nice man but we’ve seen this so often already
---
I haven't been able to try yet but it is already much better than yesterday, Herod became medium in population as well as Sulfuron and server caps were raised. The devs/sysadmins made a hell of a work
---
What do people that were arguing with "I better sit in a queue for 20 minutes than have layering" think now?
---
I agree. But I also think people are ok with making new freinds. I know our group is always down to add more people into it.
---
Damn,  rip,  when I get back from work.  :((
---
Shazzrah?

Razor is mainly alliance im told, but cant say on. UK numbers

Not if queues are long 4 weeks.

---
Isnt it time for them to add more layers?
---
You have no idea how the Star Wars Galaxies community must feel lol.
---
They said it kind of like that: the pop counter is dynamic, which means when the "full" server has a queue with 17k+ then the servers with 4-5k compared to the "full" server are medium or low
---
The hell you do. Play on a lower pop server for a couple weeks while leveling and then pay the $10 or however much it is for a server transfer. You will save so many hours in a queue.
---
I respect your opinion but for me it's even more fun than I remember!
---
I did this - got to 10 last night, while everyone in discord sat in queue. Brutal start, but they'll catch up while I'm at work today.
---
It'll be like playing a whole new character, since I just got bear form, which absolutely slaps at lvl 10.
---
Thats why you funnel everything to your tank and main healer.
---
That’s me at the front of the line! 
---
Also, I had such a good time playing with you all last night.
---
Stalagg is also popping if your east coast.
---
They did open more servers.
---
Fairbanks. Logged in an hour before, played for 6 hours. Random DC, 30min queue, played for 8 hours.
---
Gyazo though.
---
She has voiced her for BFA as well I believe!
---
There might have been once, but there isn't any longer. If you don't like spam chat is the wrong place for you today anyway.
---
Other people's languages won't kill you.
---
I made my Warrior Ench / Alchemy cause I want to use Alchemy for Goldmaking..
---
I plan on running chain-dungeons at 60 and reserving flasks. EZ mode
---
I just asked because in many other games it's nearly impossible to progress after the game is out for some years.
---
This is probably the last man who should be turning off the tips
---
Grace period doesn't work, multiple people who dc, just go straight to the back oft he queue
---
A lot of people (myself included) never got on last night. I waited in queue for 3 hours before I had to go to bed for work -- started at 16000th and ended at 5900th.
---
kek
---
No , im on Golemag but other EU realms have same problem right?
---
Full-time high stress job, wife and kid here, also I have commission side gig. I am maining a Alliance Warrior to tank. All about time priority.
---
So I vaguely have an idea about this, but I'm not into computer science and I don't know shit about servers.
---
After my 3 hour wait yesterday, I was tossed in suddenly when I was around 2k in que. When I appeared, so did about 50-60 other humans. I ended up skipping some quests to actually get kills, which was entirely barren. 
---
There is no reason that area should have been barren of other players. So I think there is some kind of throttle or layer more than we know. Like, they were letting the gates open slowly, closing them, then reopening once people moved out of starting areas or some layers were consolidated of people.
---
I just played on a private server that did thousands of transfers between servers to even out low and medium populations. They did this at a fraction of the funding of what Blizzard has and the technology they have capable to do it. So what if people are locked out for a few days, which by the way didn’t happen on the private server. If that is what it takes to make this game accessible to the demands of the consumer they need to accomplish it because it is 100% doable.

---
Worst part is that you can get booted out of the game and thrown into the back of the queue. 
---
Might be that a layer is shut down and everyone in it gets kicked... Terrible system... :(
---
Punching pigs for the kill steal is definitely authentic vanilla
---
GMs could do almost anything they wanted/needed
---
They say minimal down time of 15 minute. English isn’t my first language, does it mean that it will take at least 15 minute and it could last much longer or it’s a quick 15 minute maintenance ? Thanks !
---
Unless they re-release classic, deff not.
---
last night me and my friends were able to log in and out on faerlina while asmon was stuck in that fat queue LUL
---
why the fuk you record your screen ffs
---
I managed to watch this by chance. I had his stream on earlier during the day, but paused it after my cousin finally joined the realm. We called it quits for the night and then I decided to turn Asmons stream back on and literally 2-3 mins later he gets the disconnect. XD
---
lol /r/MadeMeSmile
---
Noggenfogger is free of queue
---
&gt;  The remedy was layering.
---
Are they using layering in Classic? Isn't that where they have multiple instances of outdoor zones?
---
Y'all need some Westfall in your life.
---
Thuuuunderoooome
---
If you are so financially strained that you have to wait for payday to make a $15 purchase, maybe you shouldn't be spending that $15 on WoW.
---
Yeah, the only thing I could find on Blizz's site was their own UI files, so I've been going through those.
---
Disagree with your assessment though, most pieces of software have awesome API documentation, although that's usually since they get value out of integration where WoW really does get little value out of the API, it is like you say a bonus. Knowing to stop looking is just as useful as knowing where the answer is, thank you for your responses you've saved me hours of frustration.
---
WELL AREN'T YOU SPECIAL?
---
But this isn’t what happened, I was in EK on another eastern US server at the same time as Asmon and didn’t get DCed.
---
Really because the 2013 iPhone 5S seems to be running better with the latest iOS, and afaik nobody claimed the same for Macs. 
---
Or are you referring to clock speeds being slowed on iPhones as the battery ages, something you can now disable in settings?
---
I actually turned "Instant Quest Text" off. It's going to take some time to stop the "GO GO GO GO" retail mentality, but this morning I realized that the slower pace was something I used to enjoy.
---
I mean really? I finally was able to log in last night at about 10 p.m. and I was online for about 5 minutes and I said fuck it. It was a mad house with everyone doing the same quest. To me $15 is $15 it doesn’t break me by any means.
---
Ummmm this happened to me on Herod twice.  
---
 First time at about 7pm central.  15 minute wait. 
---
Again at about 11pm central.  Zero wait.
---
10 seconds times a thousand is like a million!

It's not unlikely ppl already ARE grouped - just not with you.

I bought one cause I needed it desperately and then got the other 2 as drops right after

Dosent work with an iphone does it?
---
I was getting in and out of Razorgore with no queue about 2 hours ago now its 5000 queue, have the servers borked or something? It's hardly peak time.
---
Yeah, it's amazing the amount of fortitudes, marks and thorns I've gotten!
---
I am playing on the same computer i built during burning crusade in 2007
---
I don't get it.
---
Melee attack first. Have your weapon unequiped to tag, it’s faster, you can still equip it once in combat. I’d also recommend finding a quiet(ish) spot and staying put instead of running about.
---
Yeah, at least 15 minutes or more
---
Grats mate!
---
Sucks About the wipe but still got the kill at least
---
That is so nice. Much love from razorfen(Eu)
---
One of the things that made me aware, that Blizz put so many references to al sorts of movies etc. in the game. The joke from human males is the second lotr reference I know of. Are there more?
---
My buddy on white mane just hit 22 as a hunter been playing since servers launched. I am sure that will start to go faster with AotC 
---
I was happy with 13 and my bear form quest completed with 7 hours of sleep but hey... I am
---
Easy. Don't join a DKP guild because DKP is probably the worst loot system ever conceived.
---
I had a 4k queue for grobbulus and I saw some streamers with up to 8k so idk if rppvp is much better
---
Your sack is so hot.
---
Undead priest here; like a lot of people below are saying, I had to unequip my starting mace just to have a chance at tagging, still not as fast as rogues/warriors tho 😭 leveling has been a pain so far haha
---
Can confirm the same on Myzrael.
---
You just take quests and do them. There shouldn't be a need to do them all. Tho, some follow up quests might have rewards you'd like.
---
I think I put Fortitude on about 400 players this morning. That's the best gift I can give.
---
People see his viewer numbers, but not the 7 years he put into youtubing/streaming he did to get up to that point.
---
It ended up having a queue, and now there is 3 PvP servers.
---
Most people use addons like Questie that do this automatically.
---
Then there’s the EXTREMELY vocal minority that thinks reading the often vague and lacking quest text makes them Vanilla purists and better than everyone else.
---
That's for a box that spawns, the real chaos is inside that cave. People were telling to get in groups so 5 people at a time could get the item.
---
Finally got the medallion!
---
I've got next week off, just got to make it to Friday!
---
I had a guy whisper "Fuck you" because my lightning bolt beat his charge to a mob, so i got the tag and not him.
---
fucking love this video meme format #elresitas
---
Yeah that’s what I meant
---
I keep wondering if other developers will see how popular this classic is and try and go back to a more "hardcore" MMO instead of the disney land shit that most MMOs are now...

Similar to u/haxmire, I got up around 530 and played for three hours before work. No queue at the time but I could tell chat was getting busier by the time I got off.
---
Lower rise, thunder bluff
---
Got to lvl 6 on my UD rogue. Collected the quests in Brill then headed to the Undercity to train skinning and /bow to the queen.
---
Fed up with systems constantly changing. I hate that I feel forced to grind reps thru dailies and time gating etc. Classic you can grind at your pace and you have freedom to make more choices. Also you know what your aiming for bis and not hoping for a titan forge or random stats. Community is massive aswell I can't remember adding anyone on battle net for the last few years  etc.
---
I am ok with small quality of life improvements. Like once you accept the quest, it immediately starts tracking on the right side of your screen, rather than pressing L 20 times to reread it.
---
I hope they treat this game like Old School Runescape where we get new content but it’s community driven and community voted on.
---
Can i actually use it to stayb logged in? I have to go to a fuckin bbq later on but i dont wanna go in queue again lol.
---
Go hit up the Blood for Blood guild on Stalagg, they are still recruiting.
---
Sounds great until blizz gives us 1 free transfer. Waited in kromcrushes queue for 2 minutes and enjoyed the game for 5 hours.
---
Thats not even a desk for 2 lol
---
Wow needs a r/cutenoobs equivalent
---
Sounds like aids
---
I am not sure if I completely misunderstood layering, but wasn't layering supposed to allow 15-20k people online at the same time, but each layer with 3k?
---
How are there queues on servers with the layering technology? Shouldn't we just get into a new layer every time 3k players are reached on one layer, while still all being on the same server?
---
So I'm gonna be that guy. 300k watching Asmon doesn't mean the game will be insanely popular... 3 months from now.
---
Like every streamer tries the new game for a few days/weeks then back to normal. Now Classic is a different beast with so many top streamers dedicating 2-6 months of their life to it.
---
But still the large influx of people now is in no way a proof that even half of them will remain 3 months from now.
---

I sold a double stat green lvl 10 or 12 sword for 70silver lol
---
I have 2 kids ages 3 and 2 so hoping on for launch was iffy as I have responsibilities. It I managed to balance that day and still care for my kiddos. It is totally doable but you just can’t get in that “just one more mob or one more quest mindset.” The trick is to make a small goal and reach it so when you do if you have time left over indulge and if you don’t you are able to still hop off with a sense of accomplishment.
---
Would truly appreciate someone taking the time to help me out.
---
Just mail them to an alt. There is the bank in the main cities, but it is not worth the run. You do not need to even log into the alt just create it and mail them the stuff you want to save.

Snippy&gt;Paste into Imgur is my jam

People are worried their servers won't be populated enough. In Classic, this can be a make it or break it difference when trying to get groups for dungeons and pretty much everything on PvP servers.
---
Is there EU version of this?
---
No, are you okay bro?
---
Short answer, yes. 
---
Long answer:
---
There are optimal specs and the majority want you to play that spec. So just find people who doesn't care that mutch. At the end casual guilds are going to have problems to find 40 people to raid so maybe you are lucky and can enter the raid anyway. Most of the non optimal/viable specs need more preparation and more knowledge to be viable enough.
---
For example:
---
Druid tank, are great dungeons tanks. With enough gear you will have more hp and more armor then any other tank. But you have to put more time into it and grinding some items. 
---
Druid boomkin, well 3% cirt is it what it brings to the table? Good enough but you need to downrank your spells bc you are more likely to be an oomkin!
---
And so on, so will have an easier life to choose a certain class bc you wanna play tank (warrior) or something at the end. But if you realy like something then stick with it and surprise other players.
---
Maybe we're at work or school. Good luck again after 5 eastern, and this weekend.
---
News flash, the new servers they told people to use instead also had very long que times
---
Maybe you should learn what happened before calling people morons? Unless you are calling blizzard morons for not predicting this obvious problem
---
This is a 5-6 hour queue. I believe the new pvp realms have 2-3 hour queues right now so it’s quite better.
---
Its a lot longer, got cut off
---
Saga guide for guidelime (in game addon)
---
2012 and newer should be fine. That’s the earliest model that supports Metal.
---
Yeah, its not, we are improvising :D
---
Just guessing but it seems that they revised the classification from name reserve week to after launch, such that before the terms were based on total players or characters reserved on each realm, and now, post-launch, they seem to have gone back to the more familiar indication of current logged in players. So overall most of the realms have dropped one level according to these terms, but "High" still means there is a queue, and "Full" means really long queues. "Low" and "Medium" mean no queue or short queue, but "Low" does not mean "dead." There still were loads of people running around when I got into my "Low" realm early A.M. today with no queue.
---
Makes you wanna buy Greenland, right?
---
It was me that got your spot and I found multiple 6 slotted bags from specifically the mobs you would have killed if you didn't get DCed
---
Two hours? I got kicked from the server at seemingly random 2 hours ago and I’m soon halfway through the queue.
---
I hope it will be back in less than 2 hours, the only time I can play today will be between 11:30 and 13:00 east time.
---
It start 10:00 east time right ?
---
Not firemaw. Been in queue for 3 hours and expect another 2.
---
More like "Classic hard, in some aspects mostly outside max level content and for reasons relating to mathematical numbers being the deciding factor for success and failure such as "Healing out vs damage in" with little to no skill ceiling and heavy gear dependency for both DPS, healing and tanking and little to no rotational skill needed, and ez in most other areas"
---
"Retail Ez in leveling and low level content as well as gear catch up and getting propelled into endgame content, but endgame content is much much more skill than gear dependent with rotational understanding, reaction speeds, and understanding of tactics, planning and preparation and understanding of the flow of damage, combat and healing is the factor for success, leaving Solo content EZ but high end Content Hard AF with a vider variety of what is hard and what is easy"
---
Yeah, the "morons" in que did exactly what blizzard suggested
---
....were you trying to skin humans?
---
Welcome to classic also good luck on bags
---
Step one: Get 1 silver.
---
Step two: Learn skinning and get a knife.
---
Step three: Go to an area where there's a quest full of animals and skin them all for a couple of minutes.
---
Step four: Vendor all leather.
---
Step five: Get four 5 silver bags from the vendor.
---
I buffed so many people waiting in line for Yarrog that I didn't have enough mana to tag him when he spawned, lol.
---
Yojamba - Oceanic  
---
I died so many times getting here haha
---
The "fix" will be less people logging into those servers simultaneously.
---
I am still thinking about to change place. :D She is sitting on left side.
---
You want to use whatever weapon has the best stats (Intellect, Spell Damage, etc.), which may be a sword depending on where you are in the game and what weapons youve acquired so far. As a mage, you wont be meleeing people, so weapon damage and weapon skill will not affect you at all. The only weapon damage/skill relevant to mages is wands.
---
Got to lvl 3 at launch before I got kicked into a 20k queue. 
---
This morning I got in pretty quickly, but I got kicked out again and stuck in another queue. 3 hours later still sitting here with the estimated time &gt;1 minute. 
---
Good times!
---
No mouse = stealth play
---
Used to do this same thing. Careful friend it’s a slippery slope.
---
Did the same thing and ill be doing it again tonight. I have a character again, and levels and gear matter!!!!
---
Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap!
---
As a troll hunter, now 6,5 at razor hill, when/where so I train for mining, engineering, first aid, cooking and fishing?
---
Only if you are whispering their battle.net
---
The fix is to play on a different server that isn't so crowded.
---
Good thing you are starting it... in a video game of all places lol
---
I locked my action bar but when I hold shift to sprint and use mouse wheel it scrolls through the action bar sets. Is there a way to prevent it from goin to the other actionbars that are blank?
---
Staves tend to have better stats for mages in general, but there are some swords out there that work well for casters. They're just a bit more rare.
---
Probably finish it before I get logged in
---
This happened to me, but I don't know if it's the same... try ctrl+s?
---
if you don't want to do "the run" you can swim along the coast a bit to the southwest and sneak over the mountains by getting close to the dun morogh gy and jumping to your death then rezzing at the gy.

I don't know who and why downvoted you. To me it seems, you reasonably mentioned why YOU don't want a vanilla. I upvote you.
---
Why do you feel the need for this attention one might ask
---
There is now a third german pvp server, patchwerk. No queue so far.
---
Cheers.
---
That's what happened to me last night but I stayed up past bedtime so I could create my chars, accept the first quest and logged off. I'm gonna setup remote connect on my computer so I can connect from work and start the login countdown early.
---
I'm just here to watch 30+ years olds lose their minds over a fucking game and defend it like a cult. It must be hard to know you peaked 15 years ago when you dinged 60,
---
how'd that work out for you
---
I agree with faster response. Also they need a better way of announcing changes. A battle.net notification could suffice, but I didn't know there were new servers until those servers already had a 10k and.
---
Server latency.  The amount of time it takes for your computer to communicate with Blizzard.
---
Go away.
---
I mentioned my expectations in another comment and i think it's not wrong to have some, i also didn't expect a perfect launch :)
---
change or remove the keybindings
---
Journeywow is already 28. If it's truly being account shared no one is catching them, they have a massive lead already.
---
What is your portrait/mini-map addon? Love it!
---
Its canadian dollars, it's like $365 USD
---
How dare someone think differently than me!
---
Why don't you take your toxic ass back to bfa or just stop trying to ruin everyone's fun?
---
It’s totally fine, it’s just slower than some other classes because you don’t have a pet and can’t conjure food or kite mobs.
---
Following for this!
---
Starter zone leveling, shouldn’t need a mouse too bad lol
---
Had the same on Golemagg. Second 17k queue of the day. Wooo
---
Why didn't you just stay logged in?
---
Night elfs maybe but i had a blast as a tauren finished mulgore at lvl 12 and logged out with 5hs played

Kromcrush is a very casual server with a good community. I  am pleased so far.
---
I tried several servers. Even the RP servers had 10K+ queue. Waited over 4 hours on queue before having to call it a night. If your customers can't access a paid product, then that is a fail. Pure and simple. And this is Blizzard we are talking about, not some new company without experience or capability. They just made a bad call pure and simple.
---
Dude I totally feel you in the misguided movie goer part. Absolutely agree. But we're talking marketing here and the money decision makers don't care if you're a 'true gamer' or a misguided movie goer, as long as you can make them money. So for that purpose, these people (so we agree they're not 'actual gamers' /gatekeeping) are part of what you'd mean when you talk avoht reachig casuals. At least that's hiw I read it. Hinestly as I'm writing this I'm not even sure if I got a point, you may just be entirely right in that these people aren't meant when a prof talks about reaching casuals...
---
Any guard can give you waypoints to trainers
---
Casuals.
---
I got 3 sacks dropped before I was level 4, guild was very jealous.
---
Friend told me Razorgore already 5k +. Moving to NoggenFogger, gg wp.
---
Hahahahahahhahha yeah dude that’ll show em
---
I just want to play :(
---
That's what I did. In truth I tried to get in line at first, but it turned on a clusterfuck of people not respecting the line. It became a total waste of time wainting, so I abandoned the quest and got to grind to earn XP and skins to vendor. Much better.
---
ARE YOU STRESSED JEN? ARE YOU STRESSED?
---
Lmao honestly though
---
Sorry to say, but with his toxic personality, this is pure karma.
---
We did :) everyone were out in like 10 minutes
---
You all demanded they turn layering off ASAP,  this is the pain that was basically inevitable. 
---
Either you launch with too many servers and deal with people spergin out about their stupid character names when they have to merge later, or you monitor shit and add servers as needed to try to minimize the amount of merging or transfers later. But you have to stick to a hard cap that will allow you to turn off layering in phase 2. 
---
I personally think Blizzard chose the worse option but the community bears some responsibility as well with their stubbornness. I don't know your region but in mine there are multiple newer servers that weren't pre announced that had manageable queues last night and probably won't have any within a few days.
---
It fits, since that kind of speech was common back in the Classic wow days.
---
That’s so funny, I literally just posted yesterday that this is my first time ever playing wow and I’m also a dad and that’s the server I picked naturally. This is hilarious. Waited in queue last night for 4 hours to play for 30 minutes before my kids woke up.
---
Small Indy company
---
I think 1.12 has 15 minutes buffs for paladins
---
I was surprised I walked over and no one was doing the quest. He was just there. On Skeram last night
---
GTA V release was huuuge.
---
Players in Brill were doing that last night and got a lot of traffic.  I'm eager to get another 4 linen myself for a 3rd bag.
---
Just bored tbh... Plasma takes about 45 mins
---
Logic?
---
You might have been in a sparsely populated layer.
---
How do you know there are only four on your layer? Its a big zone
---
Kromcrush dad here as well
---
We changed absolute last minute. Some people levelled to 10 on the wrong server and they were not happy. However in the long run, it's going to be better. Even if the queue is only 30 mins per day, it will add up. Reality is I think on the EU the servers for Firemaw and Shazzrah will stay huge for weeks.
---
Swap bags. Right click on the x in the corner. It will show the bag slots
---
Time and other info are datasets. They are not displayed by default you need to tell it to display them.
---
I don't know if it has been ported to classic but there is/was an addon called MoveAnything which unlocked all ui elements without altering graphics and textures.
---
Yah thats an mmo that what end game content looks like. Same for classic, bc, wotlk, cata, mop,wod,leg. Once you get to end game all you have is dailies, weeklies and proving your worth to others. Only diffrence is the amount of time you take to get to end game.
---
^(I'm not an R-tard...)
---
So go for boar or whale? Or a mix of both for strength and stam? Didn’t think of this but going to do it for sure
---
Clearly there was an overwhelming number of people who want PVP in their game.  I was kind of surprised, really in how few people were interested in the one and only RP server.  It is no different than any Normal server.
---
This is why I don’t like games, it only appeals to the male fantasies
---
what would you say if there is no german server with a queue of under 13k at 1 pm?
---
Okay this is some good stuff.
---
Good thing I'm out of the house right now. Probably going to get stuck I that 30k herod queue.
---
ROLL THE DICE
---
What does it mean for us? Probably just a little more rain than usual....
---
The youngest a millennial (late millennial) could be right now is 23, so he’s most likely gen z along with a large portion of people on reddit these days.

I never played druid in vanilla, and was wondering how viable bears are at tanking? Looking at mostly 5 man + perhaps some offtanking in raids. I am not looking to be MT.
---
MAN PLAY GAME
---
I thought they played on Whitemane.
---
You can sit at character selection screen for 30 mins
---
on any earlier version just search "snipping tool" and pin it to task bar.
---
Yup. Playing on a 2012 MacBook Pro. Runs fine
---
I think its because the dude insinutated we are all doing "childish things"
---
I am 10, still none for me also.
---
But I do have my wand, so it's ok.
---
That's not really the case for me... People don't care and continue their way when I buff/heal/help them with a mob. When I ask in town if someone wants to chill and quest with me I just get ignored. Guess i'll just wait some days until the hardcore babies go away
---
Why would they molest children?
---
By far the best MMO experience I've ever had.
---
Similar, newbie undead running towards the Scarlet Monastery.  I was /y'ing at npc skulls that they shouldn't be killing low level players like my friend and I.
---
I have set this as my personal goal in Classic. Congratulations!
---
Same. Still waiting. It's at 8382 in queue now, gone down about 2k since I posted. Time for a nap whilst I wait I think.
---
HOLY LIGHT!
---
Nobody yet.
---
This is what I was waiting for. Kids from Retail crying in forums because of reasons. This will be very funny xDDD
---
People will eventually spread out as they get bored for queues everyday
---
We switched to Kirtonos as soon as it opened. Haven't been queues there.
---
If you have responsibilities, just avoid the crazy no-life servers.
---
25 man's were always better than 40 man's imo
---
To experience once again the game that made me the gamer I am today. So nostalgia is a reason. But experimentation is also in my mind that's why I am conflicted
---
It's a work day, even a school day for some districts that started early. Doomsaying less than 24 hours after launch is stupid.
---
Yes! Loving these awesome bromances!
---
Yeah I rolled on low pop server and even then I got a few 5 minute queues. People are saying low pop is more like vanilla high pop back in the day so I'm not worried about being on a low pop server. Seen a few people worried about it in general chat though lol
---
God you really, really hate yourself lol
---
Honestly free unlimited transfers for a few weeks would be great, allows for you to play on ANY server before you go and join your friends on the server you want to be on. I want to play with my friends, but I don’t want to wait 10 hours to do so.

---
The problem with adding servers is that when a large portion of the population inevitably quits in a month, there will be a lot of dead low-pop servers if they add too many now
---
Im down to go to BC, in time. But what remains to be seen is, how far do we go?
---
Wrath? Cata? Mists?
---
God forbid... WoD?
---
When servers go live they use dynamic population counting. It's because of the time of day
---
 +3 levels above you is a real pain, group quest are really group quest unlike on retail, but it also depends on your class
---
Certainly for a melee character.
---
Yep forgot about that. Better hurry once they come back up.
---
Not been able to get in at all. Given I have 4 hours spare time each night dont hold our much hope either later.
---
No I want to play with my friends on Stalagg after switching when they said and reserving my name weeks ahead of time.
---
Yeah mines at 8233 still... Cheers blizz for being prepared
---
Yea the day of and 6 hours after the launch.
---
It's pretty competitive right now, with the massive influx of people. Fighting to get that first hit on a mob is something you'll see happening a lot. 
---
Most enemies the same level will give you a good run for your money if you're a caster class. They're not "hard" per se, but they won't be total facerolls. I'm playing as a priest right now, and mana gets drained pretty quickly, because enemies the same level or higher will resist spells or dodge attacks.
---
In terms of drop rates, they're back to abysmal levels. You might kill 40 of something to get 6 of the item you need to complete a quest. But that's Vanilla for you! 
---
Good luck out there!
---
I dont know about anyone else, but this gave me chills like the playstation commercial in the tavern.
---
12000 for Incendius yet a 9 min wait....compared to the Bucs having 3,000 and a 47 wait.
---
When I got home about 3 hours after launch, Bucs only took me 20 minutes to log in behind 2500 people.
---
And yet, people are constantly posting about "You think you do but you don't". Premature celebration could be the subtitle for this sub.
---
It's not acceptable but blizzard isn't infallible. I agree with what others are saying. The queue will go down soon and at the very least once people level up more and more the starting zones should clear out a little. Just gotta be a little more patient! We will all be 60 soon enough!
---
Lol you need to relax a bit
---
Which realm? Consider moving?  
---
Hold shift to sprint? Is this a thing?
---
PvP servers did this last night as well, but I’m sure it was a smoother thing for RP servers.
---
just got off 3 minute que for whitemane, ohh hell yeah!
---
Layers are the entire world. It’s either that or sharding. I prefer layers, as this issue isn’t prevalent except during the lowest activity hours.
---
Probably.
---
But I spent all of BC as Tauren being locked out of a lot of fun mounts, and lord knows I'm not doing that again for Classic.
---
It's a word that existed long before it's sexual reference, like Orgy.
---
You can have an Orgy of food.  (meaning a shit tons  of food, not the ending of the sausage party cartoon..)
---
However once something has picked up a sexual meaning, it become taboo to use it in any other context and gradually changes, so that it's only commonly used in sexual context.
---
I just had my friend make me 4x 6 slot bags. Very thankful
---
Nope, all the servers are dead and Blizzard was right. We thought we wanted it, but we didn't.
---
Hopefully we can rally the troops and maybe when they wake up and get home from work, we can save these servers and bring them back to life.
---
Almost wanted to call in sick today
---
*Laughs in Netherguard realm.*
---
Shut the fuck up, boomer.
---
I logged in at 6:30PM central time.  Tried a higher population server and it was a 2HR wait with 9k people in queue, but then went to another server and the wait was much shorter.  I mean, granted I didn't have my hopes up for a specific server to play on. I can imagine it would be a pain if you wanted to be on the biggest server and having to wait.  But again, it's launch day dude.  If I can get into the game on the first day of launch, play for a couple hours, and not immediately crash, I consider that an absolute win.
---
I would heavily advise if youre abble to, to connect via teamviewere/chrome desktop or anything similar to queue in or you wont play today...
---
Get one of your group with an insta cast ability make a macro. /Target X on the first line then /cast and shift click the spell in your spellbook on the second line. Then spam said button had to do it to kill the quillboar chief in the Tauren starting area. Only thing that sucks is moonfire beats out earth shock when it comes to this.
---
The way I picture it is opt-in one-way character migrations. You can choose to go forward to the next xpac but never backwards.
---
Lol no. Read again.
---
&gt; don't get so butt-hurt, un-clench it and relax.
---
That should be the advice for the person who asked the question initially.
---
What makes you so special that you “don’t belong in this line?”
---
20'000 auf lucifron :)
---
Whats the queue for?
---
Yeah I called it at 1:30 I’m actually feeling pretty good. Man last night was awesome.
---
i am a newbie, and playing a priest, i went HAM on buffing people thinking how cool it was, reminding me of everquest getting breezed by the random enchanter
---
+8h on EU top PvP realms
---
Kromcrush was just added yesterday and I was able to play on it for a while, seemed to be pretty stable
---
some guy said that EU won't be having a restart
---
I have instant quest text on but i still read the quests all the time for instructions. I even use road signs when getting around!  It's been a blast and i love feeling like Im exploring a brand new world again. "is this quest over here? guess it wouldn't hurt to check..."
---
I am on skeram...
---
Which was a new server opened and suggested by blizzard to avoid the long ques.
---
I waited 5 hours before going to bed.  Still had an estimated 4 hours to go when I gave up
---
No I totally understand. Levels mean a lot more than they do in retail and I like the challenge of having to pick your battles
---
I love how 10 silver ain’t no small thing
---
Red gang
---
Lol, normie is mad. 
---
Did they ban your other account from classic wow? reported
---
After work probably.
---
Cool thanks, sounds like what I want it to be so maybe i'll check it out
---
Looking for help on my class please. Playing on a 15” laptop so I don’t want anything to complex. I really enjoy world pvp and causing shenanigans, but also want to raid.
---
I mean... if they don't force me to move with you and let you move your character off classic, I have no objection.
---
the 'low, medium, high' are all relative.
---
So compared to Herod or w/e, your server might well be at max capacity but since it's not as big as Herod, it's put as a 'Low' pop.
---
Nah.
---
What version of mac do you run?
---
no definitely dont delete any characters.
---
read what the GM posted on this forum: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/medium-pop-still-has-login-queue/271551/9](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/medium-pop-still-has-login-queue/271551/9)
---
I wouldn't even try a mob 5 levels higher than me, especially early game. Maybe when you get a bit of gear to boost your health and damage, you could use CD's and pots. One of the big issues with a mob that's 5 levels higher than your character is your hit chance, spell and melee. I don't know the exact numbers, but you're going to be spending longer trying to kill something that's also going to be doing more damage to you. Granted I didn't make it very far, only to level 8 last night. If I pulled two mobs my level and wasn't ready for it, I pretty much died every time.
---
Fucking asshole.
---
Do people not know about TeamViewer? You can literally control your mouse and keyboard from your phone if you have the app installed.

Welcome to BB! We're happy to have you along for the ride.
---
How do we know it's a persona and not just how they act?
---
Within a few days it'll be business as usual with no queues except maybe at prime time on the biggest servers.  Just pretend the game comes out this weekend instead.
---
God damn. Playing paladin, I have like 3 active dps skills and I'm mostly autoattacking. But it's fun as hell. Currently level 11, first 2 points in holy to get that Conse ASAP.
---
I'm currently at work but when I get back, loch modan awaits.
---
Still, I have to be smart about it and not get addicted :) . I'm going swimming every second day and going to sleep at regular hour.
---
And my mate will be joining me next week :D
---
Bucs went down like this about 4 hours after launch.  We all immediately came back up.  No queue.
---
Nice. Thanks! I'll sniff around.
---
I know for a fact that chatter works.
---
Just don't sell any of your materials early on. Stockpile them in your other characters or bank given that nobody has any gold right now.
---
&gt; my intention was not to slate your addon and just express a concern. I hope that came across correctly :)
---
Absolutely, I would give you a positive review on Whelp!
---
&gt; So it let's me review people I play with and only my friends/guild can see those reviews?
---
It allows you to review anyone you've recently grouped with.  Your friends and guildmates can see those reviews, and only when they're already grouped with the reviewee.*
---
\*Caveat: Right now, Whelp can also get you the reviews written by friends of friends, and friends of friends of friends, and so on.  But, judging by the feedback in this thread, I'm thinking that allowing that "transitivity" is a maybe a bad idea, and it really should just be "friends and guildmates, full stop".  Or maybe being able to filter who for only the reviewers who you find trustworthy would be enough.
---
Either way, _some_ tweak has to be made to Whelp so that people are *only* seeing reviews from sources whose opinions they fully value.
---
lol RIP, oh noo

don't think so

Phone is just faster for silly shit tbh.

Have you any screenshot ? I think we will have to wait a bit before getting the real numbers on websites like twitchmetrics or twitchtrackers.
---
I’m level 12. Got in a little after 9 and quit around 3. Travel time from IF to Tedrassil and just walking around Tedrassil for quests in a less than optimal way really slowed me down haha
---
All those poor e-girl gamer streamers... think of their donations/rentmoney.

I mean theres no real answer except to watch him... watch some non gameplay stuff like classic cast and draw your own opinions. He breaks character often on stream so its pretty obvious, he just gets clipped when hes doing his branded character of being an asshole so twitch chat can laugh at him when he fails

14 on my warlock. Needed a few hours break to eat and get my energy back and now i'm sitting in the queue.
---
Nice I’m a dwarf hunter too :)
---
Exactly. The idea that someone who waits two weeks on a server that currently has queues in the 10s of thousands is  going to end up playing all by himself is ridiculous. Not everyone is rushing to 60. There'll be other people to quest and run dungeons with for months and months.
---
Chads skip the line
---
We’re all in the same boat here haha. Didn’t get past the queue until 9, said I’d only play an hour, played 2.5 and got to bed way too late.
---
Lvl 8
---
He means retail was empty when classic launched
---
My friends had this same issue and their wasn't anything online that helped. It's actually really easy to get it to work. On Blizzard App click on your profile picture and then go to account overview.  Go to games and subscriptions then scroll down and find Starter Edition account. Click on CREATE STARTER ACCOUNT. Follow what it says if it says anything, am not sure. Wow classic should now show in the tab for you.

I think it's time you swallow your ego and stop being entitled. No one knows, even you, how the situation will look 1month or a year from now

I logged in this morning to a Low server. Played for a couple hours, no crowding in starting zones. Ofc last night was going to be madness.
---
Also probably tonight lol.
---
Karma for his stupid red hat
---
Nice man, I remember my first times playing.
---
Maybe don't have kids in the first place if you're going to neglect them idiot? Ever considered that option?
---
are they bind on pickup? You can probably mail them to your lock.
---
Normally I wouldn't suggest this, but friends dont let friends level paladins
---
millennials
---
800x600 is Feeling much more like it anyways
---
Im not sure why people believed them. 
---
When have Blizzard ever not needed downtime after the launch of anything.
---
They'd need maintenance of a new toaster. Theyve always talked that smack.
---
Whats the bet it goes a lot longer then 1hr too. 2-3 im guessing
---
BGS IN A  *CAPITAL CITY*?!?!??!?  
---
boy youre in for a surprise arent ye
---
just kidding my dude, Druids are the best class. Too bad they have meh feral scaling in classic, i would've picked them otherwise since i mained feral in late TBC / Wotlk
---
Your spec won't make much of a difference for a long while (like 40+) - most early talents are stuff like 1% to this and that anyway, only ones that add new skills are noticeable.
---
During Vanilla Varian Wrynn was not present in Stormwind. So Anduin ruled as king with Bolvar and Lady Katrana Prestor as his advisors.
---
You're gonna have a lot of time to play here in about 3 days.  But then all too soon, you're gonna have sleep deprivation and probably have to go back to work.   Good luck.
---
No one clears Mythic on day one in retail.
---
Meanwhile on oceanic there was no queue at all
---
Same, I was on Herod for 12 minutes when the game launched before DCing, though my queue dropped from 17k to 2k after 40 minutes, then I DCed from the queue. Then I logged back in and there was magically no queue and I finally got on.
---
That’s a bummer I had some friends in discord that we’re stuck in que all day too it’s a bummer. I hope you don’t have ques today tho :)
---
My mates who've taken today off work got dc'ed at around 11am, said 130 mins estimated time for them to get back in, but they are still queuing now.. so i'm not confident i'll be online at all this evening!
---
No one would expect you to prot for 5mans at 60, let alone while levelling.
---
20stacks of leather going for 3.5s on AH though...
---
If you hit print screen you can ctrl-v it straight into discord etc
---
well, if i meet someone i enjoyed playing with, i end up adding them. if i add them, we party up, if we party up, we stay in the same shard. and layers go away by the second phase anyway.
---
Yeah for sure. I was actually really disappointed because I wanted to be sober for launch, and with 30 mins til bed time with a 3 hour wait I thought I had no chance so I smoked a good amount. Oh well
---
I get home from work and immediately queue and I get a waiting time of 600minutes.
---
Is it even possible for someone with a full time job to play? In the sense of actually getting in?
---
IDIOT. MORON. JESUS.
---
6 hour queue for 50 minutes of magical gameplay
---
Nah, it wasn't that long, I just got back in.
---
Incendius
---
I played until I was just out of the newbie zone.  It didn't feel much different other than I was wracking up my skill points as I went and I was constantly running around wasting time trying to remember or find where a quest giver was.  By far that was the most annoying because I was wasting my time.  I like playing the game, I don't like when I am told to find something and I can't remember where it was or can't see it and have to spend more time just running in circles.
---
I'm sure it will get better, but last night was just not fun at all.  Despite being in one of the lowest pop servers (Bucs since it's RP and non-PVP), it took forever to get all the kills.  I felt horrible when I tagged a monster (the non-Burly Troggs) away from another player because I knew how annoying it had been for me to find one damn creature alive.
---
It was new, this madness and crowdedness will spread out soon.  But I honestly didn't *feel* any differently than I did at any other point starting WoW.  Other than mentally knowing I'm playing Classic, it didn't strike me as such.
---
While playing, I asked myself if it was all worth it.  If I was feeling just nostalgia or actually enjoying the game as it once was.  I couldn't answer that because I was just in the starter zone.  With time I guess I'll know.
---
Sounds like great advice for real life.

Runescape?

I dunno, although Minecraft is pushed like no tomorrow, I don't actually believe it's the biggest game of all time. I'd like to see hard proof, I imagine there is hard proof out there, I'm just a lazy twat.

Aaaaand I'm back in the game. Only 5 mins downtime

Classic requires very little to run well hardware wise.  The only way you'll know is by installing and seeing if you're happy with how it performs.  If you find it doesn't play good enough, a used Dell Optiplex off eBay combined with a used RX 560 or GTX 1050 would be more than adequate and probably set you back $200.
---
i would pay ridiculous money to see this
---
Layering has nothing to do with server load... layering is how many people can be in 1 layer, that means there wont be 4000 people in the starting area but only 50. Those 4000 get layert in groups of 50.
---
It has nothing to do with how many people can be on a server. If the server can only handel 10k players with ot without layering the queue starts at 10.001.

---
The key is to let the silly randoms rush it first and pull aggro from nearby mobs, then you sneak over and open it while they're stuck fighting them
---
You bet most of these people would be complaining if there were twice the servers, but once the hype died down they were stuck on a "Dead realm" but if Blizz wanted to merge they'd be like #NOCHANGES or some crap
---
Always something, will check asap. Thanks!
---
at one point i was skinning and not able to look hides because of full inventory. so it would leave the body and people would try to skin it.
---
Nice! Your killing it :)
---
&gt;Lol no idea!
---
I was really excited for a new MMO to try after tons of streamers were talking about how it's a great game to play, even if you've never played WoW before. Now, after seeing how elitist and off-putting the community is, I'm not so sure anymore.
---
He has yet to be proven wrong
---
Just got out of work and only 18 min queue on EU Zandalar tribe
---
Well, 300 min is 5 hours 😄 firemaw is like 9 hour queue now. Its just pointless if you got work in the morning
---
All those viewers and 0 people watched my stream last night!
---
Stuff isn't going to sell until people have money to buy it/are leveled high enough to start caring about their profs.  There's zero demand right now and very little money exists to be spent on top of it.
---
Layering was to make it where 800 people weren't trying to kill the same 12 boars in the starting zone. Sharding (which doesnt exist in classic) is what allows Blizzard to throw people in wherever.
---
It's back up!!
---
ah yeah, the context wasn't very clear now that I look at it again
---
Hmmmm, I was wondering why I didn't have any trouble getting in. I guess I was playing the original game not the classic.
---
How'd you avoid the endless upgrade prompts?
---
My friend and I dinged level 10 last night
---
Haha I keep finding stuff and offering it to people, even mailed a recipe to someone's friend last night.
---
If I never have to see asmon's "shocked" face like I'm watching an early 2000s Disney kids TV show overacting... it'll be too soon.
---
Okay, who do you force to change their name? Which server?
---
Probably not for the first few days.
---
yes. warrior class quest sent you there. either for berserker stance or the 2h axe i cant remember
---
Grouping for a quest mob, buffing everyone as you wait, killing it, and then saying "ty for group" brings back a lot of awesome community feels
---
Realms up again!
---
Ever so slightly! 
---
At ~5 hrs per week it'll take between 8-12 months for level 60. Assuming I can stick it out for that long. The toddler is quite demanding, and frankly he prefers trains currently.
---
Won't be getting that tier 3 armor this go-around, haha. At least leveling is it's own enjoyment in vanilla.
---
What realm?
---
You are my hero! Did not know about alt+print screen
---
I'm a little behind, I'm level 17 and my enchanting is 70 my tailoring is 90
---
It really does shine
---
I don’t understand why they don’t spread the pop then merge the servers later....
---
Only to get in and have to spawn camp a single mob to complete a quest
---
Those queue times are from yesterday.
---
If you're considering abandoning your guild for personal gain, instead of trying to find a solution with them and sticking together, I don't think you deserve them.
---
&gt; The community bears some responsibility here. The turbo nerds literally sitting in 7 hour queues are part of the problem. Stop worrying about "status" , man up, and reroll Kromkrush or something.
---
For me, it's not about status. I already compromised by moving off Herod to Blaumeux, but I'm not interested in going to a freshly-opened server. I don't want to end up stuck on a server that has a tiny population once all the people that are just checking things out leave. That's my big fear with the realms they're opening up now.
---
And Blizzard's history with low population realms on retail doesn't give me too much hope that they'll do server merges (or even just the connections they did on retail) for Classic. Maybe they will because they don't care as much about the PR around WoW Classic, but that's not a risk I'm willing to take for something I want to really get into.
---
I'm saying your'e going to wake up one day and lose everything if you play on a pserver no matter which one you pick and no matter how toxic or non-toxic its community is.  It could be a 2 years later or it could be a week.  Pservers die literally overnight for any thinkable reason.
---
you sound like you have no value in money and free time
---
enjoy waiting in line like a product for slaughter for 5 hours
---
To think the Horde could be so 'organized' and polite was the amazing part.
---
I am guessing 400k is real low.  
---
I mean at 5:10 CST, so 10 minutes after launch, I had a 3967 Que on Westfall. A medium population server.  
---
I got in under 20 minutes at that point. The ques only got bigger and logins slowed down a pinch as a few friends logged in later. Ques were 4k+ for both and they made it on in under an hour. I had friends trying to log in at 9pm, so 4 hours later with a que of 4k+. they got in under an hour. On a rough estimate,  
---
4k in que per 30 minutes, Up until 10 pm last night. so 4k x 10. So in a rough estimation from what we saw, we are talking 40k people got in that were in QUE from 5-10 pm on my Medium pop server.  
---
Were there only 10 servers? If I recall, there were a shitload, and EU went down entirely.
---
Is there any way to see my character online similar to this but for classic? https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/aerie-peak/xo
---
They were just trying to deliver the authentic experience.  Unfortunately, it sounds like their quality of service was too good since some players were able to connect and play on the first night.
---
Your Reddit karma.
---
One thing I noticed last night was that Stormwind was completely empty when I was turning in some low level quests. 
---
Is this a known layering bug???
---
Is this about the cockroach on the wall that he killed 3 years ago?
---
Welcome to the past.
---
Looks like Questie
---
server transfers are confirmed but there is currently no ETA on the service being live
---
After ruling for his father for several years, he should be more experienced. LOL
---
And Brack was fired instead of promoted and Blizz employees got profit sharing instead of shot down in flames and it lessened global wealth inequality by a smidge. And everyone went home happy.
---
Lol I know right
---
I tried this twice yesterday and kept getting kicked due to some error. But its in the interface menu and its a drop down. I found it but was unable to actually get my game to run in windowed mode.
---
Thanks everyone! I found the solution!
---
Had bodies on repeat last night
---
I have a premade group of ~25 people on Herod all with different starting times. It's set in stone for us lol.
---
Did you go up the queue? Lol
---
Got way to excited about hitting 10, joined a guild that's actually really nice, and already made some cool friends, I'd call that a success

This is the dumbest post ever.  Almost ALL of the issues people have with Layering are long term.  No one said layering is going to make you hate the game day 1.  Also, no one who was anti-layering suggested having so few servers.  If there wasn't Layering, you'd see 10 times as many servers, and you'd be able to pick one that didn't have a queue.
---
Also, for the record, people are already abusing Layering to level and avoid crowds, and obviously massive queues still exist.
---
Yeah, moved to Razorgore after already losing my names twice. Now i am still in a huge queue. Pathetic tbh... This is not some f2p game.
---
1 to 10 requires 27600 xp. Mobs at this range give around 70 xp. 
---
50 to 60 requires 1778600 xp. Mobs giving around 320 xp.
---
Xp from mobs scales worse and worse the higher you are. In short, it'll take awhile.
---
Oh shit that's my ex's brother...
---
Hold on I have the exact same keyboard that you do.
---
Is your blizzard launcher up to date? Have also read of others who close all instances of the launcher in task manager and re-open.
---
My daughter arrived a few days before the classic beta, I had so much time to play just by volunteering the night shift. My first (only?) silver was a post I made for how to be a new dad and still play fine. 
---
But alas at this moment between work and baby routines I only had enough time to watch my time in queue go from 25000 to 11000 and off to bed I went.
---
But I did get a nice treat in the form of seeing asmongold get dcd just before I went to bed lol.
---
You're in for a suprise...
---
Yeah, it's pretty cool when things like this happens. I'm leveling a shaman and sometimes I stumbled upon people in trouble, so I threw some heals on them and helped them finish the job.
---
Not true? Happened to me twice, and happened to several of my guild mates. 
---
Thats not even counting the plethora of complains on the blizzard forums. 
---
I got right back in after getting kicked this morning, but that’s 1/3. 
---
Thanks for calling me a liar for expressing my thoughts.
---
Suffer
---
I leveled skinning so fast in Mulgore...no one was skinning lol
---
Mirage raceway EU
---
I believe they get updated periodically, but you are correct that they will be different from yesterday.

Lmfao! When you're still stuck on the fad complain train and everyone else has moved on.

I guess Blizzard actually did something right... OMG did he just say that.... Lmfao.
---
Got me hyped that US survivor was on again but....just you aussies having your go.

Nothing aside from the playerbase

Technically you could but it wouldnt be very easy on a phone. I used to use it to open my Mythic + chests from work during Legion

I named my guild: Relapse

---
Which one? I'll have to install it
---
This guy is a prime example of why tech bros should not be in leadership positions.
---
Not only that but servers in general have a better time if they can make compartments. Look at it this way:
---
Let's say you have 10 people playing. So the server has to account for 10 people interacting with each other. So every person has 9 interactions. If you add 1 person now instead of 10 people having 9 interactions(90 total) it is 11 people having 10 interactions (110 total) add 1 more and you have 12 people with each 11 interactions (132 total). Now you see from 10 to 11 you get 20 more interactions and from 11-12 22more. Although the absolute amount of people playing is only increased by one the burden on the server was increased more when there were more people on the server. So if the server can split you up over multiple compartments that don't interact it can drastically lower the interactions needed and allow more people on the same hardware.
---
It is of course more complex in reality but this is probably the basic idea. The side benefit is that players also have more breathing room during high load peaks such as launches.
---
Impressive. But why ?
---
Zug zug
---
Yep zame, Razorgore EU didn't have a queue either last night.
---
Just imagine how much energy is wasted by people staring at the log in screen at 144 fps. I turned on the option that the game only runs at 8 fps in background.
---
I just think the capital cities were pretty barren because everyone was out leveling. Even a /who only showed a few people in the cities for me.
---
Don’t you mean [Art Vandaley ?](https://images.app.goo.gl/cGgHX6sr9YMigf7v6)

/10hqueue
---
Re-download the client, it didn't show for me until my battle.net client updated
---
On NA servers are classified as East Coast or West Coast.  On EU, I believe national communities have declared they are rolling on specific servers.  There's a blizzard forum post somewhere and I think there's a running list you can find with this information.
---
I want to be in this community.... What server?  What faction? 
---
😆😆😆😆😆
---
Every... single... paragraph you typed is exactly my point.
---
It's one big whine; **change servers**. You were warned by them beforehand.
---
but the moire adds artistic depth
---
jesus christ lmao
---
FYI - old blanchy has zero queue right now. You get in instantly.
---
&gt;Either switch to a different server
---
Queues on every server, even medium pops...
---
I don't remember it this way... but I probably never grabbed skinning and went back to the &lt; 5 lvl area... but it seemed like in Deathknell (&lt; 5) I couldn't skin beasts, but once I was out of there things were all good.
---
Maybe he is from r/soccer. They have a thing for bald guys.
---
I didn't know sheep's speak Norwegian. They also speak spanish apparently. "Bae."
---
Besides the que times (caused by too few servers during make reservation, everybody wants to play with their friends on one of big servers) this was a phenomenal launch. The first 30 minutes had awful lag but once that smoothed out it was pretty much flawless. Super impressed by Blizz right now.
---
both, at the same time
---
Never seen that before. Thats crazy!
---
Why the rush, just enjoy the game... but that's just my humble opinion
---
And before that he was above 100k+ viewers. Sure that’s great but he could have been making double and getting a lot new faces into the stream which is more in the long run. Obviously he’s fine but damn that sucks.
---
As a father of 2 youngest at almost 2 years old... enjoy the first 6 months of classic because after that shits gunna hit the fan! Only really just got back I to gaming casualy.
---
The window for an acceptable solution to the problem closed a few days ago when they refused to release new servers before launch. Now the only solution is to release more servers to keep up with demand and have disgruntled players switch realms or sit around for four hours waiting for a queue to pop.
---
The bois!
---
cause its low pop, i just got on faerlina now and it seemed so packed and so much ppls, and I went back on kirtonos and its like no one around..... idk what to do man....
---
If it was after about 10 at night my mother wouldn’t even knock on my bedroom door. Just bust in like “WHAT are you doing??” I never stood a chance, but I still managed to finish MC raids
---
Location.
---
Look up the which [server list](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/wow-classic-servers/) is closer to you.
---
One good thing is that it appears that when you're in the queue it does actually keep your place.  I got to about 300ish and DC'd and then when I reconnected it put me back in at 300.
---
"Why do I see a nightsaber on track humanoid?"  
---
Oh.
---
Not as much as it used to, but wouldn’t hurt, that’s for sure.
---
the thing is, there is no low pop server for Germans, for example. They just didn't give enough servers. They themselves said that servers these days are way bigger than they were in Classic so a half full server would still feel fuller than a full server in original classic back in the days. And we have over 30k people in queue on the two German pvp servers alone. More on pve servers.
---
You can't tell me there would be a population problem in a few months if they made a bunch of additional servers...

As a father of 2 girls under 3 I recommend chrome Remote Desktop, also get a monitor that has an app for your phone then run some kind of emulator like blue stacks to install the camera/monitor app on your desktop and pull it up on a second screen, it saves you from having to do the whole 1 headphone on your ear 1 off so you can listen.

it runs on my wifes 2012 macbook, so probably?
---
My wife and I were able to beat the queue on Fairbanks, but the rest of my friends and acquaintances have been hopping servers like mad. Now we're all scattered about. I hope for their sake the servers they've migrated to actually last.
---
I believe you have to download the classic version of the game from the battle bet menu but I’m not 100% sure

Weird. Maybe that was it, but when I was running through the main gates people were always running out but when I got inside it was a ghost town.

woah there

So blizzard kind of announced a long time ago that even Medium realms will see ques, and if a lot of people on lows try to log in, there could also be queues...
---
The difference is that by moving realms your experiencing far shorter queues...
---
They had server transfers in vanilla so I would assume they'd have them in classic as well if things get bad.
---
Bunch of criers in this thread lol, he/she pays for the game, one person isn't ruining your Classic WoW experience.
---
Should have taking a pic of your keyboard with your phone
---
Once you're in the game go to your video settings...
---
Well I mean, they could give them higher prio, that's possible, not that they are but they could. Ypu could look at GTA RP servers for example. Some people have special flags on their accounts that give them a higher priority.
---
Again not that blizzard is doing it, but they absolutely could.
---
I have a friend like this, he is only playing classic because every other friend is playing classic. He is the only one still playing the WoW at all. He does make good points about how encounters are more complex and take more skill and he is a part of a major mythic raiding guild. But this also means he has a core group that play together online which is what most of us miss with classic but for him he still has that.
---
I logged off Firemaw to sleep 6 hours ago. Stupid me should have just immediately re queued.
---
No, do not be worried.  The word around here is that all of these population counts are relative to the largest population
---
If anyone was wondering, there's a setting to make the quest text instant in the base game. Search a bit in Interface Options and you'll find it.
---

Watched him tell a story about him and his old guild and he sounded like a complete dick
---
It's only one night of progress is the grand scheme of the game &lt;3
---
I hate Trump but occasionally MAGA trolled on pserver chats. I also trolled for every other political ideology under the sun. For example, I once got in an extended argument about whether WoW was an anime.
---
The zergling, obviously.
---
I am declaring WAR.
---
Yes. 100%
---
Its a completely different network. It will have to reconnect.
---
You just need to believe and anything is possible!
---
Mom! Bathroom!
---
No chance...
---
Atiesh did this, saw it with my own eyes.
---
7 hours then DCed. a little after midnight ( no thought do iv heard worse stories all night) log back in and find I’m in 3 hour que and fall asleep around 2am *facepalm* WHITEMANE IS STRONG
---
I hope so, but I'm just trying to be a realist.
---
How ironic this post is. Everyone else is essentially saying "me me me" in this thread.
---
They don’t want to put themselves in a situation where there’s too many players on a server to eventually not be able to remove layering
---
Tbh he probably should be shamed though
---
Which server is this?
---
Pick up quest, see around on side of mini map, start running...realize it's telling me there are towns nearby. /quit
---
I have a hunter, and damn was I having trouble with mobs, still am at lvl 7, but I am slowly getting better gear, and silver (skinning+leatherworking) nice to get almost 2 silver per piece I craft, I almost hit 20 silver before I went to get the new professions stuff I needed as well as class spells. Having fun, although I learned the hard way that I shouldn't of logged out in the middle of the wendigo cave, it was filled with people last night so I could easily move about it, it was a pain to work my way out of it (4-5 death walks I think). Still fun :)
---
Dude, this is classic.
---
I only have Wow1 on the dropdown :(
---
R5 2600 1050ti here. 150-200 fps on 1080p high. Sonething wrong with your game :)
---
World of queuecraft.
---
I'd almost prefer they just hide the estimate. There's no great way to predict when someone is going to logoff or get randomly disconnected. Your position also matters. At 16k, you get a lot of people stepping out of line because they have better shit to do. Once you get lower in line, sub 1,000, some people are more likely to dig in. And once players get in after waiting 6+ hours, they obviously wanna stay on as long as they can
---
this is hilarious
---
I think that was everywhere. Deathknell was nearly unplayable for hours even on the servers Blizz released after launch.
---
America is less than 400 mil, not close to 600
---
You mean the queue simulator? I can't imagine how awful it must be to miss out on this fun experience.
---
Ah yes. I logged in 5 hours after launch and had a 3 hour queue. Good times
---
but not the same spawn
---
which you might as well just vendor most cases... bare bottom prices waiting to get scooped up by someone willing to put in the grind to save them and sell them for more reasonable prices.
---
I noticed a FPS limiter in the video settings mine was set at 100 foreground and 30 background even though I’m on 10
---
Offering refunds for what? The $15 subscription you paid?
---
Ha I rolled this dice about an hour and a half ago - apparently my server went down since then haha. good luck!
---
Yahoo finance has WoW Classic guides? What the heck lol
---
Blizz has also said that low pop in Classic is fairly equal to high pop in actual Vanilla WoW. So even low is a lot of players.
---
Server: Atiesh
---
Douchebag: Plagueworks
---
been in queue for 7-8 hours, currently 413
---
I know it's exciting. 
---
There were add-ons in vanilla my dude
---
Lol? Elvui is working on vanilla?
---
Also my exact reaction lol
---
because this is how some people enjoy the game .. is that really so hard to understand?
---
I'll save you both the trouble, it'll still be fucked!
---
I was there 23:59 cet, *26th* of august.
---
Im not sure I know what you mean. What do you mean by sub, and everything on the account?
---
Because they're going to phase layering out. They don't want it to be a permanent solution.
---
Chasracter specific keybinds?
---
think of it like how old people watch a lot of TV
---
the new generation TV's are streamers
---
Yeah i agree, more layers would be nice.
---
I loved seeing this. Yeah, most realms were respectful like this which was awesome. Some people ignored the line but only a few. Great to see.
---
I've made so much money so far its incredible. Amazing how a single gold at lvl 10 makes you feel like a king
---
Same boat here, but we have decided to take it easy for 3-4 days
---
Slowly.  They want to avoid the issue of eventually having empty servers and players asking them to add character transfers, so they won't add more servers than they think they can fill long-term.
---
Launch too many servers...merge the lower populations later.
---
Better idea than having most of the players unable to play the game
---
Thanks for this, was looking for something earlier today.
---
Demand them back.
---
Ive had a grace period when it's happened to me? It seems random.
---
It’s the same reason people like athletes like Conor mcgregor and Floyd. They’re characters who aim to entertain.
---
Its day 1 of a 30 day sub. Sure they can refund your .50 cents
---
If you take seconds to rejoin, you should be ok (I actually turned the game off/on with intent on going to the back of que, but remained in same position). 
---
However it could be connected to your IP and not just bnet account, so I can't guarantee it will work even if the swap happens in a couple of seconds.
---

---
Sounds like Fury might be right up your alley, RichWPX.

---
I've had to do a lot of reading on classed and etc as I was introduced to the game in '09. I've read that warrior leveling is miserable, but so powerful at 60 with the gear scale. I vote warrior!
---
I'm actually glad that i'm on holiday now ;)
---
agreed. but we are far far away from that now. It's funny how classic now feels "way harsh" compared to everything available now...except maybe Eve Online, but even that game has gotten much easier over time.
---
The point is that it doesn't matter if they keep adding servers if people refuse to leave the mega servers.
---
right: "Only 13k?! Real servers have 20k queues!"
---
you can probably get a refund for the sub you paid but they would also remove your sub so you can't play wow
---
not worth it
---
I stayed logged into the queue longer than I will stay on BFA so..yeah.
---
Yeah I'm not sure if the queue is worse now that I'm home from work, or better
---
On the bright side, in phase 2 we lose layering, the queues will change.
---
Rouge
---
22.5k people in queue, 13mins? that's some high speed disconnecting that people are experiencing
---
Gotcha. Will take that one off of my list lol
---
Celsius, my American friend.
---
Fam - i was 10 mins from playing and had to sit in for 6hrs listening to all of my friends playing. 
---
Got on at midnight, played until 0200 AM. I'm dead at work rn.
---
You're a tool, vanilla wasn't that hard and now that any random noob can min-max it's going to be a joke. Come back to reality, it's not 2006.

Joana is an old speedrunner he should be high 20s now
---
germany here, my oceanic and korean friends.
---
We got 2 more servers but all are full anyway and I wait on my PVP realm for 6 hours now. but I will be able to play in 1 hour so .... yay.
---
Which shows they were not ready for the amount of people interested...even though everyone knew they didn't have enough servers
---
Lol Rouges
---
Within like 30 minutes westfall was totally playable just fyi. The launch lag didnt stick around long
---
That's actually really funny definitely trying this tomorrow
---
The AH is located in Ironforge for Alliance and Orgrimmar for Horde. You should look into the price of almost any white(common) or better item. If you use the addon auctioneer it can scan the AH(similar to ebay) and save the price of every item so you can know how much items in your bags are worth. Crafting materials such as leather, ore/bars, herbs are all good to sell as well as items that are green(uncommon) or better. I would recommend trying out auctioneer to make sure you price things correctly.
---
I’d want to skip the line but I’d be worried that shit would backfire when i was looking for a guild lol
---
A lot obviously are leaving or there wouldn't be queues on brand new servers already
---
I just got flashbacks
---
Another picture of a lien thanks for your post really interesting
---
&gt; Every time ~~I log off it~~ disconnect it disappears.
---
Try actually exiting the game to save them. Dc's will reset them.
---
A fews hours ago I was having some trouble fighting mobs as a shammy in a cave in mulgore. A party of two taurens, a warrior and a druid, saw me almost dying and decided to help me. After we killed them, I opened a nearby chest, which had 3 potions and a few herbs. I told them the warrior needed the potion the most, so I gave it to him. I also didn't loot the herbs because I thought the druid maybe would want it.
---
They thanked me and after that, we cleared the entire cave together and had a blast while doing it. 
---
Now I'm starting to get why people love classic so much.
---
You want to move with WASD on the keyboard and strafe with q and e.  You can learn to just rest your hand there.  Use the mouse to move the camera.  
---
Turn on all your aciton bars and put everything on an action bar.   Your professions, fishing etc, you can put off to the side on the right and use the mouse to click on those.  
---
But look at your left hand on WASD and notice all the keys you can easily press with your left hand while on WASD.  You can easily press Shift, and Ctrl.  Alt is kind of awkward to hit while keeping your thumb on space so you can jump out of stuff (fire etc).  You can easily press 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  6 is doable but is a little out of the way for me.  
---
So I put all my core abilities on 1 through 5 and again with alt and ctrl modifiers via key bindings.  So my main action bar is 1 through 5, then right above it is ctrl + 1 through 5.  
---
Now with the shift modifier, I actually use letter keys near my left hand.  
---
Shift + (Q, W, E, R, T, A, S, D, F, G, Z, X, C, V)    
---
Alt's harder to press, Alt and Ctrl are hard to press so on Ctrl and Alt 1 through 5 I only put specials/racials etc up there, things with longer cool downs I don't need to cast a lot.  
---
My Taunt is Shift + E on every character I play with a taunt so it's the same on every toon, etc.  
---
Then you use your mouse for moving the camera and adjusting direction and clicking on adds, bosses, other players etc.  (Unless you're a healer etc, then you'd use the mouse to click on raid frames of people you want to heal).
---
The only settings that drop my FPS down to nothing are MSAA 8x8 or 8x16 and Multi-sample Alpha Test. The latter I don't care about it doesn;t change anything from my perspective.   
---
dropping from 8x MSAA 1440 in retail to 4x MSAA at 1080 in classic is atrocious.
---
You're right, I'm not denying that at all. Everyone's time is getting wasted. And yes, everyone should've absolutely predicted that. It's just that it's not our fault at all. I remade my characters on Morgraine yesterday when it freshly opened after already moving off of Shazzrah to Firemaw, like Blizz recommended. Still in a 10k queue.
---
I'm just nitpicking lmao
---
Wrong game
---
[Curious...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/330/819/e47.png)
---
I can't upvote this hard enough.   There is no progression here, it's a classic server.    Take your time and live in it.
---
Hah I live next to my work so you know I'm running home and getting in that queue so by the time I'm out I'm good. But yeah it's pretty brutal.
---
Holy crap I started at 6k and thought that was bad
---
Yea man fuck that guy.
---
It's like fishing IRL.
---
"Remember when you had to spam casting a rod to get fish? You don't wanna do that. Now you just go to an online grocery store and push a button."
---
Shit now I just realized what I should do during work lol
---
Just fish for hours
---
lmao pvp servers
---
Similar feelings, sure.  I'm talking about time available.  Being 35 at launch might be the most ideal range in that potential kids might be old enough to be gone or at least out and about without constant attention and care.
---
But someone in their 20s back then are most likely not going to be able to spend the same amount of time if marriage and kids are now involved.
---
High school would also be terrible.  If they started in 04 as a sophomore, they sure aren't in high school now.  Now they would be working, have obligations they didn't before.  It is just how things go.
---
I don’t have that on my keyboard actually
---
Glad to hear!
---
Rip Datmodz too
---
I'm ready for the downvotes, but honestly, I wouldn't mind if they added quest **start** locations to the minimap, just so it was harder to miss questgivers. I understand the slippery slope #nochanges arguments against doing so, though, and am perfectly content just using Questie instead.
---
i used greenshot for this, turns print screen button into windowskey+shift+s
---
I definitely profited massively off this outside the Wendigo Cave as a dwarf lvl 4. Noone had skinning. Could do this about an hour and a half until someone said in general chat this exact strategy. Now everyone is doing this. Sadface
---
Meanwhile I’m over here trying to grab a peace bloom, I aggro a scorpid halfway through and some dick ass runs up and steals it before I can finish killing said scorpid. 
---
Is there a server all you chill people ended up on?  Cuz Fairbanks is full of mud gobblers.
---
Can I play on US servers from EU
---
Yeah kept running into the same people all night it was cool. Bubbles the orc warrior is a cool dude lol.
---
There was a scheduled server maintenance today, forget what time tho.
---
We did this on Bloodsail Buccaneers last night!  I think the line while I was there was 100 people (most in groups of five).
---
Oh. Maybe that queue was too long. Didn't read that correctly lmao
---
You wanted the vanilla classic experience, that's how you played the game back then.
---
Well everyone subbed so it is a win for them. They pbly dont care about Queues...
---
Do the same for NA, interesting numbers.
---
what do you call "1440p" max?
---
because 1440p max is 8k downsampled to 1440p plus msaax8
---
Honestly, I leveled as a tauren and Mulgore was no issue at ALL to level at launch. Post level 1 was ez sailing as an initial player with the rush. I was surprised how few taurens there were.
---
Have you forgotten about WoD launch? Because that was a shitshow to behold
---
It was stable. I played 6.5 hours straight, not a single hiccup.
---
Not necessarily because if it happened on live I could’ve just soloed everything. All the friends were made out of necessity of getting something done
---
My brother and I are doing the exact same thing :)
---
ShareX is open-source and does that and more.
---
So.... Are of you actually playing? How is it?  My plan is to wait a week or two and then start so I can avoid the worst of the bullshit.
---
Others don't seem to be having the same issue, though.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Speaking of other famous people, does anyone know what server Andrew Luck is gonna start his professional streaming career on?
---
Yup.
---
I know how to use print screen, but my friend does not since he is the one who sent this to me.
---
Ikr. I just wish this was a reveal trailer instead of launch
---
They did the same on Stalagg yesterday, at exactly 11PM (it's just after 11AM EST now), so this might not be a coincidence and they simply empty servers every 12 hours to give everyone a chance to play...?
---
I'm not saying it's the case, but it seems like a big coincidence that entire servers would "mass boot" people at exactly 11:00.
---
Yeah this is making me question everything.  I've just decided to move to a med pop server because the population in queues is madness. About 150k EU English so they'll eventually decide to the same and we will have about 10 high pop servers
---
What does that look like in written in the addon?
---
did you go through, to make sure they didnt fuck up and add tbc to the game too
---
🦀hide estimated que times🦀
---
Just from an IT perspective it makes sense. You'd much rather have to solve the issue of accommodating too many people (which is usually solved by throwing money around) than the reverse.
---
we had several large guilds transfer (for free) from their full server to our lower pop server in vanilla
---
Not on Classic you can't.
---
Yeah I woke up early and got on without too much trouble, got a random server DC a little later and have been in a 4 hour queue since.
---
I'm on golemagg, it happened to me too, it went down a thousand places after 10 minutes but been stuck again for like 20. It seems to me neither the queue position nor the estimated time matters.
---
So true, i've been at 8 min left, for the last 11 min.
---
Your last sentence is literally what you tried to tell people here don't do. If you just dislike something that's your thing, but the hate train cirklejerk is bullying.
---
the dc was for like 5 seconds, wasn't maintenance

---
No queues for me but the first 10 mins at Northshire Abby will always give me nightmares now. The pure slaughter of wolves and kobalds. The screams as thousands descended on the Abby in a murderous chaotic rage unlike anything I’ve seen before.
---
A lot of them are, in my opinion, well intentioned changes that ultimately chipped away at what made the experience special. Removing the necessity of close knit player groups, expanding server population to cross realms so nobody has a reputation, removing the adventure/pain in the ass of actually traveling in the world instead of teleportation. I could go on forever.
---
Same...then i got back in after a couple hours....on to get dced again...did make it to lvl 6 though so got that going for me.
---
There literally wasn't. I actually have a screenshot from basically that exact time showing skeram at medium
---
Blizzard surely didn't expect these queue times and it's appreciated that they added more servers, the only thing that bothers me at the moment is what happens when a percentage of the playerbase stop playing(and they will) and some realms will be left barren or with few people
---
I got disconnected twice while waiting in the queue last night.  I cant recall the time frames, but I thought they were around \~30min.  The third time I queued, it just queued indefinitely until I got in.
---
Are you sure about this?  Thanks.
---
We got at home exactly what we wanted.
---
Done that in a dungeon before for sure. Super hungover or something and just pass out on the W and face pull a room
---
Now that we've gone through launch...  Asmon, probably the biggest wow streamer, sat in a 20k queue.
---
So, there isn't one.
---
You should start que when you leave and log in by the time u get home
---
200-300 probably
---
That's an awesome name.
---
I am just so happy that I can go over to a quest area, see a group of people doing the quest I'm on, and ask to join their group to knock out the quest together. It's shocking how terrible retail looks compared to Classic.
---
Good to know. I was estimating when I joined at 12k firemaw and ended up staying until 4k; was 2k an hour consistently.
---
I love this, I have watched it at least 6 times now, and I will watch it more when I get home from work.
---
I'm not spanish, but why doesn't EUROPE have spanish servers? Pretty obvious there's a community big enough.
---
it boots people off when a layer closes/collapses
---
Which one? I have a screenshot from 8am showing not a single high
---
Moved back in with the parents. Help them out with bills while I go to school full time. 
---
Really sucks to move back, but not having to deal with rent or other bills helps. Can't wait to be done and move out again though.
---
Why do we want this?
---
That's just pure evil.
---
Great stuff! Will see you Later! The queue is so damn long on firemaw
---
Mate its 20k plus now on every EU English high pop...
---
Can you recommend one?
---
Yeah, I believe you’re right honestly. A lot could happen to change people’s lives in 15 years, and that’s if you can somehow manage to even bring the old guild back together at all.
---
It’s time to make new bonds. My retail guild isn’t playing classic, so I’ll be in the same boat as a lot of people and trying to find a new community.
---
That's terrible, and what about guild names?
---
Happened to me too, I was 317th in line. Never had that happen before to *purchase* a blizz game.
---
Damn Ashbringer sounds so good might have to reroll to that is it PST tho?
---
My bad, I’m sure streamers like Kaceytron and Legendary Lea will be raiding MC in a few weeks.
---
🦀Still no Authenticator delay🦀
---
If I'm on the east coast, will there be a noticable difference in latency between a Pacific and Eastern server?
---
Me too. I made several new friends in only 13 levels. Playing a priest is great. Buffing people and getting buffed back, /cheered at, or stopped to ask a question about a quest was a lot of fun. And crawling through my first RFC was a hell of a lot of fun too.
---
Always read the quests. There’s lots of interesting stories/lore hidden within them!
---
Bullying is a word used by children with thin skin. Realize that not everyone has the same opinions and values as you do and that’s okay.
---
Thanks for your comment, really useful.
---
WoD was my first launch since I came in MoP....shudder.
---
Flamelash also had it, queue master was two gnomes and a hairless dwarf
---
Sulfuras. If I have to leave later or it merges then whatever.
---
raizQT is level 22 warlock

---
Not every realm has a queue of 600 minutes. Switching realms isn't always the answer but it could help. They brought up \~12 new realms yesterday. I was going to roll on an overpopulated server but audibled into Incendius and was able to get in with no queue. (I realize it had one last night and probably has one now)
---
You can play there was 3 low pop realms with no que last night.
---
#Community
---
Yah,  Run to stormwind -&gt; tram to Iron forge -&gt; Menathal harbor skip -&gt; boat the darkshore -&gt; swim in the ocean to Silithus
---
or
---
Run to  West Fall Ocean -&gt; swim to booty bay -&gt; boat to Ratchet -&gt; Swim to Silithus
---
Then drown and spirit rezz in Silithus proper, would be my guess.
---
The best part is, once you install the addons, you can use the Twitch desktop app to auto update you addons instead of manually doing so.
---
Welcome to vanilla my friend, the only time they refunded anything back then was when the servers completely shut down.
---
Thanks but my last exam for this year is Monday so basically I'm waiting for it to pass.
---
We e did this in Durotar for some quests.
---
If the servers were down period, still probably not, but maybe.
---
The servers are working, they are just packed.  As far as Blizzard is concerned, you aren't unable to play, you are just impatient.
---
Where did you do it? i did it on the spot i used to do it back then, but it didnt work?
---
thats classic bro. Make sure you have mount money @ 40.
---
Combine the two and you get QQ
---
Don't have to be at your pc, I just went afk for a shower and other stuff for just over an hour and I'm still in queue (7000-&gt;3300) Razorgore EU
---
Guess what boyo. You're gonna be waiting no matter where you go.
---
What if you are playing on a 60% keyboard?
---
Just wait until you encounter the pillagers ^^
---
Maybe go somewhere else?
---
A few things I remembered last night for the first time since I last played Vanilla that really turned me away:
---
1. Lack of money to buy a vendor gear even when I do all the quests and fill my inventory each time and sell all.
---
2. Running in circles in a region for close to an hour trying to find something
---
3. Spending 2-3x as long in the starter zone than was necessary because of the insanity numbers even on the only RP server
---
4. Knowing that the majority, if all, of my guild mates from before are 12-15 years older and most likely will not rejoin as before
---
I don't know what I was expecting.  I wasn't as excited as others, I guess, because I remembered the grinds for reputation, the endless running from one point to another (back then when it came out, I always called this game a Time Sink so we'd spend more time on it and Bliz would get more money).  Despite that I played it last night, and I am hoping for some kind of a spark of enjoyment from the game.  But right now I just don't feel the same way I did 15 years ago.
---
To me, it feels like going to Vegas for the 10th time.  It's neat to see the sights but I'm not as mystified as I was the first time or two.
---
It means that the estimate is not actually accurate.
---
Just remember the 90s when your windows would update and itd say 134 days left. Maybe itll be ready in 2 minutes, or 5 minutes, or a week. One would never know.
---
Point is is that the estimate probably has no fucking idea lol
---
Just like getting wasted by a mob
---
Upvote for fellow horde on Bloodsail Buccaneer!
---
It ain’t great either being the only priest in a 20 man, and having to do Fort AND Spirit :/ It takes about 4 minutes each wipe.
---
They should perform mergers at the very least. So many of these realms will be ghost towns in no less than a month, let's be real.
---
Try TBag, installed that last night and it's been working pretty well with Classic. Also Leatrix+ for alot of automation stuff with quests, vendoring, repairs.
---
No you dont lose anything you just have to run back to your corpse
---
Isn't there an issue with dead targets if you don't put exists though or something like that? I've had to add exists at some point because I was running into some issue
---
Yea, the best game there is has a feature where you have to wait to play it
---
Right when you capped fishing at 75!
---
People twink at level 10?
---
Rppvp is the most fun. Cuz it has all the pro’s of pvp server and all the pro’s of rp server. So its hilarious shit
---
yojamba did have a queue, over 3k when i checked
---
hate PSA crap but this guy is right but hes an enemy.
---
Welcome to classic, bitch.
---
It will be just fine.  You have hundreds of thousands queueing PLUS all the people in layers that will eventually be removed.
---
They do. They're called layers.
---
first, I wouldnt. 
---
second: the reason wouldn't be the quest - its the behavior. I wouldnt want to play with a selfish person that can't follow basic established courtesy, no. but thats why I have a friendly guild =D
---
now if I ran into a line cutter a zone later and he was all OMG CAN YOU HALP ME? I wouldnt help that person fwiw.
---
Pfffft
---
i think it's because everyone is still in the beginning zones, not everyone got to Stormwind yet
---
Are the queues still pretty bad right now?
---
Jokes on them. I logged into my server 40mins early to make sure i could play when the enter world button lit up.
---
Same, I saved am almost dead warrior yesterday on my druid, then buffed him up. Also random passersby buffing you is the best.

What the fuck are you talking about? They’ve been urging people to spread out since name reservation went live. They’ve been telling us for weeks that the big servers could have 10000+ person queues
---
British servers?
---
That's not true. Logouts are a lot slower at the start when players first get in and plan on playing until bed. Whereas logouts speed up a lot around 11PM as people start to get tired and go to bed.
---
Whats a recommended populated pve US east server (can you recommend one for horde and one for alliance please) with a decent population but low que time. I don't mind waiting a few minutes (15 at most) even if i disconnect and have to que again. I would like to play on the populated servers as i like seeing more players around, but the long que times aren't worth it for me. Might start subscription on Friday
---
Not on [Blizzard.com](https://Blizzard.com) though :S strange.
---
Had some pretty close situations in Fargo deep mine with a fellow mage.
---
Bruh. Even in 3 months the starting zones will be populated.
---
This is literally layering and it already exists.

It's not the time they think you will get into the game, it's their estimate of your willpower to stay in the queue ;D

Thanks I'll try googling it! Personally I would like it to stay at classic, I've played TBC all the way through MoP
---
Got on Skeram this morning at 7:30 AM with no queue
---
This is how layering works...
---
Hey man don't worry I thought it was Levar Burton.
---
20 minutes earlier the Q was at 1819
---
Now it is at 1809
---
"Estimated time": 2 minutes
---
IDK how to make worse predictions
---
Careful dude. The doomsayers will downvote you for this.
---
Famous last words before game crash
---
Same. I think after everyone woke up they've been bailing on the full servers in thousands. Maybe it takes a minute for it to update it's listing.
---
And you’ve ruined it
---
Maybe thats before you added help? Help should already add exists
---
Which race is best for playing Rogue?
---
Oh nvm then, I must have been lucky with my login times then as the longest q I had was 150 people.
---
Noone, bought it online
---
Got home, instantly got in. Played for an hour and logged out to take my wife to work now, logged in to see if there's a queue. 5k... 2 hours... amazing.
---
You'd probably be right. Had a quest chain that led there. I suspect corpse running Westfall was a ye olde noob mistake :P
---
Absolutely love actually having somewhat difficult world levelling content. Like playing a whole new WoW.
---
Same, got a random DC at 12, been in queue since
---
Can confirm sit in a 10k queue or a 3k queue. Both are less than &lt;1min queues... atleast according to the wow servers.
---
I’m being ultra nice to everyone on my server, it’s just step 1 in attaining ultimate power of my server
---
Not to disregard your friends queue 
---
But 2 hrs after launch queue (5pm pst) had me at a 90min ish queue 
---
So just depends on the timing I suppose but compared to the other servers that ain’t much really
---
Indeed - I wish my guild WAITED to pick a server (no reason to pick a server pre launch except selfish name res) but since they didnt it is what it is. No way im uprooting 100 people to a new server. roflmao.
---
just skin what you kill and vendor the skins. it racks up silver really nicely.
---
Trying to play on lsd
---
thanks man! I will give TBag a try.
---
Do you like Leatrix+, I haven't looked into it too much but is it fairly customizable or does it just always sell all grays and always repair?
---
Humans get a spirit bump, which is helpful for priests.
---
An equally geared human will always be a slightly better at healing than a dwarf. The dwarf’s benefit is an extra raid utility (that’s situational as not all raid/dungeon encounters incorporate a fear component).
---
Get sapped then die
---
got problem cuz its for plebs
---
Agreed. I figured if I paid for a subscription I could play the game...I guess not.
---
They may even threaten with an unsub.
---
I grouped for the journal quest in Coldridge Valley, and everyone got the journal when we killed the troll. Not sure if that's the same as collecting X bandanas, though.
---
So I bought a bunch of hardware to build a new PC since my old one died last week and have spent the last 3 days trying to get it set up unsuccessfully. Blue ballllllllllllllled real hard.
---
What happened to Mograine? It seemed so promising with a moderate population.
---
vendoring is the way to go
---
So, the closer the number of players in the queue approaches 0, the more time it takes to get in the game?
---
I'm not sure you understand how graphs work.
---
I'll give you an honest answer instead of just yelling at you. (Even though this is stupid as shit lol)
---
You can probably cancel your subscription right now and get a refund. That's you canceling everything though and not being able to try and play. If the queues are too long and you're not digging it, there's a CHANCE you can get a refund since you purchased it so recently.
---
Blizzard is not going to refund you incremental time. and even if they did, it would be $0.50 per day. If you want to keep trying, you're going to have to suck it up. Either deal with queues or move to another server.
---
Spider Belt... Once every 30 m
---
Broke kids cant pay for subscriptions
---
I rushed home from work and was queueing by 3:10 pst... loggedin after 4.5 hours.  Now whether to stay on Bigglesworth or not
---
Called my son, who is still on summer break, an hour before I left work to log in for me, he said the queue was 75 minutes which ended up working out perfectly.
---
People can be mad. I'm mad about many changes. But the hate circlejerk in this subreddit is just pathetic.
---
And for your pizza analogy, once they removed to much for me to enjoy it I'll stop paying and leave. Does that mean I have to tell everyone that this place is shit and everyone going there is less than me? Because that's what's happening here.

---
And people complain it was laggy ... I cant imagine what could you possibly do for it not to be laggy
---
lol yea i did this i was able to play with out dcing till like 11 at night, made it to level 10 and killed hundreds of boars to do it
---
😂
---
Here's to hoping Blizzard allows for free character transfers after the hype dies down. Hell, I hope they permanently shutter realms and force migrations after a certain point. If last night proved anything to me it's that the game is categorically better when the servers are populated.
---
My queue placd was steadily getting whittled down, but the time was all over the place.  I'd see 1200 queue with 45 min wait, then 850 queue with 190 min wait, then 700 queue with 20 min wait.  Just all over the place time wise, but I finally got in after ~2.5 hours.
---
Honestly i don't know between retail and private servers it was hard to have macros that worked on each version consistently
---
it really wasn't that bad after the initial wave. i just grinded mobs near the starting area and waited for it to clear. i totally wouldn't wait a week if your trying to play. by the time i got off the starting zone was a normal level of people (1 or 2 groups tryna tag sarkoth instead of 45).
---
It might take some adjusting, but try out one of the mice that have a number pad on the left side.  I use this kind of mouse for my caster classes.  Its quite nice for quickly aquiring new targets with spells.  I use the logitech g600
---
I wouldn't worry about it. All you're missing is the extreme poverty of a fresh server lol. The cost of bags is painful, and when your entire main backpack is full of quests and essential items.... It's no bueno.
---
Most people are out Questing and leveling not sitting in cities. Yet.
---
Eh, I use to look up to Conor until he punched an old man in the face.
---
Right... but the first four months of a game are pretty important. Again, I get why we have layering. It just seems like a vestigial organ in cities, where it servers little purpose.
---
Sounds like you’re describing the sham life #shamwow
---
It's almost as if you are rewarded for your knowledge of the world and exploring, and you're not spoon fed a list of activities to do.
---
Funnily enough another poster quoted a 2017 article that states about 27% of wow players as women so now I'm no smarter than before.
---
Yea I played for like 4 hours with no technical problems at all.
---
I wouldn't count on it, like I said im in a que right now lol
---
Sure. I'm eu mate. I played it last night and woke up to a 5 hour queue
---
Go do professions while she levels
---
WoD launch was unmeasurably horrible
---
lvl 12 on migraine, my name is fliptus on there
---
Estimated time: 550min
---
Bullshit to only release 2 german pvp servers. Of which only 1 was available when you could first reserve names.
---
Played 45 mins this morning, 5:30 PDT. Saw Herod and Stallag high.
---
You can get that back with queues tonight lol
---
Galaxy brain
---
I switched. My server, which opened yesterday, has 13000 in line currently.  
---
Come again?
---
This, I usually go buy a wand if playing a caster and not for a while
---
Stalagg queue is bigger than Herod. It's the server they asked Herod players to switch to. Blizz dropped the ball.
---
The more days go by the more people will spread out.  I'd be surprised if any day in WoW Classic will be as crazy as yesterday.  Maybe this weekend will be close but I'd still be surprised if it's *as* bad.
---
Level an alt.
---
Old Blanchy isn't populated to the max at all. Haven't had a server que yet.
---
I think shaman healing is really fun because it dovetails well with being a support class in general. You're helping the party, not just by healing them, but also through buffing up their damage or armor or mana regeneration with your totems. The feeling of helping other people not only stay alive but also kick ass is satisfying to me. With druids you have mark of the wild, but as a shaman you have more versatility in how you choose to help out your teammates.
---
He was encouraging all his other guildies to be toxic. He even said they would tell guild members to ninja everything in any pugs they were in to share with the guild. 
---
Sounds like the type of person who regularly gets beaten up if he goes into public
---
Even if its a tiny amount of health right now. Its nice to have.
---
Is there actually a metric for how many people were logged in/ in queue compiled that provided 2 million? I would love to see that as it was a curiosity me and my entire guild had last night.
---
I'm cool with it
---
Almost like automating warcraftvwas a BAD idea...
---
With the sheer amount of players on all at once would make the game unplayable unfortunately. Did you see how many servers popped up after release last night? I wanna say the list doubled at least. If we would have had that amount of servers at first we probably wouldn't need the layering we have now.
---
The way I see it happening is that the hype is going to die down though and people are going to start going back to the original higher populated servers that we wanted to play on, and all these new servers that popped up are going to go dead. But yeah, layers are pretty much needed right now. I think the way blizzard is looking at it is damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
Take off the layering in phase 2 and probably merge them in the future. I wouldn't think they would announce any merging until phase 6 comes out though. But they said in the beginning that the layering will be out when phase 2 is released, so obviously they know a lot of hype will have died down by then.
---
It's not a race we will all get to 60 I'm sure your friends will help you out.
---
Blizzard is just a bunch of assholes. They always have been. 4 years ago when the community demanded vanilla wow they were assholes.
---
When we created private servers they were assholes.
---
When we told them exactly what we wanted they were assholes.
---
When they finally gave in, they were assholes about it.
---
When we told them there weren’t enough servers and that the launch would be a disaster for queue times, they were assholes. 
---
This response? They’re being assholes.
---
Just fucking apologize blizzard. Like holy shit your customers were right every step of the way. You fought us every step of the way. You’re a bunch of assholes. Just admit it.
---
Except even on low some still has a queue.
---
Holy shit this is why we have layering.
---
I'd say druid. It's just so versatile, you can heal yourself and stealth to get past mobs.
---
This worked for me on Fairbanks... got to level 14 and had a group ready for RFC with all the quests and I got kicked right in front of the instance.... it was a true sign that I needed to sleep, but also incredibly frustrating.
---
I logged in 90 minutes before release time and still didn't get into the game for another ~40 minutes after release time
---

---
Yeah, there really hasn't been a "new" mmo launch on this scale in quite a while that has had a lot of non-mmo player interest. The closest analogue I can think of is SWTOR, which had a huge amount of initial interest forcing Bioware to create a bunch of servers to avoid queues, but then as the interest died off in the next two months lots of servers died, and Bioware didn't respond quick enough which probably led to more players quitting.
---
But a vast majority of the people I was trading with *were* in the city. I just couldn’t see them! So the city really is populated, but it just looks like there’s 10 people to everyone. Sure, even without layering, it might not be a metropolis still, but it would resemble a city more than a ghost town.
---
Wasn’t my experience. We had queues just like this in the gnome/dewar was starting area on Rattlegore.
---
That your "problem" means nothing. more then half the playerbase can't play.
---
Please enjoy, as we wait for our 20k queues
---
not to be confused with the south american game, World of HueHue
---
the pic to post process is faster on a phone imo. vs print screen, going to folder, finding, going to website, uploading etc. just faster on a phone to do all those actions imo. 
---
not talking like breaking records with speed its just more convenient to the point where I could see doing it in a pinch
---
First time In years I saw people say "gratz" when I liveled......"t-thank you"
---
I seem to remember someone saying they try to limit the amount of servers as to keep population high when the hype inevetably dies down. 
---
Yes, we have to wait in long queues now, but as a bonus, our server probably won't be dead in 2-3 months
---
Legion hype was huge and had a huge bump in subscribers for launch, not sure what you're talking about
---
No I can confirm this. Had net issues and dced 10 times. Nvr got signed out of bnet and instaqueued everytime. Meanwhile a friend of mine dced once completely through bnet and got stuck in line
---
I felt the same way. I waited for roughly 6.5 hours to get on Skeram - got up out of bed after a bad work day, and found that I could really enjoy myself. Any laid-back players out there hit me up here and I'll add you to friends.
---
I logged right on. Maybe I’m overestimating my luck, but for me this has been the smoothest launch I’ve experienced from Blizz
---
Ya that makes sense, I just really suck at pvp but it would be worth it to be somewhere other people are also invested
---
I think you somehow took my post the wrong way?  Do you understand what condescending means?  Now that was condescending, sorry. ;)  
---
Listen dude, I get it.  I'm just disappointed in this whole thing.  I  scheduled 8 hours to play, and 6 were spent waiting. This isn't an easy task for someone with a family.  I don't think this what most people meant when they wanted the classic experience.  
---
It's great that they added more servers, it's great you guys got to play on them. It just couldn't work out for me.  I was already in queue when they released those new server at 520pm, I had no way to check queue length and my friends were already playing on this server.  Like I said, there wasn't a good path for us.
---
Hi guys this is blizz, I mean if you want you can get 2 servers more now that all the chaos began.
---
Sure we understand you wanna play a fantasy game with your friends but right now we just have to poop out a couple of server here and there and wait for the best. 
---
Thanks for your money, have a fun day in Q.
---
Point is, if I wasn't stuck in queue I'd be out leveling, not sitting afk in org?
---
Why don’t you take a seat righ- oh, never mind carry on.
---
hahahaha i love it. This is classic.
---
Awesome. Thank you! I really just needed clarification that it’s okay to do for performance and it’s not unusual to do. One other question: Is there lag when you go to right click on a merchant or to sell something and it takes like a second or so for the action to take place? Or is that normal classic wow speed when you have no lag? Lol I don’t even know what lag is suppose to look like on this game I’m so new to it.
---
Westfall. People in general chat kept saying if you log out, you can’t get back in but I logged out multiple times to play with addons and never hit a queue. Other people said the same so I dunno how it works lol.
---
15 min early was a 30 sec queue for me
---
Underrated thread. Blizz deserves a lot of appreciation for being on top of this, monitoring and adding new servers if needed.
---
Welcome to a WoW release. You should of expected this.
---
Any queues on the PvE realms?
---
Course they did, all companies have this technique of having low capacity at launch then extending, its all a money saver, think of most AAA games at launch too, servers are always fucked. Its their turn around in rectifying the issue thats important.
---
yeah unless you wanna quest somewhere else youre going to be under leveled. I remember grinding out a few levels in westfall, doing some quests then heading over to redridge to do some of the lower level quests there then heading back to westfall to finish up the quests there. This running back and forth between zones is going to happen a lot while leveling in classic.
---
No they don't.
---
No dude. Just no.
---
Not sure why they just don't put more server and merge them later. It looks like an obvious solution and they are able to do it but for some reason they prefer to frustrate people in huge queues.
---
Last night, I picked the Old Blanchy realm because it was one of only 2 medium population servers at the time.  It still had a 45 minute queue to login.
---
Lmao nice
---
I have friends on a high pop server :(
---
Were you playing on eastern kingdoms? People told me grobb crashed but I don't know if it was just ek because I'm playing a night elf
---
How about setting render scale higher, with no AA?
---
My Intel is from 2010-2011, runs at 4ghz overclock. Yours should outperform mine by a mile due to higher IPC
---
great job, keep it up
---
&gt;Thirty-six percent of fantasy MMORPG players are women, but only 26% of World of Warcraft players are women. On the other hand, Star Wars: The Old Republic has two times the average ratio of female gamers.
---
Wouldn't that mean even more than 50%? 50% would be twice the WoW female player count, be he names "two times the AVERAGE" which I would assume to mean the average over all RPGs, 36%. So actually 72%?
---
Did you not understand what I’m saying? I understand that most people are leveling... what I’m saying is that the cities would actually be decently busy without layering. It would be a pretty populated hub as opposed to 15 people.
---
Well ya gotta understand, blizzard gave an estimate of 130 minutes /s
---
I got in Whitemane this morning before and after maintenance took about 45 seconds (ish).
---
Its not like the login servers are full, its the servers themselves that are full.
---
Every time that position goes down, thats a player logging off.
---
So yes, servers are as full as they can be and everything is running smooth.
---
You're right, the journey is what I look forward to the most as well. Rushing to 60 would ruin WoW for me. But in the end of the day, everybody has to decide for themselves what they enjoy :)
---
really 9 hours? is this lucifron?
---
Azzip sounds like a warlock imp name.
---
Well here's the problem with the ignorant "no changes" people.  They don't have a clue about what it was.  It's clear that bugs and issues are to be fixed.  No one is demanding warlock pets randomly disappear on them.  No one is begging for warrior charge to make you fall through the terrain.  There's no petition for wall climbing.  
---
The debuff limitation was, is, and will forever be a fix to a BUG in the system, already confirmed by MULTIPLE wow devs, including the main raid developer.  It has been confirmed that:  
---
The debuff limit was NOT a feature.  
---
The debuff limit was never intended to last.  
---
Removing the debuff limit would not impact raiding as NO raid mechanics were designed around certain debuffs.  
---
These have all been officially confirmed by the devs both on twitter and in AMA.  You are just wrong, and your wrong ignorance is going to negatively impact the game many people are chomping at the bit to play again.
---
Glory to the Line!
---
It is amazing to see the difference depending on when you started last night and which race you picked.  I've seen a line for humans, dwarves and orcs.
---
I started 4 hours after launch, and I never once saw any line.  I played on Buc, too, the only RP server.  Never saw a line like this form.  Played a dwarf, went right into the starter cave, took less than 2 minutes to get in and out.
---
Good ole Intel Celeron processor with an integrated graphics system and 2 gigs of RAM. Fuck yeah
---
Is that currently what it is?

I mained a human mage on private servers for awhile. You don't really miss escape artist that much - it effects less abilities then you think it does, and most of your kiting arsenal comes from blink and root anyway, so you won't be outpacing anyone at your normal run speed. I found a lot of the abilities it does work against end up being situationally useless, as is the case of EA'ing away from a Warrior who just charges you and gets a stun (that you can't EA out of).
---
Biggest Brain would be quit my job and go full neet.
---
same
---
Where did all the confidence in this game go? Like I thought I was a pessimist but fucking hell. 
---
I had to sift through 10 posts a day about the game toppling retail and now that it's out people won't leave their 7 hour queue because it's gonna be dead in a week? The game isn't gonna be shit if everyone only wants to play on 3 servers. 
---
If you don't have stubborn friends and you care about the health of the game, you should be rerolling. And your friends should stop being asshats and reroll with you.
---
lights hope with 3k people on was actually dead. Finding a raid took several hours. When there were 6k+ on it was poppin. gotta consider the long run for this game. End game is where a lot of the game exists, and a lot of end game is massive groups.
---
I’m gay
---
Knee jerk reaction
---
Wow.  I just skipped that quest.  (It didn't have a reward for me, so no big loss.)
---
If you're the one in queue, and everyone in game uses AFK prevention methods to stay logged in forever, you will never get out of queue to play the game you're paying for.
---
They are extremely good to the point of necessity for a group later on in the game, but they have one of the hardest times levelling up (as a tank, at least) due to lower damage output, which may or may not be because they are perpetually under-geared. As a result, the more experienced you are at the game, the more you tend to feel guilty about not giving stuff to Warriors due to how important and gear-dependent they are.
---
I just realized classic is as much retail wow now as bfa is.
---
It would be easy if nerds weren't so attached to their damn names.
---
More like reserve your seats now. A server named ashbringer will deffo have at least 5k queue
---
Hahahaha, me walking up at 4:47am: "Alarm goes off in 43 minutes. Little more sleep to go... ... ... ... or I could go push that last little bit to get to 10 before work..."
---
I'm now at work, and my character logged off at level 10.
---
Subscribers yes, but daily log in at a specific time always drops as people return to their regular schedule. 
---
Queue times will drop significantly, probably only happening at all at 6-10pm and not 4 am like right now.
---
When is that?
---
The grind is good, convenience killed the community. And that's bad whenever the game is an MMO.
---
It's Always Sunny in Azeroth
---
They weren't ready...if they had these servers listed weeks ago then they would have been ready.
---
Rushing to open new servers after the game launches is the opposite of being "ready"

Very true! I think it's up to a 20% discount at that point.
---
I just got an estimated wait time of 730 minutes for an EU pvp realm.
---
I logged in from work 2 hours before I got home.
---
anyone want to join a raid group to get the medallion?
---
Hi, /u/send-me-kind-words

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw6ayv/looking_for_guild_faelina_na/). 
---
Yeah it seems to have no consistency. People in gen chat were saying they waited an hour+ and even if they got dc’d, the had to wait again. 
---
Like I said, maybe I just got lucky. Never hit a queue and even this morning right after maintenance, I got right in. But other people in my guild even said they had issues so I really have no idea how it works.
---
For what it's worth Blizzard has posted transfers will be available for low pop realms if it becomes an issue. Personally I see nothing appealing about the high pop realms with congo lines to collect a quest item.
---
I have one. Even on retail wow i had to rebind the buttons do keyboard ones using the corsair scimitar. It worked after
---
I've been thinking this!! Why not add more layers?? There was a blue post that said they could do it if they wanted to.
---
My guess is they think are making a guess about how many players will stop by phase 2 and think it will encourage over population down the line
---
Higher reputation levels make affiliated vendors slightly cheaper.
---
Has anyone hit 60 yet?
---
but people were discussion for months that layering is necessary to avoiud queues. Now we have both....
---
Wondering this as well
---
The solution is one they already had in place - more layering on servers until populations stabilize.
---
Probably the REASON they didn't want to do that is because they'd have to keep layering in place for layer (or potentially over permanently) on realms like faerlina where 50% of the population is trying to play because of streamers.
---
Oh it won't be that much better.
---
But I was hoping by the weekend they'd implement more servers to mitigate the damage.
---
Thanks for those precise infos bud :)
---
My issue was that everyone from Brazil decided to go on a usa east server so mad people were speaking spanish over durotar chat.
---
Yup going to bed!
---
At one time, WoW had over 10 million active users.
---
Two million users for something this hyped is awful.  But then again, there have only been about 1.5-3.0 million active users anyway on WoW retail for quite a long time.  Those numbers are *pitiful* compared to what it once was for years.
---
It boils down to basically the equivalent number of active users already playing WoW just went over to Classic.  There was expected to be a lot more people come back to play Classic that hadn't before.
---
2 million is bad.
---
With the servers as blasted as they are I wouldn’t trust /who lol.
---
I'm not sure. Not at home right now and I forget the one I got
---
same! just grateful for the time i got on launch day!
---
People like cool sounding names, people have pre made plans with large groups that need to be coordinated, people do / don't want to play with streamers... There's a plethora of reasons to want to play on one particular server
---
I dropped Mark of the Wild + Thorns and the occasional heal + HoT on every warrior I saw last night. In return they often grouped with me on big quests to kill lots of mobs quickly. Good blokes
---
Well according to Blizzard they expect a lot of people to stop playing, so while yes, you’re pushing the problem to phase 2. It should be smaller queues due to the people stop playing during phase 1.
---
Troll Tuesday duh.
---
VIP coming through
---
anyone current queue stats for the new Ashbringer or is it open ?
---
Hey! That’s pretty cool!
---
Just chose a low server lol
---
Lets say Korean
---
$15 is quite a lot...?
---
Is it a failure from a business perspective for a restaurant to have a 1 hour wait? Of course not, that means that people want to come to your restaurant to eat.
---
Blizzard have been quick to add new servers to match the demand. It’s incredibly difficult to accurately assess how many players will play a game at launch. At best you can have a general idea, but it’s impossible to know for sure.
---
Yeah it sucks the 2011 doesn't support "metal" which is the bare minimum. I haven't even tried to boot it but it also has the integrated Intel 3000 not the minimum 4000. I mean maybe by the grace of the old gods and the new it could work so maybe I should just try it.
---
*Accidently presses ESC*
---
Orange drink, duh
---
I am
---
Probably a toss up between having the name they wanted reserved, their friends playing on that server, and less chance of the server dying after a few months.
---
1. Teamviewer while at work, login at 10am to 1pm depending region.
---
2. ???
---
3. Profit
---
Well, he's a Big Lad
---
In Spanish they go "beeeeeeehhhh"
---
Probably a streamer.
---
Honestly, whether this is biologically or socially driven, men are just more competitive. So it doesn't surprise me one bit that sports games only sport like 2% women. It's hard to describe the satisfaction it gives me to best someone in Apex Legends or wherever. I love single player games to bits but competitive games can hold my attention for fucking ever.
---
Does Star Wars not have PvP, though? I mean is it missing anything that would attract men, or is it just attracting so many women because it's the one game to really cater to them?
---
You can relog within 5 mins of your quit and you'll skip the queue. This will bump everyone in queue by 1
---
Exactly everyone acts like this game isn’t highly built on large groups of playing and working together. Like if this was how it was going to be they should have just not offered advanced subs and shit. The whole point of that was to avoid this.
---
Smart move!
---
The server I'm on is "medium" and last night when I logged off and tried to log back on there was a 10k queue
---
The subscriber count increased, but the number of players logged in and playing was hugely disproportionate between launch and an average day. They don’t think players are gonna unsubscribe after day 1 but every video game launch in history teaches us that far fewer players will be playing simultaneously as time goes on.
---
Check razer synapse
---
The cynic in me is screaming, "they expect people to burn out after a couple months, so they squeezed a few more weeks of sub time out of people."
---
20 minutes is the timeout i've heard.
---
Expansions and zero day at launch are two **very** different things
---
Yeah, at some point th dynamic and pace of the game will change with a ton of extra players around. The game world, timers an so on we're created to accommodate a specific number of players more or less, not double/triple
---
I figure the queue timer gives an estimate based on the frequency of players logging off to open spaces up.
---
While waiting two hours just to see the wait time go unchanged, it could just mean that the rate of players logging off is far slower than when you started.
---
Let's say you try to get in and it's a 60 minute timer and you're position 6000. This would suggest that it estimates that 100 players are leaving per minute.
---
Let's say 30 minutes pass and you're in position 3000, but the estimate is players are now leaving at about 50 per minute. The wait time will still be about 60 minutes.
---
So the timer is telling you an estimate based on the perceived rate of players logging off/in.
---
On STRESS
---
Cloud based web hosting is not a solution to a problem like WoW.
---
Is a High, Medium, and Low server a hard limit? Can a Low server become a Medium or High server if more people join it?
---
One of the biggest reasons people gave for wanting classic was for cooperation and community and now that people are being nice and not making it more difficult everyone complains lmao. No one likes waiting in lines for a fetch quest but sitting there with this many people just spam clicking and hoping you'll get it is even worse
---
Yeah i mean since we can even combine set effects, it makes the older raids worth while.
---
I did make a character on Noggenfogger when it was low and it just became medium! And now there is a que as well. I think you won't regret rolling there. If Blizz release new realms, I think the same thing will happen, since there are still 132k people in que as of 16.00 (I read in another thread on here).
---
So if you want my 2 cents: Go for it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=193/panther-mastery
---
not sure why everyone is hating on him...for people who have jobs, we all get home at a prime time hour where everyone else with jobs is also trying to log in. so yeah queues may be low NOW, but that's because its freaking 11:40 AM EST. last night, I tried to log on at around 10 pm, and every single pvp server had a queue. for people who want to log in for a couple hours a day or so, it is impossible to play. right now, the game is only playable for people who have excess time to leave a computer open sitting in queue. its laughable that activision had as little servers at launch and claimed they had collected data to justify the amount of servers they had. they didn't even have enough servers for the amount of ppl subbed to this reddit alone. clearly underestimated how many 18 to mid 20 year olds with no real career were going to log in. 
---
anyone whos saying otherwise has either A. took time off from work and is sitting at home at their computer hours before launch to log in. B. has no actual career or full time job and can sit in front of a screen for hours waiting out a queue. or C. got extremely lucky and skipped a queue during dc.
---
it shouldn't take me 3 hours to log into a game. yeah id like to be refunded or credited some of my sub back to apply to the next month because theres no way in hell that ill be able to get any adequate time in game if I have to spend a few hours just waiting to get in. they said they had it under control, and they did not. they were warned of this. 
---
this is just the reality of the situation. the people spewing stupid stuff in response are the same people doing nothing but spending a few hours just to get to that first minute of gameplay.
---
I am on medium pop server. There were more than 13000 people waiting in line just to connect with a 4.5 hour queue last night. There is more than twice the people just waiting in line to connect than the entire server population of a medium population server in vanilla. Considering Blizzard said esch server can hold multiple tes the amount of people from original vanilla servers, 0lus laying that is going away in 2, and the massive lines....no it won't be dead.  
---
Imagine worrying about dead servers when it takes over 4 hours in queue just to connect. You people are rediculous.
---
All this moaning, did you not want the classic experience 😂
---
Luck favors the prepared. I hadn’t decided to give WoW a chance until I saw some friends playing Classic last night so I bought it on an impulse.
---
Tfw you use your character name reservation for the realm Asmon picks
---
I just got the same names on a different realm
---
Skeram? It was like this for me everywhere on Skeram.
---
My god that’s brilliant.
---
Use steam and steamlink, gives you ”proper” controlls for your phone. Manage to kill 1 trogg at work before i got a DC and had to requeue.
---
What new server? Realms released yesterday already have 10k+ queues.
---
Is there a way to change the button to take a screenshot?
---
I see, and would there be any server that is particularly newbie friendly?
---
Im in queue since 1pm. @4000 now. 
---
soon
---
Alkaizer lvl 27 now
---
That's why he/she had such a good time. It was all a dream and he/she is still stuck in the queue
---
There was an interview where Ion stated they could afford to have more than enough servers but chose not to because they want to think down the line when people are not gonna play and don’t wanna deal with losing money in the long run with “abandoned servers”. 
---
What a joke, he makes it seem its not financially and technically possible to combine servers and offer free transfers down the road to low pop servers... like what the hell is the 15 bucks a month for?
---
"Look at me. I'm retail now." - Classic WoW
---
Do you play on a Taiwan server?
---
We have a hulk.
---
Every server on EU has these kind of queue times. We also have less international servers to choose, thus exacerbating queue issues. There simply isn't "Go to another server," they're all stacked right now.
---
When the blood flows back to the brain, he'll realise that its literally impossible for Blizzard to know, much less care enough to track, when his bathroom breaks occur. Its simply bad timing and coincidence.
---
No queue mate
---
Because I want to play with my friends/family/guildmates.
---
His Unstoppable Force broke her immovable object
---
THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Move servers noob
---
Yeah except "certain" people don't get them.
---
Exactly!!! 2 weeks of planning from name reservations and switching from Herod &gt; Stallag &gt; Skeram.  Then launch happens and everyone ended up scattered anyways.  I so hope they allow free server transfers eventually.
---
I mean bigger pservers had way higher numbers than that. Nost was averaging like 12k
---
Don’t know how you got that. I socialized with WoW strangers more just last night than I have in the past 7 years of retail.
---
We didn't choose Kromcrush, the server chose us.
---
Yeah I totally understand I was just curious I mean honestly if I hadn’t got to almost 20 yesterday I totally would’ve rerolled
---
Why dont you set up google remote desktop, go to work, and mid day get in queue, youll be near the bottom of the queue by the time you get back.
---
8k Ragegore EU been waiting for about 1.2 hour now now position in q 1.7k
---
wut u did ther..
---
i c it
---
I joined mine at low pop. I played a few hours. It was a medium within that time.
---
&gt; but how can i be sure that the server is not dead in a couple of months     
---
       
---
You can't.    
---
    
---
&gt; Is there going to be server transfer      
---
      
---
It has been hinted at, and business wise, it wouldn't make sense for them not to offer it. It's another revenue stream that they have no reason blocking.    
---
   
---
The other thing you need to keep in mind is that all the current server size designations are relative to the most full realm. Blizzard said prior to launch day, "medium is higher pop than the fullest servers during vanilla". And that was before they had to double the servers available on the spot. I would imagine current "Low" is greater than actual vanilla "Full".
---
Real eyes recognize real lies
---
Same. seems like anyone who was logged got kicked out and a whole new wave of queuers got in instantly...
---
Basically that reaction, yes. "Don't you just love it? Don't you?!"
---
Logging out to character select and being disconnected from the server aren't the same
---
Nah, Sulfuras was created after
---
I’m relaxed... and bummed about cities... that’s about the gist of the post?
---
I give it a couple weeks for hype to die off and people slowly stop playing as much, then queues will be better
---
Maybe go talk to a doctor.
---
Been in queue for 5h on shazzrah (:) still 2.5k away from getting in. If i leave autorun on will i not get dced if i want to to get some dinner?
---
6K Razorgore
---
Yup. I got downvoted for it but even multiple teachers have said that the so called "diginatives" can barely use PC. They do almost everything on phones with handy apps. This is of course perfect for millennials working in IT/tech field since it means the zoomers will be mostly pc illiterate and won't be a threat to your job position.
---
That was an order
---
Who gets fucked on their names when this happens?
---
Oh, you mean the new server that launched yesterday? The one with huge queues? We already server hopped several times pre-launch, now we are expected to do it again after people made their characters?
---
It's weird, i disconnected myself on purpose like 20 times when i was installing addons and then my spot was reserved.
---
I’m not butt hurt at all friend. But elitist douchey attitudes will ruin this game. Let’s create a good community not a shitty one.
---
I'm near the Chicago land area. So another poster mentioned microcenter and I can get to one of those. So probably anything available there. I checked their website and the westmont location is the closest.
---
herod will be worth waiting to get into imo. If its just an hour to play for 5 or so then it's totally worth it. Herod will more than likely never die.
---
I camped one spawn point for like 40 minutes and got all 6
---
thats some bullshit, Tauren advantage shouldnt be a thing.
---
Acting like you're morally superior when you're the one on classic wow subreddit saying BfA is better 😂
---
Happy you’re feeling better man :)
---
Wow haha I’ve only spent enough time to wait in que for my current realm so I was unaware of this. I would’ve rerolled I just got to almost 20 last night so that’s a bit far back
---
This is really nice to see without people just hopping on the spawn. But I have to ask, what quest are these? if respawn timer is 5 mins then the guy in back has at least 2 hours of just sitting there waiting. It would be so much faster to just skip quests like this and move on.
---
Wtf
---
just enjoy the 15k queue
---
You will not play a single second, sorry to ruin it for you.
---
Well fucking done.
---
What’s the problem in using quest Addons? You can still read. It just helps. It’s the same as going into thotbot back in the day.

Now imagine the queue pops and at the very moment your wife goes in labour. What do you do?
---
Several thousand people moved from high population servers to low population servers which were then full the next day and now have queueing issues.

I didn have any problems buying mount at level 40 15 years ago and I had no clue what I was doing back then. Just don't spend gold on dumb shit and youll be fine

Is that what the Q timer is right now?

I started off on Thalnos last night, was waiting on the character screen 20 minutes before launch and got in immediately. Chat was nothing but Portuguese and Spanish so I logged out and switched to Incendius. 6 hours later I finally got in and the chat was all English.
---
You had a 6hr queue? Jesus...
---
To add to that, general chat in Durator last night was full of people complaining and saying they were going back to BFA,  
---
So keep in mind that a good chunk of players from BFA that came to check out classic last night are already back in BFA.

hey dude thanks for this
---
https://youtu.be/M2CFFULmONk
---
If they can move and adjust things way quicker nowadays I don’t get why they wouldn’t just let the realms be a little less large with layering and have more realms. It would be way easier to do free server transfers if and when that happens than this potentially lasting the whole first week or longer and lose players.
---
I feel like there should at least be one server with less than 20min cues up per type and region.
---
Shouldn't matter but I always launch from battlenet launcher just so I don't have to type login info
---
Not sure about an add on that does it; however, this wasn’t a feature that was around in Classic. On a side note, for those with gathering professions like Herbalism and mining you can still track items (only one at a time though not both) by going into the General tab of your spell book and clicking the Track Herbs or Tarck Mining “spell”. Please keep in mind I do believe this tracking “spell” goes away each time you die and therefore must be refreshed from time to time.
---
no but I keep reading on the blizz forums that people really want a dedicated Spanish server
---
relax
---
I met a lot of people during launch night. We decided the South Park boar killing strat was the way to go at the start. Grinded to level 5. RIP Grope you were the best level 2 tank. He died like 15 times.
---
Please click the tutorial popups 😬
---
That's a bit much for 2004. If you were still sharing the line you probably weren't playing WoW. Before cable we had a dsl line in my house around 2001.
---
*scatman intensifies*
---
Which is also the sound you made when you realized you logged right in and started playing?
---
You are correct.
---
So in vanilla i rolled holy. Played a shockadin style with a 2h. Literally unkillable and can do pretty good damage still. Roll holy dps. You wont kill as fast as ret but uou will have an easier leveling experience. And you can always save a 1h and shield to heal in dungeons
---
Serenity... **NOW!!!**
---
I usually don't care about things like this... but it is quite entertaining how mad people get about it and how so many cannot resist the compulsion to say something about it as if it has any effect on their life in any way.
---
I moved to Bigglesworth and it was great. Instant logins. Logged out after an hour and logged back in 30 minutes later with no queue.
---
Because there are still hardware capabilities. The more layers you add and characters you put on a server, the more processing power it takes to keep them there.
---
Do you distribute nation wide?
---
Rip Cowabunga the Tauren Shaman. You have the best name but I will not sit in a 30k player que for anything.
---
&gt;I logged out for a bit and managed to get back in.
---
Logging out in my hears sounds like going offline, not just in character select, but you are probably right.
---
Yes that's just uhh... a coincidence!
---
It disconnected all my friends that were playing for over 5 hours, while those that were just playing for 1-2 hours did not experience a disconnect. The conspiracy is real!
---
Logged in at 7:31 no queue
---
This is fantastic! Thank you!!
---
Then what good would transfers do now?
---
Yes... yes it is.. :)
---
The wall runners will get kicked eventually. Their afk system counts the same action repetitively as still being afk iirc.
---
Godspeed, friend.
---
Goto the gym.
---
jesus christ, already?
---
They had backup servers in the event the hype wasn't as big as expected. They released servers at a pace where there was always an open server. This way they don't run into the issue of having multiple dead servers after the hype dies down.
---
They know what they're doing.
---
Aaaand noggenfogger is now experiencing queues, well. At least it'll thrive.
---
Every time blizzard launches a new Xpac launch days never go to plan, never!
---
What is the problem here
---
It seems like that is already happening, people are getting disconnected mid game left and right, and at the same time queue drops by ~2k for those waiting in it.
---
Bunch of guildies had that happen already, same happened for me after 3 hours of playing with 4 hours in queue before, I got dc and was put back to the end of the queue.
---
Spassvogel lmao. Fun bird
---
Can understand if you’re rolling a warrior but as a mage you can blink out of roots. You probably would want to consider the intellect racial benefit as a mage but I’d personally go for aesthetic preference over a stat bump.
---
These reasons are all exactly why Aff Warlock became my main first time around in Vanilla.  I was the only reliable warlock in my guild, people loved the candy and the summons.
---
It’s also helpful to use lower ranked buffs. You save mana and I get a little boost!
---
6+ For Shazz.
---
Then you get in and a server restart or a layer disconnect and boom, you're back at minimum 9k. it is what it is, we were all warned about it tbh.
---
Dang man you got lucky. I logged on Fairbanks at 6 and didn’t get in until midnight. 16k queue at 6pm. Got lvl 8 before I went to bed tho!
---
Wholesome
---
Starting now isnt bad, at least on Atiesh. Much less packed starting zones, no login queue. I say go for it!
---
Out of those 4?  The third one assuming you don't mind that it seems to be used.
---
Ur low effort
---
Same, but I randomly dced half an hour ago while I was in the bathroom and now i'm stuck in a 4h+ queue .-.
---
They don't want to risk dead servers.  Some unknown percentage of the swarm frothing at the bit to get in are tourists at best.  They'll be gone in a week, some other percentage will burn out later than that.  Attrition will eventually fix the queues, but it will take time, or people spreading out to new servers.
---
Unfortunately, most people believe (and I do too), that the population going to the newest servers are the most likely to attrition out, and by extension, those servers are most likely to die.  Investing months in a character, only to find out your server is dead is not a good vanilla feel.
---
tbf, i still really think blizzard made the right move. It really is hard (impossible) to accurately estimate the number of people who would play, and too many servers on launch is much much worse than too few.
---
fuck man, I wish my friends would not be so stubborn. They got into Stalagg while a few of us got stuck in a 18k+ que. They wouldn't switch and played all night. There's no way they're switch servers now...
---
Alright, thanks a lot for the detailed answer! I really appreciate it! :)
---
No, you can’t.
---
Have fun in that queue while I'm 4 levels ahead
---
It's way faster actually
---
Good thing Blizzard started off with 2 pvp realms, amazing idea that totally didn't contribute 100% towards this shitshow.
---
Wholesome. This will be worth millions in a couple tens of years.
---
You've been a great help. Guess I'll be making a decision tomorrow when I go there
---
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? Have you not been reading the blue posts about the demand and how they're trying to balance server deployments with queues as to not create underpopulated realms? This launch has been 10x smoother than almost any expansion launch or Vanilla WoW itself. The fact that people could even play is huge.
---
That may be due to people switching realms when they were suggested to
---
Why did you even try to get on a high pop realm?
---
***PATCHWERK MÖCHTE SPIELENNNNNNNNN!***
---
Hmm not sure. Wowheads queue tracker says biggles had a 5k queue at 10pm pst which is 12am cst
---
Tempted to leave now as I just got kicked from the queue that I was in for 4 hours.
---
Back to 20k now.
---
Thing is my whole guild and RL mates are all on Firemaw
---
Im running teamviewer on my phone. Going to log int when I go to lunch to try to time the que for when I get home.
---
You're joking right? They said waits on herod will easily be 6+ hours. I don't know where you got that info from.
---
0/10 Troll
---
Started at 15s, but sales were slow. Picked up really fast when dropped to 10s.
---
Oh, i read that they abandon you. I didn't imagine it would happen very fast, but i'm half the world away from getting the feed ability. I figured it would probably happen before i got back to org.
---
Also in the DC area, also interested
---
I get what he’s saying though if you made it through the queue and get disconnected you shouldn’t be placed at the end of the queue again. Your place should be held. Really negatively impacts players affected in this way. 
---
I got disconnected after hitting level 2 and took about 3 hours to get back in.
---
Alright thanks. I just want to know what’s good performance and what is lag.
---
now 2 more

Uhm dany is her nick name from the books. Which are still pretty fucking awesome.
---
Nah just get in now. If you catch a queue, play another game or wait it out some other way. The starting areas aren't terribly crowded due to sharding and faster respawn rates (except for "boss" quests you may wait a bit).
---
Yikes , this happens to every mmo every launch like I under stand launch hype but people should know by now in 2019 launch weeks blow 
---
-get your LAN party 2 weeks after launch you guys will have 100x more fun and be wayyyyyyyy more productive
---
Because you might get some solace knowing that the face of WoW on twitch isn't an actual jerk. My response was directed more at the entitled aspect and less at whiny, since that is annoying regardless of irony
---
If you will stay on character screen, you will be dced in around 15 minutes for afk
---
Its not a game for everyone. Its more like a slow D&amp;D style RPG. Its about the journey and not the end game. The end game for Vanilla is a few raids where you probably won't get many upgrade if any unless you raid consistently and PvP where it's a rock paper scissors or RNG burst. I personally love it because I enjoy the slow progression where every upgrade or boss kill feels meaningful.
---
I turned 16 in '04 so I remember it pretty well. I definitely knew people that still shared the phone line but my family had converted entirely to cell phones by then. That was unusual then, but would become standard in just a few more years.
---
We acutally waited over 10 years in queue if you think about it.
---
Naw guys, c'mon, remember that one thread: "Blizzard knows more than you"
---
Fuckin' lol.
---
Grace period won't hit for a server side DC as the server crashed and didn't store your "i'm logged in" information.
---
If your client crashes or you log out, you'll get the grace period
---
just play on another realm dumbass, its not like blizzard is restricting you from playing.
---
I'm no IT person so I don't know how feasible this is, or even if it would be economically viable to them, but I kind of wish they had a bunch more servers and had just announced that servers A and B would merge in phase 2 (or earlier of pops drop precipitously), servers C and D, servers E and F, and sho on and sho on.
---
Who knows, it very well may stop being an issue pretty quick. I imagine tourists will fall off after a few days, maybe a few weeks, and things will settle in.
---
From WoWhead: Avg queue for EU: 9000+ players
---
Avg queue for NA: 800 players.
---
Yet NA has 3 times as many servers as EU.
---
DoA. Just kidding.
---
I literally logged on 2 minutes before it popped on Old Blanchy and got right in. Played for 5 hours, no lag, no DC.  
---
Old Blanchy... more like Old Faithful.
---
*people using PrintScreen instead of snipping tool*
---
I think it's mostly nostalgia, and people wanting to play in one big and alive world, which classic offer.   
---
Tbh if I were a newcomer to WoW I don't think I would want to play classic over newest expansion.
---
Horde on rattlegore assemble!!
---
I spent like 3 years playing wow on various characters before i made it to level cap. This shit isnt diablo. The world is the game as much as raiding/arenas is the end of the game. Thats why it takes so long to level up compared to other games.
---
Hahahaha, now this shit takes me back to vanilla. Gamers are such a joke.
---
Get better friends. Mine all rerolled so we could stick together.
---
I mean.. Even the Medium realms have like 5k queue
---
is that really a hard decision to make? it's just a name... you guys take this shit way too seriouslh
---
its not that complex, they should've had plenty of servers ready to fire up if they got as overloaded as they did on launch day. realm firsts/server firsts are irrelevant, why does that even matter? economic implications? yeah maybe a few more herbs here and there or some devilsaur, but nothing game changing if you take action soon. actively monitor the populations, see how each server trends in terms of population, merge them when two start becoming at half capacity. theres no reason for 20k queues right now whatsoever. duplicate names/guild names? get real, were adults we can get over trivial shit like having a certain name or guild name, that has no real impact on gameplay. they can easily get an idea of what server populations will be like before phase 2 is out. right now is the time to have many servers so the queue is not in excess of 5k. when you have queues that are as large as almost double the capacity, something is extremely wrong.
---
I started on Thalnos yesterday since that's where I had my name reservations. Got in immediately and found the chat filled with Portuguese and Spanish. I switched to Incendius, which just opened up yesterday, and had a 6 hour queue before I got in. It's not as simple as "just go to a server without a queue".
---
Yea, I see all that 50k ppl that don't play, how much fucks they give about some shitty name. 
---
Anyway made a ticket to refund my game time. I wanted classic to be my last MMO, but Blizzard can't manage a single launch after 15y of expansions, at least it is still better launch than WoD.
---
It's called Guidelime, it allows you to load a specific leveling guide and it gives detailed steps. It also marks the steps as completed automatically, so that's nice.
---
Already adressed your potential comment dumbass :)
---
Should have mentioned I'm EU. Is Atiesh an EU realm? I've heard (From friends and Forums) that EU realms are really bad for ques.
---
Sitting on 14 hours /played, this game is going to be the end of me.

---
100% sure they take turns rotating people out, we've noticed it happens after u've played 7-8hours
---
didnt try it yet but i forgot about the music affecting fps
---
You don't have to wait. You choose to wait. I'm Playing on medium pop and I haven't had to wait longer than 15mins
---
The best part about WoW vanilla is that the world was so immense that you could literally get lost in a zone for hours, finding things some people may never see. Explore. Enjoy the rich lore and the feeling that this place is alive; or at the very least as alive as you want it to be. There’s a lot out there that only gets enhanced by the sheer volume of people playing with and around you.
---
I was thinking that might be the case.
---
This is still the smoothest MMO launch probably ever.
---
Dude. We had 1 PvP and 1 PvE Server until short before release.
---
How important are professions? Which ones are higher or lower value and are you legitimately rewarded for putting effort into them?
---
Thats what Brexit is for.
---
I think you have every right to a refund on those 2 weeks, you were promised a name reservation and then told to roll on another server, negating any value whatsoever you got out of the 2 weeks' subscription fee. It was false advertising.
---
Who spreads these lies...
---
Got my names there. Hope to avoid 20k queues.
---
I just picked up a razer orbweaver, and it’s pretty awesome
---
Didn't Blizzard say if the realm dies they would consolidate with transfers?
---
Can't tell if bad shitpost or not
---
&gt; farce of a company
---
Yeah god forbid the company that finally gave us what we wanted is trying their fucking hardest to prevent server underpopulation and that we have to deal with queues for a few days. Get the fuck over yourself.
---
Yeah we didn’t have much luck in Westfall either.  Had lines for the tools outside, but couldn’t get it to work in the cave
---
Where. Are. New. EU. Servers?!
---
I'm 100% sure that somewhere in the galaxy length terms of use there is a clause that you agree to that blizzard reserves the right for technical difficulties.
---
Good. I was just worried that sense he is a new pet with shit loyalty, he would abandon me before i could get back to org and finish the quest.
---
I did the same thing, I'm not too worried about finding enough est players to play with, been seeing a lot of people doing the same thing.
---
except that even the server that just opend already has 3k+ que
---
I can't play and there is no real alternative for germany
---
What's logical about locking people that aren't no-lifing it out of the game?
---
Not for classic, bit there is some sort of trial or starter account for retail.
---
Get a left handed mmo mouse
---
Are you really incapable of understanding jokes, bud?
---
I could understand top players having a match that is televised. 
---
Majority of the video game streamers would be the equivalent to my fat ass filming myself throwing a football in my backyard.  Which is much different than watching the nfl
---
/r/woooosh
---
Yeah, because shared tagging was invented. Ain’t nobody got time for that!
---
That's what I am thinking, or they consolidate the servers after the initial rush for the first few weeks.
---
It’s kind of funny thinking back to the times when they didn’t even want language servers because they thought the demand was too low. Now we’ve got multiple of each, and they’re *depserately* needed.
---
It worked for me. People are too busy taking screenshots of their disconnect and miss their opportunity.
---
No trial, $15 a month gets you the game and subscription
---
I don't think it will get any better till the end of the week, considering there are just as much players in a queue right now than which are ingame (according to queue statistics someone posted earlier). Maybe see if they open up more realms. But I expect queue times to be still heavy at the weekend. It's gonna get better in 2-3 weeks though, especially if Blizzard opens up more servers.
---
Is Herod still going to be the main East coast hardcore PvP Server? there are a ton of new ones since we reserved names
---
Yes...
---
But this is awesome!
---
It completely changes the hierarchy of guilds on a server, changes the AH game, the world pvp/duelling scene. There's gonna be overlapping guildnames, character names.
---
Classic players want to recognize who they are with on a server, merging servers achieves the complete opposite. Image your neighborhood being merged with one a town over and you having new neighbors. Ofcourse it changes your community.
---
lol good luck, the server Ashbringer released 3 hours ago already has 5k+ queues
---
WoW, I really am stupid for asking the question.
---
When was the last time you played WoW on dedicated graphics? I'm sat here at a LAN party next to a guy using a HD5500 and getting a locked 60FPS in retail at lower graphics settings.
---
A lot of the old truths just don't apply these days, integrated graphics aren't as bad as they used to be, and the requirements of WoW aren't really all that high.
---
EU truly got fucked the hardest, 5 servers already with 20k queues
---
what are the names of the new servers
---
As if queues weren’t long enough /s
---
For real bro, keep spreading the holiday cheer, the more the merrier in the community.
---
Spoiler alert: his baby died
---
Yeah, this is actually important. We got some lag and all, but I got to lvl 7 in a few hours and it was almost impossible to tag a mob. The first service would not handle 1/5th of this
---
maybe it does maybe not but its strange that people on the same layer got dc while some are staying in game for no reason
---
I just walked up to a mage a few minutes ago and offered to trade outta nowhere and put a mana pot in the box. He stood there a sec then put a health pot in on his end. It's little things like this that make Classic great.
---
Agreed. Pay 15 dollars to go stand in lines on the internet lmao
---
Yes I agree 100%. They should have opened more servers when they saw the demand with the name reservations. OR they could have opened new servers right after launch so people were more inclined to migrate. Opening new servers so far after the launch doesn't help. I moved to a new server and now am worried about it being dead in a few months.
---
Team #nochanges
---
My guild had a backup plan. It was the lowest populated PvP server when blizzard announced that servers were full. 
---
We all had our names reserved on stalagg, which blizzard specifically asked us to move to. 
---
Stalagg was just as packed as Herod. 
---
But some people had gotten in on Herod. 
---
There’s no way that we’re getting everyone to switch to kromcrush last minute, it’s just not going to happen. 
---
I didn’t even get my name on kromcrush lol. 
---
If blizzard had released kromcrush and bigglesworth a week ago, we would have had one of them as a second backup. 
---
But blizzard didn’t, so we didn’t, and our backup didn’t pan out. We had to make a snap decision, no one wants to get left behind, so we hard committed to Herod as all of the queues were long, everyone has their names on Herod, and some people have invested time on Herod. 
---
If blizzard had just released the servers a week earlier, we wouldn’t have had this problem.
---
Yeah I did the same. The morning crew is where it’s at lol
---
/gquit
---
I should've put this in the post. Sorry, I checked this morning before going to work about 8 hours later and it still wasn't gaining any rested xp... I heard that you have to be at least lvl 5 to get rested XP but can't find any information on whether or not that's true.
---
Where would you recommended a new player go to find a group of noon friendly casuals to play with? Do I just run arround asking people if they wanna group up?
---
Westfall is a new EST PVE server they added yesterday.
---
I don't recall them divulging server capacities, I was just curious.  
---
To share my two cents though, I don't think anyone will experience a "dead" server. Think about it. Servers back in vanilla had around ~3k player caps. If servers have caps right now of ~12k, even if we experienced a 75% dropoff in players, we'd still have 3k realm populations - the same as the max that realms could have back then. Even an 85% dropoff would still leave around 2,000 players.  
---
Vanilla was built around having smaller player populations in the 2-3k range, I honestly don't see a problem.
---
&gt;on the same layer got dc while some are staying in g
---
i will follow on this
---
&gt; if we had like 10-15 realms at start people would be spread out a lot more.
---
Generally not really how it works.  A few big influences pick a server and that server spreads.  Everyone wants to be on the same server as another particular person or group who has their own list and it ends up being a chain of people who all want to be on the same server.
---
The concept of having separate servers like it's 2005 is very.... 2005.  I guess it's kind of acceptable since it's "classic", but there's really not many excuses for any other MMO.
---
I’ve been at 2127 in que for about 45 min. Just gonna have to sit it out I guess.
---
&gt; Is it worth to come back to classic.
---
&gt; Did you guys get that enjoyment buzz as you did when 1st played  
---
&gt; Or do you think this is a over hype for Blizzard to rake in a few $$ in subs for a few months then it die off.      
---
         
---
Yes. All of the above.
---
I'm at work right now, but what about the posts that claim that the new servers added earlier also already have +5k queues? Certainly doesn't seem like nobody wants to play there.
---
very true
---
I'm on Patchwerk now.
---
Is there some kind of leveling leaderbord, to see who is ahead? :)
---
Golemag 25k+
---
Dude, I live in Brazil, last night the queue to Stalagg realm it's about 960min, haha. I was go to the bed when I see that!
---
You can try what I wrote on my other comment with the battle net installer too (instead of the wow one).
---
No. Read the EULA and shut up.
---
You paid $15 bucks (assuming you didn't already have an active subscription) and it's a grand opening of a major event in the game. There have always been queue times around this stuff. You're being unreasonable. 
---
the services are still available. I was able to play 4 hours last night. If you were dead set on waiting on a server with massive queues that's on you. the longest wait i had at any point was 14 minutes. I just picked a server with medium pop.
---
And I get my posts kicked for being "low effort"? #specialrulesforspecialpeople
---
Have fun! One small tip when you hit 10... assuming you're going frost, put your first couple points into the '2% less chance for enemies to resist' talent, instead of the Frostbolt cast time talent. Cast time is great, but early on when you're mana starved and have to drink after every other mob, making sure your spells actually hit is more important.
---
 5 hour queue &gt; play for 5 minutes &gt; DC &gt; 5 hour queue 
---
I agree. Fantastic job Blizzard!
---
F. At least he’ll have more time to grind
---
What? Took me 1 hour to queue from 7:30 to get in. When I was back later it's a different story though... 4 hours to get from 14k to 7k, then I had to go out again xD
---
Not expecting much playtime atm.

Ofcourse not brother, just a person that needed to rant. :(

I meant more like are people going to be playing in 6-12 months or is it gonna be dead
---
Originally rolled on Herod, moved to Stalagg, now I’m on Kurrinaxx or Kleenex as it has been so affectionately named
---
Telling someone they "can't" do something isn't giving advice. He's saying it's not possible. If OP doesnt believe him he can go do more research.
---
**"Can I take this?"**
---
"No, that would be stealing."
---
**"You're neither a cop or judge, you shouldn't be trying to enforce laws on me"**
---
until your layer crashes an hour later and you have to wait in queue again.
---
 **/gquit**
---
I signed just to keep you fucks from spamming the general chat in the EU servers.
---
The post updated a long time ago. However I can tell you that EU queues are around 20k now.
---
This just seems like a war that doesn't need to be waged. You could all actively be logged into another server having the same experiences as you would on Herod... rather than sitting in a queue.
---
your doing gods work
---
This is what I am worried about as well. As of now my friends are committed to Sulfuras, I am just worried about it being a dead server.
---
I still can't get into a goddamn server man
---
Source...?
---
I logged out completely, not only to char select. And was still given the grace period.
---
WeakAuras?
---
Same happened to me this morning, just got dc now and have to wait in a 23k queue lol
---
What did you expected? It was possible to predict that no. of servers is to low for demand ;)
---
I prefer to wait a month and then join :)
---
Yeah I just logged in and currently at 7500
---
Yes it did. I played on Daggerspine US for most of classic, and once Naxx released it took a huge hit in population size to the point where I also ended up rerolling because there weren't enough people to form groups with. Daggerspine by WotLK was a "New Players" server it was so lowly populated, and merged with other servers eventually.
---
It's cyclical, and it happens.
---
These are most likely one layer crashing and vomiting everyone out. People have been noticing 2000 player jumps in queues when someone else says they've been disconnected.
---
RIOT è\_é (for real)

TSM is the only addon that comes to my head with AH price in bag, there may be others but that’s the only one I know, and I’m not sure if they have it for classic yet.

On KromKrush people decided to be animals and just huddle around bosses and not firm lines. So I equipped my fastest attacking one handed and started a group. Tagged the boss on the first try.

Moved from Herod, to Stalalgg to Skeram a week out from launch.
---
Que'd up 30 minutes before servers went live, 6 hours queue.

10/10 would do again. (1500 in queue at this moment)

Literally every realm except Thalnos. Thalnos was the designated Central/South American server.

Turn off addons one by one, reloadui UI between turning off.  When the bar disappears, you know what addon is causing it.
---
Yeah need to see what game looks like in 2 weeks/month I wasn’t very hyped until I logged on last night but I am sure once people try it and see how much stuff isn’t in the game will go back to retail. Like it will have a player base but it’s yet to be seen if it will be big yet.
---
Sitting at around 900 players position in queue, estimated wait time 2 minutes... been 1 hour 30 minutes, and it's gone down from 900 to 800 in 20 minutes
---
Wish he could help me (:
---
Hahaha can I trade mine after your trade is complete. Actually just keep mine for free.
---
Quick question: Did you restart the client after DC to avoid typing in email/password like me?
---
I think to get the grace period you need to login manually, i.e. don't restart client but manually type in email/password.
---
Can't confirm but after a second DC while in queue I manually logged in and got my place back.
---
Big if true.
---
I don’t know about now but last night it was. I assume today isn’t as bad
---
Definitely not the case. MacOS wouldn't recognise it as an application if I had.

---

---
lmaoooo rekt
---
If you really did get to play you have a 3 minute grace period from disconnects or closing your game to log in instantly. So stop lying.
---
I actually want them to wait and see how this evening shakes out. The [queue tracker on Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294723/launch-classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc) shows that half the servers have no wait time right now, with the original servers still looking really, really bad. A lot of rebalancing will probably happen in the next few days as people move off overloaded servers. A couple days of patience to get it right is a lot better than spreading the player base too thin and getting dead servers in a couple months.
---
Honestly, the launch was flawless. The people complaining about queues had already been warned and could pick another server. Got into a 26k queue myself, no surprises. I clicked westfall out of curiosity and got in instantly, no queues. Still gonna wait because I want to be part of the "main server" but that's entirely my fault.
---
Ah man, that sucks. I know the PvP servers are ridiculous. This morning it seemed like there was space on every server...except the PvP ones 😂
---
So you want low pop servers, right? You'd rather them just blanket release servers and then fuck up the game after a bunch of people stop playing?
---
And I want you to think about how many people are actually trying to log in. Millions. Do you know anything about server infrastructure and what that kind of demand requires? It's almost impossible to 100% plan for.
---
Nobody said remove them from servers he is suggesting a Spanish realm. Learn to read.

Twitch needs to make just chatting like 50+ only.

The amount of XP earned for lvl 15 equals about 1.5% of the total xp required for lvl 60. Just saying. Classic WoW is about the journey, a lengthy journey.
---
That only happened on super populated realms, I played on Bloodsail and the longest queue I had was like 45 minutes.  I get that’s anecdotal but as someone else said it wasn’t the login servers that were full either it was the server itself.
---
Also I’m comparing this launch to the utter shitshows TBC and WoD were.
---
Yup! I had a 45min queue! But then I got a message saying they'll email me when my payment went through and I think it took about 30min to get the email.
---
Huh? I don’t care about the queues lol. Blizzard never listens. We’ve been telling them for years how to give us exactly what they want, and they fight us every step of the way.
---
It took me three hours to log in yesterday but I didn’t care. I just played other games while I waited lol

It is very heartwarming and welcome!!
---
No, it won't count you as afk until you it enters you into the character screen. I had a 4hr wait time last night so I took a nap and set a timer for 3.5hrs to sleep while I went through the queue.
---
ya i logged in an hour early for stalaag i was able to play as soon as it went live when my friends had to wait like 6 hours

Tauren Druid approached me in the barrens, handed me 6 refreshing spring water, buffed me with Mark of the Wild and said "Blessings of Elune be upon you," before running off into the sunset.

I'm currently queuing. Estimated time is 100min and I was wondering if I need yo make sure to move my mouse from time to time to avoid being disconnected whole queuing, or if I can safely go afk for 30min?
---
Yes, but here's why you're wrong:
---
&gt; Sounds like you're making up problems. Spanish people can play with whoever they want. That's not even remotely your call nor should it be.
---
Yes, you can play with whoever you want. But the Spanish players actually WANT their own servers, so instead of assuming we will *force* you in to your own server, it's just another option that others do not have. So instead of assuming, shut up instead.
---
There should be a .EXE in your wow folder
---
I am doing this too. Question, when will you log in the queue? If you get in and are still at work, how will you log in and stay logged in?
---
I don’t get why people don’t understand that blizzard just creating a crap ton of servers causes more problems down the line.  I’d rather a queue (25k last night) over a dead server 4 months from now.
---
Ashkhandi lol no sexual innuendos here.
---
Agreed, but the group-think mindset doesnt work like that once you are talking more than just 3 or 4 people. Most folks get attached and also dont want to risk splitting the party.
---
Some of my friends put long hours in yesterday/this morning and cant play again until saturday so they will be extra behind if the rest of us leave.
---
Did the exact same here :) was worth it
---
Last night on Blaumeux around 9pm CST there was a queue of roughly 9000, Guildie A joined it and had a 240 min estimated queue.
---
Guildie B disconnected shortly after, back to the login screen (of the Classic client, not [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) launcher) and was raging.  He logged back in immediately to character selection, his rage was replaced with jubilation. Guildie A still had 4000 ahead of him in queue.
---
Guildie who was on and leveling, was getting ready to go to bed, but wanted to install an addon, and was curious about testing this grace period, he closed out of his client completely, installed the addon, then logged back into the game, went straight to character select. Guilding A still waiting in queue.
---
If there isn't a grace period, than something with the queues is really fucked.
---
It was 60$ over the course of 6 months and it was from school... Im not even gonna get more of it.
---
Because they are slow
---
Right? And I just paid 10s for my Overpower, and gotta pay the wind master to Orgrimmar, so I better sell some stacks of leather, lol.
---
I have my characters named on Bloodsail but... I moved to Ashkandi last night because of the short queue. Had a lot of fun there.
---
For me it was ~1000 per hour, give or take. So it should be somewhere in the range of 4.5 - 5 hours. That was on Skeram though, and it was last night. It could be different now.
---
Very nice! Glad you were able to get in!

---
You’re not going to get anything done if you’re playing both at the same time, just pick one to play at a time
---
That was so fucking stupid. The way EU's been handled is braindead. I was just DCd after waiting for 4 hours, played for 5, and now I'm at a fucking 20k queue.
---
I was debating buying stock a few weeks ago, really should have.
---
idk i can log onto any wow classic server I wish...
---
It will get harder don't worry
---
I mean, the bulk of the Day One traffic is likely to be people who want to see what all the buzz is about. A good chunk of the current numbers probably *will* quit and go back to Retail after the "new toy" buzz wears off.
---
Last night I was fighting Boars outside Kharanos and a snow leopard jumped me and killed me. Those snow leopards killed me twice. Two Level 7 mobs, one boar and one leopard, and they still overwhelmed me twice. I'm having trouble seeing a Retail player sticking around long-term in a setting where that's possible.
---
Wow, the most stressed servers are having trouble. Must be an evil conspiracy.
---
New tech being tested for the first time on top of stressed not working perfectly. Blizzard must be criminal masterminds
---
If it is like in EU, that server would be 1hour queue in no time.
---
Yea, I've seen some stuff about grinding the last few levels on waterlords rep, so I guess it could be done. I don't know but week two will happen unless the servers explode.
---
ha the twitch stream is a good idea!

Thanks for the response!

How hard can it be to handle a few hundred thousand character transfers? LUL

Also you could probably get some sweet classic swag that's unavailable in retail

so is questie messed up for everyone? is there a fix?
---
That's my problem with Blizz's logic - they're basically stabbing themselves in the back now and frustrating the player base with huge queues because they're saying "yeah sometime down the road the subscriber count will go down and we won't need so many servers xD" It is asinine and illogical to cause such huge problems for your playerbase now because you're gambling that eventually your game won't be as popular - in fact I couldn't think of a dumber way to manage a game.
---
All I can say is, Blizz, good luck in Phase 2 when those high population servers aren't being "layered" anymore. I can already see what's going to happen - the completely avoidable problem (cramming too many people into a single server) is going to compound when they remove layering, and you're going to have Lv. 120 toons gloating on the forums nonstop about "BUH YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT LAYERING THO AND NOW THAT ITS REMOVED UR COMPLAIN xDDD" when the real problem is that Blizz has severely overcrowded their servers.
---
 4,500 is about 2-3 hours.
---
&gt;downside of having a server merged
---
Name collision.  Someone will lose their character name.
---
RPPVP servers currently have huge log in ques also. Anything but dead......
---
perfect thanks for the response!!
---
This was me telling all my friends not to switch servers while I leveled yesterday lol
---
I was waiting in Q for gehennas EU since 11.30 am, finally got on at 6 pm after 6.30hours q only to get kicked out not 20 minutes later, back to a 22k ppl and most likely another 6 hour q, it's really disheartening... I'm just lost for words at this point
---
I was on the character selection screen three hours before launch when there wasn’t even close to a queue.
---
I don’t think thats the case.
---
It is more likely someone who Dc’d and relogged within his grace period, thus making him bypass anyone in the queue
---
That’s not how that works

Yeah, I get it, I fished the fish in Lakeshire for a quest, I remember how frustrating it was, but my recollection was that fishing was frustrating from the start (even more so than down the road).

Yea same I was on 30 min before servers went up and had no problem logging in.
---
Classic Plus?
---
Like adding on more content to Classic?
---
No, you won't get disconnected while in a queue. But the afk timer kicks in once you get connected to the server.
---
I knos they did, but still. To less capacity...
---
I dont know who makes the decisions at Activision Blizzard, but that guy needs to get fired.
---
A few downsides. 
---
1. Names and guilds are no longer unique, so everyone has to have an affix server after their name (E.g. Bob-Herod). Is a pain for general problems, like guilds and invites.
---
2. Economies are combined. Ruins the stability of both economies, sudden increase of items flood the market. One server may also be ahead of another, and suddenly provide abundant items that aren’t otherwise available.
---
3. Servers feel less unique. Being part of Connected X server feels pretty bad, compared to being part of one specific server.
---
I had a queue to renew my sub. But at least I got my sub renewed so I could wait in the server queue for hours before giving up and going to bed.
---
No one said anything about paid transfers. Free transfers to a new locked server for half a day allows guilds and players to transfer and get names they want without worry. Legit costs blizzard nothing and helps sort queue problems

---
I went from 3000 to 1500 in a minute, then got stuck at 335 slowly creeping down until I jumped a hundred spots, before finally getting stuck at 10 for twenty minutes. Total time in queue was 1.5 hours and the estimated time was always under 3 minutes lol

I've seen Auctionator and an old version of Auctioneer listed on the addOn sites, but I have no idea they work. Your best bet is to probably try them out and see how it goes.

From what I’ve read medium pop is like classic high pop... so you should have plenty of people on even med pop servers and no queue.

Nope. One of the engineers at my last workplace convinced the director to buy them for our office and even most of the skinny guys hated them. They are not comfortable for sitting in periods longer than about 15 minutes, I have no idea how they have become so popular among gamers.

NA - Alliance - PVE (EST) 
---
I'm a returning player, but haven't played since TBC, never got to endgame on any of the alts I rolled, and barely remember anything about the game. So for all intents and purposes I'm starting from zero. I work a regular 9-5 but tend to game quite a bit in the evenings, and a decent amount on the weekends as well. 
---
Basically, I'm looking to play with a small group of people who are also as inexperienced as I am. When I played WoW initially I always really wanted to learn through trial and error and experience the game with others rather than be told how to do things by people who've done it all dozens of times. A lot of the fun for me comes from that mutual learning process and it's difficult to experience that if you're not playing at an MMO launch.. Which is why I came back to WoW for Classic. 
---
At the moment I don't have any interest in raiding at all; I've always enjoyed dungeons and small group content much more, as well as BGs from what I can remember. That could change somewhere down the line theoretically but atm I want to focus on leveling up and finding chill people to play and form social connections with. 
---
Not /too/ fussed about the server but I do want to play Alliance and I'd rather not have to battle long log-in queues. I've already made a couple characters on Westfall that I've been messing with so I guess I'm leaning a bit more towards that server than anything since I've got the names I want there.

BS. Vanilla didn’t have queues anywhere near this large if at all depending on the server.  These queues are many times larger than the total population of any vanilla server.

Now server crashes and lag were definitely abundant.

This, 20 min queue for Shazzrah at 7:30-8:00 this morning. 
---
200-400 min queue for Shazzrah at 16:30-17:00 (when I started queueing... probably much worse now).
---
Good. The only way the industry will take note that *this* is the kind of game we want, is if they can make money on it.
---
Don't look at low/med/high pops... all pops are higher than you think, the layers make the servers seem more empty than they really are, also at this very moment, a lot of people are sleeping/working and therfore the current state isnt indicative of actual pop.
---
Also if we look at what the devs said, they plan to have no servers feel empty, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
For a lot of people playing right now, Classic is definitely a new game...what are you talking about. Do you really think that everyone that is playing Classic right now played Vanilla before?
---
Yes. Leveling as a Warrior is incredibly slow simply because your ability to recover after combat sucks. First Aid and Cooking both help with this exponentially.
---
They will drop because of the poor preparation. Self-fulfilling prophecy.
---
Logged in on EU this morning around 8 am and there were 3 servers marked as high pop and all the rest were low pop including mine. Now they all have big ass queues.
---
We dont have this either because of layering... Ive never seen more then like 50 people at once EVER after leaving the starting zone.

Ideally you’d want two swords and go from there, but (and this is a big but) just make sure you’re upgrading your DPS based off your talent build. If you’re building a PvP then sell the sword and just wait to replace with daggers and vice versus for raiding.
---
From his asshole. Most of these people are too dumb to comprehend the scale of how many people are really trying to login and what would happen in the long-term if they just opened servers willy nilly. They made changes like layering and people threw a conniption about it. Imagine if they had instead kept everything 100% true to classic. Now that would be funny.
---
So basically i'm waiting an hour to finish work so i can go home and wait in a Q to get into a Q to get into the game?... worth it!
---
Ya, no. Asmongold had to stop playing on his stream with 150k people watching because he got dced and had an 8 hour queue.
---
Yup I did this, got to level 8 and then the server crashed on Stalagg and had to get in the queue which was not worth staying awake for. Back on today and the queue is 7k rn

This hits so close to home lol

It will be high pop by 8pm EST tonight. Then it will be full shortly after and you'll be told to reroll elsewhere, only to repeat the cycle again
---
Imagine waiting in line instead of just keeping moving and killing shit
---
its the best mmo
---
Happened to me as well.
---
 Completely new here, what the hell is skinning?
---
&gt;When we told them there weren’t enough servers and that the launch would be a disaster for queue times, they were assholes.
---
&gt;This response? They’re being assholes.
---
I interpreted this as you being unhappy about the queue times but I guess I was wrong, my bad.
---
Yeah, I hate how they handled this launch with the name reservations and everything. Why give us a chance to coordinate with friends and reserve names just to turn around and tell us we have to switch realms if we wanna play and risk not playing with friends/not getting the names we paid for
---
Their plan was implementing layers. Once they saw the response to name reservations, they added more servers. This is a fine balance, because they *can* add more servers, but until the populations stabilize and everyone gets a better idea of how many people will really stay on the server, you don't want to add too many, or you risk dead servers in 3 months.
---
I wonder if the servers are Virtual Machines that can be spun up or if they're still unique server blades.
---
Logged in at 5:31 PM est...got in at 11:45 PM =(
---
I love the fact that people are waiting in lines and being so polite. I've never seen anything like it, especially on a PvP server. It's really made the whole process of getting out of the starting zone so much easier.
---
You can gain places if people dc but if they get back in under grace period, you lose places.
---
There's no such thing as low pop right now. People blasted through an all nighter so it's likely low right now, but just for a bit.
---
Can't be getting addicted to the game now.
---
you get 1/3 of the xp though????
---
I read this and the comments. I love hearing other people say yea break up with him over a video game. Thats like breaking up with a girl that loves to do makeup because it makes her happy. We don't really know the details, but if a girl is ready to leave you over your hobby (that was an addition when you were a CHILD) then ok she's clearly not worth it. 
---
I had an ex who never let me play games for more than an hour ago and it was actually extremely depressing not being able to talk to my close friends from back home. We eneded up breaking up because "I didn't give her enough attention" Yet, my entire life revolved around supporting her. 
---
Dont ever let someone control you. 
---
Relationships are about compromising, you can def compromise with wow/gf time with a reasonable individual.
---
The monthly peaks average out to about 32k using steam stats for poe. Considering we know layers hold roughly 5k and servers have roughly between 3-7 layers. 
---
Yea it’s literally an entire game player base vs Herod basically
---
Well, they are not wrong. If you can't play the game, you will drop out eventually. It's like a suburban area asking the city council over and over and over for a playground for the kids, then the city council refusing to believe they actually want it. Then when they FINALLY give in and build this playground, it's placed on the entire opposite end of the city.. and when people don't go there they will say; We told you that you didn't want it!

I badly, badly wanted WoW Classic.. but I'm not about to sit and wait in queue for weeks on end. That's not what I signed up for and not what I paid my subscription for with my VERY limited funds at the moment.

None of the games you mentioned had this level of success.

Furthermore, you're comparing games that had a strong start because players didn't know if they'd like it or not, to Classic that players want to play *because* they know how it is.

Only weapons/shields.  You could never swap other peices.

no need to be sorry for me I just s\*\*t talking while being in queue :D but Thank's for compassion
---
After queuing around 4 hours and getting in queue windows just suddenly closes itself. I try to connect server again and I'm start of the queue again (20 000, estimated time 4-5 hours). Seems this isn't my day. Well going to try again tomorrow.

I wasn't even in EK, I was in org just getting my pet taming abilities ._.

https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294748/classic-wow-server-queue-times-na-oc
---
I mean maybe it's not that simple though. Me and my friends convinced our entire guild to switch to a new server two weeks ago, so we moved to a brand new server. Skeram. I waited in a 5 hour queue last night. Do we convince them to switch again now? Is that your solution? Or maybe the whole point of layers was to avoid this problem.
---
Pretty much what happened to me. We only had two PvP server at the start. Both around 15k queue so I started on one and played to lvl 6 until I went to sleep. Next day 24k queue. So I decided to start on the newly opened server. Hit lvl 6 again then took a lunch break. 6k queue again. There is already another server but I'm not playing against cause the queue will always be a problem some hours after server launches. I will just sit this out or not play at all. Wasn't that interested in classic and this is not helping.
---
The Joy's of parenthood mate lol 5 more years and my daughter can play lol
---
Yes, I think the ideal thing would be to release TBC after Classic ends and then transform Classic into Classic+ and let people pick themselves, both versions would be full with players.
---
ppl getting dc'd and reconnecting within their grace period
---
You can't reserve a spot
---
With you all the way, but why would this be brief? I think Classic WoW is going to continue to be AWESOME. It's going to be like Runescape Rd 2 where everyone goes back to the original and prefers it over the new content.
---
Happened to me too, but I still think it's true that people get a grace period even though we both missed out on it..

---
Exactly this. They're actively shooting themselves in the foot. They need to just open more layers per realm and offer transfers later down the road. At this point adding more servers won't even mitigate the problem as everyone's friend groups have put hours into a particular server already.
---
Flamelash now has over an 8k queue.
---
RN I have 86 copper.
---
They did move and now those people are stuck in4 hour queues. Then they opened new realms and now they have several hour queues.. your point is completely invalid at this point
---
Active users meaning people with paying subscriptions.  There cannot be more people playing the game than this number.
---
It may be insanely rare, but we had way more than 2 million concurrent users at one point in WoW.
---
My question is how many days of these queues will we have to endure.
---
!!!!!!!
---
I logged in at 5:00 my team so 6:00 east coast which would be close to peak. And then again at the same time that everyone else was complaining about the queues but nice try man
---
It says Medium on the server list right now, and I'm sitting in a 6k queue... Blizzard really fucked up with this server selection. They're banking on the vast majority of the playerbase being retail tourists who quit the game after a week.
---
I have just found a blue post about it, thankss
---
there is no &lt;1 hour queues in EU. They're all 5k queues. If I'm waiting 3 hours or more I might as well go on the realm all my friends are on

Yeah I agree with this. In high school I had 6 hours of class, a part-time job after school and homework and all that nonsense. Now I have 9 - 5:30 job and no obligations afterwards.

I had some random guy mail me a 6 slot bag. So nice!
---
The wait isn’t worth it. Herod isn’t anything better than this server. I’m extremely confident it will fill up here

I (think?) this may have only been true before servers were live. Now it’s dynamic based on how many are online. Obviously can’t confirm that tho.

I got my ass saved by random priests healing me while i run away from a failed pull at 10% hp. After that we buffed each other and did a few quests. Classic &lt;3

I mean it’s hard to blame them, no one wants to play on a dead server months from now
---
Thanks! I'll have to give this a try when I get home

yeah they could be kicking more ppl off for whatever reason they are doing that also. the whole EK got dc last night and they give no info. actually blows my mind how blizzard still treats their players like shit and don't prepare or prevent all this garbage.

Damn that’s rough!

Yeah seems like line has already been crossed

Same here. Funny as Hell!

I don't care how long the queues are, Fairbanks is my home; Now and forever.

i'm fine with a limit as long as the limit is higher than the hours i could realistically do in one sitting so if it's like 46h that's okay with me.

If the point is to combat anti afking there are better ways to go about doing that than forcibly disconnecting people tho.
---
Im on a medium pop server and its a 7-8k player que
---
I do, I added the “girlfriend” tag. Easy way to differentiate lol. This way I don’t mess up and text and girl from college also named steph
---
Have not hit a queue yet AMA
---
lol imagine the queues if free trials could play classic today
---
Because you said so?
---
At no point have Blizzard said « we’re going to merge low pop servers ».
---
And maybe they actually should say that so that people would have a reason to disperse and still not feel like they’re going to be missing out a year from now.

I started the qeue around 22.000 and had a BIG dump of 7.000 in a few seconds.  I'm waiting for about 3 hours and and timer is 11.000

Is that your mom's basement?

Yeah that’s been my plan. Working ok so far.

Seems like they’re allowing a layer or 2 and then forcing everyone else into the queue in an effort to spread people out
---
Yeah. And I'm trying to get around that
---
Who said they could fit 100s of thousands? I don't think anyone said that. They also explained the medium vs low vs high/full here: [Link](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294750/blizzard-explains-why-medium-population-classic-servers-have-login-queues)

Pally are godlike healer, and retri is one of the strongest class in pvp. (With blue honor gear and unstoppable force i was a match for a lot of aq40 and rank 14 people).

It's not that the aggro radius is large (aggro radius would be the distance between you and a mob the first time it turns on you), it's the leash that isn't reset properly.

---
Why is this sub classicwow and not wowclassic, like how the title of the game is?
---
I'm just derping around on whatever servers I can get on for at least the first few days. I'll pick my "real" server once the initial fustercluck dies down a little.
---
Exactly.
---
I actually just got in but I can't really play on my phone through teamviewer so idk what to do hahaha. I guess I'll just keep coming back and picking a class until I get home. Or I might just reqeue like two hours before I leave.
---
Sounds like a bug. Blizzard wants everything to be EXACTLY the same. Might be able to bring that back if the right devs see it.
---
Yes do it and don't waste time queuing lol. Blizzard have already said they're current servers on low holds more people than their original servers did at full. People are worrying too much. The full servers are going to be a pain for a long time.
---
So, your unabashed ignorance is remarkable enough to have singled you out as a "Trump supporter". It's both amusing and sad.
---
No way. It is your own fault if you are too stubborn to switch to a server without insane wait times. I could maybe almost agree if there wasn't enough servers to go around but there are, don't make your own problems somebody elses.
---
Anyone know if there's a queue for Deviate Delights atm?
---
You realise that it was due to community pressure that they promised to remove layering
---
This is the result of what people wanted and now other people are blaming them that queuetimes are too long etc...
---
medium population just means that compared to the high pop servers it has about 50-66% as many accounts as the most full one, doesn't mean that the population is actually is actually that small
---
It does, because you are unable to communicate with them. You are unable to create actual conversation with them. Which is what Classic is about.
---
Is there a good dps overlay?
---
They arn't forcing you to do anything
---
Still makes no sense though. If it’s medium / low pop there shouldn’t be a que, because ya know, low population...
---
The definitely have - the one community they claimed didn't have enough players to warrant their own server; the one community that only got a single server (maybe RP did too?), and the one community that didn't go "high" or "full" until the midnight hour...
---
Yep, it's split. But that's OK. Two medium servers, according to Blizz, would still have larger playerbases than the most full servers from 2006. In a way, this is a good thing. 
---
The real question is of faction balance, especially being a PVP server.
---
That's really shitty but I guess I can see why it would be difficult to get 5000 accounts to have priority to log back in immediately. There would still be a queue even if they all went to the front.
---
I was able to play 8 hours straight last night from the second the servers were all up got really lucky. Logged out to mess with some add-ons and when I went to get back on there was a 4000 player queue. Fiiiiine I guess I'll sleep.....ugh

---
The only paid services they are going to provide is Server transfers.
---
They might provide free transfer from High servers to low servers, but they are doing everyting possible to avoid server merging. So I wouldn't count on that.
---
Faction changes are not planned for the future
---
I'm loving my warrior. I mained a lock from Vanilla through BfA, and while I had lots of alts, Warrior is the one I never got around to playing. I'm loving it. It's forcing me to take my time, too, since I focus on first aid/cooking/fishing, not to mention taking different weapons out as I get them and keeping my skill up for all of them. It's gating my need to always plow through leveling, so it's a win-win.
---
15000 in queue, 60 minutes wait time 
---
14,000 in queue 519 minutes estimate wait time. 
---
Now I'm in some west coast server, and the 5 hours I invested on almost feels like a waste.
---
People were also begging for more servers, look how that turned out
---
&gt;Phase 1 (Classic Launch): Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon.
---
&gt;Phase 2: Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak.
---
&gt; Phase 3: Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Darkmoon deck drops begin.
---
&gt;Phase 4: Zul'Gurub, Green Dragons.
---
No word on expansions but I wouldn't count on it.
---
How fucking invested are you that you can't reroll on a new realm literally 16 hours after the game came out.
---
Even if you've been playing nonstop, rerolling and doing it again will have you further in a new realm by tomorrow.
---
They don't need transfers right now.
---
They need people to pick the lower queued realms.
---
Short term yes
---
They told you about queues. Literally your choice to play on the worldwide release of world of warcraft classic.
---
Oh, neat! The more you know. :)
---
Made a macro tab + auto attack with my G910 and spamming the shit out of that button helped me a lot.
---
I completely agree. I think people should move servers and I am thinking about doing so. I think a lot of people aren't right now because they fear that low pop means low pop like it did in 2004.
---
But that's not the case. Even the low pop servers are several times larger than the highest pop vanilla launch realms. The labels low, medium, and high stopped being associated with hard population numbers a long while back and became relative to the other servers. So Herod is high because it has a 25k and server X is low because compared to Herod, it only has a 3-5k queue. They have to had the hard queue caps because when they collapse all the layers into a single one, everyone will be on a single layer, albeit now spread across the world. So even the low pop realms are 3-5k above that hard limit...but they are low when compared to say Herod, etc.
---
Right? I get not wanting to play on a dead server 6 months from now, but they act like if You're not on Herod or Whitemaine, your server is going to have 16 people on it. Even medium sized servers can be incredibly close and get things done. It doesn't have to be full or bust.
---
(surprised pikachu face)
---
I booked today off work in order to queue for seven and a half hours and then get disconnected before even getting in.
---
I am paying Blizzard for this... \*SMH\*
---
Real chads cut everyone off, ultimately cause an accident and then create a 3 hour stall on the highway for everyone else while you get zipped off to the hospital
---
That monitor stand though .....  :)
---
Deviate delights has given me no problem so far
---
You can wait . Or does blizzard have a gun to you saying you have to play right now nerd
---
You're really boneheaded aren't you? Look at the Q times for EU realms
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294747/classic-wow-server-queue-times-eu?webhook
---
none of the PVP ones are under 6k. What do you want people to do? Not play the game?
---
Absolutely. But queues are going to disappear in a few weeks as the hype dies down (same as when Vanilla released). If having a better experience right now prevents you from enjoying the full potential of the game a few months down the line, it’s quite a dilemma.
---
what are you saying is broken...?  Weapon skills at that low of a level often level up 1 point per swing
---
None of the dps classes in classic have particularly difficult rotations. Maybe hunter, but even then.
---
On my server we lined up in parties of 5 and tried to see which group could make the straightest line. It was cute.
---
Does anyone know exactly how fade works?  I think I heard once that you get the threat back when the duration ends?  Does it reduce the amount of threat you generate during it or just what you had when casting it?  etc etc
---
well they gotta make the queues shorter somehow  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
ok thanks that was what i was scratching my head about.
---
how will my guts help this situation? brb buying a scalpel on prime now
---
That's a bit of a shame, but are you guys going to still be accepting people in a week or two if/when the queues are down to a reasonable level?
---
There was a post minutes before answering this
---
I get that. I’ll spend my time leveling a bunch of classes. I like the variety and leveling in classic was far more enjoyable and challenging.

To be fair their website is weird. The first link I clicked on to download gave me tukui instead.

yeah it's called LAYERING

This is why nobody likes RPers.

Literally. It took me 45 minutes in stalag to get 4 and less than half on kurinnaxx. Less spell lag too. Last night the queue on that realm peeked out at 1hour 15min.
---
Ok. Then it worked pretty well for me. Slowdown was noticeable at 35, but I wasn’t buffed with int. Is it random chance like fishing or a set curve? Maybe you just got lucky.

Comprehension issues

My friend has the same problem.

yeahhh.. that happends. Still 1000 times better than no quest helper.

Lmao, no need to concede. We’re all on the same page about how dumb this post is.
---
Maybe the hype gave me super high expectations. I just wasn't impressed.
---
On classic wow do you think increased gpu will make a big difference?
---
I was on like an hour ago and there was 13 low pop realms.
---
whitemane had a smaller queue but it took longer for people to log in. I think blizzard is artificially increasing login times to spread the population out.
---
I think they will allow server moves.
---
I've never noticed it, but even though I had a huge queue to get on Blameaux last night I never had to compete for mobs till this morning when I was looking for leper gnomes to whack. 
---
Overall the experience once I got in was incredibly smooth and I never felt lonely or crowded
---
Depends on the server. It definitely happened tho.
---
Where
---
I got a 3h long class today and GF who never touched WoW before is mid racking up the repair bill so I don't have to logg out. True love I say, true love.
---
Sounds like you have options and don’t want to exercise them
---
It's fine to strafe with mouse tho and personally i wouldn't recommend guides to anyone. If you are the type that likes using guides you don't need a recommendation to do that and if you are the type that doesn't like using guides you might end having a lesser experience if you start using one just because people are implying that it is somehow necessary.
---
Permanently split the server(s) in 2 and merger it(them) back later on it when things stabilize
---
Why did you think this mmo launch would be any different to any other mmo release, ever?
---
No, Kurinaxx is kind of the new overflow hardcore pvp server. Heros is busted
---
This reads like an ad 🤔
---
Honest question, where did you got that 3k from?
---
Also, i bet there's someone in Blizzard that is being paid for figuring this out, so they probably have some data to back them up (I would have if my butt was on the line), so maybe those 95% are expected? Who knows
---
I really really doubt Blizzard is allowing a fuck up to happen in such a lucrative investment, cause holy balls people are eager to play classic
---
My comment was that Blizzard used layers as a method to address the giant populations at startup. The subtext (that I guess I should have made explicit) was that they are doing this so that once tourists leave, they don't have dead servers. That was the intention. Whether it meets that will remain to be seen, especially when queues last night were sometimes 10x the vanilla server cap.
---
The other part of my comment was that more servers were added to keep up with the demand that they saw during character creation. They added even more new servers yesterday. However, adding more servers risks dead servers as time moves on.
---
None of these are my positions. These are all things that Blizzard stated. I believe they've also stated that server transfers will become available at later stages.
---
Their rage will be no match for our unrelenting justice!
---
Roll a diff realm- they said they would likely do character transfers once numbers even out. I did Ashkandi, 5 min queue, no lag. Leveled to 10 last night in ~4 hours
---
Are you fucking kidding
---
Thank you for queuing you will now be placed in a queue to enter the queue
---
Wow so le deep. You mean to tell me being a kid with entire summers of free time isn't the same as being an adult with a full time job? Well fuck man I'm learning a lot today. God I love this community, teaching me that growing up may actually have an effect on who I am.
---
Apples and oranges
---
&gt; If medium pop servers did not reach full capacity
---
One thing we've learned is that the realm population indicator is relative, not absolute. Some realms had such large queues (mid 20K+) that it threw the calculation for the realm pop off. Every server bought online before launch had large queues, but some were larger than others. My server was listed as 'Medium' but still had a 5K+ queue when I logged in. Relative to 20K, 5K is medium.
---
tl;dr on that - Just about every server was actually Full even if the population listing was 'Medium'.
---
&gt; each server is supposed to be a mega-server capable of holding 100s of thousands , so here's what's confusing.
---
And likely the servers were handling 100,000 or more players each, with 10 or more layers on each server. Layers won't add infinite capacity to a realm though. There's still going to be a bottleneck on the realm database updates etc. Can you imagine what the servers and/or the queues would have looked like without layering?
---
I think there has to be some sort of a grace period when it came to DCs and logouts. I selected a new realm after having Skeram say "World server is down" for 30 minutes straight, and I skipped the queue.
---
The layers honestly don't help much. Some quests still take 30+ minutes to complete because there's so many people competing for it.
---
Yeah, I think, as owner of a franchise, it still probably hurts to be told your customer wants what was made  15 years ago more than what is being given today...
---
There's the prideful pushback at first, but the fact its released today is proof that they thought it had serious merit to fund it and make it happen.
---
You 100% can play, they opened up new servers for a reason.
---
This is the game I came to love.
---
Yes I know, but the point isn't that people are too invested now, it's that they're going to be invested later, and they're scared to pick the "wrong" realm. The point of this solution isn't that a lot of people are going to use the transfer option, it's that people might find a sense of security in the existence of that option, and therefore might choose the servers with a lower population.
---
Just teamviewer :)
---
Nah, these people were there for hours.
---
As I said you paid for game time for retail wow which you can still currently access good luck
---

Bloodsail Buccaneers has been fine. I know it’s “RP” but it’s a great community so far!

Good guilds won’t migrate to the spanish realm anyway because they know those realms will be empty before the end of the year so they stay at EU realms
---
What? More in JavaScript, there is no IF condition in HTML
---
Finally got my 4 bags, god bless skinning and selling leather, was pretty easy to get 👌🏼
---
Layers have absolutely nothing to do with queuetimes.
---
Yeah the servers opened up at 5:00pm my time. I played for 10 hours. Slept, woke up, and then logged in about 10am my time (admittedly people with work/school are busy) and had no queue. I get that it’s not normal and I’ve definitely over estimated how many people were effected. But the larger realms, blizz told us to expect it so I don’t feel as bad for them. 
---
You clearly have a lot of anger stored up so I’ll just let you be. Hopefully you have a better experience going forward
---
i just checked every medium realm and they all have queue, didnt check the low ones because they are rp
---
Thats not even close to being a line, thats like a thread of hair
---
Well, I mean, the queue already last an entire day, so you're probably going to have to queue on friday to start playing on sunday.
---
This comment reeks of stupidity. Of course everyone is trying out classic on launch you twat, itll die down.
---
&gt; I'm glad you agree with me.
---
We clearly are not agreeing on what a "healthy population" is. My position is that private servers have demontrated that there will be a healthy population no matter what; you are expecting who-knows-what to deem it to be a healthy population.
---
&gt;I don't understand this. How is this bad faith and pushing goal posts?
---
First, because WoW Vanilla is not working on hype at all. Hell, it didn't even have a marketing campaign for it; no advert outside of a few ads on Twitter and that's basically it. Compare it to any game actually working on hype.
---
Second, because hype works as an argument for games that people don't know. Transpose what you said to another subject to help you dissociate the argument. Imagine that I'm trying to sell you two cars: the first car is an unknown car. You never drove that car. Everything you know about that car is what I've accepted to show you; I've shown you cool ads of it driving in the mountains, of it flawlessly surfing lines in the distance, making you hear the cool sound of the engine. It may be a crap car in the end, or it may be a good one, but you know nothing about it: all actual desire that you may have to buy it as been generated by me, as a seller. I generated hype, and that hype generated a will in you to buy the car independently of the final quality of said car.
---
The second car, you drove the same model for 5 years back in 2004 to 2009, except I'm selling you a brand new model. I have not shown you any advert, **nothing**. I'm not even telling you to come to the store. Yet, you come to the store and buy it: you buy it on information and feelings that you generated by yourself, while using the product 15 years ago. You enjoyed that car, and while the new ones have merit, you still prefer the old car.
---
It is impossible to pretend the two situations are alike. The comparison is so insultingly wrong that it feels that you are of bad faith. My bad if you aren't, and maybe you needed to see it from this angle to understand it, but it literally is impossible to talk about hype for a product that saw little to no advertising and that is literally a 15 years old product that people are coming back to because they associate very good moments and feelings to it.
---
Classic at it fullest
---
That's not true. 4 hours, still 5000 in queue. Won't get to play today
---
Rattlegore and Kirtonos don't have queues.
---
Cheers I’ll take a look
---
Go in blind and try to figure it out by yourself. If you have any specific questions I’d ask someone randomly in the world or maybe google it. 
---
A pure playthrough will be most enjoyable. Don’t look at all this “race to 60” stuff it’s not how real classic WoW is. Just pace yourself and do whatever you think you should and learn from your mistakes. 
---
One tip I have is that dying really has no consequences besides having to walk back to your dead body from a graveyard. Don’t be scared to do something risky.
---
&gt; This is why a lot of people are going to drop now
---
Why? Because they chose to roll on an overcrowded realm and then were shocked there were queues despite Blizzard warning them for days that there would be? That's not Blizzard's fault lol
---
The fact that he unironically reads the forums is enough to gauge this person's mindset.
---
What is so special about Herod ?
---
Chrome Remote Desktop.
---
I logged into the queue around lunch time to see how long the wait was. Harod is ~4 hours so it should pop right around when I get home.
---
There’s always trade chat :D
---
It existed one year before the ClassicWoW announcement. People have been playing private servers, yes, but weren't they almost universally referred to as "Vanilla", right?
---
If you are going to try "WoW" classic isn't really where it shines. It's a game released in 2004 if you are comparing it to a modern shooter (instead of MMO) it would be like comparing BF5 with the first Far Cry.
---
Literally none of those things actually matter, at all
---
Yeah, I really don't know how they could make it work properly, that's why I said "I wouldn't count on it."
---
I do enjoy classic, not as much as retail. It is called liking both.

The que picture is wrong

It's no longer up for debate.  We have our server.  Good luck to yours.  You reap was you've sewed.
---
I was in the same layer pretty much for 7 or 8 hours from Deathknell(Undead start area) to Tirisifal Glades, to Undercity for some quests/turn-ins, and back to Tirisfal.
---
I saw some of the same names over and over in general chat and one someone I grouped with on a single mob kill quest in Deathknell when I was level 3 I saw again completing a quest at level 10 in Tirisifal about 5 hours later.
---
No...

Actually he wasn't but nice try pushing your weird hatred for some dude you don't know.

clean your screen, you plebe

Now this is the quality content I came here for. If people are gonna complain make it good at least.

Is it sad when redditors are coming up with galaxybrain shit and Blizz devs are throwing feces at the server room wall.

Thank you for replying. Your comment will now be placed in a queue and will be visible after estimated time: &lt;RANDOM NUMBER PLACEHOLDER&gt;
---
I made ~10m gold from remoting into WoD and doing the missions on every toon. The amount of salvage crates I opened was mind blowing.
---
You pay game time for retail,  classic is a bonus included
---
Exactly. Not allowing 30,000 players to cram into Herod doesn't mean the launch was bad
---
Wanted to send to my friend still in queues (alternatively: I’m a sick, sick man who doesn’t care if it’s on a phone or through a screenshot)
---
I joined a new server with friends at launch... Started playing at 8pm and had no inturptions untill I went to bed.... Everyone wants to play on the same servers...
---
I get it tho, but I'd gladly pay to transfer later if my server doesn't work out... Rather play now
---
Then move off pvp... not hard
---
&gt;Why didnt blizz warn the people on the full servers that this would happen.
---
You must be joking, am I right?
---
For those wondering, it's Razorgore EU. A Medium populated PvP realm, one of those that went live just a few hours prior to launch.
---
I roll on a pvp server and I'm not really a fan of pvp. I just like the threat of it happening in open world, if that makes sense.
---
There is a Blue post on this.
---
Eating crow, when it means making more money than initially expected, is hardly an unenviable position.
---
How is the community?
---
Hotspot
---
you must be US
---
you do understand that   low pop server will be dead in 1 month after hype is over, and there will be no character transfers.
---
good luck finding a party for anything...
---
I mean, my group of east coasters specifically chose Fairbanks (west coast) because it was the least talked about and populated pvp server during the build up. We did everything we could with the information to choose the least populated server and still were sitting in 9k+ queues.
---
Has to be bug or something you did wrong.
---
The game will be just fine despite the autistic squealing going on over - *gasp* - an overcrowded blizzard launch
---
They should hire you to do their projections
---
They also could have locked new character creation on ultra high pop servers after a certain point to drive people to new realms.
---
I feel the same way on Blauxmeux. No queue time but I know one day it will be dead
---
I got lucky in beta and had two bags drop for me. No such luck so far in release.
---
I plan on taking my time though, so I might just mine a bunch of copper and AH it and buy the largest bags you can off the vendors in cities.
---
Which reminds me, do they have the City Quatermasters in that sell 16 slot bags at revered or was that a post Vanilla thing?
---
Yea I'm hoping we don't have to deal with it forever
---
Have you heard of this thing called a "search engine"?
---
Well, some of my g-mates are lvl 20+. Were 120 people. There is no way we can move.

If in 2 months when they are trying to get rid of layering and there will still be 4.5 hours all day long, than free server transfers will be offered I am sure.
---
So Joanasworld.com has the best guides imo for speedlevelling in WoW. The first levels of 1-13 are free.
---
Joanasworld charges $5 a month for the guides but they are written by the guy who set the World Record Speedrun for 1-60 in WoW Vanilla, and the $5 goes to him creating more guides and his heart surgery, so that’s pretty neat.
---
You also have Zygorguides.com who charge $7.99 and are more generic and non-linear. They also have an AddOn you can install to help. They have guides for BfA Goldmaking and Levelling and Classic WoW Goldmaking and Levelling.

Your not alone! I fucking love the idea of an alternate timeline!
---
Streamlining the experience created a sudden drop in immersion.
---
Arguably, one of the best feature of wow was immersion of their huge world. Anything that "skipped" through it or drew a stright line through parts of it took away from that.
---
Crab parts was easy, trying to snipe Zalzane before the other 30 people there did...that was frustrating! But yeah feel free to let go of a lot of those starter zone quests. You miss out on some XP and some white items but that's about it. You can make it up by farming mobs elsewhere, which you are probably gonna have to do at some point while the starter level logins are high and quest mobs and items are on farm.
---
If you want to play damage dealer to mage.
---
If you want to play healer go priest.
---
This is actually a much simpler issue than you might think it ought to be.
---
wait in queue for 5 hours, play for 1 hour and get DC'd, interesting enough, my squad mate also got dc'd at the same time, so i didnt feel picked out or chosen
---
This might be true for some but was not for me, I got dc with my entire layer
---
My computer broke 4 years ago. I ordered a new one for WoW classic. Won't show up till september 8th. I was up most the night thinking about what I'm missing out on and if some asshole stole my name.
---
"I'll log on during my lunch break, I bet everyone else is at work"
---
&gt;Still 6000 in queue
---
Is he the type of person that buys mounts and pets with real money?
---
Yea it’s a pain who knows where we will be at in 5 weeks but ppl want more servers ya know
---
That's not what he is talking about.
---
Are these Canadian servers?  Herod was a free for all
---
I find that hard to believe when it is happening constantly.
---
What is Incendius NA server now? Anyone?
---
I'd upvote but there's a queue for that
---
You still have years to actually play, but how many times do we get the honor of standing in an actual classic queue?!
---
You have a good point
---
Comeon, you can state you opinion without resorting to harassement. Pretty low of you.
---
Bruh...you started the logical fallacy by implying they wouldn't merge servers because "they didn't back in the day". Remember that? I used your own logic and all you just did was criticize *your* logic.
---
You lucky bastard
---
Nope, tried it with mh got buff. Right clicked buff off of me. Took off mh tried it again no buff
---
Thank you. Obviously I still don't need a girlfriend. Problem is now solved.

**What I'm Looking For**
---
A smallish guild (around 75-100 active members) that has a focus right now on community and helping each other level and run dungeons. I plan on taking my sweet time to 60 so I'm not in a rush, but raiding eventually would be nice.  
---
My ideal raid environment would be one where members are not expected to be present every week, but are expected to show for the raids that they do sign up for (within reason, life happens obviously). I have no experience with Classic raids, so I'm not sure what kind of progression a casual guild can expect to achieve but ideally we'd still make progress even if it's slow. I'm maining a druid and would like to raid as a healer. I can't comment on how much time I'd have to dedicate to raiding, but I can probably swing one night a week for the most part.  
---
**About Me**
---
I'm a late-twenties returning player that mainly played during TBC. I raided in a semi-hardcore guild that progressed at a comfortable pace to the beginning of Black Temple before WotLK released and cut our progression off. I quit a few months after that because I'm not a fan of change and WotLK just felt off to me. Now I'm back, but trying to steer clear of that all-consuming addiction that I fell into last time since now I actually have a life and don't want to lose that lol. I'm good-natured and easy-going but still like to have fun, so hopefully I can find a guild with some like-minded folks :)  
---
If you think I'd be a good fit for your guild, either reply to me here or message Rainsage in game.  
---
**Cheers!**
---
Very WoW-like, unsurprisingly.
---
:((
---
I'll look into TeamViewer. Thanks!
---
Oh
---
Bro don't let people know about our secret Deviate club.
---
With a name like Pwnisher, would you expect any different?
---
Trust no one
---
I got on at launch last night, had an hour to play before two hours of work. Came back to a ~45min wait. Hopped right on this morning after maint; everyone was having DC issues but those issues disappeared within 45mins.
---
That must be a bug. Ability to cast spells are independent of your equipment being on or off.
---
Countdown to classic. Find it on spotify afaik.
---
&gt;Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics.  Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch ...

Alt F4 and you’ll be able to go right into your character screen again and you’ll get right in. Promise. Had this happen for 2 hours last night, relogged and it worked right away. There is a DC grace period
---
Pretty much what we did, too. Locked ourselves in by using our alts to help hold names for folks who couldn’t do the name reserve. Realized that there was no turning back from Fairbanks then.
---
charges usually go to pending when using online transactions, even with a debit card.

So I just re-read what I said and holy dhit it does 😂. Was by no means intentional. But for real tho, it's super easy to use. I knew stuff like this existed but just haven't tried it. The imprisonment joke was a BC reference.. was hoping someone caught it.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath on server mergers.  Retail has been in need of server mergers for the smaller servers for years but they haven't done one since like 2014.  Too many people cry that it's a 'dead game' when they do mergers.

You guys complaining about que times realize this game is out for forever right? Be patient, your not racing for world first lvl 60. It’ll settle in a couple days and you’ll get in and then be complaining about crowded zones or low drop rates lol.

Welcome to classic
---
So basically what you're trying to say is, all servers are full but the low/medium/high actually shows how much additional queue people are waiting in queue on that particular full server , is that it ?:p

Roll a not full server maybe

---
Mulgore was completely empty. Barrens barely had any competition. I've barely grouped with anyone for quests. It feels like a lonely single player game exactly like retail but with more queues. It's a shame.
---
Watch it! Or your server gets Full
---
Believe what you want, plenty of people keep getting DC’d.
---
Now this is neat, if only someone could make a bot that pulls the API info.
---
I know it doesn't work like that, but the question was a theoretical one: if you could do it, Why would you.
---
You not getting any karma when you don’t use paragraphs
---
I don't think they publish the numbers for the different populations, but honestly - pick a low server.
---
Are you worried it will be an empty server? If so, don't. It will *eventually* be medium or even high in the future as a lot of people will pick that one to start over the next few days/weeks.
---
I hate asmon?
---
You know him?
---
Wow thats a ton of assumptions prick
---
tanking for 5 mans definitely but most likely not for raids. Maybe an offtank for some encounters, but if you happen to get a spot raiding as feral it's most likely cat dps.
---
I tried but there was maintenance
---
Idk about all these leveling guides, they do not take into account the fact that some quests should just be skipped due to insane competition for certain mobs.
---
&gt;The story has to match Blizzard’s business model so your character is rushed. 
---
Wat? They would make MORE money if it was slowed down not rushed. 
---
Overcrowded =/= community.
---
I was in queue for 6 hours, including time when i slept about 2 hours, so must be your internet or something?
---
You gave up after only 20hrs?
---
Low pop servers are still the same as this
---
Glad these are back, so atmospheric!
---
Trick was to login around 520, and keep rejoining Fairbanks through the change server menu, until 530 hit or you got in a que
---
I think they will be in the ball park in terms of the number of people who come in kick the tires and leave.   There will be a number of folks from Retail who try to "do both" one will lose.  Its a release people, it will be like this...
---
^it's just a model
---
Wonder which one will be the line into area 51
---
People like you are the reason the queues take hours

i agree

Is there now a difference when you said that?I believe no.
---
I would advise you to buckle up, be a man and stand up for your actions-Nobody forced you to play the game and wait for queues and yet you bought the game.
---
There are hundreds of thousands of people frustrated like you and having to wait 8 hours queues, me included.
---
Now shut up and wait like everyone else.

good luck affording the flight! lol

Where do I find the screenshots?

I did it too, brother. I did it too.
---
Loved having people whisper me and ask me for directions for quests and then watching them enthusiastically run off into the distance
---
^ this seems like whats actually happening, could skip queue once after a DC (which I think was my internet), could skip queue. Other time when i guess whole layer crashed (me, my friends) we were at end of the queue.

I mean shroud is a huge WoW nerd. Granted that's one streamer. But with the shit state of retail I found myself playing mobas and BRs more in the past few years.

Every server has a queue, smartass.
---
They have. It’s a possibility that they will look into expansions. Depends on the community. I’d imagine there is a good chance they will develop classic. Too much money to be had.
---
All ranges should just run up and invite us warriors. We’re friendly folk. Just slow and still growing.

You can have the imp recast blood pact. See if you get the buff then. Are you in range of the imp?

Asks for classic, complains when they don't make changes. Pick one and stop bitching.

Every PvP server has a queue so you're wrong.

Green level 9 shield? Sell that! That's like 5 6 slot bags! lol
---
I just wanna know how many days until I can reliably hop onto Grob at around 5pm with no queues.
---
But they also said that:  
---
&gt; Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.

So a **full** server now probably gets closer to 8-10k
---
It's still a lot of people expected to drop, i admit, that would be close to 50%
---
But it's more realistic
---
Yeah BC was my jam. WotLK was great up through Ulduar then they shit the bed with ToC. ICC was great but the damage was done with ToC when the community thought that’s was raids were. Then when you wiped on any boss from any raid there on out just once the group fell apart due to impatient/inexperienced raiders.

I try to throw fortitude on passing adventurers when mana allows.

I accept them immediately, every time.

Yup he proved once and for all that not all wow
---
Players are ugly nerds.
---
Are they separate from WoW modern add ons? I'm wondering where to search. I use Minion
---
I did the same and got in after about a dozen tries. I don't think it has anything to do with closing the game.
---
Looks so doomguardable
---
Well yes but actually no
---
the irony is, I choose a low pop server to avoid queues. Logged off for a shower this afternoon while server was low/medium, and it was full when I got back ;S
---
Wolves can buff melee and owls/bats can debuff enemy physical dmg.
---
Pretty sure he didn't say it would disrupt the community, but just that longevity was a concern and it was better to stay on the side of caution. Login queues suck, dead world's suck harder.

Actually I'm dumb as hell, these numbers are from last night.

Seriously, asks for classic than bitches about it being classic. If you want to play go play so bad go fucking play BFA.
---
Kritonos seems to one of the ones with a lower que. Pop over there if your goal is to play the game.
---
My lock strat. Getting the medallion in durotar even with our group of 5 people doing that was attrocious. There was probably 50+ people in that circle and even more trying to make a line
---
Kromcrush is legit
---
Hunter is probably the best class in world pvp if managed well (they have a real high skill cap), with 41 yard range and a good amount of cc if you are good is nearly impossible for the opponent to get you.
---
Warlock are good too; demo is strong as hell and affli and destro do a lot of dmg, plus you have an insane amount of cc.
---
It’s the nostalgia. There’s much more to do in retail and vanilla wasn’t that good to begin with.
---
It’s interesting how slowing things down and making something grindy is fine for classic but people whine about it in retail.
---
Nobody is stopping them from being social in retail, nobody has taken away their ability to have a make immersive experience. It’s all in their heads.

It’s really fun to watch

Me. Right now. Gahh....1.4 hours to go
---
Seems like the servers and game engine can handle loads of players without the lag show we had during vanilla

So many Vanilla fans on this sub swore to me up and down that queues and unplayability were a crucial part of the experience. You really think these nostalgia elitists are all shills?

&gt; “What? **Server queues preserve the integrity of the classic experience.** I'm not so impatient that I can't wait a short time to play the game, knowing the wait makes it that much better for everyone. Have some respect for the game and stop being selfish.”

There are still low pop servers that I can get into easy on EU and if it is a  q its only like 10 min clearly there are still servers to play on without q

dead realm

Where did you find this info? :)
---
If we joined a low population server yesterday in order to avoid the hours long queues, will they merge the other low population servers down the road? Or am I wasting my time leveling on a low pop server that could die off ? Should I just take the long wait times to get into a server? ahhh I dont know what to do
---
&gt;Same. My friends and I reserved names on Herod and Fairbanks on 8/12, but with hours-long queues on the more populated servers, we decided to roll horde on Kirtonos instead. Played for a few hours there and the other players seemed really nice and competent. Hoping it'll stay alive and strong!
---
Yes, I am flagged. But what's wrong? And why even this option a thing in PVP realm? I thought everyone on PVP realm forced to be in pvp mode...
---
Well they’re not going to be increasing the caps on the servers, so unless people would really like to queue (or the playerbase dies down a bunch) I’d say it’ll be fine.

if the datamined data of unique wow subscribers are true, classic probably matched or doubled retails current active player count

Even if it conflicts, retail has had server names as "surnames" for years anyway. There are many other ways to sort out name conflicts regardless.
---
Seems a bit silly to have people unable to play at all, on release day of all times, and try to defend it as the right choice. It seems pretty likely (and/or obvious) that Blizz was either unprepared, or knew what was about to happen and didn't act due to being too cheap, or wanting to inflate the appearance of demand (which is insane because it was obvious WoW Classic was going to be a hit).
---
Bit of a shame really that it looks like the Dev team put quite a lot of effort into this, and the big day has been spoilt by mismanagement. (Then again it is Activision, this isn't a new story).
---
Checked like 5 minutes before and all were full, then that one got low.
---
Chrome?
---
What do you think I am? Some billionare with a mega super computer running at absolute zero?

They can’t offer transfers until some servers remain empty at peak times, which they have not demonstrated yet.

---
hahaha you're such a twat honestly.
---
For the umptieth time, it's not as simple as putting up a few stickies because you have people that come back together from classic from everywhere.
---
For example for me I have friends from retail, old friends that havnt played in a decade, friends from different games, RL friends, people from discord.
---
Organizing where everybody wanted to go took time because you had to talk to the various groups and figure out what everybody wanted to settle on and not everybody still played/had played wow, only the contrary.
---
Now thats the situation for me where I tried to get as many people alligned as possible.
---
Now on top of that, add that a vast majority of those people were in the exact same situation: trying to get as many of their friends alligned to roll on the same server.
---
Because of the way blizzard handled this, there are people I know who didn't know that the people I play with actually changed community and because of that they and their friends are on a different server now.
---
Now if all those people have to move, we have to go through the same process while on top of that comes the element that people are more hesitant because many already put some work in their character. So maybe if I don't care and just create a new character, the probability of everyone involved in the initial planning not caring slinks significantly. 
---
And I hope you can at least guess what the result would be: the people you want to play with get spread out more and you don't get to play with your friends.
---
K
---
If it's anything like osrs they will not say a damn thing. They will acknowledge how popular it is and that's it. Let's hope microtransactions don't make their way into classic
---
This gave me anxiety.
---
I am on a medium server with a 11k queue. That's honestly ridiculous since i chose a low pop to escape queue times. How exactly can a medium pop server have queue times at all?
---
What's the Whitemane wait right now?
---
And I'm still not sure if I should leave since my friends refuse to leave herod. I'd rather not play by myself. Especially since it's my first time playing WoW.
---
Ullr on Zandalari Tribe is forever a line cutter.
---
I switched from Firemaw to Ashbringer. From 20k queue to 4k, at least I get to play a bit before bed and hopefully it won't be smacked tomorrow.
---
The real problem here is why you feel so strongly about that.
---
How's life with autism?

How is it lame? If anything its awesome. Instead of chaos people chose organization and fairness. Just like riding a roller coaster you need lines otherwise people would just be pushing each other over trying to hop on the ride first. The people who waited the longest might not get a chance to even get on the ride because of all the chaos.
---
How do i pick what professions I want. Can't figure it out for the life of me
---
Or they could just open more servers...
---
My question is why are people so stuck on a certain server? 
---
I'm not understanding having to make characters on the high/full servers instead of just going with a smaller one. 
---
I mean they'll each create their own communities within themselves, I went to Ashkandi yesterday, started leveling stoked on that. 
---
I understand if friends went onto a certain server, but then why not switch? You'll all be playing together anyway?
---
Queues were a thing but what *isn't* a thing this time around is the client crashing, queuing again, getting DC'd mid queue, queueing again (having lost your place), getting in, making char, client crashing during load (or hanging), rinse and repeat until you finally get in and rubber band all over the fucking map, or get stuck looting a wolf and then sliding on your knees all over the map, etc. 
---
Game is far, far more stable this time around.
---
Tbh when I watched him I just thought he was normal and boring. But he was running off of 0 sleep so maybe he lost some of his character lol
---
I'm wondering how the server tech works, once we all move outside the starting zone and spread out more people allowed online? Since they moved from hard servers to cloud servers I imagine it's somewhat different.
---
Ya i was way wrong lol
---
there will never be 90% of the player base in naxx.
---
layering
---
They may have not been doing well with income from players but buying additional servers to accommodate extra players twice was the nail in the coffin for them.
---
For me it's the social aspect. Without group finder you have to actually go out and seek other players in order to group up. Also gear is very important in vanilla, getting those purples that matter is an amazing feeling, while in retail they throw epics at you by the chest full and you get disappointed because it didn't titanforge or have a socket on it, etc.
---
kind of makes it a catch 22 though when they refuse to open the realms until post-launch after the point of no return. Especially if people were trying to coordinate with a large amount of guildies.
---
Melee classes auto upgrade hotbars. Maybe some spells will not be but I know on warrior I can’t downrank if I wanted to
---
I am also a casual and I do mind the queue, because I paid for access to the game. It wouldn't matter if I wanted to log in for 5 mins to fish in Elwynn. What I do is my own fucking business. Their obligation is to provide the service you are paying for. These aren't your friends, this isn't a fucking favor they are giving you, you are paying for this shit service.
---
That's the worst. If only your body could have held out a bit longer. And yeah I so want to call in sick at least one day, but the amount of work would stay the same so I'd have to kill myself to get it all done. Oh well. At least it's a 3 day weekend with labor day.
---
You have to communicate with others to get somewhere.
---
Leveling is actually fun and has a feel of progression with the talent tree.
---
World PvP is fun without flying mounts.
---
Layers
---
Beat me to it, updoot
---
Had a 6 slot drop at level 3. My PUG buddy gave me a grats! 
---
Really enjoying these circa-2005 vibes so much. Even general chat was mostly pleasant and polite. 
---
What game is this!?
---
Nah, that's all 20/20 hindsight. 
---
The fact is, when realms start to die out in a year you'll be part of the same group of people hypocritically criticizing Blizzard for opening too many realms at launch.
---
You'll be just as easily complaining that “I don't like server mergers, but now it's required because of server mis-management.”
---
Oh good. I guess I've forgotten some things.
---
I’m a priest but I don’t know what talents to get. Help pls :(
---
Additionally. Look at the queues. Had they spun up a few more servers last night. All those people that WANT to play on the more populated servers might mess around on the new ones. But then when queues drop in a week, they are going to move over to the servers they wanted to in the first place. Then you end up with a bunch of low pop/empty servers.
---
This launch went about as I expected. And, maybe an unpopular opinion, this launch went really well.
---
"This is the classic I'm waiting a year and a half for"
---
*You are 7,890,661st in the queue*
---
Glad he’s talked to everyone to make that assumption but I like it because I felt like a real adventurer with a since of exploring, danger, and being social. I love deeper feeling rpgs and that’s something that they got away. Yeah it wasn’t super deep but it felt way more deeper than it does now.
---
I feel you. I first rolled PVE and decided I want taht to be my off server because the co worker i work with is less than depoendable and i rolled it for him. So I went with PvP and I only want to go Whitemane but holy shit at the queue times. But Blau seems boring and Fairbanks seems a bit less than boring but still Whitemane is gonna be poppin
---
Eat shit salty redditor.
---
The. Leave the chat?
---
If the later crashes there is no grace period
---
A bold move. I go 11 into disc to get Inner Focus ASAP so Devouring Plague is always free! 😬
---
Using the baby monitor for other things isn't neglect. A one year old shouldn't need a baby monitor to begin with. So it is likely that it was stored away and they're now getting a chance to use it again.
---
No queue on Kirtonos from like 3am to noon today.
---
At this point it probably would be faster to just level a new character, it's been less than 24 hours after all.
---
I think every class is a bit of a struggle around that level, because enemies are getting tougher and you still only have a couple talent points.  Don't neglect your weapon, even though you're a caster you need to hit things too.  If you're finding upgrade staves or daggers instead of maces you can learn to use those weapons from weapon masters, but make sure to practice with them a bit on weaker enemies to get the skill up.
---
I suggest taking the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Undercity, and then do some questing in Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest for a while.  They quests will be lower level and thus easier but still decent XP and you get a change of scenery.
---
Meanwhile on Ashbringer (EU) all of the players are toxic (and strangely Hunters).
---
Wow classic is one of the biggest mmo releases in history, never seen this many people even original vanilla release.
---
&gt;moire
---
Wow, you are the first person outside my job to know this that I have seen anywhere.
---
People aren’t even level 40 yet and this is already coming up? Play the damn game we’ve waited so long for. Enjoy it. Have fun. People always want more and more til what? Til they just rerelease every expansion and we get caught in an infinite loop of rereleases? Just play the game
---
We only told them for months
---
I played Classic for now 10 hours, I have never played vanilla before and this is all I wanted : sociability. Now I can finally play a MMORPG where I HAVE to interact with other players, and where interacting with other players is not a chore, but actually something very fun.
---
Herod is a cesspool of scum and villainy in every zone I've been in so far.
---
I was still in a queue for 2-3 hours last night on kromcrush
---
I am not sure I understand correctly but you need to restart the client and log completely out of the game. As in back to the start of the Q
---
This is regular wow to me. Retail wow is babby wow.
---
Warlords was bad at launch because the servers kept crashing due to a handful of bugs and people at the same area.
---
 This is completely different as the servers arent laggy.
---
Dog, really didn't read any of that. As I said, I'm not going to waste energy on a troll. And since you cannot take a hint, I'm now blocking you.
---
Did it actually get to this point? Holy shit lmao!
---
The character screen has the realmname on top
---
That's a shit solution for a shit problem
---
Welcome to online gaming bro... lmao. 
---
Why do you think 99% of games have removed "text chat" features in 2019? 
---
Hint: it isn't because people don't enjoy Text Chat...
---
Just ask in global chat lol
---
people lined up for a quest last night. It was fucking money. i took a picture of it with my phone.
---
This. My life sucked so much more on vanilla compared to a paladin which I’m rolling now
---
How you install your addons after extracting? What paste do you put it?
---
In the character screen it clearly says which realm you are on. I was clever enough to missclick and wait over an hour of queue to get logged on the wrong server, GREAT moment.
---
You mean the low pops with 5k queue?
---
Skullflame doesn't have any queues.
---
I think it’s a bug.
---

Level 10 undead warlock looking for a group of chill and mature players to hangout with and keep each other company. Not looking for anything hardcore because I am taking my sweet time leveling. If there are any guilds out there that are just for making friends and memories then let me know I'd love to join.

Several Streamers were looking at queues on Faerlina after getting booted, and have since moved servers saying.. (Servers aren't big enough for all the streamers).
---
Wholesome mon. Grobb.
---
Hit up the profession trainers near your starting area
---
I kinda figured this was the case I had about 4400 people ahead of me last night after a few hours, was about to call it a night and then the number just plummeted and I got in right away. 
---
So I got to play for a couple hours which was nice
---
Everyone has different things but I think a lot of it can be wrapped up with this:
---
Over the years they gradually "smoothed" over everything. They made leveling faster, traveling quicker, every milestone easier and cheaper (mounts). They dumbed down "specs" and made respeccing instant and free. They made it so you can instantly pop into a group or raid without any social interaction. The whole game ended up feeling like a glorified and dumbed-down single-player experience.
---
If you keep making everything easier, keep "improving" everything through QoL changes, you're eventually left with a soulless experience that feels like it plays itself. This is a constant balance in game design, and I'm not arguing that QoL improvements are *never* good... but Blizzard is a prime example of taking them to the extreme to the point that it strips away most of the experience. Diablo 3 suffers from this as well.
---
Vanilla goes back to before all of that was the case (although to put things in perspective, Classic WoW was still *much* easier and smoothed out experience compared to every other MMO at the time).
---
But..it isn't? Dude 'dead server' was a legit thing in vanilla. Azshara hadn't cleared BWL when Naxx was out.
---
People avoided it like the plague, the cities were empty, there were no guilds doing anything outside of 5 mans.
---
It. Was. Dead.
---
In about a year
---
Its possible. I think Teamviewer ist the best example
---
Welcome to humanity. I like reading all the bullshit.
---
Didn't know it was a thing. Updated thread, I'll keep it going for a while nonetheless.
---
My buddy sold a few pieces of his armor to purchase his skills. Really brought back the classic vibes for me
---
I am using no addons. Been playing for about 9 hours now. My guild has no idea either, and non of them have this. Any ideas?
---
I couldn't begin to tell you how many thousands of stacks of water and food I gave out standing outside of the orgrimmar auction house in vanilla. It's a little shot of good feels while you're shitposting in /1.
---
this sounds like a swedish game tbh
---
Then show me a vid from beta, stress test or post launch with a constant 20tick energy regen.  Because you can't. And I'm not talking about 2-3 correct ticks in a row
---
i legit no lie got a 6 slot bag on like my 5th kill on a new toon

Mograine is better. It sounds like migraine, which is what all this queueing is giving me.
---
I'm 9..... Gnome Warrior.
---
What happens to players with duplicate names in the event of server merger?
---
Eh, nothing a few free realm transfers and merges can't fix
---
I agree. I think it will be okay. I just don't get the people crying about them not opening more servers.
---
Should note there are 5 more "Low" servers below Kurinnaxx.
---
You can turn down settings all the way to shitsville if you'd like. That'll help. Honestly, your computer will probably run wow just fine.
---
For the timings did you use displayed time or the actual time?
---
Only in the tauren areas my dude. You'll have to go back.  
---
I can't remember what level, but I wanna say around 12 or so -- you'll get a teleport spell that will let you teleport to an area called Moonglade where there will be a trainer you can get to quickly from then on out.
---
Id rather play for 2 months hope for a transfer or pay for one if needed.
---
He mentioned last night because of the site issue, his goal now is to only beat his previous time of getting to 60.
---
I'll keep it in mind for future horde alts, thanks.
---
normally the queues should last from 200-500 mins either. guess there's nothing normal about classic launch
---
That’s why I’d equip it on my own twink. Until I can replace it
---
lol ok buddy sure thing
---
Tukui
---
Just give people free transfers.  They should have announced it ahead of time what the policy would be so people could plan ahead of time.  The infrastructure is not the expensive part of all this.
---
eating up queue spots nice
---
All the overnight streamers are already in the 20s. Def gonna be a few 60s at week's end.
---
Que on every server about 10-20k which translates to about 5-9hours. Good luck!
---
Troll troll, troll troll. Troll troll, troll troll. Trooolll!! Trooolll!!!
---
Or just some WoW tokens.. I've had only 2 accounts and have my sub running till over 2022 (thats 2x 3years+)
---
Not really. I mean, you just kill stuff, follow directions, and level up. That’s the short of it, but if you need more to do there’s always extra. If you have questions there are plenty of sources online to find an answer. I wouldn’t just not play because I’ve never played an MMO before. If you don’t like it then just unsub and all you’ve lost is $15.
---
Queue god is too afraid to touch.Might start queue again by mistake.Then no more queue god :(

back up

Even low pop servers have queues dude.

We thank you!

Oh yes, 6 hour queues is the true nostalgia!
---
I guarantee you that the 18k players currently queuing Herod aren't all in pre-made guilds. 
---
There's an irrational fear of missing out.
---
I am also looking for a working version of Healbot!
---
Correct, I even tried a clicker to stay active whilst I had to go out for a couple hours. I cam back to a kicked state. 14k players waiting to re queue, looks like I'm not playing tonight.
---
Yo to the systems team at Blizz 
---
When you made early character creation and previously the stress test, what were you thinking when you decided to stick to your guns and have a minimal amount of servers in comparions to the known load. That's not even accounting for predicted load. 
---
It's almost as if the metrics you obtained from character reservation and load testing meant nothing. 
---
This is really shoddy work
---
Everyone in line saw him enter the room and literally camp himself on top of the spawn point. He had like 12 people bitching at him at the same time and ignored everyone. After he got the kill he called us all fragile snowflakes and ran out. What a sad existence he must live.
---
Not everyone can be an adult, that's okay, if you chose to be salty about something that was 100% clear from the beginning, be salty. :)
---
&gt; No LFG tools
---
Theres automatic group making through the meeting stones and innkeepers.
---
Dunno where you play but on Firemaw its 22000 in queue atm.
---
I'm EU. Guild is on a med pop. I've been in queue for an hour and a half since I got in from work. I still have 100 mins projected to go
---
This is one of my favorite parts already!

Not interested in a PvE server, but thank you.

Wow that was awesome! I had an awesome experience too today in Dun Morough. There were over a dozen people trying to get the same quest item and instead of everyone trying to snatch the item, people formed an orderly line and everyone waited their turn. It was so cool!
---
Messages like this make it pretty clear logon uses a separate set of servers https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/login-servers-full/193536
---
I felt the same. But to be fare, my server is so crowded that I ended up getting saved from dying because random players helped me out
---
Yes they are the best.
---
Fairbanks at 6am PT also had no queue, same as Blowme. Whitemane had a few hundred in queue. Logged into Rattlegore, and Northshire was almost empty. Curious how it goes today, next week, etc.
---
You are simply not informed. There is massive layering implemented already, I have no problem with that. This problem is blizzard not releasing enough servers. And also that layers CRASH and people disconnect. After you disconnect you get LAST IN A 20 000 queue. If only you could rely on staying in the server after you waited for 4 hours already, but you can't. Now get the fuck out you obviously know nothing. This is blizz fault 100%.
---
Sounds like you'd have more fun with warrior! You don't want to pick a class you know you wont enjoy as much dince you'll be levelling forever either way! :-)
---
G.o.a.t.ana
---
just make a character and play it to lvl 30ish you'll really see if you love it... it's not like there's a 1 character limit
---
I thought Classic also has sharding?
---
It could also be that there's hundreds of players fighting everything. How many times have you accidentally pulled more than 1 mob? It's damn near impossible to fuck up right now due to how many people are out assisting
---
Plus there have been some random crashes this morning.
---
Yea bro 50% your going to get dc’d and dropped to the back of the que. not even joking wish I was
---
This guy thinks Mages slowly dwindle peoples HP away,
---
Is somebody gonna tell him or...?
---
Bags.... bags sir and then once you have done that... more bags 😈
---
What I did was learn fishing and just fish every 10-15 min until you could get home. Just be courteous you're not doing this for 4 or 5 hours. Other people wanna play while you're out IRL grinding.
---
Algos gon algo. The real test will be the Q3 ER when we get some solid numbers.
---
You know like to transfer the character ya to be able to login to the server thru the backend then “transfer” and login to the destination server . Although you personally are not in the game your character goes thru those steps while you are in the store xferrinf them.
---
So add the 50000 char xfers into the queue as well that will help
---
/r/technicallythetruth
---
So whenever I want to play I'm going to have to wait two hours.... Is this sarcasm? aha that's ridiculous
---
Ended up on Kromcrush also. Gonna stay here since I'd rather play than worry about server pops months from now. Worst case i'll jump servers when paid xfers are live 😑
---
As in, from the viewpoint of server infrastructure it’s much easier to addon and mirror the existing servers than it is to consolidate multiple servers into one
---
I've been in queue again for 2 hours and it went from 10,000 to 6,000... so its still 2,000 an hour for me. Huh.
---
I would go one further and have it so if u sub to classic you cannot post on retail and vice versa.
---
Solves all the bs trolling at the same time.
---
I can't speak for all of them but Journey is 100% on his own.
---
I’m gonna have to start doing this from my phone I guess
---
There were multiple servers without queues last night, at least in the US.
---
I've heard that this and things like moonlight actually violate the ToS if you aren't on the same network. I know it 100% does if you play on like a cloud computer based gaming service
---
They have been telling people to prepare for long queues for a while now.
---
This was expected. It will clam down in a week
---
I grinded spiders til 3 then bats then at 4 to brill
---
In a way I understand them. Whats the point of playing when you know you gonna go X than go Y than farm Z etc. You know what to grind and other shit, vanila was cool because no one knew anything and everything was new. Ive never played vanila and i like it so far.
---
You should look at the numbers of Runescape 3 (EOC) Vs. OSRS. [OSRS usually pulls around 3-4x the amount of players as Runescape 3.](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/?display=avg&amp;interval=qtr_yr&amp;total=1)
---
I’m sure they are on the cloud by now.
---
This is racist...
---
I was thinking maybe 1-2 months, but I'd like to see what happens in regards to the queue times, &amp; Blizzard adding/removing servers
---
So I got in finally. Had to work. Forgot about game. Got DCD now back on queue hahaha. Hopefully this time I will be logged in around when I get home. I believe it's like 10 minutes afk at character select is all it takes to dc
---
Except you get DC'ed randomly and then don't get prioritized to log back in.
---
It’s always nice seeing local beer on Reddit. Green Bench is damn amazing (and the best brewery in St Pete imo)

6% isn't exactly super noteworthy.
---
Just bragging rights, they didn't have achievements back then.
---
Probably the only time as well lol. *laughs in money*
---
The imp isn't allowed to flag the master for PvP.
---
Buffing you would flag the other player for PvP.
---
you can either unflag in starting zones /pvp, or have your friend flag and it will work normally.
---
aint shazzrah high queue?
---
then at the very least, skinning makes a lot of sense. You will be able to skin all dead animals while leveling (boars, bears, etc). You can vendor these skins for additional money, and you can eventually skin the appropriate animals for leatherworking mats for crafting gear for yourself.
---
The second profession can be another gathering profession like herbalism or mining. This is useful for collecting materials to level another profession later, or selling the stuff on the auction house for additional money. 
---
Having skinning + herbalism/mining would be a good money maker early on and can help secure your mount by level 40.
---
Thing is I'm with a clan so I want to join fairbanks
---
Honestly I agree with them. In a week wait times will be minimal I'm sure.
---
Well yes, but that wouldn't explain that the characters were created automatically? Maybe I just don't remember creating new ones, but I think that is unlikely.
---
What doyou use to have wifi in your car on your laptop ?
---
What would your solution have been?
---
You just weren't very clear what your intentions were with the post, it could be taken that you wanted people to go there and argue.  "Let's take care of ourselves" could mean game in moderation, or more mafia style go take care of our own.
---
You sound like a guy who knows little to nothing about server administration.
---
\&gt;:@
---
Two weeks ago, there were 13 US/Oceanic servers total. Now there are 16 PvP servers alone in that region. I agree that they underestimated interest. But at least they're adding servers.
---
Yeah, you can find the quest areas in retail.
---
I know many other people who want Cata, Mop, and WoD servers. Which is weird to say in of itself.
---
I don't think doing Classic w/ expansions again is a good idea. It's my opinion though, so I understand others have differing opinions. I have a friend who really really wants BC servers, but nothing past it. It just strikes me as meh.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Por que(s)? Or do you mean ‘por queue(s)?’
---
Multiple of them scattered around Silverpine. Since nameplates have a low distance it can be hard not to run into them sometimes.
---
You just keep delivering. Preciate it!
---
I queued into whitemane at 1030am PDT, and I just got in
---
I'm pretty sure Blameux straight up crashed a little after midnight server time. It came back up pretty quickly, but all the chat was people signing on and going "Did anyone else get booted?"
---
Also, with 8,770 in front of you your queue time was NOT 10 min. Just sayin.
---
I didn't mean to imply that everyone there was, just that there would be a disproportionate amount of late-comers who jumped in after seeing streamers play.
---
tbh i had more fun clearing out icc25hc and ulduar... and even realm first  Argus The Unmaker felt amazing.  sure murlocs are nice and shit, but i had a blast in a lot of moments in retail.  
---
im in qeue btw 22.000 \^

Why not use actual game data instead of relying on reports. Whoever on this list makes sixty first probably will not be the actual first one.

---
Umm, I mean you're kinda right. But those servers don't just exist in the cloud. They're massive physical server farms that physically house those servers, and they're subject to the same issues all hardware is.
---
I'll admit, I wasn't expecting queues to this scale.  An hour or two maybe, not 7.
---
All the streamers + 10
---
but you can get into the bank though where you can attack people
---
Let's see what the votes say...
---
It's not the actual server hardware infrastructure that is limiting the amount of people that can log into a realm. With layering a realm could accommodate far more people than are currently let through the queue. The limit is artificial so as to not over-inflate the population of any one realm; because layering will eventually be removed and then more stringent caps will have to be enforced. Blizzard has said as much. These transfers will aid in what the enforced queues themselves are trying to achieve. Spreading out the playerbase.
---
A nice trick is purchasing a code from another site and redeeming. I gifted my bud a sub last night ran into this que and opted for the code.
---
Ohhh awesome. I'm on Herod though so I'll most likely have a queue, but that's still a bit reassuring.
---
you can get into the bank
---
position in queue: 4671

estimated time: 107 min

\ you dropped this

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

You'll get whaet's comin' ta ye laddie
---
$300 for what? I would expect to receive about 30 months of game time for that price.
---
Or are you saying pay $300 one time fee for access to Classic?
---
So today in the morning around 8;45 AM CEST I went to login into Classic and had to wait around 30 minutes to login into Shazzrah EU.
---
I played all afternoon long untill around 6 PM CEST. You might've heard, thousands of people got mass dc'd for no reason including me. I've been in que since which started at around 19k. Now 3 hours later I am sitting at around 6400. You do the math.
---
You are severely overestimating your luck.
---
Depends on how long they leave layering in :(
---
Also stay away from the 10 items or less lane since that's normally where they put the slow cashiers who can't keep up a decent pace so 5 people with 40 items between them will often as long or longer of a wait than 5 people with 80 items between them in a normal lane.
---
Probably are least five
---
In all honesty.. I havent a clue on the PVE servers, playing on a queueless PVE realm myself. Oh wait, the queues came there too. So theres time to post, even when there aint anything worth saying. My apologies for the empty comment.
---
Holy shit. It's been, what, 13 years? 
---
This is Ghostface by the way. I'm gonna have to disappoint and admit that I'm not playing. I just googled the old guild to see if the forums were still up, since I imagined the ol' gang might be arranging a WoW Classic revisit :D The hype has got me nostalgic, but I'm thinking of skipping out. Work and life got the better of me. 
---
I can ask Cloy if he is playing though. We're still friends IRL.
---
streamer bad streamer chair bad
---
If they release new servers and transfer people they can still remove layering. I am preparing myself for layering in phase 2 though. 
---
The numbers are pretty insane. For example on ZT right now, the queue is 7000. I highly doubt Blizzard will be quick to add another RP-PvP realm when they were so hesitant with the first one. So for my server choice at least I am 100% prepared for layering for a long time.
---
EU or US? :)
---
a lot of people have been saying this for a lot of years, but activi$ion will gladly take your money for the sense of pride and accomplishment people get off roflstomping kids with 20 accounts
---
Just so excited too play overlooked such a simple thing lol happy questing :)
---
This is embarrassing, thousands of gamers who thought the wow classic launch (or any mmo launch) would go seamlessly and honestly expected to be able to play uninterrupted on day one.
---
Y'all are hilarious. The rest of us are waiting for you on Earth once you get your head out of the clouds 😊
---
hehe Son of Arugal deaths.....classic
---
What were the reasons for taking out the weather effect?
---
Hey you didn't even photoshop a low level helmet on the bear, how was it not considered for being "low effort meme"?
---
It was , atleast I saw 1.1 mil.
---
No company is going to invest the time and money needed to provide the additional architecture that will be needed for the rush on and around launch day.
---
It's not a coincidence that every major MMO launch is a mess. They know its going to happen. They'll throw out a "we're sorry."
---
The gaming community has such a ridiculously short attention  span, why waste tens of thousands of dollars when they can just not and wait 2 days for everyone to forgive and forget?
---
I'm in the Tampa area... I'm going to have to keep an eye out for some of your stuff!
---
It has been stated that the classic servers are much larger, but even at *much larger* that could still be less than 10K
---
Friendly reminder that in classic, the capacity of each server is MASSIVE compared to Vanilla. A medium pop server is MUCH larger than a full server in Vanilla.
---
So what? If they think they can get more subs by releasing cars they’ll do it. Personally I think they’ll end retail soon and keep it on a continuously flowing schedule of restarting with classic servers every 5-10 years.
---
I was literally thinking of doing this EXACT thing today. I chose wrong.. if it’s a big que again I’m going to give it a shot.
---
Yeah, bottom should be 2020, ain't no way the Grand Marshal factory guilds will be pumping out this kinda gear in current year.
---
I’d argue that I am special 😉
---
Oh. Yeah that's not very useful for me then, oh well. Snipping tool it is.
---
Phase 2 it’s gonna be a cluster
---
Tbh with the lack of servers and the insane ques it should be playable at the same time. That way people can at least play retail while they wait on ques
---
If you're already going to spend the money on a 2 year sub, why not have the option to spend it now? This separates the wheat from the chaff.
---
* You are marked AFK automatically after 5 minutes without any interaction.
---
* You'll be logged off and sent to the character selection screen if you are AFK for 30 minutes.
---
* You'll be disconnected from the server if you remain at the character selection screen for 30 minutes.
---
What does it look like right now?
---
I'm a dwarf atm
---
I will roll a character on Old Blanchy tonight I think.  Better than waiting for 20,000 queue.  But yea I dont want to level up and end up on a dead server like happened to me in original wow :(
---
Quicker than I could read this. I would be ok if this was F2P but you're charging me to be 11k in queue.
---
Class Action time anyone ?
---
Is that Bhodizafa???
---
Bromance
---
It still isn’t out for most people. They’re still playing the queue simulation game.
---
Self inflicted wounds. Other servers are open to play on immediately
---
If you get DC'd and log back in after you get put into a faster Que than normally just logging in. I logged in and had a bug to i risked it and logged out and back into the world and was instantly placed back into the game.
---
I'm TeamViewed into my home PC watching the queue drop slowly. Maybe I will actually get to play tonight!
---
you can still get in the bank too
---
so thats why meds have queue
---
This doesn't have the correct information for some things, wowhead can suck my nuts
---
classicdb.ch is where it's at
---
Anywhere that details how to do that? I want to be able to do that as well. I’ve been waiting since 11:45am. It’s 3:11 and I just finally got under 1000 in queue.
---
Because say you bring on 3 new servers and people from 2 of the heavy servers flock to one of those servers. That now creates a God awful queue on that one new server. In 2 weeks time a bunch of people give up on classic because it's not as easy as retail and now you have 1 heavy, 3 low, and 1 medium. What did you accomplish? They'll most likely have to merge the low population servers like was done in the past.
---
"There's no way they are going to do this to me." 
---
What a self-entitled twat lmao.
---
thats a terrible idea and essentialy a threat that will destroy the internet as we know it. look up the term net neutrality. fast pass would be an affront to every old/original classic player who despises todays micro-transaction driven gaming industry that destroyed the gaming universes that we once loved
---
yes, and now is the time to do it.  
---
Brand new servers, no one is capped yet, anything is possible, zones are crowded, people are helping each other out with elites, and it feels nothing like retail wow
---
Those are rookie numbers! 10 hours here. And counting.
---
Same for me, Im waiting since 7hours.
---
Why does Germany only has 2 PvP Servers jesus
---
Are you retarded or something?
---
Kromcrush represent. I feel like we have an advantage against queues since the name is so obviously bad.
---
DAE RETAIL BAD, ONLY CLASSIC GUD LUL
---
Stop spammimg this garbage its not funny
---
There are no words for bootlickers that think it's unreasonable to criticize Blizzard for not coming up with a more innovative solution or detailing a helpful plan to the public for how to handle this.
---
You can't move to new servers, they just get queues too. Every new server that pops up increases the possibility down the road that you may get left on a ghost world.
---
Man this is so wholesome, I can only start playing tomorrow so this just got even more hyped!
---
Spent 3ish hours in queue for whitemane, said screw it and played on one of the new servers just to play a little bit before bed.
---
I could not stop gushing to my girlfriend about how much nostalgia was hitting me. Got into a group with 4 random people and played thru the Fargo deep mines quests until I needed to get to bed for work. 
---
Tag battles, waiting for everyone to get their 12 bandanas... Feels like I'm home dude.
---
Seriously, if you saw that long queue at the start, why didn't you switch servers? There are servers without queues that long. Just to get playing, at least. You don't have to stay.
---
Jokes on you that less than a minute is going to shoot way back up over an hour!
---
Lol, so we're speculating stuff to feel good about attacking someone?
---
Never change, Reddit.
---
Gw2 Heart of Thorns and path of fire. Though its more instanced than WoW I had no queues on both of those launches. The instanced maps probably prevented this.
---
Could you point me to the source? Not trying to “getcha” just want to read the context in which they claimed this, considering that artificially raising the pop caps to private server levels would be incredibly controversial.
---
Everything from spawn rates to loot drops would need to be adjusted accordingly.
---
Firstly because it's hard to convice your level 10+ friends who have invested time to switch server, and when you actually do switch server it fills up to the same capacity as the last one in like 4-5 hours and then you have to make the same choice again, stay and endure the queue but keeo your progress or skip queue and start from scratch. Both choices suck and usually splits the group into 2
---
I just posted it once though
---
Friend complains that he will have to wait a week before playing because of queues while I just log on to Hydraxian waterlords after reset without any queue.
---
How Barrens chat of you
---
There are addons. It's level 27.
---
Then it's probably best not to bother with classic.
---
No that's not at all what they are saying. They are saying they wanted to be safe and not add too many servers. They clearly knew it would be big so they wanted to make sure they were ready for actual numbers.
---
Found the lone wolf
---
&gt; which meant Blizzard knew...and honestly they didn't care
---
Exactly, it doesn't matter. We'll all be playing happily in a couple days. 
---
&gt; they can keep pretending that retail isn't currently a garbage product and have to admit just how poorly they screwed up their game over the past 15 years.
---
Now you're just being childish xD
---
FOMI
---
If only they had warned us about these queues, right guys?
---
I did that through SFK back in Vanilla.  I had never played an open world mmo before and had come from diablo 1 and 2 so i just assumes the camera angle was fixed lol.
---
omg so true
---
There are more than twice as many PvP servers as PvE servers, so even if its just a PvP problem, it's still a problem affecting the majority of servers.
---
Will I need to load it up for a first time launch before adding the addon or will it work perfectly after its instillation without and initial boot? Also really sounds quite fun, think next payday hopefully the ques have dropped down a bit and I can really settle in and enjoy it for what it has to offer. Ill check out some builds and see what I can do.
---
You have been super helpful, thank you. 
---
If you have any other tips you think could be useful 100% would appreciate them other than that I think im pretty much sold. :)
---
I think that mass DC was a little different, something happened with the server there. Normally, you can jump out and back in if you do it quickly.
---
Man that is rough! I assume your best bet is to wait it out for a few days and hope the queues die down?
---
I already have a lvl 10 and All my friends are playing on that server ?
---
All 4 of the movies are definitely worth watching.
---
Maybe he's talking about raid roles?
---
Yes sir developer
---
all the existing servers will be high. The problem is stubborn people refuse to leave the ridiculously full servers to join the low ones. Give it a few more week, I’m on kirtonos and already lvl 20 with 0 wait. They’ll become impatient and slowly make way to the lower servers
---
Ah, the second sentence explains the first.
---
Are pools available in this version? I used to fish oily blackmouth in silverpine forest at skill 150 on prv servers xD but here couldn't find any
---
I wouldn’t be so presumptuous. You have no way of knowing you were first, especially as Night Elves. A human player could’ve gotten there first, had a dance party, left before you even got there.
---
My Acer 2-1(tablet) handles fucking WoW
---
I got on Ashbringer when it was low and then 30 minutes later people were saying there was already a 3k queue.
---
Hope you won't get disconnected in the next 30 minutes and get to enjoy the game.
---
Tldr: Asmon is the most successful WoW streamer in the game’s history (monetarily) so all streamers not directly involved with Asmon spend all day and night shitting on him or of jealousy. 
---
That jealousy is also shared by all of the hardcore crowd, who resent Asmon’s fans for giving him free stuff. 
---
That’s all it is really, petty jealousy.
---
Do you have gathering or production profs?
---
I’ve managed to afford everything by vendoring the stuff I make with smithing just from what I’ve mined while questing
---
I really dont care. i want to be able to Play this game with my 10+ friends. They have to wake Up every 30 min in the night to stay in game to avoid the queue. Im not able to do that. I have a girlfriend and University
---
Realm population cap != population of a specific zone where a ton of people are all logging in at once. Removing layers doesn't reduce/change the realm population cap.
---
The only RP I ever saw on Emerald Dream was people messing around at that inn next to the SW Mage Tower.
---
I mean if it looks reputable. Sorry I haven't done enough research outside of my usual spots.
---
Even the medium pvp servers have a huge que now
---
Yup. I remember just killing turtles off the coast of Hinterlands for several hours. Burnt out from questing but not burnt out from the sheer joy of murder, meat, clams, pearls, and vendor trash.
---
Seriously, why did they take these out?
---
First off, welcome to what a lot of people are feeling. This is a good form of excitement of joining the unknown. No matter what others may say, your experience will be a unique one. So let's start:
---
Everything is new, you are not alone, the game will teach you well enough. Current retail WoW explains every class similarly , where as WoW Classic every class is unique except for the extreme generalizations you can make about some (Warlock is a caster and so is shadow priest and mage) This is fantasy. You choose your own path and will learn along the way and from leveling. (Like choosing a class)
---
Group often and find people you connect with. WoW Classic demands that you step outside that box and talk with people. The world is dangerous (pulling 3 mobs can and will kill you very often) We are a community and you can see that clearly from the current posts here. If you are worried about end-game content, join a guild. No question is stupid but you may get silly responses. 
---
The satisfaction you may feel should not be compared to others. Everything in the game is experienced the same way whether you play a few hours or a few days (in-game). Put the time you want into it. Feel free to share your success with other people though. Your first green weapon for instance.
---
For an enjoyable experience make sure you learn to key bind. (Macros come after) Simple things like pressing Shift-1 to buff is better then clicking your bar. Eventually, just like other games, a well keybound bar will mean that you don't need to look at it and can focus more on the game itself.  (Interface -&gt; Action Bars allows for more bars to add abilities to it then use Key Binding tab to make key binds)
---
Specifically for Warlocks. If you know what a warlock is you can probably guess what professions to take. They wear cloth so Tailoring is always a plus. They cast spells so Enchanting things makes sense.  But Alchemy and Herbalism are great too for potion making.  (Get secondary professions like First aid, fishing, and cooking)
---
The best way to start the game.. it's too subjective. Warlocks summon pets, you must learn to control your pet but they have simple mechanics like (attack, stop attacking, passively follow). The game will teach you how to use it. Voidwalker is a beast for leveling but explore the different kinds. You'll only have an imp to start but can acquire a few more (no spoilers). Warlocks also have a mount quest. It's crazy but well worth it.
---
Most every time you leveling up, visit your "warlock" trainer which can be found in the starting areas and major cities. Buy useful new spells when leveling (don't just buy all the spells, read them and find what is useful for how you are leveling like if they do more damage. Money is scarce early. Don't waste it on something you find yourself not using.
---
There is a lot of aspects to your question. But hopefully you look at this and get a good feeling of how to start and what to expect from both your class and the game. Anything more specific I can try to answer as well so feel free to ask. I've played Warlock, Druid and Rogues most of the time in WoW. Serious love for them all. Hopefully you'll have the same love. Cheers.
---
Blizz will consolidate dead servers after the die off if they need to, why is this so hard to understand
---
Same here, doing it when I get home. Even changing my names, I'll just log on every now and then to the other and have my friends carry me when they can
---
I like it alot. Plenty of nice people to group with
---
merging realms is "catastrophic"?... really?
---
How do they Sound shitty to you ?
---
Fkin troll
---
were u daggers?
---
Dude, nice :D
---
I rolled to Flamelash @ release.. Got my mage to lvl 12 before going to work and server was still low pop.
---
Now when i came back its medium with 9k queues :D
---
I've rerolled from 3 servers and still get the same issue, big queues, yea seems silly people waiting in queue of 15k+ but all servers are becoming like that in a matter of hours
---
&gt;You think you do, but you don't
---
Two, so far. It was great meeting them. I’m hoping to meet some more people and maybe join a guild down the line.
---
Why use puush instead of imgur, that's what I use.
---
It's working exactly as they planned.  If they don't have any queues and just layer endlessly then you end up with 150K people playing on Whitemane and you will literally never be able to get rid of it.  So they have to use the data they have available to them to say "based on the history of every launch we've ever seen, we can estimate that if a server is at X capacity, then 4 months down the road the peak population will be at just about peak levels."
---
They definitely underestimated the number of initial servers they'd need but layering itself seemed to work like a charm as someone who got into the game at launch.
---
Moving one person is simple. The problem is that when the servers were first announced, groups of friends, whole guilds, etc had to organize and choose which server to be on.  It’s a big pain in the ass to try to move 100 people to another server together when everyone is already playing on one, albeit with queues.
---
My bro and I made our mains on Stonespine now. Great server :) there are so many people, it's not a medium server anymore either. Even low pop servers seem super full (joined when it was still low). With queue time rather low, I think It was the right choice.
---
Swehennas is the place 2 be boiz!
---
We had our 30 minutes of Anal \[Item\] last night too. Classic bits in Classic.
---
Wha-
---
That's a good question, I have no idea :( . I only got to level 8 last night in Dun Morough and only fished for maybe 10 mins.
---
Oh this is when Sargeras thrust his sword into the planet and we got GLORIOUS azerite throo da planet’s open woons!
---
last night we got stock like that on herod, queue quit moving.
---
Then suddenly all 3 of us got disconnected, and some of us immediately got in, the other two within 15 minutes.
---
This makes no sense at all.... You said no sharding and got what you asked for.
---
I'm sure he'll survive.
---
\&gt; switch to a low pop server to circumvent huge queues, but afraid to end up on a dead server
---
\&gt; has 11k queue
---
As a warrior, thank you to every priest who casts PW:Fortitude on me randomly
---
It's saying 475 in 20 minutes now and it feels accurate. More accurate than when it said 29 minutes a few hours ago anyway..
---
Ok I will look at this thanks
---
&gt; Newman: What is the actual **queue cap?**
---
&gt; Hazzikostas: **It's a very high number.** I don't actually remember off the top of my head. I want to say it's something like 30,000. The longest queues I've ever seen in the live game at something like the worst of Warlords launch were something like seven or eight thousand.
---
&gt; Newman: How many people are on servers now, as compared to a typical high-population realm on the original World of Warcraft launch day?
---
&gt; Hazzikostas: Much more. That's why we have this sense of alarm around Herod and Shazzrah. **I think server capacity was something like 3,000 concurrent logins by late Classic.** That number's gone up steadily over time as our hardware capacity's improved and as the world [of Azeroth] has gotten larger.
---
&gt; So yes, when you're talking about five digit numbers waiting in line to enter the world, that's enough to fill a couple servers servers, which is why we're bringing servers online and encouraging folks to move.
---
&gt; Newman: How big is a single layer? What's the end target you're shooting for, for each server?
---
&gt; Hazzikostas: **Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.**
---
&gt; I think you can view it as effectively, just us running multiple classic launch servers, 2006-era, in parallel, with **the intent of collapsing them down into a single one over the course of a few weeks.**
---
Better queues now than dozens of dead servers later. Blizzard can't win. Queues and people are pissed. Dead realms with dead economies later people are pissed. 
---
Does waiting suck? Hell yeah. But I'd rather wait now than have to realm transfer later.
---
he is chaff to be swallowed by the insatiable maw of the horde.
---
Get sharex.  Objectively better.
---
if it happens i hope they will add free migration to other servers like it was in Vanilla
---
If there was a queue for Old Blanchy yesterday I must have missed it.
---
Yeah that’s the plan.  It’s just so frustrating to have to deal with this after we thought we were doing the right thing and moving before launch.
---
"sharding is necessary it will solve the problem!" they said...
---
And people are selling those 6 slot bags for 5g in auction house when you can buy them for 40silver off NPC's
---
last time i checked EU servers queue list there were over 270k people waiting in the queues to get into all the servers.
---
Surely this has to be hurting the game more than having some dead but mergable servers in the future
---
Even at noon mountain there were queues already
---
So you prove my point. Why would they spend money when they can wait for you to not do anything about it? You'll grumble on reddit but at the end of the month they get the $15
---
That's true, but waiting behind 5000 people is considerably different from waiting behind 20,000 people like what I've been experiencing
---
I took your comment as a snarky way of insinuating that I was talking out of my ass. So I provided you with a source. Feel free to clarify what you meant.
---
Im actually level 12.
---
No, I will not change.
---
All my guild with 10 year friends with 35 people are in Herod, we already have lvl 20 in the guild.
---
Its not easy to change realm since its a social game and Classic doesn't work like retail where you can solo the end game.
---
So yeah, just add more layers and pump the capacity for Christ's sake!
---
You guys really can't let anything go, he pretty much had an admission of acceptance considering he revealed classic wow in 2017.
---
You must be imagining things, there’s no way Blizzard would so dramatically underestimate how many people would want to play classic!
---
For sure. If classic ends up to be more than just hype and maintains a solid and loyal base of players (as it seems it will), other mmorpg will for sure adapt.
---
The server sizes are artificially low in order to incentivize people to spread out across the servers. They could very easily allow the servers to have more layers ("temporary servers") and allow more people.
---
They don't do that though, because layering will be going away before phase 2. It's not only beneficial, but absolutely necessary, for everyone to spread out as much as possible.
---
Except in difficulty
---
Alot of your abilities require totems to be cast. The panel on he right-hand-side list the req. level and explain how to start the quest chains for those totems as well as key locations for those chains.
---
So is it just the norm that tens of thousands of people who took time off of work or out of their daily lives to set aside a few hours for a game launch are just fucked? That's just accepted now? Lol ok.
---
Bloodsail got worse as the night went on last night.  mu wife had to wait an hour and a half to get in and one of my guildies had to wait a little over 2 hours after he got back fron the store.  we went from low pop to medium from 6pm to 8pm.
---
Have you considered this?  
---
1. A lot of people chose 1 of two servers that first got announced.
---
2. Then Blizz told every one "Hey, here are some new servers. The one you chose are over populated!"
---
3. You, including your let's say 15 friends and your guild, let's say 300 people listen to blizzard and you go to one of the new one
---
4. Then again right before launch, blizz again tell you to swap. People now can't organize that many people to move, including your friends (cus they wanna stay in the guild).
---
5. So now you either Swap, play alone and HOPE for server transfer (which prob will only be from high to medium/low) or you stay.
---
It's prob more you do not have that many to play with, or you and your friends are fine with swapping.   
---
PS: Also people might not get their name on a new server, and then the nostalgia goes away. So they stay cus on the current server they have their name.  
---
PS2: Blizz fcked up, even new servers are getting queues withing a few hours..
---
Join a low population one that just opened... you will be able to play.
---
Even Medium have 2-3hours queue time (and more)
---
I joined the queue, went to the beach, went to a restaurant with friends, got home and there were still 5k people ahead of me in queue
---
Wash yer back!
---
gz all ur wow luck has been used up already
---
Not for the pickaxe shown here. Only one person can loot at a time and it despawns afterwards.
---
Hey! That's my childhood memories. Give them back theif!
---
What a kick ass line of work.
---
Great fucking job this is what we all need 👌🏻
---
I accidentally hit escape with less than 100/&lt;1m from an 8k/30m queue. Fortunately, when I went back into the (same) queue I got my place back. Dodged a bullet there.
---
Only 14k RN.. I to get a lot worse when the weebs r out od school
---
There was a blue post last week that said “medium” now is larger than “full” was back in the day. 
---
I wouldn’t be scared of a medium pop server. In my opinion I would rather risk it than sit in a 20k queue.
---
Just some very minor UI differences that I've noticed so far. Like settings and stuff due to the more modern client, but play-wise, it's very similar. I got a rude awakening and reminder that my Level 5 rogue couldn't just walk through and slaughter a bunch of level 7 mobs. It was a battle just to beat one before dying.
---
Yesterday morning I resubbed and checked out the servers, and at that point every single non-rp server was full. I checked a bit later and noticed a single new server had opened up and was at medium. Pretty cool, I thought, and we all decided to roll on that server to avoid the queues as much as possible.    
---
Skip forward to today, and I have been sitting in queue for 8 hours.    
---
Since you seem to have things figured out, can you point out exactly where in this process I could have done something differently to be able to play right now?
---
Mine was 7 hours last night on fairbanks(US) with 12k in queue...
---
Had a couple friends already logged in playing so I didn't want to switch.  Though the dwarf starting area wasn't too crowded when I finally logged in at midnight!
---
Why would you think they would drop tons of money on extra servers and the like, when anyone with common sense / has played any other mmo at launch knows that the populations will die off in the next week? 
---
You know what would suck even more than queues? Releasing a bunch of servers and having them all low pop after 3 weeks when the hype dies down.  Then having to deal with the logistics of server transfers/merges, people losing their reserved name/etc.
---
Wait for you turn of 11k queue tomorrow
---
Low pop is relative right now. All the servers have a lot of players on them. Frankly, if there was a new, low pop server for myself, and the wife, I'd move over in a heartbeat. Only have a few hours of play on the other one. No worries about losing that little bit of progress.
---
They can. Its called switch your server ya fucking dodo
---
See you on the battlefield ;)
---
I been fishing a lot and never got it the past 10 years. Congratz.
---
Classic WoW VR? Hell yes!
---
Yep about the same here. I log in then go to work, raised a child from birth to putting them through college, and saved the rain forest. Finally when I’ve solved all the worlds problems I’m ready to finally select my character!
---
Yup! I regularly play Sea of Thieves, No Mans Sky, and others with no issues.
---
They aren’t selling them. They’re offering them. They won’t sell.
---
Lol did you just take a screenshot of my computer  towards 00h30 Atlantic Americas Time, while I was snoozing with 1 eye open seeing the trickling of people finally getting into the server?
---
4 people saying it, must be true
---
You’d think after 15 fucking years that Blizzard would prepare for this shit.
---
So their assumption was to abandon potential customers and revenue.  That seems absurd.
---
A lot of people picked a server with a guild or group of friends.  We chose servers based on what was recommended prior to launch.  Moving to a server they made after launch isn't an option 
---
The idiots at blizzard should have offered more servers prior to launch.
---
Do you have a stick button somewhere?
---
Man everybody here is super wholesome. Not gonna lie. I dig it.
---
You're assuming the devs didn't think of this themselves and decided against it. 
---
Or they thought of it and management decided against it.
---
Or they thought of it and it wouldn't work with how existing server infrastructure is built.
---
NA - Kromacrush - Horde - Healer Priest

LF DUNGEON CLEAVE GROUP TO HEAL
---
Can play 14+ hrs for the next 2 weeks PST
---
I am not long or short any positions in Activision/Blizzard, nor do I plan to be in the near future. I definitely think it would be an easy boost for their cash flow.
---
Would this really affect anything?
---
Yeah it's kinda bonkers. Like they even released more servers to help alleviate the stress but it did nothing lol. Youd think after releasing fucking 9000 expansions with EVERY ONE OF THEM being a total tragedy on launch day they'd have this shit figured out lol.
---
It's not just Herod.  We knew Herod was an issue so they offered new servers and told players to roll there.
---
Now these new servers have an ungodly wait time.
---
You on right now? Any chance you could tell me what the Blameaux queue is?
---
They are only 5s for 6 slot at trade vendor
---
I have arranged my keybinds for targeting friendlies/buffs just to make it easy to buff people as we pass by
---
True but lots and lots and lots of people have never played vanilla wow.
---
Spend the 15 for 1 month and make your own decision!
---
Pick another server or wait.
---
Levelled at bit on Firemaw, queue was too long so switched to Flamelash.
---
Now waiting in a queue on Flamelash. Am I supposed to switch server again?
---
Keep exiting and re entering and eventually you'll glitch in, could take hours could take minutes, depends on how glitchy the blizzard setup is
---
Nah, they barely let in any people to the stress test, no wonder the servers are burning.
---
Meanwhile I lost 15s on my bad boy 6slot bags
---
I don't remember that from Vanilla. 
---
Doesn't seem very classic.
---
I have this in ESo. While I love the game, it's not the best system. Log in, rarely see the same people aside from those in large trade guild. Often you log into their server instances but sometimes... nope. Entirely random
---
:o I learned something new. Thanks!
---
Not really, it's pretty transparent.
---
Don’t give Activision any ideas.
---
Thought so tho, but logged in 1/ secs after DC and no grace
---
Evidence has been linked at least twice in this thread and you throwing a tamper tantrum and calling people sexist and idiots who do baseless claims makes it very easy to disregard you as a lunatic permanently offended SJW.
---
If you had put the effort of nicely showing me that I'm wrong instead of baselessly claiming that I am (factually being wrong by all evidence in this thread) and attacking me over it, this cinversa2woulconversation would have gone entirely differently as evident by my reactions to the people who don't behave like asshats.
---
Don't expect to be treated like a nice conversation partner when you're so utterly obnoxious in the presentation of your opinions.
---
As a doctor of classic wow, i prescribe you a big dose of git gud
---
People are lazy. And kids today don't know what it means to sit still for more than 30-40 minutes at a time and concentrate on something.
---
They want it all. Now. Right now. No patience. 
---
Fuck those people.
---
'only'
---
? The game is out since 2004 and BC was in 2007, and it didn't exist when i played.
---
Shazz
---
as total n00b can i ask what the difference is between a pouch and runecloth?
---
Did the same, just came home and still 8k in the queue. Moving to another server for now
---
They'll never change retail, mtx bring in way more money than subscribers ever will. All i hope is they don't add mtx to classic.
---
for sure. the implications of classics success is that the newest content is inferior and if I were a retail dev I would be a little worried internally.
---
I don't even know how accurate blizz's are,  I'm watching my position in queue go the wrong way sometimes...
---
So what? My friends aren’t moving. So I’m not. Wow is a social game and blizzard knows this. I’m going to complain until they drop free server transfers in the next few days.
---
100% agreed
---
Sadly this is probably true.. sorry!
---
Nice.
---
You dont stay a multi billion dollar Company forever, by treating your customers like this.
---
Everyone is finishing work and trying to log on an ago ago no queue in 2 hours I’m guessing 15k
---
Yeah I deleted one of my high pop toons last night and started on a medium. The wait was 34 minutes. Which isnt bad. Gives time to watch some YouTube, use the bathroom, and get some food.
---
Yeah, 16K queue right now.
---
Dude thats awesome.
---
I had many a similar encounter myself last night. (Except without the phatty reward)
---
I doubt multiboxing is so prevalent as to actually factor in as a monetary incentive. If anything I imagine the practice is obscure enough that it has never become disruptive to the degree that they've felt a need to address it.
---
Just relog :D
---
Where did I say they should drop money on new servers? maybe your reading comprehension could use some wonk next time your in queue for 8 hours.  And die off in a week? they only reason that would happens is people like me quitting because they cant even get an hour in. 
---
&gt;You know what would suck even more than queues? Releasing a bunch of servers and having them all low pop after 3 weeks when the hype dies down. Then having to deal with the logistics of server transfers/merges, people losing their reserved name/etc.
---
Yes, lets cater to the few hundred people that would have to lose a name over the hundreds of thousands that cant even fucking play, you apologists really need to close the jaw, the defense of this is pathetic.
---
You're assuming a few things:
---
1. That low pop servers don't have enough people to maintain a good community. This is wrong. Low pop servers today have more people than full pops did in vanilla.
---
2. That even if the server does die, blizzard won't do anything about it and won't offer transfers. I would bet my left nut that they will.
---
I tried Firemaw, but it's just too busy man. Tomorrow it'll be the same shit all over again, so I just rerolled to another server with medium population. Still has a queue of about 130 min, but it's far less insane.
---
So a "medium" population on the realm select screen is a  5k queue.
---
Yes 1
---
Spoken like a true sommelier!
---
Yeah it’s driving me a bit crazy, was in queue for 7 hours before I finally got to play and now I’m looking at another 7 hour queue
---
Just type in beginners guide classic wow on YouTube you will find TONs of stuff. Also every two levels you will go to your class trainer in small towns and cities and you will learn more powerful spells to train so you can kill enemies faster. Also if you happened to roll on incendius add : Dime to your friends list and I can answer any question you every have.
---
I am sure he is happy it has paid off and happy they his eyes have been opened but he definitely was completely out of touch with reality originally.
---
Joining and leaving queue bumps you up?  I saw my queue number go up a few times last night and was wondering wtf that was about.
---
How much for 5 cubes?
---
We cant get the charter we get the box where you type in the name and you press purchase  and nothing happens
---
I'm cured, it all makes sense now.  Thank you so much for the detailed help!
---
They’re all going to be fine
---
I didn’t even think of setting it up remotely. Someone else here suggested a google chrome app. I suppose either should work!

Play retail if you are new.
---
Shadowmeld while hp regenerates is based.
---
Nice. I spent 9 hours in a queue, go DC'd 30 minutes later, and ended up back at the end of the queue. I went to sleep instead.
---
Population cap is the number at which players have to start queuing. Layers are the server segmenting itself into smaller groups. Say a server is capped at 30k players, each layer may be capped to like 8k players.
---
I have to choose between my health and not getting a 4 hours queue on a server that i was toldi should switch too because of queues. Lawsuit when?
---
Only thing that's gonna happen is players leaving, q times should go down for all of them eventually and if for whatever reason a server becomes dead blizz said they'd fix it
---
I got kicked from character screen when I went to bed last night. Ofc I don't know if it was a random disconnect.
---
I didnt join late??????
---
Wow. Well grats on getting in.
---
When they had crashes yesterday, queue spike on the mega servers above 100k
---
haha, I do that too.
---
Oh, also take note of your Mana when you do run by buffs.  i did that last night on my priest and died cause a mob agro'd me. Buff is cost of 3 smites :-(

Ofc the dude I buffed sat there drinking while I died.  Yes, he was there, i saw him sit to drink......

Are you back home and can share it now?

I only have a shitty pdf Version with really bad screenshots..

Yeah what this guy said

Question is working well. It isnt quite like retail but it gives you an idea then you work for it. Personally prefer it. I know I'm in the right direction or area. Then I have to work

There is a classic version of wowhead so I would start with that. Are you familiar with wowhead? The classic version of the site is similar to the regular site so it's not too confusing.

Try 6. It's been about 2,000 an hour, so at 12,000 you're looking at at least 6 hours. Good thing you queued now.
---
That needed an upvote
---
The entire fact that you think having no expectations of Activision to care about us is ***defending*** them means you're not playing with a full deck of cards.

+1 for skinning also grabbed leather working as I’m not speed levelling and you always have spare change

I had to get to 1 last night but it just depends. If you are position 50 and 50 people leave at once it will probably jump in. When whitemane crashed (or blizz mass kicked idk) my friend when from position 11,000 to character select.

No you're just really new tbh

More than that lol
---
Im stealing every mob around me with moonfire, I guess they like you more.
---
The chrome app would definitely be my choice, but I’m not sure if that works with phone. I personally might get in trouble if I’m remoting from my work PC
---
Have fun dealing with that (maybe), I waited 2 years I'm not compromising my position on a guaranteed successful server to play immediately and risk abandoning my main in 2 months.
---
Tourists are occupying these low pop realms. It is going to backfire hard if you arent one of them.
---
Thank you so much, that's incredibly helpful! I'm on Old Blanchy but I appreciate the help!
---
It's pretty much luck, if you keep trying to re enter it may place you lower or higher, and just keep trying until you luck out like I did
---
yikes

Tagging mobs is easy at lv 4 when you get charge lol 1

When people have been 60 for a while they are thinking about potentially adding paid transfers.

dude, i was in kharanos or whatever and this dude converted 40 leather scraps into leather for me! he leveled up his level working, mutually beneficial economy!!
---
I wrote down my numbers for science.  I queued at 10:51 and got in at 12:58.  Started at 5130, so around 40 positions per minute.

NA logic.
---
That is adorably tragic.
---
Its always amusing when people complain about queue times that are less than half of most other servers,and I'd be so happy to even have your queue times lol
---
And then it goes mid and ques start... "Oh no, it's beginning ..."
---
Only solution is people move servers but they refuse. As for keeping people from anti-AFKing, how?
---
Just play on low pop servers. If you don't have a group of friends to commit to, you won't have to deal with queues.
---
I literally just said that I have and don't agree with you. Good thing you're not a lawyer like you said.
---
You're planning for the future vs people like me who just want to play our childhood game again and will deal with the dead-server later
---
My friends are already split across 3 servers now because of this.  I expected it, and tried to tell em to be patient, but it's nearly completely killed my desire to play the game now.  Feels bad man
---
Wtf is fortnite dude? Its 2004!
---
Don’t you think those servers will be super dead in like 2 weeks though?
---
i'll @ you when naxx drops and my server isnt dead ;)
---
Hydraxian Waterlords too. No queues, no dc, no lag.

Got to stay hydrated bro
---
If you don't like reading quests, figuring out where they are and how to complete them, MMOs might not be for you.
---
I was in queue for 9 hours and the exact same thing happened to me.
---
Awesome.  Thank you.  I had no idea.
---
To be fair Blizzard told everyone to get the fuck off those servers. If they didn't listen then I don't think they'll listen now.
---
Thank you very much
---
Logged out after 20 mins. Do someone a favour and log out properly to let them in
---
I legit almost teared up reading this because of how much I miss that sort of thing.  I came originally from EverQuest and that sort of thing was a big deal and how you made lifelong friends because the death penalty was so severe. I used to enjoy being high level and going to lower level areas and basically just hanging out and making sure nobody got hosed if they got in over their heads.
---
I was worried when WoW came out that the less severe death penalty would disincentivize that sort of behavior and I was very happy to see that it didn't and that WoW had just as awesome a community as EQ
---
Check out "Classic+, @OP. There's actually an entire subreddit devoted to this idea (because the mods here got sick of these posts). [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/)
---
this man is speaking gospel.
---
CRINGE
---
My guild and friend networks listened and Switched. But of course the new available servers were equally packed not long after. And it was not possible to organize everyone's networks to commit to moving to a third server a few days from launch. And of course, the only candidates were server that did not exist yet.
---
There is a reason your server is empty. Pve is lame
---
Interesting
---
Yeah I made a guy on  Incendius last night around 5:30 and got in no problem.  Figured since it was brand new wouldn't be massive queues.  Friend just texted me and said 7k people in queue already.  People aren't even out of work yet
---
Yeah you're special alright
---
You were able to play the game. Just not on the server you wanted. Oh no....
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
Yep, looks like DX11 is the oldest supported version. Classic is using a new client, so the requirements should be similar or the same as retail. Here are the reqs, they don't mention minimum required directx version.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/243159
---
It wasn't. Downvote all you guys want.
---
Blizzard was not prepared. Shocker, I know.
---
Lol, just switch servers. Server caps are a good thing for wow, otherwise layering will never be gone. It is bad that there's not enough servers though.
---
No problem
---
i wont defend this, blizzard 100% undershot the population estimates and will for sure have to do something about it \*for free\* specifically.
---
They can't use the new servers because they have maximum amount of players per account. And you can't delete a character without entering the realm it's in
---
Sure, Lets all go re-roll onto the new Ashbringer server they released a few hours ago.
---
Oh wait it's already got a fucking queue, how about we go to Dreadmist inste- oh wait, that's already got a queue.
---
Saying "Lul just change servers" when there's no servers to change to isn't a solution.
---
some more data:
---
t= 0 min, 5130
---
t = 29 min, 3402

EU RP realm is low pop now. I really didnt wanna go to RP PVP because I feel like its gonna be 50% of realm is rogues type of gankfest while leveling.

First mob I killed on login dropped me a 6 slotter.
---
There are changes though. They said they were implementing laying to deal with exactly this issue in the starter zones.
---
They had free transfers from overpopulated realms to lower populated realms every now and then. They should have that now too. They should put up another 5-6 realms and allow free transfers for everyone.
---
Buy a case and sell it as collectable online xD

---
lol alright
---
you paid for retail wow. they just ALLOWED you to create and name a character on a different version of the game which is free.
---
any server can be low, medium or high pop. they can go up and down
---
Buuuuuuutttt low pop realms will die I wanna play Herod next to steamers and cool kids!!!! Wahhhhhh blizzard OWES ME MONEY AND VIP LOGIN!!!!#($+;_!2+_!+3!_!!!
---
How do you drop the ball on common sense
---
I get your point, and agree with you to an extent, but I don't think expecting to be able to play a game on the day it's released is unreasonable.
---
Probably when they force you to play their game and it's not a conscious decision you're making knowing that's detrimental to your wellbeing.
---
Dude it's day one chill
---
Yes thats what I'm saying, you're rejoining the queues wherever you quit out of if you reconnect within 5 minutes.
---
You're not glitching the system, you're literally just sitting through the queue doing extra BS for no reason.
---
You don't understand. Blizzard is smarter than us. This how it should be, use the new server you complainer.
---
Paid transfers. For fucks sake with that launch they should allow free transfers to everyone so we could level normally without sitting in 20k people queue just because we want to play with friends instead of getting in a server that will be low pop in a month from now,
---
Dude, take a break and go get some sleep. This is unhealthy.
---
Im waiting in the queue and somehow I went from 1305 to 1307. 2 people somehow cut me in line. What even?
---
Lol lets see how many players stick around.  Could be a million, could be 50x less. Who knows.
---
Yeah, that’s what I thought too.  I’m on a medium server I thought there won’t be much of a queue!  40 minute queue.  🙁
---
Several of them are already past level 20, so that’s not likely. They’re true no-lifers
---
&gt; Then again from someone who lives through this game vicariously, 
---
Ive never played it... ever... good lord. And this is rich coming from someone defending to the death a company that clearly dropped the ball, maybe because I never played I could actually criticize the poor performance unlike you triggered babies defending a clear utter failure.
---
Thanks for the idea lolol
---
Anyone in que on Blaumeux? I’m paying my little sister $5 to login and run around so I don’t get a que when I’m home from work
---
Yea I honestly thought that’s what we all expected for the first few days

Everyone knew there was going to the risk of technical issues.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-realm-names-and-types-updated-aug-27/246645
---
Sounds like premeditation?
---
Very unlikely. There are way more players than those few slammed servers can support. They’ll have to go somewhere.
---
Wow has something those other games dont have though, which is polish, charm, and character. The world feels alive and looks damn good. World building goes a long way.
---
Pretty sure this is not allowed, as it is considered witch hunting.
---
It's getting worse as the day goes on.
---
Not any that I know of...
---
U gonna tell him no? You gon be snackys
---
Thats what im talking about, blizzard doesnt list them manually, they get automatically listed based on other realms, which means herod/shazzrah etc. are so overpopulated atm that they skew all the others making them appear as medium/low. They said they are working on fixing this, specifically making any realm with a que = full
---
World of Waitcraft
---
They have this technology; they use it for retail servers.  The whole point of Classic is to recreate Classic.
---
Not toxic, just pretty much a fact. Retail is garbage atm.
---
This. I don't really blame the players for this - it's Blizzards fault because of the way they handled the premade characters. Once you get a guild, or an entire community (Spanish speakers, etc.) locked into a server, in Discords, etc. it's *really* tough to get people to leave. They needed more servers at the start instead of the drip-fed ones we've been getting.
---
Jfc you were every hunter I ever met in BC
---
Can place them into the folder alright but they won't be active until you restart the game.
---
Good idea to wait it out. Nobody knows what servers will look like a month from now. We can only speculate. Hope you’re able to play with your friends. Best of luck
---
That's a terrible idea. So your telling me people who had to sit in a 6-8 hour queue dont have as much of a right to play the game as someone who hit the rng jackpot?
---
Move servers or WHY YOU ALWAYS CRYINGGG
---
Deactivate it in discord settings
---
But I already have a character and 6 hours of progress. Also. What low population servers. They are all fucking fukl. 
---
Blizz needs to open free realm transfers and more realms to balance this shit out
---
I would think they already have a game plan put together.. Just don't want to release any information about it because it's so far off at this point that they want to be able to make changes if they need to before telling people what they're planning
---
Haha I call my remote desktop app my girlfriend too!
---
Some back story - was running around trying to find UC, asked a stranger for a tip, they were kind enough to take the time to take me exactly where I needed to go, small talked a bit.. next time I logged I received this in the mail (50 silver which at this point is a lot) who says the wow community is toxic??
---
No - there are no structured rewards at all in this phase. The rewards come with the honor system to be released at a later time. Druids are gods in PvP, both world and battlegrounds.
---
&gt; should be killing mobs constantly to max your xp
---
Imagine actually believing this
---
I also answered your question about reducing load on the GPU while the game is in the background.
---
As someone who decided to hop on at the very last second, due to his friend urging him on, I can attest, Blizzard was not ready for late arrivals.
---
It’s a setting in discord, not for wow. Forget exactly what it’s called, but it’s in your settings somewhere
---
dont blame the sysadmins Im pretty sure they are not the ones making decisions on servers, its the budget/finance guys since adding servers/making them more scalable cost money. Im sure the budget they had for classic was not set with the actual workload being displayed now. so resetting all these variables mean that a lot of people are involved and the hole process is extremely long. not the sysadmins fault in the end.
---
The community should start a campaign for him to eat a literal hat
---
I could see things getting better after the weekend, maybe around next wednesday.
---
Well I'm a new player myself that was too young to play at launch and have loved every minute I've played today.
---
Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bandage
---
am in Tallahassee, might have to swing by publix tonight and look for it.
---
Overlay Settings in discord
---
okay thanks for the helpful advice
---
Thats me
---
You get it from your trainer at tailoring level 45.
---
If the queue is 3 hours instead of 13 it doesn't mean that the server is dead, it means that all the morons rolled on the same handful of servers and refused to leave.
---
That's scary accurate
---
I’m imagining you stroking your microdick while typing that out.
---
Blizzard kept saying there will be very long queues on some servers and told players to move to other servers to avoid queues.  
---
But it seems like in EU they need to add more servers today.
---
which you clearly have no clue how they work, but hey, making sure a few people don't get upset over losing names in a merge vs hundreds of thousands that cant even play at all? when you can understand logic come back and well talk, until then theres no point with a blizzard white knight.
---
Pagle, but it's giving me estimated 60 minute queue
---
Those sound like awful people.....where does one even going about getting this anti afk software.....purely academic of course.
---
Rathole to rathole Futterman.

This is exactly why I took next week off work instead. Its like none of these people have ever expierenced a launch day for a big game.
---
Is it lonely up there on your cloud of judgement?
---
Honestly i think any of the 5 big pvp servers right now will be a good choice. 
---
From my personal experience mograine seems like the best choice. It seems to have the main server for everyone actually speaking English, a lot of brittish, dutch and scandinavian people. And from all the discords and stuff everyone is really nice for some reason lmao. Also the realm pop seems to be the most balanced one, very even split between horde and alliance.
---
I'm on Kurinnaxx, where are you hearing that it's the overflow hardcore pvp server?
---
Stoked if that's the case, but I don't think anyone can honestly make that claim. Deciding whether or not to re-roll for a better long-term experience.
---
It's like the Truman show but creepy and real life.
---
Just logout and leave it on the queue. I'm sure that when you come back you'll still have around 1 hour of queue left.
---
And some douchebag said "you think you want, but you don't"
---
That was actually included in my comment.
---
&gt;My comment was that Blizzard used layers as a method to address the giant populations at startup. The subtext (that I guess I should have made explicit) was that they are doing this so that once tourists leave, they don't have dead servers. That was the intention. Whether it meets that will remain to be seen, especially when queues last night were sometimes 10x the vanilla server cap.
---
This is like complaining about people saying ur instead of you're
---
\&gt; I  remember back in vanilla the mage would always always ALWAYS start a pull with pyroblast and then jump around going oom with arcane explosion. 
---
Glad to hear it wasn't only me!
---
Meanwhile, the baby is break-dancing in the crib, and you have no proof!
---
So... what your saying is...
---
If you have no life and grind for a few days you should have priority over people who finally have a chance to login and level?
---
Some of the mental gymnastics that some of the WoW playerbase does is crazy. You would get a perfect 10 in insanity.
---
agreed. i had the most fun playing last night that I have since BC (highschool for me). cant fucking wait to get home from work
---
you are retarded
---
Exactly, Google it, there are guides
---
The issue isn't about not notifying. The issue is we literally don't have an alternative to avoid the crap wait times. I'm ok with waiting but when all the servers are starting at 2+hrs que time when I get home from work then that is a problem on the company side. 
---
The weekend is literally going to be impossible
---
Yes, Dwarves are the best race for Priests on Alliance due to Fear Ward.
---
Yeah better ignore reality and stick yer head in the sand.
---
I had 3 bags before I hit 4. I was convinced they upped the drop rate. Nope, other character got none and neither did my two buddies. Weird.
---
I'm happy I was thinking ahead and booked a week off starting Sept 1st lol.
---
Coungratulations!
---
I fail to see how that was whining about queue times. It is a fact that queue times are fucked, I stated that fact.
---
Slyngel alliance night elf hunter EU firemaw https://m.twitch.tv/slyngel_
---
32 as of now
---
Maybe the population wouldn't die off if people could actually consume the service they paid for. Has anyone ever considered that?
---
No I'm playing by myself now because my friends got in and are ahead of me because I have work all week. When I got home I couldn't get in by the time I went to sleep. So I'm now leveling by myself on Ashkandi but it's pretty unenjoyable when everyone I want to play with is on a server I can't join.
---
abandon 20+ of my friends who I have been gaming with for 10+ years? Ok good idea
---
You can still create characters on full servers. They don't get locked.
---
You didn't think at all before you sent that message, didn't you?
---
Give Omar a fucking raise. Usually moving senior programmers out and into management is a bad idea, but I trust him.
---
Amen brother.
---
It's amazing at how bad higher level positions are with basic Excel functions, they think I am a god damn Mage when I use basic alt commands.
---
9 minutes?
---
Dude, what server are you on?!
---
These people would rather sit at the back of a 20,000 queue than roll on a low or even medium server.
---
Not the brighest bunch.
---
To be fair what you described in your second paragraph was 100% what it was like for me yesterday. Took a whole 5 minutes or so for ice armor to cast. Another 5 minutes for any of the mobs to spawn in. Was lagging around the undead area with no NPCs or enemies for a good 10 minutes waiting for everything to load.
---
All I hear in my head when someone says 'que' is a spanish man asking me a question.
---
Still fighting the que boss
---
Blessed mom
---
Go on
---
Are you planning on doing raids in the future?
---
So I would need to do the hardest raids to get the proper gear to pvp ? Or I can buy it I guess if I farm gold ? I have heard druids are not the best at grinding but they are ok since they are fast.
---
Aww downvotes.... it's 100% part of the game, not like I cheated :) lol  
---
Or was the downvote for telling people?
---
sorry if it sounds off topic, but how are people supposed to make a group for dungeon since the channels are bound to their layers ? there could be a healer lfg in one and a 4/5 group ready to go only missing a healer and they could miss each other, i find it a bit sad and anti vanilla spirit.
---
Skullflame?  The post is talking about Ten Storms.
---
none cares fuck em.
---
Uhuh. 
---
I wish I could point at that guy and laugh right now.
---
Yeah I tried with Garrick too, but no one listened. Jokes on them though cause my latency is fantastic and I got the tag second try after giving up on the line.
---
I work and got home to only a 20 queue after a full shift so I dunno. Though to be fair I get off at 8pm pst so my experience is prob different than most.
---
Questie, Bartender, OmniCC, Luna Unit Frames
---
Why you joining a server that busy if you don’t have a character there yet?
---
Idk what kind of server youre on, but there were 100 people huddled around Zalazane's spawn last night on Blaumeux.. and thats just the way it should be.
---
ya thats a tough spot to be in, im at the point where ill just make new friends.
---
Healing is the on-ramp to friend making
---
Maybe look into getting a steam controller. It can do all sorts of advanced stuff, might work well
---
I disagreed until i read it. I have 13 hours on whitemane and now i feel like anything i do is a waste of time. I havnt gone to bed either
---
&gt; The playerbase has 0 responsibility or liability in this matter, they have the luxury to complain about everything. 
---
yesssss!!!
---
This sub has been shitting over every decision Blizzard has made for months. it's so easy to criticize from behind a monitor when you know none of the specifics.
---
You could, you know, ask them.
---
I don’t get home till after 11 anyway. I can’t imagine the wait tonight taking longer than last night. And if it does, oh well. I’ll wait.
---
Just shift click their name
---
cringe keyboard
---
Wait until you get that 90 minute queue on a Medium server only for it to turn in to 10 hours. Like...I don't even know what is happening now.
---
Sounds like you should change realms
---
I moved to one of the ones they opened and now it has a 6k queue lol (Incendius)
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure dynamic respawns are enabled.
---
corpses barely have time to despawn when the next one comes up.
---
Also a trick in vanilla is that you can leave a mob unlooted and it'll take about 5 minutes to despawn, and then another few seconds to respawn.
---
So loot your kills if you wanna share them, don't if you want to get to a chest or something.
---
It is not a pleasant feeling to do content for 8 hours and then face the option of either rerolling to redo the exact same content or not play at all.
---
Blizzard was overconfident in the ability of layers to fix issues with the hype.
---
So huge queue. I literally can't play. Also, I hate disconnects!
---
I remember watching paymoneywubby a couple years ago with my girlfriend. Is he a big thing now? I don't really follow streams
---
Queue status for skeram? Wanting to play once I get home from work but seems unlikely...
---
That's 1 more than elemental shamans

LOL they were not a relatively small company nor was it their first major release. They were the company that put out Warcraft I II and III, Diablo I and II by then. Those are major triple A releases. Blizzard was a giant already and that's why they were able to put so much into wow. I know there's no way this needs to be explained; that would be crazy.  Just about every game they put out sets new records for people calling in to work in the US. They handled this release exactly as they should have. Staged release of servers to put out as few as possible while still supporting the demand. There were plenty of servers people just didn't want to move. That's not blizz fault that's just humans being stubborn.
---
Options bad.
---
Spam chat good.
---
There are no "relatively empty" servers. There's full servers with queues and borderline full servers without them.
---
Ya, I was watching other players die and not helping them so that i could tag the mobs after they died lol.
---
Yea this is kinda why I don't really pity warriors as much as everyone else. The difficulty of leveling is overstated (tons of people here did it when they were like 12), and they are the best at pretty much everything but healing when they get to late game.
---
Yeah should have banned Questie
---
 Why don’t you move servers and stop being a puss?
---
Retribution Paladin was pretty bad in Vanilla and you won't find many dungeon slots. You are heavily (if not most of all classes) dependant on gear and outside PvP and/or highend equipment (AQ40+) you're not considered useful outside blessings.
---
I love me some classic wow, but It has got to be one of the most boring things to watch on stream holy cow. Especially now when there’s a lot of queues and competition.
---
The quote is infamous and I know the faces but I could care less about who they are individually. Both are interchangeable douchebags.
---
Play whatever you want. It’s a long grind and it’s better to be happy with your character than to finally hit 60 and regret it!!
---
Yeah I noticed that this morning and got right in.  Not really sure how that works since I thought the population was indicated by how many registered characters were on it?
---
I guess melee isn't dead in Classic.
---
This man song For the Power of the Horde.
---
He's also responsible for the cartoony/fantasy artstyle WoW has.
---
One of early Blizzard's key figures, would not have been this big without him in my opinion.
---
All of those douchebags are the epitome of what is wrong with WoW/streamers.
---
I can confirm that this works. I had to reboot to fix my sound and I disconnected myself through another client and I had no queue.
---
I sat @ 45 for about an hour yesterday so pretty normal.
---
god fucking damn.... /r/murderedbywords.
---
Im not even going to reply to anyone in this thread anymore, just link this post instead lol
---
You can always change realms.  Nothing is forcing you to stay other than your own decision.  You can convince your group of friends to change if you hate your server.
---
agreed. I was fine waiting in my 8 hour queue whole I did chores and watched tv, but getting dc'd after 10 minutes and getting put right back at the end of the line really soured me on the launch.
---
It’s been pouring down in tirasfall glades all day

Yes, it's unplayable on the EU servers. I got home at 6pm and went to queue up. It's 9:39pm and I am still in a 10k queue. So basically this won't be finished by 12am tonight (6 hours!)
---
MMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH THE FRENCH!
---
download google remote desktop , entered Que while at work work from mobile phone. this what I've done, and it has lowered my time waiting in Que while at my PC substantially.
---
you are doing it wrong. You go protection then get a shield and 1 wep.
---
The thing that baffles me is that they used to be really good at it.
---
Hiring someone like Hazzikostas was a huge mistake. You don't want a hardcore raid leader designing your game, you want like... a passionate sociologist. Or a visionary like Kojima. Hazzikostas looks at a system like weapon skills and says 'well, this is obscure for casuals and pointless for hardcores, so let's do away with it', completely ignoring the fact that *it's something to do* and *it builds an immersive world*. 
---
Yeah, I doubt retail will ever change course, but it would be bittersweet if Classic WoW murdered retail.
---
Unfortunately not.  I have a 5 button mouse only, but two of those buttons are still unused so I'll definitely add some things to those such as battle shout.
---
Lol. Lighten the fuck up.
---
Sulfuras is full now? I was able to log on when they released it last night.
---
not true, warrior is the most rolled class in any given server, in xp phase it's the most easy spot to fill. basically any warrior with mail and a shield is fine, even druide feral is fine too
---
Shit is whack! I closes the client entirely and restarted everything, my position in que was 15k+, then ten seconds later I'm at 344...
---
Or, crazy idea. Message them in discord and collectively decide to join a new server.
---
Best realm is full post yet
---
there's nothing *easy* about herding 40 people through a raid
---
Dude, a baby in 3 days, how will you find the time to play WoW classic?!
---
Unless theyre all unemployed losers they should be waiting in queues too.
---
Or get smarter friends who will switch
---
Skeram didn't have a queue from like 2am - 10am, by noon it was ~1500.
---
It only really matters if you are min/maxing. Most guilds will likely invite a player based on their gear and skill, not which race they play. (The exception being Priests, which have race-specific spells that come in handy for specific encounters.)
---
You’re new to game aren’t you? Your point is not only invalid, it’s asinine. Most people coordinated with their guilds and friends to play on a server that works for their time zone, now you want us to just forget all that planning and join a dead server? No. Make them bigger. If retail wow, which is trash, can hold this many people, so can classic.
---
I had rain in Tirisfal Glades for a few hours Yesterday
---
If you're decently well geared at level 60 then you'll be able to comfortably handle a few mobs at once. Leveling in classic has always been generally limited to killing one enemy at a time, though.
---
So your upset that you have to wait in a queue because of massive player counts? 
---
The game is 100% functional with little errors from I’ve seen. Your waiting in a queue, cry me a river.  This is miles better than the bfa launch retail had.
---
Most likely. They weren't dxracer or secretlabs, just some janky product.
---
Well that's a kickass server name no surprise people rolled there

Yo I saved this guy from death with two of my friends and he gave me green legs with intellect which was a huge upgrade as I'm a mage

---
Just group up with 4 others and ninja tag, faster for everyone.
---
Sorry guys lol. Just found it funny that on day one people are complaining about queues like they didn’t think it was gonna happen. I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard is artificially making the queues like this just to take the piss. Sorry I didn’t mean to sound salty. Was the first comment I came across after opening reddit and since then I have found like 3 more so yeah. Just funny to me. Rose tinted glasses have people messed up.
---
Audibly laughed
---
Idk ask the people who ran macros and get banned. Blizzard has a way of detecting when someone is running an auto clicker or a repeating macro like that
---
For some reason I wasn't lucky.  DCed around 11 pay from whitemane.  Luckily I was planning to go to sleep soon but I would have liked to be at an inn.
---
Yeah was about to say blacklist him because thought he said VC instead of DM.
---
You're good, you can make out now.
---
It was insta about 30 mins ago. Population says low which worries me.
---
What is your solution to circumvent technological capabilities?
---
Ha that’s exactly me. The crash that booted Asmon got me too, and my 7 hours of attempted play time resulted in me hitting level 3. Oh well, it’ll work itself out here soon enough.
---
&gt;that will quit because it's actually a grind and not easy
---
You're assuming they'll get past the queue's to start with.
---
I dunno, but if you get caught using a macro to afk while you're asleep or some shit, I hope they get a 7 day ban.
---
I played on an RP-PvP server for part of The Burning Crusade - it was a cool experience. You still have mostly regular joes, but with some super family oriented (and not so family oriented) players mixed in.
---

As a paladin I've definitely had those experiences so far just in Elwynn Forest. I spent several hours using a cracked sledgehammer that I was given for saving a warrior from dying to a couple of kobolds, haha
---
He is called Hibernia xD   
---
Nono I was a proud Zerk I hated Hibs with all my pasion  
---
I like Druid over those.  SO I can just buy the stuff ? And do pvp without needing pve besides farming gold ?  
---
And what do you think of  soloing and world pvp how does it work, can I just stay arround zergs leeching do I need to group ?
---
 not true, warrior is the most rolled class in any given server, in xp phase it's the most easy spot to fill. basically any warrior with mail and a shield is fine, even druide feral is fine too
---
Do you really believe it’s kids doing this?
---
Usually Easter.
---
in retail wow I played horde and most of my server were horde and it sucked because I had trouble finding alliance to kill.  But my punishment for joining the band wagon.  Although I enjoyed playing horde because of the great characters in horde such as thrall, garrosh, lady sylvanas, and baine I rolled alliance in classic to be an underdog.  One time on my server I went afk and a rogue killed me.  Someone typed "theres a dick rogue around".  10 horde gathered trying to find him.  He was killing horde members left and right as a rogue in stealth.  I said to myself, thats what i wanna be in classic.
---
Questie
---
Ive seen level 15s every 3 hours all night
---
Pretty sure nostalrius  was hosted in Paris
---
it really doesn't matter, unless your guild is super into min/maxing for raiding.
---
back in vanilla, I never saw a human get picked over a dwarf.
---
How would they detect this?
---
LOL Expectation &gt;&lt; Reality. :)  
---
Sorry, you'll have to surf porn on your own time.
---
MAGA trolls are a sizeable subset of all trolls, and many are not very creative about it. I think that they should be criticized, but not for trolling in general, and instead for the specifics of their trolling being weak.
---
Sorry, you may be thinking of the other pet class.
---
Play what you want. You will still be invited to groups. 
---
Only the worst kinds of groups would exclude you from participating in dungeons and raids.
---
Us AAP ( Azeroth Auto Pilot) worked great on BFA and got me to lvl 9 last night in 3.5 hours before everyone DCed.
---
Exactly what I thought
---
Yeah if he can play on 21 keyboards fine, but if he is using some other software it's basically cheating.
---
there you go

---
That is one of the reason I made this tool, too much spam in the chat to reliably form groups!
---
1-10 is generally quick for retri, while 10-20 is your weakest point. At level 20 you will obtain seal of command and 2h mace from.class quest, that is far superior to average rare at 20lvl. You will end up hitting like a truck. This damage slowly decays as you progress and 50-60 is your slowest phase again.
---
You've never given any rationale. Just spouted random phrases without any justification.
---
It clearly does not reduce cost.
---
It clearly encourages Blizzard to use as few servers as possible with a healthier population distribution.
---
The game is based on the modern client and should be able to use the same systems for character transfers. The only dev time investment I can see is setting up the transfer rules and create a UI  to direct people to the option.
---
It would also optimize server load for a better overall experience. It's the same reason they use layering.
---
Thank you for all this detailed info.  I appreciate it.

**&lt;General Goods&gt; | EU | Alliance | PvE Pyrewood Village**
---
**Guild Info**
---
A warm, friendly and welcoming guild focused on PvE content, leveling and dungeons. Aiming to do some casual raiding. Would suit casual members with restricted play time, young or old. PvP players are more than welcome and if other members are keen regular guild PvP events can be arranged. For now we aim to focus on the return of the greatest video game of all time and to enjoy the journey with the good friends we'll meet on the way!
---
**Currently Recruiting**
---
We are currently accepting members of all classes, all levels and all abilities. New and returning players most welcome. Whilst we aim to have a raid team at some point socials are always welcome and there will never be a commitment or requirement to raid.
---
 If you are interested or have any questions, join our Discord and we'll be happy to help! [https://discord.gg/sqxN6Nn](https://discord.gg/sqxN6Nn)
---
I'm working on it! She's interested, but doesn't have a computer.
---
If you get in line for quest givers you're a fucking idiot
---
Finally a server where someone didn't steal my name!
---
No,  he's saying kids get stomped by boxers.  Pay attention.
---
It's not even enough that new players steer clear.
---
In the interview he says that 10k+ queues could easily fit within several servers, but the people queuing aren't doing it haphazardly.  
---
Maybe things will be better in a month, but that's only because people would've had to endure almost ~200 hours worth of queues alone.  I prefer to play the game, but my friends are being stupid about it.
---
I think it's worse for the big servers like herod, because everyone rolling there are the people that want to be with that "in" crowd, which means their resistance to transfers is much higher (this is my friend's motivation, and it really annoys me).  My resistance is to playing without friends, but I am reaching my breaking point.

---
why would you take off of work to play during launch week lolol
---
Just do like me back in the day. Go to Grim Batol because you’re retarded and didn’t know the way at all and guessed. Then be awfully interested because it’s filled with max level dragon kin, then proceed to die for several hours because you were super duper curious and wanted to explore what was at the end of it all.
---
Ive seen this been said on a lot on posts but Im logged into my battlenet account and then hit play and then its just on the server screen so I assume so
---
ah i see. So basically wait for things to die down abit an then play.
---
I noticed you didn’t say bathing.
---
So with over 10k people in the queue, does anyone know how many players can be on a realm at once? 5k? 20k? Did blizzard ever reveal these numbers?
---
My last update on Private Servers was that basically everyone playing seriously has AQ or better gear. That wouldn't conflict with what I said.
---
more servers, same ques, the game is building more hype the longer its out.... people will get fed up at one point though, if you pay for a service and never get it, it looks more like a scam.
---
Also you: Paying for a subscription to a game you can't actually log in to play
---
'Enemy cast bar'
---
Please explain how I'm wrong then.
---
&gt;13 hours already
---
&gt;significant time investments
---
Pick one.  13 hours is nothing for an MMO, particularly one like WoW. 
---
I'm all for server transfers to lower pop realms, but it's disingenuous to call 13 hours a "significant time investment."
---
There was a #MAGA chant in my chat and #buildthewall
---
Dude as a fellow Brisbanian, I applaud your dedication in getting on to Aragul! 
---
I gave up and picked Yojamba, which is really populated too.
---
Should have gone to different que /s
---
Anyone in queue for Herod rn? Servers apparently went wonky and ppl got dc'd, dropped to #80 in queue, been stuck there for over 20 minutes now
---
Yes, they're a tool for spending their own money how they want to. You nailed it!
---
I also tend to work Ctrl into my buttons as well if needed, usually for the less needed things. On a warrior, Ctrl-1, 2, and 3 have always been my stances.
---
Well they did, but they also more than doubled the amount of servers. They launched with 4 US-East PvP and now there are 9, so they're way off.
---
100% yes. It’s such a sleek MMO. Giant community right now and everyone is starting from scratch. Don’t listen to the server people. Just play on a low population server and you’ll be fine. (Low population is still a giant server)
---
I joined in 2006 in BC. Played guild wars before I found wow.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
---
Yeah, basically. Once you get to play, youll have an amazing time tho!
---
Care to explain why?
---
I switched to lower pop servers twice before launch, and still have only been able to play 3hrs w. 4x as much queue time. Yay, my fault!
---
Thank god im on a quiet server
---
Right? As if merging servers later is even hard to do at all... so what if some servers slip in pop, just merge them. No one cares about merges.
---
I got so much does last night after work. Took out the recycle, did the dishes, installed new air filters in the cars.
---
In the grand scheme, 24 hours is not a huge amount of time. Especially in Classic. It sucks to have to start over, but it's better to do it now instead of when most are close to 60.
---
Aight I'l give it a week and then I'l give it a go!
---
upvoted. My friend group split into 3 different servers already as well. And the world of queuecraft is already starting to rub everyone the wrong way. Some are already talking about just dropping classic as its not worth the effort with 4 hour queues. (we were in Firemaw EU first, already migrated to Mograine with some of our friend group.) Firemaw 20k queue. Mograine 10k. But were "low" when we made our chars.
---
What did you have to do? Log in first?
---
The group that got in should have considered the experience of the ones that were stuck in a long queue before they played 13 hours on the overcrowded server.
---
While I enjoyed 40 mans (did 'em all) I liked the idea of 25m more because it requires less people, which makes it easier to get a group. Spent too many hours looking to fill spots to get to 40.
---
Agreed. Osrs has tremendous success, imagine if blizzard did something similar.
---
Thanks! So wands are pretty much bonus stats?
---
It's a truly insignificant difference.
---
The incessant complaining about queue times is crazy.
---
Did people really think it was gonna be anything other than this?
---
Get in queue... or wait a few days before trying.
---
Simple as that.
---
xD IRL yes
---
I swapped back to my other realm, which has no queues. Then back to Pagle again. Now 160ish but still doing the up down up down nonsense.
---
I do have that and I bought it about 4-5 hours ago I guess that could be the case but i'd imagine it's faster than that no?
---
Did you figure it out? It sounds like you don't have a subscription, or you purchased it for the wrong account. Check to make sure you didn't choose the wrong region, either. (This can happen if you're using a VPN)
---
They had  prizes for hitting 10, 15 and 20 first and managed to hit em all.
---
Just contact Blizzard I guess, they'll help you.
---
It takes time for your sub info to update. I had to wait a few hours once.
---
You too!!! Been in que for 2 1/2 hours
---
wtf you named him Hib if you hated Hibs? You animal.
---
You can buy BoE (bind on equip) on the auction house, but it's not going to fully deck you out. It is also really expensive. With some smart leveling, you can craft a lot of pieces for yourself that will be good, but you're gonna have to pve a little bit. No way getting around it completely right now, probably to fill in gaps in your build. Maybe a particular boss drops a sword you really need or something.
---
You can stay around zergs for sure, but you should have plenty of options. Solo if you want and you'll be able to find some other solo's if you know the right places, just like daoc was.
---
Phase 1 which is right now is all about leveling up and getting gear. There isn't even Honor (realm points). That gets added later, so killing people in world pvp right now doesn't even give RPs. It's all a setup for later, when you'll start to rank up in honor, similar to RR
---
low pop servers still have more players then full servers in vanilla, probably 2x as many so if even 50% stay active once layering is removed that server will be full at p2
---
I agree with this statement. But go look at blizzard press conferences regarding vanilla wow 4 years ago. They literally called the community a bunch of idiots and said it will never happen, while private servers that were more popular than retail were already thriving.
---
Just don’t bother using TeamViewer on your work computer, as they recently started blocking domain accounts from connecting to any other computers without a business license to stop people with free licenses from troubleshooting.
---
Sucks, I had to move from TeamViewer which was absolute gold, to AnyDesk, which does the same thing.
---
what if... me *am* that kind of orc?
---
It's a different experience.
---
PvE is more for people who really want to play relaxed with no worries whatsoever.
---
PvP is a much more dangerous yet immersive world where you are pretty much required to keep watch on your surrounding for potential enemy faction.   
---
More player made war between faction out in the world, and interaction between the factions.
---
I started playing wow on a PvE. I didn't feel like i missed out tho.  
---
However, after that i started on a PvP realm I never looked back.  
---
Depends on you. Read some posts on the internet on PvE vs PvP, take some opinions and make one of your own.
---
Honestly, nice to see blizzard finally taking their own game serious.
---
what are the names of the east coast PvP servers?
---
In Europe the queue the first day was 6 hours, very good release indeed..
---
Yeah sure!
---
During an interview about queue times we got a bit of info about why they didn't just open 50 servers to solve the day 1 rush because they want to make sure than once the population dips, the realms dont end up empty.
---
Relevant quote from the interview: 
---
Newman: Why not just open up more servers?
---
Hazzikostas: We are fairly sure — we can’t know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
That’s why we’re not jumping to, hey, let’s just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn’t about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering.
---
But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That’s tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
30 minutes I believe.
---
Watched a player get bullied to the point of deleting his character yesterday because he didn't hop in line immediately when some other players started telling him what to do. Glad we're keeping that toxicity out
---
Are these merely figures for what the game lists as the estimated queue times?
---
13 hours is nothing. reroll.
---
It's like cars. My dad could strip his car engine down to its base parts and reassemble it again. Nowadays, most people don't even know how to do an oil change.
---
"I know you are but what am I" ya I need to grow up? lol
---
&gt;I tried to explain it to you, but you just got more upset at me for giving you a legitimate reason 
---
in.... your opinion , you really need to drop the elitism , my first mmo launch? sorry bud wrong again. But I don't expect much from someone so condensing. Now back to the boot licking
---
Shut your dirty whore mouth with that WoW shop token talk.
---
What a terrible idea.
---
Sounds like a newb, you need a pro gamer bro? HMU.
---
Yeah, i've been here for 7 hours now
---
He became Superman because of that phone call.  Zack Snyder's Superman tho.
---
There is a way to get under without rockets and stuffs was a long time ago i did it tho 😂
---
Oh yeah, that’s the Prt Sc key.
---
I've seen.multiple things saying classic will have xrealm.  Did they change their minds?
---
Regular wow subciption yh
---
Yeah because office hours are closed I have to do a ticket which involves upload dxdiag and msinfo and all that so that is my last resort but yeah I may have to just bite the bullet, was just hoping to play tonight is all
---
Woah there buddy, that comment was higher effort than the post itself! Thanks for the upvote, and happy cakeday!
---
Shhhhh no logic allowed here.
---
THE OLD WEATHER IS BACK AND HOPEFULLY THEY DONT FUCK IT UP THIS TIME BY MAKING WOW EASY MODE BECAUSE ALL THE BABIES COUKDNT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY AND WANTED TO SPEED THROUGH EVERUTHING BECAUSE WHHHHAAAAAAA
---
#nochanges
---
Stop using the word entitled. You don’t understand what the word means.
---
Did that at Sarkoth, but the amount of people at Zalazane was ridiculous. Ended up just skipping that quest.
---
That's not it at all.   
---
From an economic standpoint Activision Blizzard over the last year has seen massive stock drops and huge lay offs. What they are doing is actually smart from a cost perspective, as they aren't running more than needed server wise to help mitigate the costs. 
---
In other words, Activision Blizzard are running on a LEAN model.
---
k
---
totally possible and worth it. There will be times you will have quests that you will need help to complete.
---
As far as lag, depends. It should be much better than it was in vanilla.
---
Human will increase your auto attack damage by around 6% so it is up to you
---
That would just require literally 3-4x the servers. And with the hype dropping off and the non dedicated leaving soon, that would create 3-4x the amount of ghost town servers.
---
&gt;some weird bug
---
Silithus is full of those.
---
Honestly, the queues are killing me. I only have a limited amount of time to play and most of that is being spent queuing. I haven't played yet this evening (UK) and will like only get an hour in before bed as I'm still waiting in queue.
---
I rolled on a Low population server which over the course of the day has gone to Medium and now High. I don't see the point in re-rolling, either.
---
Well that is stupid. If you hit level 10 first, you're more likely to hit the others first.
---
If you've put thirteen hours in, that's maybe 5% of what you'll need to reach 60. If you really want to play with your friends, that's not a ton of progress to lose.
---
Is it secret? Is it safe?
---
what do you mean UI disabled? How is that making the world more alive? sry if this is a dumb question.
---
yeah i hope so. I'm gonna wait a week before subbing
---
I'm not sure how running servers in containers to scale out and running DB joins to consolidate servers is a hassle at all
---
I have been questing without any quest helper addons and it feels pretty rewarding when you figure things out. Today in Durotar I got the quest just west of Razor Hill that asks you to obtain canvas scraps. It doesn't say anything about where to get them. It just tells you that they drop from humans and centaurs. 
---
I thought to myself where could be the best place to find these and thought the alliance fortress south-east of Razor Hill would be a good place to start. I went there, killed some humans, and sure enough, I looted a canvas scrap and it just felt rewarding figuring it out myself rather than being told what to kill and where it is.
---
Meh, they said right now low is relative. So its likely still high capacity but just low compared to say Herod. If they listed them all as full they are worried more people will just randomly pick over capacity servers they said.
---
It's gotta be more than 1.5% of the total time though, right?  Probably more like 5-10%
---
Hot damn and you’re practically at the end!
---
Someone needs to make a grubhub addon for quick access to delivery.
---
TeamViewer is a great idea. I'm gonna do this tomorrow.
---
First guy to respond to you got it right!
---
Press ALT-Z in game and everything stuck to your camera view (XP bar, quests, any in game windows, chat, actionbars) will vanish. It's easier to explore the world and notice details when the view is less claustrophobic.
---
Honestly queueing via the battle.net app should be supported
---
Whats the console command to zoom out this far?
---
So true.
---
I hope this is the case as this is where I ended up. No queues and there's always a bunch of people out and about. I've really liked it so far
---
A buddy just logged in after me and starts 2811 in queue with an est 143 min wait, and got in quicker than I did from 260's. Idk wtf is up.
---
I died last night because I healed my friend. He sat and drank and then I accidentally pulled 2 mobs at once. 
---
I was not ready. Short run though. Worked out.
---
Samwise Didier
---
We’re doomed, people are getting too lazy to type waiting
---
Your friends will lose a lot more than 13 hours by sitting in queues waiting to get in the game than they would if they just switched to one of the newer servers.
---
Yea they are OP with a wand.
---
Placeholder image, report as bug
---
Join him. It will be more fun to play with people you know imo.
---
I'm 33 and I probably watch more Twitch than play myself.
---
Heh, went from 72 to 82.... How the hell does that happen????
---
Anyone know if it would be against Terms Of Use to set an auto-clicker to click just once in order to put myself in queue while I’m at work? I know auto-lockers in game are not legal, but I’m wondering if using one to log myself in would be acceptable.
---
I plan to just stick the Darkshore Qs, maybe take the Long Swim from Menethil around L15 if it gets the best of me, but most likely I'll just be overwhelmed by AUBERDIIIIIIINNNEEEE!!!!!! \*Squeal\*
---
Because Auberdine.
---
&gt;I rolled on a Low population server
---
Played just a little bit yesterday (Also UK Server, Pyrewood). No queue yesterday, but really full starter zone, thanks to the high respawn rate I could level almost normally, and group up for killing named mobs etc. 
---
Today the same server has a +60 min queue. Whelp, I don't want to abandon my low level toon. Think I'll just wait one or two weeks until it gets a bit better.
---
*Flips through dictionary*
---
Is this on Herod? Cause I've been stuck at my position for like an hour now.
---
Layering is still in the game. I imagine if it wasn't those 100 people would've been 1000.
---
Good enough idea but you'll not get them to admit that baldly in official blue text that the populations are going to bottom out
---
Make sure you skip the scavenged supplies quest if it takes you longer than 5 minutes, the quest isnt worth the time if there are too many people!
---
I actually really dislike these kinds of options. I learned how to group up from vanilla and modern matchmaking options aren't for me.
---
I dont want to leave the game to find some or have to surf on my phone and I'd rather make some friends in game.
---
Call me old and old fashioned but I really like the classic LFG.
---
Queue will die after a few days. They probably want to spread the population over the world. Otherwise you see 30k+ ppl in one zone.
---
Good man. Keep the misses happy!
---
Well, yeah, more people who are closer to the front are in it for the long haul. They've already waited hours to get that far. There's tons of people who log in at like 19k, wait a fucking while, realize it's only down to 15k and they have no chance of getting in due to time constraints or something, and then exit the queue.
---
I guess most people have this issue...
---
I don't know honestly why they didn't just temporarily rent better server hardware and buff the servers up for launch. 12 hour queue times are insane and much more likely to kill any hype for the game off than literally anything else.
---
What a way to attract lots of new customers and build on the hype by people literally not being able to play the game ever.
---
It shows up all the time. It's just the "no icon found" icon in classic.
---
Got to lvl 2, got dc'ed had to wait another  8 hours
---
Alright mate no need to be a cunt hey?
---
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those up.
---
is JourneyWoW the highest level player so far? He's at 35 right now. Anyone ahead of him?
---
I got in after 6 hours in queue and dced 2min later, Now in queue for another 4 hours at 7k
---
What is the add-on called?
---
I’ll suggest the Tartarus or Orbweaver for RPG (or any) games.  I have access to 36+ buttons without moving my hand.
---
LMAO
---
that's nice, the wowhead one doesn't actually update
---
Depends on what you're doing. I have over 6,000 hours on OSRS but I still wouldn't want to spend 15 hours on a fresh account again since the early game is boring.
---
Same for WoW, I'm planning to spend a couple hundred hours at least but I'm not particularly fond of the idea of just re-running beginner zones.
---
Absolutely 100% against the terms of use. Any kind of automation is not allowed
---
Get teamviewer bro, it's a life saver for sure
---
It's not a command. This is the view from the opening cinematic. Shows up for about 3 seconds right before you take over your character.
---
This is the most sensible option. 
---
All new content designed with the Classic feel and mechanics. Essentially a 'what if' alternate WoW that goes a completely different direction to retail. 
---
Emerald Dream perhaps?
---
i watched the shity cam version. Did you find a good rip?
---
And it would make non extra payers unable to even get in the game at all. So might as well charge extra for Classic I suppose /s
---
I've been in a queue for 8 hours straight, don't complain about a 3 hour queue, tips for getting in when you get home from work: remote desktop, something like for example teamviewer, if you don't wanna log out, get an autoclicker when you head to the store, if you somehow get fucked by blizz and they decide to boot you out of the server, the best time to queue is at 6am local time, that's when least players are online
---
The Last Podcast on the Left has addressed it several times.
---
True. It's a tricky problem to balance on blizz's end
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Indeed.
---
Lvl 14 at 11hours....expected lv 15 by 4 hours.     
---
Harsh awakening when your duo disbands and you go b and forth from the next too difficult zone.
---
Priest is one of the easiest classes to level as long as you update the wand.

I don't think it will, I think it will take a few months for a server to die. vanilla's low/med/high/full populations are different than classic's low/med/high/full populations. 
---
Basically, classic's servers hold more people.
---
Blizzard's Warden is likely able to detect that apps like Teamviewer and Google remote desktop are running.
---
So one person taking up 21 server slots. Nice. I guess it's whatever though since each toon is a paid sub. Not that I think that's fair, but money talks.
---
Spend time with them while in queue.
---
Get home at 430 est. Queue up on Stalag. 12000 people in Queue.  ~196 min wait to get in.  Not looking good bois
---
«Never be able to play» its the first day dude, calm ur tits and wait a couple of days and u will be fine.
---
Around 10 hours for me so far, but I plan to dial it back after this a bit. Launch nights are special.
---
Would make an EU realm named for his wife pretty hilarious. Can't find her, she ran away to Europe.
---
Yeah it happens to a lot of people but i don’t know why
---
Hes in  5 man group the whole way
---
If wow ruined your life than it probably wasn't that great to begin with. Have some self control. Wow didn't make you fail out of college your study habits and poor life choices did. Wow didn't make you get fat, your lack of self control did. Etc.
---
why do I get queued behind 4k people on a medium pop server!!! reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
(that said I mustve gotten really lucky last night because I was able to play for 6h straight)
---
Some of us have switched 3 times already and still have queues. 
---
How many times is it reasonable to expect someone to start from scratch?
---
same I'm at 164 and have been here for about 45 minutes or so, guessing maybe a continent crashed or something causing some issues.
---
Thanks captain Hindsight!
---
imagine using the "imagine x" format of speaking like a meme baby
---
Have you logged into www.battle.net and checked your account details to make sure the transaction actually went through and your sub is actually activated? 
---
Were you somehow logged into a different bnet account when you bought the sub by accident? 
---
That's about all I can think of.
---
layers didn't appear out of thin error. 
---
And a ui for selecting a new realm *seems* to be quite simple
---
I love when people buff my pets. They deserve love too.
---
They don't feel like taking their shoes off to count higher
---
About 40 minutes ago, I was in a 3k queue with a 45 minute estimated wait time. It too maybe 5. Idk why it went so fast
---
The Blizzcon video explained that the debuff limit was a tech limitation in the original code. Not a game balance thing.
---
Logged in 9am approx UK, Logged out 1pm approx for Lunch, Did not DC.
---
Logged in 3pm Approx (don't ask), after approx. 30 min queue on Pyrewood Village. DC'd approx 5.45pm, on the way to hand in a Q, after which I would've logged off anyway.
---
So, about 6 hours, and I'm 7ish bars past L9.
---
Play on a different server or get more salty kid.
---
It'll stop being quite as OP when you get higher up and the level-appropriate wands are no longer hideously OP like the lesser and greater crafted ones are.
---
It'll still be pretty smooth if you play right, it just won't be as overkill.
---
You took time off work expecting to play an MMO on the day it launched? Won't be doing that again will you. Honestly, I know Blizz have fucked the launch, but why anyone expected the first 24 hours to be a smart time to book off work is beyond me. Something like this happening was so painfully obvious to anyone with the tiniest amount of experience playing online games.
---
Personally, me and my GF's toons are on our RP-PVP realm waiting patiently at level 1 for the game to be playable.
---
Well to be fair, ther is a looot more to do at level cap than there is at level 40. It's quick to get the 40 bis and the mount compared to the raid tiers/pvp sets, and there will be the phases to keep bringing people back.
---
If you want to go to SW for the AH, there isn't one. Darnassus has one, though.
---
Huh? Why would I take a day off to play a game I like that was just released? Idk I must be weird.
---
it does, but not in a hardware sense. Blizz is limiting the # of people in the starting zones because of game resources, mobs, nodes, etc. Why they don't just create more layers is a separate question.
---
This guy communities.
---
I don't remember the name, but it was on Echo Isles. The tiger pelts quest.
---
Sure, thank you!
---
Do you have to play on the same server to be able to play together, even late game stuff or raids?
---
Trust me, there are people who can play classic for 10 years straight or forever, because of the nature of the game. You can do world pvp, events, etc. Look at the vanilla pservers. Classic is here to stay, they will not alter the game in any way. What they can do, in my opinion, release tbc and have the option to copy the character on the other tbc servers. They will not risk to change anything  in classic. It’s perfect for a lot of people. I can bet that classic will stay forever if there are people to play it. Just my 2 cents.
---
Best for pvp so worth
---
That's assuming his decision was not forced on him. He's not exactly in a position to decide, or even to pass up on what is basically free benefits for the company.
---
Green means less XP cause its too easy for you
---
Destiny 2 is a dead game, no one cares.
---
Trying to explain this to anyone is impossible. Any popular game is going to be shit for the first week at least. It’s better to keep the servers from setting on fire and doing damage control for all the people bitching, rather than waste a bunch of money spinning up servers you’re going to have to get rid of later because they’re running at 2% workload. Anyone running servers plans for the norm, not the edge case that is launch.
---
All I want to know is if my queue is stuck will I eventually be put in the server
---
what faction did you roll?
---
Blizzard doesn’t care about your 5 hour queue.
---
i've swapped enough playing blizzards musical warning chairs.
---
So did y’all actually think all of this would be as massive as it is?
---
you cant really blaim people gor not waiting to wait 2-3 hours just so they can take a 15-30 min break
---
WoW Classic
---
Experience the madness in its purest/maddening form.
---
Ask someone nearby to help?
---
My friends and I abandoned our guild and just went to a low pop server. We want to play not get home and wait in a 20k person que.
---
God disconected for the 3rd time just now. And popped right back in the que. 10848 atm. This last time i didnt even get to play for 30 minutes. Now the &gt;1 - 9999 minutes wait begins again
---
Questie seemed bugged anyway, not missing much

---
You want to download the addon and then load up wow after and it should work for ya. Don’t need to do a first time lunch. My tip would be to take your time and don’t worry about rushing through it cause it’s a fun leveling experience. You’ll make a lot of friends and have fun memories on your way to lvl 60. Just remember there will be a grind but it’s not insanely mind numbingly crazy of a grind. And it’s all worth it. When you reach certain areas such as “stranglethorn vale” beware for enemy faction cause both factions can quest in the same areas sometimes. So world PvP happens and that’s super fun just good luck and have fun my guy
---
Bump
---
Thanks for the link
---
y at around 5 or was it 6. everyone im my party me included got kicked from the server. it is launch day so problems are not uncommon. still annoying as shit
---
Got called a kid by my guild. They're not wrong.
---
Yeah I'm falling asleep, it's like playing on a dead PVE server.
---
What level are you? Do you have a pet yet?
---
Layer(s) crash?, you go down thousands in queue, but those people grace period back in.  Queue basically stops moving.  I've watched it happen twice.  That is my best guess.
---
This technically isn't 1.12, though. Not everything about 1.12 is restored
---
Feels like Warlock was the most popular in the undead leveling area too, fucking imps everywhere.
---
Huh, I logged on at 8am with no queues at all
---
Few cameos in there. Nice to see
---
I hear ya, been at 10 minutes on Skerad for over an hour.  
---
The position isn't budging at all.
---
So tell me, what did the pservers do different besides obviously increasing the leveling speed?
---
A majority of the population isn't level 10 yet. Go away
---
Wasn't long-term server health the point of layering? or did they not end up going that route?
---
I want to move servers, but i'm not going to as long as I have friends sticking to one of the full-pops
---
Oh no. She gets a decent amount of sick days each year. She is just wonky in the head and has this utterly ridiculous loyalty to the company which frankly is unjustified.
---
You need to input commands or get logged out. So he's probably multi boxing. 
---
What would you like us to do about it?
---
Probably a lot of people refusing to log off. I mean if you got in, would you?
---
Faerlina. I know the low pop servers are an option, but I already have my names reserved on Faerlina and the whole guild isn't going to reroll on another server.
---
same dude. 40 minutes only +100.
---
After 9 hours waiting in queue I am officially quiting on Firemaw EU.
---
My bf got in early and then kicked out. Then had to wait another 4 hours :( but we are gonna play today after I'm done with work. He played classic back in the day and this is my first time! Can't wait :)
---
I'm in a queue now around 800.  The trip from 1k to 800 took like 45 min.  This is kinda crazy
---
I take it you must not have bothered going to one of the new servers that they've been constantly adding but wanted to complain about it anyways, right?
---
1 hour was the original mail time, anything that had items. Money and text would be sent instantly
---
wasnt is 24 hours at one point? then they made it 1 hour? between accounts? and now instant?
---
Got home at 3 and been in que since 3:05. It was 7k when I started and currently rocking at 2150
---
Epic....just, epuc.
---
If you want an easy leveling experience play retail.
---
If you want a better social experience play classic.
---
I personally recommend you start with classic.
---
Server caps were a lot smaller than today's servers weren't they?
---
I'm west coast playing on Faerlina (east coast). I'm getting a consistent ping of 60 ms. That's perfectly fine. Like anything below 100 ms is fine for a game like wow, the only issue may be SOMETIMES losing out on tag-offs for named mobs and what not.
---
Yes its worth both your time and $
---
Try “shower” it might be in there.
---
You're not wrong. There were many obvious fixes to this issue that people suggested beforehand. Blizzards lack of opinion on this matter is also pretty annoying. 
---
Something about IT/PC products were we are supposed to be happy about a shitty service..
---
On the method stream they have a thing on the side that shows player levels, but i think it's only people at the method event.

I have 12 hours playtime. I have had no queues to login and have not been disconnected once. Stop trying to create issues that aren’t real

Was disconnected 3 times during my evening gaming session (18:00, 21:00, 00:30) and had to wait for almost an hour first time and 1.5 hours for the second. I planned to spend this time in a game but watched  Asmongold raiding the Deadmines while sitting on the queue.
---
form a group. other people need to kill that mob.
---
Ok ty a lot
---
Don’t ever again truly believe something that was said in General chat mate.
---
????
---
Ok. What happens when the smaller realms die in 3months?
---
no one is nearby lvl 9 no pet
---
&gt;800 people
---
&gt;game dev
---
&gt;millions
---
i appreciate your passion a lot, but that math is not correct.
---
I partially disagree here. 
---
Previous expansion content should be easy, what shouldn’t be happening is each patch introducing a power creep so strong it invalidates the top gear from the last patch.
---
Raiding is also the actual game, and it's more skill dependent than anything in classic. This is coming from someone who loves classic
---
This bullshit,  make an accurate fucking estimate timer !  Moved like 60 ppl in an hour
---
Just made dinner, ate, did dishes, my spot in queue hes only gone down 400 places :(
---
Yup I was 50000 percent wrong lol. I rolled on grob though and have played a solid 15 hours between today and yesterday though.
---
Anyone on the huge super servers i really feel for you
---
&gt;Could just give them a couple days to figure out the best solution to the problem? If you waited all this time for it to come out, you can give it a few more days.
---
Titan was Overwatch, though. It would likely have to be something entirely different
---
Those damn rattlecage skeletons tho...
---
Streamer realms will be the real dead ones in a few months when the new twitch form is out.  Change my mind.
---
If it's wrong by 5 hours, it can hardly be called an estimate. It's just wrong.
---
Just reroll
---
Europeans do love a good queue.
---
I will, just need to wait for a few months when the next wave of servers comes out, I'm bored as fuck already.
---
You can’t. Stop being greedy and let others play the game.
---
I'd say Classic is better for beginners as there are less systems and less content to learn, plus it encourages cooperative gameplay so you'll meet people. However as this is a Classic subreddit I also doubt you'll have anyone tell you Battle for Azeroth is better haha
---
You know, I'd been gone from WoW for so long I'd even forgotten about using macros and how much I missed them.  Cheers.
---
If they were willing to Xfer once, they'll do it again.
---
Theres a blue post saying how it works, basically they have an algorithm and the low Med high rankings are based on relative population colored to the highest. Because there's a few realms with absolutely insane queues, those with 20-25k people, those with 8k queue are considered medium etc etc.
---
Just log off and make room for other players.
---
They aren’t going to code changes to the UI or game *if* they release BC. They’ll release it just as it was in 07.
---
We are at a LAN no way would we leave a man behind in classic.
---
Off should have said if he took that vacation the day of release. How many expansions has wow released now? Outright stupid if you took the actual release day off and a few days following thinking you'd be gaming 100% of that time
---
Not unique to WoW tbh, multiple games have had massive increases over time. What might be unique is it happening on a re release though
---
people arent even logging off this is insane im stuck at 2k in q
---
Earlier b/f switching to my lock I was on my Druid. I was running  down the road and seen a lvl 4 hunter shanking a lvl 6(?) owl. I seen her health was low so I watched to make sure she didn’t die. For extra insurance, i threw a HoT and then a heal and left after she downed it. 
---
Fast forward to my lock.
---
I’m killing some filthy murloc’s for their fins when BAM! 2 more randomly spawn near me! Naturally, I haul Ass. While hauling said ass, a lock and a warrior seen the commotion and tagged the other 2 murlocs to save me from certain death. I agree, I love how people randomly help you out when you’re in danger and I also like to do the helping.
---
Then you gotta wait ingame queue for mob spawns
---
Then don't pollute our subreddit in the mean time.
---
Ten Storms was queue free this evening.
---
no one ever would go by the estimated time... everyone knows it's bugged
---
Yeah sorry, did some research, must be mistaking it for another item
---
You could make an autohotkey script that presses the space bar or random buttons every couple of minutes.
---
thats strange, anytime i dc'ed, i got straight back in without queueing
---
Blizzard said most people would quit in a week, I bet they never expected this to be the reason.
---
Find a partner or group. Wow was meant to be played with people
---
Stat stick with good damage at low levels!
---
I missed the part about them doubling severs, can you send a link? I’d like to stay in the loop.
---
Read this as 'future Soundloud rapper-elf', still fits 😂
---
Its just messy with my loose group of friends.  We had about 8 people do it but half the people are at work when this happens and half already had names reserved/were in game leveling and happy because they hadnt seen the queues yet.
---
It ends up being 1-2 people wanting to move, 1-2 people wanting to stay and the rest not caring yet.
---
Meanwhile if they did this 1 day earlier before anyone was in it would have been easy to convince people to change plans.
---
make it 6 hours tomorrow
---
ahh i see, i can understand a 5 min timer to reconnect to be fair.
---
It is unfortunate :(
---
All of the people I know IRL are on the same specific server.
---
The gap was created so you could pass. How considerate of them! Rememeber to flash your headlights as you drive up into their ass before you pass to say thanks.

Google it
---
This is a super dutch picture. Hertog Jan van de appie
---
I was in queue for almost 7 hours but had to get sleep for work in the morning. Better luck tomorrow
---
Already have a hand on the phone, and snapchat open? Lol
---
same exact problem here. coordinated with 2 currently active guilds + alot of those guild members who have quit in the recent past + friends of all the aforementioned people. it's far too complicated to get all those people to change at this point so for now we grin and bear it
---
Yeah, I also thoght the same, but then I figured it actually says UC (undercity)
---
Amen. The biggest issue with this is the fact that my group almost split between multiple servers, but luckily half the group decided to toss out 4 hours of progress to play with the ones who couldn't get into the server. At my agency, we'd fire the technical director who oversaw a project that went this poorly.
---
Didn't mean that it had been announced. Only that they said that they would try different things including free transfers if necessary and I was implying that it was obviously necessary. Sorry.

---
Play on a different server?
---
Never leave the queue, it's not lying to you. You are as high up the list as you can be at this moment if you're queued.
---
"Blizzard knows more than you" Huh, bullshit.
---
It was definitely the server. With all the crashes layers and “world server is down”
---
You lucky to Even Get in, i logged out yesterday 10:00 and slept to 14:00 and was in queue from 14:00 to 23:00 when i gave up (still at 2000th) this was on firemaw
---
Where was this 'rational' you spoke of?
---
I've tried the twitch client as well, I think i might just be out of luck barring a reinstall of everything
---
Thanks for all of your help!
---
Do you play with the lap top on your lap?
---
If joined queue when i get home, since it'll be about 2 hours. Do I need to be active every now and then in the client or can i just walk away for a few hours and check every now and then? Worried ill get AFK kick from queue.
---
No thank you, I enjoy standing in lines.
---
Getting 40 people was incredibly hard back in the day. MC was *routinely* cleared by casual guilds with 35 people back in vanilla. Now you're talking about a group of players that have made this their professions backed with 13 years of knowledge...
---
Seriously, MC was a joke back then and with 1.12 talents and 16 debuff slots it's going to be even more of a joke now.
---
I listened to Blizzard and played on a new server. I've spent 0 minutes in queue so far.
---
blacksmithing falls off at around 25. Which is why people say to avoid it. It also jacks up the grind SUBSTANTIALLY in the later half of iron and all of mithril.
---
Alchemy on the other hand starts alright and gets ridiculous around 26+. especially for a class like a warrior with zero self heals (being able to run around with a raid's worth of self buffs is also nice to squeeze out a bit of extra power). And the rage potions help combat rage starvation quite well, for times when RNGesus simply isn't with you.
---
The blacksmithing weapons are generally always overshadowed by random drops, quest rewards (not as much pre-20 but almost always post-20), and dungeon rewards, barring a few outliers that have a little bit of longevity at 60 but most are too expensive to be worthwhile.
---
Good thing there are other servers
---
They never should have had so few servers to begin with, even leading up to and performing the name reservations.
---
Everyone in the community knew it was too few, and that it would cause the exact problems that it's causing- why didn't blizzard know that?
---
It is trash because there is nothing to do. All the content there is is meaningless because you might as well just wait for the next raid and try to get better gear there. You might as well just wait for a few weeks or the next patch because your current gear will become meaningless and there will be catch up mechanics for your necklace. There are also not a lot of people who enjoy island expeditions. While 8.2 was a step into the right direction it certainly couldn't save BFA. Yes, it's an opinion but it's a widespread one.
---
If it's crazy in a month maybe but it won't be like this so I don't think so. If you are considering it now's the time to switch.
---
Well, wish them a lot of fun when they are alone at lvl 60 and can't really do much till more arrive there.
---
The best negative buff of all, death.
---
Actually yeah I do, and that never even dawned on me.. Maybe I don't play Ana enough :p
---
Yeah I was told he was in a certain us server and I created an account to test it, didn't work so I assumed he was EU, I could do more research and figure it out but the guys very unknown and it may take a while
---
Blizzard warned everyone multiple times of 10k+ queues.  
---
They did add more servers too late, but that doesn't negate what they warned us will happen.
---
Fill me in please?  I'm unfamiliar with remote access.
---
We have those dudes in the Warhammer community. They’re tools and nobody likes them.
---
where are you getting this info from?
---
STOP RUNNING FROM YOUR HEALER!
---
One thing I find annoying is that you have to get back in the bloody queue if you DC. So I just waited on a 2 hour long queue,played for 30 minutes,DCd and now I'm back in queue. For a server that's not even ''full''.
---
&gt; try to join game, wait for 3 hours in queue
---
&gt; finally make it into the game
---
&gt; play the game for about 1 hour and a half
---
&gt; start enjoying the game
---
&gt; get a random disconnect in the middle of a dungeon 
---
&gt; get back into the queue with 4 hours wait time
---
&gt; rinse and repeat
---
Hoping someone can help... I cant find the classic option on battle.net launcher, I understand it should be a version dropdown on the WOW tab.
---
I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times to no avail. I'm a completely new player to the world of WOW (or at least I would like to be!)
---
r/hydrovillains
---
Hmmm delete the addons folder maybe and make a new one? Sucks. Sorry 💔
---
Nice! TIL the guild I played back in vanilla sucked apparently.
---
 From the AMA
---
Free Realm TransfersWill you offer free realm transfers if servers get way overpopulated after launch?
---
**This is definitely one of the options we are considering. But for now, we are encouraging players to use the name reservation period to transfer their characters to lower population realms.**
---
Paid Character TransferWill PAID transfers also be a thing should a server drop heavily in population and a player wishes to move to find more activity or reconvene with friends on another server.
---
**We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We'll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm. We believe realm identity is an important aspect of Classic so any guidelines around transfers should support this belief.**
---
Where can I find this survey? How's Shazzrah ratio? I know it's just based on reddit and could be totally off.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ZrKehQ_xc
---
Blues clues?
---
I fixed mine by manually configuring the config.wtf
---
I know, it’s not a bad idea, but  many people will reject it. The don’t want any changes, fair enough by me.
---
They had them in vanilla wow though. And I’m already level 20.
---
The queue started with about 100 people logging off every 2 minutes, you mean to tell me starting at 2 literally everyone in the server decided to stop logging, with only one person logging at a pace of 1 per minute? Stay in school
---
I started to chafe after 312 minutes, but momma didn't raise no quitter.
---
I logged in a bit late late last night and didn't play for long, but I had no queue.  I clicked on Whitemane and there were like 4,000 people in the queue.  Players are creating this problem, not Blizzard.
---
Wait till you get about half way through your queue then sweat thinking if you clicked the right sever.
---
My friend literally got a bag each from his first two boar kills in valley of trials last night. 
---
Literally unplayable blizzard please fix.
---
Yes, because I logged in instantly launch day. And just got off work and got put in a queue of 350. There are Servers with little to no wait.
---
I've been stuck at position 145 for like an hour. Now it keeps bouncing from 141 to 142 and back. Definitely something wierd happening.
---
All I know is that it shows the ding animation on the screenshot. So it is timed as you're asking.
---
Because there are queue times? Yeah welcome to vanilla. You’ll thank them for no dead servers in 6 months.
---
So are you Azzip or Pizza?  Cause one of you posted this hours ago.
---
I would say this is sound advice but if you can get a solid upgrade from it, I can wait
---
Or any MMO expansion launch in general
---
this is the equivalent of people saying "first" in a youtube video......
---
I thought the mana skill was good, leveling enhancement
---
Sunk cost fallacy. You'll make up the leveling by not sitting in queue in no time.
---
I have a whole bar devoted to lower ranks of Mark. The lowest you need is 2.
---
I can afford it. Apparently you can't read. Keep sucking that blizzard dick.
---
Yeah, if you want to be able to play the game consistently don't play on Faerlina. The queues are not only very busy, but very slow moving. I also can't even tell if they are bugging out for me cause it is just bouncing back and forth between 80 and 81 for my position.
---
But yeah, there never isn't a queue in Faerlina. Absolute dead hours last night into this morning had a queue of 4-8k. Now and through the night they'll be anywhere from 11k-~20k. If you want to play you need to plan out when you join the queue very precisely, so it is ready when you want to play.
---
Meh. If you wanted complex and engaging boss fights then FFXIV is light years ahead.
---
Only we know how it feels. (dcd as well)
---
Blizzard should add more servers and allow some migration.
---
 They know based on name reservation and people trying to play that their conservative number of servers was never gonna cut it.
---
Dissapoint first make people quit and then turn out it's the correct amount of servers? Profit for them, we are more or less the victims of marketing rather than being a full consumer.
---
It's laughable to think blizzard is trying their best already so far.
---
If you and people like you go there, it won't be low pop anymore. If you build it, they will come. Unless they're too scared and sit in queue instead.
---
Every single EU PvP server has long ass queues. Go fuck yourself, this isn't some issue of people refusing to move, THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO.
---
I’ll be doing this tomorrow, god bless team viewer! For some reason they think I’m using it on a professional capacity, if only they knew....
---
Depends if you ever want to go into Alchemy.  
---
If not, Tailoring/Skinning isn't bad option. But leather will be flooding the market.
---
Finally got on Gandling and played 15 minutes before going to bed! Almost reached level 3, had a short but great time!
---
Say that to the warlock who gets free mount
---
I work. I WILL NOT be able to play for at least two weeks then. I figured there would be a queue but literally all afternoon is a bit much.
---
Druid is middle of the pack almost always with whatever spec you're playing in :) Just jump online, make your druid and enjoy the game. Play it how you want because that's what's going to make it more enjoyable for you. I think the reason why a lot of people (myself included) were so excited about classic coming out was that it gave us a breath of fresh air. Being able to get online for the joy of it not because it felt more like a chore. 
---
Play how you want to play, Enjoy :)
---
You were warned though, that’s why they opened new servers.
---
Who cares?
---
And why wouldn’t someone want a straight-forward answer when it has to do with the investment of a large amount of their time/life?
---
Oceania had 1 pvp server before launch. They added 3 more after launch. Wtf was i supposed to do once I'd started on a server and all of my friends were on there
---
Classic good retail bad
---
Look at Mr Fancyboy here wearing rings already. La-di-dah.
---
Stay prot and carry flag
---
&gt;female NE hunter
---
BIG yikes
---
There's internet in the airplane?
---
DEATH DENIED!
---
I think ive read somewhere that account sharing isnt against the ToS. That blizzard just advises not to for security reasons. Not dure how accurate it is
---
Shit
---
Complain to blizzard? Ask for some credit to your sub
---
if its his wife?  no
---
wtf is wrong with you
---
Yeah. I talked to my wife, 3 RL buddies, 4 guildies from my original classic guild, 6 guildies from the guild I raided ~ulduar through cataclysm with, 3 people I played path of exile with, and 3 people I played BfA with. My wife's friend from work is going to join us and many of those other numbers have, you know, their brothers/sisters/SOs/friends playing too. 
---
All of a sudden, we're looking at 50 people that need convinced to switch servers and I'm an adult with a job. I don't want to be a leader/coordinator. I just wanted to play a few hours here and there with some old friends and was happy to follow whatever seemed fine a couple days ago (which was a medium pop server at the time), as well as communicate our intentions with anyone else who happened to msg me and ask if I was planning on playing.
---
BGs aren't going to be in the game for a long time. WSG comes out in phase 3 and AB comes out even later. I love twinks but its a little early to be worrying out that haha. You do you though man, good luck!
---
As an IT expert, I do sympathize, and I share some of the same feelings. That said, server and network infrastructure is...interesting; it's not just capacity for numbers, load peaks can do interesting things. To be clear, I'm not justifying them, they did fuck this up pretty bad IMHO. There's only so much one can do to prepare for estimated numbers, which is understandable, but they lowballed expected load harder than a teenager looking at a warm apple pie.  
---
But, on the other hand...I played original vanilla, from launch, all the way through WOTLK steady. Especially in the earlier vanilla days, it was a basic fact that on patch days, and on expansion launches, that day (or couple, in the case of expansion), things'd be unstable for a bit. Largely, it was known by those that could get in and were stable, they were lucky, and for the rest, it was the understood price of attempting immediate access.   
---
With no wish to be insulting, it was simply a patience thing; that said, you are very right to be frustrated. But, the most helpful advice I can give, as someone who's danced this dance many times before, is don't take vacation days right at launch. Take it the week after, or 2-3 days at the minimum.
---
Okay, thank you very much for the fast reply! :)
---
I would like the yellow ? And ! On the minimap, but I know a lot of people wouldn't so I'm not going around asking for it... I know a lot of yal look at that the same way I look at the stupid giant blue circle telling me exactly where to go.
---
Yeah I found the poll. It kinda scares me as I play alliance on Shazzrah and I would like to actually enjoy the game and it not turning into horde domination. It's bad for both sides as eventually they'll be no PVP for either side.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/244480
---
Do you already have a retail WoW license attached to your account?
---
If you ever want to raid MC onwards, you'll want that dark iron gear! A crazy grind, but it'll make all the difference if you intend to tank it.
---
\&gt; I have no one to interact with
---
Maybe that's a problem you're creating yourself. Take a couple of breaths and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Oof
---
Honestly, I think they're being slow to release servers on the off-chance that the popularity fizzles out over the next week or so.
---
They don't want 100 low-pop servers that feel empty.
---
Honestly, they should just make transfers open/free for the first few months, and keep steadily adding servers.
---
Yeah, there was a blizz post about it somewhere. They said they arent happy with how it is working right now with some servers having 20k queues making a 2k queue a low pop. But it isnt a priority to fix the algorithm right now
---
Downstairs area is exact same in one of horde quest houses is this pretty common?
---
There are servers without Queues. People just refuse to play them. (for NA anyways)
---
We are all excited for you to quit
---
Lucky you, I’m still waiting for a reply to my ticket more than 24 hours later. 
---
Can’t even call them or live chat them because the options are greyed out
---
This is something I think Ion overlooks when he says "people are going to login, see 15k queues and pick another server".  He's thinking of people as machines.
---
What headache?
---
This sub?
---
And what action does Blizzard need to take?
---
navy seals only get like five hours of sleep total during hell week
---
It's fun to show someone how much they spend on junk and eating out. It's usually in the 1000$ range and then they go and say things like 200$ / mo? Lolnah
---
15033 for me as of now.
---
LISTEN TO YOURSELF. 13 Hours isn't a significant time investment??? What the fuck are you talking about? You've probably never worked a 13 hour shift in your life...........
---
This has added much needed introspective to the onslaught of people posting the same exact thing. Thank you for your contribution.
---
[this guy is lv35 right now](https://www.twitch.tv/journeywow)
---
yeah i’m starting a new char tomorrow, prolly joining a low pop server
---
I mean they do. Blizzard has been warning us that there are going to be long load times at first for a little while now. Is it really more likely that us random redditors know more about running mmo servers than blizzard does?
---
How do you know? I watched and it looked legit when he was talking and answering questions and talked about his guid beeing down?
---
Most people here played 15 years ago... that's 15 years worth of career advancement. That amount of money doesnt bother me as long as I'm having fun. And that looks like fun
---
Do you have an account?
---
Good argument.
---
Lolllll I had a feeling this would happened so I resumed the night before
---
Fuuuuuuu wtb some in central Alabama. Looks so crushable. Also WOW reference makes it better.
---
Your guild shouldn't have chose Faerlina.
---
Yea. Just xfer your guild and friends you already leveled and played with. All you people complaining about classic community's sure don't mind being shit on by bad business practices.
---
I can only play in the evening. And I go to bed at midnight at the latest. Ive been playing 6 hour total. And sitting in queue while doing stuff irl  for like  12 hours since yesterday.
---
Really they should just let us play retail while in line.
---
&gt;(✿ =‿‿=)
---
warrior is the only melee dps/tank class in the game :)
---
Or. Get skinning.
---
It's cool, you will as well in a few months when the wow factor wears off and you realize this version is totally gutted.
---
&gt;I have a Vive
---
That's your problem, the actually good VR experiences (stuff like Lone Echo, Blood and Truth, AstroBot, untethered Superhot...) are on Oculus/PSVR.
---
As much as I hate Facebook, so far they're the only ones that are willing to invest the big bucks that VR will needs for taking off, just look at what they're now achieving with Quest.
---
only 90 minutes :D
---
jk more like 900minutes
---
came out on today. Not my favorite of the serie tho :(
---
Dont go afk
---
Then enjoy the queue my guy
---
Theres no confirmation transfers are in phase 2.  Going by vanilla, they were much later than that, the equivalent of phase 4 or 5 content in classic.  They haven't even confirmed it'll be an option (for paid transfers).
---
I've played the BC launch on the second most populated server of my region. It was laggy as fuck for the first 10 hours with a bunch of server crashes. But at least I got to play.
---
Early enough that when I checked his stream at 3am he was still only at 10k in the queue
---
Please off every jaywalker on the planet.
---
I asked in the chat of the troll starting area if there is anything worthwhile for doing the quests there besides the exp. For some reason people laughtet at me. 
---
Well, I then went and leveled somewhere else, probably a higher level by then than the people who were waiting in queue for that scorpion.
---
Worked for a ton of us last night, I guess we have better people on our server than yours.
---
You're supposed to have a grace period to bypass the queue but it seems to fail if you disconnect due to some part of the realm shitting itself.
---
It does sometimes work and every time I logged out manually I could just pop back in instantly.
---
Earthshock!
---
They said that they were going to to sharding on release to avoid this... which is a really fucking good idea.
---
I did this and my queue just randomly stopped for some reason when I had 30m to go, I remoted in to check on it and it was just sitting at blank login screen after being in queue for 5 hours all day...
---
Yep, that's why I hopped off at the last second. I want a shit ton of wpvp and active Horde + Alliance.
---
This.  And even worse if your playing as a grp of friends.  Because no way the lords of rng and blizz's servers are gonna allow all 5 of you online at once without kicking at least one of you...
---
Yep, I think they took too long to release new servers. People dug in on the servers that were released. Maybe the really long queues will get some to move.
---
You know, put up some kind of announcement saying "Hey guys, if it says 'Full' you will have a long queue, go somewhere else."
---
Wait until they stop adding new servers and then pick the newest one
---
I wouldn’t pick that server imo. People are free to complain but some servers were not a good choice from the start.
---
No need to attack the rest of us like that.
---

Makes sense. Im running aura durations and wasnt seeing those.
---
Hes spending the same amount of time as anyone else... just his brain and wallet are so much bigger
---
I got 4 blue bags in like 1h playtime. Is this luck or common? Im new to wow.
---
I guess when dire maul came out as to differentiate both.
---
Yes it is. If you join a group you can notice the switch if you were on different layers
---
oof
---
Sounds like an addon
---
Raiding is the actual game in retail for sure.  The world is mostly dead and essentially just a lobby you sit in waiting for whatever queue you're in to finish.  In some ways it's closer to Diablo than the original WoW.  Classic is much more about community and interacting with the world.  Raiding is just a part of that.
---
I got in on lunch break at noon. Started my queue to get back in at 1... sigh.
---
It's now medium with a 3,000 queue.
---
yeah all my friends and I joined Yojamba, leveled to 10 last night together, it was awesome :)
---
so far Yojamba has been very close to how it was in retail.
---
Alliance Kromcrush here.
---
I saw in the Gen chat of my server that people used to call DM "VC" to stand for VanCleef. i think it was used to differentiate Deadmines from Dire Maul. both being shortened to "DM" could be more confusing to find groups in a chat where you're level/context cant be seen easily. makes sense to me yes
---
From what I've gathered professions in classic matters alot, and I wouldn't want to go with the "wrong" option. Does professions based on class vary? I'm most likely going to play a mage, because I heard they are great for solo leveling. From what I've seen from the proffessions, enchanting and engineering seems like "the best", just from what ive gathered, although they look very advanced, but I dont have a clue tbh. Professions like mining, alchemy and tailoring seems very easy to do, but what you make from these professions I assume you can just buy on the market, but maybe it's worth going for these, I honestly don't know. If you've read this far, what do you suggest a solo first time player should for their professions?
---
This was just around launch, so guess he was queuing like everyone else
---
Somehow most of the streamers are able to stay in 24/7
---
Enter womb
---
You know why it'll be fine in a week?  Because people will leave because they can't play.  They arn't in there making connections with other players to keep them around.  At some point the balance shifts from "we need full servers to keep people interested" to "we are leaving money on the table because people can't get in".
---
I use a fan that oscillates over the keyboard. When it goes right it brushes down the jump button.
---
imagine, if in someway, multiple people are able to get dc'd at once
---
I have a tall ikea dresser (5 shelves in height).  External keyboard &amp; mouse sit on top, along with a mini laptop shelf. On top of that is a laptop stand, inclined for ventilation. 
---
Playing while standing is great, and the angles line up so there’s no neck or wrist pain.
---
Which does not help anyone if they have already sunk a full day of gameplay into a character, based on early name reservation (a Blizzard invention).  So this is irrelevant.
---
Wasn’t a few hours and wasn’t 10 levels. And that’s what alts are for... not repeating the same content in a days time. Density in that post.
---
Happiness is a state of mind that constantly eludes me.
---
And here I thought I was the only one with this problem
---
Thanks. Will look into this quality of life improvement.
---
Reading a quest text is hard.
---
&gt;o need you to
---
How would you imaging proving someones intent ? I'm just saying that mass purges complete the task of rotating players. And there is no other reason for this purges. Maybe someone who has in-depth knowledge of the server side can say what is the reason for discontenting many players.
---
What’s the lowest population PvP East server? Not currently tied to any particular server and want to avoid queues as much as possible as I can only play during peak hours (6-9 pm EST).
---
Hard question but do you have an idea of when that'll be?
---
That’s why blizzard doing this because y’all gonna be dumb and give them money for something they made up you think this server issues aren’t their own fault for some shady reason
---
Can't wait to sit here for another 6 hours in queue to get my 1 hour of playtime before I have to go to sleep.
---
Organic botting??
---
This.  And it’s frustrating.  I grew up with computers in the late 80s and early 90s and loved tinkering and fixing issues and accidentally ruining everything and having to reformat.  
---
I have no idea how to even start tinkering with my iPhone. Now things are designed so it’s impossible to look under the hood, so people don’t.
---
Sociopaths
---
Lmao mine says 1499 with a 1min wait .....
---
Gankalot :D
---
lmao I did not realize this would be so funny. I just graduated from college and currently job searching on the side of all of this. Once I get a job I can play, but probably not much. This made my day, thanks.
---
The lightning looks so smooth and alive... is this a feature of geforce 2080?
---
PSA... REALLY?
---
I aren't able to biff being a warrior, but if I see someone whose running away from a mob I'll charge and hamstring the fucker to help them escape.
---
the best part about healing vs helping kill is that you don't penalize their xp. So they don't act like a salty douche afterward because you dropped their xp/hour by 0.07% by knocking off 30% of the enemy's HP.
---
I mean it's definitely wrong. I jumped from over 4k to #3 literally instantly, and I've been stuck at #3 (Not 3k) for 30 minutes minutes. Im gonna just wait though.
---
I'm on Deviate; seems to be steadily growing on Horde side, and the community is friendly.
---
Dammmmmmnnnnnnnnn
---
Go ahead and criticise, but you're a sad little hypocrite if you're half as angry as you sound but keep giving them money.
---
But I guess I've just got Blizzard's dick in my mouth for suggesting people chill out a little bit.  For someone so aggressive, you sure are defensive when you get called out.
---
Peach. I am grouping up and whoever refuses will have only themselves to blame. Good luck beating my 10ms autoclick macro.
---
Then join a different server. It's been a day, you aren't losing any major progress. You're bitching about a problem caused by your own stubbornness.
---
You've "invested" five hours, what a joke
---
Well I've been at 98 &lt;1min for 20 minutes
---
Even restarted my computer thinking the game crashed or something. Booted back up, jumped right back to 98, 97
---
I'm practically 1/8th gay
---
They put up a bunch of new servers. I can understand people not wanting to leave character names or a guild. But I'd be having some discussions with the guild. I mean, what if it doesn't really go down for a long time. 4 hours a night waiting? For weeks? No thanks.
---
It's a tough choice, but could also be an easy one. Even low pop servers are full of people. They just don't have multiple layers going. I'm on low pop and there are people everywhere.
---
That’s hardly the point lol
---
Not at 8am but right before the restart it was at 2k lol
---
lol np
---
Because their algorithm is skewed by servers like Herod and Whitemane. The realm population you see is relative to the other servers. So the medium pop realm is still full. It just shows as medium because there are a couple top heavy servers shifting things.
---
They’ve said they’re going to look into ways to fix that, but it’ll be after the craziness of launch is over.
---
The estimated times have been far from accurate.
---
Great original post
---
Whatever it takes lol
---
Big brain move is to go in queue and go to sleep. You can check the queue when you wake up after around 7h. Then have a nice long breakfast and coffee.
---
I haven’t had a queue since last night
---
Good lord listen to yourself versus all the purests a month ago. Can't have it both ways man.
---
Hi, /u/DoctorLoomis48

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwbh1g/que_goes_from_3369_to_373_in_5_minutes_now_its/). 
---
Oh yes it is. Anti-AFK macros/"machines" that keep people from getting logged out even while they're asleep
---
Can dwarves mount on the night elf tigers? I'm considering questing in the night elf zones to get the rep there for the mount, if i can ride it as a dwarf, that is.
---
Been in queue in stalagg for 4 and hour hours started at 10k now at 950. But in the last hour i only dropped 50. No one is getting off anymore atleast in stalagg.
---
Or another keyboard button for those of us without a gamer mouse.
---
i did this but then the guild changed servers because everyone else didn't which meant i was fucked and had to start over
---
Never had a queue on Smolderweb and I've logged in at three different times throughout the day so far
---
How the fuck does a public humiliation of someone based purely on their physical appearance stay on this sub for 7 hours?
---
Just because Hotted streams I assume.
---
What a fucking joke this subreddits mods are.
---
I understand. It's mostly catharsis, with a small amount of hope that someone over there will read it.
---
This kid was raiding AQ/Naxx pre-K ... and probably better than some of the dead weight we dragged thru trying to fill 40 man.
---
I think the game kept its core identity through wrath of the pitch king.  I’d like to see them introduce the expansions very slowly over time. 
---
Additionally as the servers begin to lose population they need to do a server merge sooner than later.  If during peek hours servers are on low population they should seriously consider merging with another low population server.  
---
Finally, before any expansion or merges they should consider (if possible) bring the guild banks back.  
---
Those are my thoughts.
---
Same.. but two hours for medium pop
---
I am perfectly healthy.
---
You are perfectly healthy, but you have a zit on your face.
---
Between the two of us, you are relatively dead.
---
In normal conversation, using words in a way that "technically" makes sense if you completely remove them from their meaning is retarded.
---
There are no "open" servers, there are no "empty" servers. The gameplay experience is equally horrid on all of them, the only difference being, you have to wait for your awful experience on many of them. Bearing in mind that *each server is currently holding 3 servers' worth of people* and separating them by sharding, yeah, we need more servers.
---
I feel like this is going to continue for a while.. shouldn't blizz offer free transfers to the newer realms?
---
I have a 1080ti and it looks just as good. Perhaps you need a better monitor? I’m using a 4K tv
---
On EU atm
---
I've been in Thunder Bluff for about 30 mins total and I've hated this trade chat for every single second of it. I'm being unreasonably salty, but why the fuck can't german players play on german servers where they can speak german for example?
---
I can understand spanish and nordic and whatnot, as I'm norwegian myself, but still keep the 'global' chats english fuck man
---
/rant over
---
It was crowded last night for sure. There was a queue but nothing like the main ones. I was queuing for stalag for like 2 hours then decided to switch. Queued Krom for about 45 min, got in, never DC’d.
---
Shows medium right now but still about a 3k queue.
---
Asmond has 150k followers. How many people does a server hold? Even if 10% played on one server from one streamers that's 15k. Seriously messed up.
---
I think WoD is what officially killed it for me. I maintained an extremely casual Cata character but I pretty much immediately dropped off after capping in WoD. It just felt soulless.
---
I’ve been prancing around Teldrassil picking flowers and it’s everything I hoped it would be.
---
It's sillier that people expected to get onto the big servers that blizzard literally said "Hey. We made more servers. Maybe try these?" And then they didn't and still made plans around being able to play. I've logged onto classic twice now on grobbulus. Second time 10 min queue time. First time no queue
---
Aside from things that minor there isn't much else. And if you do something like that it opens the door to other change which can enrage people quickly.
---
My god you have no clue how this works.
---
could be just their streaming software making it look nicer
---
yeah, razorgore for example 10k queue, waiting for almost 3 hours now. got dcd =/
---
Pop will drop for sure, but he said the servers will be deserted when the dust settled.
---
Frustrating to have the count go from 5000 to 800 in a couple of hour to having it move down to 640 in another two hours.  I guess I’ll have to wait a few weeks until all the important people have stopped playing.
---
This is phenomenal
---
I would also be interested in knowing about Chinese players. I have to imagine there are some that are going quite hard.
---
ITS JUST LIKE DISNEY WORLD
---
Finally, quality content
---
Could easily be solved by allowing free server transfers and removing the unique name limitation.
---
Amazon with way more people.
---
Horde side I've seen a ton of mages and rogues, after that probably warriors and shamans. I'm not complaining though, gimme that priest gear.
---
Yup I did the same thing. Group of about 9 of us moved from Herod to Stalagg to Skeram to Incendius. Not really sure what else we could have done to avoid this
---
I don't have a number, but 5+ hours
---
Yep...I'm waiting with 10k in front of me after a random dc 3 hours ago.  Feels bad
---
Check out Leatrix Plus, it auto accepts/turns in quests for you and auto vendors/repairs if you really want to be efficient.
---
When will people be able to log in reliably without queues?
---
Are you on Blaumeux by chance? How long is the queue right now? Off work in 45 mins and can't check.
---
On Incidedous which was a small realm like 2 days ago.
---
Enlighten me then you fucking kiddy fiddler
---
Anybody elses' queue hardly moving? Mine has said estimated time 54 minutes for about 30 minutes now, and have only gone down like 200 (3800 -&gt; 3600) in that time
---
he was probably a warlock...or a shaman...seeing how orcs can't be mages in classic.
---
shut uuuuuuup DONT TELL THEM
---
I'm not saying it's a good troll job but it's a troll job. hey I get it, those are my only options but if you want to poke fun at me I get to poke fun back.
---
Fucking genius bro
---
I'm so sorry... you should've taken work off so you could atleast play.. my que is 9k....
---
Damn, that hurts dude. My condolences.
---
It’ll take longer than that, it slows down as you get closer
---
That's why you change your VPN every once in awhile to make the sale look more natural when it happens.
---
If the misspelling is more common dosn't that make it the correct spelling?  ;)  I mean webster be damned.   hehe
---
It's ok I literally havent gotten past the queue boss. Hang in there friend
---
Thumb buttons are pretty basic nowadays. Very useful for office work, editing etc.
---
I don't think a lot of us knew that 'pure classic experience' meant they were going to use the servers from 2002 as well.
---
Well honestly, a true vanilla experience would be just that... People trying to tag MoBs before anyone else can. Then /lol at the ones who tried and failed. Real vanilla was like being raised in the ghetto. Lol.
---
Okay but that has nothing to do with layering. Blizzard definitely messed up by opening too few servers, I think we had 5 PvP NA servers at first. Everyone knows this was a mistake. But for layering/queues/population, there does not exist a better solution.
---
I will say they could help by opening transfers **right now** FROM super high pop servers TO super low pop servers. People don't want to abandon their characters even if they're only level 5.
---
you lucky sob. 
---
I am almost 9 and haven't gotten any.
---

---
Not sure that's possible. But my fan also brushes the wasd keys along with keyboard just to be safe. Jump should be sufficient.
---
Probably pretty close
---
WoW Classic General Discussion non accessible anymore on US forums? It was fine yesterday, and right now the menu has disappeared for me from the home page, I tried accessing with a direct link and got the error "access denied".
---
On EU forums it's fine instead. Anyone else has the same problem?
---
Wtf razorgore had no que last night when firemaw had 13k
---
Every server was high population you ignorant potato. Go back to eating crayons.
---
Release for WoD maybe just the server I was on but it was close to 4 hours and had to of course wait to kill stuff just like now in classic. I see very few differences with old launches.
---
Did that several times with my Shaman. I was wondering why my heals sucked.. :D
---
How am i able to see it in stream then
---
Damn.  Joined queue @ 3:30PM EST for Incendius.  Still 40 mins to go!
---
You’re not playing today dude
---
Best feeling ever!
---
exactly Blizzard being their own worst enemy here. Much fewer people will quit because of server mergers than because of queue. They are severely hamstringing classic right now, I hope it's recoverable but the situation has to drastically improve in the next couple of days
---
Oh yeah. I had to camp the same two boars for all 10 kills in the first quest. I found a good spot between two rocks, where people didn't go lol.
---
People who played Classic WoW in 2006 are fully grown adults now. How do you guys still manage to have the time to play full-time like a job? That makes absolutely no sense.
---
Once all the joke retail players who are going to play to 35 and quit go back to farming mounts the queues should stabilize.
---
I thought they announced the layering was going to be removed in phase 2 which would make it simultaneous for all servers
---
Jesus... Pagle is literally medium pop rn and I'm going UP in que?? I love paying a sub/6months game time to fucking wait in a que to bug out and shit.
---
...and we've come full circle.
---
They cannot increase server sizes.
---
If they increased server sizes, Blizzard wouldn't be able to remove layering without gigantic queues down the road.
---
It is not about capability. It is about managing population.
---
How do you still not understand this?
---
Last night, in Dun Morough, we all lined up single file to collect Felix(?)'s box. I told everyone lining up I'd give them stam for doing it. Felt awesome. Went oom very fast.
---
yes, spanish server now. We are also paying customers who deserve our server
---
I'd personally recommend questie if it's a problem for you, (though trust me you still want to read the quest text if you have it installed)
---
I joined at 415 for stalagg, been at 180 minutes for 2+hours
---
Getting punished for working a 9-5 job totally sucks. These queues are ridiculous.
---
The fuck
---
I regret taking 4 hour nap since now I have a 4 hour Q.
---
The price of not wanting to be on a dead server in two weeks....
---
Is playing for a second day really the definition of "profound and determined interest?
---
I'm probably just gonna try again in a few days, it is currently more hassle than enjoyment atm
---
This is why myself and one of my friends did - we were going to play on Whitemane with our guildies from retail but as soon as I saw 25k in queue I knew it was going to be more than a launch day problem and we rolled Smolderweb right when it open. Actually got to play and had a hell of a time while half our guild was chatting in discord and updating everyone every 5-10 minutes that they were another 20-30 people closer and only thousands away. Most of them didn't even play before calling it. It sucks and I get wanting to stay with your core group but I'd rather play the game than not. If the queues stay nuts I'll probably just full-commit to this server and eventually just server transfer at endgame if truly necessary.
---
Osrs good, rs3 bad
---
Haha so far so good! Was in queue to Fairbanks since like noon PST, and got like an hour and a half ago. Had some hicups with graphics card, but was able to quit game and come back in no probs!
---
&gt; seem to have a profound and determined interest in this game
---
Noone can know after only 2 days, give it at least 2 weeks.
---
Good luck getting through the queue
---
Logged in multiple times yesterday and today, never had to face a queue. Am playing on the US realm and had no lag so far - and I ain't even from the US. Some waited hours to play, sure, but many tens of thousands others enjoyed the game right after launch.
---
You are all just butthurt because of expected queues and disconnects. They did their job, kept adding a bunch of functional servers. Only a brainlet would expect 100% uptime for everyone at a launch of this fucking scale.
---
Because they’re streaming their own image...?
---
Ive never enjoyed raiding
---
Sorry i only use reddit on my phone. And it was easier to take a picture fast with it than send one over #sorryforquality
---
Mine has said that for over an hour and a half. I canceled my sub. We have no grounds for refunds.  I paid 2 weeks early to get my name. Was forced off Herod and lost my names. Jumped to stalagg...  lost my names jumping to bigglesworth at last minute due to blue post... and I still cant play. 
---
I'll come back. I enjoy classic. But man I just feel beat up.
---
6744.... Cute
---
*don'tn't
---
Pagle!
---
Congrats on not playing dummy
---
Maybe you need to find the definition of estimate.
---
Get sweetfx or some other shader software. I think it's allowed so your can go wild.
---
Yeah, I rolled on a lower-pop server. If/when queues drop on higher-pop ones, I might reroll there. Better to have a week of playing than a week of waiting in queues for most of my play time.
---
Firemaw EU we had a 30k long lol
---
In other words: 
---
"What I'm saying is not true, but I'm going to say it is anyway and continue peddling this false narrative."
---
I’m just an aggressive dick online because in my personal life I’m super passive. It’s the only way I get any frustration out. Probably unhealthy so sue me.
---
🧐
---
My guy, if you have friends on that server, and don't want to switch you only got 2 options: a) get salty or b) sit back, relax, and enjoy the queue my guy.
---
Yea mine to, but we never know!
---
Yeah I do t think you’re gonna find a PVP server without a queue.
---
At least this one is manageable so far, but I think it will stack up as you said.
---
It's a bit janky
---
It sucks because everyone got in without a wait besides me, but I work in the city so I have to sit in traffic to get home...now I'm going to fall behind.  Imagine if this continues for a while?  What a nightmare it would be, friends sitting at 60, I'm still at 40 dealing with queue times.
---
Okay, this might be dumb, but is there somewhere on reddit that is recruiting guilds for WoW Classic?
---
Okay but if 2 of his mages are playing at the same time and doing different things
---
It used to be if you didnt have any toons on a server that was locked you couldnt make them on it back in wotlk iirc
---
I feel like I'm being "that guy" but I will fight with claw and teeth
---
Is it really against ToS? Is it easy to find?
---
And if so do I just right click and report for Language?
---
As keen as I am for classic, I won't judge until its had a few months. OSRS has succeeded due to a combination of the returning community, voting system and continued development. Sure classic is reeling in subscribers now for it's launch, but plenty of other MMOs have done so and died a quick death.
---
I'm hoping that BestBuff will work. Downrakes the buff for their level. When I'm running by and it says they are too low level they will be gone by the time I pull out my spell book.
---
I've been doing the same shit. i got in game 10 minutes before i got home from work yesterday while some of my friends waited till almost midnight to play.
---
I agree with you on keeping servers full for the long term, my only issues doesn't lie in the ques but in the disconnections every hour and having to re que. Can't they do a grace period to allow for 60 second of re logging in without waiting
---
That's true.  15 years went in the blink of an eye....then 3 years.  Damn us fly by nighters.
---
Joining tomorrow rolling priest. Have played tons before and left for a bit so if anyone is also starting tomorrow and wants to level with a healer help let me know. Not sure on server yet. But I always played healer so I know what's up
---
Having people's friends not even be able to see the realm their friend told them to roll on is a great way to lose subscriptions.
---
Yeah. I'ts like High, Super Stacked, Unplayable without whole day planned around it.
---
Instructions unclear, went from 220 mins to 400 mins left to long in.
---
just seeing how many people are in a starting zone i amazing.
---
I’m currently playing it on my 2018 MacBook Air it runs smoothly with no heat issues at all
---
But I am?
---
Was 6k about 10 minutes ago. I'm sure it's higher now.
---
I've been in queue for whitemane for about 3.5 hours, and I'm only 2k in line now.
---
But my Monitor would make it look bad if it was the Cause.
---
4:20
---
Not able to play tonight unfortunately hence making this list!
---
Reminds me of the general chat in Darnassus on Faerlina. "No talking about Trump, it's 2004 and George Bush is our president."
---
About 20-30 min
---
/r/classicwow: "I can't wait to spend the next 6 months getting to level 60!  It's about the journey - earning things, long-term commitment, and fun!"
---
Also /r/classicwow: "If I can't immediately login and have fun during the first 24 hours the game is available, the entire launch is a failure and Blizzard are morons."
---
Joana has no shot at world first. He’s going for lowest played time. Account sharers are only ones who can try for world first.
---
ShareX is all u need
---
Try smolderweb, its going to fill up soon.
---
Need buff, what server u on?
---
Because tv is aids to use
---
Woodcutting levels?
---
Worked perfectly. Thank you!
---
For 2 days even? Game is out for 24 hours.
---
Normally you do. But it's not working with the kolkar booty key
---
I just sat in a queue to login to Gehennas for close to 7 hours, with 5 minutes remaining I received a "disconnected from server" error.
---
Really.
---
Same boat, my dude. 11k queue by the time I got home yesterday, dropped outta queue 6 hours in cause I had to sleep. Checking wowhead now for queue times, cause I'm off in 30 mins. 
---
Already at 8k. No way office workers get to play this till this weekend. It's the worse.
---
Been sitting at 5k for the last 20 minutes.
---
Patiently waiting by 50 cent came on while I was in queue last night, it got stuck in my head
---
Respect the hustle
---
Kirtonos Med pop low to no que PVP eastern
---
Levels weapon skills faster, still useful
---
Don’t use the tuk app.
---
That’s just not true man. Your monitor can play animated CGI movies, but that doesn’t mean your computer is capable of generating/rendering said cgi. See what I’m saying?
---
I have that mouse.
---
I use scroll wheel in Diablo 2 to move.
---
Back when I played retail I used to use scroll wheel to list all my auctions with the TSM add on
---
Played until 5 and hit 13! Luckily I didn’t have work until 3 pm.. now I’m at work ready to go all night again.
---
Wait a week or two.
---
Unless you are a hunter.
---
Just tried this, looks like it worked! Thank you!
---
Nice this exact same post again. How clever
---
or option D. 
---
Bitch on reddit until blizz caves and ups the server limits
---
I'm totally with you, wasn't too bad on my realm, but if it gets worse I'll start reporting people.
---
It's that easy lol.
---
Yeah, it'll be much better soon. Everyone's just so excited!
---
This morning I got on no queue and everything was perfect. I should have just stayed up... (I work nights)
---
Who said anything about free game time lol.. man u are projecting hardcore. Get real xD
---
Auto run?
---
Classic doesn’t require any purchases box/game. Just the subscription.
---
I couldn’t make it to 10. So close! 9 1/3.
---
It was more of a matter of failing to add it back in when the zones were remade. People in this thread are just making up their own fake reasons just for an excuse to be mad at someone. Same goes for darker nights.
---
ALL addons that use the ingame LUA API are allowed. If blizzard doesn't like an addon they will just change the API to stop it from working.
---
Waiting in a virtual line is not experiencing the game. Blizzard fucked up big time.
---
The primary issue was opening the character reservation shit with only like 2-3 servers per region *even while having additional servers planned before doing so.*
---
What an idiotic and arbitrary way to launch.
---
Well maybe I'll see you soon then! 
---
Neutralnpc on alliance side :)
---
Most likely. But this isnt like original classic where blizz is actually paying people to police and give a shit about their game imo. I'm gonna roll the dice. I would certainly expect any kind of ban to be temporary
---
I logged yesterday right when servers went live, thalnos, and waited 5 hours to get in. Shit was tight af
---
Used TeamViewer today to start wow on my desktop an hour before I got home from work, worked a treat
---
Journey just hit lvl 36 [journeywow](https://www.twitch.tv/journeywow)

---
I’m gonna upvote this because it’s not complaining about queue and I’m just excited to see someone having fun browsing Reddit
---
&gt;Also, from Blizz yesterday: "One of the things we've been trying to message very proactively is there are no low population servers currently. There are no underpopulated servers currently. There are healthy servers, jam packed servers and just insanely overcrowded, unplayably overcrowded servers, and that's the range of options to choose among."
---
I tried, I don't care what server on. Just time zone. Every single Pacific coast server had a 20k lineup
---
It's so much better then on live coz buffs are actually useful.
---
lol calling me out, big tough guy defending his masta . Well boot licker opinions are invalid too so here we are.
---
Druids in the NE starting zone cannot relate. There isn't any non-buffed player who to buff.
---
Mines showing 6 hours wait right now...
---
12 hours seems right.
---
Maybe I can play in a few months I guess. :(
---
It’s not really about blizzard not being prepared, they’ve just said they aren’t gonna be increasing the realm cap further, since that would make the realms too big to remove layering. The weird thing is people choosing to play on the extremely populated servers.
---
Ya, havn't tried sending something...but noticed the realm tag on names too.  It wouldn't shock me, worth trying at least.
---
Those bastards !
---
They probably have their computers set up in the dining area.
---
im grown enough to give your mother a good time and then break her heart so watch your tone with me
---
You laugh but they literally did this in SOE games like Planetside.
---
I had the same idea, went lower pop, told my friends, now my friends are in a 10,000 Q. Either way you will wait in line. It wont die down for a few weeks im guessing
---
It sounds like you're playing off-peak so it shouldn't be a huge issue. Comparatively of course. Honestly this queue is the biggest issue  in my life right now lol.
---
Logging in right now, 5k queue. Didn't have one earlier though.
---
&gt; there are no low population servers currently
---
Cause of the initial rush
---
It’s definitely great but I certainly don’t (obviously) feel the same thrill of exploration and discovery that I did.
---
What I keep thinking about is how different the experience is for me due to my age. I was born in ‘91 so I was 13 in vanilla and now I’m 28. A lot of my childhood memories are actually intertwined with the relationships I created on WoW. Some of my real life best friends I met on WoW. Nothing is going to recreate that magic, but this is as close as I’ll ever get. You only get to be a star struck 13 year old discovering a newfound love for fantasy once.
---
It’s actually been fun talking about it with my fiancée. I don’t think she understands why I’m hyped up to play an old game but she’s being a good sport and listening to my nostalgia rants.
---
I really hope so. I want to ditch Grobbulus if I have to
---
Not true! Every PVP has a queue at this point, including the ones they added yesterday. So your whole statement and opinion is pretty weak.
---
I got you OP
---
Its been a massive success for me with a distinct lack of queue times because i have a blessed ability of not playing on a Full or High pop server
---
Wtf my estimated queue time was 30 mins with my position in queue at 1000. All of a sudden it put me at 197 mins and 8700 queue.
---
I'm not expert, but i don't think you will see a reel multiboxer selling account, because the only way to multibox without breaking tos his having all account registered under the same name. (account sharing is against the TOS, so if you multibox account who are not registered by the same name, you're breaking it)  
---
And usually, to make it extra clear for GM that's your boxing, you registered all account into the same battlenet (not a obligation thought, especially on classic, but on retail, that give access to shared mount pets...)
---
Maybe if you use software? I dunno. You can just set your keyboard to cast a spell every minute and it’s no different than playing I’m pretty sure.
---
I regret not following the hype up to classic closer. 
---
I played classic way back in the day, and now watching on Twitch has that itch again. I may even roll Alliance this time.
---
What class are you enjoying?
---
You own green bench?
---
If you're still trying to get into queues and don't have the balls to switch servers then have fun crying about it.
---
How do you decide how to split it up? What happens when you split up guilds and friend groups? You can’t just do it Thanos style. 
---
And if you give people the option, what happens when only a small amount split off onto server 2 voluntarily? Then it has little effect.
---
&gt; Nope. 
---
Nope what?   You could easily move servers in NA and get no queues, except for a period last night, when you could change and get a short 25 minute queue.    Not sure what you are saying.
---
Sucks that you have to wait. I will say last night was crazy trying to do all the beginner quests with 1k other people.
---
I got a 4600 queue on blaumex or whatever it is for the first time just now. Not too bad.
---
It's a power play. You throw a totem and watch them not get the buff.
---
Dude, there is a Druid Trainer in The Park in Stormwind
---
A channel called Defcamp and Melderon have several long shaman vids that go into depth about them.
---
/macro
---
/cast Spellname
---
^ auto leveling skill
---
I'm arguing that they should add more layers, and that there shouldn't be almost as many people in queues as there are playing the game.
---
Even if you could (you can't, try it), you cannot mail gold to a character on another server.
---
More like 14 times
---
You literally copied what they said from an interview lmao. That's funny shit. Word for word.
---
I don't misunderstand anything. I understand that this is preventable even with the amount of people attempting to login at once. There are ways to manage this properly without a 9 hour wait time login to a login server.
---
You are struggling to understand that this is preventable entirely without effecting the future health of the server. That's a crock of shit.
---
It costs money they didn't spend.
---
thank you, well put
---
Except they can't get tokens with classic gold. 
---
He is mostly selling those characters / level service.
---
I'm just gonna say it. "You we're not prepared".
---
I made an omelette towards the end of my queue yesterday. Then played for 7 hours before going to bed. Great launch for me personally.
---
Woa
---
Sorry; you don't want to play a game - you want to play a visual novel.
---
You want to have everything be directed and taken care of, where you're just along for the ride.
---
Classic is a better game because it ISN'T holding your hand every step of the way.
---
I was laughing so hard yesterday while watching the cinematic as I was one of the first to log in. It looked like the gates of Alterac Valley BG opening, except all that was pouring out was the zombie invasion of the Forsaken, ready to cannibalize anything that came across their path.
---
Yesterday was the most fun in gaming I've had in years. So happy that this is out.
---
Or you can use a reddit app and not do any of that???
---
Snipping tool gang
---
Is it just me or is it way easier to farm cloth in Elwyn vs Dun Murogh? Kobold seem to drop it every second mob whereas frogs hardly ever do.
---
I'm luck to work 2nd shift east coast so I can wake up early enough to play
---
Yea.  Based on what they said, there could even be a realm of possibility where one server is so overloaded that even "Low" population realms have a queue.
---
Hopefully they push out an updated Server Population metric so we can actually make proper decisions about where to play...
---
I’m a no body but I raided MC and BWL because a friend and I joined a guild with the numbers and people that would be on enough all week to raid.  Some great times back then
---
The issue is that we expected this to be a social game we could play with our friends.
---
Now our friends are all scattered level-wise and its a shit show
---
Once I get water walking, so will everyone else around me.
---
Dont you get DC'd after a while?
---
Here's the issue. If they knew how to only add things to the game that only made it better then modern Wow would have built on classic and we'd all be playing that. Blizzard doesn't know how to do that.
---
PRESS  " PRT SC button on your keyboard  !
---
for god sake i did that even in vanilla !
---
Yeah I'm about to send a ticket in for a refund. Almost every server has high queues, can't even play. There's like 2 new servers released today that I can get into...but they'll be the first ones to die when the hype drops off.
---
Seems like the players were more prepared than blizzard
---
Seems like the rush is still going if there still are queues
---
only for retail players new to classic/vanilla
---
maybe the queue length is tilting him and he did it on purpose to drive away players
---
Can you still wall climb next to IF bank though? I need to try that one. Or get to the ceiling of the SW AH? Man i miss those days :)
---
The turn signal is a sign of weakness.
---
Well they were pretty vocal on most media. But i can see where being out of the loop can cause a shock to the sudden queue numbers. Yes. Blizzard handled the server load bad as hell. They should of had almost 50 servers on release but didnt. I was the one of my groups of friends who kept up with the servers and saw them get full over the past 2 weeks. Me and my friends have planed to be on several servers but stayed on incendious. I dont think it is necessarily unfair. Altho a huge pain in the ass. I dont think its unfair becuz everyone is having this problems. Some just have more time on their hands. While others do not. It is a matter of if you are willing to wait for the servers to die off or not. I played a solid of 5 to 6 hours last night. The way i saw it and it made me feel positive. That if i spent 15 bucks for a month of this game. And i get paid 11 an hour at work and work 40 hours. Ive alrdy paid off sub. 2 hours of playtime did that. But thats how i justify my spending on games.
---
Few weeks.
---
Leveling a druid and I swear the only night elves that don't have buffs are those that are dead.

---
Be quiet. And wait your turn like everyone else.
---
You think you're special because you took a vacation to play WoW and can play 8+ hours a day?
---
So now all of a sudden you are "Mr. WoW Special Guy" who should take priority over those who still would like to play although they can only squeeze in a few nights a week? 
---
Or that someone who finally got to login on the weekend should have to wait even longer to play with their friends because some of us were fortunate enough to play more?
---
Only a spoiled brat would think this way. Your parents did you a disservice raising you that way.
---
Sounds incredibly British.
---
Totally agree
---
Yeah cause it's day 2.  Initial rush is gonna be at least a week or so.
---
Not mad at all just find it funny that people are fucking stupid

Meth.
---
I logged on yesterday to the character screen. The Enter World button became available precisely at 6:00PM. I entered with no issue and then played for 4 hours with  &lt;50ms latency. The only issue was there being too much competition for mobs. But other than that I had no lag or issues with the launch.
---
Sorry that some people had a bad experience, but this was a pretty good launch for Blizzard.
---
yeah, only spells that have varying mana costs have multiple versions of the same spell.
---
Can't you just use the flight master?
---
There will probably be a 20-30ms difference
---
Can try and join a party of someone from another layer, also btw, layers are per continent, so maybe you just in a less populated part of the layer.
---
Fuck you
---
Hail, friend.
---
These NA servers should have short queues:  Atiesh and Old Blanchy.  FYI.   I am logging on to Atiesh and it doesn't seem like a big queue:  2200.
---
Bruh I joined and had a solid 4 seconds all to myself and my Shaman when suddenly 800 models materialized out of thin air.  
---
I grabbed my quest and ran to the boars hoping to get a few before the onslaught began...  wait...  
---
Why does this say battle stance?
---
My friends and I avoided the high pop servers and re rolled onto one that was created yesterday.  Both nights have had 4hr+ queues.
---
Did that last night. THAT server now has a queue.
---
Half of me thinks it’s bugged and wants me to reboot
---
Smaller more reasonable queues
---
Which is ok it means that it has a lot of people! 
---
I'm on a smaller server and it's way better
---
Playing with friends is a bust again tonight. Maybe next week?
---
Next time use a Mouse Jiggler, doofus.
---
My dude. Preaching the truth. I've been tryna to tell them sit back, relax, and enjoy the queue.
---
A lot of uber-nerds that have this kind of setup make stupid money. It's not that hard to fathom.
---
A lot of the modern world is built on-top of a layer of really old code. And if you know how to maintain them you can make like $20,000 a month.
---
Or he's a massive degenerate.
---
Wow, what an original idea that was never done in any game. I recommend using Autokey to make those clicks easier.
---
yea, but this multiboxing swarm is on classic - useless to farm on classic since gold on classic can't buy tokens.
---
Kurrinaxx has no que at the moment
---
It would be nice if they would update more than once today
---
9mins is a lieee
---
If you don’t care about PVP there’s no queue on mankrik US
---
Wasted.  It'll never happen again.
---
They don't off free xfers at all they only do it to help if it would. You planned this out but didn't plan for high populations? If you're on a low pop server I don't see the problem but you contradict yourself with that. Also you planned it out with a bunch of people don't you think millions of others did that too? Why are you still upset and saying it's a disservice????
---
That's a quick way to make sure layering never ever ends
---
I started in tbc and if my memory serves me right it was possible then ?
---
Why not just buy game time? It saves you the trouble.
---
You misspelled 're-roll'.

Loving the community aspect as well. Not loving the 5pm + chat crowd though

So the ques we are seeing are 2 and 3 times higher than the population cap???
---
clever. be carefull tho, this might look like some 3rd party programs doing
---
Judging by the time of this post, I was in the exact same wave that got DC'd and I have literally been sat in a queue to rejoin for nearly 7 hours.  I re-queued as soon as I DC'd.
---
Thex on Herod :D
---
Nice it is gamer o'clock what a coincidence
---
Joining the Alliance on Kromkush, Faerlina ques are a bit much
---
1 hour would be enough, but 6 hours of queue is WAY too much
---
There could have been more than enough servers open for the name reservation, and then merged before release according to pop.
---
I’ve been 220 just like this.
---
I don't see how you can choose either of those over WOTLK. Half the specs were garbage.
---
In WOTLK every spec was viable.
---
They warned you
---
Hmm I still only agree with parts of this but I believe we can find a middle ground on most of it. 
---
I’m not familiar with the Destiny system but it sounds pretty much like transmog, correct me if I’m wrong there. 
---
As for keeping the content relevant, what about something with the time walking? Same raid, same mechanics and all that jazz. 
---
Ya but most wouldn’t go there just to one shot things for the lolz. Only reason really is if you needed mats for a crafting profession or if you where trying to grind a rep for something. 
---
That being said it’s a similar scenario with a 60 running deadmines for linen or BoE drops. 
---
I agree that changes they made to the game over time has made the world feel smaller and smaller, but these are not them in my opinion.
---
Sharding...
---
Fuckin geezer boomer
---
Let me know if it works for you. Im stuck in a queue so not able to check yet lol

What's classic wow without stv, tanaris, and south shore pvp. You are missing out
---
Thanks. I saved the video and am sending this to blizzard as we speak.
---
Because he, like the rest of us is borderline retarded.
---
Aha. I'll try that when I get back through the queue lol
---
Sadly, it's a losing battle. Most guys on here and /r/wow only want to read and hear what they want. Reasoning either gets rewarded with massive downvotes or by being straight up ignored the majority of times.
---
With classic/vanilla if you were grouped up in open world the xp was split instead of everyone getting max like retail iirc. 
---
With dungeons I'm not too sure. He probably could? In dungeons. But I doubt hes gonna be able to solo unless hes quite high for say RFC or something.

All my friends are like lvl 20 allready, no one is going to change realm at this point. Also got the names i wanted two weeks back, so fuck blizz seriously
---
Good luck to both of you. And I hope your baby is happy and healthy. The first week or two for my fiancé and I where just shifts. I just hope your little boy or girl sleeps as much as ours does lol
---
Don't reboot, I think people got kicked out, so it made us drop, but they were able to log back in quickly and save their spot.
---
&gt; It is the most populated server.
---
As of a few hours ago, Faerlina had the highest queue count, and Stalagg had the longest ETA. [src](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294748/classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc).
---
Don't hate on this guy because he's in game and you're not lol.
---
Download questie?
---
If you pick a brand new server with no queue right now, it will probably have a multi hour queue within a few hours and smug butt lickers on here and the official forums will shit on you for not having a single play session on a new server and then abandoning it the next time you log in in favor of whatever server launched most recently. Basically, play where you want to. Eventually blizzard will stop trying to play puppet master with fake realm population levels and needless limiting of layering to force queues.
---
shut up boomer
---
you'll stick around and you'll like it now shut up and get in line like the rest of us.
---
You cannot know anybody's HP or resources, except yours.
---
I'm doing exactly that actually right now. I tried doing that yesterday for whitemane but it was so damn packed it didn't matter. 
---
Queue time for my realm is about an hour so it's nice to do it now and be able to play right when I get home from work. Thank god for remote connect.
---
Dude. Some people are going to be filthy rich in 2-weeks. Level 1 characters just flipping the hell out of the auction house and making a fortune. There will also be people (who you see in almost every general chat) essentially scamming noobs selling them things at stupid high costs compared to the AH.

Hi! Is this occurring in all threads or just specific ones? Also, see about logging out completely before retesting. Assuming you have game time on the account, relogging might refresh your account status for the forums.

Keep in touch and let me know how this goes.
---
Same feeling for priest
---
Tha'ts the single worst thing to do
---
What do you think happens with layers if there is 30k people on a server?
---
I'd wholeheartedly agree with you if it wasn't a paid service. We're literally paying to play the game, not to sit in a queue for hours.
---
I just logged into Old Blanchy (Medium) at 7:13 PM EST with 0 Queue, logged straight in.
---
I can't remember weather, but the more realistic/darker nights were removed because players who had lives complained that the game was too dark (if they were only able to play in the evenings after school/work).
---
Duskwood was originally designed to be like the Rock Tunnel from pokemon, pitch black and would require torches to navigate. This was removed sometime during the alpha iirc.
---
Heading home right now to log into the queue and then help with bed time.
---
I would prefer pvp
---
It wasn't even a matter if wanting vanilla over retail at that point in time. It's more that people bought a game that doesn't exist anymore and want to be able to access it.
---
0/6 boxes
---
sure, and if that's a problem for you retail is available.
---
now, as we said back in 2004. "kthxbye"
---
I really don't see how blizzard is ok with players sitting in these kind of queues....
---
I could never play on a laptop. Hard to see lol.
---
Really funny you thought that would work.
---
Asking if I know how to read, but then says "you got *know* idea what you are doing?"
---
Lmfao, fuckin retard
---
"Yes officer GM, that's the guy. The one that keeps jumping up and down like a baffoon."
---
At the 6hr mark here... send help
---
Whether you are in game or not, que dodging is not acceptable.
---
Lol it looks just like a Left 4 Dead 2 level, Cold Stream I think?
---
To be fair, I might be wrong in more recent policies, because I've not played retail since panda, but (especially in the earlier BC/wrath days) when free transfers came up, they were always high pop---&gt;low pop, never the other way. Some of the highest population servers weren't even listed on the paid transfers at times of peak overpopulation.  
---
TL:DR, unfortunately, don't plan on it, unless your friends want to move to you, which would be a more likely option.
---
I did the same thing with my fan. Except it just oscillates the bottom part of the barrel over the wasd and spacebar.
---
You guys are never gonna have problem with parties.
---
If you press "Change Realm" you can!
---
how is the queue worse today than launch wtf

---
probably not the most serious players because of dishonorable kills.... buts is gonna happen, and it's fun as shit tbh. I encourage you to try one you're a high enough level.
---
Go ahead and get my group of 10+ people to all abandon their names and toons they’ve leveled so far to go to some random realm. 
---
People should’ve stopped bandwagoning onto realms they didn’t intend to play on and causing even more ques
---
Blizzard really thought that this would be enough servers? This is kinda ridiculous that there is a queue on every single server now. I really think this tops any single expansion launch as well as the initial game launch. They should have known this would happen.
---
Reminds me of my friend and I leveling rogues up back in Vanilla.  We would only play in first person with no UI....Fun times...
---
Yeah and we haven't even hit the weekend yet. No one knows how long this is going to last and it sucks having to spent my entire play time waiting in queue, or getting disconnected to have to wait in queue, or switching to a low pop server for the 2nd time just for it to fill. This is whack.
---
Release infernals in enemy faction towns and quest hubs? (Or your own lol) Yeah, they're fun.
---
Then stop complaining? The game has literally been out for 25 hours and you're surprised that queues are slammed when you're playing with a group of 10 people.
---
Just chill out and in a week queues will be better if not gone completely.
---
and thats just because we thought it will be great. i mean it could have been.
---
What are you talking about?
---
More info please?
---
On remote desktop as we speak to ensure I don't afk dc when I eventually get in
---
Noob! That's what sick days are for.
---
This is one of my favourite things to have back. It makes it kind of viable to play with lower level characters without obliterating everything.
---
I thought you were going to complain about the server queues lol.
---
they finally changed their server algorithm.. good
---
Dead server is a meme from the bitchy bandwagon. This isn't your random private servers, It's Blizzard. They won't keep up a realm that is dead. They'll tackle the problem somehow be it by free xfers or merges.
---
Just happened to me.
---
It's been a little over a day now and people are acting like the Devs personally came to their house and slapped their mother.
---
Like y'all need to chill, theres millions of ppl tyring to play at the exact same time as you, it's just past the first day of launch and insanely popular rn. It's gonna be busy and you literally are not missing anything
---
Bit less private though. Streaming at least is just showing your screen and not giving Google access to your computer.
---
Method are not even going for a ragnaros kill week one. You can follow the race from guilds like Progress, APES, GRIZZLY. The only ones that have a chance at this.
---
Not on your end. Has been happening a bunch to everyone, don’t think the layering is handling the massive numbers of players like it should. It sucks but it is what it is
---
That's really not that slow tbh. Congrats!
---
Oh shit I'm level 9 as well and definitely haven't replaced it on my bar with level 2
---
I don't see a problem... Might as well be no with these que times
---
Autorunning doesn't prevent you from being kicked though.
---
Alt+Z.  It creates more immersion imo
---
O yeah! I always get them thorns. I also try to make sure void walkers and hunter pets get buffs first
---
We love our Blowme.
---
I think I saw a shammy called Shambulance :)) was that you? (Mankrik realm)
---
I also saw this on Fairbanks this morning, I really hope that official blizzard mods fly around and suspend these people for a few days
---
Layering is multiple temporary servers
---
On average queue position changed by 70 people a minute. Time is Eastern Standard Time.
---
I think it’ll only get better, everyone on private servers always seemed friendly, so once all the assholes quit there will be mostly a friendly community left over by people who generally enjoy helping people out.
---
Rank 14 grind
---
My server the queue was 2K and about a 30 min wait. That's reasonable. Not Blizzard's fault if you picked a high pop server. They warned you that it was going to be long wait queues and you should move to a different server. You didn't listen. Now you are paying the price, but it's Blizzard's fault.
---
Wait is that a thing? 
---
TODAY I LEARNED
---
They aren't farming WoW tokens on Classic, they are farming on Retail to buy the tokens which in turn gives them more game time to play Classic.
---
The current theory is that if a layer for some reason crashes it will boot all players. They've said as much as fixing queue issues (probably not letting these players get back in ahead of queue) is one of the reasons for maintenance tonight.
---
my server was low a few hours ago, now its full. Second wave hit once work let out
---
I'd guess over 9000.  
---
Sorry I had to.
---
No, it's Blizzard adding a layer. They'll do it again at some point and everyone in queue will get in.
---
I have had similar experiences recently in FFXIV, BDO, Star Wars Old Republic, Fallout 76 (though not an MMO).  As someone without Classic nostalgia, what makes this Classic experience so unique? Or is it largely will nostalgia?
---
Been buying bunch of stacks for 4s each at noggenfogger EU, so 20c each
---
May want to checkout retail if you are looking for an easier experience.
---
Ion was an amazing raid designer lead. And I'm not quite sure bfa is his fault, looks mor elike corporate decisions to me. As a side note, ioon is fan of classic'
---
Yep, Kirtonos, which was my refuge server last night from massive queue times even has a 3000 player queue at 30 minutes. Looks like I'm not playing tonight.
---
 this is true for rogues at least
---
&gt; Because it's not infinitely scaleable. The hardware can only support so many copies of Kalimdor/EK. So the server has a upper bound, just higher than no layers.
---
&gt; Layering is a solution that assumes a population drop.
---
I don't think the queue is based on a technical limitation, but a logistical one. They want to incentivize people to reroll on less populated realms. The technical limitation is when they remove layering completely. They really need the populations to spread out, and then fall off a bit, before then.
---
Troll post
---
I meant I try my best to get them both buffs
---
Now its the world of no weathercraft
---
Nope, just got disconnected being online for almost 5minutes, had been in queue since 18:00, back to 4500 queue.
---
Some people haven’t even made characters yet man hold on
---
Fuck this guy. He's dumb as fuck.
---
Found several people in Myzrael who craft linen bags for free minus mats
---
I decided to check in at the top of the last three hours and each hour was almost exactly the same progress. At my current position of 4950 I'm looking at an estimated 10hrs remaining rather than the games estimate time of 90-100 minutes which hasn't gone outside that range since I joined the queue...
---
It's directly Blizzard's fault lol
---
this
---
sorry it's bugged and not letting me remove/mark some quests as having been completed, I have used this addon since it's release so know how it is supposed to work... and I do not have this ability in Classic currently
---
If your 21 in the queue that means no one else has logged out since you’ve gotten to that position in the queue.
---
All but 4 now.
---
We are in peak hours as everyone is getting home from work and few people are logging off. Just have to be a patient bear and pray that you don’t get kicked once you eventually get on
---
Nope, no changes are announced. And I doubt there will be any.
---
been stuck right 1623 for the past hour aswell...Herod
---
Why I went priest over pally and druid. Way more buttons
---
Method isn’t in the race for week 1 kill. They are just hosting a event.
---
the queues are like 12 hours tho
---
shift+w gang
---
also you can spam it all the way thru your play time ! boss kills new items pvp kills , there will be time labeled in your wow folder
---
There are some servers without queues
---
Are you using them or just holding out for higher prices?
---
Wow I thought stay safe was fast.
---
Bigglesworth 8k in q, 122min
---
Pfft  what server are you on? I’m like 90% sure I saw your bones.
---
Thank god I work night shift and have a fucked up sleep cycle. Played for a tiny bit last night, woke up at 5AM and couldn’t go back to sleep so I hopped on. Played most of the day with no problems at all and now that the rest of the world is getting on and the que times are high, I’m getting off because I’m tired.
---
Everyone can just go to the low population realms and actually play.
---
don't be scared of wpvp. it's Really fun. you just need to make sure you're looking for kills too so you aren't only dying and not killing. alliance vs horde is a fucking war; treat it as such. most wpvp will be with people roughly your level. if you get ganked by high level players just quest somewhere else for a minute. it's really not the game-ruining struggle some people make it out to be
---
It was funny watching the intro cinematic while zooming into northshrie and see someone typing in caps HOLY FUCK WE MADE IT!!! with bunch of other people
---
Blizz really shat the bed and rolled in it yet again. Also, I’m not buying their whole rhetoric of “it’s not easy to shutdown a low population server.”
---
Cant compete with those that have no life
---
Same here. Level 9 too and not a single bag
---
Did this on lvl 12 rogue while we both ran into silverpine forest. Almost instantly after he did /yell THANKS
---
Made me chuckle
---
It’s crazy how that works lmao people really losing it
---
He is the game director, BfA being Blizzard fucking Azeroth, it’s entirely his fault. 
---
Legion sucked to start off with, it got progressively better as soon as they started listening to the player base but BfA is below WoD levels of bad.
---
I've been stuck at 20 for the last 30 mins
---
I've had some luck selling them for 10s a stack in trade. Sold about 4 stacks.
---
They've tripled (maybe even more) since launch day yesterday.
---
Adding more servers won't help much. The damage is done. They launched with around 9 servers, and people already had plans to be on X server.
---
This is why you listen to your fanbase. Too many servers is better than not enough. Nothing wrong with merging a month down the road.
---
So by saying "fix it" you mean I should install One Note? Because One Note is not Windows 7. There are a lot of tools which add shortcuts for (advanced) screenshotting. But I was talking about the shortcut Win + Shift + S which is a operating system function of windows 10 (and not available in prior versions of windows)
---
At least you know etiquette. I buffed the same priest twice and he didnt even throw me a fort. Psh
---
make this and in 6 months : WTF BLIZZARD , YOU SAID YOU WOULD REMOVE LAYERS , WHAT IS THIS SHIT
---
The streamers are in the same boat, but they’re getting paid for it.  You want that server, you wait.  I’m sure the people who are on that server solely because of streamers wouldn’t think twice about switching if their chose streamer did.
---
Wait that’s in Westfall?
---
Makes sense, thanks

---
Did you make sure you checked all of the requirements for running it? https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Blizzard-App
---
Can we come together as a community to teach people how to spell "queue"? It is very easy, simply a 'q' followed by two instances of 'ue'. Please try it yourselves
---
No queue does not mean it's playable though. 
---
The way they set up instancing in classic, you are questing with the same amount of people on a low pop realm that you would be on a high pop realm right now. Each server makes instances of each zone and tries to fit like 2k people in there before making another. Most realms have way over 2k people. 
---
The best fix would be to make more instances with less people. Vanilla cannot handle the limit they set. It's still taking hours to tag certain quest mobs on the low pop realm I tried.
---
Welp... I was in the queue for 5 hours last night then had to go to bed.  
---
Hope I get to play today or I'm just gonna cancel my sub until it chills a bit.
---
Can you switch to a lower population realm.
---
Single bulb, got it at bestbuy. (its called an illumi)
---
Sounds like a personal problem of server choice
---
I guess this explains why my place in the queue sometimes went up by one or two instead of going down...
---
90% will die on the way there. 8% will need to get up for work so they lod off. The remaining 1600 people will take orgrimmar no problem.
---
you think you want to play on a server with world PvP, but you really dont.
---
People took off work today and probably tomorrow. It's labor day weekend in the US as well, so I don't expect things to calm down until next Tuesday.
---
I completely think it's ridic that people are unable to log in. Like it seems like Blizz has a total lack of understanding of their player base and the popularity classic has.   
---
But people also need to realize that their precious .50 cents a day is pretty negligable to WoW so saying stuff like "I'm not paying for x" is entirely unhelpful and childish. 
---
Then again I haven't had to wait in a queue so it's hard for me to personally be angry. But if I had to wait (had i not taken these 2 days off) I'd be furious for sure.
---
&gt;i assume it should be the best pvp class
---
You assume wrong, for the average player paladin is one of the worst pvp class, unless you plan on healing. It's extremely gear dependent, you need BIS for everything if you want to be viable as ret in pvp
---
no queue. yet.
---
Im assuming you kill kittens for fun
---
Dammit I just did that with heroic strike
---
This was already posted
---
the 5 servers will be full soon
---
Same happened to us here in Sydney.
---
Get home from work 6.30, spend 4 hours in the queue, play for less than an hour and realm restart... 
---
Gutted!
---
Whos to say he didn't make that comment with secret plans in the works for a wow classic client.  Knowing this community, and how oppositional we are about any direct challenge to our needs? 
---
 I think we got played.  Oop que is up, bbl
---
Forgive my ignorance because it's been a long time since I played, but didn't Timewalking show that it was feasible to take powerful Raid Gear into a downscaled environment?
---
There is no gladiator in vanilla.

Leveling a priest I've buffed everyone with fort.... except for that one guy who demanded it.

I downloaded the game on my work computer to wait in queue lol.
---
[Been there, done that...](https://i.imgur.com/gY2vSiE.jpg)
---
;) 
---
The trip is very fun though, must've been a long run on Night Elves though! Congrats!
---
If you knew how popular it would be you guys could have planned on  switching when a new server popped
---
everyone must've gotten off work at the same time, queues were nil earlier today
---
This right here. The times and numbers don't make a lot of sense. If no one has truly logged out in 40 minutes then fine but it seems hard to believe
---
And I'm not doing well...
---
This is a problem the queue times are natural but the problem is that there are tons of low/med servers that are still packed but people refuse to leave these 30k queue time servers because blizzard has marked some of them as low and when these literal baboons read the word low population they instnatly assume no one is on those servers.
---
and Pazzi
---
Most armor merchants/weapon vendors you can repair at. Look for forges when you go into towns or major cities and most of those characters can repair your gear at. It turns your mouse into an anvil when you over someone who can repair your stuff.
---
What if I waited till I was logged into the server, actively playing. Could I still swap computers or is my spot saved on my laptop?
---
screw you botman l:&lt;
---
I’ve already switched realms twice and the realm I landed on (that was created post-launch) has 2+ hour queues
---
You don't know how things work around these parts do ya?
---
No not so large fuck I always do that
---
A general rule of thumb most crafted epics that are bis are BoP. Few things aren't like lionheart helm, but tailoring stuff is.
---
My rotation is super simple. With a slow 2hander, cast Seal of Righteousness as you approach a mob. Judge it to get the big burst of damage and immediately cast Seal of Command. Then just stand there auto-attacking.
---
With a fast 2hander skip SoC and just Judge and reapply Righteousness as needed.
---
Sometimes when I'm in a place where I don't want mobs to run away I'll replace Seal of Righteousness with Seal of Justice, and judge *that* on a mob as I approach—so they can't flee and pull other mobs when I'm about to kill them.
---
But 99% of the time your rotation is: SoR &gt; JoR opener &gt; Seal of Command till dead. That's it!
---
Can anyone explain how the queue can go from ~3500 to 34 and I’ve been sitting at 34 for half an hour now
---
Lol I can't believe how many children thought there would be no queue. Why would they waste resources for a spike that will never be matched again. You're made because you didn't get what you wanted when you wanted it. It's wow. Launches arent smooth. They never have been. Grow up.
---
I thought you were pretty clear the first time.
---
I will be honest, I did think the initial servers were too little, but even I didn't expect this much servers being this full
---
12,000 in queue. 
---
ETA - 9 mins?!  
---
on OCE servers, it was 10,000 in queue and ETA - 11hrs hahaha
---
Been in my "90 minute" wait queue for 2 hours now. I feel this.
---
Legacy-wow
---
most of the medium ones and every single low pop one is without queue for me.
---
Well people did ask for #NoChanges so idk
---
Paid $10 to get that sweet name reserve on a server I can't play on.
---
Never saw a line in 10 hours on horse. 
---
I did see stacks of 40+ people on the respawn points though.
---
Smolderweb is the only server without a queue right now.
---
Hes popular for being a negative person. You're not my people.
---
I'm honestly starting to think that he was wrong...
---
are you guys literally waiting half the day to play on these servers?
---
i cant imagine why youd do that.
---
Going to play Devil's Advocate simply for the sake of playing Devil's Advocate:
---
It's 10 hours. You don't know how many of us spent the summer testing out classes and professions on the Siberian Private Gulag Servers.
---
Costs nothing to sell in trade chat.
---
I need this game but alas I broke my computer and my bank acct is in the same condition
---
We skipped this, wasn't worth it xD
---
My decisions are informed. I can overcome obstacles that were seemingly insurmountable when I was new. I can push the limits of my character. It's satisfying. My first ten levels I died only once because someone else trained some mobs by me and they redirected their ire towards me. I'm enjoying playing with knowledge and using my limited resources carefully.
---
Holy shit there all full. Who ever does research for  Blizzard they fucking suck.
---
Exactly same here. I went from getting crushed in Platinum 2 2v2s to dominating in Diamond 3 3v3s during my queue last night.
---
I saw a good amount of servers in US with very small queues or no queues at all, I don't think we need more; that will just make them feel super dead after the initial hype period.
---
Almost 17 at the moment myself
---
5 on my Tauren Druid
---
That's your own fault honestly... You had weeks to reserve different names and instead sat there foolishly expecting the biggest servers to be playable for the average person.
---
Doesn't solve the fact that flying mounts make the world feel smaller
---
We thought we did, and we did. And apparently so did a fuck ton of other people.
---
And at later lvls put down wf totem just to /flex
---
Problem is we eventually want to get rid of layering so that people grow accustom to seeing and interacting with the same people. If we over use layering, we'll never be able to get rid of it. Layering isn't there to solve the overall population issue, but to reduce competition for mobs / quest objectives during the initial rush.
---
No, but it makes sense. There's less people in front of you who cancel the queue for any reason, because there's less people and soooooo close now. Ya'll waiting for someone to log off now, or disconnect.
---
Yeah, I tried that last night and no luck. Even running off a fresh pop_os install.
---
19, roughly 16h played.
---
Report them
---
Man, I'm loving not knowing where to go. Obvs with some of them I remember, but it's great just exploring for stuff. Gen X here, though, so I understand why some might need their hands held.
---
I bet you still couldn’t log I after you finished making this
---
Are you feeling ok? It's been established that the majority of gamers are men, and it has always been so.
---
Yeh just found that out logging in this evening, pretty shit stuff.
---
Short answer no.
---
To elaborate, the title Gladiator was appointed to arena, which was only released in BC expansion.
---
If you read the comments, and the responses to them, and what they were responding to, you'll see that many players on this sub for the past year and a half unironically feel this way.
---
I wonder if they still do...
---
Yo Pizza! You COD me a bow for 7silver. Still using it =]
---
how is it hard to believe that someone hasnt logged out in 40 min when people have been playing for around 24 hours straight?
---
Having been an original vanilla player from launch, I can tell you many, many people had wasted countless hours over the years fuming and posting about this very thing, all to no avail.  
---
Welcome to the suck.
---
Been DCed a few times but it always puts me back where I was
---
C L A S S I C
---
A single player playing affects the in game economy too.  Better ban everyone.
---
I'm gonna upvote this because fuck you
---
Both!
---
Exactly. If the streamer chose to. But they won't because they get priority que. So their fans are stuck Ina longass que and blizzard was very well aware of what was going to happen to that server alone. It's shit business and you know it
---
I’d wager no BGs before 2020
---
This. My god, it baffles me how people dont understand this crap.
---
After playing private servers for years with gold sellers/hacks/wrong scripting/huge amounts of bugs we get classic and this dude has the balls to post this. 👌
---
Man wtf is up with so many people coming to Fairbanks lmao. No one wanted to come here in the beginning and now it feels like so many people bandwagoned onto the realm
---
Can anyone link that post of the class pro and cons that gets posted here sometimes
---
I’ve been having many experiences like this as well. The difficulty makes a stronger bond because everyone understands the struggle
---
Can we come together as a community to teach people how to spell "queue"? It is very easy, simply a 'q' followed by two instances of 'ue'. Please try it yourselves!
---
This definitely qualifies for r/4panelcringe
---
I went to ol blanchy and played 14 hrs straight with hundreds of people and had a blast
---
Again, fans **want** to be on streamer servers, there is no need to be.  
---
How is it blizzards fault that all the streamers and their thousands of fans all went to the same servers?  They were giving numbers in the 8000-10000 per server.  Some Individual streamers have enough fans to overflow a server on their own.  Don’t try and tell me you didn’t know that going in.
---
It’s not going to be fair for some people, it happens, like when Disney land shuts down the ride when you were in line for an hour.
---
Changing servers for streamers would be easy, they are streaming, and the people who care are watching, just say I’m switching servers and everyone gets the message.
---
I got into one instantly a few hours ago, just to try.
---
Can't recall the name, Skullmaw? EU.
---
But I want Gehennas where all my boys are so fml 5hrs queue
---
oh no, a windmill! Everyone hide from the spooky windmill!
---
It's day 2. There isn't any consequence. The longer you wait, the more consequences there will be.
---
huh wdym....? isn't it amazing that there are so many people who never even touched the game? it brings back the real feel so much better
---
I was world first level 3 shaman to punch a boar on my server
---
In fairness, I have a multiscreen setup.  you gonna get a lot more picture then you care if i use print screen.
---
Ehh I’m still not sold on the concept. I get what you’re saying though.
---
Honestly they should just not provide a time because it is hopeless to try.
---
Thanks man! What do you think the best professions are to have for warrior?
---
Anyone know what the Kirtonos queue looks like?
---
I just reroll on new realm and got 9 good names already taken in the first i was plating, so good i dont waste suscription for name reserve
---
It’s scummy as hell, but Blizzard is giving people much choice.
---
Yeah and I'm sure there are vids on youtube about Perl too, and tips and stuff about those addons too.
---
And yeah if it says updated, it's good to go for classic. Enjoy
---
Probably disconnects.
---
If you make a simple macro like
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Fireball
---
&gt;/cast Fireball
---
and it will function nearly identically to Fireball but will always use the highest level. You can make a the macro a little fancier but this will be good enough for most people.
---
Weapon master actually. Usually found in major cities
---
Of course they’d be dead. Everyone already picked the server their friends/guilds are on so they’re not going to switch regardless of queue times because that’d require some guild members/friends throwing away name reservations and time on a toon because of Blizzard’s inability to anticipate the size of fan base that was going to play.
---
They’ve pretty much shot themselves in the foot at this point.
---
Goto another server or dont complain
---
Yeah, I waited 5 hours all evening, becouse of totaly random dc
---
2/10 troll effort.  You get 2 points for the low hanging fruit Nazi outrage, but that’s all I can do.
---
At least at work by the end of the shift, IT was able to upgrade the system to run on two toaster instead of one.
---
I've been in que since 3pm est. 1200 atm.
---
SO. MUCH. WAITING.

Didn't know De Rebecca played WoW

505 minute queue at the moment. Really? Blizzard didn't see this coming? Pay to stay in queue...

It has been very inaccurate as I've sit here for 3+ hours watching it go up instead of down and then down and then up and then down and then and up and up and up and then down.... like people were cutting line.
---
Try this quote
---
" I can't change realms"
---
Do you know what that means?
---
Or, and this is fine, and is just as much fun if you want it to be, the start of a lowly adventurer that will aspire to rise, and won't. It's that last part that really hooked me about WoW originally; there are heroes out there, for sure. But you aren't guaranteed to be one of them. Not by a long shot. That's what really defines an RPG for me, that your character's story and goals aren't necessarily going to be the same as the next guy's. That all really went out of the window from retail a long time ago.
---
I got around to doing it, it still works you must have gone to the wrong part.

Happily combat skills (like Rogue) upgrade, but the other skills don't slot themselves. Forgot I'd bought Evasion, and remembered after an ugly, preventable death.
---
14 shaman, fire totem quest really held up my leveling with all that walking
---
Only one of those is a PVP server. The total queue's on PVP server's easily add up to tens of thousands. You don't seem like a smart guy but I'm sure you can do the math on it. You think we might need more servers or no?
---
It seems ridiculous for them to estimate right down to the minute. I mean come on just say between 3-5 hours lmao
---
Staves &gt;2h mace/axe?
---
PepeHands so many dead cats and deer...
---
I just wish the dust will settle faster.
---
Server population caps exist for a reason. It would slow gameplay and increase latency to increase the cap. More layers won't help your queue friend.
---
Move man, its not going to get better on Herod any time soon.
---
Thanks for the clarification everyone.
---
"Yo, dawg, we heard you like lines, so here's a line for your line so you can wait while you wait..."
---
Yeah there are definitely some omega level neckbeards here. These are the people who took all of the fun Classic hyperbole banter literally.
---
I've gone to like 3 already. How many times should I do levels 1-10 lol
---
they calculate how many people log out per minute and transform it into an average time left based on your position.
---
but right now, possibly because of layering and grace periods, the calculation simply doesn't work and therefore cannot be trusted.
---
Because it's a fucking estimate. How the fuck do you expect it to be accurate?
---
All you see on Reddit is people complaining about 3-4 realms that are high pop.
---
Kromcrush,Eastern NA pvp, 
---
So from what I remember of the crazy circus which was launch last night in the orc/troll starting zone. 
---
Warriors , warriors for days , then shaman next.

A question followed by a statement?

I know, right?

Play a low pop server and get that bang for your buck my guy
---
Why does my Que go up!? i've been bouncing around 525 and 530 for an hour now.
---
Lvl 5 1 hour played
---
Classic just came out. If you've played wow before this shouldn't be a surprise. If they opened enough servers to get rid of the wait you'd have dead servers in 6 months when the population levels out. 
---
Blizzard has been doing this for a long time and I would think that they have an idea of what they're doing.
---
Yes it is the company‘s fault that your supposed friends would not wait for you to level.
---
Shit same here brother.
---
I moved... not worth my names. I want to play wow
---
Not possible if you have a guild or a bunch of friends of a high population server that already invested time into it and reserved names.
---
By aggregating peoples average play time? Im not in that sector at all and that took me .2 seconds to think of.  
---
But they shouldnt even try is the bigger point. What was your point? Pointing out stuff is hard? I dont know. But it was weird that post you made.
---
all NA realms are full right now except an rppvp realm.
---
Read, I said I enjoy the competition, lol.

Running up a a grassy hill in the barrens last night with the dark sky and prominent stars was quite beautiful. The updated foliage does aid this a bit

Classic wow by Eric Andre.    Or, let me in
---
To demand what I have paid for? Yes, I do have balls to do that. It's not like i'm being unreasonable. You dig a hole, you figure out how to get out. People that actually got in don't want to start over. People that didn't get in can't play with them, and most still can't get in because we don't have all day to wait.
---
Except I'd rather not have to be up at 5 am before my shift just to play a game? My post work time is my free time, except it's been queue simulator
---
It's you're worried about the dollar that cost you I'm terribly sorry for your life circumstance.
---
Does this being in that arena signify how much you identify with troll culture and how triggered this makes you feel?
---
Anyone know how smoulderweb queue is looking?
---
You could check que times during the peak hours, find the one with the lowest and go with that one. That or just have to wait it out till the surge dies down
---
Yea, I just got kicked from the queue back to the login screen (no disconnection error though, just went straight to login). I jumped in the queue  almost 3 hours ago when i got home from work. I was almost there too :(
---
I'm trying to play when I can but I can get past queues.
---
What is really comes down to is the when the Original WoW came out it was like lightning in a bottle. But one of the most enduring elements was that it came out in a time where collaborating and community were integral components of the gameplay rather than "features" accessed via separate menus or out of game API interfaces.
---
It took the more hardcore and user unfriendly aspects of the other large titles of the time (like EQ, Ultima, SWG) and trimmed them to make them less punishing which elevated the accessibility to people with less free time on their hands and thus an institution was founded.
---
5 out of almost 30 servers is not good. Especially when the 10s of thousands in queue start to move to those.
---
if its instant, i might ditch this queue
---
What the fuk .
---
Streaming is the opposite of private.

Google aint worried about your porn collection dont worry unless your googling how to make bombs.

Wowhead with the Thottbot skin ftw!

I moved it became full
---
If this isn't faster you are not qualified to operate a phone
---
that's exactly what i'm saying. It's highly unlikely a problem of competence (otherwise the retail would be down every other day) but a matter of company deciding not to invest in it.
---
There aren’t any low-medium pop available right now are there?
---
Well considering Stalagg was listed as "High" and not "Full" up to the eve of the release, and never once did Blizzard call it out by name like they did with Herod, Faerlina, etc, is that really my group of 40+ peoples fault for thinking it would be tolerable?  Instead we're greeted with the worst queue times out of every NA server.
---
Blizzard 100% fucked this launch logistically.
---
Blizzard is an indie company.
---
holy fuck now this 1k wall on faerlina, 5hrs and counting
---
That cost you a dollar. I'm sorry if that's substantial to you.
---
Are there any servers that don’t have a 2+ hour queue now?
---
Gosh, the comma confused me until I saw you are from Europe.. That coefficient on X looked way off to me.
---
I got a new job while waiting for queue. I thought this game was supposed to be bad for career prospects?
---
Wipe your lips
---
C:\Program Files(x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\interface\addons
---
Should be that or very similar. Drop the unzipped folder into there and make sure that folder doesn't have only a copy of itself inside.
---
Good god, I bet you are being paid off by blizzard. This is unacceptable, people took off work, planned their lives around this launch. This game is 15 years old.
---
Absolute foul on Blizzard. They better be offering free game time like they did when the game originally launched.
---
But instead, they are going to keep whitewashing their subreddit and forums.
---
&gt; general immersion.
---
Ah, yes. Immersion. Nothing like 5000 characters all spawning in at once inside each others. Also blocking NPCs from being visible. YIkes
---
Guess not D:

It depends on why you are on Herod

Rubbish.
