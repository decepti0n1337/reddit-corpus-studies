I'm buffin' errbody!  Hoping it increases the sense of community.
---
I've been trying to log in for almost 22 hours now with zero luck.
---
Pretty sure playing with friends is the biggest appeal for a lot of people. So going to a less populated server isn't worth losing a queue spot for.
---
Move
---
The picture is of a person multibox - which is playing multiple characters at the same time. So one person is controlling all 21 of those mages!
---
Yes, lets ban grouping up together and coordinating something.
---

---
Sounds reasonable
---
I waited five minutes to get on a server. Of course, I made a grown up choice to pick the new server with the lower wait time. Once the hype dies down, I may have to transfer out, and OP probably won't. 
---
OP is an adult, but fails to acknowledge his part in this. He made an informed choice.

I think i remember this kind of thread on bnet forums when vanilal was released LUL
---
[removed]
---
also very difficult to transfer guilds
---
Last played around 2 hours ago on Kirtonos, haven't had a queue all day. Cant speak for Europe.
---
As I said in my post: the idea is to wake up early and play before your job if you are able instead of after. By going to bed early and then waking up early, you're essentially shifting your clock backwards. You still get the same hours of sleep, just at a different time.
---
I know lots of people don't want to do this or cant for various reasons but it seems to be when queues are the best.
---
I can't make Bliz get more servers, but I can try and work with the nonsense we currently have.
---
I’m trying to figure out when the perfect time to queue up will be to not start too early or too late.
---
Yup!!!!   I am So frustrated
---
Some of the big things that make people hyped for Classic:
---
- Nostalgia.  Obviously.  WoW was the first MMO for literally millions of people.
---
- Emphasis on social interaction.  People mostly don't talk to each other at all on modern WoW to the point of being rude sometimes.  In Classic you have to communicate to play a lot of the content.  Also there's downtime in Classic that doesn't exist in modern WoW, like waiting to regen health/mana or traveling to places, and that time is also good for chatting.
---
- It's... "hardcore?"  Weird thing to say about WoW, but compared to modern WoW or really any modern MMO, Classic WoW doesn't hold your hand very much.  It was considered super casual back then, but gaming is so different today with the emphasis on easy casual play and instant gratification.  For example, there are no quest markers pointing you where to go, you have to actually use the map to navigate from landmarks and stuff.  And enemies don't just roll over and serve up loot.
---
Do it via twitch ?
---
You may want to ask r/wowaddons about this; it'd require either you or someone else to design the addon.
---
Wow, this is a great idea.
---
Are multiboxers annoying? Hell yes, do you only run into them every once in awhile? Also yes.
---
The local Walmart was all out of fresh servers, I guess they had to order more.
---
Few days of pain, for months of gain.  
---
Thank fuck I didn't waste holiday days in work.... no like launch itself, every expansion released etc taught people anything :D
---
Half kidding but 100% true.

Whats the matter dude? There are new realms every day, you are just being a kid
---
It means that you are unable to understand the fact that other servers exist.  There is literally no force in the universe preventing you from changing realms other than your own stubbornness.  You choose to not change realms.  Don't pretend that you are helpless or a victim here.
---
Let me know if you make the switch. Curious since I have a dude there.
---
So they should have had enough servers to handle launch, and then most of those servers become ghost towns when the tourists leave?

I read this funny story a while ago about a guy who thought it was bullshit so in defiance when nobody was there he threw all the towels in the water. When their owners came back one by one it was anarchy.
---
Queue
---
THIS. I’m stuck on Grob because of the people I want to play with. If I were alone I’d move in a heartbeat.
---
The obvious answer is to have characters on every server.
---
You understand that even the servers that just opened in the last 24 hours are full right? They honestly should open like 5 at a time and they will all end up at least medium (healthy according to blizz). Down the road if servers end up dead consolidate them.
---
Just move to another server, find the one with the lowest queue and go there.
---
Rattlegore? #rattlegang
---
The right choice!
---
Just giving out quick heals to people that need it really make me happy
---
What I personally do is I print screen, paste to paint, select the area that I want to show ctrl+C then ctrl+V to imgur
---
I need to start adding these dudes to B.net aswell just so I can stay in touch with them easier. B.net is probably the only non-authentic feature that I am okay with having since it just makes your life easier when trying to connect with randoms that you meet
---
I have a full time career and can’t spend much time on video games due to adult life. Making people pay helps me not have to do mindless grinding to make money so I can use what little time I have doing a dungeon or something.
---
If they allowed you to play retail while you waited in line to play classic, in wouldn't sting so bad lol. So far I've just been playing ARAM on League of Legends.
---
Lol flying ruined everything about wow... stop liying to yourself ;)
---
You will still go afk without other key presses.
---
I've been stuck in those queues since yesterday, haven't even played yet. I'm thinking about just cancelling for a month
---
Voidwalker too please!
---
Is that an answer or a question? I was genuinely curious. I'm picking up Shaman and just hit 10, so I want to know haha
---
The queues are insane right now, I've been in 3 different 3-4 hours queues since launch.  It should calm down in a week or two.
---
You didn't even read what he was saying. How much of this die-off is going to be caused solely by these massive queues? Who wants to play a game you have to wait 6-8 hours in order to play? Then you get to play for an hour before being force-disconnected.
---
Honestly if I were a new Blizzard customer I would never invest my money in any of their products ever again if this was the first experience I was expected to endure.
---
Mlady
---
Guys, just be glad wow classic is even a thing.
---
Having too many players is a good problem to have. It shows Blizz just how bad the community wanted this.
---
Druids have been the real heroes for me while leveling my shaman. I love it!
---
The census showed that stuff's pretty equalized.
---
This is BS. It keeps you in queue for like 3 minutes tops if you leave it.
---
We barely scraped by that 1lvl/hr mark. Duo Paladin Warrior dream team!
---
I herbed/mined some on bfa over the last 3 weeks or so to rack up gold for a couple tokens, and the amount of multiboxing druid farmers I saw was unreal. The whole thing where nodes dont despawn for other people until like 20-30 seconds after its been picked by someone is pretty insane.
---
It lets blizz know how popular the servers are, and lets people start together with people with no moving once their server has 3hr queue
---
Planning their lives around a video game ... yup, Blizzard is the one with issues. They're doing what they can to ensure the game doesn't fizzle out in the long run.
---
For sure. I am hoping it dies down after everyone gets there fix at least in NA after the 3 or 4 day weekend for most people.
---
Why do I have to kill 50+ boars for 3 intestines to not even drop?
---
Holy fuck.
---
Well, sorry you won't be playing then.  Have fun in whatever game suits you!
---
...You are going to quit right?  Because it's so terrible?  I assume so.  Because otherwise you're just whining for the sake of whining and rewarding Blizzard for being "out of touch with reality".
---
Or, put into terms you're fond of:  "Imagine supporting a company as incompetent as this LOL"
---
I agree that it will probably calm down in a few days, but we paid money for a product. Name another industry that would get away with not issuing a partial refund to the customer. 
---
"Yes. I'd like a large pizza for dinner tonight. Here's ten bucks."
---
"Great. Thank you. You can't have your pizza tonight. But we will gladly get you your meal next week."
---
From what i have seen on stream, people are finding ways to stay on to avoid queue times.
---
did someone confirm the time that you have to be afk for the server to disconnect you?
---
&gt;I'd rather they take this tactic of preserving the overall health of classic, 
---
Based on the assumption of "many of the players who join the game on day one will quickly disappear". 
---
Watch and see how wrong they are going to be.
---
Belongs more than Asmon
---
nah man wait 1o hours
---
Just take your time and so what seems fun. Go to barrens after mulgore. Or silverpine forest if you want
---
Go to Durotar for ?-10
---
After that you can chose whatever. Mulgore quests are generally really, really slow.
---
We moved from Herod to Stalagg to Skeram to Incendius. And here I am in a 4+ hour queue.
---
Seriously.  Start with all the stuff that was canned in Vanilla like Karazhan, Hyjal, Emerald Dream, etc.  Instead of increasing the ilvl by a lot, just fill in the gaps for off-specs and whatever because you had things like T3 Warrior set being mainly for tanks, so make the next tier good for DPS Warriors so they can quit wearing leather and mail to make shit work.  Use the gear to buff Hunters and hybrid DPS if you want.  Make a decent Prot Pally set for once!
---
Well your initial reply with an emoji left a lot unsaid.. I replied but no response back.. Which leaves me to believe you had no idea that’s how he got his name..
---
Bunch of entitled babies in that thread.
---
They also have none of my friends.
---
Kinda rude, considering some of us on Herod or Whitemane have several friends and family members who live in diffferent states that we coordinated to all play together. It’s not as simple as “refusing to join another server.” Also, would you re-roll if you already got to level 20 last night? I doubt it.
---
With gear that most players will never attain or know about.
---
That’s the real kicker. People are looking at just the numbers but not the ridiculous work behind them.
---
Should I go rogue or shaman and why?
---
You mean you should be able to get in the game in 4 months
---
Wait like we all are.
---
Youre not alone
---
i snuck into hyjal too and a gm texted me "you aren't supposed to be there"  and ported me out
---
I'm like 99% sure that enough people are using some form of randomized anti-afk macro now (because of the queues) that its just that bad. I've gone from 1150 -&gt; 1050 in like almost 2 hours.
---
What low pop server? lol
---
&gt; 2nd day of this completely terrible rollout, players should be compensated for this
---
Are you saying there were no realms at all that you could play on?
---
Can confirm, Maul rank 2 replaced itself for me earlier.
---
I just got off. Had her send me an update. I’m at 2k. Still higher than I hoped but better than starting at 9000
---
That’s a thing??
---
Throwing blessings at everyone I see, I feel you
---
Are you in a party? You have to manually set the loot type every time you join a new party or it seems like nothing drops.
---
Yeah I get it, but on the other hand having queues push 5+ hours is ridiculous. The game just came out so I can expect 1-2, but for those who took time off work just to play for a small amount of time I can understand the frustration. 
---
Also people getting kicked off and going back into a queue is upsetting to hear.
---
man....connected 2 hours ago and i was 8k queue, said 70 min...now at 1700...45 min queue, whats up with that.
---
This launch is bad and Blizzard should feel bad
---
I mean yes, zep to UC was in vanilla from durotar
---
I'm guessing it will, because many people also took time off for a week or two to stirctly play wow. So once the hype is over, they'll just balancing wow with their life, which will balance out the servers.  That's what I'm guessing.
---
Won’t even notice the lag
---
All of my friends have been able to wait in these long queues to get hours in and switching servers for a shorter queue makes no sense for me.
---
I mean it's because everybody on the server is shouting "dont log out! Big queue to get back in!" So literally nobody is logging out
---
That were not prepared!
---
You’re right, High population and no queue. I’m alliance on Incendius so this might have to be where I roll Horde
---
Graciously short, I think it was about 10-15 seconds. The only really bad quests were the Burning Medallion and Zalazane, everything else has been bearable.
---
Its more than disgusting, its atrocious
---
Kromcrush was 6.7k. May be more now.
---
Balancing changes would even be fine, imo. There're a lot of really weird design choices in the game.
---
I think its funny that some people are like "Just log in earlier!". I'm like you know we have this thing called a job...
---
I expected the queues to be better tonight but I guess not
---
I’ve honestly not minded the queues and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time in the game so far.
---
NOICE
---
I think the most legitimate argument to the post is the part about planning ahead with a guild or trying figure out an established character for a server. It becomes a lot harder to do these things when everyone is playing musical chairs.
---
Just focus on leveling until you can start doing instances. You might get a green drop somewhere or from a quest. Get the atlas loot mod to tell you what items drop in instances.
---
More like normies though
---
I went to one of the servers that dropped on release thinking it would be different but the que is still 6+ hours so it really doesn't matter what server you are on
---
Kromcrush was 6.7k; likely more now.
---
It's good to be home

Yes.
---
I’m aware of where they were SUPPOSED to be. They weren’t there.
---
Someone say Devilsaur Mafia?
---
Just to be silly since WOW changed the directory, you’re putting the mods explicitly inside the _classic_-&gt;interface-&gt;Addons right?
---
My mods were not loading because I put them in the old interface folder (inside of Program Files -&gt; World of Warcraft) which it seems works intermittently
---
You knows sh** is real when thr rp servers are full.

---
honestly I haven't had this much fun on a video game for a long time and it's really made me fall in love with WoW again! god bless Classic
---
why did you take a picture of your screen with your phone?
---
I went to enter que early than Windows restarted for stupid update
---
Probably not after they've queued for hours to get in, no.
---
This. The queues  is dropping MUCH slower than yesterday now that everyone has seen what a shitshow it is to get in
---
Going to bed.
---
Troll post is trolling.
---
Then wait and watch some streams or read guides and shit it's better to have some inconvenience now and have decent pops later vs have no queue now and have ghost towns in a month.
---
You know what on that I do agree
---
Supposed to just switch to a new realm every night? Such a bad argument lol
---
Considering that you'd have to go out of your way to get to the Arena when everyone else in the starting zone, you aren't 'discovering' it.  You are purposefully trying to create outrage over a graphic that is 15+ years old and has offended one person, you.
---
I'm sure Blizzard cares deeply that scata444 is offended by this and will be immediately DCing all worlds and freezing all queues until that graphic is replaced.
---
I wish that was me
---
LOL You sure are a salty Blizz shill.
---
They messed up, this is a bad release, get over it. Why are you so emotionally invested in defending a poorly run company?
---
Blizzard: *”We shall double our efforts!”*
---
they need to release all the spare servers, call them herod a, herod b, herod c. fairbanks a, fairbanks b, fairbanks c, etc
---
and say that these servers will be merged when the spike goes down, if the player base stays they will just rename the servers
---
You want that whole dollar back?
---
Lol I haven't played at all yet. Fucking 20k queues suck. It's my own fault though.
---
get an app like TeamViewer
---
F to everyone that is willing to wait those 7k-15k player q to get in. 
---
Id like tonfeee my names on shazzrah , but i cant get on the server :D
---
It will happen one day.
---
In queue now. 8k
---
its also day 2. 
---
you, me and most other people here have paid full price for a "AAA" title that was unplayable at launch.. some times for a week or more. other times the game never delivered on its promise.   
---
i understand your frustration as i am also an adult with a fulltime job, a partner and obligations. But give them sometime to address issues. No one could have guessed the sheer amount of players that dived into WoW Classic in its first few hours. Blizzard are still playing catch ups
---
Lol I wish I was paid by blizzard. That would be nice.
---
Fairbanks was 8500 at 4 PM MST, probably far worse now
---
Stalag is 17k
---
I'm in the exact same position, and I'm going to wait it out
---
Boys need to realize all women fake it a lot ;) don't be so sure you're much better, kiddo.

Scary because they did double it already and it’s not even close to being enough
---
Me as fuck with PW Fortitude
---
This may be the best news I’ve heard in awhile, thank you.
---
I remember this really cool feature that the game used to have, it was called the friends list. Ya know, its funny, because for the first time in probably better than 10 years I started using it again and it feels like home.
---
I can't understand why people hold so much to Herod. Everyone without friends/guild ties should had left long ago.
---
Just tried to log on there but it's got a 4K+ queue right now
---
cu u think u do but u dont
---
I’ve been in queue two hours while at work lol
---
Zandalar tribe Europe?
---
Working fine on Stalagg.
---
i'm down to 956 from 1200 in like 2 hours which is extremely slow, it just doesnt make sense, if people were using exploits then it would've been the same yesterday it's not like everyone decided to turn on their afk macros on the second day for no reason. it has to be some serverside BS
---
Yeah, me and most straight women's ;) https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/02/27/straight-women-are-given-fewest-orgasms-study-finds/#16c08705722d

Your girl falls under this category too, dude. Don't kid yourself otherwise--we're REALLY good at faking and getting you guys to hurry and finish so we can do better things...like play Classic WoW
---
if you are refering to germany you are wrong.
---
Besides thats not nazi related without the context so you are wrong again.
---
Sadly I just announced to my 11 friends on firemaw, that I will be rolling on another server for the next month or so.. we thought we were clever choosing the "new" realm
---
It actually helps though since weapon skills are built up faster
---
Trade war will fuck it up. That’s all you need to know.
---
Same! But it was just a one hour crash from 330-430am.  5 hour energy I want a refund lol
---
&gt; Guzu	Rogue	Horde	26	27/08/19 23:15 (BST)	twitch.tv/guzu
---
They have. There are 5 servers without queue. There are servers with 8+ hour queues
---
Short memories everywhere
---
GET IN A GROUP
---
Apparently their code is bonkers.
---
Some time ago they patched something in a way that made Tempest Keep's Kael'thas go *bald.* I've also seen stuff like waterfalls falling upwards.
---
Shit's weird. I guess the weather vanished together with the second moon and they never figured a way to make it go back without deleting the Horde faction from the game or something like that.
---
Coal miners begrudgingly working, United states, circa 1910.
---
BFA was another expansion to a long running game. Classic was launching a 15 year old MMO that while not the most popular of the games history (WOTLK is arguably) still is loved by many. Helps WoW is the biggest MMO to ever exist.
---
Yeah that’s actually a good point. Didn’t think about the tech as much as of “this is just blizzard they’re always slow in launch of anything”
---
You are free to enjoy it. But when the time comes, and you grow weary of it, remember what you said.
---
Yes. It's in the graphics options menu. Press escape and button is called system iirc
---
Hey,  anyone know how to display incoming heals on the "raid-style party  frames" , or knows of an addon like grid that works for classic and has  the incoming healing functionality working?
---
Looks like I won’t be playing tonight just like last night. Probably will have to wait till the weekend to actually play.
---
Then that low pop becomes high pop tomorrow and then here we are again.
---
There’s a queue now. A half hour. Thats what it was last night too. I’m not too worried about that far ahead. I want to play now. I’ll just hope it stays healthy and/or Blizzard offers transfers or merges realms. My friends are with me so it works. I know there’s one popular streamer who’s name escapes me on here too. It’s not the streamer realm, but he switched to it after yesterday’s long queues.
---
People are afk auto-running into walls in Inns. There were like 30 in Brill on Stalagg.
---
I'm alliance. We get a 4 slot when you get into westfall but I haven't gotten there yet.
---
yes
---
Yup, C:/Program Files(x86)/World of Warcraft/classic/Interface/Addons. That’s where the twitch app installs them to and where I tried manually unzipping to.
---
They cost too much mana. You'll go oom after three casts.
---
I’ve been fighting disconnecting while still in queue. I was able to relog quickly and get my spot back but a small delay finally put me back at the end of the line. 
---
I read about disabling hardware acceleration on the battle.net app which also seemed to disconnect at the same time. All other ping and packet loss was fine. 
---
So far I’ve gone 5 mins in queue without dcing. I’m cautiously optimistic.
---
I fucked up. I got connected early a few hours ago and got in way faster than anticipated so I actually DCed and had to relog, now I’m 2 hours deep in queue and might get to play some time tonight lol
---
thats not a name reservation then lol
---
Sulfuras is a 4 hour que now? Damn, I was hoping that it wasnt going to get as bad as the others. No ques at all last night. Got d/c after an hour and thought my night was over, but got logged back in instantly.
---
They really should open a few more and let people know if there will be transfers or not
---
To be specific, they drop an item which starts a quest. They do not drop an item which is the objective of a quest.
---
I am not the general chat is already going all in on talking about politics.
---
&gt;Not sure thats a blizzard problem.
---
The fact that, in the meanwhile, the amount of servers have more than quadrupled while still having long queues shows how they are clearly wrong with their assumptions and own calculations. 
---
No, it's not a Blizzard problem. But it is clearly a problem. And one that could have been prevented by Blizzard.
---
It's again the "we know better" attitude.
---
Imagine if they hadn't added any servers at all. But they did. 4 times the amount. And that is clearly indicative that they were wrong about the popularity.
---
Switch realms.
---
Don't get why it wouldn't just go the other way.
---
Why not just open the gates and merge later?
---
The reason is the cost of virtualization servers I'm sure and might have a contracted lease time, so Blizzard is just being stingy cause Activision pays bonuses for good numbers.
---
lol, that's beautiful!
---
cost?
---
I have a spread of characters across several pve and pvp servers. Having a goal of every class to 60 means I at LEAST use two different servers, but I went with 4 (so far).
---
Shhhhh don’t tell
---
Google about for mobile remote desktop.  Varies slightly for android/iphone.      
---
Start queue at work via phone, time it so that you only wait a bit when you get home.    
---
Things may calm down in the coming weeks.  Best of luck.
---
yeah, it's just bit harder to time with video games if you need a quick screen capture
---
I make a macro for roots that cancels everything.
---
Logged back into retail. The guy deleted his comment about how people where ditching classic.
---
Yeah this launch has been pretty interesting
---
There actually used to be a feature that allowed you to control weather intensity, at some point it was removed and the default was set to the lowest setting. 
---
Even in the 'weather 2.0' you can see in BFA alpha footage the weather isn't as strong as it is in the screenshot.
---
Yes, leveling is one part of the game.  His response to me not liking one part of the game is to say I'm doomed to quit.  
---
I don't understand that mindset.  
---
Where is the confusion?
---
I deleted it
---
So heres all the add on's i have, from a list that someone recommended. 
---
When I use buffs, they appear there in the video. Which is kinda in the way. Is there a way to move that? Im not even sure which add on is doing it.
---
YEAH BFA IS SHIT
---
Remember your debt when it comes time to pick a healer for 60 dungeons.
---
Same. And all my names are taken in another regional server. I'm just gonna wait it out and play for as long as I'm waiting .
---
google remote desktop is free and pretty easy to setup.
---
Which is exactly why I joined Herod. Have I been queued all day? Yes. Will it be the best PVP server ever in Classic and long term healthy? Yes.
---
V lookup is for apprentices. Index- match is archmage.
---
Of course they would, it seems like servers only hold 3 or 4 layers at a time, the amount of people from Herod's queue alone would fill 2 servers.
---
Why would they need queues and long wait times to show that when they literally have the actual subscription and login numbers they can use?  Long queues show incompetence more than a demand for their product.
---
Shareholders care about quarterly profits. It is spiking because the buzz surrounding the launch hints at positive growth, them introducing artificial waits would likely drive away subs (or shorten subs) which would only hurt reported gains.
---
Same boat on Faerlina, went down from 2200 to 2100 in an hour. compared to the 16k to 4k in 3hrs
---
That was latency friend, this beta was probably Blizzard's highest tested product ever. And they told us why they were doing this, we won't know it they're right for a month. They could be wrong and you can ride into the sunset with your head held high but this was purposeful.
---
i mean everything in this picture is right, sorry but 10 hours queu time for a tripple A compagny is not acceptable
---
Probably running on pure adrenaline at this point. I can't blame them.
---
Nice
---
yupp. wasn’t an issue
---
No, shards wouldn't do any good bc its still the same amount of players on the server, they're just more spread out. It's not about how spread out they are, it's about every one of the shards being full. If they just made servers bigger it could become a laggy mess and feel overpopulated when they combined them in Phase 2, if you know what i mean?
---
OCD on my part, also I’m not in a mad rush to 60 so it was fun to experience the big crowds even if it meant super slow levelling.
---
Underrated post. 10/10

Ya its easy and called Shadow.
---
"Evidently"? What's the evidence?
---
I think
---
You can switch characters *on the same realm* yes
---
Pretty sure they patrol all the way from ashenvale to dustwallow. It's a huge route. They're hard to find even if you're looking for them.
---
aslong as its on the same server youre good
---
I mean it sounds like trolling but lots of people are going to hate classic leveling.
---
Hello old school Emerald Dreamer!
---
Nice flex. -_-
---
No, the people parroting that line don't look. They just try to shit on anyone mentioning the queues.
---
No, you can go back to the character selection screen without logging out
---
Finally under 10k after 3 hours lol
---
My buddy who logged in around noon pst said our server, fairbanks, was showing medium and he was put into a 20 person queue for what its worth.
---
Dont worry about being alone. I guarantee you by the time you reach lvl 10 your friendlist wont be empty
---
Literally me right now
---
All servers are full besides like three and one of those is high lol (US Server)
---
yeah, seems like you guys are stuck unless the whole guild decides to reroll.  i guess at least im not in a guild yet. good luck.
---
8:30, and I'm only at 320.  I'd morbidly curios to see if doing regular restarts would fix the queues.  Increasingly convinced that a not small portion of the playerbase are using things like macro keyboards to stay logged in.
---
For real.  I guess I should just go fuck myself since I get up at 4 am for the gym and and typically get home at 8 pm in the evening.
---
All I want is to unwind for a single hour each night.  Too bad the queues are 7000 people and take 4+ hours.
---
He's genuinely ungenuine.  That's what gets him clicks.
---
That's not true and I'm not sure why you'd think that. Some people play characters but they're normally pretty open about it. This guy isn't doing that and it's kind of strange you're using that as a way to defend his shitty behavior. Just because his shitty behavior also gets his fans riled up doesn't mean it's an act.
---
I don't think it was that bad. I was logged in around 4PST for maybe an hour and a half before the big crash that dumped everyone. People were pretty polite despite competing for mobs and quest loots. I guess if you're in a big hurry it could have been annoying...
---
OMFG  CANT STOP LAUGHING   THIS IS THE BEST QUALITY POST IVE SEEN IN YEARS
---
Kara..with crypts
---
Last night for NA Whitemane I waited 8.5 hour queue, got in and 4 min later got randomly dc from the server.
---
/r/wow is thataway -----&gt;&gt;
---
Listen, the anticipation is far better than the actual product. Blizz knows whats up.
---
I pressed change realm earlier by mistake after sitting in queue for ~3 hours. I quickly clicked the realm again and I was put back on my position, I briefly saw the total queue before I was put back. I did this twice just to confirm
---
Oblivious. Definitely Alliance player.
---
Well in this instance the 10 dollars is for unlimited pizza for an entire month, with the stated caveat that your pizza will be heavily delayed the first few days to a week. 
---
I think most people would take that deal happily
---
I'm on old blanchy Hes a nic e old fella
---
This is true, but I don't think it was viable for them to add large amounts of non-linear content for the expansions. I don't think it was possible for the leveling playstyle of vanilla to survive any expanding. As soon as BC launched, so much of the old world became pointless, like professions and reputations, replaced by a necessarily streamlined thing (because they can't produce nearly as much content in n expansion.)
---
You overheal and run out of mana super fast. You need to downrank heals based on how much your target actually needs to be healed.
---
You definitely have a type.
---
I got onto the only oceanic pvp server no problem with some planning with another bloke. 8 hours later the other 8 people that couldn’t make it rolled on the new one they gave us. I left my level 15 to roll there, the other bloke I was leveling with cracked the sads and pretty much quit. 
---
3 of the others quit because they couldn’t handle competing for mobs. We done better then 50% in yesterday’s shit show. Not too bad I think.
---
it shouldn't matter to you whether your faction is less popular than the opposing faction. on one hand, your faction is an almighty conquering entity; on the other, your faction is the underdog hero waiting to save the day. in theory most servers will have the same rates, but play on grobbulus, it is the best server
---
They are trickling out servers, hasn't helped so far and they haven't said anything else on the subject.
---
was a low pop earlier today with no queue
---
*cries in Herod*
---
The subscription is blended with their retail accounts. How could they know the demand for the new product? This is the perfect way to show they have a new cash cow
---
PRINTSCREEN
---
Yeah. We could.
---
I had my wife Que me up at 1pm hoping I can play by the time dinners done :(
---
So let players that are willing transfer their characters to a new server. It goes against marketing principles to ask consumers to start over and over again...
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Lmfao you cancelled your sub because there is queues on launch? Idk why I'm even surprised. Sure, the queues absolutely suck and are a huge let down considering I work a shit ton and can't just sit at home and join the queue, but that's just being a whiny little brat.
---
You downvote me, but seriously.  Not trolling....been doing it since noon tday.
---
No.
---
They can increase the sharding/layering. They are intentionally not increasing it to push people to less populated servers. Your idea is a convoluted way to just increase the number of shards/layers they are stacking on a server. They have stated that they have it capped far below any technical limitation to push people to less populated servers.
---
thank you for your contribution to classic, layer supporter, i hope you are enjoying the queues
---
4 hours? you are being generous..
---
Yes !! I love my predator ! :). What specs do you have ?
---
People **pay** for a service and expect that service to work as expected.
---
I been sitting here and finally found the lowest PVE Queue (Westfall) and I still have a 45 minute wait lol :(
---
Most people would say that that's what friends are for but I guess in your case an additional $15 does the trick.
---
Needs the beta level of nighttime though
---
How is it flexing if I’m telling you there are servers right now you can get into, instead of crying that you waited all night probably trying to get into a streamer server or some shit
---
The main guy literally said they didnt add more servers to start because they "assume" people will stop playing. Which might be true to an extent. But you're going to lose so many more players due to being unable to fucking play. They have the ability to do server transfers. Open up servers, allotnof them, then if the population dies down, offer up free transfers once the population stabilizes. Problem solved. But nope, let's make the problem worse by being lazy as fuck right at the beginning. Its completely asinine and I cant believe they would do this knowing damn good and well how popular the game was going to be. There is no excuse outside of they dont give a fuck about their game anymore or the players.
---
Meanwhile people saying afk macros are bannable. zzz
---
I ran into an hour-long queue about 3 hours after the servers came online, but no wait longer than 5 minutes other than that. And I’ve logged in 5 times. West Coast US.
---
Did the same thing
---
Queues are like 4-7hrs work is longer you will get booted for afk
---
Ah, good idea
---
Ew
---
Interface -&gt; camera -&gt; max camera distance
---
Queue times of 7+ hours is insane and seeing how dead Retail servers got, no one wants to reroll on one of the lower pop realms.
---
I'm joining ya over there. Horde or Alliance?
---
Herod
---
See I don't get this. 1-10 you can literally just auto attack kite mobs and kill them pretty easily as long as u are timing it well. What's supposedly hard?
---
Remember how people argued that layering was an alternative to having log in queues? Man, do I have a bridge to sell those people.
---
yeah but there were not a lot of servers to choose from if you wanted to plan with a guild or friends
---
Thanks a bunch :)
---
Main reason I go Druid honestly is I like tanking dungeons. Rogue and Dps classes in general feel quite superfluous, whereas healer but mostly tank feels important and vital. 
---
Darkshore really is a nice zone so far. Lots of beasts, herbs and 3 quests that require fishing. Has it all really.

the lowest pop server yesterday was Blooodsail Buccaneers and it had a 10 minutes queue
---
I missed the queues completely this morning and last night until my girlfriend made me go get food with her, now I’m stuck waiting for 4 hours

Im pretty sure you agreed to this sort of thing when you accepted the terms and conditions. I may be wrong but if not, you have no right to complain.

Tip #3: Don’t sleep

Im suprised your friend remembers classic leveling health and mana regeneration rates.
---
I sure can't
---
i work from 1600 to 0000 monday thru friday so thankfully i never dealt with the queue times.
---
In the time it took me to type this message, they've added two more including the awesomely named Thunderfury PvP pretty much just as the last one from an hour ago hit High Pop. I think we can count on them doing that regularly until things normalize.
---
That's irrelevant. I was simply pointing out I was correct that launch day would be a shit show
---
Get on Tuk’s forums and post it in support for classic.
---
Aight
---
You can't do that because the servers eventually need to be down to 1 layer.
---
When will guild banks release?
---
Gnomes are the best rogues.  So fun to beat expectations with them.
---
I’m glad I switched to Sulfuras after I got DC and put in queue last night. I haven’t seen a queue since
---
Can anyone explain why you wouod wait in a 5 hour login queue to wait in another line for mobs?
---
People don't log out, if you move up a spot it is because someone gave up
---
But that's stupid, there are other ways to handle this without making people sit in queues that start at 16k.
---
knocked 1000 people off skeram queue, lets open more realms

What’s stopping you from retiring at 60 exactly?

If 15 dollars a month is a problem you need a job

Pretty much. I expected queues don’t get me wrong, but fuck.

The sex number

Im playing civ 6 while i wait

You can watch it on Amazon Prime Videos, and its absolutely worth watching. Its only 8 episodes long and is worth the ride.
---
dear heart, i have not found a server without a que in NA. even the ones they put up less than 12 hours ago. stalagg is my ride or die now cuz i've jumped around so much figured might as well just pick my poison im most familiar with and hope for better days to come.
---
Vet what ya doin, I didn't know you played wow even 😉
---
Literally me 1 minute ago on Gehennas EU. Server is shutting down in 10 minutes. Oh well time to sleep
---
They added a pvp server for East an hour ago and its not full yet. They also just added a pvp server for PST literally 5min ago and its called Thunderfury which is awesome.
---
I haven’t lagged yet.
---
Stream? Social Links?
---
I'll try to tomorrow. At the moment I'm logged out (firemaw eu) after a 25 hour play session.
---
Pretty sure a shaman named Mute was 29 before he logged out and there was a hunter (cahey??) who was nearing 30 as well. Maybe already passed it.
---
I'll look tomorrow after work and provide the needed screenshots for proof.
---
But easily a handful that are above 25.

*grabs popcorn*

In honesty, the signal was way to unstable to actually work. I never really got to test that out but I would imagine not.

It's insane that we have to come up with solutions like this to beat the system so we can play a game we are paying for.

I'm on Herod

I remember talking on forums just a year ago and people were speculation we would only need 3 servers, one pvp one pve and one rp

But there was no stated caveat when I paid for the service. If there was a warning that said to expect delays I may have waited a month to resub
---
Re-reading Hickman’s avengers run 👌👌
---
Shaman if you understand what your doing
---
Yeah I took time off, thinking surely five days is enough for Blizzard to have their shit together on a 13 year old game launch process. 
---
Fucking nope.
---
I agree it's atrocious. Been stuck on "27 mins" and my position in queue hasn't budged. I was already booted from queue earlier too it's fucking nuts.
---
That seems completely believable. Assuming peak concurrent is in the neighborhood of 2x mean concurrent then that would put mean time played per day at 1.2/12\*24/2=1.2hours. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Most numbers I can find seem to put mean time/week spent playing video games (among teen boys who play video games, the dominant demographic in question) at around 7-8 hours/week which would seem to line up. I'm honestly surprised peak concurrent was that high given that WoW's subscriber base doesn't consist entirely of teen boys, which should pull the average down even further, but my 2x peak:mean ratio assumption is probably off.

That's right Ashley-Lynn, it's just a name.

Why not just wait a week or two and see if you can get in then?

there's other solutions to that as well.  xrealm type name-server.  realm groups that are pre-determined to merge which all share a name database.

Yeah ...Wrath baby here.

---
I don't see why Blizzard and all the shills posting in this forum expects the entire playerbase to fix a problem that they didn't create.
---
Blizz messed up their release, and underestimated players by an order of magnitude. The least they can do is stop blaming players for being "stubborn" when they merely want to stick with friends/names/guilds. It is time to stop blaming the customer and time to start fixing this mess they created.

kromcrush has a 3.5k queue right now :d

More servers cost more money. They're not just going to throw money at it willy-nilly when the population will likely die down in a week.

I never once said I was crying wat? This is a real Tutorial on the World of Queue, and how to maximize level efficiency
---
Most people couldn't even get in till like midnight.    But even so, who cares?   If you stay, you will spend thousands of hours playing.
---
I'm spending it at work...I jumped in the queue at lunch yesterday and only had to wait 2 hours once I got home
---
And then you queue up ingame for the unique quest mob spawns.
---
One ring to find them...
---
I welcome all the buffs
---
sir this is a /r/politics drive-through.
---
This is perfect
---
The line should be for groups of 5. 
---
ALWAYS BE IN A FULL GROUP FOR THESE QUESTS AND TELL OTHERS TO DO SO AS WELL. 
---
5 people can do it for each spawn, so the line goes by 5 times as fast.
---
Blizzard dropped the ball big time with this but we all knew they were going to.
---
This is a "You think you do but you don't" and it's blizzard thinking they know what players want but they don't have a fucking clue.
---
Yes. But this photo was taken on classic. And his classic goldfarming isn't used to buy tokens. 
---
This multibox farm is made to sell the accounts / pvp / goldfarm for himself or whatever reason, anything else but farming tokens on classic.
---
Dumbass...
---
Along with other classics such as 'don't you guys have phones?'
---
For real though I'm just happy they reconsidered and made it :)
---
Jesus. Just skip the quest at this point
---
Weird because it worked before.
---
Why don't they open up more servers and offer free transfers?
---
Boy am I glad I have friends that agreed t bail on a realm twice until we coined a healthy server without outrageous queue times. I’ll take my half hour-an hour waits in Kirtonos over your struggle.
---
So you're in favor of tons of server merges that destroy any semblance of server community instead?

Or you know you could change servers?

Hello Everyone I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders, a casual Family-oriented guild recruiting for Classic.
---
**Our Goal**: Provide a guild for people that have kids, work 50+ hours a week, and have other real life responsibilities that keep them from joining a hardcore guild. We aim to complete all end-game content whether it is PvP or PvE related, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals in classic we would be delighted to help you achieve them.
---
**Server**: Herod, PvP, EST
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
Raid times: Friday and Saturday 9pm to 12am EST
---
Website: &lt;bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.(com)&gt;
---
if interested, you can reach me on my battletag: Soulmauler#1583, or on Discord: Soul#6978. If I manage to get in game look for Soulhoof
---
They do, the whole thex meme that rolled over classic Reddit they knew about. So they do read this. They have even commented about reading things on Reddit.
---
Nah its just there has been so much crying about the que lately.
---
Red means population, not type. Of course you gotta play pvp :)
---
It's for maintenance, people on my server were saying it's to fix the queues lol.
---
Atiesh had no queue at any point this morning. 
---
I mean... YES MY SERVER IS BAD TOO... stay away...
---
Not for me, I restarted my game because of microstutters and on Zandalar Tribe - EU I instantly got in, theres either protection for a small amount of time or there were no queues.
---
If your on herod can just use the guilds of Herod Discord: https://discord.gg/YmEnjmm
---
Well that's good to hear.  I remember quest items like that being a huge pain on some private servers when they went fresh.
---
That's assuming everyone trying it out now will be playing in 3 months. That's a hefty assumption. They're trying to spread the playerbase now so layer disabling will be smoother, some will be a little harder than others but they seem to have a decent plan.
---
Sir, you just described the internet
---
Theres a que but they are a lot better on some of the new servers.  Rattlegore didn't have a que all day while most of the older ones did and it didn't have a que until about \~2 hrs ago and even then it actually moves and is less than an hour still.
---
My friend group decided to join bc it was one of the few PvP servers that didn’t have any or as many streamers on it
---
Kinda. Mostly likely he makes a decision based on his main client, but one has to be aware of how that decision affects other clients.
---
Example, when he wants to cast a spell, he can press 1 and all other clients press 1. Essentially he made a decision on his main  to cast a spell and wants the other clients to do the same.
---
However, say he wants to loot a mob. He can either line his characters perfectly (which takes a lot of work) and then cast a mouse click to clients to loot the mob, but most likely he goes to each client individually and loots by hand as the first method is very prone to errors, and in classic there is only individual loot.
---
Botting is simply having a program make it's own decision and performs actions based on it , where as multiboxing, you still have to make the decisions and perform the actions (aka press buttons).
---
Hope this explains it a little.
---
Dont forget about the undead defilers in arathi
---
It's only been out like a day. You will be addicted to this game for years, don't worry your crack is almost here.
---
What did you do last week when the game wasn’t available yet? 
---
Come man man I know you know how to kill time waiting for something.
---
Ya I stopped believing the estimated time when it took an hour to go from 50 min to 49 min. Also at one point it was telling me &lt;1 min with around 2k still in front of me lol
---
the same amount of space for players that a few layered realms fit, just separated and encouraging short queues.  also completely vanilla-like.
---
It requires you to open sniping tool, that’s a program. Windows+Shift+S lets you just paste it anywhere, opening a program is optional.
---
Yeah found out the hard way. No queue yesterday, 3h today. Definitely setting up teamviewer now.

How many of those WoW streams were just chatting while waiting in queue
---
Uhh no it’s fine
---
Server cap in 2006 was either 5 or 6k, no?
---
Queues on servers new yesterday were in excess of 2006 total pop...so... how many multiples of servers do we need now to ensure we have the quality of community’s we had back then?

At least double and more likely quadrupole seems to be right.

They've opened like 20 servers in the last 2 days dude. 2 less than 2 hours ago.

I love the mutual help offered all over the place. When questing is moderately hard, everyone needs a hand here and there and you offer because someone offered you and will again.
---
It’s a very healthy social dynamic that doesn’t exist in the later expansions because nobody needs help with anything.

This only applies to abilities that use mana.

Playing = long Q times

No idea what he's on about

I logged into a med pop server. Still has a 7k que so there labeling means nothing.

---
4 hours? Living the life of luxury over there I see, on Firemaw it was 9-10hours today.
---
And it's down again , fkn LOL at least i got to lv 8
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Server shutdown is in 2 mins buddy :(
---
They're all mages.  He's going to create a portal Network. You forget how hard it is to get around and in classic. Buying ports is huge.
---
it will kick you from classic
---
I'm not sure where you're getting these marketing principles from. And they already have your money, they don't care if you're playing or not.
---
if it helps at all hunter counters rogue in pvp
---
I haven't had this issue
---
Get back from work to play, queue until you need to go to sleep. At this point I should really just combine my queuing and sleep and just wake up early to play.
---
worst launch ever?
---
I literally just went 1-10. Max range Auto attack, serpent instantly, run away a few steps auto, few steps, auto, mob dead. When you're around 7-10, you need to add in raptor strike to finish. That's how every single fight went
---
There was a point where that was the case, but since this is 1.12 based they SHOULD be in the capital
---
That literally isn't what layers are. Layers don't increase the maximum player cap at all. What they do is separate the players into worldwide shards so people can actually play the game. Remember how the starting zone was? that would have been 10x worse and what we actually got would have been the rest of the world.
---
Actually think gotw and thorns are my most used spells by far 😄 all that gratitude /epeen
---
15 years later Blizzard still isn't prepared for Vanilla WoW.  We put a man on the moon but Blizzard with 100 times the budget can't put a man in a video game.
---
My buddy and I screen shared on discord then Snapchat call the other person...
---
I've server hopped 3 time now, each time attaining a level 8 - 10 character. Every time I invest in a server, the queue times render it unplayable. Jeez this is so disappointing.
---
I had no problem kiting mobs until 10-20% hp and finish them off with 1 raptor strike.
---
Literally just set this up, will be getting in queue much sooner tomorrow
---
THAT'S why my queue dropped 2k so fast
---
How so
---
No hahah I saw it in your pic
---
You guys don't like it when the women pull the same kind of snarky "Sorry babe, I'm busy today" shit back on you, I guess ;)
---
Every private server I played on had unplayable lag or pay to win mechanics, or both.
---
Classic just has huge queue times for me so far. Like 8+ hours to play each night after work.
---
Oh hey, a sailboat.
---
Please tell me you play horde on Kromcrush
---
Just bring up the app on your phone every 10 mins and press W to knock afk off
---
Not really, Anduins dad was missing and he was in charge. Bolvar was just like a hand of the king who protected Anduin.
---
it's like 30 kb/s depending on what's going on around you
---
My realm (can’t remember off top) has no queues
---
Not if you want to raid. Retail raiding and Mythic+ dungeons are much more intense than what Classic dishes out.
---
Happy Birthday and happy Classic launch to you:). May your journey bring you joy and a shitload of epics!
---
I did actually enjoy the queue today because I had work to do. But tomorrow, I don't want to wait 6 hours plz.
---
If you log out or DC you get 5 min to log back in. This has been broken for some people and working for others. What I expect is people dc and log back in and so the count goes down then back up.
---
We all are.
---
That sounds like it is not properly connected to the motherboard?
---
I do
---
O ya Classic is a breeze! I recommend not using the paths to travel as the off path routes are quicker and usually very safe
---
Crazy, thats where I settled and haven’t waited yet.  Looks like a wait now
---
Seriously... they need more servers. These queue times aren’t okay. I rolled on Bigglesworth and had no que time this morning. Returning from class it’s at four hours.
---
My pc won't be here til September 13 or sooner....... can..not...cope....
---
only PvP servers btw!
---
They’re under the assumption he’s not trying to profit on these accounts you fucking toothpick brain
---
Negative. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news (or good?).
---
uhh .. botting?
---
*Snickers in razer*
---
It's gonna take Blizzard some time but they'll sort it out.
---
Ok, but how does that entail that we can't have "overuse" layers for launch day/week?  I think if you polled the entire player base right now whether they'd rather A) log into the game and maybe not run into the same player that often, or B) not log into the game, you'd get a pretty resounding A.
---
Rattlegore baby! My home away from Herod.
---
The server is like a room, you can fill the room with people but only so many can go through the door at once.  From the queue numbers it looks like it makes a layer fills it and takes awhile to make another layer.
---
I’m actually happy I STILL haven’t subbed yet. Lmao. The up &amp; down, back &amp; forth in the subreddit is bonkers.
---
Eventually I will play. But at least I’m smart enough to wait and see these days.
---
Varian Wrynn is currently missing under mysterious circumstances. He left on a diplomatic mission but didn't come back. So Anduin is in fact king in his stead.
---
Two more then!
---
And 2 after that!
---
People are nicer
---
You know resilience doesn't exist anymore, right? Raiding and PvP gear are interchangeable.
---
#TIL: THERE IS A CITY CALLED IRONFORGE
---
You're probably right. They should though, so many bootlickers here.
---
Did that, also youtubed it. And I played with the circles. Couldn't get anywhere lol. The circles are questie, damage meter, and dominos btw.
---
Okay what do they do with those servers when population dwindles?
---
When do they decide hey fuck it let's mash it together?
---
What do they give to the people on the server to swap?
---
What do they do about the people who don't want to swap?
---
These people on reddit who think their 1 sentence solutions are better than Blizzard outstand me since they only have the mental capacity to think in a vaccuum and don't realize the bigger implications of what's going on. MMO launches have always been heavily plagued by issues and so it's asinine to act like it's some easy feat. 
---
The most annoying thing is that Blizzard has ALREADY figured out how to make smooth launches, with BfA being one of the smoothest releases I've ever played on. Unfortunately, the solutions they use such as sharding, scaling world, and cross realm zones, are vehemently hated by this subreddit and for good reason.
---
Is EU back?
---
Be nice. OP put in the same effort blizzard has
---
And almost anyone would trade with you their own queue times
---
I guess it would work, wow checks what other programs you have open I think, so it would just see teamviewer.exe.
---
You have your macro running in the hose
---
I actually engaged 2nd gear on the countdown. That's right, I switched into 2nd gear before the servers went up.
---
Consolidating servers is way more destructive than a couple days of long queues. Boomers should have taken next week off lol.
---
Let me get this straight. You waited more than 10 years for a freebie noob shield?
---
Damaging a mob with Agony didn't tag it for me.  
---
did 10% damage &amp; a warrior hits it &amp; steals it from me. 10/10 game!
---
Which server are you able to play on? I may be joining you lol.
---
You could just hit the queue, go to the gym and come back and still be in the queue.
---
Yes. That someone is you.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
28 minutes left? ..
---
Thank you
---
I've given up trying to play until after labor Day.  There are worse things than having to wait a few extra days to play your favorite game.
---
What’s even the point at that point?
---
Blizzard went dark on subscriptions forever ago so that's not new.
---
Private servers were largely what Vanilla was at launch in 2004 in terms of mob.difficulty, but not what it was at their target patch (1.12) in 2006.
---
So, Classic is truer to 1.12 (2006) but most private servers were truer to 1.1 (2004) in this one aspect.
---
You got it, that translates to roughly 0.11 GB per hour. (So my first estimation was a little off)
---
Gotta indoctrinate them young!:)
---
Similar thing happened to me. Currently waiting to get into Rattlegore at 4k in que
---
I was flying to tb with this q and the servers were restarting but I could just turn it in after the server came up again.
---
damn
---
What keyboard is that? :o
---
Just move to the next quest lol
---
Damn. Nice
---
+
---
Awesome. Enjoy doing the exact same thing all over again next time you log on.
---
That’s worst than space mountain...
---
Launch week is going to be crazy. Why couldn't people wait another week before making a 2 year long decision. The queues will be gone by next week.
---
10 min
---
For Windfury, you want the slowest speed possible, 3.60 or more ideally. This is because the WF attacks happen instantly and use your weapon damage, disregarding the speed. It's the most efficient and bursty damage output.
---
This is the exact correct solution to this problem. The only thing they would need to do is make names unique across these server subsets.
---
We almost all agree that queues now are better than dead servers in the future. The only reason queues need to exist, however,  is because blizzard failed to architect properly.
---
Right, we chose a server on a whim. Then switched to East Coast since we're Central, found out we picked Herod without knowing what that meant, then got in touch with old friends who are coming back and said to join them. So, we did, which turned out to be Stalagg, but now we're all committed.
---
We really didn't care where we ended up, just that it was all together. We just ended up committing to a realm that filled up fast.
---
I was sitting in a 7hr queue on Arugal, when they dropped Yas. So i jumped into Yas, got to lvl 10 all good....  
---
but now i hear similar queues are in place on Yas.... /themfeels
---
I never got to max level playing from vanilla to wotlk, and I loved every bit of it.
---
I levelled as holy priest, dammit, and I enjoyed it, dammit!
---
Damn, I guess you're right. I should delete the other 30 games on my PC that I was able to play within' 48 hours of purchasing them.
---
Wtf man classic is the best game and this community is the best in the world bro crigne bro
---
[Wow, thanks!](https://imgur.com/W9PQ3s2)
---
Which one you on now? Looking for people to play with
---
The classic experience is a marathon, not a sprint. You will much prefer playing when things calm down.
---
that video is amazing !
---
Ahhhh twinks....simplified pvp at its finest!
---
there is always bad fruit don't let it spoil your day!
---
Cause im already level 6 on my main
---
Ive progress too far to restart
---
More opinions on best pacific server?
---
Maybe the queues wouldn't be 12 hours if so many people weren't doing this
---
My parents sat and watched me jumping at a wall in stormwind for 3 hours once, they thought there was something wrong with me.
---
Little did they know.
---
Parkour.
---
Why wouldn't you just walk there while dead and then spirit rez at the gy in blasted lands?
---
Right is right!
---
Pretty difficult to convince my 100+ guild members who have been logged in since launch to switch realms at this point
---
&gt; They won't keep up a realm that is dead
---
Considering how they handle servers on retail this is just blatantly false
---
It said it would be down for an hour in the login screen.
---
Not enough queue timers
---
We did silly things back then, too.
---
* /console WeatherDensity 0 (Turns weather effects off.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 1 (Low intensity.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 2 (More intense.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 3 (Heavy weather effects.)
---
It will be interesting to see how the numbers change over time. I'm sure that the novelty will wear off for some, just not sure how many.
---
Swing Trading Intensifies
---
&gt; just open fucking 20 more servers everywhere and then merge them together later.
---
how do you merge them?
---
What server are they playing on? The majority of people are prolly getting bottlenecked on certain “starter” quests and the ones who can get ahead most likely have no competition or at least a small amount
---
Great movie
---
Vanilla wasn't like that. It looked like ass and still chugged. The graphics engine has come a long way.
---
You're*
---
Queues...its almost all the queues, which is temporary
---
Whoever logs in first after the merge
---
Also *F is for friends who queue up together* for a similar syllable count.
---
Moohooves*
---
And someone will make autoclicker so he just go afk for 20 min, so he wouldn't wait 4 hours to enter again.
---
Thank you very much for the advice
---
Sadly my computer cannot download the game xD but this game does still grab my interest. Nonetheless, very good advice that you have given me.
---
I dunno I can't beat the login queue raid boss.
---
Not gonna read through the comments to see if others did it but I just streamed my login screen to twitch and had it open on my iPad while I napped
---
You have a long way to go. That 40-60 slog is no joke.
---
Yeah, especially when the world is so populated many challenging things are negated just due to all the warm bodies around!
---
Them mixing the sub makes it ambiguous whether one or the other is lacking in growth, making both look in a healthy state.

   * *Developers’ note: This system now measures each realm against a realm’s absolute capacity. Medium indicates a healthy total population on a realm—well in excess of what we considered Full in 2006—with room for more players to log-in. You’ll now see a High label if the realm is close to having a queue, and a Full label if the realm currently has a queue.*

Imagine thinking that is a "grown up choice"
---
This
---
Level 6 lol
---
Yeah great roll playing opportunities when 200 people are waiting in a single file line to spawn camp a supposedly dangerous monster terrorizing the village.
---
Y'all are hilarious.
---
No day one launch has been smooth for any mmo ever. There will be problems. There will be queues. Especially with THE most popular mmo.
---
Lower your expectations for the first few days. If you have 4 hour queues a week in, sure, complain away. Until then, sit down.
---
I used TeamViewer while at work and the damn queue finished before I got home, playing wow over TeamViewer is worse than playing coked out of your mind, camera controls are impossible and you can't even keyboard turn.
---
I'm doing it again today.

---
There are a number of things negatively impacted by flying.
---
Yes. Put it on 3 and it says classic.
---
Fairbanks. There’s currently an 8k+ que to get in but my friends are saying it’s dead
---
My friend just go home from work and has a four minute queue. 
---
Try a different realm?
---
Worrying about 4chan. It really is 2004/5 all over again! I can’t blame you
---
They are fast on their feet for such a big company.  I expect like a week or so before they switch things up somehow or another...maybe a couple days even.  Just a guess tho.
---
Already posted 10 times and the mods deleted 9 of them
---
I'd say about a week before things stabilize.  Maybe sooner if blizzard gets their head out of their asses and increases the layer and server cap sizes.
---
That is one of the reason queues stay long and don't move. People stay logged in because they want to avoid queues, but them staying logged in is part of what makes the queues so long.
---
&gt; there is no inherent advantage to multiboxing.
---
they are using 3pp to sync all their actions, that alone should be against tos...
---
With those 7 hour ques you prob had never time to play the game. If you couldn't take the hint that the big servers were gonna have massive ques and that you need to relocate sooner or later than thats up to you guys.
---
What would you propose they do differently? Like, they seem to have addressed your criticism in this very post. How would you respond to their characterization?
---
Well guys on a flip side we all can agree that wow classic had a very succesfull launch (in terms of numbers that is). Gotta see the bright side first xD
---
[deleted]
---
Yea didn't think they'd be back up so quickly. Was trying to make it before shutdown.
---
Just contact support
---
&gt; Activision has been in charge for 10 years lol. WHen did you think WoW came out, 1992?
---
WoW came out about 4 years before the Activision merger, so I'd say a policy that has been in place since launch has basically nothing to do with Activision.
---
How is that lying? The queue time is indeed greater than 1 minute.
---
If next week is a repeat of how this week has been so far I don’t know how long I’ll stay subbed. Don’t want to pay for a game I can only get on and play during the weekend because I can get up early in the AM to beat the queue hopefully.
---
Thats your own fault but ok
---
liar
---
And ban every account with stupid out of context comparisons!
---
If only people like you didn’t defend blizzard when they are being complete trash, then the company might not be in such a shit bad place
---
Oh wait...
---
Sounds pretty "disruptive" to the community.

---
Yes
---
\#Ban the 1%
---
They can detect those low key macro programs.  Those will get you banned because one key press wasnt one ability.
---
And your solution to the queue is for everyone to jam it up and let no one new in?
---
It'll depend on your class. If you're a caster or healer, make sure you have enough water to drink. If you're a dps or tank, make sure your gear isn't close to being broken. If you're a hunter, make sure you have enough ammo and pet food. Save up any health potions and bandages you have. Always assist the tank and attack what he's attacking.
---
Thanks about it, have fun!
---
Top underrated comment, tops off to you good sir.
---
For a second i thought you got flying..
---
I actually never played vanilla, because never ever could I get my parents to pay monthly for a game.
---
But with the right people it truly can be a experience, too bad some of us aren't that young anymore to play as much.
---
I'm gonna go casual from now too but still a very pleasant surprise for me, happy it was the same for you too
---
Also Locks and probs pallies won’t even get their class mounts til DM lol.
---
I hope Matt and Trey are enjoying classic, or sitting in que with the rest of us but I hope.
---
Classic is not hard, its very very easy. Its just a lot more time consuming.
---
What if the ques time is a consipiracy crafted to keep some people in BFA
---
Happy birthday mate, I hope you get to play asap
---
Try leveling when there are less than 20ppl withing a 10yd radius of you in an area with high mob density
---
This. Guessing OP didn't play Vanilla considering it's a major thing in the game?
---
weekly maintenance for an hour lol unlucky man :(
---
While waiting in queue i managed to do 4 hours of work, gym 1.5h, cook dinner 1h and i still had wait another hour before i got in.
---
Really not but ok
---
Did you try a different realm by chance?
---
Level 10 in 5 hours!
---
&gt; weekly maintenance for an hour lol unlucky man :(
---
Sheep. They're getting dumb rich from this. The least they can do is give a decent service.
---
Depends on the class. Casters using wands have the easiest time for the first 20-30 levels with how op those early wands are.

For some reason my launcher goes from my main account to some random wow-1 account.  Check if that's the case for yours.
---
In 18 levels I have gotten 1! Which I traded for a level 6 green bow haha
---
It matters if he can solo dungeons or pvp
---
Yeah dude, as a working adult this has been a pretty hefty kick in the nuts. I hope they do something to fix this, fast, because I just resubbed expecting that'd I'd be able to play this game with my friends.
---
Why would you need a free transfer if you have only played for less than one day? Just reroll?
---
The best part for me is that when I was a kid playing vanilla, I didn't really understand what was going on and just sort of did everything as it came, but as an adult I can appreciate the game and the attention that everything received. It really feels like the progression and character growth matters so much, every copper i get matters, every cloth or resource I get matters, and the best part is it's with all of my friends and other people, not like the action rpg the game has become.
---
Herod, I played for about 2-3 hours today but have been in line for 6 hours with probably another 3-4 to go. Pretty fucking sad honestly. At least when you're in it's pretty smooth and works.
---
Auto clicker
---
It says less than one minute
---
A few are lvl20+ already *and* every other realm has 4+ hour queues, too. The people that are 20+ are stock piling items for the people that haven't been able to play, also.
---
Thank you!
---
I like this meme
---
How so? Its a medium pop server that all my friends agreed on playing on plus my guild from retail.
---
Did they fix the zeppelins
---
Nice, keep grinding those levels
---
Or /console reloadui
---
It saves your current game state if you get d/c or logout wrong.
---
Better developed specs. That’s the only thing I am missing from Classic. TBC or even WotLK specs and we’d be good.
---
People see this though. Dude was standing at an innkeeper just jumping on the spot for 2hrs this morning, wasn't even a queue at the time. Probably wanted to get straight in after work. I reported and he's gone now, but another has taken his place. It's bullshit and unfair.
---
It would be unacceptable if this was a singleplayer RPG, but seeing as this is an MMORPG hosted on an actual server and not just your own computer means it's a little bit different.
---
This. It's not about getting to the end as fast as possible. It's nostalgia, the grind; working for that level, that sword, that skill... and appreciating the journey no matter how small the progress.  It's about all those unique interactions with others that are becoming more and more rare in gaming today, and teaming up to made the time less tedious and more memorable.  I'm at a point where I can truly appreciate a six-slot bag dropping, LFG in general chat, each new skill that makes the class feel more complete... 
---
I feel like this time around things will be different.
---
It's a bug, happened to me. Restart the launcher a few times.
---
&gt; Join Westfall because it is low pop
---
&gt; Full
---
One of the first servers, pvp, named after popular character.
---
If I 'log out' to switch characters will I have to wait through queue times again?
---
When you train cooking, you are given an ability that allows you to make your own fire. You do need the proper tools and reagents to make this fire though. Check the trade goods vendor for the required items.
---
Ask in trade if theres Dutch people?
---
It adds so much to the game, helping out. I gave the tailor a stack of linen in exchange for a  single linen bag, enabling him to make a free bag for the player in line behind me.
---
I skipped 90% of the starting area. I managed to get to level 2, then found a group that went out into Dun Morogh itself to grind mobs. Made the experience much better and I got 4 names on my friend list :D.
---
I mean to be fair no one was gonna be on Fairbanks until every screamed and had to bandwagon onto it so they could just play somewhere. I got on perfectly fine at 5:55pm. A friend tried to get on at 6:01pm and got slammed by a 5 hour que
---
ClassicCodex master race thoo
---
Holy shit, the kiddies are already falling off 1 day in.  GOOD LEAVE THE QUEUE SO I CAN PLAY!
---
This is the same as every fucking launch of a massive MMO.  Learn to deal with it.
---
This keeps happening to me and freaking me out.  Doesn't seem to actually affect anything but I'm nervous as hell I won't see it in time
---
You can use a program like rivatuner or nvidia profile inspector to cap fps.  Leave vsync off though
---
Where's the lie though
---
&gt;	Didn’t classic WoW have 3-4x the players BfA has now...?
---
*at least*
---
I thought it was more 10x. But it’s kind of hard to know being that they don’t release stats anymore.
---
But to the discussion, I think they’re using the queue times as free marketing. I’m sure they’re working on making it better, but it’s not exactly a bad problem to have (if it doesn’t last too long).
---
Fuck off with this bullshit about switch to a different server!
---
When you are already invested in your character and level 15-20+ and got a guild made you not gonna keep doing the fucking server dance you idjit's
---
I know it sucks but it's to be expected... It's why I'm not activating my sub until things die down.
---
But it was quality entertainment.
---
It’s taken me 30 minutes to go from 415 to 409
---
There was a female Tauren at one point I swear lol
---
Yeah but to not offer free server transfer will lead to loss of money because people will see it for what it is and unsubscribe.
---
Dudes an idiot.
---
I’m so tempted to buy a sub to play but all this bs about being in a queue has sacked it off
---
Your login is saved even if you get disconnected.  Makes it easy to get back into the game
---
Easy af compared to private servers in multipe ways
---
Fire/frost are fairly similar for levelling. Frost is slightly better single target but it has much better aoe, and it's better in pvp.
---
Same, but I'd see anything for those melons!
---
Don't forget the queue to get into queue that someone posted.
---
I've been in a "70 minute" queue for 2 hours lol.
---
Not sure there is a setting.  Its 1 extra mouse click
---
Thanks for the input. Also do Shamans have any chance to get spellpower trinkets and in general what's their loot priority compared to everyone else?
---
because of the grace period maybe? when i got dc earlier i had a few mins to get back into the game without having to wait for the queue
---
but i have no ideas how its work, just a guess
---
That makes sense
---
the problem is that his friends are way ahead and there's no way he can catch up unless he makes them stop playing for who knows how long, which is stupid. I'm in the same situation.
---
A few comments up posted a link to a very detailed EXP guide. 2 person party gets 100% exp, divided by 2. 3 person gets 116.6% divided by 3, 4 is 130% and 5 is 140%. If you can kill 5 mobs in a group of 5 in the same time it takes 3 to kill 3, or 1 to kill 1, then the Exp is surely best at 5 people. 
---
I have only played solo since re-release, but what I recall is an inefficient 4-5 person party isn't worth it. If you can kill fast and get mobs in reasonable time, 4-5 is probably your faster way to get EXP.
---
could just use teamviewer to remote in on your pc. thats what I did on Monday to jump the queue at 6pm.
---
RemindMe! 7 days "Hows that queue lookin"
---
There was several top streamers sitting in queues.
---
Literally just give it a few days
---
Yes dude.
---
Classic has a built in fps capper bruh
---
I haven’t been able to play at all unfortunately. I thought layering was supposed to address this?
---
what server is this
---
Calling other people Kiddies, but somehow you have 9 hours to wait in queue?
---
It was added back but not the same, it was reduced to the lowest settings possible.
---
Classic &gt; Retail
---
For those of you looking for a solution to queue times: Chrome remote desktop!
---
Tomorrow I'm going to log in from work and start my queue after lunch. That way when I'm done after 5 hours I'll finally be able to play!
---

---
OK, so at a technical level, how would you propose this launch should have been done differently? More servers at launch?
---
I’m not saying it won’t have a healthy core following long term (myself included) but I’ll be surprised if the big crowds and overpopulation last more than a week or two.
---
I agree with this, the thrill of the hunt is much more real without flying.
---
Then your whole fuckin' layer disconnects and half your group goes into a queue. 
---
The guilt as you continue on is heavy.
---
From people like you lmao
---
Yes it does. Thank you.
---
Bring a good attitude. Make sure you have enough free time to devote to the run.
---
Do zoomers not know how to press print screen or something?
---
Would be easy to get world first 60 with two people that know what they are doing who account share.
---
Yeah, thata my impression
---
I did this. I want more.
---
Ok, thx !
---
No worries, thanks for the response.
---
So wrong. There are vendors everywhere that sell them for SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. No one is buying your stabbing auctions
---
been at 40 for 45 mins
---
Nice.
---
:(
---
How does helping them kill the mob reduce the xp? If they tagged it first you dont get xp for it.
---
Fire is a bit more squishy, but more dps.  Still gets a decent amount of control.  The biggest problem is that when you get into the 50+(55+?) dungeons a ton of the mobs are fire mobs(the black rock dungeons/raid are in a volcano) so you are kind of forced to go frost for your late 50 and early 60 progression.
---
no
---
Do I sit here scared that it's just frozen? Or do I reboot client and try again
---
It's a game with magic. First quest is to find an enchanted torch that floats over your head. Problem solved.
---
Yeah my bad, I didn’t realize they were EU servers until after I commented.
---
It says “This guy has people that care about me.”
---
The 12,000 people in queues shows that it’s a success to me!
---
The queue wouldnt even be 12 hours if people would, you know, log off when they get off. Which frees up space. So other people can play.
---
Basically LOL  
---
Watching this again, I could have gotten away, but it would have been tight and I would have needed to potion and play it carefully and I still probably would have died. Figured this was more disrespect anyways\~
---
Literally pressing prt scr is an instant screen shot full rez, anything less is small brain.
---
Ahh, okay. I may not use it then. Thank you for the response.
---
You thought you did but you didn't.
---
Same, no idea what is going on, and I don't have the time to re-que and have the wait be 2hrs+ to see if that is the issue. So I'm just letting it sit there and see what happens. Either way it will be too late to play any if it doesn't pop in the next hour or so. Fucking going to be just as bad on the weekends too.
---
Wanted my good ole' Bilinear texture filtering but noooo, not tonight.
---
lol no
---
When I was in college playing wow (Vanilla), this would have been considered impossible...
---
Do you own a game company? Do you do this kinda stuff on the daily? Where you Manage sever stress and data? No? Didn’t think so. So get your head out of your ass, child.
---
$ATVI bois, trust me on this.  We already know next quarter's revenue gonna be big, get your sub money for the next year off these gains!
---
1. Blizzard worries that 75% of players will leave after the hype wears off in a few months, that they think they do
---
2. If they released too many servers there would be tons of low pop dead servers.
---
3. They use layering to pack as many people in one server as possible because they're planning for the people who thought they did to quit
---
Bump
---
The World Server crashes or the layer/shard you are in crashes and you get disconnected and end up back in the fucking queue.
---
My sibling still had it in their room at my parents house. Same one I used back then. It’s absolutely been the catalyst for most of my nostalgia moments past two days.
---
Thx a lot!
---
Hmm... I mean certainly such a small number of people have had to log off in the past 45 minutes right?
---
Are you serious I hit 5 minutes at the start of the weekly maintenance 😭
---
&gt;stop blaming Blizzard
---
&gt;just don't play it
---
&gt;make your own game
---
Ah, the cornerstones of a fanboy argument.
---
maybe we dont want our progress deleted across multiple shitty unstable private servers?
---
Literally all they need to do is offer free transfers to the lower pop realms and keep opening them until they find stability. But somehow this is a difficult decision for them.
---
Thanks, I’m mostly bummed because I was stoked to play with my cousin who’s never played wow, and he’s currently level 22 playing with our guildies, and I’m going to bed, still sitting at level 8
---
WRONG
---
lolno
---
It’s been out for one day give it some time you impatient fuck.
---
Better than me buddy. I've had one hour on Incendius over the past 2 days before getting DCed.
---
Love the thank macro for buffs.
---
Stfu and just be happy
---
Yeah please respond
---
Is there any point apart from an inherent sense of fairness about FIFO? We had people wanting to do that on my server but I don’t see the point since the boss dies instantly on respawn anyways. As long as there are full groups of 5.
---
oh ok, how does this look?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132133525101-20505133
---
Noted.
---
I will need some more time to test those macros. Also there seem to be a relating bug: “Macros that cast Pet abilities without specifying the rank do not update when the Pet learns a new rank of the ability” https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294717/wow-classic-list-of-known-issues-for-august-26th
---
Basically the +healing and +spell power from gear affects rank 1 spells just like rank 10 spells, so if you have a lot of bonus healing you get mana free heals from using low ranks essentially. Same reason why rank 1 frostbolt is op in duels as a mage.
---
LOL
---
We destroyed him a few times during city raids and the dude is legit the world's biggest crybaby when he loses. He desperately searches for excuses as to why he'd lose and then when we got bored and left he'd cheer as if he scared us off. Dude is a nut job
---
"good things come to those who wait"   
---
We're all paying a fee to play a game. They're getting rich from this and thousands of clients can't get what they paid for. People even subscribed early to get a name and now it's worthless cause they can't play and are told to reroll and therefore probably lose the name.   
---
Have some empathy and don't be sheep. You, me, op; we're all consumers. Not the multi million company.
---
I tried this as well as through their site and neither are working for me
---
Call it however you want, but today the queue time was even longer, peaking at 5 hours. Do you think that is allright? That is a nightmare for every dedicated player! Server and world firsts are nothing but luck now
---
Why the fuck would population not be measured against server capacity and/or design limit. But really explains our confusion from having queue timer on a medium populaiton server.
---
The clip is pretty hard evidence that he does. Y'know with him admitting and stuff. Why don't you try and be more open to topics.
---
Been at "less than 1 minute - 20th in queue" @ Mankrik for about 35 mins now....
---
 im afraid to touch the window again.
---
Shit I forgot about that lol
---
That is heart breaking.

---
Yeah we get it.
---
I am about to go to bed.... I will try the same thing with the queue... throw it up before I head to work and pray for an 8 hr queue. Otherwise I am 3daying it this weekend.... grinding as hard as I can to play catchup... the Black Qiraji mount is literally my only drive to play WoW Classic... I want that mount...
---
Each character/pet can only have one instance of the buff. It lasts 10 minutes
---
I have to leave for work now so I dont have time to set it up but will do that when I get home while waiting in queue. Hopefully I get it to work. I have never tried any remote control applications so I dont know if those are conplicated to use.
---
Thanks for the advice mate!
---
Thats what I was assuming thanks.
---
You literally can't buy the training. You must take that talent or you can't use the weapons.
---
Time for a random windows update!
---
Take a chill pill and relax. This is the Classic Experience. Just sit in Queue and play something else for an hour or 2
---
cry more baby
---
Get ready to DC while playing lol
---
It's funny because many people have posted the responses from Blizzard and this has been discussed for years at every launch. Just stop posting these stupid shitty complaints literally everyone is dealing with the same problem so fuck off.
---
Fire is more fun imo

Never. You are ignorant.

&gt;  I'm so happy classic is being released, so those old school fans can be happy. However, retail is fine where it is at.
---
Why are you in this subreddit lmao
---
I can see the body tho?? Tf do you mean. It's much less pleasing to look at compared to other races, in my opinion.
---
hey i played for 17 hours, i don't have any macros and i waited in 3 queues lol.  
---
but i agree, i've been in a (listed) 70 min queue for over 2 hours.  
---
it was originally 230 min and went down reasonable to that expectation but it's sat at 70 for a long time.  move 1-3 spots every 5 seconds or so.
---
Damn, glad I now know it won't work for me
---
They said the same about Old School Runescape, game has only grown and became it's own entity. I predict this "nochanges" will change and they'll in time release updates in fashion of Classic.
---
Just start the expansions over again. Alt-universe, slight differences or huge ones. Don't add in the anti-community focused features. Keep the forced codependence

---
I have sympathy but blizzards post indicated more than 2 or 3. The DC of course is an issue but it is an online game - not sure any company can promise zero wobbles on an long term connection. I would see how it is in a week and go from there I guess.
---
USB Wifi adapters are universally junk. You should be using a proper PCIe/M.2 wifi adapter.
---
As an avid OSRS player, the two ideas do clash very hard. Many times the polling system can be frustrating bec people sometimes suck, but at the end of the day, it has been what's best for the game. When things don't pass, the dev team goes back and makes changes based on feedback and tries to pass better content that matches what more of the community wants.
---
Yeah you could be me, and realize that the computer I have isn't capable of running the game at all. I've decided to wait a few months so that I can save up to build a new computer that can.
---
Came from work at 5pm to play, its 9pm and cant been able to play. Why do you release something ppl cant play?
---
So pissed!
---
Wasn't this on a pserver where there were highly increased respawn rates, and a more effective mage aoe? Not sure so thats why i ask the question :P
---
ha. virgins.
---
TeamViewer will turn your PC on?
---
Uh no. I logged on Fairbanks for lunch break at work around 10:45 PDT, got in queue, ate, went back to work for 40 min, then played for an hour. I then used TeamViewer to log in on my home PC when I left at 3:30 and I'll probably be in right after I get kids down at 8 PM or so.
---
I'm sure they will offer server transfers at some point just play on what ever realm and transfer later
---
It's just the initial launch.  I would be shocked if all these servers remained healthy in a month.  My guess is they are going to merge servers with free xfers by end of year.
---
Check back in four months when I'm unemployed and clad in dirty rags because salary and clothing prevents me from farming for weekly MC runs
---
Hop on a pvp server itll fill up
---
How can you say no to that?
---
I'm sad it was the PST one called Thunderfury. I wanted it to be EST.
---
At least you got to play. Some of us haven’t played at all yet...
---
Is this momento?
---
Why do we assume this?
---
Should have called it serpico
---
Please tell me when I acted like a bitch? I'm just chilling I queue laughing at everyone who wants a refund because a game was popular and they have to wait.  I give it a week and the queue times will be back to normal.
---
I mean I guess it's too much to ask for people to ha e realistic expectations. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
I'll tell you what will kill the longevity of the servers: Creating a ton of servers to accommodate the launch numbers. 
---
The game will NEVER see as many concurrent players as it's seeing right now, ever again. If they make enough servers to where there are 0 queue times during launch, all they did was spread us so thin that in a couple of months those servers will be dead. (This is also the reason that they will be getting rid of layering before phase 2, as it will no longer be needed as launch numbers decrease).
---
This is frustrating, but also an amazing sign for the longetivity of the game. Most of these servers will have large, healthy communities. It would be an awful sign to see no queues at all. Big picture.
---
I saw a photo recently on oceanic servers that they weren’t full, I’m not sure if that’s the case right now though
---
Ultimately people need to stop the whole, “The game begins at 60” mantra and realize that the journey IS the game. You’ll find a hell of a lot more enjoyment in it.   Take time to explore and have fun. Be stoked with gaining only a half level in a play sesh. Life would be a lot less stressed for a lot of folks.
---
I can see how a lot more people would have stayed without all this queue nonsense.  
---
So what if servers become ghost towns?  They can't just combine them like they did for retail?  
---
Player retention seems more likely when they don't have to wait hours to play your game.
---
Sharding probably keeps the populations looking fine no matter what.
---
No idea. I know all about dipping though.
---
Dipping chicken nugs into ranch
---
Dipping chicken nugs into BBQ sauce
---
Dipping fries into ketchup
---
Dipping my hand into a bag of chips
---
Your point 2 is why I am torn on what to do.  I can give up 4 hours played yesterday and make a new dude, but I may just sit down tomorrow and both realms are full and I have to jump to another new server.
---
Its day 2. Let's talk on day 30
---
You sound stable.

Dude why are you bitching over something that will fix itself in like 3 more days.  Why does nobody have any patience anymore??
---
4 hours to get here, too
---
&gt; Flying demolished the size of scale the world 
---
a) Flight paths have always existed
---
b) Flying is a max-level reward. You've already experienced the scale of the world by the time you get flying
---
&gt; all but completely removed world pvp
---
There's plenty of world PvP right now on BFA even with flying. The real problem was the lack of incentive for world PvP. Battlegrounds and dishonorable kills are what "all but completely removed world pvp".
---
I started playing in BC and by the time LK was being announced I was constantly talking about how I would love a Classic only server.
---
They changed the population tags now, if theres a queue it's considered full. As of 6pm pdt I started at 12500 queue on Fairbanks, 8500 as of 7:15
---
Dont worry I started que, went to work, came back and I'm still waiting.....

It's like if I tell my drunk buddy he'll regret going hope with that girl in the morning and he texts me mid pump to tell me I was wrong and he's having a great time.  Yeah it's not morning yet
---
I've been on Estimated Time 4 minutes for the past 25 minutes.

---
This legit made me LoL
---
Hahahahaha so hype! Wooooo
---
You are in college and can't spell queue?  Good luck!
---
Okay but what happens when layering is turned off?
---
I bet only a handful of people are doing this. By far not the main contributors of the queue.
---
Not gonna install to find out.
---
take a screenshot use paint while you wait.
---
no they dont
---
To be fair, that is a fairly basic concept when it comes to designing things. You often don't want to give the customer what they ask for, but instead something that better solves their problems. But also, think of all the people who asked for the changes many Classic players dislike. Wouldn't "you think you do, but you don't" be a reasonable thing for someone who thinks LFD ruined WoW to say about the feature?
---
Well if I don't then it's not everyone, now is it
---
Wow such a hot take.
---
&gt; We have expectations with Blizzard
---
You aren't very bright bud. Stop projecting your game management inadequacies on me.
---
Doesnt matter. The reason layers are bad is because it can limit the amount of people in each. As player count dwindles they remove layers. Then its literally not an issue
---
Thats the only solution i see
---
Brings a whole new meaning to the term “themepark mmo”
---
I did say I am a league of legends player, I suffer from minor autism
---
Are you referring to end game raiding or solo leveling?  Because leveling in retail is baby mode easy.
---
This sucks man, i hope it gets better for the weekend
---
Vanilla servers were tiny.  Blizzard said today that a full realm back then is only a medium server today.  Even if a realm is low pop, they can merge the layers and it'll still probably be a high pop server in 2003 terms.
---
They don't even learn from the mistakes from the last day. Today it peaked at 5 hours of waiting time. Dedicated world first groups had to replace people because they had one disconnect, which destroyed that player chances of a world/realm first
---
Funny story..... your friends will have the same trouble getting on as you.
---
&gt;Same I'm honestly getting tired of these dumb ass tribal posts. It makes the classic community look elitist and toxic. I like amy schumer. I like dan carlyn. There are pros and cons to both. They both can be fun and I'm glad we now have the option to play both.
---
Why? Because I dont want to sit in queues for 3 hours a day. Thats 3 more hours of playing.
---
Just be happy I only have 5 accounts. There are dozens of people doing 40
---
I can’t get over 15 now on my pc it’s dogshit
---
I can’t predict if they will or not of course, but that’s a worry in the back of people’s minds. No one wants to put a lot of work into a character into for their home to be dead months down the road. Inevitably some of these realms will die off, I just hope Blizz considers an option for them down the road. It be nice to hear them put out a statement on it as well.
---
Im one of those people who rolled on a pve server with small queues. But I still think the game being literally unplayable for hours after the official start of your gaming session is a perfectly valid reason to quit.
---
Would you accept it if it was any other game?
---
Most gathering mats on AH are barely over vendor price lol
---
Anyone dumb enough to fall for that won't have the gold for it anyway.
---
It'll simmer down in a few days but yes blizzard way underestimated the number of players. 
---
What do you expect the wildly incompetent J.A. Brack told us we didn’t even want classic.
---
3 hours isn't the worst honestly. Suffer now and then actually be a server that isn't dead in 3 weeks
---
its totally not that though. They knew what numbers to expect. They have scalable architecture designed for this purpose. All I can say are they are either being throttled by their ISPs or they themselves refuse to hire the extra bandwidth because its a monthly type deal - and the initial surge is only expected to last 1-3 weeks. In short, with all of the money they are making with resubs they still won't fork out the cash for more bandwidth because activision wants more money.
---
It's all about money money money. It's funny because it's usually this type of mindset that a multinational will bring to a new acquisition - which will then turn the success of the company into a cash cow. It's what happens when you replace a gamer CEO with a MBA economics major who is surrounded by spineless yes-men.
---
He's already dead.  The thirst has him now.  My condolences.
---
Layering won't be turned off for months.  A ton of players will have quit by then.
---
no one really knows
---
that said, I don't know how they keep so many retail servers "full"
---
Just pick another name or wait. No one cares what your name is.
---
Same here. I gave up all my names om Pagle and it's still jam packed. It's not fun standing in a mob of people trying to tag quests creatures. Never mind the crashes and queues.
---
it’s launch week...
---
Kite it boss
---
You can also cast it on Warlock demon minions.
---
The hype will die and tourists will leave, it won't be this crazy for long.
---
I can't wait until he's old enough to start questing with me!
---
How about swap to a new server? 
---
Hows this for a hot take: Blizzard isn’t failing you. You are failing yourself.
---
Wish there was a screenshot of that

---
There’s no sense designing servers for the first couple weeks / months of the game when the servers are going to be around for at least 2 years.
---
Read it backwards then if that comforts you more.
---
You will be okay
---
The queues will die down 
---
You will get in game
---
So much easier for me &amp; him haha although after some time my legs do go completely numb. Depends on how fast he finishes his bottle lol
---
Yo, that’s a whole battalion of dudes.
---
Exactly! :D
---
Heh, their filters are kinda funky. I've got Kink and Kinkshame, but Kinky contains mature language haha
---
Are you autistic, new servers are filling up faster than blizzard can roll them out. How is that a failure?
---
he straight up lied to you
---
Well yeah they’ll probably be physically dead from the load
---
6-10* FTFY
---
&gt; Idk why you guys want to stay on the most over populated server.  
---
Easier said when you're playing solo, mate.
---
Well, hardware resources are of course finite but there are many tricky problems that companies have solved. Twitch for example can handle 200k+ viwers on a single channel.
---
From where I can see, there are no "less populated servers". They are all listed as full
---
I'm on Incendius and I've been stuck on Queue: 338 / Estimated Time: 4 minutes for the past 1 hour.

---
Hey, Noggenfogger made me swap.
---
lol you can go afk in the queue it wont boot you
---
They've already boosted server capacity. They should open more servers to mitigate player traffic. But its early on, I wouldn't be surprised if in a mo month or so we saw different player numbers.
---
And also how basic/simple it is. Dps rotations are very very simple
---
Yea I dont understand the technology but is adding layers more costly or difficult so they keep plugging in servers?
---
Serious I dunno
---
Lolusux
---
You do realise that, if it will happen like that, people will leave for the wrong reasons. Only adding to the failure.
---
And you also do realise that if this were the case, blizzard will say "ha! We told you so!" based on a very false and delusional premise, further contributing to the "hindsight" of blizzard. 
---
Classic is immensely popular, and I don't see why Blizzard is refusing to admit this. They should give up their non-existent pride for once.
---
Then again, this is an extreme example. But you yet the point.
---
None of the crafting profs are particularly "profitable" outside of niche/extreme cases like being one of the only people with a high value recipe that comes from a raid or something.
---
He IS triggered.  What kind of *RETARD* goes into a CLASSIC WOW subreddit just to whine about it? 
---
*A triggered retard who can't accept their BFAbaby status in a game that would make them rage quit irl. 
---
r/battleforazeroth.  There you go, idiot.  Make brainlet posts about classic all day hahahahahaha no one here cares
---
You got Bigglesworth though.
---
Yes. Play the game vs waiting to play the game. You will thank me later.
---
It's the blizzard launcher, not the WoW launcher... They have control of blizzard, but doesn't mean they make decisions for WoW
---
Its basically impossible for anyone working a normal day shift to  to play during the week for the first few weeks. Pretty bad
---
10+ hour queue right there. I started my queue at 13k at 1pm. It's been over 7 hours and I'm at 3.8k...
---
not sure how my position in the queue keeps being downgraded. are certain people being slipped in ahead of me or what?
---
For sure! He's only a month old now. Hard to imagine him being any bigger honestly. Time feels very slow right now. &amp; you're right he's only up for about an hour for feeding/changing then its lights out for about 3 hours. Not sure what the hell we're going to do when he's up all day CRAWLING.
---
Because Classic is an immensely superior game, the ones who never played it didn't believe it, and now retail has quickly become an afterthought.
---
Because being 2 steps behind the no lifers in one thing most of us can’t keep up, but being 20 steps behind is a lot to ask for
---
Pfff gotta add a Shift and Ctrl modifier so you can also cast a level 1 fireball on your focus.
---
Non-mana using classes don't have to worry about spell ranks. It's just mana-users. And yes, my weapon was bad at the time.
---
Bro thank you so much!  Was considering subbing to LogMeIn so I can remote into my home PC and avoid the queue
---
Hahahah were you that guy on gehennas? I literally loled when I read someone write this in durotaes general

He's very angry that people dont like his shitty WoW clone. 😂 😂
---
Why?  Does a mage tank mobs and say they should have to kite?  You have the tools to do it if you don't want to that's your problem.
---
Shhh wtf
---
But could I potentially craft some gear for people leveling up that could still turn on a profit on the Auction House?
---
They just added more servers like an hour ago
---
There is an NPC that will let you learn pet talents that you can teach to your pet as it gains training points, or whatever they're called.
---
Also, make sure you use the train ability to teach it growl to help hold aggro, if you have not already. If you don't have the train skill, you need to do the other pet quests.
---
Get home at 6:30 and I immediately queue. It's 9:23 and I'm still waiting and probably have at least another hour which basically means I'm not playing tonight. That's ridiculous.
---
So a game released worldwide has players of different cultures and you’re surprised or upset by this?
---
:D that's the plan! Hoping other dads get their kids into pc gaming. Nothing wrong with console, I've had my fair share but PC master race amirite?
---
log in during the morning and set up a simple auto clicker. They wont ban you be like the rest of us and never wait in line!
---
Man I haven’t had this feeling in 15 years. It’s insane.
---
In 2004 they capped servers at 2500 players.
---
There are plenty of other servers. I feel like y'all are really punishing yourselves by insisting to play on a specific server even if it means queing. 
---
I got on with literally no problem.
---
Noice.
---
4K queue means 3 hours on Aragul
---
What?
---
&gt;Why are you upset that this game is having a FAR more successful launch than you ever could have expected? 
---
Just wanna clarify that I'm not upset or anything.  Had a blast playing Classic so far but I can understand why some people would be.  Also, it isn't far more successful than I could have ever expected it's only far more successful than blizzard expected.  Every single PVP server being full right now is unacceptable.
---
&gt; People can expect whatever they want.
---
Now you're getting it, now stop projecting your inadequacies on others. If you think this is the "only way", you aren't very bright.
---
People who are leveling are as broke as you are.
---
Can you run a retail and classic at the same time?
---
I mean it depends how many people are speaking Spanish. If its like 5 percent of the server who cares. If its like 95 percent then that sucks if you don't speak Spanish.
---
I understand that. It just seems fishy. Him also openly admitting to it in this clip is kinda suspicious as well.
---
They have enough data and experience to know the ideal number of realms for a given population. They also  know how long will take to some people quit the game. So a temporary solution for higher cap realms seems better for me than creating realms that will die or let 100k + people in queues.
---
\&gt; People just want to have every class at lvl cap with no effort. 
---
People want to actually experience new content with their friends/guild. After you've leveled once the replayability goes way down, especially if most other people are max level.
---
Leveling is actually hella fun when the zones are crowded, but it quickly becomes a chore if the rest of the server is raiding/doing bgs/etc.
---
You can craft gear for guild mates. I did that today for the guild leader.
---
Its all part of the experience, but it really wasn't all that bad after all. I was expecting and got the madhouse that is was, and today wasn't nearly as bad.
---
The fact that when you party up with people for quests, everyone actually talks with one another and everyone stays until each party member completes the quest then actually thanks everyone in the group for helping. Man I missed these times
---
Oh now this is META.
---
Google nostalrius man.
---
Pre establishing a guild is great and all but now you stuck  waiting rather than playing. I'm just waiting till things calm down to commit to a guild.
---
Just happened again.. except this time I'm at the back of the line. 6 hours of queue time wasted
---
Credit to the other parent who had this absolutely genius idea to use their baby monitor for keeping an eye on their queue. Now I don’t have to sit in my third world country 90 degree room.
---
I've been in a queue that has read 30-60 minutes for hours.
---
&gt;yes BFAbabies whine about Classic nonstop including for 2 years since petition
---
&gt;stop talking about BFA 
---
You have the freedom to not post if you dont like BFA criticism.  r/Battleforazeroth. 
---
Go to your safe space.
---
Enabling/normalizing asshole behavior, also makes you an asshole.
---
Oh the photo of the gnome walking around would have helped.
---
Grab a wand my dude. It is really a day and night difference once you hit more with your wand than with sbolt.
---
Best I can suggest is to Remote Desktop to your pc at home and fire up the game and get in queue around lunch or last break.
---
You likely had Cartographer 
---
Try SimpleMap
---
 though it's not moveable afaik and it's not quite as small.
---
It's been one day, get on the same server, and move on. 
---
People are so gogogogo =/
---
You are an idiot.
---
Having a large part of the player base unplayable to play is a huge problem.
---
No one cares. Fuck off with these posts.
---
I didn't even think it was possible to have a 27k queue until yesterday.
---
Awesome, I had some good moments of helping people out too.
---
I logged in at 3pm CST (14.7K queue) - 930pm CST at 1.8k. 
---
Kind of nuts considering I would've had to log on around 1-2pm I could've had some good playing time.
---
&gt; over at r/wow people are just happy 
---
LOL! You must not use wow at all kid.
---
Makes sense, i guess. Thanks for info, bra
---
The multiboxer likely has 120s on all those accounts and farms gold in retail to pay for the sub.
---
You fucking moron.
---
Yup. Twice now. Waiting in the queue for the third time now and still haven't been able to get on once.
---
Why is Asmon even listed here? He barely qualifies. I'm lvl 17 throw me up there.
---
There were multiples polls taken, all of which you can find here on Reddit.
---
Now, let's see if what you're fixing to say is what I think you'll say.. =D
---
People will definitely drop out. Whether its because they don't have the time commitment to leveling, they feel stuck because they completed all of westfall and they're still only level 13 and don't know what to do, they spend 2 hours doing nothing but being a ghost followed by 30 seconds of non greyscale in stv, or they actually hit endgame and get kitted out. 
---
That and I feel people nowadays are much more unforgiving of game imbalance. The game will be theorycrafted to death and you're just going to get dunked on by rogues 1v1 every time or 2 shot by a warrior in t3.
---
You are better than everyone in this sub! I agree, everyone in here should be ashamed to exist. They should be embarrassed of how they engage with others. They are all greedy, selfish, and self-centered.
---
Everyone in here is the type of person that would create a thread putting down everyone else in this sub, fuck them!
---
Those beast pets getting pats. Too cute!
---
I’m spending so much time skinning, the buff expires before I can get a good run of combat with the buff.
---
Unfortunately alot of people will get frustrated and quit due to the queues.
---
This is amazing. I'm assuming warrior is supposed to be "good at 60" not 16?
---
They said they worried that if they made too many servers they might end up being ghost towns by phase two which I completely understand. I would rather have initially crowded servers than a bunch of them at launch that dwindle down to nothing and end up having to get merged.
---
What is censored down there?
---
I was gonna contact for support but the Live chat option was disabled
---
You got exactly what you paid for? People wanted the wow classic experience, this is it....
---
Then. How. The. Fuck. Have. I. Yet. To. See. A. Queue.
---
&gt; some of us prefer more modern WoW.
---
Then *dont go to Classic to stir shit* roflmao
---
This looks so epic at the end
---
So far so good.
---
Having trouble getting my boar to hold aggro.
---
It’s a feature.     /s
---
Make sure you bought it on the right battle.net account
---
Thank god it's not that way on classic.
---
Lmaoooooo 😂😂😂
---
100% agree, and I did know that, but had some misguided idea that eating junk and drinking energy drinks would be fun and somehow add to the experience when it did pretty much the opposite. Really screwed up my sleep too. Oh well, now I've done it once I won't be doing it again.
---
Higher pop servers can withstand a good amount of people dropping off and still have a pretty healthy player base. Lower pop ones it’s up in the air.
---
Alliance trash.
---
Yep, everyone wants to be a warrior untill they gotta do warrior stuff
---
Yeah ghost servers are a bigger problem imo.
---
&gt; Does quitting the game mean you have to spend time and energy shitting on a game you no longer play
---
Post proof that youre playing classic, nub.
---
To think. Ive been awake longer than you, AND been in a queue the entire time.  /s ….I think...
---
You got that reversed buddy. Retail is all about simply being online for long amounts of time, artificial time gates and grinds that aren't hard, just tedious. Classic requires effort. Both take time, but one takes time for the sake of it.
---
People are literally following blizzards advice to change servers and STILL waiting in queues and idiots still have the gall to say it’s not blizzards fault. Holy shit the sheer stupidity.
---
Cancel form macro on all your spells.
---
&gt; Basically ignore the estimated time, it is all over the place.
---
Additionally, position in queue seems to spike forward on 30 minute intervals.  I suspect it's people making plans like *"I will play until 10pm tonight, then I have to get ready for bed"* and logging off around those benchmarks.
---
You can farm things significantly faster with 21 accounts.
---
Like one shotting mobs versus 20 shotting them...
---
It's far faster farming for plenty of shit.
---
&gt;A ton of players will have quit by then.
---
Source?
---
That's where my guild went.
---
But does Blizzard get it? Cause they promoted to the guy to CEO despite him clearly not being qualified.

I think it is set to max by default? Which I'm guessing max is 1, lowest is 0, and 0.x would be somewhere between?

I've been at &lt; 1 minute going up and down in position for over an hour now. Seems legit.

#nochanges
---
It's still the first day. I know you don't want to hear this, but it will get better in the coming days. I don't see much Bliz can do, if they're really trying to avoid creating too many servers.
---
I think there are limitations as to how many layers a server can handle. So, once the server is at layer capacity (&amp;pop), it's full and the line starts out the door, around the corner and a few miles down the FM road to the next town.
---
World of Warcraft 2
---
No one fucking cares
---
Almost as many Druids as rogues?
---
Yet how long have private servers been up for?
---
Yup. About to restart the game and I'll post results
---
That is what I've been doing, it is the new meta
---
Everyone knew (or should've known) this was coming.. wait to subscribe or play on a small server
---
lolwarsux
---
That sounds like a perfectly reasonable solution to me.
---
Am I reading this right, less than 10 minutes per level up to level 20?
---
Some people just can't be pleased
---
why so hostile
---
Have enough servers so people can play the game?
---
Except they have the technology to balloon and shrink servers thanks to layering. This is primarily a bandwidth issue. Dead realms only remain dead because they don't want to offer 'free' realm transfers because once again - they will lose out on people paying for those transfers.
---
I wouldn't trust their AMA, they let a large majority of their employees go just at the end of last year. The culture in that workplace is one of fear and unrealistic expectations. Make no mistakes, these are the hallmarks of a multinational takeover.
---
It's...a partnership, bro.
---
Not really. If server transfers aren't free people will probably unsub until they can play on their server.
---
Yeah no worries on that part because I bought it straight from Battle.net shop. Wait do I have to download normal wow as well to be able to play classic?
---
No, the only way you can fight people of the same faction is if two people decide to duel each other. Both players have to agree to it for the duel to start, so people on your faction can't randomly attack you.

Why is there so little rogues? I thought that was one of the most popular classes.
---
This sub last month: "Yo this is gonna be so big!"
---
This sub now: "Wtf this is too big, blizzard hello!?"
---
Could there be any fewer pixels in the top pic?
---
What’re they called?
---
What?  I think you may have misunderstood someone who talked about Skill ranks in regards to melee and casters..   
---
Mana Users would use lower rank spells for mana efficiency.  There is no real need for a warrior to down-rank skills.   So in that regard, non-mana using classes don't have to worry about spell ranks.  
---
But you absolutely need to rank up your skills as a melee character since higher ranked skills do more damage.
---
Okay well the streamer server scenario is unlikely. To your second point, you don’t choose who you play with anyway. Literally any community can migrate to any server they want.
---
?
---
Mine have been automatically going onto my bars. Is it just a Rogue thing? :S
---
I'd be so annoyed without questie and my online guide im following. Just how it is. I'm enjoying it my way, and that is fine.
---
You better not be neglecting a child to watch wow on their monitor
---
Because someone posts this same thing every 30 seconds
---
U okay?
---
Don't. People doing this is half the reason the queues are so retarded
---
That and actually fighting for gear.
---
No port for this poor souls cr?
---
Yeah I ended up getting in right before launch but still had to move to one of the realms they opened after launch so my friends could play
---
Same with Sulfras. Saw it was low pop this morning and now it's an hour and a half wait
---
I absolutely hate mechanical keyboards. I have the same one and love it because it is so flat. But I am a software dev. Coding on a mechanical key bored would drive me insane.
---
&gt; **downvote shill brigade** 
---
Ahh, the classic "there's no way anyone could downvote me without being a shill" defense. They could just be taking offense on the fact that you're stating claims about the inner workings of Blizzard's hardware and infrastructure, as well as the workplace conditions as if they are 100% true without actually posting any sort of source or evidence. Doesn't seem really hard to figure out why you got downvoted
---
BFA GUD CLASSIC BAD 
---
shit posts incoming.
---
I see streamers that are miles ahead of me with realtively the same time, i'm obviously doing something wrong here
---
Dude, my power went out 2 hours before launch, came back and then my internet went out for 36 hours. I tried connecting via my phone but it was to late, I was 21k in the queue.... Classic
---
Agree 100%.
---
F.
---
How entitled are you dude. It's a video game. Blizzard doesn't owe you anything.
---
This was vanilla...
---
BUT I DONT HAVE A PHONE...
---
Yeah. And I get it lots of these people have prob never experienced a big mmo launch before, but thats how they go. You’re either dedicated enough to fight it or just wait a week and play all you want lol
---
I did.  I don't regret it all.  Gave me an opportunity to coordinate what server I would play on with IRL friends.  I figured it would be a shit show, so it works for me.  Plus, a spend more money than that on food every day, so meh.
---
Word! Glad to have some insight on how that’s all working, and good luck and godspeed on fixing it. I’m sorry I don’t have anything helpful to add. 😎
---
Half these players won't even be playing wow for this long. 
---
What is happening is ridiculous.
---
Say 500k people bought the game. Only 200k can play. 300k people still bought the game and didn't play
---
They need to make temporary servers so the people that will quit anyways can play, and the people that will stick to the game can wait in queue
---
Can you post a map with a red circle on the path?
---
Me and my friends did this on Kromcrush and now I've been in queue since getting disconnected at 2030. Just keep pumping out those damn servers Blizzard. You're not even close to full yet.
---
On the contrary, I think \`Classic\` TBC would have way more draw than Classic Vanilla. It was a flat out more popular, more polished game.
---
Attunements, reps, and other forms of progression still exist but the game became way more accessible with things like Kara, Heroics and most specs evolving from meme tier into actual viability.
---
11k queue to get into Bigglesworth atm.
---
You had all the time in the world to switch servers after the multiple warnings Blizz gave of hour long queues. If you're gonna be stubborn with your server choice, you have to accept queue times.
---
I queued for over 7 hours last night, I can currently instantly get into the highest pop servers, this is something Blizzard have done
---
Bro I chose this place because it was supposed to me medium. Now everything is full!!!!
---
They have guides, friends, subs giving them shit, and a planned out route.
---
I don't think there is but the exact same thing happened last in my friends group. 2 were in playing, I was stuck in a queue for 2.5 hours, and halfway through the wait a 4th friend logged on and instantly bypassed the queues and got in. Some sort of queue bug?
---
Dude come on, you're just upset. You know you'll get in tomorrow.
---
Seriously? Why the fuck would he need to publicly apologize to you?
---
level 16 and level 6 no bags lol, I just made them myself.
---
Can we get a ban for the 12% of players the down voted? They are using auto clickers.
---
I used it to que from work while on my shift and when I got home, I was ready to go!
---
Literally in the same boat waiting for incendius. I had my fiance queue me up at 6pm while I was still at work. Mine has been telling me 23 minutes for the last hour. all my buddies are in :(
---
Leather doesn't really sell. Leatherworkers are going to take skinning and get all their own stuff. Tailors will need a single piece of leather to make a certain bag. I think blacksmiths need one or two pieces to make some weapons. Leather can be found often enough for those professions in random chests.
---
The only skinning products that sell decently to other players would be hides, deviate scales (maybe),dragon scales (maybe), and the very rare Pristine Hide of the Beast (drops from The Beast boss in UBRS)
---
id worry about the top 3 most popular full realms more honestly. "tourists" are the ones not really invested in the long haul. the ones that like to meme about the queue times rather than playing WoW are the type of mindset that are gonna just gonna quit when everyone else does because they don't actually care much about playing WoW.
---
They think we don't, but we really fuckin do
---
quit work for wow.  fuckin casual
---
Got in queue at 3 pm been at 250 for an hour and a half.
---
If you get DC'd, dont exit the game. Click "okay" and get put on the login screen and manually type your info in again, you will go straight to char select after a server DC.
---
Well you did link a 10 year-old article on politically bias news site.
---
Has Russia Today called yet? They may need another talking head.
---
Going on 5 hours here waiting in queue... 
---
This is such bullshit from Blizzard on how unprepared they were for Classic's launch.
---
I multibox and I mostly do it so I can be self sufficient profession wise and help the guild with consumables and food
---
That was before the rework of the label system. It happened at about 7:30 EST so like three hours ago and about three hours after you created your character. Sorry!
---
I mean, pretty much all eastern PVP servers have queue times.  Even Kromcrush which was released after launch has about 1h30 of queue.
---
Sounds like a solid plan. They said they can increase server capacity, the current limit is not a technical limit. If they are correct about an exodus in a few weeks then increased capacity during that period is the best solution.
---
You can say peak, or you can say stopped growing. Woglk was the first time people quit as often as New people joined.
---
Queues were never that bad for me back in the day, it was the 1) Spending hours to find a dungeon group, 2) Spending hours IN SAID dungeon group getting lost/dying or, 3) Standing around in an open field for hours lagging so hard you couldn't do anything
---
I’m so jealous
---
Omg look at that dip in Fortnite, that's Epic shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Pretty much all the servers have long queue times now. Not sure what the two new ones are like but will likely be jammed by tomorrow like the rest
---
I think the idea is to increase the cap on the server and add more.layersm layers will be around for a while and by the time they drop them some people will stop playing so it won't be an issue.

---
B Allen Sack
---
This is where I realized this too lol
---
Servers have a capacity, layers just divide that up
---
&gt;Should I level ele or enh?
---
Enhance is fine with an int set in the bank. Ele has horrible downtime with there mana costs. Luckily for horde most instances arent too far off a capital city. Otherwise keep it in your bag while out in the world. Full Agi/Str gear will be unsustainable for your group by Scarlet Monastery in the low 30s
---
&gt;From what level is resto required to heal dungeons? 
---
52+, maybe for sunken temple but definitely for BRD and above. 
---
&gt;Do you have any reference to a shaman leveling guide?
---
No, just experience. I rolled dwarf priest this time around.
---
Took me 6 hours earlier
---
Because hes a very special snowflake
---
where is your argument though. this fixes nothing but delaying the inevitable ( in my opinion for a short time). at the expense of creating a avoidable problem. people not quiting after a year because they suffert through queues for the first months is a weird argument.
---
Logged in at 3pm CST Herod - 14.7k in queue. Now it's almost 10pm - 1.7k in queue. 
---
Guess it's another late nighter.
---
The way to level is to tell as many Chuck Norris jokes as possible in general chat...and make sure to ask where Mankrik’s wife is too
---
I’m suddenly brought back to Sophomore year of high school, YTMND  and arguing with people in general chat
---
Nice I’m 15 with 0 drops
---
I'm also Incendius. This can't just be a coincidence. Is there some sort of mass trolling going on right now?
---
No idea my dude. It's not my job to know these things. There's a whole bunch of people who work at Blizzard who are literally paid to figure this stuff out. 
---
All I'm saying is those people dropped the ball, or were perhaps cut off at the knees by management. Either way, the user experience has been way below sub-par this time around.
---
Sure, you play on a low or medium server tonight and tomorrow you have a queue.  So tomorrow you start over on a new low or medium server and play for a night.  The next day you have a queue on that server. 
---
People are sitting in queue because they don't want to keep starting over.
---
Tonight I've been in queue 2 hours for the Kromcrush server which was created yesterday from what I understand.
---
If you are US come to Bigglesworth, we are playing with some friends horde in here, i can invite u to guild. msg me ingame: drunkmers
---
Used a ranged attack to pull out one mob at a time, older mmos are even harder than vanilla
---
Haha, you are fine man. Enjoy yourself for both of us. I’m fine watching the streams, trust me. I appreciate it though and means a lot.
---
The worst are people acting like this is okay - "iTs tHe cLasSiC WoW ExPeRienCe!"
---
Like fuck off I basically gave $18 to Blizzard so that I can stare at a que?
---
Casual players are not remotely on the same plane as no lifers.
---
It'll be like quitting a sport because you're too far behind Roger Federer, like what?
---
So some people should have their character gimped so others can have a more immersive experience? Go tell that to the people who just bought their Arcanite Reaper.
---
Ok that's what I thought. Seems a lot of people are misunderstanding the system.
---
Use team viewer. Great mobile Remote Desktop
---
It's only been 35 hours though? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely not hopeful, but still.
---
What server is this on?
---
And it is again!  Thank you!

Pussy
---
How about getting yourself some friends op?
---
Well remember that really annoying bug that really annoyed you? Its still there in the past.
---
Nah man, Popeyes has knocked out Chik Fil A for me with their chicken sandwich.
---
Most ToS wont hold up in court.
---
Waited in a queue for Stalagg for 6 hours last night and quit before even getting 75% of the way through lmao
---
If they do that - what's the plan for later phases, when layers are removed?
---
Everyone is going to want to come back for later phases. Even the retail folks that never hit 60. If you just open more layers now, you're just pushing even bigger queues off until later phases because the server will have more 'mains'.
---
I don't think there is a good solution here, unfortunately. The community needs to spread out more to prevent queues, but the social dynamics of WoW make people want to converge on a small set of mega-servers. It's a shitty situation. That's for sure.
---
I would be right there with you but I decided to roll a warrior for the first time to really get the gritty experience. So far I'm loving it though!
---
I'm seeing the same thing happen as i type this on Pagel
---
True, but then again the world bosses targeted anything within x amount of yards, while normal mobs don't
---
Nah I played overwatch while I waited yesterday!
---
Joined queue on Herod today at 4:30pm.
---
It is now 10:53 pm. 
---
There are still 1600 people ahead of me.
---
I'd have ripped all my hair out by now if I didnt work from home permanently...
---
It's amazing to me that digital lines for purchases can even exist. I can understand it but at the same time it's so rare that it just reminds me that nothing can really stop something this massively popular from being overwhelming for the developers.
---
Yup. It's good to see them taking this approach. The hype is too real but in 3 months we'll have a fraction of the players we have now. So they are right that eventually they'll have to shut a lot of these servers down, and having to merge them is such a pain in the ass. People might be upset now but it'll make a better experience for the rest of its lifespan.
---
But will the transfers be free though. No one wants to pay $25
---
Population is based on current players.  Even Arugal was rated as “low” this morning.  They’ll all be high once the strayans get off work.
---
Yes I was removed from the queue twice. I logged back in immediately and it saved my place. This just means I've had to watch the queue all day. Been in the queue for 8 hours now.
---
because no one needs to know how many people are connected to the server when no one can connect.
---
Maybe they are sorting out ui?  Show me people doing anti afk macros
---
It sucks how 10 years ago Blizzard name was sterling.  And now weve had 3 shitty starcraft games, D3, and now BFA.
---
Record on private servers is 3d 6hr i believe, will be interesting what people will get here
---
This is some serious business...
---
Theres a set capacity one servers, layering just breaks them apart.
---
Also, have you noticed since the game got released there has been no posts on why layering is bad for launch and how it's going to ruin everything?
---
I wonder what happened
---
Same thing on Kromcrush. 4.3k queue when I got d/ced around 2030. Sitting at 700 now at 2300.
---
Layers can be on different servers.  Hence the horizontal scaling aspect.  Layers are just separate "realms" all under one realm name.  They share channels, AH, and players get instanced between them when grouping.
---
They fixed this BTW.  If a server had a queue it now says full.
---
I’m up to level 12 so I’m not moving. I get home at 3 pst from work and login no issue. Sucks trying to relog later that evening though.
---
Yeah if you really want to play with your friends you should bite the bullet and re-roll with them on another server.  I've already done it a couple times, the leveling is still actually quite fun doing it again.
---
You see my friend, a server is like an onion.
---
It has layers.
---
You know you ain't gonna quit... Even if you don't get in the day AFTER tomorrow. You'll be back to get in eventually.
---
People may not have logged back on  after they went back up? I have no clue I'm just spit balling.
---
But they are so sure the pops will drop.
---
This! We need more of it. Thank you for your thanks.
---
i keep rolling on new servers because i can't get back to my toon from my last play.
---
Good job helping boost your server! I did the same on 2 realms now. Both my accounts have over 90 craft because of offering bags for free. I even bought all the thread myself. People were generous enough to tip each time ! In either silver or spare linen!
---
School doesn't start for another week and a half for my district
---
Mythic azshara has more mechanics in one fight than the entire classic raid boss composition combined. 
---
There isn't a single thing in classic that is as difficult as mythic raiding or high m+ keys. There's only content that takes longer to do. Classic rotation is literally 1-3 buttons pressed over and over. 
---
You're free to prefer classic but don't lie to everyone and act like it's actually difficult at all.
---
Lol if you have any suggestions I'm sure blizzard is listening :) 
---
If all else fails. Reread last response.

Me, clicked through every realm
---
Accept product, and consume, peasant.
---
Ya I got my 3 names as soon as I could and I chose whitemane bc it looked like herrod, faerlina, &amp; thalnos had the most people but now it looks like whitemane is somehow the most popular :/ &amp; I already have the names I wanted. I think blizzard might do character transfers but possibly only for people in full realms to transfer to smaller realms as opposed to the other way around
---
Here’s how we will find out.
---
If blizzard announces sub counts this quarter, classic did what I personally assumed would happen and got them out of the death spiral that started mid cataclysm. 
---
If they don’t, bfa tourism would explain the high queues.
---
Why don’t you just play BfA then you won’t need any interaction with other players at all.
---
Thanks for sharing. I am not happy with the Director reply.
---
I'm just glad Blizzard implemented layering so we dont have to worry about queues.  :(   Now we have layering and worse queues than wow has ever had. FML.
---
Humans, a vile and primitive race
---
I have leveled guys 3x now on new pvp eastern NA servers.  All turn into 10000 ques in evenings.
---
Normally you should be able to roll
---
Sharding is something they created for classic. It sounds like they started calling it layering instead. It is the same thing.
---
I guarantee you everyone is thinking that. Godspeed my son.
---
I did try that, they do the exact same damage.
---
get auto clicker
---
What are you talking about? Being a torch bearer would be so cool. You're literally the light of the party, guiding them through the darkness. Add in the world PvP element with enemies lurking just outside the light and you may actually feel a sense of dread. It's an awesome idea. Hardly practical in an mmo, but it could have been neat.
---
What did he actually fix? That wasnt pressure from above?
---
Layers need not exist in the same physical server.
---
They do the exact same thing, i was testing it last night. I intend to put in a ticket about it when I get into the damn game, but i suggest you do the same.
---
If they keep opening new servers to cater to these crybabies ruining the longterm prospect of Classic because they cant handle queues or short term playability, I will never buy another Blizzard product again.
---
Every 'wahh queue's' post is pissing me off. They are fucking long for a reason, it ensures the longterm survival of the game. Opening these extra servers is already too much.
---
Don’t worry you’ll be able to play in a couple of months when everyone is geared up and your getting ganked, just make sure you leave your subscription on autopay in the meantime.
---
It does, but it's not like Runescape. In WoW, you pick your "world" and then can never leave. It's not like Runescape where you can hop worlds freely. Eventually you will be able to pay $25 to change worlds but that's not in yet.
---
We is taking over. Kitty DPS everywhere.
---
You (wo)man up and play continuously!
---
it's more immersive and nostalgic this way
---
So far everyone Ive run into has been cool and super helpful. It really is like the early days again. Thought it was gone forever, but here we are. :)
---
Mmmmnnnnnaahhhhhh it's growing on me.

meanwhile I got to stand around Zalazane because the spam fest there refused to do a line - spent over an hour waiting to finish the quest.

What’s the wow1 mean?
---
Bye
---
My friends chose Stalagg because of some streamer.... I'd rather be in a normal server.
---
That's short for \[Power Word: Fortitude\] a priest buff that will benefit other players
---
They barely survived.  99% of their goodwill is gone, if vanilla ever ends it will be 100%.
---
yes and this is creating a problem now to dely ... not fix the fracture problem. people still quite after 1 year even if they had crazy queue times early on and the lenght of the queue almost forces an the huge drop off.
---
Duh. They want to see the shit show
---
I'm a lvl 8 warrior going through the exact same situations. I love you all. Thank you.
---
Lol - Twitch viewership as a good metric...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
I thought this was the whole point of layering.  To handle the overpopulation in the beginning.  If they don’t want more servers then at least add more layers.
---
Group up with people.  That is the spirit of classic
---
Priorities my friend...
---
Which server should they go to sorry? https://i.redd.it/p4yd5eavk3j31.png

get a kid to do the waiting for you

Mike wouldnt allow mobile diablo and BFA to continue this way.
---
That's the issue though. We're all committed and we don't know if it's a good choice or not. It super sucks to enjoy the game knowing that.
---
I was about to look up what ability warrior gets at 16, thanks for this.
---
Don't let the #MAN keep you down! You be you!
---
Can write a script in python in 5 lines to make a loop to jump every so often. Acts as though you're clicking the keyboard but not. Just go into RFC and jump away to avoid the afk timeouts and reports.
---
Well shit man. We were 15 when this came out. Now most of us have day jobs. It’s 8 pm and I just finished dinner and sitting down for the night... I can’t just sit in a 4 hour queue... I’m going to be sleeping by then...
---
As much as I agree with you that it's unhealthy behaviour, it's not Blizzards call to make. And honestly, those few people that are playing for 8 hours straight aren't gonna make a dent in the queue.
---
Yeah I made a ticket. They have almost the exact same tooltip, but Rank 2 costs 20 more mana. I'm not sure how this slipped through all the betas.
---
Hey, this is ethanasia. No disconnects and now I'm about to take a powernap. :P Easy.
---
I think they will raise caps slightly.  They should offer free transfers off the ridiculous pop realms though, and limit transfers to lowest pop only.  Also possibly to balance out factions.
---
Make it so every server has a sister. In case it gets too long it'll be merged with the brother and the sister server has to change names
---
Yes, thats what im confused about. People saying they arent haveing the same problem so it must be an addon but im only useing very basic addons
---
Eat my ass and pay my bills?
---

Ion was interviewed by IGN in an article released today saying they would offer transfers to players on dead realms if it became necessary https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/27/world-of-warcraft-director-reveals-why-classic-server-queues-are-still-so-long
---
Honestly if I had to guess it's not going to get better till at least next Tuesday
---
I don't see it. The keyboard?
---
The guild can swap. Its just over 24 hours in. Better to have the guild swap sooner rather than later. Either way you look at it someone is getting “screwed”. 
---
But one of those scenarios results in everyone playing.
---
It was fine this morning, at night it was 2-3 hour queues
---
All you gotta do is get your wife addicted to World of Warcrack and you're good
---
Same on rattlegore stuck at 12 re-queuing puts me back to 12
---
I feel yah. My friends and I are on Grobbulus and the queues are horrendous. They opened another RP-PVP server but it's EST and we're PDT. We're very committed to RP-PVP but there is only one in our timezone T_T
---
When talking about dailies and "chores", sure. But when talking about raids and dungeons, retail is definitely more difficult than classic, where as Classic is mostly hard because of tuning, ergo, takes longer.
---
They did layer, but they're only layering for phase 1.
---
Think of it this way. If a regular old vanilla server is 2k, they currently have 5 layers active. Aka 10k players.
---
Already much bigger than vanilla per server. If they just removed layers, it would be a clusterfuck of lag and players virtually everywhere (which was the case for the first \~30 minutes of launch btw, and it was awful lmao)
---
So now they need to balance between being able to remove said layers to bring the populations back to managable levels (bc they promised to remove them) while also making sure servers are not completely dead when the visitors leave. 
---
If they increased player cap, they'd have to increase layer amount for server stability so players could.. actually find mobs to kill. But since they HAVE to remove them, that goes against what their goal.
---
That’s not at all what that meant. They planned for this perfectly lol they even said this exact same shit like a month ago
---
Highest level player I saw doing /who all 20-50 was a couple level 21s. It takes a long time to get to 60. I'll be impressed if anyone makes it to 60 before Labor Day.
---
Thanks
---
Please no. Transfers ruin server communities
---
interesting... Pretty glaring bug, then.
---
I'll give it a try tonight too. Just pop in a ticket and I'll do the same.
---
You say whine, but that's degrading. And using Hitler? C'mon man it ain't even close to being a reasonable analogy. People are pissed and have every right to be.
---
Lmao..I bet 50% of people just want classic back to troll people. It’s been glorious the past 2 days
---
I tried leveling a warrior once, but it really was a grind so I stopped. Does it get progressively more fun or is it like an end game payoff?
---
Well I'm sorry you don't seem to realize that a company is beholden to it's shareholders. And the shareholders want MORE profits, not "the same as last year" profits. It's all about Growth. Blizzard is owned by one of the greediest publishers in the industry, yet here you are thinking 7 hour queues in 2019 are perfectly acceptable.
---
You might wanna hop on it another 10 hour queue on a different server for more balanced factions
---
r/outside is leaking
---
It's on your Control+V anyways
---
Boo-fucking-hoo.
---
I hope they don't delete thread for such insinuation ;). Bit yeah, I hope people don't miss out on this rare hype mmo launch experience, they only come so often.
---
maybe you should move to china
---
Welcome to classic, where the effects of all the 'I shouldn't have to's over the years have been reverted!
---
"You think you \[can\], but you \[can't\]"  
---
Even the new realms have a nearly 3 hour wait time at peak hours. If people can't login in instantly, or at least have the que times down to half an hour, this will be one of the ugliest game launches I've ever seen and will destroy whatever image Blizzard had left of a respectable company. 
---
Not to mention the burn bridges onto thousands upon thousands of players begging them to take their money.
---
It is and they can't track
---
food looks dank
---
Increase layers and allow more people to log on.  As people drop off, reduce layers.  Clean enough?
---
I throw them a heal whenever they're in combat, and a BoM.
---
China numba one
---
I've yet to be able to login over two days. This is so much fun. What's the chance blizzard prorates my game time?
---
Not queues, it was always the bunch of whining assholes who got terrible changes implemented one by one over the years because they went and constantly bitched and moaned on the forums.
---
We put a man on the moon 50 years ago...'hardware limitations' my ass
---
Not sure how to feel about that hahah
---
I came from OSRS too.
---
It’s fun - a lot of the enchantment of having to do everything from scratch yourself (I am a UIM).
---
Like osrs, there’s no easyscape mechanics that make high level accounts meaningless. Every achievement is real, impactful, and proudly displayed and sought after.
---
The community is also wonderful so far.
---
these people think they would only be 2 steps behind if it weren't for queues lol
---
if you supposedly only have 3-4 hours a day to play, how the fuck are you going to be remotely close to NEETs who aren't even going to log out for 3 weeks straight and are optimizing their leveling routes to hit 60 as fast as possible
---
The social aspect.
---
Given that Blizzard has given indication that this movement is serious (see https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346 ) and assuming they fix the server issues what does everyone want to see for the future? People (and Blizzard) have discussed relaunching previous expansions. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Clearly people who pushed for classic don't want all the previous expansions released the same way as a cursory glance says the consensus is that the experience had a general negative trend as time progressed. So, what do people want for future content releases?
---
congratulations, this is basically the AJATT/MIA technique for language acquisition. use Anki in conjunction with this to solidify some words and you'll be fluent in no time
---
I could probably learn 4 different languages in the time it takes to load into the game
---
For the record. Skarem 12,000 long queue started at 7:00pm...
---
4.5 hours later still 3000 in line.
---
I've literally forgot I was in queue until I was getting ready for bed and noticed the computer was still on.
---
I'm finding a surprising number of people auto-running into walls while &lt;Away&gt;.
---
The would defeat the purpose of the queue lol
---
There is a grace period after logging out which lets you skip the queue upon logging back in. 
---
If you stay logged out for more than 15 or so minutes, you will have to wait in queue again.
---
same, woke up and innediarely logged into a massive queue, did some stuff and come back to no queue popup. infuriating
---
1 word. Peggle.
---
#CAN YOU HEAR US NOW BLIZZARD^^TM ?!?!
---
Layers don’t increase pop count. They just spread them more so not everyone’s fighting for the same mob
---
It's what they did many times with vanilla wow.
---
Computer nerd in the queue line is so hot right now.
---
I jumped servers twice because they warned us of high queues.  Between that and off-peak hours I've mostly been queue free
---
This makes me sad because I literally made this exact same meme with mage water to a healer, and the mods took it down for "low effort".
---
Glad yours got by the inconsistency.
---
He's just sad he's alone.
---
You DID say and/or...
---
I'm gonna eat some of that breaded meat thing on the plate
---
It's bound to happen. Every game has this problem. Naturally everyone wants to play and try the new hotness but only a fraction of them have any intention to stay. Ok we spool up like 50 new servers to get everyone in now. And then in 3 months we have all these servers complaining there's no one to play with.
---
I’m role playing an illiterate orc rogue
---
But how ?
---
It would be very hard to find a computer that cant run classic wow .
---
Fuck im sure classic wow could run on a samsung s10 if the controlls where not horrible .
---
NSFW man! What the hell 
---
/s
---
yeah is OSRS the community polls for additions to the game in spirit of OSRS, so in WoW's case this would be people voting to add stuff in spirit or flavor of WoW Vanilla not going to route of TBC
---
4.5 hour queue for my today before it got too bad. People that joined in like an hour later had twice the queue number I did.
---
Post your time played ;)
---
It seems to be moving much faster now. I wonder what happened? Maybe it's that magical time where everyone needs to go to bed?
---
Pretty sure it’s barrens stonetalon thousand/desolace tanaris felwood ungoro winterspring. Pretty sure that order of zones works fine.
---
Yeah getting a green drop is like exciting.  I (NE war) got a green 2h sword and spent an hour doing the death march run through wetlands to get to stormwind to wield it -_-
---
You just sound so incredibly entitled, read your post again in a week or so.
---
Most of the people are still asleep/starting to go to work
---
Thats the thing. You and the downvoters think im trying to defend Asmond here.  When in reality i was only criticizing people who think they're cool or special because they are against or "hate" whats popular.
---
As a priest me too :)
---
fuck you
---
Lol say it some more buddy. It hurts everytine :)
---
You want a problem to go away by crying at it. Good luck with that. 
---
They did more for this launch than in the past and the devs warned us ahead of time. 
---
If you can do better or contribute than do so.
---
I'd be disappointed in your "friends" too
---
I'm a simple man.  I see a phone pic of a computer screen, I downvote it.
---
Honestly yeah. It's kinda scummy to target something that's offering a service you no longer provide. Like yeah you have the legal right but basically no one on Nostalrius did or wanted to play retail.
---
and shades last night.. "world server is down"
---
\-- sigh --
---
This. Don’t worry about losing the progress of one night in a starter zone, just play the game. 
---
Things are like this at launch, just plan where / when you can and don’t take it too seriously. Maybe try a class you normally wouldn’t.
---
Well he's certainly offering more answers than Blizzard atm...
---
Besides, how hard is it to merge two realms. 
---
Are people emotionally connected to that Realm name it's beyond logic?
---
My exact thoughts ...
---
Most smartphones these days could run it no issue.
---
If  someone still has a PC that cant run WoW honestly i would just chuck that shit in the trash .
---
Wow, didn't know I it had a name. I'll search about this method, thanks!
---
And im very thankful for that
---
Yea but there weren't 28 healthy private servers, and private servers didn't have region restrictions
---
You're doing Elunes work.
---
You deleted a character and someone made a chsracter with that name. Name transfer is pretty fancy way of saying that. 
---
Though a one minute safe period might be good to have.
---
Yea it sucks. Luckily it will go down over time (barring the weekends and other day-of-week-effects). Best suggestion is to use remote desktop to queue in on your phone and enter the game once queue is up remotely, your character will be waiting for you when you get back from work!
---
Literally you were the ppl we spammed QQ to endlessly during vanilla and tbc.
---
Yeah, this. I could be fighting my own mob miles away from the guy, and he will turn towards me
---
Literally did the exact same thing. Deviate Delight isn't too bad at all.
---
would be cool if they just told us currentplayers/maxplayers  like literally every single other online PC game
---
Dwarf Hunter. It has been decided.
---
That's a horrible analogy - the WoW population is concurrently paying to play, but not at their leisure. If you would like to play at your leisure, you can wait or switch servers.
---
Sounds like a good day. Just don't leave the two of them alone together.
---
Yeah I'm noticing lots of things that they took out for seemingly no reason at all including things like sound effects which is a big thing I noticed just walking through stormwind alone. it almost seems as if at some point they tried intentionally to remove anything that was immersive.
---
fwiw, 2014 macbook pro retina runs it on minimum. not very well.
---
WoW runs like utter garbage, what are you even on about.
---
If you're one of the first few you can power level skinning or herbing and spend the first few days after dinging farming devilsaur leather or lotuses and literally never have to grind for gold again afterwards.
---
I could play this game on my god damn TI-89
---
Hunter. They get an adder on all loot rolls. Just remember that hunters are incharge of all pulls in groups and should never wait for healer mana.
---
I see. 20,000 people queues were the norm back in the day?
---
Brah.. lol, that's why my PC doesn't get turned on until the terror is in bed. It's like a trouble magnet. I had the laptop closed on me as well, but I was already in world and it let me right back in.

It's not superior.  It's different.  Some people will prefer one over the other, and gamers have a tradition of being elitist jerks (haha, see what I did there) about their hobby.
---
But the mob is also *2 levels above you*
---
Oh ya. People totally pissed about having a full server who got in and played with friends and aren't sure if their server will die down or not even after transfers. Not sure if tansfering will lead to a full server being dead making all their effort pointless. Ya. Fucking whiners. All why blizzard knew this would happen. By golly those whiners.
---
&gt;Clock shows 3AM/PM
---
literally unplayable
---
Mankirk!
---
r/funnyandsad
---
&gt; only thing they would need to do is make names unique across these server subsets 
---
It's absurd that they haven't arrived at this conclusion yet. Like genuinely absurd, it's such an obvious option. There are already so many games out there that function like this with a different skin on them:
---
\[Server Name\]  
---
\- Shard 1  
---
\- Shard 2  
---
\- Shard 3
---
And so on. The only difference would be that Shard 1/2/3 all have their own server names and can be cemented as their own servers down the track if numbers hold up.
---
I think it's a cool idea, it's only one zone not the whole game - plus you have to play around it which is interesting and breaks the monotony a bit.
---
I have everything installed properly
---
Why use that when a print screen is instant?
---
I mean... play how you wanna play but you're definitely missing out on a lot of good times by restricting yourself so much.
---
Waiting 6 hours im queue smoothed my brain out to the point where I could only communicate in memes and millenial tounge. I am sorry.
---
Why would someone come back for content they aren't even going to be participating in?
---
I watched an ad for you, you're welcome
---
Interestingly they stopped doing this with a lot of objects as they became less relevant. 
---
For instance, a lot of modern moonwells, starting I think in WoD or MoP do not work for the creation of Mooncloth.
---
web
---
So what you're saying is that Herod is the best server.

Ok glad it's not just me or my internet.  I did get DC'd once while I was on my other monitor and went back in so the grace period put me there, but I have noticed battlenet has randomly DC'd when I'm not even in WoW so I'm guessing it's an issue on Blizzard's side we just have to deal with for awhile.
---
I cant tell my sons (7 and 5) why their uncles play girls.... its so they have something entertaining to watch for all those hours... 
---
As a 30yo woman, IRL I only know one other female player. Probably only woman I know who I didnt meet through her SO 🤷‍♀️
---
Man I've got so many "rivals" at the moment. I saw one looking for more for DM while I was still lowly level 12, I've accepted defeat by that guy
---
It will settle down when people get tired of having to change servers to be able to play at all lol, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy
---
I will, in the barrens.
---
Queued from work at 330pm. It's now 1030pm for me and position 1100. Absolutely bonkers
---
Barren's chat was deep and on a whole other level.
---
I literally just said that my understanding of the technicalities are incomplete.
---
I've also said that it's not my frustration as my server doesn't even have a queue. 
---
Literally nothing you've said has been relevant. Seems like you're just trying to defend blizzard for no reason tbh.
---
Could also be the thousands of people in queues who want to do something while waiting. I am assuming BFA didn't have this issue.
---
Lmao I never heard of that. Sad to be a part of. Awesome to see.
---
I saw a guy at level 30 on Fairbanks! It's crazy how fast the Hunters are leveling.
---
This is the argument I keep using. I'm paying a sub to sit in queue for 6+ hours two days in a row. I fully expected launch day to be rough but for it to be just as bad or even worse in some cases the next day just sucks. I refunded my sub until I can properly enter realms.
---
Have you ever played WoW before? This happens. You either ignore it or update your addons till it goes away
---
Thank god I moved to Sulfuras when it opened last night so I could avoid to queues... 
---
oh wait...
---
This was normal in vanilla too, nostalgia tends to make you only remember the positives.
---
I remember plenty of bafflingly stupid conversations back then in Barrens &amp; Ashenvale so maybe just chill out.
---
Sure do type a lot of words for someone who doesn't care.
---
For $40 an outing? Sounds like 1-3 drinks, depending on cost of transportation or parking.
---
Mail takes 1 hour if I remember correctly. Cash is instant though.
---
Did you login this morning at 8AM? Servers were free as a bird.
---
If you have a cup of water and water flowing steadily onto it, it'll take some time to fill up, after which water can only flow in as other water flows out. If you take a bigger cup, it'll take longer to fill up, but once full water will only be able to flow in as other water flows out.
---
If layers are indeed horizontal scaling by plugging extra servers on a realm, then you can see that increasing capacity doesn't actually help if that capacity is still not nearly big enough to house every player. Blizzard can only increase layering to a point. That point is dictated by $$$$.
---
Yeah but it wont prevent the dc , they still get kicked out after a while.
---
I love that movie!
---
Haha well thanks I guess, but I don't think I benefit from the ads at all. Last I checked, this account wasn't partnered.
---
Download the add-one from the twitch client. Never had a problem there
---
It ruined a lot of exploration and world building, and you saw a lot less players, how is that great.
---
They put you in a Que to take your money.
---
Thats fucking  hilarious they must  be making heaps of cash.
---
Awww, is this the first time in your life you're experiencing consequences of your choices?
---
there might not be as many tourist as people think. there's a reason wow grew over the years.
---
Did you switch between 3 Reddit accounts to respond to all this shit? Jesus Christ.
---
Lol well we were winning and they werent. 
---
Whine it up man, I'm here for you. Let it out.
---
Didn't realize how true this was until I checked at exactly 11:30pm and had  9 minutes "remaining" at 4k.
---
Another thing people are missing is that comment was made in 2013. That was early MoP when the game was generally perceived to be in a good state. Demand for classic just wasn't as high at that time. There wasn't even that much outrage over the statement until a few years later when a) we were in one of the most controversial periods of WoW (6.2 WoD) and they just shut down the biggest classic WoW private server.
---
I am bored in queue, I literally got nothing better to do my dude.
---
YOU KIDS GET OFF MY LAWN. 
---
I remember when this place was civilized. 
---
protip: it wasn’t.
---
Moved from stalagg to sulfurus from 10k queue to no que than to it's now full with a 3k queue.. it's something.. I guess.

RIOT!

Vanilla wow was one of the few games in history to grow in size over a 2 year span. It ended with over 4x the number of players that it had after launch. Some of it may be related to the times but I can tell you that most games even in the age of 2004 did not do this. Vanilla wow is a masterpiece.
---
I think some of these people are just a little removed from the Classic that we knew. They will find out soon enough that their anti-social actions will catch up with them when no one wants to party or interact with them.
---
Unfortunately the one thing Blizzard can't recreate from that time is decency. They've done a very good job with what they could recreate though. All we can do is keep logging in, and keep being decent ourselves. Some people try their hardest to be shitty people, we try our hardest not to be. We might not always succeed, but hey, at least we try!
---
will do! any specific ones you would recommend?
---
“Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh wahhhh waaaaaaaahhhhhhhh”
---
All I heard
---
Why the fuck is this comment so funny
---
I was lucky enough to get in bloodsail today
---
Not all phased content is for max level. Like, in P3 when PvP comes out -- everyone is going to want to login and do some WSG. Even in the 10-19 bracket. Or P5 during the gate event, everyone is going to want to contribute and see the gates open. 
---
And folks will be more inclined to play classic during content droughts in retail. That *"well, I'm paying for a sub anyway"* mindset will bleed over for sure. 
---
The more folks that have "main" characters on a large server - the worse the queues will become during phase releases. Especially PvP (p3) and AQ (p5).
---
I agree it's shitty and something needs to be done. I wish there were clean solutions that didn't result in either massive queues or dead servers... Hopefully Bliz can find one.
---
There's something about Classic where people are usually compelled to help eachother. I love it.
---
Except for these two assholes yesterday who were jumping around a copper vein so I couldn't mine it while their friend mined it instead.
---
Idk why I'm getting downvoted. Me and my friends all care about our names. It's just part of what matters to us. Same as making our character look the way we want.
---
You don’t think this multi billion dollar company didn’t think of this...
---
Welcome to Vanilla
---
Because the OP made a blog post
---
Calm down dude. Let's not forget that vanilla WoW was the easy mode baby mmo of its time. Also casual people wanting to play and not having the time or motivation to no life a game, and understandably so.
---
I think they should at least do TBC and wrath. And you should have the option of keeping your vanilla character the way it is or copying it and having that same character progress through TBC.
---
My body is none of your business. I don't see any other games locking you out after 8 hours of play time. If you're going to push a medical agenda as a business you better get ready to lawyer up. As a paying customer , I see NOTHING in the terms of service against extended playtime. If you have an issue with the queues , that's between you and blizzard but keep me out of your squabbles
---
There are no low pop PvP servers. The lowest queue I've found is 90 minutes.
---
Logged onto a 7.7k Blaumeux, 2.5 hrs later, still not in, and the queue counter broke, and says '151' in queue and 2 mins ETA.
---
I was 168 an hour ago.. so moved '17' in yp mins, lol.. wild.
---
You and many others are wrong. There is documented evidence and the popular opinion is that it's a shitshow
---
Yeah maybe dont dismiss my comment like you know what the fuck you're talking about next time
---
Stop with that shit. Vanilla had over 5 million subcribers before TBC, and that was the era of shitty internet and discs required to install.
---
This game is going to be huge.
---
I don't think I am, I already said I interact with people a lot

hamstring is a thing that you have
---
Atleast you're in the game.
---
Eh. I think most of these people will be gone. I put in a ton of time in Vanilla back in the day. And got up to 20. And I'm done with it. I think of the grinds on top of grinds ahead of me. And I just don't want to invest the time in it. Hope everyone else has fun. But it was exactly what I remembered. And while that was awesome at the time...I don't want to do it again. I don't want to play any MMO again.
---
What i do is just log in 11 hours before i want to play. Perfect!
---
15 already.
---
I AM WAITING.
---
You made that trek eh?
---
we rolled on grobbulous last night but kept getting DC/stuck in queue. Deviate hasnt had a queue for me all night which is weird. just annoying to try to convince people to switch
---
We appreciate it druids.
---
I'd like it to progress as an alternate timeline thing. I think it would be important to keep the level cap the same though- or to keep the base, classic content relevant throughout.
---
Not a chance
---
Generic boar&gt;
---
And? Is the game literally unplayable without friends?
---
What happened to "making friends as you play" which is supposedly the most important aspect of Classic, by the way?
---
Best of luck to you two in the fields of Azeroth!
---
Thanks guys but he's stubborn and doesn't want to do any fixes till he gets a new computer so I guess we will just have to wait for queue times to go down to play
---
Thank you! I don't get how so many people don't understand this simple concept!
---
I read somewhere they said they wouldn't do that, but I don't have a link handy or anything.
---
If I recall he's one of the original designers (art maybe) and they put his face as a placeholder for various things.
---
Ok, still won't have 100% retention rate.
---
I'll hate whoever I want, thanks.
---
People did that over the last 2 days too and none of the realm pops changed, so how do you explain the entire list getting changed?
---
I forgot all about the rain I played a little of vanilla but I was like 13 then quit until burning crusade came out 
---
But I do love how the rain looks
---
Some folks like to "complete" the zone before moving on.  There is a certain amount of satisfaction knowing that the job is done, you left nothing behind.
---
Fellow Bigglesworth Horde player here. Troll Priest, the queue is huge currently but I was able to get on smoothly this morning.
---
I came, hard.
---
This is a good pack of basic ones. They’re all legit but you can find them individually through twitch as well. 
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/addons/addons-pack-starting/

That's an amazing solution to an annoying problem, I wish you the best of luck (and queue times)!
---
This morning at around 8 am EST one of my server's world first attempters was at level 26. The #2 slot was 23. That was well over 12 hours ago. If I had to guess, he's in his mid 30's.
---
Ahmp on Stalagg btw.
---
You too :)!
---
Hootie..... hootie the strigid screeched!
---
I introduced my husband to WoW. He has issues playing it (i.e. addiction like issues)
---
I'm trying to decide if the marriage counseling is worth playing with him... because Vanilla WoW is pre-husband days for me 🤷‍♀️
---
Maybe I'll just play while he's at work....
---
Why would anyone use that
---
My exact experience
---
You may be surprised to find out that: they make more than 1 server.
---
I leveled to level 17 last night and everything felt layered down maybe too much. Realm is Fairbanks so no shortage of players. But there was no need to make queues for quest mobs at any point. I went NELF and some areas has no people yet dynamic respawning so I just mob farmed some levels. 
---
I'm just curious if other people's layer was as chill as mine.
---
lmfao
---
These fools actually project that wow classic will do worse than retail. What brains they lack.
---
Blessing of Might for all the warriors and rogues, hoping they remember my name for the future
---
I agree with you for the most part, but what do you think is going to change in a few weeks when it will "all be behind us"?
---
Doubt it. While afternoons/evenings are really bad it seems like it's already normalizing during off hours. I just logged on EU at 3am and saw that every realm is either medium or low when just yesterday on launch it was all full or high, very few medium.
---
It'll be bad for a few days and this weekend but it seems like it'll go down considerably.
---
Sweet
---
lol true!
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot is good if you're looking for quickest routes and no immersion. You kind of hand over your characters destiny for a bit since you just follow the arrow. (it even tells you when to go buy skills lol)
---
Also perhaps grab ElvUI (very intuitive UI, I've used it for as long as I can remember) and Details (Damange Meter)
---
That's about all you need for now.
---
"Certain parts of the world deviate from classic principles, therefore it's impossible to make them compatible".
---
There's some close to level 30 tonight on Grobb (on both horde/alliance).
---
Blizzard doesn’t have to do shit they just gave you a free game. Get over yourself bud. Play on a different server, super easy. And “I don’t want to, I wanna be on the long queue one” kinda invalidates your whole argument.
---
I respect this shit .
---
This guys in the empire business
---
So far I just have questie and prat.
---
2:58pm*
---
It's just misplaced hate at the servers being shit right now.
---
I honestly dont remember a time that Blizz didnt fuck up a launch so I'm being optimistic.
---
Also 13.  Bought a 6 slot then dropped a 6 and an 8.  Feel like a god.  Stoked for 5 days off starting tomorrow.
---
What's the point of that macro, that's what that ability does already, no?
---

Stabling a pet is just like putting it aside. if you want to tame a cool looking new pet without saying goodbye to your current one you will have to stable it first.

Your first mistake was using a meme generator
---
1-40 is about the same as 40-60 based on EXP.
---
It's also slightly more difficult to get that xp around level 50 so that portion can take a bit longer.

i would not have it any other way
---
I tried to log in at 7:30pm EST and was just over 8k. All the people fed up with queues and the people who didn't get in at all yesterday rolled there. Tomorrow Blizzard will urge Krom plagers to roll on the new EST PvP server - which will be full by Thursday night.
---
To be fair, it's full of non-rp players which is a bit annoying, but I'll let it slide for a week or two.
---
Too much vitamin water :(. Taking a break from the Mountain Dew.
---
Yep. How quickly times change. I got in without a queue 8 hours ago. At 2030 I got d/ced eating dinner and couldn't get back on until 2300.
---
Damn I need the source on this song
---
Lmao same buddy
---
No, I just love this response to, and desire for, the early days of WoW and a different style of MMORPG’s. It’s inconvenient, it’s also cool.
---
theres a RPPVP server Deviant Delight that is only medium population.
---
43-44 is about the half-way mark XP-wise
---
 wait, is that to say that if this dude showed up with his 21 accounts he could mine that node 21 times?
---
 what the fuck have they done to retail
---
Aka you're a classic fan that is hoping for BC and wrath to follow.
---
Night Elf starting zone! Was so cool to see everyone piling in.
---
Pretty good?? She's so far behind. Xiao is level 43 already and there are 3 others over 40. Many people are also high 30s.
---
The hotfix to the server population labels only happened around 7pm eastern / 4pm pacific USA.
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
increase pizza size, and cut it into sizes that are similar to the original sizes
---
20 minutes for light dinner book, that is all.
---
Love this idea. WoW progression servers. Have some servers that are classic only and will never upgrade, have others that progress to the next xpac over time.
---
They blue posted this yesterday;
---
"I understand the frustration: Anticipating and planning around jumping back into this world we’ve all missed, only to be stuck in a long queue, is not the experience we want anyone to have.
---
But from the start of planning for this launch, we’ve tried to prioritize the long-term health of our realm communities, recognizing that if we undershot the mark in terms of launch servers, we could move quickly to add additional realms in the opening hours. But if we went out with too many servers, weeks or months down the line we’d have a much tougher problem to solve. While we have tools like free character transfers available as a long-term solution to underpopulated realms, everything about that process would be tremendously disruptive to realm communities, and so it’s something we want to avoid as much as possible.
---
Thus, we took the path of launching with few enough realms to still thrive in the event that our most conservative estimates ended up proving accurate, while having enough servers ready to activate at a moment’s notice if needed. And clearly they were, and are, needed.
---
We’ve released over 20 new realms worldwide so far since launch, and we’ll be up around the clock continuing to do so until everyone who wants to experience Classic is able to. But even still, as we bring new realms online in a given region, we wait for them to fill before opening new ones, because we want to make sure that each and every realm has a healthy population in the long term."
---
Not trying to defend them in anyway, just passing on the message.
---
I mean, it's not like they want this, it's just that they're banking on things smoothing out in the next couple of weeks so they're not left with a ton of dead servers, and so they won't have to start merging realms or doing cross realm stuff.
---
what you do when interface addons are out of date, any good site that keeps them updated?
---
He was the developer responsible for making all the icons
---
There are no grace periods, because the DCs are intentional. This is how they rotate players and force queue movement.
---
"winning" lol, you aren't very bright
---
As long as you are leveling, I see nothing wrong with leveling multiple toons. I can't even login and I just got my hunter to lvl 10.
---
On retail. Account 1, 10 alchemists, 7 engineers, I used to have every profession, but skinning/lw is not as profitable as making sky golems every 30 days.
---
On account 2. I think I have 7 alchemists.  But no active sub to check.
---
Nothing wrong with having every single profession maxed out to always know a good buy.
---
They would ruin the game.  Layers in Phase 2 with world bosses would be an absolute disaster for the game, and even in phase 1 where people start getting 60 it's also really terrible for the game.  
---
They have servers filled with like 12k concurrent core players... you can't have that going forward. 
---
If anything they're stuck the wrong way, with servers too high pop for the game to handle without layering.
---
We will see if she trades me for a guy with thunderfury late game. That may be the case!
---
They're already designed to to hold something like 12k. 
---
Only way to accommodate that many is to have tons of layers and you can't just keep adding layers because they can't handle that many copies of the world assets being loaded.

---
You should stop missing when you attack. For that you should level up.
---
So, once the game has been out for a while, is it possible we could expect expansions or some other form of new content? I’m a total noob so forgive me if that’s a stupid question. 
---
I just think once the game has been out for quite some time blitz will want to add more to keep players interested; but does that fuck with the whole classic thing?  
---
I’m not sure what to expect so I just thought I should ask!
---
Haha no they will not.
---
Back in 2005 if you got scammed it was your fault end of story itshould  be the same.
---
This aint 2019 retail wow lol wtf .
---
I got in after a 6 hour queue today. I played for one hour and it logged me out. I have another 6 hour queue now.
---
Enhance shaman
---
Whoops, sorry for having an opinion. I should have known Blizzard is waiting with bated breath for whatever I say to implement it immediately. It's not like there are ways to poll a community and see where their interests largely lie.
---
Can't even properly link this is the type of dude who sits in a line for the quest
---
Layering isn't meant to eliminate queues. 
---
The only way Blizzard will ever meet the community's demand to turn off layering is by sticking to their guns on this and adding servers as they fill up. 
---
They could ramp the layering up to let more people in, but then no one on the big servers rerolls and you're left with a server that can't be sustained on a single layer.
---
Enhaman.

I was surprised she wanted to try it. She hasn’t been interested in other games.

Oh it already has a negative effect. I'm hoping these players eventually leave, but I'm not optimistic.

That's what I am definitely hoping for. I've played since Dec 2004, but my all time favorite has always been WotLK. &lt;3
---
Rip bud.
---
When was in game shop added?
---
Well played, that's weird to see an edit of my edit.
---
If you find something, keep us posted please
---
I can't even imagine what it would be like without the layering. They would have had to roll out what 50 server to even be close to the capacity they have right now.
---
I was in queue for 8 hours today. Played minecraft with the homies during the queue had a great time. I love classic wow!
---
He had a whack load of viewers on day 1 tho, im sure he could of made a decent chunk of cash off the run on twitch. But honestly i never expected joana to be even close to world first, alot of people (retail streamers esp) vastly underestimated private server players, alot of these guys have leveled 1-60 20 times over in the last few years.
---
Just get teamviewer or some other free remote software on your pc, and on your mobile and log in earlier. Might be a bit tricky if you are not tech savvy but it's not extremely complicated.
---
It is a launch environment. Everything will calm down before you know it. Calm down with these posts.
---
Pray to RNGesus
---
I bought another copy of the game so I could do this. Although I’m in classic in both. My main is going to be on a high pop w long queues so I’m playing alts on low pop servers while waiting.
---
I just want to see some qol updates like a comprehensive quest tracker and being able to pick hair color for Tauren. Other than that, I like the pacing and mechanics.
---
We expect half these fuckers to stop playing by level 40....so this is the answer you must all live with.
---
bro you cant defend this, people are currently waiting in 4+ hour queues for realms that were made today. there are an abundance of ways they could fix the issue without sacrificing the long term health of servers.
---
You still have to hop out to cast, right?
---
They’re still really long during prime time.  I played this morning at like 11:00AM with no wait at all, but later in the day it was back to the multi-hour queues.

The problem is your level. 10 is way too low for any class to be doing dungeons.
---
put down something to hold down w and d inside of a dungeon
---
And layering was their proposed solution to that. Clearly layering isn't working out very well or they don't have enough layers.
---
Same! Up to that is fine with me! And not to start whining but some qol changes would be nice so I don’t need a metric ass ton of addons to make the game less difficult, I guess that’s the wonder in it tho
---
Me with arcane intellect
---
I'll eat a shoe if even the lowest pop servers are still like this after a week. It's not going to be like this for much longer.
---
Just use the twitch client for addons! Assuming it has what you’re looking for.
---
Ok they also added more days before launch, during launch and again toady
---
Why specifically the left one?

Tourists leaving isn't a sign of failure, it's an inevitability that almost everyone expects. I think most people think Classic will be a great success, don't think anybody thinks the tourist players will stick around. Blizzard have spent years pondering how they will fix the problem that the initial launch would be massively popular but then drop off considerably.

I plan to stick around until I hit 60 and then be a fair weather player for phase releases. I would love to be able to play Classic with a passion but like many others that's not really realistic with life, that's different to a tourist. Already seen plenty of tourists quit before they get out of Elwynn Forest, may before they get out of Northshire.
---
Worrying about Blizzard thinking "you don't want it" is a bit silly at this point when the game is already out, they were convinced when they announced it.
---
I think there was always some kind of shop for wow but at the start it was purely cosmetic stuff, and just became more and more each expansion
---
My computer can not take a screenshot
---
I just ran by you two with my priest buddy in kharanos close to 30 mins ago.
---
It is their game, I think they can do almost whatever they want.
---
There's a few lvl20s on my server already
---
I agree with you, but even if it *is* true that it was all a PR stunt, he still ate crow and admitted he was wrong in front of everyone.
---
If MT came into classic there would be riots in the streets.
---
Playing WoW on a Mac reeeeeeeee
---
Lol 69 min wait time that’s the sex number
---
I changed layer when grouping up once. Other than that, no. Brilliant system
---
Paid money to play the game, can't play the game because of choices game designers made.  It's that simple.
---
The dead pet didn't appear. I tried using dismiss pet anyway and it still says that I don't have a pet.
---
I’m using a 2015 MBP. Why are you running wow in windows? It runs great natively on macOS
---
They changed it like 3 hours ago. It's now relative to the max server population.
---
Eh my friend does 5 boxing for fun. He doesnt do it for gold or what have you. He does his own instances with 5 shamans. It's fun to watch. Not all of them are gold farming.
---
Because they said that they *will* remove layering before phase two. Do you *really* want a potentially 100,000 player multi-day queue in phase 2?
---
journey the first to sleep hopefully this will get updated tomorrow
---
Anyone wanna be friends on Whitemane? Horde, name is Popdukes
---
Laugh, look up the scene, cry again, look up, and ask why not both?
---
Yep Blizzard really screwed up the launch
---
and it's meaningful in Vanilla. You can truly feel the difference as you level up, and it's so rewarding when you get an item upgrade in a slot that was lagging behind. Your effort doesn't feel pointless. It just doesn't have that same feel in retail anymore, and a big part of it is because you have to get through 120 levels
---
I'm not playing atm, wanna wait for the buzz to die a bit ... But I still somehow feel like this is me
---
Probably the best time in the last 10 years or so. There is huge activity. Everything is reset effectively. No 'past' expansions to level through.
---
Lol I havent sat in a single queue soooooo nah
---
Haven't played enough to notice. ( leaving mulgore tommorow) but I'm also a solo player so I won't run into some of the common sightings
---
Ha, we all know what happens in this inn
---
I know blizz is defending it but their decision to limit servers is seemingly backfiring. They are losing a lot of interest from non-hardcore people.  Myself included. A few hours waiting in queue ona NEE server to play with friends. The server is so overcrowded that you can barely tag mobs and can’t quest.
---
I know i have it on mac os aswell but my mouse is so slow for some reason and tried going into terminal to expand the max speed and it justwont work so now im using bootcamp because the mouse works fine
---
No please dont leave pleeeease stay
---
how many friends are you playing with and are you playing on a PVP server
---
It’ll change over time, if you aren’t able to be patient you’ll never make it past 20; let alone 60.
---
Which game is that?
---
Would that be in the spellbook? I didn't see a panel in there
---
What time of the day do you play?
---
I’d say you see j Allan Barack step down as president after this all has blown back in his face , if I understand correctly he was still even up to the release of classic saying he didn’t think it would work
---
5 and Ashkandi
---
Maybe it's because I'm not a one of the hip pvp realms, but the longest I've waited so far is like, 5 minutes.
---
Names. Imagine thousands of people on a server having to get merged to another one and every single one of them more than likely has to change their name.
---
I do all my cooking on the basement bonfire by the warlock trainers in Stormwind.
---
The secret ingredient is madness. ;)
---
I wonder how it feels like to be him
---
thats a normal realm
---
Odd, why the hell isn't this more popular?
---
Eu had 20k+ queues on the 5 most popular servers, along with a 2-6k queue on every other server, even the ones made after release.
---
I just want enough time to get through naxx this time around.
---
Whitemane gang
---
That’s a really roundabout solution.
---
Blizzard can see how long players are online for. If it's 24 hours+ it looks fishy and in the past A GM would whisper you to see if you respond. If not you get the boot and probably a suspension/ban. They could have other ways of telling now too.
---
Herbs &gt; ore &gt; fish &gt; leather
---
Yes, I was displaced into a different layer and the people I was adventuring with awkwardly vanished
---
Did you finish the required quest to get the pet abilities like revive? 
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=982
---
Hah yeah man that one killed me
---
Well you’re not supposed to see it, as you’re assigned to a layer when you login and you’ll most of the time be assigned to the same layer.
---
But, I asked a tailor in trade chat to make me some bags - he invites me to a group, and when I accepted I “phased” to his layer
---
&gt;697 MS
---
Big oof
---
He also invested in Catapults for some reason which came really in handy, some 12+ years later!
---
heh...only 4 hours
---
Theres not that many servers, and if there was anyone higher, someone would speak up with proof.
---
Try this; it has stablized my connection.  I found it online.  Click the blizzard logo in battlenet, go to settings, general, and then uncheck the box at the bottom that talks about hardware acceleration.  I don't want to jinx it but I've been stable for the last hour or so since doing that.
---
Lol this is truly not what it's like right now though. I'd say this is actually pretty rare. I've died countless times now where people just watched. This idea that people are helping each other out to the nth degree more than retail is pretty bogus. For now at least, seems like people just as shitty as ever.
---
LEVEL 18
---
Buried under memes
---
I've literally never, in my life seen this. And I played launch night.
---
Personally idc
---
Heroes of the storm is a free game, Starcraft 2 - WoL is a free game, WoW classic isn't a free game, it requires a subscription fee in order for you to play it.  It's not as simple as "just play in another server, lul u dun wan it", people planned where to play with their friends/guilds considering location/realm time according with the information that was available at the time, people have already invested some hours (with all the difficulties in doing so)  on their characters. My realm wasnt even high pop before launch and here we are, so excuse me if I don't agree with your whole "lul just play in another realm ez".
---
I'm assuming because it has the word White in it.
---
Yes, had to invite someone to my party so I could trade with them in IF, they appeared out of thin air upon joining the party.
---
There can only be one
---
lol my entire WoW classic experience so far has been me listening to lofi hip hop and autoattacking mobs with a staff as a warrior, its fantastic
---
And we finally get to play classic wow so in a way we win too.
---
Carry on, fellow paladins
---
I live in the Oceanic region.
---
I reserved my name on a US PvE server that had high pop when everything else was full (what the hell is this classic obsession with PvP?). This was two days before launch and before they released more servers. I did this because most of my friends in the EU play on NA servers so they can play with us Oceanics.
---
Because I work during US peak time (because Australia is in the future mate), I completely avoided the whole queue crush and frustration. When I booted up when I got home last night, most realms were showing 'low'. Including the one I picked. No queues. It was great.
---
I only realm hopped back to the Oceanic servers just because I like doing my own thing. And even then, the realm I chose here was 'low'. Still no queues.
---
If you don't mind approx 250ms pings, play on an Oceanic realm for a while if you're in the US. Just to get your feet wet. You'll get on because it's off peak time for us and we all sleepin'. When it calms down a bit in a week or so, you can probably go back to your US servers with no queues.
---
People may want to start thinking of more complex ways to drive progression that doesn't nullify past expansion's content. The invasion of Outland is cool but seperating players from each other isn't.
---
Yup, a big part of vanilla isn't necessarily about the end game. Twinking was fun in vanilla. But not only that fully exploring areas and doing all the quests that reaped special rewards not everyone had. Retail has so much in it now that's it's hard to know what's special and who just bought that mount in the store.
---
It wasn't in Vanilla, but getting my blue proto drake was a MONUMENTAL moment for me. Busting it out made me shiver with glee
---
is there anything I can do? besides burn my mac
---
"higher ups not wanting to admit they were wrong."
---
So they are deliberately sabotaging it? You are directly accusing high ups at Activision Blizzard of securities fraud?
---
Curse was godly, Twitch destroyed it, especially curse voice
---
Wow where did you get that?
---
you arnt going to have 3k on a server that has 50k players trying to get on it.
---
People that drop off after a few days are known for sticking around in queues for 4 hours +. 
---
What are quests like then?  About 1:3 quests I try to do they are heavily camped and undoable
---
Except Classic happened IN SPITE of him. He is a fucking moron that sucks dick good enough to be made president of the company.
---
Once again Blizzard has somehow managed to go against feedback and fuck up a perfectly good opportunity.
---
That makes sense, but my real question is why do they want to remove layering? I don't understand the disadvantages, but there must be some if we are trying to avoid it.
---
The obvious advantage being that people don't have to be split up from friends.
---
Remember when people were saying it was dumb to take PTO from work for launch because the servers would be unplayable? Now those same people are complaining because they can't get on to play.

I might have to join an RP Realm. I'm a huge PVE fan and usually like to community build, it can be a little exhausting on PVP servers.
---
The pet might have gotten upset with you and left.
---
But did you log off in between? Because then you’d be sick in the queue I would think.

Yea, I mean it's not like people are paying subscription fee or anything. Oh, wait...

sure m8 just go to the official forums and check there, we have waited for this forever and they underrated our hype, now we are paying to watch a que screen. i come back from work and there is a 4h que to the server my friends play(which is morgraine we already swapped 3 times....), i cant play, wasnt i scammed? i go to bed, go to work, return and i cant play again... amazing stuff.   
---
while everyone knows that free character transfers and tons of new realms is the answer, "at least a temporary solution", blizzard is just throwing out 1-2 new servers and expect your whole guild/friends to move again, only to see its not enough again...   
---
ohh we are being scammed alright, and its not a matter blitz cant do it, its a matter they squeeze every penny at our expense offcourse, we are paying for a service and we dont even get it just for them to earn more profit.
---
All type of gamers should be rejoiced, except mobile P2W shit.  Fuck that.
---
I wisdom hunter might the pet.
---
Do cities have layering? They seem like ghost towns.
---
What’s the difference? People are doing anything they can do to not wait in queue for 8 hours.
---
OP may very well be right.... This used to be a website feature that was then removed and baked into the retail game client. It never existed in that manner before in vanilla. They probably have to redevelop it and test it on the website again.
---
A quest tracker would take away the idea of reading quests. So I don’t think that would ever happen.
---
Macro them genetically and they will auto be max rank
---
I mean at least they aren't rude...

They are just really hardcore roleplayers and wanna relive the days of taking pics with their nokia bricks!

Spot on, I don't understand why this concept is so difficult for people to grasp.
---
Nice! On the other hand [my husband ](https://imgur.com/a/l5aMjbf) was done before he hit level 3.
---
thanks I'll try that
---
The more appalling thing was that 154k people were watching him sit in que during this. I get that most of those people were in que as well but you'd think you'd wanna do something other than watching someone else in que too.
---
It should be illegal? Lmao
---
Even worse is, when the queue is this long, chances for a DC while leaving the PC unattended rise before a login lol
---
Granted, there are a lot of not-RP friendly names around. There is also a big disparity in quality between say, Durotar general and Mulgore general. For whatever reason, Durotar chat is a cesspool compared to Mulgore’s. every cool player I’ve met who seemed RP friendly has been a Tauren or an undead, though I’m sure many cool orcs and trolls abound. Just haven’t met them yet.
---
I had this earlier, sometimes when you alt tab it thinks the alt button is still pressed.  Press it and ctrl/shift a few times to reset them
---
It's great because everyone else goes swords. More great for you to PvP in.
---
a true classic experience
---
well, clearly if it doesnt effect you and only effects millions of other people its a non-issue. good talk
---
She just has a big heart lol

People are also still sleeping on Gyazo. One key combo to take screenshot (or record a gif) and upload it and spit out the link for it.

There used to be guides to get to level 60 in 7 days /played. I'd consider that the minimum time it'd take unless a few private server vets have improved the route (which is highly possible).

Expect people to reach 60 in 2-3 weeks, give or two a few days.

Big if true.

The wowhead one updates so slowly.

1-2 hour Q times are acceptable I think most people assumed it would be that way when they let multiple servers hit full, But 5-8 hour Q times and with the weekend coming up, GFL

Imagine being a grown adult and calling anonymous people “kiddies”, then engage them in an argument after speculating they might be children.
---
Why would an adult feel compelled the need to defend his stance to possible children, let alone random reddit-users that are possibly trolls? 
---
Let alone, on the internet. In a forum for World of Warcraft. In 2019(15 years after the game released).
---
Let that sink in.
---
Don’t know you but thats a yikes from me, my man.

How would you feel if you signed up for netflix and there was a 35 minute wait?
---
Not a bad idea. I'm at a work conference out of town now and will be unavailable until Saturday. Hoping it will die down a bit, or a resolution will be made. If not I'll consider this k. Saturday. Haha.
---
None. Joined Rattlegore from the beginning and had a pleasant day 1, never any queue times. Today it had a healthy population, is full, and only about a 20 min wait time. Not a bad start. Folks having issues are dealing with the insane servers.
---
yes on the tukui site there is a classic version
---
No, the paladin revamp patch 1.9 actually made them even worse at it than they were at launch. Not having taunt isn't even the biggest reason.
---
No worries! I made a similar mistake recently on a pserver. Happy travels in Azeroth.
---
you're just wrong about that. it still effects people that have moved 4 times already.
---
All apple computers run hot, especially in bootcamp. 
---
I am playing a brand new Mac Mini and i could bake an egg on it after6h queue time.
---
It will survive ^^
---
ahhaa it worked!@!!!!
---
Those haven't been updated for almost 10 hours.
---
satellite net
---
Can't wait for what is legitimately going to be greater than 24 hour queue for faerlina this weekend
---
62 and counting
---
Probably because the servers restarted for  maintenance at 7 am
---
I am leveling a priest first with either herb or mining paired with Tailoring.
---
At first I was going to make my alt a rogue but I have also been thinking of going Hunter as my second with Engi Mining (especially if I just mail it all the stuff I mine on my priest).
---
It is definetly one of the easiest to level and it will be nice having a pure dps to switch to when I get tired of healing. 
---
Rogue is my second choice as I am going to be pvping a lot (in the world and especially Phase 3 with BGs). It is the opposite side of the leveling spectrum, it sucks but its so rewarding when you make it to cap and again I could be an engineer for extra pvp shenanigans. 
---
When I played retail vanilla I mained a Resto Shaman with a Warrior as my second and I have no interest in that grind again.
---
I'm from Moonguard.  How's the server treating you?  Or is it too early to tell?
---
&gt;To finish things off, make sure your party isn't going balls to the wall with DPS and heals (yes, even healing causes threat). This will shift threat all over the place, making your life hell.
---
This is pretty much my first crack at tanking Deadmines in a nutshell. I was level 18 (highest in the group), and every single pull was the same. I'd trigger the pack (either pull with a spell or run up), and get maybe one lazy swipe with a paw before every DPS would cut loose. Mobs would be flying everywhere. I felt continuously rage starved, even getting off one swipe felt like an accomplishment.
---
What do you recommend for snap aggro on pulls? HoT myself between pulls even if at full health? Get to 10 rage ASAP and demo roar? Once I had a mob parked I could establish and hold aggro fine, but it was constantly a mess on the pull.
---

He probably hasn't logged off (or left his computer) since an hour before launch.

I love people who think they've made an original post doing this.

Almost EVERYONE has made this comment with a queue pic at this point.

I like how people on Reddit are smart ass dumbfucks with narrow views of the world.  
---
Maybe posting screenshots with a phone is just easier?  Maybe they don’t use reddit from a PC?  I don’t. 
---
Also, the print screen button is so ridiculously 20 years ago.
---
Yep there is no perfect class at everything, it's always a compromise between easy solo play (dps) or easy to find groups (tank, heals).
---
Uhuh
---
It feels so damn good because you can immediately feel the impact of having better gear in classic
---
I agree with you OP(you can see it on a comment I made earlier), blizzard definitely did something.
---
hopefully it lasts and not just a 1 week event
---
oh man that zoomed over my head haha. I just learned about that recently so i wanted to share. buffs for everyone!
---
Aaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuggggggghhhhhh.       Huuuuuuhhhh huuuuuuuuh
---
Any idea what the default is?
---
Well, remember, they told us we didnt really want this.  They really thought we were crazy.  Theyre so disconnected from their player base.  Theyre blinded by microtransactions.
---
Its like going to a TMobile store and asking for the new samsung, and they try to explain to you why you dont realky want a samsung.  They try to sell you on the iphone, explaining how thats what you meant to say.  They continue insisting that you surely must have no clue what your desires are if you want a samsung.
---
Im so overjoyed that 150,000 people are in queue.  Im sad you have to waot, but thrilled that blizzatd has to eat their own words.
---
Yes, damnit, we really did want classic.  For you to assume we just "thought we did, but we dont" is disrespectful ebtirely to the game that built your empire and fortune.
---
Classic wow is why you are at the position you have today, because it was greatness.
---
Thank you for bringing it back.
---
I was doing the hunter pet quest and some butthole warlock came by and threw up a dot on my target and kept running, if you see this and you’re that guy fuck you.

Earlier when I asked if she was ready to pay she told me she had to finish great british bake off first. Our priorities were clearly not aligned.

I won greed roll three times in a roll last night questing with a small group and they kicked me after the third won roll. Lol

Some realms were down for days at a time in the 2004 launch from what I heard.  That seems worse.
---
you can still only fit a certain amount of pizza in a box

Only in gaming industry you can pay for something and have white-knights shit on you for pointing out that it is actually unacceptable to take money for a service you fail at providing. But yes, drones will drone I guess

Sorry I meant software to stay online.

Sounds about right. Too bad a lot of newbros are coming in and trying to ruin stuff. The game does feel like home though. Glad to have you.

Alt f4 is not necessary. Can exit in the normal way
---
I'd prefer to come out with BC servers in addition to Classic and allow us to copy our characters. That way we can maintain our vanilla experience and play BC too.
---
I'm not gonna sugar coat this.  If I know anything about the future of Azeroth, it is that the Alliance ***is*** racist.
---
Shh stfu why give tips
---
Doesn't work though, actually. Running it at 1080p, it blows its horn 5 seconds after starting, no matter what I set the timer to.
---
Hahahahahahahahahah I’m fucking dying of laughter lol
---
Yea lotta salty people who refused to switch from herod
---
Give it a week at least. See how things level out. WoW launches usually go this way but no xpacs as of late have been this popular at launch.

That's goddamn stupid.

I’ve had it in both retail and classic for months now and can’t seem to find a fix

DPS wise it wont measure up. Dagger spec and Sword spec are what I remember raiders being

I've notices so many screenshots is taking with phone cameras. Why is that? Why isn't people using the printscreen button on the keyboard?
---
All of my guild mates log in remotely at lunch and play after they get home from work

I am sure the regular RP servers will accommodate the serious RPers.
---
Pvp tends to bring these types of people. Sorry.
---
You see guys, it's all rose tinted and nostolgia that WoW Classic is running off of.
---
You're the one who moved the goal posts, the original post I replied to never mentioned leveling at all. 
---
Also every single raid tier has new mechanics we haven't seen before. Only now the mechanics are actually difficult.
---
Come back in a week. Less qq, more pwnin.

I recommended my friend do the same week or two before launch, as people before launch will be trying to do the same, when it is already too late. He bought few tokens.
---
Whoa. This exact thing happened to me at level 12 and as a warlock
---
There is some truth to this. Had my internet go out on me and was able to set up my phone as a hotspot and get right back in.
---
I thought multiboxing wasnt allowed in pvp
---
I was playing daoc when wow was released, got to like 30 in wow before going back. Now with classic relaunch ita like going back to where i left off. Its pretty surreal. But god damn do i miss daoc.
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
The only ban I ever got in wow was from making a joke about Steve Erwin on a RP server I was checking out.  I never went back.
---
Why not choose to just join a server with less to no queue time? I've been playing on one of the last added PvE servers in EU and the longest I had to wait was 15 mins. I can understand that you want to play with friends but if they aren't willing to relocate they are just dumb.
---
Im gonna upvote this for upvoting the guy 2 msgs above for having on reddit and upvoting the guy not complaining about queues
---
This is what game launches are often like. It's normal. It's extra tricky with WoW. They can't reasonably make 500 servers for the launch hype and then have everybody spread thin in low pop servers sooner or later. This will all blow over in a matter of days. The way they are approaching this is the smart play, regardless of the emotions we feel when we want to play and are met with "480 minutes remaining" on our screens.
---
No doubt!
---
Once you're past the pack you just need to stay ahead so there's no competition for mobs. I could see someone doing it in 5 days /played but they're gonna have to sleep at some point so finishing before Labor Day seems nearly impossible.

You might run into some problems, check your specs verses the minimum specs for classic. Vanilla WoW ran on a different engine entirely, so the required specs of 15 years ago are not the same as the ones now.

That being said, it can run on some older hardware. Just double check first.

---
I'm on Kurinnaxx. Waited a measly 15 minutes to log in.
---
I would go ahead and switch now. It’s likely to be full for weeks as the streamers play.
---
Yeah, I think the removal of any RPG elements really hurt the game.  It's one of those elements people think they don't care that much about until they're gone.
---
It’s been mostly pleasant on Grobbulus. I’ve been RP pretty heavy and no one has been rude yet!
---
Someone got a random bag drop and the whole zone got excited for them
---
When my first 6 slot bag dropped, it felt amazing.
---
frost resistance or res sickness
---
Yea, No changes!
---
At that point you only had the first maxed server pop with leveled characters. The remaining 12k in queue hadnt committed anything at that point and moving would be fine.
---
Nope, just go in blind and ask questions in game. It’s better that way. 
---
I would give anything to be in your position right now, to learn everything in classic fresh.
---
I wasnt even planning on trying it out, but I decided "hey, why not right?" I got into smolderweb and there were like 200 people massacring every kobold in Norhshire valley. It was insane.
---
70% spanish, 20% people bitching about people speaking spanish. 10% hahaha/jajaja
---
You god damn saint you!!!
---
It depends on the kind of quest item. If its something like bring the head of this dude you killed, then everyone in the party should always be able to loot it. If its something like kill a scorpids to get a bunch of stingers, then only one person can loot each quest item
---
I am just going to remote desktop from work and login, its surprising how many people aren't doing this
---
Please don't leave we need you
---
Legion and BFA had great launches.  A lot of people figured they grew.
---
True. I think the layering is massively helping with that. I have to say the world does seem low populated though. I think I'm just on top of the curve. But I barely have contested mobs.
---
&gt; hat the default 
---
Pretty sure the default is 1.
---
and they open up new realm left and right - but still no new rp-pvp realm. they're geniuses.
---
The top of the line GPU at the time was the $400 GeForce 6800GT, which is below the minimum requirements for Classic.  
---
The first 64-bit consumer processors came out in the latter half of 2004.  64-bit is a requirement for Classic.  
---
Only the most cutting-edge gaming PCs from 2004-2006 would have any hope of running Classic, and it certainly wouldn't be a good experience.
---
That's great!
---
The people complaining about spanish speakers are so lame.
---
I'd advise choosing a different server.
---
Cant wait will probably start subscription today but will sadly have to wait cuz tests suck. Thanks for the advice.
---
Deviate Delight is a great server so far, and no queue all night.
---
And a shoe!
---
Bad trolling
---
Last night was great. Can't remember last time i typed this much in wow. Felt just like old times, just a bit more memes and way more funny names.
---
Had a blast
---
there's a bunch of new servers they told people to go to instead before the release.
---
people din't go there, now they have long que times
---
Did you actually change your spell out?  They don't automatically upgrade when you learn a new level.

rip
---
That's not an excuse, that's a must.
---
Oof, I was definitely trying to avoid streamers lol. At least most of the big streamers went to faerlina so you probably won’t have to put up with all the annoying “INV 2 ASMON LAYER” people
---
Wow. You're right. I was more excited about a +1 Stam axe with than the 415 weapon I got on BFA the other day.
---
With sharding it's hard to tell a difference but there's probably less shards than there used to be.
---
You mean as a restro druid right? Because any other spec for druid is trash and all raid sets are made for restro druids.
---
That’s fine the majority of the servers are overflowing and the top server have 4-9 hour queues to get into game.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Go in blind like all of us did 15 years ago. Figuring out the game blind is 1/2 the fun!
---
That decides the players. The entire thing that made classic was the people you got to know. I would rather them use chromie in a unique way to give us stuff but for now there is lore than enough content for well over a year. Let’s see how people feel after that before finding new things we want.
---
That's what i though. But didn't happen when I got the kolkar booty key. Maybe it's just this key. But I seem to remember that those also ended up in the keyringslot.
---
that's also what killed wildstar
---
Cool. Welcome to 15 years ago.
---
Burn the mac.
---
We live in a society
---
Dang it's "not hotdog"-ing. It can definitely do to be more robust since I am the only person that has used it. If you are wanting to get it working feel free to make an issue on GitHub with the your printscreen ( do not crop it, multiple monitor could be involved) and settings if you used any
---
I don’t think classic will die. Ever. I’ve been playing osrs since launch and I fully believe in old school projects, **BUT** shouldn’t we wait at least a few weeks so these memes have a little bit more weight? We will probably still be posting them too then, but...opportunity cost or whatever.
---
**BOTTOM TEXT**
---
I don’t think anything is definite. My boyfriend was disconnected closed the game and was put right back in game night 1 a few times. It’s possible there was something put in place that failed and was improved or fixed during maintenance.
---
I just think people dont go to the cities yet, i was there just to get my professions and saw maybe 10 people doing the same.  Give it a few days and people will start afking in the bigger cities
---
They kick you out and make you change your name. It doesn't let you pick the same one. 
---
However if its really terrible may a ban. Also repeated offenses.

first world problem tears. delicious.

Ya, none of those sounds all that bad.  Just merging servers seems like no big deal aside from folks having to change names
---
Please watch a newcomers guids on youtube
---
Maybe it’s your mouse?
---
Nope.
---
Are they really so rare? I had 2 6 slot leaving the starting zone and another plus an 8 slot by level 10
---
Had they given notice about it ahead of time, since they *did* know more or less how bad the queues would be on high pop realms ahead of time, they could have made it easy for entire guilds to premake characters on a given realm to avoid the lock, and then therefore also have a feasible way to play with each other on launch, vastly improving the situation for guilds and friend groups.
---
No it’s not
---
Barrens chat feels good man
---
I'd consider a threat meter so you can learn about threat in dungeons as you level
---
"clocks are kind of squishy" lol
---
Dumbed down in everyway... lol
---
Why not play on a different server? Are they all full again?
---
Try /nrun
---
its days:hours:minutes
---
There were plenty of trolls when I played on launch.  It’s not like someone ninja-ing a node or need rolling gear they couldn’t equip was never a thing dude.  It’s honestly been way better than I thought it was gonna be.  I think you just need to wait till everyone spreads out a bit and zones aren’t so crowded

I played a mage in vanilla. I want to do something different this time, but I'm still tempted to play mage again. I think I'm going warlock.
---
The mage has great mobility. It is also a great class for people that like to help others. Other people always want ports, food/water, or buffs.
---
Can confirm
---
You missed the "For those of you who have multiple monitors:"

Just normal print screen would put all your screens in the clipboard

Golemagg eu has the same savageness in the Barrens going on. I still feel bad for steelsnout.

Dude - what your are doing is the definition of white-knighting. You are finding excuses for multi-million dollar corporation to not provide service they took money for, despite this being neither their first launch of mmo, nor do they lack resources. Pathetic.

Agreed. When you come home you should immediately log in and get in line and then go do whatever for a few hours

I thought YTMND died for real earlier this year.

I quit wow after cata.

I have not had this much fun in ages. Definitely here to stay.

Now I'm on a server named after the thing. Its a Thunderfury party in teldrassil.
---
Jesus Christ, we are the monsters.

It shouldnt bug if it does submit a ticket and they should fix it for you.

This is all well above my technical understanding tbh. But I don't quite understand how that comparison works. Like I know what you're saying. But the fact that this is all a virtual world makes it seem idk, more difficult to comprehend.

people are idiots and want to pretend they care or were around then. its dm though.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/66114-deadmines-dm-or-vc/#post0
---
Potentially people disconnecting and reconnecting fast enough for the grace period to allow them back in. The queue may see someone leave and drop down only to realize someone just got back in.
---
Not positive but this may be the case.
---
&gt; Mechanically, I'd argue it's about the same relative to the average player skill in each era
---
That's such a stupid argument. Going by this the simple mechanics in MC could basically be the same difficulty as modern retail mechanics even the top guilds struggle with for a week on progress and sometimes even later on farm. 
---
Strategically they **are** far above Vanilla. Have you seen how far Scripe (Method Raid Lead) and the officers go in order to have optimal set ups and strategies over to the custom weak auras for the next raid day? Heck, during BoD progress (the raid released earlier this year) they did the math in order to find out how to maximize professions and gold so much to gain the edge over other top guilds in order to win. 
---
The only regards Vanilla raids win in are the logistics of having 39 other people behave like proper human beings for a few hours each weak and managing getting the world buffs for everyone.
---
Some add ons are deactivated due to being out of date, did you go into the add on list of force them to be in use?
---
Faerlina is one of the ‘chosen’ ones picked by streamers so it will be super busy for a while
---
Having a different opinion isn't the same as being toxic.
---
they could legitimately think that, and they would be wrong.  the initial launch experience is so bad because people are quitting because they cant even play the game they paid for, and theres no end in sight for them even fixing it.  they are creating an exceptionally higher animosity for the company than theoretical "dead realms" that wouldn't exist for another year and that they can fix easily.
---
Dude in 2004 Blizz gave tons of statement credits to people for downtime during the first few months of launch, and then when things started overpopulating they would credit whole realms for individual downtime.
---
My transaction history is chock full of these little $1-3 credits 15 years ago.
---
Just combine name pools for a few servers. It's not rocket science.
---
Pressing single button?! Too much work.
---
It was also damn near one of a kind at yen time it had competition with what, Everquest and Guild Wars? I want whatever you’re smoking if you think there’s going to be even two million people playing this game in Dec.
---
Most RP in RP servers happens out in the world via /say. I’ve had some fun RP interactions so far being a human running around Teldrassil.
---
Should be closer to 10k than 20k, there are definitely 2x more people in queue than in game on some realms
---
I wouldnt mind an spriest but i dont wanna be asked to heal and if i recall spriests are terribly undesired in raids.
---
Oh I agree. But will blizzard do anything about it? We will see I guess. It’s definitely not right
---
Was this Incendius server lol? Please tell me no other server is arguing this long about it.
---
Poggers
---
No
---
With entitlement, see retail lol.

---
Leveling? Nah here's 60 bucks.

Gearing? Nah here's some money for gold &amp; carries.

I just call diremaul vc.

Yea maybe it's refund time at this point. Be back later type of thing.
---
Blizzard, much like From Software, have an awesome knack for revealing locations really well. Walking around the corner and seeing the impressive wall of Org, or this view, it's breathtaking.
---
Yeah but how long is this surge going to last?

I don't doubt most people will get tired of it and go back to retail.

there hasn't been any queue on EU past 4 hours since 3AM restart. All high pop servers show up as medium now aswell.
---
I got 2 bags on my first 5 kills in the game. Pretty dope

The problem is now every server is full
---
#YOU THINK  YOU DO

I didnt think about that, i thought about it for summoning for dungeons but that is a much smaller part of helping than mages, good point thanks
---
Good point
---
Don’t attack mobs 2 levels higher than yourself, every warrior should know that.. Especially at those levels.
---
Stop embarrassing yourself, your French is awful.
---
You can do most things in the main cities. Professions, training new weapon skills, class trainer, etc. You can talk to the guards to get mini map directions to trainers and such. Hope that helps.

Here's somebody calling it VC before Dire Maul even released. Why can people not accept that it was entirely server dependent and nobody is right or wrong?
---
funding secured.
---
Once, I dodged stalagg so avoid queues but it's not as fun without my friends to I've come back despite the queues, it will die down eventually and missing out on one day isn't the end of the world. It's easier to level without a thousand people in each zone too
---
So does that mean tokens are going up in price?
---
I really, really wish they had listened and added a second Oceania server before launch. Everyone told them to. Arugal has an 8000 person queue while the other 3 are on low population, because everyone (including me) is hit by sunk cost fallacy. Why would I go to the low pop realm that opened 2 days after launch when my level 20 is on Arugal? Dropped the ball, Blizz, because you perceive us as some dinky empty little island region.
---
Also people like me wanting all the rep from a different city faction to get that sweet non-horse mount.
---
Grobbulus has an alliance hunter that was 34 last I saw.
---
Live to win!
---
Ouch that's rough
---
Haha! Ill let it go when he admits he was wrong straight up.
---
Someone doesn't know how to upload screenshots
---
True. Difficult thing to balance
---
Incendius?
---
Only 16 levels until theyre all good!
---
This. The only reason I power level or boost is because levelling in retail is currently a mind numbing endeavor that I barely pay attention to.
---
Just finished a 6 hour session to level 10 in classic, and it was tougher, more satisfying, and more engaging than anything I've done for levelling in wow in years.
---
Fighter of the night man...
---
Agreed
---
These queues are for the long term health of the game. Bunch of salty nuggets. If you had your way every server would be without queues and in 3-6months (being generous)when the looky loos move on the servers will be decimated.
---
Why is Arugal still having queues over 6000 😴
---
No, you blind other players.
---
Yes, one thing that confuses me is what I should train, like is there a certain training pattern or what?
---
It doesn’t take a genius to spot the blatant racism in the makeup of the horde and alliance races and where they’re located
---
This is MUCH MUCH rarer than servers calling it DM
---
No it's your fault for breaking the rules for your own greed. 
---
Blizzard makes shitty server policies, yes, but it's still you, who keeps other locked out
---
I am having way too easy of a time too. I am able to bleed wnemies I could not bleed before and take no damage from mobs 3 levels higher than me. I really hope this gets changed because i enjoy leveling my wareior with effort but now I can aggro three enemies and not even care.
---
I've watched the queue jump by 1500 - 2000 multiple times tonight.
---
Autohotkey was used to stay in AV in the old days and led to ban waves all around. It’s a 3rd party program that clicks buttons for you, so bannable
---
Cool thanks for the answer.
---
Ah that might be it thanks
---
Similarly, I just want enough time to get through sunwell if there'll be TBC progression. It's harder than Naxx, every boss is like an end boss. It requires meticulous coordination. One or two people could die, but anyone makes a simple mistake would certainly cause wipe.
---
I really didn't think I'd enjoy classic but here I am
---
2meirl4meirl
---
It was still full yesterday, it only showed medium because it was half the size of the biggest server. They fixed it today and they all show full now
---
It's one hundred percent. I was playing 59 twinks semi-recently with a fairly large group that all stated they are going to play 19 twinks. Not sure what realm they ended up on but the people are out there.
---
I think the highest lvl rn is 38 ~60% Even if there was enough people I doubt they'd get week 1 rag, the fastest guy can prob get crafting BIS while waiting for rest to catch up so that he has group for dungeons. They might get BIS dungeon clear before reset if they tryhard.
---
Like asking the waiter for them to make your food extra spicy then complaining that they made it too hot.
---
Shadowplay.  Google it.
---
I had this issue earlier but it was due to an addon (gatherer). Since you do not have it I guess I am no help lol.
---
Also it's a game you can actually watch on twitch while gaming if you have multiple monitors :)
---
Can confirm. I turned on battlefront 2 (the original) on my boot camp MacBook and the thing sounded like it was about to blast off into space
---
Join the Holy Knights baby!!
---
Lol the web source that also has people saying they got cruel barb from shredder....
---
The only reason it wouldn't be saved is if the reason you got dced was that the server crashed and it gets rolled back which is super unlikely but if it happened nothing you can do.  Nothing to do with any of that is saved client side.
---
Macs can run hot, and Windows software is really bad at heat management when running BootCamp. Best to just run the native client.
---
Not in classic. I think it's bear at 10 aqua 16 cat&amp;travel 20
---
so just add 300 layers and hope 299 layers worth of players eventually quit, is your plan?
---
At first I thought I was going insane or some kind of Mandela effect that was going on when I saw it being called VC, not once when I leveled in 2005 did I ever hear it call VC then all of a sudden it was being slung around like it was always called that. It will always be DM in my eyes. DireMaul Will always be DMe or DMw like always.
---
So how tanky has been the voidwalker so far? With the hunter it's pretty meh, the pet can tank 2 mobs but only if one die quickly, and I'm spec BM.
---
my backup servers are all full now RIP
---
Yeah that's the second day. We'll see how it looks in December
---
Strangely, a decent number of people I play retail WoW with have abandoned multiple characters already going to the newest opened realm just to play. I'm suspecting that they will probably quit within the month (like I expect a number of players may) but there are plenty of people (my friend group included) who invested the whole day yesterday and some time today who do not want to move at this point.
---
How do you remove the fucking test-bar?
---
To the top of cathedral next
---
Before I logged off an hour ago there was a Warlock on Whitemane level 30. I think his name was... Dive? Wind? Might be remembering a different really high level player.
---
No its more like you booked at a restaurant and they took your prebooking fee and said "Come down and eat" and then you get there and you have to wait 8 hours for food and there is no table or waiting room. You've also worked all day and probably need to go to bed in a couple hours so you have to go home, but you get no refund or compensation. Also on the way out a bunch of bootlickers who hang out at the restaurant call you names and say "fuck off you entitled prick".
---
No. Layering simply spreads a single realm into several smaller fragments of players.
---
There is no cross realm technology in Classic.
---
Maybe they're just roleplaying as toolbags.  Not every character can be good.
---
Last night my q was actually moving. Like I knew I had a 3 hour wait. Tonight my q has moved from 75 to 65min and 5k-3k. I don't understand. Last night was at 10k in line and was moving faster. Less people dc'ing maybe?
---
Yeah, on Zandalar tribe I saw plenty of VERY non RP names (Ballnuts, Bigboii and shit like that), along with BS on the /s, so I’m not very happy. At least we can report names, but on the other hand I know well some of these guys simply came here for the lower pop, so it’s not entirely their fault either ...
---
That last minute of that video may be one of the greatest gaming videos ever created. Truly amazing capture, OP.

People like you are the reason lootboxes and other exploitative shit exist. You pay for a service and don't receive it, and go shill for the company instead of holding them accountable.
---
I woke at 4am Australian time to play on my very full pvp server. I had to get off and when I got back on it was a 5 hour que. I made another toon on a different sever which is more low pop and I go there when I can’t get on the other one
---
Just got on was only able to play for an hour but I had to wait 8 hours just to enjoy that 1 hour of playtime
---
My brother and I went 25 hours straight from launch. Slept for 6 hours. Now sitting in a queue ready for another 24 hour session.
---
That can't be right
---
I'm getting excited over Grey's still... GREY ITEMS!!!
---
This. There was a lack of a lot of QoL in vanilla too and that lack of QoL forced people to be a community and work together (usually).  
---
Just look at how busy general chats are in classic vs any chat besides maybe trade chat in retail.
---
The game was as fun as YOU made it, not as fun as the devs dictated it should be. It didn't have a lot of hand holding so it was up to you to decide just how deep you wanted to learn the game. 
---
I just returned in 8.2 after 6 years away since MoP. I dinged 120 3 weeks ago and downed azshara the same night. I hit 402 ilvl the same day I hit 120. Ridiculous. 3 weeks later im 430.   
---
In vanilla you would be lucky to get 1 piece of upgrade in 3 weeks of raiding a lot of the time. And you DEFINITELY weren't going raiding the day you dinged  fresh 60. No chance in hell unless you were in a guild who had the raid on farm and wanted to carry you.  
---
Blizz stripped away everything that made Vanilla entertaining so pander to a wider audience of people that had no interest in the game.  
---
TBH Classic WoW to me is MUCH closer to like a DnD group where the fun is what you make of the game. This is also a good point because they have RP servers because in Vanilla the audience of people playing were a lot of the time the same people who would play in DnD groups, or MTG etc. "nerds" mostly.
---
It's a problem with business overall in the world today from video games to restaurants and from vehicles to kitchen ware. All these corporations exists to make more money than last year for the share holders (not a logical way to think but hey that's what our world is founded on) so the most efficient way to do that is through "diversification" (bastardization of a product for profit) to appeal to a wider audience of people that didn't give you their money before. Basically all any business or corporation wants now is to be in as many pockets as possible. It gives you more longevity. Having one deep pocket isn't as good as a million shallow pockets of the same value because on one hand if you lose 1 deep pocket your out a lot if you lose one shallow pocket you have 999 999 more to back it up. no prob.  
---
Look at places like Subway selling Pizzas or Tim Hortons selling Burgers. WTF. And the ones that always pay for it are the consumers who were loyal from the start, these corporations basically spit in your face and give you a big ol F-U. It's basically saying "thanks for making us as big as we are, now we are going to use the profit you gave us to sell out and make something you wont enjoy". Really, who wants to invest into anything for years jsut to have it flip around and become something you cant stand. no one, that's who. But that's literally what happens with more and more corporations every day. It's disgusting and the lack of ethics or morals tied to business is the #1 problem in the world right now, absolutely. Corporations are even calling Apple and Google out about their priorities now.
---
VC west &amp; VC east
---
How is that relevant? They're still calling the dungeon VC before DM released. This shit is exactly what I'm talking about. Some people grew up calling it VC before DM released and y'all still have to fucking argue about it and say "nuhuh I'm right, you're wrong. Even though I didnt play on your realm"

HUUUAH
---
Not sure man, might have to use the twitch installer
---
1: Only estimations until Blizz releases them.
---
2: Close completely and restart. Only option.
---
3: Yes, if you Alt-F4 the server thinks you have a disconnect and you have a short grace period to skip the queue. But it is REALLY short, 1min tops.
---
4: Is WoW using the correct GPU? Tell it to use the correct one explicitly, standard setting is "Auto". The setting is somewhere in the system settings.
---
5: I dont know.
---
6: Classic is based on a version of Legion, it is NOT fully vanilla. It will most likely stay.
---
7: Only if you have friends that are in other layers. Else, no.
---
8: Maybe. No info on that yet.
---
9: No. Riva Tuner settings are extended driver settings. They dont meddle with the game itself.
---
10: Saw it yesterday, still exists. Google for it, I am at work rn, sorry.
---
11: Play retail for that. None of those shenanigans in classic.
---
You better wake up at some weird hour like 5 A.M. and pray the queue is low enough to get in quicker than normal.
---
You're wife is either a fucking lunatic or this is bullshit.
---
get Chrome Remote Desktop, start queue a few hours before your leave work, then once youre in character select just log in and log out once every 25 minutes until you get home.

Just got hired as a CEO for Nature’s Focus and solved Global Warming. 
---
Took me 35 years to figure out, but I’m finally only 120 minutes away behind just 2 players.
---
Apparently Blizzard knows they are NOT logged off for two hours.
---
Perhaps I’ll solve our mission to Mars now...
---
I call bullshit. You have no way of knowing you were first, just assuming.
---
Even in a different era, barrens chat is still cancer. People see barrens as an excuse to talk nonsense. It has a reputation to up hold
---
Questing isnt supposed to be difficult in retail. It's for story and getting the character to max level. The point in retail is to get to endgame so you can raid.
---
And the tactics to do high keys in mythical and do them in the time frame is super difficult.
---
I would expect that it is more players, you had to go get a physical copy back in 2004 and they were sold out
---
Ohhh myyy
---
Or pay $75 to only level for 10 levels.
---
It may not necessarily be moving on but just playing, with the launch everyone wants to play currently while in the future people will spread their playing time.
---
Wastes a debuff slot, so no
---
That's when you start dating Rosey Palm and her five sisters. They'll do anything you want 'em too.
---
Hey!  The King is back!
---
It's entirely a result of which server you played on in vanilla. The amount of shit slinging over it is ridiculous to me.
---
Any swipes that say yes? Tinder was after my time
---
Good stuff my dude, keep them close.  I ended up getting my good friends to follow me as well.  The game will fade but the memories built together are what it’s about.
---
I'll have to check after I get through the queue, haven't looked at it on classic yet.
---
It was to help waiting for jobs to spawn and in game latency, not server sizes.
---
I played back then and everybody called it DM.
---
Case closed lol.
---
&gt; Servers with queues shouldn't even be visible of you don't already have a character on them. 
---
[there are no servers available]
---
Turns out 3 East Coast US PvP realms and, what, 2? English EU PvP servers was a fucking hilariously insufficient effort on the part of Blizzard.
---
Who could have ever foreseen that those realms would fill up? How can we ever blame the company in such a situation?
---
You're shilling, even if you dont know it.
---
This launch is indefensible. And you have people white knighting Blizzard.
---
I just don’t like how the player base is blaming their own. I got a sub early to get a name reservation. There were only 2 or 3 pvp pacific coast servers. Obviously I planned with other friends so we could play together. Now everybody is telling me to “deal with it” “you chose a popular server”. I didn’t have many choices. No, I can’t change servers. Introduction of servers way too late by blizz is there own failure. Most of us are suffering bc of it. It all just sucks.
---
There's few on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/unit-frames?filter-game-version=1738749986:67408&amp;filter-sort=4)
---
Yes hunter pets can tank.
---
Depends on which one. Deviate delight is medium still but grobbulus is full during peak times with 5 hour queues. Morning and early afternoon yes grobb is medium. But most realms are medium in the morning.
---
Post this another time in a few months when classic is still going amazingly strong
---
Like cry on forums?
---
retail
---
I also played back then and everybody called it VC.
---
It depends on the realm you played on. Case closed.
---
That's ultimately the flaw in an expansion over a completely new game.
---
Dr. Who I believe.
---
“Do you guys not have cell phones?”
---
that is fucking hilarious
---
You needed to read the quests its where the information was.
---
Now quest text is most mindless filler that exsists solely becasue quest text existed at some point. It serves no real purpose and a lot of it is lame as shit in retail now. Consider the resources they spend on it too that they could put somewhere else. But no, keep pushing a system that has no point beyond some flavor once in a while....  
---
The story is all told through dialogue and cut scenes now you wont miss anything skipping every quest text, so really what is the point?
---
LOL this was me
---
This isn't a money problem, making more servers or making servers larger would only serve to damage the community in the long run.
---
anyone using dominos can tell me how to switch inbetween the main bar to go from normal and stealth ?
---
Might the hunter, wisdom the pet.
---
ayeeee
---
You know what. I can actually see that happening.
---
Oh my god that was you? Thanks that fucking wendigo boss guy did my shit it until you arrived.
---
Well not really. Blizzard is expecting a high amount of people to leave after the hype dies off, and classic wow has very little growth potential, considering that the game has no real new content. Blizzard wants to add enough servers so the game can actually be played, but also not overdo it and end up having low pop servers after the player count goes down
---
Specifically at 16. Once you hit 17 it's back to shit.
---
Not that I’m not having fun with classic (which I am) but why didn’t you join a guild to play with if you were missing socialisation? Joined mine at the beginning of Legion and they’re good dudes.
---
I'm also on Krom. It seems like it's going to be a pretty solid server. Queue was maybe 10 minutes at 5pm EDT, and I think it was 90 minutes or so for a couple of my friends around 8pm EDT. In a couple weeks when things calm down it should be at a good population I hope.
---
Free one way migration
---
&gt;they feel stuck because they completed all of westfall and they're still only level 13 and don't know what to do
---
... I see posts like this and it makes me skeptical of how much experience you even have. Good luck completing all of westfall at level 13 lol.
---
Unfortunately i have work tommorow :( can get away with 1 sick day not 2
---
I usually throw a heal to save people who are about to wipe.... But after having two gnome mages twice steal a chest right in front of  me, I think I'm gonna let gnomes just die in the future.
---
Same as yesterday early morning in EU dude. I logged in at around 7-8 in the morning and got in instantly.
---
keep me updated if you find out, it looks really cool and id hate to have to take it off
---
i woulda threw up a thousand servers and said ima merge these bitches together as they get empty and gave a list of merge groups that would merge into eachother
---
I mean, he *did* personally announce classic WoW so there's at least some admission. He's taking the whole thing in stride, as far as I can tell
---
People screenshoted queues of +26k people. 10% of that would be 2.6k people trying to play + 10% of who knows how many layers we currently have, that is +3k people trying to play on the same server, which, as far as I remember, was the max
---
So they're actively driving people away with 3+ hour queues? bLiZzArD lOgIc
---
Oh thanks that makes sense!!
---
Oh its all good, i wasn't offended, i had a feeling it was something along those lines i just wasn't sure. ;-)
---
No harm no foul brother.
---
After all the people that cried for RPvP realms I’m really surprised that Deviate Delight isn’t close to full.
---
You mean besides imgur?
---
And now he's president
---
&gt;It’s just too hard for Blizzard to prove I think.
---
Naw, its just not worth it for blizzard to ban someone over autoclicking to stay logged in.
---
How do you get more loot?
---
I tried kui and IT didnt work
---
sooo how was it?
---
Blizzard admit it, you didn't expect this.
---
Oh cool mate, you know how to repeat a Buzzword. Good little parrot you are..
---
I’m using this technique called “not being irrational” you should try it some time.
---
So many quests today required camping a spawn area and not only hoping you’d get your shot off before the other 10 people there but also that you’d get your drops.
---
Streaming movies is in no way comparable to what the servers do in an MMO with literally thousands of people in the same zone.
---
*Clears throat*
---
Classic good. Retail bad. Vanilla was pure and perfect, with no blemishes. This is what we deserve, Blizzard refuses to allow us fun.
---
**I don't really think I need it but, /S.**
---
"HEMLA FROSTBREW, AT YER SERVICE!"
---
Dude, this might be the issue. I thought for sure gatherer disnt do anything directly to the map other than simply overlay nodes harvested. I turned it off and it's working. If I could kiss you, I would.
---
**Mage**
---
I think people should be careful playing the game based on how it's like to be in full Naxx gear. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt most people are going to get to that point and if you don't then hunters are fine.
---
They're also great in every aspect of the game outside of raid pve DPS, and since tranqshot is a requirement they still have 3 raid spots.
---
I mean, I get the anxiety, but just play what you want.
---
And here I am, sitting in a queue that is 8 hours long. When I'm in, I have to go to bed. Damn. Probably not going to play for a few weeks if this continues.
---
If you mean how far are the undead from the other races, they are very close. The Zeppelin to durotar is in the first zone, it will take only a few minutes to reach the orc and troll starting area.
---
Guys...just fucking move servers to a smaller one. It’s ALOT more beneficial for you and wow if all the servers are equally populated plus it’s cool to have a server full of the rejects, creates a more tight knit and respectful community. For example I was set on Arugal server but moved to Yojamba due to Arugals 14 hours que BUT when I asked for help in trade chat I got 27 messages LITERALLY 27 MESSAGES because the community isn’t as hardcore and toxic as the bigger servers
---
Of course there was a guy called Mindfock!
---
Only for 📱
---
on Noggerfogger tailors sold it for 4s. Pretty nice guys
---
Ahh ok! Well that will be helpful for tomorrow at least.
---
Not a lot of that going on for me, but I'm glad it's happening somewhere!
---
I had the same problem with the 3d Acceleration thing, try turning off your in game discord overlay thingy and then try. Worked for me.
---
Maybe you can help her understand that Kobolds are in fact data, stored in a database, used to render pixels on a computer screen, and not sentient life forms with families, or even digestive systems for that matter.
---
Also the game is called Warcraft.
---
Also we need help defeating invaders from the elemental plane, bugs, and mindless hordes of undead scourge, so if she could heckin’ shut up and get killing, that’d be great.
---
I feel sorry for horde players on Ashbringer.
---
You guys are incredible lol
---
What is this screen saver you speak of?
---
Literally they all full.
---
Free realm transfers are completely harmless (with the exception to their bottom line...) Rerolling 10 times to new servers because theres 5hr queues, is not.
---
Well, past about age 24 your brain cells start to die so there's that.
---
lol Always has been legal, always will be legal.  Quit whining about someone who most likely affect you in no way.  Make friends.  Boxxers are a blast.  I boxxed from Vanilla thru Cata, and will be on classic this weekend.  There were 4 of us on my server.  We were universally loved.  Short 5 people for a raid, yeah one of us can do that for ya.  Need a quick dungeon run but no one on, yeah I can do that for ya too.  Getting picked on in a PVP area, yeah try that with 5 of me.
---
I played 14 hours in Elwynn and have yet to see rain. I'm on Classic graphic settings but set my WeatherDensity to 3 when I logged in for the first time.
---
some BFA cry baby wrote the article
---
Me too
---
Unless I get in before mid night.
---
Then I'm calling in sick.
---
I'm honestly at a crossroads. I won't be able to play AT ALL if the queues stay like this due to my work schedule. I get home around 7pm to see a 400minute queue. I literally have to go to bed by the time I get close to joining the game.
---
I understand autoclickers make this queue go slower, but I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. 
---
Are you guys against people using remote desktop from work to start on a queue early as well? What's the difference if you're away from your pc?
---
That statement by blizzard doesn't make sense. All players were new players at one point, and if "most new players don't make it past lv 20" and there are millions of people at max level, then the millions at max are actually a very small portion of the tens of millions that quit before level 20?  
---
Unless its a study from a later xpac, which would mean it wasn't grindy at all anyways because Vanilla was the grindiest, TBC was so so and really not that bad, then wotlk got too easy not enough grind and so on.  
---
So where in WoW's timeline would it make sense that "most new players quit before 20" "due to the grind" ?
---
Come on now. It was BS from the start made up statistic out of thin air.
---
You are and your dude.
---
As far as I'm aware, that isn't the case, probably just a funny little coincidence lol :)
---
anyone actually met a chick who told you WoW is for nerds?
---
my buddy in high school used to play WoW and he was so charismatic that he'd practically use it as a pickup line...like he'd make some reference to the game as a chick walked by, to make us all laugh, and she'd smile &amp; be confused, then he'd start talking to her. 
---
then he'd bring her around parties and just use WoW-lingo to the point that she'd say it herself and not even know what it meant. 
---
i'm on a tangent reminiscing lol but really , i dont ever remember girls giving me shit for being a nerd
---
I know, I know, it's pretty hard to believe, especially when you take in to account the fact that I'm posting on the wow classic forums. But I assure you, I did actually get married.
---
You also nee 10 times as much gold, so it evens out :D
---
consider yourself one of the very lucky then
---
Come to Blaumeux, I had no queue to get in today.  Blizzard told y'all to move off the extremely high population servers.
---
I understand a bit better now, thank you!
---
Hi Myz friend!!
---
print screen
---
I think they meant restrict two servers to one name pool pre-merge.
---
Miniding for low levels, ding 30+
---
&gt;I jumped out of stalagg que to get in and watch hundreds of my Tauren bretheren taking the fields.
---
Yeah man. I got to level 10 on Stalagg then got thanos snapped and the queue was over 275 minutes long, so I said screw it and hopped on Kromkrush myself with my buddy. If you see HotRodney and SlimJym, give a wave before we slay you for the alliance muahaha!
---
Well it is a level 14 ability so don’t expect it till then
---
This was also the main reason for why nights are not dark anymore. They actually explained it some years back. During wrath and cata they did a lot of work to upgrading the shadows in the game to look more realistic, but that involved severely cranking up the internal light sources of most objects in order to get the shadows to look right. They sky itself isn't actually bright--it's just that every object is basically glowing like a light bulb.
---
You can still see how this works if you buy the inky black potion from the darkmoon vendor. It just tunes down much of that internal glow, but does create some graphical issues. Whenever I use my mage's frozen orb when I have the potion on the orb loses most of its glowing effects and looks really dull.
---
That druid one sums up every classic wow druid video XD
---
Why don't they just force the players on merged servers to choose surnames? Would it really be that hard to add an extra field to the character ID?
---
I don't know, if I'm 1700th in queue it's really going to depend on the family member
---
Is this actually a thing? This would save my bacon quite a lot
---
Its not.  If i had to take a pretty accurate guess, theres been a few hundred boxxers max over the life of wow.  COming from someone who boxxed most of wows life.
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
Agreed. Every single thing you do feels more rewarding than live wow. I missed this. Now if only I could get in.
---
Asked my friends which realms they'll be playing on. "Firemaw". Went and queued up. 27342 in queue.
---
Said my goodbyes. Would be quicker to make new friends.
---
So does having a friend.  Just pretend multiboxers are a group of mentally deficient friends who can barely control their chars.  Nothing op or unfair about it.
---
How is it not
---
Same. I’ll probably never install bfa again tbh. Just loving the talent trees. And the way gold is so hard to come by. I want to get to 60 on both a horde and alliance and see if I can buy all the mounts eventually. I have so many things I wanna do
---
If you cant kill a boxxxer in PVP you and your buddies are horribad.  Boxxers are the easiest to kill in pvp.  Coming from a boxxer.
---
Yea bruh i get my 5-yr old dinner and to bed and “crack out”,  no marathons like a single dude but me wife is fine with it as long as i can hit the early start
---
Did they miscalculate how popular vanilla would be? Yes. You’re basically saying they completely fucked up just because they wanted to ease into adding servers rather than starting with an absurd amount, while ignoring several things they did right. Even now, they can’t just add server after server aimlessly. They have to do it slowly as adding too many can and will end up back firing down the road. Not sure what you geniuses expected by picking one of the most popular servers.
---
This is like pop vs soda.
---
True, i really dont care about using an auto clicker :)
---
Nope, servers were clear from 7-10 eastern standard. If you weren’t on your shit after the reset at 10 EST, you were in a 3-4K queue, on Herod anyways.
---
[You made the right decision!](https://imgur.com/3KMR0pZ)
---
I'm a fan of Palmela Handerson myself but to each their own
---
Only 16 debuff slots are allowed for bosses in vanilla. Hemorrhage isn’t worth a spot and it will over take a useful debuff
---
Wait we have less time to play?  I thought our agreement was we have less time to sleep, and when we do sleep it is at work or during server downtime/queues?
---
Indeed. There is a very good reason they chose to call it WORLD of Warcraft.  
---
Someone made a good point the other day actually, stating that people complain about the story and how we do all the work and yet the NPC get all the credit and we are just go-fers basically.  
---
The point he made (which I agree with) is that the Main Character in World of Warcraft is the World itself... which is actually a very good point. We are just catalysts to move the story forward, and people seem to have lost the fact that it is indeed the WORLD of Warcraft. Devs included, apparently.
---
you think you do
---
I see a new realm again - Benediction, pvp east.
---
No lame is fining a group, then slogging though a 5 man for 5 hours while you all die.  I just go in and do it all myself in an hour.
---
Just to let you know Paladins are the best healers once they have crit gear. :X
---
Thank you. Yesterday I got lucky and only had a half hour queue some how. Not today, currently 7000 ahead of me :(
---
Never saw that once ever, I’ve seen people argue about it from time to time over the past years, but I’ve never once seen anyone actually get confused and add a level 15 player to their dire maul group cause they said lfg DM. Not once
---
This has been my favourite vid in weeks. Love the desk and crying is perfect
---
The amount of people I have had to save (Shaman) because they over pulled is hilarious. Thanks to the 3/20 people who have said thanks...
---
Your opinion doesnt matter though, and its YOUR OPINION.
---
Thank you yo all the kind Druids who have been throwing me (and othrrs)
---
I've had more fun in the 5 hours I played last night than the last several years of playing WoW.
---
Even before the restart it was pretty clear. Logged in 1 hour before the restart, no queues and most realms were low pop or medium.
---
Or until Blizz charges you $60 to make all your hard work obsolete in 10 quests flat.
---
Especially with high spell crit and downranking. Can basically dump Flash of Light indefinitely.
---
Which is why I'm dungeon spamming the second I turn lv 17.
---
&gt; You better ~~not~~ be neglecting a child to watch wow on their monitor 
---
...jkjk xD
---
Its $15.00 a month so it would be $30.00. Did your boyfriend really need to save up for $30.00?
---
If they were to credit your money back for time you were unable to play.......it would be a little more than $1.00 lol
---
This was to be expected.......
---
NA PVE both, but Old Blanchy has low queues or none all the time, and Atiesh isn't too bad with queues at peak times (and no queues other times).
---
Gamon's Left Ball is inferior to his Right Ball!
---
No we are all using isboxxer which simply passes keystrokes and is legal.  It can easily (way more expensive) be done with hardware.  Which is how we all did it before the software was deemed legal.
---
thank you very much. I can always count on you guys
---
I queued for 6h. Got in, made my character and dc'd before I got to login. Got thrown back into a 21k queue. Then said fuck it and went to a low pop realm
---
Can you not report?
---
Get on the same faction before you're too high a lvl, alliance and horde don't play together.
---
My friend got his wife to queue for Herod in the afternoon.  6 hours later he was still 9000 people deep into a queue.
---
You really think blizzard would devote HUMAN resources to witchhunt after each invidividual that has a long play time? Do you realize how astronomically outnumbered they are?
---
No pics but I got 4 before lvl 8, was very happy. Dun Morogh!
---
Is there also one in Orgrimmar?
---
A phone pic feels more 2004?  No it doesn't lol... most people I know didn't even have a phone and the ones that did took 7 pixel pictures.
---
Go with a blessing my child
---
Haha yep. I found myself running around elwynn without any use of the map, knowing pretty much where everything is. Didn't realise my memories from almost 15 years ago where that good.
---
Thanks. I try this out if it happens again.
---
Send us you btag so we can have you banned.  Is that what you are requesting?
---
question. what happens if you try entering it at any point in classic/Vanilla?
---
There has always been one, if you DC you get right back in if you relog asap.
---
But if server crashes and go up again fast you will be in queue.
---
Got back in immediately, so this may be true.
---
You're only enjoying the game because nostalgia.
---
(/s)
---
Been playing on Kromcrush, very reasonable wait times. Considering abandoning Stalagg for it.
---
Correct. 10th Doctor &amp; Rose. Season 2 Ep 14
---
Pretty cool
---
Wait 1 month from now, it will be the real test.
---
Was there an announcement
---
If you just need to go to the character selection screen, no. If you need to change servers/exiting the game, yes, you'll have to re queue
---
Boxxers have zero impact in all regards.  Just a bunch of whiners who cant take 15 years of blizzard posts on boxxing as in stone.
---
Ive started to check the hp of players fighting mobs. If they are low I help out with a few arrows. Help like that can save so many deaths plus the game feels so much less lonely.
---
Ever heard of "Don't Pre-order"? Generally, it is not a good idea to pay for a game before knowing what the game will be like. If you don't like the game company then don't give them money.
---
Just wait till honeymoon phase is over. You think you do, but you dont. WoW was good back when everything was new and fresh.
---
I have to wholeheartedly agree - day one of classic was amazing. 
---
So many people being kind and thoughtful. Buffing strangers, helping with kills, sharing and caring. 
---
This is the game I remember and the game I love. 
---
Let’s hope everyone remains in this positive state and we get a really good run. 
---
Queues are a pain, but that just means the world is brimming with players. I’d prefer to wait an hour to play in a full world rather than be straight on and more or less on my own. 
---
Day 1 - 3 red bulls for me.  
---
Day 2 - none - my body can’t handle that kind of abuse twice in a row :)
---
Good hunting.
---
Excatly, on na at least there are several servers with 0 login queues
---
Probably not hard technically, but people get really attached to their names. They logged in weeks before the game launched, so that they can reserve them. Changing their names because someone else had the said name is going to be unfair.
---
What if there is a streamer that really likes his name and you decided to fuck him over. Just go to the other server and make a character with the same name before the merge. Then he has to change his name.
---
After being in a for 5 hours on whitemane I finally signed in only to be disconnected 3 minutes alter and have a 9 hour q timer.
---
Imagine spending time on a video game instead of fucking bitches every day like PhireFoxRBLX
---
&gt;the barren chat is cancer though, all they do is talk about trump.
---
If you said this in 2004 it would still be accurate.
---
Currently planning my wedding. Saw the q in my friends server I'm joining. Laughed and closed it. Guess I'm not playing classic after all.
---
(Made an alt on another server with a buddy to level together... we will see how that goes.... you all know how that goes.)
---
the one ring to rule them all
---
Is this the 2007scape subreddit now? I love it
---
Sounds like a good idea but honestly, logging into retail is low on my priority list now, right under clipping my toenails.
---
So theres a queue to resub, to get in a login server queue, to get in the login queue, to get in queue for quest items?
---
Gf did the same for me, she plays as well though so she even started before I got.home with follow and using both characters ^^
---
Man classic is awesome.
---
Shadow Priest is how I feel playing my Priest
---
Thanks for sharing this homie
---
I was there... 3000 years ago.
---
Have you and the people you play with discussed switching servers? Or is that just not an option? I know that people will be really hesitant to switch, but there's no way I would put up with 4 hours queues each day. It's just unacceptable to me.
---
I did this in vanilla. Know others that did as well. No one ever got banned.
---
BUT IT DO
---
Only thing which remains the same is the environment. It's not wotlk unless HC Loken wipes the floor with your rag tag 180ilvl group.
---
Case in point: CoD 1 is still over 10$ on sale!
---
So you got to play 20 mins after the queue?
---
Well I'm single now so RIP that strategy
---
HUH
---
Both DM. Dire Maul has three instances which have to be mentioned, DM north/west/east.
---
Just because u also want a gf ;)
---
That's only in classic due to the extremely low server population combined with a million shards. On private servers, you would actually meet players of both factions all the time while leveling. Shocking, I know, but it's true.
---
I had some memory (I used to know nelf and human starting areas by heart), but each new place gave me more like a ... feeling of deja vu. Which was also very nice.
---
I got pretty lucky yesterday evening, just 120 minutes of queue.
---
Confirm. And i'm a rogue
---
Trueeee
---
Servers aren't "real" anymore. Back in Classic days they really were a handful of individual machines -- the Blackrock instance server, the Blackrock Kalimdor server, etc.  They were in a few different data centers/clusters that eventually became "battlegroups" because they were easy to network between.
---
The architecture these days makes the concept of a "server" kinda moot, except for community purposes (character names, guild names, AH, etc.). This is why you can join another player on any other server in seconds. It's not really any different than when the server handling your active character in the old days changed from Blackrock instance to Blackrock Kalimdor as you exited AQ. Now your character is being handed off from one server holding a shard to a different shard server.
---
The new Classic servers are using the same architecture as retail, so there's no "Herod" server. There are just servers hosting shards, now rebranded into "layers", which you cannot join via cross-realm groups.
---
Basically, what I'm getting at is, there's no physical layer limit aside from the amount of server space Blizzard has access to. The servers don't care if they're hosting Herod layer 50 or Thunderfury layer 1. 
---
The player count limit (and thus layer limit) is designed, because Blizzard want to balance the population between realms, and they don't want a literal million players rolling on one realm. It would be bad for gameplay in the long-term.
---
I apologize if I am ruining this experience for some people. First time playing- have no fucking clue what’s going on.
---
I tried 3 times to login:
---
Launch 00:01 36000 Q
---
same morning 07:45 24000 Q
---
evening after work 18:30 32000 Q
---
Due to sheer interest i let the Q run in the evening until 23:30, still was 1770 Q and estimated 45 minutes.
---
I mean i am not into powerleveling, but if i cannot play at all, fuckit. Joining the "xpac" a month later is like joining Formula 1 with an ebike. Actilizzard should have seen this coming during name reservation from active players... but what do i know.

Then definitely use remote programs to head start your que. Nothing wrong with that at all man. What class are you playing?
---
What's happening in that chat LoL
---
Please, anti-cheat guru, teach me ( and Blizzard ) how to detect when software sends a random key input at a random interval, and differentiate it from someone actually playing or just browsing the interface. It's really a shame you keep such knowledge to yourself, as it would solve a lot of botting/afk-scripting issues.
---
Yeah right. Like most people aren't using some sort of quest addon or know the quest areas by memory.
---
Holy shit, fuck me. This is one of the best analogies I've ever read in my life. Truly, the work of an artist.
---
Now promote me, bitch!
---
Maybe for the same reason  classic players where insulting and  belittling people that l enjoy retail ? There have been just as many threads of people being called   lazy babies and dumb for enjoying the current game .
---
If one of you knows what you're doing not to bad. You can just hop on a zeppelin, walk a bit and you will be next to each other.
---
However I recommend still doing the first starter quests in the immediate area
---
Skeram gang, unfortunately. Enjoy your travels in Azeroth!
---
On Herod, 25 people camping Kreenig. Someone says "gentlemen, gentlemen let's form an orderly line" and someone else immediately replies "eat shit."
---
Even being complete new to WoW you wouldnt be standing in the starting area on one of the first quests after 3 hours, especially with someone who can help you out.
---
The problem is that I may not know which alts I want to roll in the future.
---
Faerlina. Huge queues though.
---
1 balled bastard is still stuck in a queue.
---
Link to Zygor classic guide?
---
More like durator
---
Torches; I tried yesterday lol. Plenty of torches around but they are like tree’s - unmarked assetts.
---
But yesterday was launch day. I also had no queue and I hope they upped the cap! But people sleeping is just more likely.
---
It's because your Battle.net account can't be logged on to multiple WoW games at once. It's a limitation enforced in the servers.
---
This is absolutely amazing.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
The queues are longer than I have to play each night, so this is my life right now.
---
If (and its a big if) your server dies, blizzard will 100% offer a transfer. I guarentee it. It would be a PR nightmare to not do so.
---
They literally said if a server is over populated or under populated they would open up free transfer.
---
Ive been rereading my dnd sourcebooks while in queue. Given me a great refresher for when I dm my games.
---
Are you saying that you left the laptop logged into the game... and then logged in again on the desktop? Did that log your desktop in and kick the laptop out? 
---
Or did you do a quick switcheroo where you logged out on the laptop and quickly logged in on desktop?
---
Your fiancé or the game?
---
I was one of the boys
---
🦀NO AUTHENTICATOR DELAY🦀

People forget that there was a huge stat rework along the way. Before that, I.E, Classic through at least Wrath (I skipped Cata, and most of MoP), Your gear stats determined your ability power, not your talents. Hell, there was +Healing on gear for a while, as a way to buff heal-primary specs vs things like off healing-Ret paladins out HPSing Holy Priests.
---
No. But you can use the tokens to pay for your sub. Particularly appealing if your gold on retail doesn’t have any value to you anymore.
---
It would be unreasonable to scale the realms up even more when they have the stated commitment to no layering in phase 2. 
---
They don't want dead realms, but they don't want realms to be massively overpopulated in phase 2. Compute/network throughput is not the only consideration.
---
I had someone purposely break my polymorph because he was bitter I got a job first.
---
This kind of pettiness lends itself as proof to the Horde's superiority.
---
You think you want it, but you really don't.
---
I'm thinking of going with TukUI, it's easy to set up timer bars with that.
---
sometimes it dont be like it seems the way it is.. but it do
---
Because people don’t want to play on PvE servers?
---
Vanilla behaviour
---
Yeah like wtf
---
Yep. Retail is more of a third person action adventure game than it is an mmorpg.
---
Some reaction youtuber.
---
&gt;it's definitely objectively superior
---
Bro I get you're hyped but calm down lol.
---
*Cries deeply in Paladin*
---
There isn't an issue. There are plenty of realms without queues. You voluntarily sitting in a line because you desire to play on a particular realm with a particular name, and that is not worthy of any credits or refunds.
---
Yup, some light rp in party or say just to keep it in world goes a long way for some people.
---
Oh, sweet.
---
5 seconds later  
---
AHHH AWWW UHHH
---
Can’t wait till the hype dies down for some, classic is nothing like vanilla was right now, leveling is ridiculously easy with mobs respawning as fast as everyone can down them, everywhere I go is a literal shooting gallery I just stand in one spot and continually kill the same three or four mobs as they respawn seconds after the last ones.
---
Eastern Kingdoms? duh.
---
He's saying classic compared to retail raids are easier, not vanilla. Idk if that was clear.
---
 The raids in early vanilla if you remember were even literally impossible at one point due to bugs. There are plenty of videos on it. That fact scews the numbers to compare vanilla to retail. All we can do is compare retail to classic and by doing so we will see classic beaten fairly quickly since all the info on what people need to do to clear it is readily available.. also mods help.
---
When i say these things Vanilla means 15 years ago and and classic means vanilla remastered as classic today
---
&gt;Edit: I also just skipped a couple of the more frustrating to do quests. It's not hard to level up skipping some quests.
---
This. I levelled with a buddy I found in the Orc/Troll starting zone, and we routinely skipped the "Kill named mob"-quests. The xp is a pittance, and the gear will be outlevelled pretty quickly.
---
Because it's 1.12 emulated on Legion client.
---
I fucking love that people are sitting in queue forever and then standing in queues in the fucking game.
---
Exaclty man. How is the Classic Weather ? I hope it is as we all remember from god old days ?     I am looking forward to play  in Mulgore again and experience that fog + rain. It was great. 
---
So the old weather is back in Classic ? asking bcs I am waiting for a week till the servers stabilise.
---
I have the low tech version of this. Wife is getting a call about 2 hours before I leave work and I explain how to log in so maybe it will be available after I get the kids in bed.
---
I've been checking queue times across the day to see how popular these servers are and stalagg seems to be pretty low, almost always lower than skeram. 
---
Whiteman and Faerlina always had queues almost twice as long as Herod.
---
“But there will be “dead servers” if they make too many!”
---
So merge them.
---
Why is this an excuse for half the player base to not be able to play? 
---
It’s not.
---
I just don't want to re-experience the bad design decisions going forward from vanilla. I think vanilla had the best class design (not class balance, obviously), and I'd rather see things move forward with the original philosophy.
---
There was a 33 Hunter who logged out when the lock was 30.
---
THERE IS A BUTTON ON YOUR KEYBOARD THAT IS LITERALLY DESIGNED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR SCREEN AND YOU STILL TOOK THE TIME TO FIND YOUR PHONE, UNLOCK IT, OPEN UP THE CAMERA APP, TAKE THE FUCKING PICTURE, UPLOAD IT TO WHATEVER-FUCK WEBSITE YOU USE FOR IMAGE HOSTING. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN LEVEL 5 ALREADY IF YOU HAD JUST HIT THE PRINT SCREEN BUTTON ON YOUR KEYBOARD.
---
Yo dawg
---
Rattlegore. It’s middle ground like you said and it has a higher chance of staying middle ground than smolderweb. Fairbanks will go down to around middle as well just no point in wasting times in queue. Rattlegore does get full and have queues during the evening though.
---
He was talking about while leveling. Which they cannot.
---
Zalazane, ugh
---
The undead starting zone was nearly unplayable for a few hours after launch due to so many people. It was a zombie apocalypse
---
I think you are missing the point as to what multi-boxers actually do. They go after economic objectives. Something that's gets boring for 20 people playing together and slows down progress and all gains have to be spread evenly across all twenty players. 
---
Multi-boxers bringsthe power of the 20 dumb players who are doing a dumb task without 20 players getting bored and all gains are given to a single person.
---
I agree
---
Too soon to say imho. I actually don't know if I enjoy it like I used to because at the moment my only experience with it are queues and camping of single quest spawns in the starter area. 
---
I hope that most players enjoy it.
---
Just to add to this, they've said that layering is mainly just for a smoother launch. They guaranteed it will be out for good by phase 2, ideally before then.
---
I'm with you, but we all know that if an addon like that gets made we won't be able to stop it right?
---
Wow turned into what it is because we wanted tools to make things easier and they just didn't stop. Everyone is enjoying classic for what it is right now, but in a month or two, there will be an addon for almost everything.
---
&gt; We have obligations and we aren't obligated to wait in a line to play a game.
---
Then why don't you go ahead and fuck off?
---
What an entitled masturbatory post. What exactly are you proposing they do here, or should have done? 
---
Open 50 servers per region so that people like you can log on and do some fishing for the first few days, the fuck off back to retail / hearthstone or some shit? No thanks. If you want to play during peak times, call in sick and get your ass into queue at 4 am.
---
I keep seeing people say it will “smooth out”
---
If they don’t add servers,  by definition people have to stop playing for it to smooth out correct?
---
That means that for tens of thousands of people - the entirety of their “classic wow” experience will have been
---
1) try to sign in 
---
2) see 2 hour queue 
---
3) stop trying to play because they only have an hour and a half of playtime
---
Rinse and repeat until they literally stop trying. Once enough people literally stop trying to enjoy classic wow (without ever having really enjoyed it), the wait times will stabilize and it will be playable for those who stuck it out. 
---
Is that *really* the best solution here? Thousands to hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to come back to classic wow give up on trying and that’s what makes the game playable?
---
I mean fuck, who cares if you merge 10 dead servers 2 years down the line, compared to this?
---
Maybe we’ll actually be able to log in now.
---
its kind of like a "HAHA SAM YOU HAVE ARTWORK TO FIX" to my understanding
---
Hahaha "too old for queue" get over yourself.
---
If you don't have time to wait in a queue, just wait a couple of weeks until server population(or even more servers open up).
---
You are not obliged to play the game..
---
That guy's got 5 bags and a staff at lvl 6 while I'm lvl 10 with my all-slots-full traveller's backpack and can't make any money because I can't pick up dropped items as my bag is full of shitty letters like "Thank you Mr. Soldier for the help, give the owner of this letter 5 pieces of bread in reward", damn.

Blue text on the forums:
---
"With a hotfix to WoW Classic a few moments ago, we’ve changed how the realm population labels work in order to display realm populations in a more meaningful way.
---
How it worked before this hotfix
---
As we explained here 233, the system previously calculated the population labels by comparing all realms to the most-populated realm. This could result in a very crowded realm (with a lengthy queue) showing up as “Medium”, since it was being compared to the realm that had the highest population and a potentially massive queue.
---
How population labels work now
---
This system now measures each realm against a realm’s absolute capacity. Medium indicates a healthy total population on a realm – well in excess of what we considered Full in a 2006 – with room for more players to log-in. You’ll now see a High label if the realm is close to having a queue, and a Full label if the realm currently has a queue.
---
We will continue to monitor this system closely and take further steps if necessary.
---
Thank you very much!"
---
There isn't an issue. There are plenty of realms without queues. You voluntarily sitting in a line because you desire to play on a particular realm with a particular name is not worthy of credits or refunds. You just chose poorly.
---
Pick another realm. If you can't because of friends or guild, then the wait is their fault not Blizz'.
---
bro this reads like an advertisement lmaooo
---
You are a no lifer, not a slow lvler.
---
No. Lets say it takes you 20h or herbing to get gold for a token. With 20 characters it just takes the same 20h but for 20 tokens because the nodes dont despawn. The only difference is that if you farm lets say 100k on top of that for yourself, someone with 20 characters farms 2M in the same time

The first time I played WoW was as an elf; Hunter. I remember that area with all the trees (name eludes me atm). It was dark and purple raining cherry blossoms. Plus the "atmosphere" of that whole elf area. It was quite magical. 
---
Then there was the guy who got his dick sucked for a winged mount. That was the tipping point, and it all went downhill from there....
---
So that's what they meant!
---
Bad for azeroth can go rot.
---
Can't find that setting.
---
I didn't say ad realms. I meant add hardware. Clam down.
---
I think it's fun, too. I dual box without any special software, just alt+tab, and it can be zany crazy fun, especially for low level characters.
---
Anyone who has levelled a vanilla paladin can talk about how dreadfully boring it is to autoattack and wait 30 seconds between button presses. Dual boxing gives you a lot more buttons to press - too many buttons - but I'm not sure I could level a paladin without it.
---
First and foremost, if your computer is still freezing when it's idle you haven't tried everything. Second of all, if you have any sort of sleep mode / hard disk power down, disable that. Third, look into Wake on LAN as an option for remote booting your computer from off.
---
Noob here. What does one do while waiting in queue?
---
Close the game via Alt+F4, that way when you relaunch you’ll skip the queue.
---
locks are squishy? you must be playing different classic
---
It'd be funny if after all the years of people calling new games WoW killers, WoW classic ended up being the actual WoW killer.
---
Surely better servers would allow more layers to be added for each realm?
---
Gosh, tell me about it.
---
I personally believe it’s going to most definitely be a thing for transfers from highly concentrated servers to lower ones. They want to be down to about one layers worth of people per server by phase 2, if I remember it correctly. Free transfers will definitely help to make that happen.
---
I finish my 12 hour night shift in 2 hours, so I'll be home in 3. Are the queues for Zandalar Tribe still bad or should I get some sleep first?
---
It’s absolutely fine in everything else aside from raids. You’ll find however most raids will not want you to rebuff the target, as other classes have better ones to apply than yours and you might knock a critical one off the target as there can only be a max of 16 on the target at any time.

I know this meme shit post will not die for. While, but I want to just remind everybody that warlords of draenor had the same awful launch queue times.

I love classic, but showing a launch day influx of tourists doesn’t mean anything.

Depends though. If I'm healer and we dont have mage water, then my next heal will only come once my pool is full again.

You have 100% no idea what you are talking about.

Yep, I left work early and queued up at 3:30, six hours later I still wasn't in game. Already asked for a refund and uninstalled
---
Yeah OCE got fucked especially hard. Only one PvP server until over 3 hours after launch, despite name registrations alone making the server hit medium pop. Now they have THREE, but at this point of course nobody wants to reroll, because a lot of people were able to get in and sink some serious time on launch. Got home to an 8k queue tonight.
---
There’s also a message that says: Disconnected from Blizzard services. 
---
This one appears to mean that battlenet connectivity such as real name chat isn’t working. I shit a brick last night after queuing for 3 hours and then getting that message :P
---
I entered the queue at 6pm CEST yesterday, I was still queueing at 12:45am.

After the need rage subsided I was actually impressed.

So many lives are being lost once again RIP.

And so begins claiming first to irrelevant crap. World first to tell you your server first is crap.

That's because knowing is half the battle-G.I.JOE!!!!

The sub drops because they designed it to be played as a single player game where you opt-in to multiplayer. A lot of people will just take the path of least resistance.
---
There were so many people who were upset that layering exists at all. And looking at how much trouble people are having trying to play with layering, imagine how much worse it would be without it.
---
Do you just leave your computer on for the whole day?  No going into sleep or anything?
---
&gt; the smart play IMO is the current idea knocking around.now to make overflow realms (Like Herod [2], Shaz [2]) and have them automatically merge when the population has dropped is a far superior idea.
---
Congratulations, you've reinvented layering, but without the ability to form groups between them.
---
Good leave. WoW will be better without Q\_Q people like you
---
Wasn't Maintenance at like 4:00 AM ?
---
I use chrome remote desktop to queue me up before I leave work, don't really see an issue with it. Can even do it from my phone.
---
I'm still manually doing it and there's no automation involved, so it doesn't break the ToS in any way.
---
Layers will go away and then everyone will be super invested in the server but queues will be massive
---
no I am actually new, no joke
---
wait so how do i play classic then?
---
Thanks, you too
---
What is upsetting is people acting entitled as fuck, or worse, surprised and shocked at having to sit in queue. Go ahead and be frustrated, but it's on you if you expected to actually play the first week, when you only come home and get queued right at peak times, during the launch period of one of the most hyped games of the decade. Blizzard did the right thing not opening an excessive amount of servers. Once all the tourists leave, Blizz gave themselves a chance at having a handful of healthy pop servers, instead of 50 dead ones
---
Old Blanchy is a great populated server for PvE players. Lots of horde, all really nice. Some idiots have no idea what they’re doing but let me tell you. No ques is pretty fantastic
---
My 12k queue yesterday was supposed to be 6.5 hours according to the initial estimate. I got into the game after 2.5 hours.
---
For this, I am
---
I get home around the same time and queues were non-existent last night on stalagg, one of the worst for prime time queues. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd reckon you should be safe at that hour
---
No server atm has a chance of dying (it’ll happen eventually of course). This shit is amazing....it’s insane IMO. Never had this much  fun in years just questing...leveling....progressing.
---
I'm off to the gym right after work. So I've set up Google Remoted Desktop, so I can start the queue ~4 hours before I get home. However, I woke up today to a very bad weather and a forecast of thunderstorms later on in the day, so I've had to swith it off. Well, I guess tomorrow is the day I'll finally play.
---
Yeah, similar to Oldschool Runescape, new content could be added on with kinda the "feel" and direction of Vanilla. Still requiring mp5, resist gear, etc, just adding new raids. OSRS even went as far as to make completely separate lore from the main game, extending quests (which each play a much bigger role in OSRS than an individual quest in WoW) past what they originally had, and making stories exclusive to OSRS. It works, very well, because it uses the same system and base from the original version of the game, just putting new stuff in as if it were a normal update back in 2007.  
---

You need to optimize! Get teamviewer (remote control) on your computer and phone, then start everything up in the morning. During the day just start the que through teamviewer! At least the que will be shorter when you get home.
---
Your solution is exactly what layering is lol. There is a cap on the number of people Blizz can have on a realm in order to merge down to one layer in phase 2. Making “overflow realms” aka more layers is just going to make it harder to merge down to 1 layer.
---
When I re-rolled to Blaumeux to queue times I asked, “is this server likely to die down the road”, and a dude in the Dun Morough general chat responded to me, “not if you don’t let it”. I liked that.
---
Layers are meant to be temporary and address the problem of too many people in the same zone, not the amount of people on the server.
---

I think it's because games as a whole are far more mainstream than they were 15+ years ago, people from all walks of life enjoy gaming so naturally companies try to cater to as many people as possible.
---
Because of this most games these days are very accessible and easy to get into regardless of how much time you have to play which makes it more appealing to a wider audience but in turn makes it less appealing to specific audiences that have more niche interests.
---
That's why WoW Retail is more like a phone game these days than an mmorpg, RPGs don't appeal to as many people as phone games do, Pokemon is following a similar trend with Go and Masters, but that's a topic for another subreddit.

It doesn't seem like it at this point. My group has switched to new servers 4 times now as they come up and within hours they seem to be full and have queues. If you're trying to get on during standard after work hours, you won't have much luck this week
---
Alright, I admit I've never heard that argument before. That's new to me.
---
What's the problem with people buying multiple seats on a plane?

---
I waited 2 hours before giving up at Launch and 2 more yesterday.
---
It's empty because when you have time to play almost everyone else here is working. Time zones are a thing.
---
My computer has been turned on for 99% of the last 10 years..
---
You dont downrank as a paladin
---
I got to play for 20mins in EU yesterday. Also its morning for EU now.
---
If servers are dead they'll merge. Also realm transfers were a thing in vanilla, so it'll be there. Top it off $15 per realm transfer of course blizzard wouldn't pass this deal, it's a business they want money, especially if they are teamed with activision.
---
[AHHHHHHHHHUGYNNN](https://youtu.be/fM-ty7mUvuY)
---
Really? I played retail for around 2 hours a week ago and I never saw anybody in the panda leveling zone and perhaps a handful of people in stormwind.
---
fun fact: you cannot do both at the same time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Mishearing 60 I think. Similar to mishearing locks at clocks.

How is it instant. It just puts it into memory. Then you gotta paste is somewhere, crop it, copy it again or save it. Not instant at all. Snipping shortens the process by several steps.
---
Holy pala is god*
---
 Very odd.
---
I have brought dishonor on the Alliance
---
He's the boss now. Still can't fucking comprehend that.
---
Um.. no it's really not the same at all. Honestly shocking how dumb some people are. Supposedly super classic fans, but didn't expect Blizz to have a conservative amount of servers to prevent ghost towns in 2 months. 
---
"Oh yeah, I can totally just come home at 7 pm on launch day and get through in a few minutes" LOL
---
People are waiting now, sure. But Blizzard gotta think about 8 months from now aswell, when those that are left only log in every third or fourth day. Do the servers still appear full then?
---
If they aren't they can start to merge servers, but then people lose their nicks and they destroy the existing server communities.
---
Or they can open free transfers, in which case they might lose the players that don't want to transfer.
---
Giraffe is absolutely right, just invite someone to quest or put something in the general. When start it, it just snowballs from there.
---
He just warned us about the queue times!
---
The feel of community is real, and was worth the wait.
---
What happened to eldar scrolls?
---
It won't.
---
This is probably like gyms in January, full to the gills for 2 weeks then back to just the dedicated few.
---
Indeed
---
Literally just merge them? They have the technology
---
If you say so dude, you sound like you're incredibly salty or bad.
---
Either way you're blocked so I stop getting a headache from your inbred comments
---
I'm interested.
---
Saw someone in trade chat saying "how come no one's using the AH?" Like dude what's anyone have to spend lol?
---
I'm currently 19 with 13 hours as an undead rogue.
---
Idk stalagg at peak times I'm seeing 20k+ even when i tried at 1:45 pm est time it was 10k that was before many got home from work.
---
GM island?
---
It is more difficult than retail, at least for leveling lol.  I have already died several times from accidentally pulling 2 mobs at the same time when I shouldn't have.
---
wow classic queue simulator.
---
you queue to login, just to find you have to queue to get into a server, just to queue to kill a quest mob.
---
Doesn't exactly work if you can't get into the server first
---
Yeah but this method of cheating makes blizzard profit so they allow it
---
I´m at work right now and tested the shotcut again on a fresh installed Windows 7 and I can take snippets with it... You don´t need to fix it but I think it´s pretty ignorant of you to just say it doesn´t work and not even look if it´s a function or not. Clearly you didn´t look through that enough becouse I can do it with every machine here lul... And wtf are you talking about OneNote is not a thing in prior windows [look here](https://softfamous.com/microsoft-onenote/) it litteraly says for Windows 10 7 Vista XP ... Clearly you just state things you don´t know... 
---
On the Site I provided someone fixed this function not working in windows 7 and you say it is no function at all xD nice one.
---
Choose another server if you want to play. Noone promised you to play on a specific server without having to wait.
---
To be fair, we are still in the think you do phase.
---
Give it a month and see how full things are, that's the proof.
---
I’ll take things that won’t happen for 500 Alex.

---
There's something about this scene that makes me lose my shit everytime. I think it's the crowd roar that does it.
---
Yeah I was shocked that my realm was on the "mega queues" list and had very minor queues yesterday and today. I play mostly overnight and 5am was a wasteland; no quest competition in the barrens. On day one. I expected more people to take some time off, even a day, if this was to be even as hyped as an expansion release.
---
Yeah I'm probably just gonna wait a week or two to let this shit storm calm down a bit. Also by then maybe I'll be able to pick a server that isn't like 90% horde if I wanna play alliance.
---
Blizzard is putting effort into making sure they can say I told you so in a month. Give them a break!
---
Under StormWind
---
I agree lol. I wanna poach while I'm waiting in queue. = (
---
An ingenious solution.
---
Do this post again in 3 months.
---
Software that replicated what used to be done with hardware. Back then you used a keyboard/mouse splitter that fed your strokes to 2 or however many computers you were using to multi-box. You also had to setup all keybindings one by one, macros, etc. But if you pressed any button, the splitter would then broadcast that to each computer.  
---
Software now takes the place of that since PCs can now easily run multiple instances of WoW.  
---
Blizzards big thing is 1 keypress = one action. If this is followed then multi boxing is allowed, even if broadcasted. That means you need human input for any action to take place.
---
Transfer where though? Every server is full.
---
Save that for the big gold when 19 twinks become viable! BiS 19 for rogues and hunters for sure, might even be more classes. But rogues and hunters kind of dominate the 19 bracket from what I remember! What a lucky drop! :D
---
It is? Well then I will prioritize random warriors I see on my travels
---
In\*
---
This is like finding out you can double click on a character to log in instead of selecting a character and clicking Enter World.
---
was druid drawn last i just see the frame of that one as punch line referring to the person at the computer that plays as a druid
---
They def should not have been able to roll on anything if you tagged it first. Shouldn't have happened. They likely got something that was intended for you. Chin up, wow classic was a pretty flawed game. It truly wasn't the best version of WOW, but it was still more fun than the current version.
---
Personally, and this is just my opinion here... but for me the best version of this game we're in the patches leading up to burning crusade and then finally the burning crusade expansion itself. Hell, I even enjoyed the other expansions until they added GROUP FINDER!! I think that killed wow, and the community. They should have just merged servers to keep the active servers all high to medium population and been done with it. 
---
Group finder and Instant transportation... The wow killers.
---
How cool would it be to see them re-release the entire game piece by piece again FOR FREE, only charging for character transfers from classic to burning crusade &amp; etc., but leaving group finder out completely. Keeping all the server sizes at high to medium so there's always a sense of community... yes please.
---
God no. Add more layers please. I have had 0 issues with them. I’ve continually ran into the same people from level 1 up to level 20. Lots of people that remember me and I remember them and we chat every time we bump into each other or even a friendly wave.
---
The sense of community is still there with layering, if more layering fixes queue issues please do it. This is coming from someone who hasn’t even sat in a queue yet.
---
As a paladin i try to do my part with blessings, sadly they only last 5 minutes
---
Weather making things difficult and inpacting your gameplay is a good thing though. It creates emergent gameplay and variety of experience. I'd love to have more things like this.
---
gl cooking 99
---
The number is different because servers hold a much higher population, but were people waiting 6 hours to log into illidan in 05? Yep, they sure were!
---
Are you new or something?  Lots of level 10 twinks.  They're harder to make too.  A full level 10 twink can beat a level 19 twink in a duel too... Their dodge is so high you can't hit them.  They're made primarily for dueling rather than BGs.
---

Each race gets it somewhere different.
---
I queued for 6 hours and know people behind me in the queue who waited 9 hours. Dunno what this guy is smokin
---
Daily reminder that this guy is hogging your spot in the queue.
---
Context,
---
I was one of few people who seemed to have an instant cast spell so I told everyone that I owned the house and that it was my "Love Shack" and "NO POLYAMORY ALLOWED" So I had them standing in a line behind me taking turns getting invited to my group to get the mob for their quests. 
---
For anyone who wanted to add a plus one they had to pay the fee of 1 Silver. Those were the rules of the "Love Shack"
---
Didn't old ironforge require an actual mechanical exploit? (That I don't even think is in classic now) For SW you just needed to do some precise jumping, it could theoretically happen to anyone who's just exploring. The only way I know to get into old IF was to run under the vault as a gnome and use the "Help I'm stuck" function to shift you through the wall and hope you don't land in lava.
---
It's more about how when any game releases, no matter what it is you get peak activity at launch and things die down pretty quickly after that. They're allowing for that affect by slowly adding servers rather than starting with, say double what they had.
---
The long queue times for the first 1-2 days are much more preferable than a sizable portion of the servers being dead 3-6 months from now.
---
&gt; feels underpopulated and it faces the risk of completely dying. 
---
You're more wrong than anyone can comprehend here. I started playing on the lowest population server yesterday morning as it was the only one I could log into without 3+ hour queues.
---
Trying to login now, 4 hour queue. Every server they release will fill within a few days, none will die.
---
Good guild name
---
Gotta remember, first couple weeks of launch will be unpredictable and not accurate to determine how busy and when a server is because some people are playing 12 hours straight and then sleeping and getting up and doing 12 hours again. Once the hype of the first month is over it will go back to a regular schedule of every server peaking 4-8pm with every other time being no queues and way less traffic.
---
Yeah Venoxis is full by now too...
---
I went from Venoxis to Patchwerk to Dragon's Call.
---
Dragon's Call seems perfect so far
---
Thx
---
5s and 93c, actually.   well, and quite a bit of travel time
---
Is there a way to view what time zones each servers are? I want to play Pacific coast time pvp
---
Finally someone who realizes this. I'm getting tired of people saying Classic will die in one month. I also hope retail players who say this realize most of their realms would be empty without cross realm sharding, meanwhile Classic needs layering to even make medium pop realms playable. It's going to be more than fine...
---
When they remove layering it's still going to be more still really active, more active than any private server has ever been.
---
When i first made the table I grabbed the top 5 streamers to populate it, that's why asmon/sodapopping are in the list

---
It’s the OSRS/RS3 relationship.  RS3 needs to live on as the as whale revenue generator and a shade of its former self so that we can all play OSRS.  
---
BFA isn’t as bad as RS3 but it very well may evolve this way.
---
Never even heard of these clowns.
---
‘Low’ servers had 1 hour queue Yesterday. My medium server took 2,5 halfs to get in. So that’s just not correct
---
Not really he could pick the same herb on retail 21 times...a stack of herbs for 1 node
---
I don't think that is absolutely terrible but there is an argument to be made that this is even more disruptive than trying to balance them now by losing players before the merger frustrated with the population, then uprooting everybody and introducing huge number of new people to two or more existing communities that the others don't know, etc. Blizzard has taken this argument. So a little more pain up front for much less pain down the road. 
---
Anyways queues don't seem to be so bad at this hour. Most of them are empty or low number in queue except the big three servers so I suspect they are getting close to equilibrium afrer maybe a few more servers and transfers potentially. I eventually settled on Sulfuras. It was one of the early additions post launch so likely to stick around more, it is full during prime time but my longest queue was like an hour or hour and a half and at midnight it was 10 minutes. Now it's open. Also it has a cool name. There are several servers that follow all those patterns as well and few, like 3-4 only, that don't even have queues during prime time. I'm willing to accept a small queue of an hour or so that I suspect will be gone soon though in exchange for a bigger potential long term player base.
---
They used to give single days of playtime but I think they stopped.
---
Also they see Classic as the free part of the subscription. You pay to Play retail and you are able to do that easily
---
not to mention that there aren't enough quests to reach 60(if i remember correctly) so doing every quest you can is tempting.
---
I had a childlike hope 😂
---
For some reason, since the server reset at 3 am (gmt +1) there has barely been any queue on EU servers. Firemaw used to have a 10 hour queue with 24k people. Now no queue at all. Wonder what happened. They might have upped the server capacities.
---
There are numerous min max mechanics that non hard players won't be privvy to without the time and research investment.
---
I'm not saying there aren't layers in between, but to think that queues are the reason casuals are behind and somehow that is why they quit is just naive.
---
Haven't had more than a 10 min queue on bloodsail (been logging in and out since launch), and I've yet to encounter anyone enforcing RP rules.
---
That having been said, it feels like there's zero sharding, Players are everywhere... I don't mind collecting 12 bear-asses, even with vanilla drop rates, but when every bear in the zone is camped, shit gets aggrivating. I mostly play in hour long bursts, covering maybe two to three quests at a time, but knock on wood, the queue times themselves have been sane.
---
So their shit isn't together because you have queue times?
---
Shit. This is better than DCing every time you get on. Hands down.
---
Plus, my servers queue times are only 30 mins max during PEAK hours... So.
---
Tried logging in yesterday but the many hour long queues unmotivated me, so in other words none. But I would like to be on a high/medium populated server
---
It would be cool if Blizz did something for a player jumping in Blackrock Mt with it on or destroying it there.
---
My husband and I dual-box together (two people, four computers). It's actually a lot of fun, and we have to work together a lot more closely than if we were playing normally.
---
Last night i helped a lone warrior to kill Oakescowl, healed his ass while he's fighting
---
Drink, smoke, gamble.

Toxic af
---
Just in a few zones too
---
OMG totally, and I was listening to that part when I read your comment haha.
---
Wasn't bad for me that time yesterday on Zandalar Tribe, took less than 10 minutes.
---
I dont think Minkelz, whom you replied to, talked about dungeons while levelling. He never specified that.
---
Labour Day is 1st of May by the way. At least the real one.
---
In Eu it’s 7:45am on a weekday that’s why. 
---
Yesterday around 5pm when everyone finishes work I got disconnected and sat in a queue for 5 hours
---
There will never be a better time
---
that poor bloke will still have to hear this at his deathbed.....
---
Why would you ever turn your computer off?
---
i wish every loser on earth was a company owner that gives jobs to 20 people, maybe someday
---
This will start to happen soon. But honestly currently at starting areas there is so much people that I just would need to spam buffs and drink between. So to everyone if you won't get buff I am sorry. I don't buff you because you are idiot or I don't want to. I am probably just oom.
---
That's weird because I've been able to get into many servers low, medium and some high without a que or maybe 5 min que. I logged into westfall tonight and status said "high" and I still got right in. Even logged out 3 hours later and relog still as "high" and I got right in.
---
The server kicks you after 30 minutes on char. screan. 
---
If you want to stay loged in without play you need to make a new char and delete it every 25 minutes. 
---
Best Regards,
---
Yes you will be disconnected 30 minutes on the login screen EVEN IF you take action. You need to login to a character to not be dced
---
This! Fun server so far! I created a guild and it’s been so much fun!
---
I'm not interested to be a think. 
---
But as a Night Elf Hunter, preservor of the World's Nature, I must warn you: beware of the Naga, fellow warlock, and beware of the dark void. 
---
You're facing Ashenvale's proximities: I would not hesitate to take measures to preserve the World's Balance, taking any necessary actions. 
---
You're welcome to our lands, foreigner, but preserve the Nature's balance you must.
---
Ishnu-alah, Adventurer.
---
they should let people play via layering while they figure out how to fix this mess for phase 2.  putting the solution on the players (spread out onto dead servers) is terrible
---
weird ive never seen a hunter pet like that before
---
I read this in Actilizzard voice
---
that would explain why i had queues (albeit shorter ones) even when logging in to a "low" server yesterday evening when i got time...
---
Still decided for one of the medium servers, but with your explanation it might not be as bad as back then. 
---
Still, i could see A LOT of people leaving very soon (maybe myself included). Chat already was full yesterday with demands for simple functions like map-indicators for quests etc...
---
I can only imagine it getting worse and worse when people realise that some travels will take 30minutes or that they have to GO TO the dungeon they wanne be at
---
I think this dude is trolling
---
No you're not ...
---
Yes. I know for a fact that it times out on char select screen. It's happened to me over the years. I think its 30min
---
&gt;  It takes a long time to get to 60
---
Not really, even with all the competition i hit lvl 12 in like 5 hours.
---
God thats amazing. Me and my friend used to do double rogue and go "Left" and "Right" for names. These would've been better for classic. Imagine being opened on from stealth by "Youthinkyoudo" and "Butyoudont" in Stranglethorn Vale, 100-0, dead.
---
I think that even if they lose 80% of their players, these unhealthily maxed out full servers will end up in a fairly decent population spot in the end.
---
Fuck man, got home from work to a 400 min queue time on the OCE PVP server. Gonna have to try remoting in from work and queuing up hours before I get home
---
they think they know
---
still has a queue during peak time, no thx.  people have rerolled enough, it isn't a viable solution
---
Just never leave. I only took Tuesday off and am level 22
---
Without other inputs this will still afk you

Maybe it was darker because of the old CRT monitor.
---
Too much confidence can be blinding and too little can be crippling.
---
I put mine on sleep.. I thought you were supposed to lol
---
Yeah it's worthwhile. If you are going to go to a new area and you can't gather or produce with the materials there then level up first. 
---
If you do your professions then you can have a mount at 40. If you ignore them then you'll be getting it at 60 like the rest of us idiots in vanilla.
---
Im at her and shes not giving me a quest
---
Jump ship lol
---
I put it on sleep mode, I thought you were supposed to
---
Much appreciated on the explanation boys.
---
Im so excited to play since this is my first time! But im getting pretty bad motion sickness when im turning. Anyone know which setting to turn down to help?
---
Nah. We have like 10-15 people playing on the same server, some already 15-20, switching isn't really an option at this point.
---
holy shit the amount of shit in this shitpost is overwhelming. am i swimming in shit? damn shit sucks, so much shit.
---
The first time a zone got dark I forgot how sick it was. 
---
Can’t wait for duskwood. (Unexpectedly got roped into alliance due to 2 friends playing when I didn’t know they would hah)
---
Does rdp work? Or will it kick when I switch to local logon once I'm home?

There's none

After five i went to bed. Havent been able to play one single second. Just Q

Currently joined in Stonespine after trying Shazzrah, Firemaw and Flamelash: the queues were horrible.

There really isn't any need to go prot for leveling, you should easily be able to tank 5 mans up into the late 50s. You just slow yourself down unnecessarily.
---
Do you turn using A and D?
---
Oh yes. i sometimes wait a bit until they are even lower so they get a bit panicked and then i full heal them +BoM :-)
---
queues on whitemane are insane.

Feeling the same as a mage: frostbolting the shit out of every chasing mob that almost kills a random player and slow them off to pick a life-saving kill.

Love it.

20min q on full?
---
I downloaded Google remote desktop on my pc and phone so I can join the queue on my way home!
---
Yeah, that was my plan yesterday, I was ready at 8 PM, then bam.. 6k queue, more than 2 hours to get in. By the time I got in I'd have to go to sleep... I guess if it goes on like this I won't be able to play at all this week...
---
Meanwhile people are selling linen bags for 25g on Classic AH.
---
“He just killed you”
---
They likely upped the server capacity and added more layers on top of that. Hope the servers can handle it
---
ME. Also buffing everyone I see.
---
That's when Blizzard introduces their new anti-cheat software. They call it a constant accurate terminator.
---
Not necessarily. I hope it brings down retail because it would force them to look at their design philosophy for the next expansion, possibly releasing legacy realms and more old school RPG like mechanics ect.
---
I haven't had this much fun in an MMO in years. I love it.
---
for most of us old veterans it is still new and fresh.  played gnome mage?   try tauren druid this time...   and another thing you naysayers don't seem to grasp is that it is the community that keeps us coming back.  Just this morning at lvl 8 I had to kill a Venture Co leader, in a cave that was packed full of bandits, too many to safely navigate through. at lvl 8 in white gear..  So  this random warrior shows up, we team up, we run through, we don't know where the quest mob is, we fool around, we pull to much, we almost die, but with some clever war stomping and healing we survive.  We find a very nice green axe, which he politely asks if he can need for, of course I can't even use it..   In the end we end up on each others friends list and will probably team up for future dungeons, I found a good tank and he found a good healer. These random encounters can turn into guilds...   
---
And if one of us acted like a jerk, that also would be remembered , it goes both ways.
---
Teamviewer, and you can start queing a few hours before you leave work
---
Not in the slightest
---
How feasible is raiding if you work nights?
---
no no no figgots, let ME tell you what you want, and how you feel. because i am a literal god, soon to be the president of Blizzard Entertainment. 
---
he does not like vanilla btw. no one likes him as well, except some very weird people.
---
Been in queue for 2 hours, down to 4.8k!
---
Big agree.
---
On EU Hydraxian is the only one without a queue.
---
Pretty sure it's global I've had to invite people to parties to see them.
---
Bahaha “better in groups”
---
You conveniently left off the part of that sentence that makes it true though. From an MMORPG standpoint, you can not argue that Classic isn't a better game than retail.
---
Nice!  Personally, I'm going for  **Azzere the Skyblade** ... only red wind serpent before ZG is released, and as a Horde zone spawn, should be hella rare to see an Alliance with it.
---
Same. No bags yet on my main. I'll probably reach 45 on tailoring and craft my own bags before I find one.
---
Meanwhile my Horde alt found two bags during the first two quests.
---
Haha yeah that and as I'm running I'll auto attack/earth shock a mob someones killing just to help em out a bit
---
Yeah, I've reported a few names. Asshat the gnome, I'm looking at you.
---
Dumb vanilla question. Is the AH linked here from launch? Or will that come eventually in classic?
---
Well the moving isn't solving anything because they're still super short on how many servers they need. On Fairbanks I saw a queue over 20k with the server already being full... I don't know how big the servers are but I imagine that's more than a server's worth of people in queue for ONE server. They need to double their servers and then some, seeing as medium pop still carries a queue to login.
---
also max taps on nodes are limited to 10
---
Yea.. they think they understand, but they can't. They think they know it all, but they don't. They, think they can handle it all, but they're not prepared. In the end, some of them will be getting gkicked, or removed from the 40 man raids they've never felt the wrath of before. The communication that will be required, will frustrate them. They will leave to play BFA and talk trash, about how stupid this experience for them.. but in the end, they'll always know.. that WoW from 2004 was the one of the most epic and challenging social gaming experiences ever created.

This is our time, old timers. Time to show them we were the more dedicated gaming generation. This, is our time.

---
I don't think there is any chance for transfers from the newer servers to one of the earlier servers, paid or no. I wouldn't expect paid transfers before populations stabilize in any case - maybe around phase 3, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
On the other hand, I'd say chances are good there will be free transfers from the original servers to the newer ones pretty soon, I could see 2-3 weeks from now. And some guilds might opt to take these, since raiding will be utterly impossible with 1h+ queues for many guilds.
---
If you farm enough to sustain one subscription and multiboxing increases your farm speed by at least the same factor as you increase chars it will always be a net gain without spending additional time.
---
I guess the US queues are more tolerable. EU had a general queue to the queue systems
---
Pretty sure that was removed, no?
---
He's gonna be my next grab, too! I can't wait, and good luck to you!
---
I was just on top of that mountain in the barrens for the quest where it turns red at the top and it was the dope as hell looking.
---
then everyone queues remotely 2 hours early and the queue magically gets shorter right?  lol
---
I forget the name of the setting, but for me the camera always auto centering behind my hero was giving me motion sickness. I turned that off now I'm fine.

uhhhh just get Steam Link on your android, and you can even sent inputs

I feel this big time. I was born in ‘96 and I played from right before BC until right after Cata. I just had some nice people run me through deadmines all the time and did my best to sell stuff through vendors. I’m having a blast playing the game understanding better what everyone else was playing bc I was barely playing
---
&gt;bring microtransactions and coinage to classic, or take down classic with it
---
Back to pservers it is then.
---
Tokens went up 40k in last week. EU.
---
They did announce the were doing this
---
Yes. Thats whats giving me the most problem I think. Im very new to the game so anything really helps.
---
Questie and Map add-ons can give you that functionality even in vanilla. Always used stuff like that. Also it should be noted that today they fixed the system of how they label servers. Now low pop servers are new servers, medium are healthy strong population about several times what full was in classic, high is close to queue and everything with a queue is labeled full now whether it's 1k people or 25k people. This was explained in a blue post earlier today. Almost every server except for the 3-4 newest were full though the queues ranged from a few hundred to 20k and all the newest servers were medium. Now that it's like 3am est alot of the full servers are reading medium and you can get on. I ended up on Sulfuras since it has a cool name and during prime time queues cap out at about 1-1.5 hours, like 10min at almost 1am and no queue now at 3am. The weekends are gonna be worse but if you are worried about future population while also not sitting in a huge queue find one that's similar to that. Medium (so healthy full) over late night and full but not completely overwhelmed during the day.
---
If anything, you're giving them a *more* authentic experience by being aggressively bad at the game.
---
Okay no need to flex
---
yes, because 45=0

I'm wanting to main a hunter. I started in TBC, how short is the variety of pets u can have? Will I be I  trouble for raiding spots? Can I be the PVP god? Thank u lmao

It's literally just a politer way to play WoW. Yesterday I asked in general where I could buy a fishing rod, because for some reason the fishing supplier didn't have one! A guy groups up with me and said I'll show you where to go, found me the trade goods guy and bought me the fishing rod! Only a few copper, but just such a nice gesture. 
---
(And yes, I could have found the answer on Google in a couple of moments, but it wasn't that easy when i played classic, so I'm trying to not cheat the game as much as I can!)
---
&gt;Buying early didnt help that much lol

It did help though. I subbed last week and had no problems

It takes a hour to earn a retail token (for all accounts) for boxers, and sometimes not even that.

As long as you have level 20+ characters, there’s multiple things you can do. But often times farming transmog is super low effort, takes a bit to sell, but is huge profit.  Or farm a rare drop from specific mobs for roughly the same method.
---
Herb/mining also works, but will make less per hour (and is capped at ten people per node)
---
Fishing works but is slower (and won’t make you that token in a hour) but works on a unlimited number of boxers.

It's somewhat cute because it's very obvious the person knows nothing about wow at all, but came up with everything from his/her own imagination.

I dont get why you shouldnt take invites. Its way easier with a group and funnier

I never said any of what you are bitching about, also yeah some people called it one way and other did a different. But the MAJORITY called it DM lol.

Try resseting the PRAM, hold alt+cmd+p+r while booting and hold in toll you hear the Starring Sound twice
---
Except the launch of a game has a severe impact on whether it does well or not, a complete inability to play the game can become the self-fulfilling prophecy to make it fail. No one is saying 'open 40 new servers' they are saying to make it reasonable, at the moment it literally is not reasonable to get into the game on most servers. And on the servers it is reasonable to get in on no one wants to go there because they've already got ties to the high pop realms. They can 100% afford to open a few more realms and offer the transfers.
---
They aren't long for a 'reason', they are a symptom of a problem that largely can be resolved. As Blizzard has already said a medium pop server is larger than even the fullest servers they had in Vanilla. They are in no danger in the **slightest** of having issues with long term survivability with the current number of servers when literally all of them are full and most of them have queues as big as the server populations themselves.
---
Lol we are talking seconds, you guys are money thirsty
---
Was able to test it myself yesterday, btw... and it works.
---
You can get exp from exploration
---
Got home from work 5.30pm gmt+1 in EU, hopped on the lowest realm pop, played for 6 hours.
---
If you really want to play on the currently full realms without queues, you'll have to wait until the zerg settles. Blizzard warned players that the pre-released realms would have queues and advocated for re-rolls. Let them release servers appropriate to demand and be patient, it's necessary to meet phase 2 numbers.
---
It's been 33 hours since release, chillaaaaax doomsday prophets.
---
They are not doing it for free ;)
---
Wait a week? I'm paying for a subscription here. Not going to wait a week. I've already waited 4 years for this.
---
Do you mean the polls on Reddit? If so I believe this would just show that WoW players who frequent Reddit are more likely to be in that age bracket.
---
They still did weekly restarts, no?
---
So update it... It's not hard

For me personally I only get 30mins of game time a day until the weekend due to work and class.
---
Best thing I can do until then is log in to my pc from my phone and loot the chest every 3 hours lol.
---
Thank you! I will try doing that!

Blizzard: "You may think we want to do it, but we won't."

This was way better than I thought it would be. Bravo!

But that's barrens! The only place for shitttslk
---
Well it’s the promotion of classic. If you are stuck in a two hour queue just to load it into classic. While most people will stay queued a bunch of people will jumpstart on to modern WoW instead and check back later. Then the is the people don’t fancy classic but want to play a little wow since there is a buzz in the area.
---
Can't you just put autoshot in your castbar? It's already there when you create a character.
---
Thats because you legit run out of stuff to do within a week in BFA aside from endless grinds. 
---
In Classic, people won't run out of things to do for 2-3 Months at LEAST
---
Hey blahs. Thanks a lot. Glad you enjoyed it. I’m from Germany. Ok :-) we gonna talk in chat then.
---
Lol and why did you delete your original post ? Enjoy your downvotes.
---
\&gt;dodge rating
---
\&gt;rating 
---
\&gt;in classic
---
Fewer.
---
Yeah I actually think this was something I adopted when I was learning to tank for that reason. Tagging you so you see this one too, u/hanaonly.
---
I hope they continue classic in next expansions and improve the game, learn from the past an make it like WOW 2.
---
Only being allowed 3 pets in Classic is kind of nice... It makes you think about what ones you really want.  For leveling, I think I'm going to go with Azzere, then once I get to the 40s I'll catch Old Cliff Jumper.  Then at 60, once I've learned all the pet abilities, I think I'll try to get Uhk'loc as my final one...
---
Is it possible to get live queue info for each server at a given time? Something like an app or website that tracks and reports the queue times.
---
You think Blizzard was bad before when it came to shutting down pservers, just imagine how relentless they’ll be if it’s directly cutting into their micro transaction profits.
---
&gt; They have explained why they can’t open more servers 
---
When have they explained this? I've seen no explanation as to how 3 US East PvP servers was ever deemed adequate.
---
It's pretty simple.  WoW Classic is included with any current subscription to World of Warcraft, so just resub, open the Battle.net launcher and head to the WoW tab.  Near the "Play" (or install) button should be a small drop down that you can change from current wow to Classic WoW.  Just install that, hit play, and sit in the queue with everyone else.  Happy hunting!
---
Goldshire on rattlegore chat was the same as when I last played the game in 2006. It was all g w bush and Iraq war talk.
---
It felt great because I started playing in 2006 after my stint in the army and three tours to Iraq.
---
Weird how things stay the same lol
---
I’m on rattle and I had one que for 30mins on launch and that’s it you guys just picked servers that were up prelaunch so they have way more people
---
Hmm. No
---
If you're brave enough.
---
It will also spread out, as on day 1 a lot of people are trying to stay on the servers they got character names on, which are the older servers. Steadily the populations will become better balanced as groups move to lower population servers.  
---
I think part of the problem is that "Low" and "Medium" are not actually Low or Medium populations. If the queues start at medium, then medium should be considered full or at least high. A lot of people will not want to go to a low or medium server because they will expect those servers to be dead when the initial player surge passess....and that is not the case.

Questing at the top of Teldrassil on my priest with a rogue friend who was doing the pickpocket the Satyr quest - I was running past a mob, about to kill him just because he was In my way until I saw a long beam tag him before my Shadow Word: Pain could tick to tag him. Thats okay, I didn't want to fight this guy anyway. I turn and see the Druid being chased by a nightsaber, the guy he stole from me AND the satyr and his 3 bodyguards because he got too close. Watched him die and didn't res him out of principle.
---
Me and my friends were in a party of 4 killing murlocs in Westfall.
---
We wiped, several times.
---
It was awesome.
---
I could, but it's not great having to give over a slot just for a basic attack
---
It’s not infinite but it is 3x the breath of all the other races
---
There may be some setting that helps, but if turning is the issue then cutting back on turning in general with this should help
---
God the piles of people around sarkoth was mad, I didn't even bother with doing either of the single mob quests in the valley of trials.

No worries. It happens!

“It’s legal” is literally all you can say state. That may be so, doesn’t mean it should be.

u made me chuckle
---
If you’ve been in game you’d see it’s not gonna be an issue. The zones are nuts packed. I haven’t been in a situation where I wasn’t competing for drops yet, often with multiple groups
---
How much did you damage it?
---
So? They said that layering should only be temporarily used, and many people on the community were even offended by that statement. They stated themselves that there will only be one layer going into phase 2, so they have to be careful to not blow up the realm too much, otherwise it'll be vastly overpopulated when layering is removed.
---
This exact mentality is what made classic so good, people just want to work hard and earn things.
---
So weird I got griefed for Garrick as well, but got helped with hogger as a level 6
---
Best thing about wow is the little Easter eggs like this.
---
I'd argue it's more like a large percent of the playerbase will flame out over the next month, with or without queues. Then you're talking about spinning up a bunch of servers that essentially die by Phase 2 just to mitigate a month at launch.
---
Reality is nobody has the hard numbers on this. Server merges and mass transfers will be a lot more disruptive for the players who stuck with the game, so it makes sense to align with the long-term players at the expense of short-term ones. Sure, it sucks, but if anyone is really dedicated they can just wait a month and start playing then. You miss the hype at launch, but you won't be shooting in the dark to pick a server for the next 2 years.
---
I am very surprised by the amount of "newbe questions" being asked in chat. I understand that a fair amount of them is trolling but there are many legit beginners questions that people are asking.
---
I am surprised because I expected everyone who plays classic to be farmiliar with wow overall. Being one of the vanilla players out there I completly underestimated the changes made to the game since, like COMPLETLY.
---
One example: the Stormwind auction house. Even I first ran to the wrong entrance when I first wanted to enter it yesterday. But I noticed my silly mistake, laughed about it and went ahead to the old entrance. A cataclysm-or later player will be very confused and will not know where the F to go. Hence chat is full of "Where is the AH in Stormwind?" or even "In which phase will the AH be implemented to SW?".
---
Seems so unreal nowadays
---
8 months is your thought?
---
So to avoid the potential disaster of merging servers, Blizzard has us in multi hour queues to play a monthly subscription game for upwards of 8 months.
---
Some big brain shit right there bro
---
Also not for me. Game crashed while levelling, restarted game and back in a 18k strong queue :)
---
BFA is *tedious*. You grind and grind and grind a number up to get some boring little buff or item level that becomes obsolete next patch and nobody cares about because all it shows is you mindlessly grinded and it becomes obsolete within a small amount of months. In classic you grind to get a big reward that you retain for a long time, and many of the grinds actually make for interesting stories (hitting max, killing bosses, world pvp). It may still be too much for some people but I think it provides a more appealing gameplay for most.
---
Level 19?? I was there at launch, ive pulled two crazy late nighters, work aside, ive put ever spare second in. Im level 6.
---
As soon as the first expansion of WOW launched i knew i was not happy with the direction blizzard was taking.
---
Instead of making the carrot on the stick taste much better by working to turn it into a cake - blizzard simply extended the stick over and over and over....
---
Having all my long earned gear ruined over night by green items was just depressing and did nothing but serve an endless tread mil of pointlessness.
---
Being in azeroth and then being sent "into space" to go and hang out with weird alien people was just so ridiculous to me lol, and not in a good way frankly....This gives the community/game a second chance in life....One which i hope they dont simply repeat past mistakes on.
---
And there go my 50 milk
---
Servers still need a cap otherwise they'll never converge down to a single layer without obscene queues. There's a balance point where servers *need* to keep people out.
---
They’re always 16 levels from being good 😂
---
I gave away 94k on wyrmrest accord. To a level 38 paladin I did /who 1-40 and found him in southern Barrens. I asked to purchase real estate. He wanted to sell me a place by the quillboar with the rare for 13 silver. He canceled the trade the first time genuinely asking about the trade saying that's not 13 silver. I told him I'm sure. The pally  accepted the trade the second time. I then mounted up and flew high in the air and dropped down and died. I died on my land. And the corpse of Shuman the shoe shining shaman that hates humans resides there. He didn't think the alliance was half bad. But that was all the expansions conditionings that did it to him.
---
Stop experience gain at 16 then
---
POOMP IT!
---
So. Much. Space.
---
I'm sorry mate, I've been getting my housemate to put me into the queue an hour before I leave work. That's the only way it has worked for me :/
---
Servers werent down or anything like, 2005.
---
So i realy dont think should or would do that

U can set it up through team viewer but u need wheter static ip adress or dns

“Want me wait on que?”
---
Lvl 24, menawhile me stucked in the queue
---
It's more akin to an arena than something like Netflix. There's going to be a finite capacity, and at some point you have to draw the line.
---
No most were talking about what will happen... and even those who did not encounter a lot of queues are not that organized or fast.... except the lone hunter :)
---
Lvl 11 with about 6 hours, so nah not too bad really
---
hope it helps. Just verified. The Camera option is called "camera following style". I changed that to Never. Play around with those settings.
---
The real TIL is always in the comments
---
I did yes :P
---
What do you mean Paladins aren't good at healing? *muh thinking emoji*
---
The thing is, that you is you. Not everyone else. I, too, expect a lot of people to leave by the end of the month as I think many are just curious and notice that it isn't for them. That doesn't mean it is going to be dead, but I doubt it will be able to hold even close as many players as it does right now over a long stretch of time.
---
Too bad your personal experience isn't universal. 8 eastern had  a queue .
---
Well people did want the classic experience!
---
I had a sleep and now i'm in 255 position!
---
That's a good point, I'll have to look that macro up when I get home.
---
yeah dude, wtf, how does that even happen?
---
I was playing as a lvl 12 human pally and when I got to the class quest I started the first part, but after getting to stormwind and turning in the quest tomb of divinity it bugged out and after trying to reset the addon it wanted me to run back to the quest giver in goldshire even tho I had already had the quest done
---
I'm pretty sure if you zone in and aggro anything then your locked to that instance until the reset.
---
Honestly? Because the player base asked for it.
---
We asked for easier travel, dungeon ques, LFR, etc.
---
Example: We only got AE looting because SWG did it first and people bitched enough that we got it in WoW too.
---
Retail is basically what happens when the players become the developers.
---
r/classicwowplus go and support the idea of a different timeline as blizzard are taking everything from the classic community into consideration when planning their next steps!! So we could see a brand new route for WoW.
---
If you want to tank more then 5 man dungeons warriors are the only way to go.
---
Too bad you didn't group with me, I strictly only need on things I actually need. (another warrior dps xD)
---
r/classicwowplus
---
I imagine they’ll probably quit before 60 all things considered and ultimately it IS just low-level gear, but it’s frustrating nonetheless. Too bad I don’t get to play with my friends thanks to queues 😕
---
If they could freely pump their servers pop, why would they make new ones than instead of pumping up pop tresholds, given they know that tourists are gonna leave?
---
Of course you made her play troll priest!
---
I have rebound A and D to moving in the left and right directions, they are usually Q and E and the Q and E are my OH SHIT buttons as they are the closest to movement.
---
enjoy drinking every 2 fights
---
The  queues  are way too long so i went Hydra waterlords. Playing on alliance as woop ( my name) so any dutch speaking peeps feel free to contact me .
---
Nothing changes lol, people will still play Retail and 8.3 when it comes out, a lot of people.
---
People on this sub just want to see retail to but that will not happen.
---
opps sorry - it copied over when i linked the URL
---
Pretty sure it depends on your gear
---
There was a guy in EU mograine at 35 6 hours ago.
---
Your weapon skill is probably low.
---
I'd love know if Blizzard make the number of players allowed on a server elastic or if it's a hard cap. From a tech perspective, 'spooling' up more resources for each server is super easy these days (Theoretically anyway. Maybe not for WoW servers). But you couldn't allow 100k people on one server at a time because it'd likely make the game awful. 
---
I'm fucking hating the long queue times. But it would make me feel better if Blizzard wrote up a tech blog post about the queues.
---
Depends on your guild raiding schedule and your job schedule but most raids ran from 7pm to 10/11pm.
---
whats the issue?  it's all "mainspec" gear since you tank and dps at will while leveling.  If I'm healing on my druid you bet your ass I'm rolling need on the agi/str gear too.
---
Barely made it a day and people already want QoL changes. This is how we got retail to the way it is.
---
Lol she chose troll and I figured priest is an easy way to start out.
---
Still levelling your weapon skill?
---
Queues will be gone in a week, maximum. Better haves kiddos crying for a week than dead servers for months
---
Classic wow just needs reforging.
---
They have the same problem as you do then. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to discuss their plans and see if they would be ok with switching servers. 
---
I played on arugal, it got crazy full and had a multiple hourlong queue, the entire guild changed to a different realm. We moved to a low pop server which if I compared it to a vanilla server, it still has a ton of people in it. 
---
Im just saying you have options. That’s kind of what vanilla is about. You can decide what to do man! :)
---
No real world discussions, this isn't Barrens chat
---
Dude stop you already killed him
---
Do you think it's more satisfying because you know everyone else has to go through this too? Like, you could start a char in retail and play similarly to classic, but it's empty because you know everyone else has the heirloom gear and is rushing to Max level where all the other players are.
---
I suppose now that I think about it, the reason they made levelling easy in the first place was because most people weren't levelling.
---
thats actually a smart move since you will get diminishing returns from doing grey quests for rep
---
NA - PVP - ANY SERVER
---
I have been playing since Vanilla, but only started raiding in TBC.  Stopped playing in BFA. Looking more for a 'family' of friends, for sure adult.  I love to play (nowadays) after having a drink or two, but don't fall alseep like some folks I've come against.  Looking primarily for fun during leveling, hopefully with voice.
---
Either way, Classic is what I've been looking forward to, but hasn't been a lot of fun playing alone.
---
I thought you couldn't mount in the cities in vanilla? Also, are the AH's linked at this point?
---
Same on the alliance. Around the 50s I remember grinding mobs and dungeons. There were either no quests or there were so spread out that it wasn’t worth doing them.
---
What are you talking about? That has nothing to do with why I suggested they use layering. I never claimed nor believe that layering removes people or doesn't count towards the population.
---
If I did follow the dog, I wouldn't sit at work right now... \*facepalm\*
---
Granted, and I appreciate this next line is going to be exactly what they all say but it's such a basic QoL change that I think the experience could survive it.
---
Doubt: press X
---
Why do games when you first open and play you have to spend the first half hour rebinding, turning down sensitivity from 80 to 2 and not have the game volume feel like your ear is next to a concert stereo :(
---
How do you do that? Do you go back to the trainer?
---
For weapon imbues, wouldn't whatever is the most recent you can train be the best? Like say 2 or 4 levels after you learn a rockbiter rank, you can train flametongue or frostbrand. That's usually how it works for lots of comparable abilities in this game
---
I still think you should get tiny xp for buffing non party members
---
The 'all grays' part is overdoing it a little bit I think, by WC you really do have mostly white quality gear with some greens at least. Still, almost got me to post 'trash tank gets carried through WC and complains LUL'.
---
Today I got in a single file line with 10 other dudes cause a warlock was offering to make bags if we give linen. Idk why stupid shit like this is so amazing. This game is lit as fuck.
---
I’m not sure, but it’s grown on me lol

---
Hide outline option, we will rename it since it causes confusion
---
&gt; I met 4 new people while fishing near brill and we all talked and fished for cooking
---
In retail's defense, fishing is just about the exact same. This probably only happened because people are hyped for classic, and are being more social because of it.
---
Otherwise, yea. I've grouped with people to do normal questing. I even grouped with someone to farm mobs for a bit, just because. I can't remember ever doing that in the last 5 years of retail.
---
it can kinda tank two, but not hold threat against both, but dotting 2 targets, fearing one and killing the other with the vw tanking is pretty efficient.
---
I try to only need the things that are strictly upgrades personally. Almost everything there was an upgrade tho lol
---
Mograine
---
What sorcery is this?
---
Remember when you had to like spam cities and say "Need a tank"? 
---
Remember those bugs we fixed two years ago? Still there in the past.
---
I'll  raise you I got in the server once so far and I'm level 2
---
Boo

Gamers buy Apple computers?
---
Disgrace of the Horde
---
I would of rather they simply made the end game better than simply ADD more levels.
---
Some of us were really happy with our judgement armour and did not want to bin it for some green "alien" armour :/
---
I used it without having any problem.
---
If it's not your turn to loot but the mob has a quest item in it that your friend doesn't need you have to wait for your friend to finish looting (some times empty enemy) so you can loot the quest item after that.
---
Exactly, it seems like people went from saying “Blizzard will never bring back vanilla” to now “classic will not last long it’ll def die out” type bs. I’ve been having a blast and don’t intend to stop anytime soon, I wanna hit 60 and run all those raids and enjoy the world for what it is.
---
An elf in the snow is better than ten on the roof.
---
We have no idea what the current population cap is before queues kick in.
---
Where's the part where you play for half an hour and get disconnected?
---
Okay, then they should add more servers.
---
Is that like the store brand grob mob?
---
Nodes can only be tapped 10 times before despawning. Multiboxers with more than 10 accounts tend to do hyperspawn farms on multiple shards instead. That is, they kill mobs over and over again for the raw gold, greens which are vendored, cloth to AH, and chance at epic boes and world drop mounts.
---
wait... did you play on EU Bronzebeard by any chance?
---
And what do you do when both servers have a mage called Frostbolt who is very pleased with having snagged that name on their server. Who keeps the name? Who loses out?
---
Another proof that average age of the guys who play classic is really high. What kind of "out of touch with tech stuff" solution is this?
---
Counter-example: yesterday (technically, launch day) there was a major crash on Faerlina and a similar one on Skeram.  I was on Skeram with a group of about ten in discord, like half of us got disconnected simultaneously, but most of those people who got disconnected were able to reconnect, even though it was clearly a server crash.  Some of us were not able to reconnect, however - presumably the same thing that happened to Asmongold happened to me.
---
Honestly though, who knows at this point.  They very well could have changed/fixed something.
---
Well... We're all Alliance mains, so that probably explains it. Different worlds. ;)
---
No that’s just enabling you carrying that weapon. Besides that you need “experience” with it. You need a large amount of swings at mobs to increase you weapon skill.
---
You can't raid with more than one group afaik. Once you clear raid bosses they vanish for the remainder of the week and you're locked in that. The lock happens after the first boss. At least that's how I remember it.
---
It is not bannable if you speak other language in chat
---
Yeah it’s global I have to invite people when making bags and they say : “where are you ?” And I’m like layering and invite them. I post a macro with the bags mat info and they see it even in different layers.
---
They're not selling. No one has that money.
---
You level it up with hitting things. There will be constant text saying that your two-handed skill goes up for a while. Then it stops once it reaches whatever the cap is at your level.
---
Grinding for the mage, questing for the hunter. None of them cam so it's impossible to know if they're actually 2-3 people playing the same account.
---
I ended up doing this for a short period of time, it was insane how many messages I got from people asking for bags. Easy tailoring levels
---
I would do the same if I rolled a druid.  
---
A lot of people don't like it though, since they're stuck in the "already max level"-mentality.
---
It’s a good way yes :) good choice!
---
Hitting level 12 is quick. But getting to level 60 takes a long time especially if you don’t play one of the super easy to level classes like hunter, warlock and feral Druid.
---
Thats the way of an actual rpg game :D
---
Definitely Q or E has to be a F SHIT. NOPE NO, NO! GOTTA YEET! IM GONNA DIE. GOTTA GO! Button.
---
....grats you've invented layering
---
0 at level 10
---
I have smote (had to look that up as "smited" looked wrong haha) so many boars this past day. Finally left Dun Morogh and logged out at level 12. 
---
Why am I so excited to log back in and smite more mobs and drink more water???
---
Do skinning vendor all your leather till you get good stuff at a higher level then go mining and bank everything you mine for when you hit 60 and go engineering
---
Then they should take advantage of layering, you know, the thing they implemented to prevent this. If they think the current number of servers is going to be sufficient long term, then add more layers. If they think there will be too many layers, then add more servers. Either way, there shouldn't be obnoxious queues on so many servers.
---
does retail have spanish servers?
---
That's how it should be. I love completing zones even if I get too less experience.
---
Oh my god this is awesome, thank you. Please make another round where you describe raids or so!
---
Keep hitting things and check your weapon skill. You are probably glancing all the time due to low skill. It will improve in time.
---
I'll be honest, I didn't think it was that harsh.
---
Well, I’m at work, scrolling classic subReddit... 
---
waiting to be able to connect at 12...
---
Gawd! I want to play :(
---
Trying to get to TBC that bad huh ? \^.\^
---
Rockbiter is optimal for slow weapons as it scales the best, on quick weapons i would use flamtounge or windfury when you have it. Wf on slow weapons isn't optimal as it ofzen overkills or doesnt procc at all
---
&gt;Rogues have some aggro reduction tools that warriors don't have.
---
A vanish for Fury Warriors would be quite useful indeed. 
---
&gt;once we get rolling into T2+
---
T2 warrior set is what I'm here for &lt;3
---
Took work off yesterday and played for 10 hours before kicking kicked. 100% worth it.
---
I keep attack on a bar to see when my auto is active but it's not bound.
---
Right-Click. But yeah, i like wasting binds.
---
(Also, with launch population spawn-camping every low lv mini boss, you can spam 1 to autoattack right on spawn.)
---
6-8 hours queues are not acceptable - period. And people spewing "just switch servers" should shut up already. I already did switch - to new low-pop server that I played before work and got to 10, after work I was placed in a 6 hours queue. I now leveled second time to lvl 10 on yet another new realm, and there are queues there already.
---
Stop white-knighting for a corporation. People pay money for this.
---
Nooooooooo I was under the (apparently wrong) assumption that streamers were staying away from Fairbanks?
---
And it’s still not gonna happen.
---
Have you played hunter and rogue both? What class is more fun to play ? I heard hunter requires to kite more so that should be fun. I like active playstyle.
---
I’m with you... Yesterday hit me in the feels... there’s no shortcuts, you are rewarded for your effort, not loot handed to you for everything you do...
---
As a warrior...
---
You only have skills that cost rage.
---
Except charge, which isnt always the best option
---
Its also faster to click the auto attack hotkey and have your char attack whatever is cloeset.. handy for wanting to kill a mob as soon as it spawns
---
Does anyone have a rough estimate as to how many people are actually playing? What is "high" population currently? What's full?
---
Wait, I don't play retail, there's no changes of time in retail?!!
---
Gamling EU was medium yesterday but there was 7k in queue.. 2,t hours wait. And people were worried this server would be dead.
---
Reddit will Always impress me
---
I mean it's not like you are wasting valuable space with your 3 other abilities you regularly use. Makes me not have to use the mouse if I feel too lazy.
---
To bad thete isn't any data for EU :&lt;
---
if you employ people, you are not a loser, was my point. what have you written there?
---
how you can employ 20 people and created an iconic game and be a loser?
---
Not in USA, mate (see, he called it Labor).
---
Depends. If you use the standard windows function for sending a key, it's detectable. If you make your own driver for a keyboard, they can look at the driver control codes to see if they look wrong. But the way to actually do it undetected is to intercept the control codes from your real keyboard and rebroadcast them under the same driver as your auto clicker. You would use this https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363216(v=vs.85).aspx
---
That's undetected.
---
I haven't bought it yet, saving gold ;-;
---
If you plan to play solo. SL warlock and shadowpriest.
---
Set this up yesterday to be able to start the queue a few hours early while at work.
---
Not really since weapon imbues scale with your level until you reach the level for the next rank
---
Yeah I hear if you disconnect it saves your spot for a few seconds say if your just browsing the very next server but go back to your original you would be very close to what you left on. Not the end of the line. So ppl not paying attention that disconnect are screwed for another 4+ hours if they dont try to reconnect in time.
---
Too bad it is a third party source. And it's wrong.
---
It's been discussed to the death a long time ago and simply put, because they actually have to be in front of the computer and press physical keys it's not considered automation or botting.
---
That's what will happen to dead servers. Might not be till a year from now but they will not keep paying for a server with a 100 people on it.
---
I know, but i was not expecting to hit 12 at all in one night.
---
On my screenshots it clearly says that the win shift s shortcut got introduced  in win 10. 
---
I said the native win shift s shortcut is not available in windows 7 by default. OneNote is not windows 7.  
---
My links are relevant to windows 7 because they explicitely state that this function was introduced in win 10.  
---
I can code a tool for win xp that does that with the same shortcut. That doesn't mean win xp natively supports that functionality.  
---
Have fun laughing using your one note shortcut and not understanding what this is about. I hope your boss doesn't know how good youare atyour job.
---
Wow I didn't even know this was a thing. To be honest, classic for me was a "I'll probably play it between content patches" when it was first announced, but honestly I'm looking at getting invested long term again, coming from someone who quit retail almost a year ago.
---
This. WPvP is my main focus on live, too. It's just fun for me.
---
To clarify, I don't just mean ganking lowbies or clearly undergeared people, I usually go for people who are equal or better geared, or 1v2+ just to challenge myself.
---
Aah Mine is only lvl 7 :(
---
Enjoy your experience. You are very lucky, because you are in the right place at the right time :) What a blast!
---
LOL all too real
---
Yo dawg..
---
What is he supposed to calm down about?
---
He stated his opinion which, by the way, is completely accurate.  
---
During the short time I got to play I made bags for other players, traded items, formed groups in the open world... what an MMORPG should be.
---
You can argue that retail WoW is more of a lobby game like Diablo 3. No world, no immersion, no feeling of community.
---
*Meow*
---
People are selling things like cloth and leather for their vendor price on my realm... I think some haven't quite figured it out yet.
---
Amazing lmao
---
This gives me PTSD just thinking about when I was first there during BC. Everyone arguing about what to do.  
---
Now, I live in a different country and still trying to get a grasp on the language. I thought it a good idea to play on the local language server. Just thinking about going into ST now..... OMG what did I do?!?!?
---
Im no expert in world pvp but palas can be hard to kill... they dont deal a lot of dmg though
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=4941
---
Wow never seen this here before. Very special picture
---
Thunder bluff has a shortage of cooking fires.  neither the forge near the AH nor the campfire in front of Cairne work.
---
I was against layering because i felt it would take  away from the sense of community and the world. But to be honest, the starting area had about 150 people running around it when i logged on, probably more than that so if layering is hiding another 150 thats fine, they're disabling it as the population spreads out but really seeing a couple of hundred people instead of 400 or 500 isn't breaking anything, if there were 500 people running around you'd still probably never see the same person twice.
---
The issue is he has already picked like 6 realms and can't play ANY of them or continue where he has left off or where he has made friends already...
---
Depends, are you only doing WPVP? If you want to get into raiding and such, then I would go rogue since they are just so much better at doing damage and scale good with gear. If you are more of a solo player and don't really care for min/max, a hunter is good choice. You should also go after one of the broken pets, like lupos or broken tooth. Just remember that you need to feed your pets, learn skills and such for them.
---
Exactly so evens out like the PP said.
---
The multiboxer takes the same time to farm enough gold for 20 tokens as it takes one person to farm enough gold for 1 token...but the multiboxer has 20 accounts to pay for.
---
OP of that post is clear current retail player. No crashes, just some queues and it's already a failure that needs a formal apology. Get over yourself.
---
Yeah that's why we moved from Herod to Stalagg.  Turned out to be pointless.
---
Im level 14. Played 10ish hours. No rush.
---
Cata baby here. Never grew up with vanilla but spent a fair amount of time on private servers. Haven't got into classic yet (waiting until I get paid this weekend) but almost everyone I know who is into wow are absolutely loving it (and all of us started after tbc). Classic isn't just about nostalgia it's a game with such different design goals than most over games releasing now which makes it feel so fresh and fun.
---
Join a friendly guild who like helping and don't be afraid to ask questions!
---
I guess they don’t want to take away from the whole “world/realm first 60”?
---
Xd
---
Isn't it the opposite? Most expansions in retail act like you're a f**king god.
---
Classic makes you a nobody again.
---
this
---
Well, if you're not tanking, it has next to zero value. :/ That's sad. But I'm fine with looking like a clown if I can top the peepee meter lol
---
why bother queuing for 5 hours? you can't have a character worth 5 hours of a wait yet and even medium pop servers have a 2-4k queue with all the beginner zones completely wedged with players.
---
I actually was using the same chassis and hard drive from the PC I built in 2008 up until last spring when I finally got a totally new build. I gave it to a coworker and he's using it as a media server now! It may have felt like a lot of money for a case at the time (I think it was $125 when I bought it), but I sure as hell got my money's worth, and then some.
---
Enh shaman is very strong, but also very dependant on rng, atleast to some degree.
---
If you get bored of enhance shaman though you can just respec elemental, less rng but equally powerful, also very fun to play.
---
Watch out for good warriors, rogues and paladins. If you're better than them you will most likely win the fight. The rest of the classes aren't really a threat, depending a bit on your spec though
---
pve server lul
---
Portugese as well
---
I'm the boxer in this picture, and this is my exact ideology. Minding my own business, and not disturbing other players in any ways. I 20box in retail, so I thought it would be fun change to try boxing Classic, which I never done before. I started this hobby in pre-Cata, and have done it since.  
---
At first it was quite frustrating to read comments about how I should get banned, and have no life, and what else. but now 10 years later I'm still doing it and will automatically leave behind all the negative comments made by users without further knowledge what multiboxing actually is all about. I'm aware that there have been a few rotten tomatoes in the basket, giving multiboxers nothing but really bad reputation, which really is a shame. With my point of view all the boxers I've met on my travels are very amazing players and persons.
---
or win+shift+s and you can select a part of the screen to save.
---
Yeah same here. Haven't had this much fun playing an MMORPG in the last 9 years. The community is great, so many peeps helping out with quests.
---
I simply went to bed and slept through the queue
---
i saw 32 on luci some mins ago
---
Yeah but you can right click it
---
None. Stayed on bigglesworth. Before three on release I hoped on my character screen and never left. I had no que and instantly got in. This morning had a 5min que. This evening had a 4 hour almost. Eh it will happen. I'll live with it.
---
Fair enough lol
---
Yeah you can imagine the look on my face as I rounded to corner and walked up to see it, lol.
---
I have began theorising on a conspiracy. I have gotten a random disconnect two times after playing around three hours. Couldn't log in --back to 15k queue. Yet one time when I actually accidentally disconnected my internet connection, I could log back in right ahead. Now, what if, Blizzard is deliberately disconnecting people to get the queue going? Maybe that, or it is a glitch and the 22h marathon sitting on my computer has made me paranoid.
---
There was some 32 hunter and 30 mage on my realm (ZT) two hours ago.
---
It's great, what's a queue?
---
The general opinion that Classic will die soon is ridiculous.
---
There have been private servers for a decade with population larger than that of many standalone MMORPGs.
---
Even if 2/3 of the current players left we’d have more than enough players (remember 1 server now has 4 times the capacity of Vanilla servers)
---
This was what my experience was like. I think it was because a layer was opened/restarted. I skipped the cut scene and EVERYONE was in the crypt and swarmed out into an empty quest area. Clicking the first quest NPC was a nightmare. I managed to get SLIGHTLY ahead of the mob during the first couple of quests so I was killing quests NPCs without much competition while people were spamming General chat looking for groups to kill zombies.
---
Grind is in gehennas aswell
---
It wssnt broken in the first place, the population was coded to be relevent to the full servers, so compared to the full servers it was at medium populatuon, but now it shows how full it actually is no matter what the other server populations are at
---
You can have niche guilds that have members that work nights. They'd raid normally in the morning when it's your "evening/nighttime".
---
If you can't find one, make one. Nightshifts workers are pretty common these days.
---
&gt; I heard hunter requires to kite more so that should be fun. I like active playstyle.
---
Mage is similar to that playstayle as well, but plays it better due to having lots of crowd control in the form of sheep and their freezes.
---
It is. If you want to keep the IP, you HAVE to make an effort to protect it in some way. So its highly likely that they dont neccessarily *want* to, but *have* to.
---
I'm waiting for them to start taking a picture of their phone screen with another phone.
---
"It's just easier."
---
questie
---
or classiccodex
---
or guidelime with the guidelime Sage extension I think its Alliance
---
&gt;The queues aren't going to last long probably anyway.
---
not sure about that one
---
Great comeback when you've been proven wrong and got nothing else to say, bud.
---
Rained for 2 hours in Tirisfal glades. Made the Area so much gloomier and harder to spot the enemy. Loved every second.
---
I cannot take two mobs of equal level as a warrior and I love it!
---
Stonks
---
Say that to the hunter who keeps pulling in Wailing Caverns when I am struggling to get rage enough for a Sunder Armor, which ain't happening because the hunter has aggro.
---
Im the complete opposite.  I never played vanilla so I was super hyped to play classic.  Things definitely haven't lived up to my expectations.  I will continue to play in hopes that I enjoy it more though.
---
Mining is easy since getting out of copper is quick with smelting giving skillups. You'll still see certain zones still have Tin Veins at like level 30. You may run into random zones that are far too high for your mining but then it shifts back. It's kind of all over the place. Iron is in just about every zone
---
43
---
Guild Wars 2 does expansions better than wow retail did. It's got problems too of course, but it has nailed the feeling that *most* of the world is alive and useful.
---
Elysiums launch had 2 servers capped out at 10k and another server with a 10k queue on top of that.
---
And that’s why they didn’t make a bunch of extra servers.
---
Multi boxing seems like such a small problem for the amount of people who complain about itm

---
With a hotfix to WoW Classic a few moments ago, we’ve changed how the realm population labels work in order to display realm populations in a more meaningful way.
---
**How it worked before this hotfix**
---
As we explained [here 801](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/medium-pop-still-has-login-queue/271551/10?u=kaivax), the system previously calculated the population labels by comparing all realms to the most-populated realm. This could result in a very crowded realm (with a lengthy queue) showing up as “Medium”, since it was being compared to the realm that had the highest population and a potentially massive queue.
---
**How population labels work now**
---
Thank you very much!
---
Best wait a week. I have level 8-10 characters on a few realms. Dancing between them while i see where things settle down. In a week is when classic really begins.
---
I didn't say that 25g was the bottom price. I meant that some people are asking that much for them.
---
True story
---
Yes, from my experience a 9,000 que’s took about 6 hours and a 3,500 que took about 2 and a half-ish hours
---
Maybe us older peeps with responsibilities need to wait for people to drop the game and go back to Minecraft and Fortnite.
---
How would they scale dynamically without disconnecting people? Each continent is one massive shard
---
Oh dude I clicked my ability for like the first 8 months of playing. You used to have to learn best practices through osmosis of having friends that knew better, now you have the hive mind of Reddit to steer you along! One of us!
---
Yeah, I meant that the highest prices I've seen have been 25g.
---
Because, reddit, this is layering/sharding.
---
We’re either OK with layering/sharding or we’re not OK with layering/sharding, it can’t be both.
---
You do realize if you could move freely between realms as you suggest, it would impact both server economy and community?
---
Yeah, but it might change over time. Right now everyone is a low level char. In some weeks the levels are far away, so less ppl to meet and the group restrictions in classic are also worse then retail. like shared exp.
---
Judging from experience, sooner or later cancer will be back. Most are just hyped now and behave normally for once online.
---
We won't get free game time. Its the same with the free character transfers. Blizz could ask everyone to use the lower pop servers then give free transfers later so everyone can get back to their communities. But every free transfer is a £15 that blizz isn't getting for paid transfers so they do not want to do it. Same with Free Game time. They lied about the name reserves just to get free resubs only to refused to address the server population problems and have everyone move servers.
---
The same thing goes with the Beta-Stress-test. To attend you had to have an active wow sub so Blizz never got a feel for the real numbers of people playing because they wanted to put their testing behind a paywall. I am not resubbing to play a beta realm only to lose my progress and wait a month for the game's release. This reeks of Activation and its destroying Blizzard at an alarming rate.
---
ShareX is all I gotta say.
---
No, you can't
---
Having a blast!
---
I'd love the OSRS voting with 75%+ needed for changes.
---
The bigger question is, what's better for Blizzard and the players?
---
Should they first re-release TBC? Adding a crazy amount of content for very little work thanks to the classic foundation seems logical and there where more players in TBC than vanilla WoW, making the decision to proceed to the next expansion theoretically favorable. 
---
On the other hand, some changes implemented by TBC clash hard with the Classic world, flying mounts for example.
---
So I'd say the best outcome (clearly just my opinion here) would be that they continue to TBC, asking all players an one time question (during a specific period of time, to prevent dead classic realms down the road) if they want to stay or head to a TBC realm. 
---
Once this is done they have plenty time to adjust to an OSRS like voting-system if this is the goal all while we can enjoy the more refined gameplay and talent trees. 
---
I'd personally love to have the flying limited to Outlands, so if future content ever gets added we'd have ground mounts for Azeroth while having the possibility to still use flying or/and adding content for it there.
---
Same here. A little blip on statecraft 2 while I waited.
---
  if you treat your employees, customers community, etc., like shit, your business suffers.   
---
you mean like firing 800 people and then hiring replacements at half the salary despite posting record profits? that kind of behaviour? cos the stock prices loved that.
---
I stayed on char screen for ~2 hours on launch day (napping until launch) and didn't get kicked. Unless they implemented the kick timer yesterday, I don't think it's present.
---
Que from work with Google Remote Desktop
---
Would like to do that, but I'm living in an appartment where most of the power is turned off when you dont have the key inside. Sucks that I can't access my computer from work, so I'm waiting for another 24k queue after work. Feels Good Man!
---
Would your experience not be better if you changed to a less populated server? I understand that you might have friends in this one, but personally I'd rather have a good experience alone than a bad experience with everyone else.
---
yeah loomZ from dreamstate just confirmed that to me on his stream
---
This is one of the best posts I've seen here so far. I think you did a really good job explaining everything to your friend. Especially the weird elemental shit :)
---
A true hydro homie
---
I told my friends to not sub cuz queues. They add more servers or they will lose a big chunk of players
---
Thought about that, was too lazy to set it up, fk me i guess
---
I got level 6 after about 3.5 hours last night...
---
Here I am at level 15 woohoo
---
It’s my friends on whitemane that piss me off, how the hell are we suppose to play together when sitting in 6-7 hour queues are the norm

I dunno, sometimes I found myself spacing out and thinking "wait, am I attacing?" and then I have a blinking icon to remind me that I do.

Completely fair, checking input is a good approach and solves the most common way of anti-afk.  
---
But, now you have to distinguish between any of the hundreds of scripting softwares and keyboard/mouse softwares ( things like razer synapse, logitech gaming software, corsair utility engine ). You wouldn't want to ban Tom, who is a legit player, but bound his extra mouse button to numpad 1.
---
Not to mention scree shots were a thing in 2004.
---
Hotkey faster than click...and i use macros to auto with skills
---
Someone doesnt know dick about anti cheat software 👀
---
Just do the quest when you do the gnome toolboxes. there are plenty of makrura and crabs.
---
Cheers fellow mage!
---
shamans are godlike versus casters and arent directly countered by anything. you might lose some 1v1s here and there but typically most fights go your way if you have a slight advantage and you’ll beat most evenly geared opponents the majority of the time if you make no mechanical errors. you have a low cd ranged interrupt in earth shock, put rank 1 on your bars as well to use when low on mana so you always have an interrupt. protect your grounding totem instead of letting it get killed, although some good players will wand it. some fights your grounding totem will be close to coming off cd before it absorbs something. grounding totem absorbs a lot of spell effects, such as warrior intercept stun. 
---
if your primary focus is pvp, go tauren. your healing animation is the same cast animation as hearth stone. you can cast hearth stone to bait our enemy interrupts. always take the 70% uninterruptible during healing talent. war stomp is god like, as it is another interrupt that allows you to protect your grounding totem or wait for earth shock cd. it can also give you a free lesser healing wave cast. i highly recommend you do not listen to guides telling you orcs are the best simply because of stun resist. your primary racial mortal strikes you for a long time and you will self heal in almost every fight unless your opponent is trash, or a mage. 
---
purge is also one of your most important abilities in pvp. it allows you to put rogues in combat from range, put warriors in combat from range, and you should start off every fight by purging. almost every mage have buffs on bars with no bindings and wont put their ice armor spell on while fighting, same for warlocks and priests with their self buffs. most people click those, so when they have a shaman raping them in world pvp they will do dumb shit like cast ice barrier or my personal favorite, sac void walker for shield only to have it purged. always purge paladins every single time they put up a seal, they will do nothing.
---
i dont remember how wf works on classic patch vs the old over powered version, i know it cant proc itself, but im not sure if they nerfed the way it crit. if someone is sitting, your attack will guaranteed crit. windfury procs on sitting targets would give all crits and would just completely obliterate people. sometimes you would get ganked, res on someone drinking near your corpse, and obliterate them.
---
you will love shaman.
---
The social pressure when your friend just skips the line is real
---
How does breaking the fourth wall work on RP servers? Is it okay if I say I'm super stoked about classic being back and all that stuff, even if it isn't in character?
---
(I got no clue how hardcore the RPing actually is on those servers)
---
The longest queue I’ve had on Ashkandi was 15 minutes, even on launch night 2 hours after launch
---
Fixed the list! tried to update on mobile (mistake)
---
I respect your opinion. But honestly, I don't remember making you the spokesperson for the 25-44 year olds..
---
Queueing is sometimes neccessary for you to enjoy a great game.
---
I enjoyed leveling back in the day because I met people, and made friends. I think the retail end game provides these things for people today but it feels like the rest of the game is just an afterthought. In vanilla you leveled up while making friends and socializing, and then at end game you made friends and socialized. It feels like the whole game has a purpouse to me. Retail leveling feels like being in a theme park that doesn't prepare you for the end game, while classic leveling molds you for something bigger.
---
Both of those expansions were pretty great on their own( although I did not like being on Argus). Haven’t had the chance to play classic yet but I am excited for it, the biggest draw for me has got to be the community and the passion behind it. It really makes the game feel more alive that way.
---
Ahh stop it you're making me regret wanting to play warlock. Used to play druid and always drive-by healed/buffed everyone I passed
---
Unplug your refrigerator, plug in PC. It is delivery service only for the next months anyway-
---
Are you sure your hotkeys are bound correctly?
---
My Imp attacks just fine. I also put attack on the upper left button "^" (no idea if reddit shows it or interprets it as something else).
---
Since I need it every fight Ctrl+1 would be too inconvenient.
---
But I also think about putting attack on mousewheel up and passive on mousewheel down.
---
Same here, came home 17:30 - enter queue of 20k people. Was able to log in in at 10:05, played 30 min before going to sleep. Going to try accessing my PC remotely today to enable the queue an hour or so before I head home.
---
I'd say wait a week or two. Right now is a horrible time to try.
---
Hi, /u/President_Bacon
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwhq48/is_there_a_guidebook_for_classic_wow_ive_never/). 
---
Well everyone did expect long queues, that doesn't make it alright. In my opinion, making excuses for a billion dollar game company not being able to launch a 15 year old game without queues is delusional. I think it's alright as a consumer to expect a product you pay for to work. Blizzard could just increase layering to avoid queues and dead servers.
---
&gt;  it screams entitlement 
---
No. If you buy a new phone that doesn't work for the first week or two of purchase, you would complain and the company would jump right in to set you up with a new one. In the digital age, this is really not that different. We must up uphold game companies to the same standard that we do everyone else.
---
It’s been 34 hours since launch. I have 25 hours /played.
---
Back to reality tomorrow.
---
Can you link his twitch?
---
Yeah, as queues get worse people who would've logged off hours ago decided to keep playing in order to avoid the hassle of getting back into the server.
---
Not trying to make a political statement, but it's the same reason making it a huge pain in the ass to cross the border only serves to increase the illegal immigrant population.
---
You're not jumping every 3 minutes and 28 seconds. You're jumping every random(1,100000) seconds, strafing every random(1,1000000) seconds, casting a heal or hearthstone every random(1,1000000) seconds.  
---
Even if most implementations of random generators in software is just pseudo-random, it's still enough to generate different results every time it is called.  
---
I don't underestimate the power of anti-cheat technology, I know it's limitations.
---
7/8M.
---
Just look at his DPS logs then. Shouldn't be too hard for you to look at his logs yourself.
---
I completely agree. Sick of people that say "uu server queue thats ur fault for joining a populated server dumbass" honestly just gtfo instead of being an annoying twat. If they would even think for a second why people don't want to go on low pop I wouldn't be this triggered.
---
only reason i would disagree with that is that a friend of mine got a bug where he couldnt turn in any quests at all which effectively forced him to relog, but it let him back in right away even during a 5hr queue on grob. so if it was intended sabotage, it wasn't effective sabotage.
---
This, I decided to take the less known questing routed to avoid the major crowds and have had a great time playing. 90% chance you'll get your desired name on a new server
---
I checked the AH to see how expe dive stuff is.  There were BoEs up for 40ish gold.  Stacks for leather for 17g.  No way is anyone buying those.  People waiting their money posting those.
---
 Have you heard of teamviewer ?
---
inside your World of Warcraft folder in the "\_classic\_" folder there should be a folder named screenshots with all your WoW classic screenshots, also like other people have said you can use paste to put whatever screenshotted into a paint program.
---
i'd say let's wait a month or two and see how many players contione playing. because thats what matters.
---
Yea I got on around 8am my server time today and only a 380 person que, then had to log off around noon and got back on around 1:30 and up to a 3,000ish que
---
It feels just like coming home in a sense. Last night I witnessed a couple of people RP and stuck around for an hour following that player driven content unfold, it was fantastic. This morning I logged in while eating breakfast to pick some flowers "before everyone else had a chance to get out there". It's been a long time since a game made me this immersed in the world this quick. Probably around 2004. In Vanilla.
---
Good point. It's "Worlds of Various States of Conflict" in retail these days.
---
Obviously paladin -&gt; all about the bubble hearthstone when things don’t go your way :D
---
Even if people don't quit they will definitely stop playing all day long as they are doing now.
---
[His twitch is exactly what you'd expect it to be.](http://twitch.tv/Alkaizerx)
---
Keep seeing this banded about, i  essence you're right but what worries me is when the tourists leave these new servers are going to be dead ghost towns...
---
Ye’, But can’t find This one on Wallpaper Engine
---
There is always gonna be meme prices
---
Where are your boots?
---
Lol lots of people were holding down there arrow key or using scripts to jump. 
---
I literally came into an inn and saw this guy jumping behind the inn counter over and over. I eent out did 3-4 quests came back hes still jumping in the same awkward place xD
---
herb with what?
---
There's a pretty significant difference between selling a linen bag for 25g and listing a linen bag for sale for 25g
---
Yep, it's only when I go from logged into the game itself to the login screen to the game itself. I know it's my account, it's the same username I have used since supernintendo came out and I have never had it taken before.
---
Shite friends
---
It's all about context. If this guy uses this for a short while because he has a small errand too run while having to wait for 5+ hours in queue, i totally understand it. The guy can't choose the moment he enters the world and now finally got a space, just when he needed to do somthing small.
---
If this guy just went to sleep and wants to reserve his place then i have no sympathy whatsoever.
---
Oh, I see now. It's additive, not time taken each level. Sorry it was throwing me off a little
---
With enough player reports, yes a GM would/should intervene. But that requires players actually doing their part and reporting, which doesn't really give an incentive.
---
Why wouldn't you skip that quest? Super inefficient.
---
Yes they know a lot more than you, you only a customer my dude.
---
Actually tried that and was surprised you couldn’t. I figured they were two different games so why would they share the same box? Oh well- hope they change that soon.
---
Imagine trying to log on during the hours most would or should be at work during the week and still seeing a 5 hour queue. Then you disconnect around 45 minutes left and suddenly its 1pm and you have an 8 hour queue. GG.
---
Crazy. Everyone expected Herod to be WAY too packed but between adding servers and streamers going to Faerlina it ended up being one of the lower pop of the original servers. Meanwhile I'm on Whitemane. Yikies
---
Ahh the advantage of playing on a laptop. I sat on the train in the queue tethered to my phone yesterday evening :)
---
I never played a pet class. But makeing a new one wont fix your problem. 
---
My guess is that you are having troubles with imp phaseshift.
---
I have hired my girlfriend to join the queues while I sleep.
---
Teamwork makes the dream work.
---
I was in the same mindset as you. Till I saw the blue post that they’re releasing servers at a rate in which they believe is necessary for each and every realm to have a healthy pop. A realm now supports 30k people whereas back then it was 10k.
---
I switched to one of the new servers when my original choice Stalagg had a dumb long queue.  It felt like it was just my group of friends by ourselves on launch, but today the place was thriving. 
---
Yeah we had a bit of a wait today now that more people have came over, but at least it's not a 6+hr queue.
---
I think it's cus the mob dropped nothing. Maybe.
---
Yup. It's been very well optimized through the years. I didn't have a monster PC by any means back in the day - *It was built from mostly scrap parts from my mom's workplace* - but it was respectable. Wow ran like shit and I still played it.
---
Hat's off to a really cool community that talks to each other and helps a fellow azerothian!
---
Yeah its insane. My fiance knows I'm still close friends with my GM from vanilla  and she asked me if we were talking on discord and I said "Actually I'm talking to the guy who used to be a healer in our raid group back then, I haven't talked to him in over a decade"   
---
Sitting in a discord call with 10 people, some I haven't talked to in years is the best experience. And more people are slowly reaching out to us from Facebook and even the WoW forums.
---
I had so much fun playing yesterday. I never played vanilla before (Started in Wrath) but i just talked to people in general chat for like 1,5 hours when i quested. I have never been so socially active in a game before.
---
Nobody gives a shit lol
---
Skills you had to go learn and level up...
---
I agree Blizzard handled this launch very poorly, but I'd expect nothing else by this point.  
---
At the very least you're pretty much guaranteed that paid transfers will be a thing.  
---
So you could just roll on a lower population realm, and pay the $15 if it turns out be dying or is horribly imbalanced.  
---
I think those $15 is worth not spending **LITERALLY DAYS** in queue over the next month.
---
That's how you get the china gold seller gold.  You list stuff on AH for stupid amount and they buy it after you pay them irl.  Not saying that's what is happening here, but that's how it's done.
---
To be fair, I'm playing with my girlfriend, so it's taking us longer to complete collection quests, and we've dabbled in a few professions and exploration. 
---
We are taking our time!
---
yup i was queueing from pos ~6000 and got in at around 1200
---
That would be nice. I'd like to farm up some more WoW tokens while waiting for 11-12 hours lol
---
&gt;  imp phaseshift
---
level 12 spell that requires a grimoire
---
You get disconnected 30 min on the dot, what i do is i have chrome remote desktop set up on my phone, i log in use the movement pad to move in a direction, log off and set up a timer for 20 min just in case something happens irl and I can't log in immediately.
---
Then you add it and try to animate it!
---
Dungeons until late level 60 stuff you can easily tank with arms/fury tree.
---
Prot warriors are only really needed for raids iirc.
---
So I play D&amp;D, I really enjoy the old school style of doing what you want, small fry, go on an adventure, earn your shit.
---
I remember on session we were playing, and I won a puppy from a stand at a fair. It was great because it was nothing to do with the story and we were just having fun. I thought it was great, the DM thought it was great, we moved on, I had my in game puppy that I cared about.
---
The problem is, my DM really like it, and wanted to make it cooler and tell an awesome story, so the the dog grew quickly, until we had to leave it to go on a mission. 
---
Further down the line, the puppy appears again, only now it's 8ft tall, built to shit and talks, because the DM though it would be cool to have the dog from Final Fantasy or some shit, so he decided my path for me, decided what I thought would be cool and took my little puppy I won at a fair away to give me something he'd deemed was cooler.
---
Basically, retail feels like it's written by that DM. You have no choice in what you want to do, and you certainly don't have a choice in whether what you do is deemed 'cool' or 'epic' or not. You get what the writers think are good, and that's that.
---
I'm just glad to go back to being able to do the dumb simple shit I want to do
---
Oh my god, i forgot about that addon! Thanks &lt;3
---
I arrived home at 5pm and couldn't play till 21:30, today I'm prepared... I left the computer on with TeamViewer ready, I will log 3 hours before I get home.
---
They do not for spellcasters.
---
Well exactly. As someone who has been "stuck" on low pop servers for years, I don't want a repeat of that. Especially as I plan on investing a lot of time into Classic.
---
I've seen 39 on alliance Stalagg
---
As caster they don't
---
lmfao this is so true, the first bandit guy in Northshire Abbey was like that.
---
Is there an addon for WoW Classic that shows Enemy Numeric Values? I have it toggled in the settings but it only shows mine
---
Only 1 person mentioned the #1 class? Warlock is the best wPvP class. Warlocks win nearly every duel tournament even with SL being banned. Then it's Mage and Rogue.
---
This is why you roll on Stonespine and have fun. (or any other medium realm for that matter) realms are full pop the same as gehennas
---
Logged in this morning and got straight in. Went to make breakfast.
---
3 hour queue. FML.
---
No queue atm
---
Come join Ashbringer if you’re tired of endless queues!
---
I actually worked on the Blasted Lands portal back in 2002. So I was the actual first person there. Bitch
---
There really isn't many buffs anymore in retail. At least nothing besides the Priest, Mage and Paladin.
---
Except none of that would have happened if you could actually kill the boars.
---
In other words, your story has nothing to do with what game it is, only with the overpopulation it experiences on launch day.
---
Imagine waiting 4 hours to play a game
---
6200 isn’t bad.
---
Yeah, try going low pop.
---
Not at all and no one is encouraging people to do this.  But it's certainly a feat of strength that deserves a little recognition, in my opinion.
---
I can't imagine a world in which I pay for a transfer of my 1 or 2 day old character.   
---
Just make a new one on the new realm?
---
That must be it! It would be the most logical explanation if it only attacks if he ctrl+4 s, which is manually casting the firebolt.
---
He must have accidentally turned it off.
---
Imagine after 1 year.
---
Actual conversation with co-worker:
---
"How do you do screenshots?"
---
"Hit Print Screen"
---
"But I want a screenshot, I don't want to print it out"
---
omfgwtfbbqlol
---
I think Blizzard knows this as well. People will move to low pop and then just cough up the money later on. They are deliberately not providing any info on this topic and I think that's quite unfortunate. Out of principle, I simply refuse to pay the money for a transfer due to Blizz being incompetent.
---
Well damn I wasn’t expecting vanilla WoW to be an idle clicker
---
Wtf server's are busy on release day? Wow good job blizzard 😠😠😠😠
---
^^^^/s
---
yeah, what i really don't like is when people start pulling me on their RP while I'm just minding my own business and then yelling when i just don't play along.
---
Deal with it people, WoW is not designed to support RP. If you play RP in WoW you should spend your time better by playing in some RP online community/chat or find a D20 group.
---
Same problem. Same solution.
---
There \_SHOULD\_ be a grace period but alot of people are saying it isnt working.
---
I would NOT logout on the "old" pc first.
---
Try just logging directly in on your laptop,without logging out on your desktop, this will force logout your desktop. Hopefully keeping you outside of queue.
---
While this is a reasonable response and explanation, could you please comment on the concerns regarding how multiboxers affect the economy? With classic just launching, I think it's fairly rational to fear the effects this might have on a fledgling auction house. I'm ignorant to many of your practices and my only experiences have been getting killed in open world pvp by multiboxers. 
---
As primarily a PVP-oriented player I've only been exposed to the obnoxious, toxic behavior of multiboxers when they open up a giant silo of frostbolts/lava bursts/etc at me, instantly killing me. In my mind, this kind of activity ought to be completely bannable and against ToS, as it functions no differently than a cheating mechanism whereby one player can double, quadruple, or 21x their effective power. I'm sure there are a lot of nuances with boxing like gearing each character, etc, and that there's a lot I don't understand, but I really wish, for the sake of the community, that people were only allowed to control one character at a time.   
---
Trying to be respectful, and I hope it seems that way. Could you answer the question with regards to the economy, and the ones below?  
---
* Is there a general "culture" among multiboxers that shames those who engage in unfair PVP?
---
* Have you ever received any form of positive reception (in-game or otherwise) when people notice you multiboxing? Especially with such a large number of characters?
---
* Why do you do this? Is there anything particularly enjoyable about playing 21 characters, versus playing one? It seems like an enormous hassle to go through paying for each account, and I have no idea how you can spend the time on such an endeavor unless you work in CS or you game professionally.
---
* Is there anything that would convince you to do the same on other games, like FFXIV for example? Or is multiboxing primarily a tradition within WoW?  
---
If you take the time to answer these it'd be much appreciated, and I hope it doesn't seem like I'm crusading. If you'd like to discuss this with me directly I can be found on [Twitch.tv/Svallar](https://Twitch.tv/Svallar)
---
Thanks!
---
Join ashbringer for your moderately populated experience. Launched yesterday and seems good so far!
---
No because friends of mine are playing there and I want to play with them... Playing on another realm would just burn my time and no fun... Basically I have to wait until it´s emptier.
---
Lazy people using the app. I don't do it, but I can relate.
---
Estimated time: 420 minutes.
---
Piefke is a slur Austrians use for Germans. Its not that bad but good enough to trigger them.
---
Cant confirm but for example i was in que when internet dropped and 4 minutes late, i was back in que (mine, not at the end) .... So probably if u disconect internet (forced) shouldnt be problmes buuut cant confirm sorry
---
You need an addon to calculate and store mob health values, like "RealMobHealth"
---
I dont see an option to track nodes... help?
---
That's literally what layering is doing already. Just behind the scenes. I'm willing to bet that servers atm accommodate over 20k people. (probably 5-10 layers per server, adapting)
---
I premade my character there, therefore fate decided I shall wait
---
you do know you have a print screen ?
---
You definitely down rank as a pally. Keep ppl topped off with out over healing. You have to do this on long fights until you have solid gear, and even then some fights still require it. In world play/leveling you will drink less if you don't overheal.
---
I dont have a queue on my realm and it is medium now.
---
They changed it just a few moments ago, maybe try again?
---
This is so stupid, and you are really making the point for the other side.
---
Make a post like this again in 6 weeks and see what's left. (Which you won't as we all know there won't be anything like this activity on the servers by then) Having people log in during the Hype is irrelevant.
---
I'm playing for the first time. Spent an hour yesterday exploring Ogrimmar, going into every single building, checking out mostly every single NPC. Man that thing is huge. It really *feels* like a capital city. And to think that this is 15 years old.
---
Someone get this guy his neighborhood watch badge.
---
&gt;She asks me why we have to kill them and what they did to merit that
---
"read the fucking quest text noob"
---
Me and mah friends settled on deviant delight
---
We're having a blast so far
---
All it takes is a program and a few clicks. It makes your battery last longer too, because your cpu uses less power. It's a handy tool I never even knew about. My gaming laptops always got too hot, but with this 9th gen i5 and that xtu program undervolting, my laptop now runs cooler than my desktop did. Lol. It makes such a huge difference. The fans on this laptop are strong and not hearing them turn on full speed every 5 or 10 minutes is great.
---
Agreed. I had an amazing name on Herod. Like the absolute dream name. Was in the same mentality as OP till last night. Really wanted to play on a top realm. Till I realized that these new servers are more than likely going to stay high pop (in relation to the server size itself 20-30k players).
---
I'm not saying tear down and start again. But they could definitely up the base difficulties in many area. Focus more on communities etc. Make loot harder to get and therefore more rewarding.
---
/u/azurevott
---
1 channel for me on horde durotar was just “liberals suck, build the wall” “fuck liberals and Mexicans.” “I hate me some n*****s” “I hate liberals TRUMP 2020” bullshit spam.
---
LOL, i just posted a screenshot of a line for the same mob from Day 1.
---
Getting destroyed by a level 10 twink in WSG is much more humuliating than simply getting killed by a level 19 twink.
---
Can confirm too. Did this multiple times yesterday
---
You could try to grab your desired name on one of the new created servers.
---
I ran in that bitch lvl 5 straight to stormwind
---
Yea. I only had 40 minute queue as I got home from work. It got into multiple hours bit later. Benefit of living in a time zone that is bit ahead of the average european country. Got to level 10.
---
BuT whAT hApPEns WHeN tHe rETaiL TouRiSts leaVE???!
---
It looks gorgeous on max.
---
I feel with you. However, do not underestimate the amount of "foresight" they actually have done. I know you're upset and all that, but try to see what they actually managed to prepare for. Its pretty amazing if one can understand the technical and logistical challenges associated with this release.
---
Also different wifi swapping is in the grace period
---
Even at 60 you need 15 points in prot at most.
---
I've only played for 4 hours yesterday, and I'm currently sitting in a ~2 hour queue, but everything in classic feels more important. The world isn't just a theme park but a place to meet new people and make friends while having fun. Something I haven't seen in wow since TBC really. Not to this level.
---
Better than wod though
---
Yesterday it was 20k, but I couldn’t keep my laptop in network for 10+ hours so I lost my line. 6k was a happy surprise
---
My name isn't special at all. But try and understand my point. The logic of Blizzard having a special name reservation event two weeks before launch and now this total shitshow and chaos, and them telling people to move servers - it's like, why have that reservation period at all? Totally pointless.
---
And you say it's not a gamble being on medium population. You're most likely correct. But you can't say that 100% in 4-5 months there won't be population issues. It's unlikely, but you're not guaranteed. And that for me simply isn't worth it. If blizz gave more info on transfers then that's a different story.
---
It was mildly annoying at the very start but past level 7 or so I haven't ran into too many Bunches of other players thinning the mob herds
---
Not only is this unhealthy, but also dangerous – sitting for prolonged periods of time may cause blood clots to form in your deep veins.
---
Not only that, but prolonged sleep deprivation is also not recommended, like, at all. Even if you think you're fine, you're not – and you can't really "pay back" sleep debt. And when he finally goes to sleep, he is going to sleep far longer than he'd do under normal circumstances, meaning that in the end, it would be just fine to go to sleep normally, wake up and go back to playing.
---
All for 3600 viewers and a number in a video game.
---
So... inform me ?
---
Literally the only good thing, I can never play with my friends because of nightshift....it’s rough, we need our own community
---
You get a pet at level10 that will keep the mobs attention for you :)
---
It's considerably different, and there have been events that HAVE refunded for lack of adequate service and resources for the event being run, I could just about compare this launch to fyre festival if I want to be petty and make your point completely moot...
---
\[UPDATE\] HE MADE IT AFTER 9 HOURS! [https://i.imgur.com/UAhzfWm.png](https://i.imgur.com/UAhzfWm.png)
---
yep, world pvp is my favorite part or wow and flying mounts imo are the worst thing to happen to wow, so i’m not a fan of any version of the game besides vanilla. 
---
to be fair though, i like all forms of world pvp. i love pocket healing a warrior with wf totem down and going 2v5 but i also get a kick out of killing lowbies im stv with a fishing pole until they bring lvl 60s. i just like pking people in general
---
*laughs in stonespine*
---
Yeah this was from yesterday, maybe we were in line together!
---
Rofl - as shaman player can confirm this is pretty accurate.
---
I mean he said that 6 years ago and he was the dude that announced classic at blizzcon in 2017 so I think it's fairly safe to assume that he's changed his mind.
---
Could have figured that out myself, my bad. Thanks for the answer :)
---
I started in a new server. But in general chat everyone is just saying that the server will be dead next week, dont waste hours here, its just temp server until the real one are less crowded. It really kills the excitement for a new player.
---
Just buy blizzard balance cards. Most stores with gift cards should sell them.
---
Yes RP  servers like argent dawn eu and moonguard are two of the biggest servers in retail
---
Rogue hunter hybrid Druid and then lock. 
---
The first three will lock you down. And usually will escape you without much of an issue. Except a escape a hunter is fairly difficult. 
---
I play a hybrid Druid for world PvP and can tell you you don’t lose many 1v1s. And you’re such a good group player due to your ability to stealth/track pick your targets and lock enemies down / pocket heal your squad. You have the most tools of any class.
---
You now more reliably know what realm to switch to if you want to switch realms.
---
To be fair, your (or atleast my) character in retail started as nobody aswell. But after all those years he fucking deserve some recognition, I helped slay Kael'thas, been part of the group that killed Arthas, assisted Thrall with destroying Deathwing, fought corrupted Garrosh and liberated Orgrimmar, went back to past to kill Archimonde and many more heroic deeds. It's only natural that after all those years you've become Champion of your faction and i kinda like it, from that nobody who started as one of the few remaining Night Elves to someone who fought hard to become who he is. 
---
If there's still something about retail that i like, it's its storytelling. In vanilla story was almost nonexistent so you were just some random adventurer who does all those small tasks for random people. Yeah sure, it's kinda refreshing to be that poor nobody again but I really like both versions of my character.
---
Mograine (Eu).
---
Unfortunately they can be worn down after awhile.
---
Eh let them waste money. I really think that’s the best policy against these retail drones. Help and explain when they ask (politely), otherwise let them sink or swim.
---
Are you sure? I remember Xperl showing exact hp value. And Zperl is just a copy of Xperl?
---
Except dynamic respawning existed in vanilla.
---
I think it is just more noticeable in the very packed starting zones, I assure you the ballet and groups of people waiting for quest mobs to respawn are there ;)
---
I think it should be more something like this
---
&gt;server.serverStatus = "Full";
---
I’m also on Zandalar, getting in on a RP server (pvp or not) just filters out allot of the nasties it seems. I may have found a realm I can call home.
---
Ps. I’m Alliance so I guess that means I hate you now.
---
Yes it's worthwhile for sure. I just level my professions whenever I need a break from questing. Just put on some good music and make a couple of rounds around the zone and gather stuff. I try to make sure, if possible, that my gathering professions are up to speed before I leave a zone. In vanilla, the best gathering profession I ever did was skinning. Made me lots of money on my way to 60 (I just sold all the leather on the AH).
---
There is a guy on nethergarde keep called 'Ballista', he was 35 at 11pm GMT last night, may be worth adding to your list
---
i guess youre right
---
&gt;Nope, servers were clear from 7-10 eastern standard. If you weren’t on your shit after the reset at 10 EST, you were in a 3-4K queue, on Herod anyways.
---
Empty realms is a relatively straightforward problem to solve. Having a million paying customer who can't use the service is not.
---
I do think Classic leads to socialization a lot more than retail, but a lot of it is player attitude as well. It is both things.
---
Yes but they’re easily able to be escaped from. Mage isn’t that great of a world PvP class unfortunately. When focused they’re pretty much toast if ice block is down.
---
You might not, but others will, and if you're on a full server it'll make a difference
---
I think it’s Grid(?) and i think they do have it for classic but if not they have healbot
---
This is Gold :&gt;
---
Update: Even with my housemate's help, I'm still in a 4k queue....that hasn't moved for 20 minutes
---
that is silly!
---
Blizzard made bad decisions and they knew it as soon as they opened up name registration. They acknowledged using their most conservative estimates in creating servers initially and they acknowledged the need for more and their capability of having started with many more but choosing not to.
---
You got less exp for more work. Why brag
---
I believe that’s Luna unit frames
---
The consul command doesn't work because its in the options now under "interface &gt; camera &gt; max camera distance."
---
&gt;point completely moot...
---
No, because there's one big caveat to Fyre/Disney/Cons: the attractions inside aren't equal.
---
Here, absolutely every realm and world is **100% the same.**  You're blaming the fact that you couldn't coordinate with your friends on Blizzard.
---
these are amazin hahahaha, good work
---
That will have been a layer crashing
---
Yeah people waiting until you die near elite npcs so they can steal it from you really enhance the experience :D
---
well the Queue should jump in place when your Server hits the Full Label, all i said was with the old way before the update you could experience Queues even tho your Server falsly showed medium or high
---
To be honest, I love the idea of waiting a little bit. It adds to the suspense and it reminds me of Lineage 2, when I used to play it as a kid with my father. I’m looking forward to seeing villages, towns and farm areas full of players fucking around cause there are no mobs to kill
---
Really? Never had any issues with TeamViewer and it works amazing even in enterprise environments with hundreds of devices.
---
Yes, we get it.  Staying up for 30+ hours is bad for you.  I think that's pretty much common sense that everyone in the world can grasp.  You don't need to get on your soapbox and rattle your saber about it -- nobody will ever disagree, myself included.
---
But the marathon grinds are part of what made Classic so special.  Being able to really get in there and go hard is something that all of us normal folks have fantasized about.  I just wanted to call attention to probably one of the most extreme cases of no-lifing that I've ever seen.
---
Hell yeah! Before flying mounts, it was so fun to do glitches and try to get on top of things :D
---
Bingo. Amazing to see some people think WoW servers would be throttled by Bandwidth of all things.
---
In modern WoW its infinite is what he's saying
---
&gt;Warriors 
---
Level as fury or arms until 55 or 60. You really only need prot spec at the level 60 dungeons. Personally I'm going with 2h fury spec, then respecing arms at 40. It's a pretty common talent path and doesn't have any issues tanking the pre-60 dungeons.
---
Free yes, directed by blizzard. somtehing like a one-way ticket.  
---
Paid no, your charakter has an identity in classic wow. Don't mess around with that.
---
Whitemane had 2 hour queue at 8am mountain time.
---
wightfuwwy so! yuw know, I’m someding of a beaw ass expewt mysewf. wet me way down de basics of a pwistine beaw ass. It must be pwump but not gewatinous. It must be fiwm but not wock hawd. It must be fwagwant but not ovewpowewing. de butdowe must have a pewfect pentagwam shape which is incwedibwy wawe. dewe awe just so many pawametews dat make up what we scientists know as de pewfect beaw ass. uwu

 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
It's not all about the xp dude. Let the guy enjoy the game.
---
It will be in your spellbook in the general tab after you learn herb/mining
---
And you could still loot it even if it had no loot drop? That happened to me allot.
---
Can you help me there – so you are saying that the problem is their general bandwidth? Doesn't it mean that they can just add layers instead of servers then, cause that would be similar BW?
---
I mean, sure, some people might get annoyed but ultimately the idea behind "layers=bad" thinking is that pvp will be avoidable which is not the case if each of your layers has more population than old school servers.
---
Yeh that's so weird to me. I start playing the game when I hit Enter World. Just imagine playing through all that fucking content seeing it as just a long and laborious character creation.
---
We are playing from China, HK, and SEA on Arugal. But on Horde. We have a wechat group please feel free to join us.
---
Fixed values for enemies wasnt known in vanilla, only your own and party members had fixed values. Enemy value was calculated so it wasnt 100% correct.
---
Probably wasnt even for them they were probably asisstants
---
you mean like 5 min because of rezz debuff? Just walk and grind some mobs on the way.
---
The fact that you think the person is bragging about this is hilarious.
---
They're $25. $25 is enough to avoid paying if you don't have to, I'd say.
---
HW represent! I'm loving the community we are building there already :)
---
That orange lvl defias pillager could be alone and your chance of dying would still be 100% lmao
---
lmao :D
---
Sure? No. But it worked for me.
---
I had this problem too
---
I'm very curious to see whether or how quickly these queues drop off. Blizz clearly underestimated the popularity of Classic by an order of magnitude, or at least they did for launch. I'll be keen to see what kind of queues there are after a few days, weeks or months.
---
Awesome! I remember how much time I spent doing glitches and getting on top of things in SW. It's gonna be like the old days when you ask someone: How the hell did you get up there? :D
---
I understood the point but I was misinterpreting it on purpose.
---
That's what I suspected, but wanted to make sure before I make a mistake putting points somewhere. Thank you.
---
 *"Where I lay my head is home. See that rock? That's my pillow."*

Perfect, thank you!
---
I usually come home from work and other activities between 6pm and 7pm on daily basis... I log queue, even medium populated servers had 10k queue... jesus christ. Today I am going from work on my lunch break to log into queue.... Tried Teamviewer but the internet at work is not good enough to connect it.
---
Yea, but thats riding on the assumption that the prices will go back to what they were pre-classic (assumin you mean to resell, and not just buy and use.). There is a chance that with the playerbase losing a big chunk of active people, prices will just go to the floor ever more than right now, and only come back up halfway.
---
Buying shit up in bulk during a pricefall is always a double-edged sword, could result in big profit, could result in a bunch of shit you can not sell ever again. I currently can't even tell if my realm has enough people at high end raiding to keep crafting raid food and flasks worth it. Anchroweed went from 180 gold a piece to 107 gold, and its still dropping. Some lunatic is selling EVERY greater flask in full stacks at 80% of crafting price ATM. Like 2 pages of the AH is just him. Famine evaluator is a crafting cost + 2% gold.
---
I'm basically just leveling another character to 120, and I'll probably buy a stack of greater flasks each for personal use, since this one is gonna be a raid tank / dungeon tank. I might go and pull up an LF drenai warrior on top of my LF drenai prot pala, honestly, because farming right now is just a net waste of time, but you also can't really make any money buying shit up. I might honestly find people to boost players trought mythic 10 or something, since I have 2 toons that can do mythic 10+ content well, and I'm pretty sure gearing out the tank won't take long, since there is a tank draught in retail right now, even more so than before.
---
Lasted longer than BFA, that's for sure...
---
How is anyone supposed to be able to answer that? Pay up and give it a try, or don't. Only you can know if you like it or not.
---
It looks more 2004, but I laugh at the though of somebody taking a picture on there digital camera, taking out the sd card, loading on to windows xp and uploading that way back in 2004.
---
Many people are on servers with friends. Even if their character isn't worth 5 hours, their friends are.
---
In the past when that has happened, the person who had the oldest character got to keep it.
---
Yeah it would suck if you had to change your name, I get it, but if the price to get shorter queues is that some people might have to change names later, then I think that's a fairly low price to pay.

---
You could just pick another server?
---
I don't know about Vuhdo but if you have to type in spell names and want to use a lower rank it works like this:
---
"Healing Touch(Rank 3)" instead of "Healing Touch"
---
The important thing here is that there's no space between the spell-name and the brackets.
---
Rejuvenation(Rank1) 
---
If you don’t add the rank part it’ll do the highest you can. Change to whatever rank you want
---
Jesus, so more than a month of subscription to do something that's long automated by this point.  
---
Blizzard sure likes their money.
---
They can be bought from a NPC for 5 silver.
---
I'm starting to think he was right. Former rank 13 player here.
---
It's fun but its not the same.  Running around waiting for knoll respawns isn't hard nor is it fun.
---
It would be pretty disgusting, yet lucrative move, to introduce the...
---
#PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION FOR $19.99 - QUEUE PRIORITIZING!
---
They just need to offer free realm transfers RIGHT NOW. I started on herod, couldn't log in later, rerolled onto a low pop server, that server became too full and I couldn't log on, rerolled again to a low pop server and that one is filling up too. I refuse to start over again so I just don't get to play.
---
It might have a space after rank
---
Krom ftw
---
Do you realise just how many daily active users WoW classic has right now?
---
So glad I get out of work late and play in the night. It’s dead when I get on
---
I played a retail since Legion pretty active and now started with Classic. I feel like I never touched WoW and have no fucking idea what to do. I'm somehow completely lost and at the same time I know what to do. It's super weird..
---
I think that eventually they make announce TBC realms, but what they should do is make a copy of the existing classic realms. This way people can continue playing classic if they really want to (on their chars) or they can continue their chars on TBC. Or both.
---
their friends are all going to be dealing with the same queue issues though...
---
I buy mark of the wild. I run around Aldrassil buffing whoever. I read thank you’s in yell chat. Such social connection in wow classic. XD
---
 No when you list a token you cannot enter your price. Blizzard guarantees a price for you. Then when your token gets bought by someone they also don't control how much they pay. Whether they pay more or less you get whatever Blizzard offered you when you made the listing.
---
I found two six-slot bags from two mobs I killed back-to-back. My girlfriend heard me squeal with excitement and asked wtf had happened. She didn't understand my giddiness.
---
well if you don't like it you can still also try out retail WoW on the same sub.  2 for 1.
---
HAAWWW! +20 atk pwr
---
Who would have thought that the WoW killer would be WoW itself
---
What? Its just a remote desktop? How would me playing on my computer trough another computer violate tos? :S
---
Even further back it's in WC3.
---
Took off work yesterday. Logged in 1h before launch. Had a 40mn queue.
---
Logged off to get some sleep.
---
Logged back in at 7:30 in the morning, 0 queue.
---
At 4p.m my guildies tried : 6h queue.
---
I had the whole day to play without any lag or deconnection. Awesome.
---
But now my guild wants to swap servers. I will certainly not. I invested a work day, hours of gameplay, got crazy lucky with the items and got Mazzranache as a pet. I WILL STAY.
---
(Sulfuron, FR)
---
That's not how it works, though. You can't just add another layer to a full server. Server capacity is still a factor.
---
Not really. In classic, your identity means something and you can make a name for yourself.
---
In retail you're just another overpowered stat-god who's gonna get ported to a different layer in 10 mins anyway...
---
Queue of Queuecraft!
---
Tell that to my friends who have taken 2 days off and are lvl 30+
---
Even if you level in grey gear you still three shot most mobs and just rampage through quests on retail. It's a completely different experience. Every class has heals, every class has almost everything.  
---
Not even gonna mention the rare/epic-showering you go through after LK content. Everything is easier, so it just becomes a shore.
---
Hell, blizzard could remove leveling from retail completely and most people wouldnt mind. It's just a m+/raiding simulator by now anyway.
---
If only they had given warnings before the server went live that there would be massive queues mmmm
---
I don’t think it’s the same crowd as retail tbh. Anecdotally, none of my guild (we still call ourselves a guild I suppose) plays retail - at all. However, there’s a group of maybe 15-20 of us who are just slamming classic.
---
Yeah I won't bet against that. Hopefully it won't be as crazy as the other ones. Shaz and Gehennas are completely unplayable atm.
---
sure, try to sue for theft then. I'll watch you and laugh a bit.
---
That’s a lot of nagas
---
If done right it's basically impossible to differentiate
---
But would 30/0/21 be even viable at all?
---
Yeah, was an easy decision for me and my pal since we only were level 6 at the time the latest server were released.
---
Probably not everything, but things close by?
---
I get that. I just don't understand why they did it, since picking a new realm would have been a great option for everyone.
---
Stagger step shots by strafing away between shots to get a couple more in on each mob. Life gets a lot easier after you have your pet too.
---
&gt; Private servers weren’t supported by Blizxard and A TON of people never even tried them.
---
This is a big thing. I really wanted to play Vanilla, installed a PServer client, played for a bit then realised that at some point, everything will be gone with nothing to show for it. Now Blizzard are supporting it, officially, and everything is saved, I feel much happier about putting time into it
---
Have been, and will. Although now I'm at work :(
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like queues, so we put a queue in your queue, so you can queue while you queue.

---
The only groups having trouble with dungeons are the ones that didn't buy updated skills and went in at the lowest possible levels.  No competent players are having issues with dungeons.
---
Ahmpy is 40, Leshraque is 38 half a bar from 39.
---
Did you pay for the Q skip subscription? Its a hidden option the blizzard website, changes place for everyone, have a look for that its only an extra £3.00 per month.
---
I didn't know grinding the same mobs for an hour because they can't drop an item is a definition of RPG. Classic have no more RPG elements than retail, it's just slowed down with lower drop rates and slower pace.
---
We've gone full 2005
---
shareholders &gt; people sadly
---
Yes, you just have to get there
---
But you literally tried to use that example as a reason for why blizzard should NOT reimburse for hours spent in queue to attempt to play with friends or log back into the character you've already invested 6 hours into...
---
Nice! Yeah I don't have any abilities as of yet, hope they'll come soon :)
---
Ayy I was apart of that, Ragingbow. Lol
---
Hows the respawn rate outside of starting zones? I get that fast respawns is the lesser evil of the two but man was it ridiculous in the Burning Legion cave, the pack you just killed literally respawned while you were killing the next one. Perhaps its only this bad in starting zones, especially the endgame content of that zone?
---
Yes that would have changed everything
---
May the queue’s be gentle on thou.
---
#amen
---
Oh wow, that's great actually, thanks!
---
It is also possible to have exceptions, and still maintain ownership. Such as donating stuff to museums for display.
---
There are certain video game museums and libraries where you can play games no longer accessible, but the publishers still retain their rights to the game.
---
Sweet, thanks
---
I think the fact that you're stuck on one server with these players and you will run into some of them again does a lot for it.
---
Yeah, sure. You just need to make your way there.
---
Don't need to change your mind, you can be ignorant and wrong all by  yourself in the corner.  
---
If you cared enough to learn about this, you wouldn't have come to that conclusion.  OR you're so ignorant you can't be reached.  Either way, helping you figure this out isn't worth anyone's time.
---
This is for 8.2 (retail). Doesn't work in Classic WoW
---
Yeah beautiful story. The personal details at the end really make this a great tiny story.
---
It really doesn't.
---
Man I get all that. One pvp server for oceanic was really stupid. That’s all there is to it.
---
Cool! I was worried I was doing something wrong lmao
---
Holy shit this is me all the time, I run after them when I'm out of range too lol also giving some heals to people fighting mobs to keep them safe. Love the "/y ty" and "/thanks" I get, makes me feel happy lol
---
nice
---
I remember saying to my friends "Guys! We will do it better this time. We will not make any noob mistakes like we did the first time we started. WE ARE SMART NOW!"
---
....we all made soooo many beginners' mistakes already.
---
* Forgetting to recast find nodes after death
---
* Forgetting to switch out rank 2 with rank 1 spells
---
* Forgetting first aid was a kind of crucial thing for any non-healer class
---
* Warri tank forgot he had to stance dance
---
* Mage forgot he had to have light feathers in order to cast slow fall
---
* We all had to look up where to train weapon skills
---
* As a tailor I had to figure out how to get past 75
---
* Forgot how to unlearn professions
---
* "Wait...is there a difference when logging out in a major city or logging out in a major citie's inn rested bonus wise?" 
---
So... even as a "vanilla elite" player it's kind of amazing how much you can forget. Let alone if you are a player that never played pre cata. It's almost like its a completely different game
---
Queues because of hordes of people migrating from pvp realms
---
We are still in the "think you do" phase. Give it at *least* a few months, but moreso a year, before you make fun of this quote. Seriously don't get how everyone can just circlejerk each other so hard because launch numbers are good.
---
In other news, i've been enjoying the game. Hope it keeps delivering!
---
that is journeywow
---
you didnt get the sarcasm... damn i am already tired of seeing this... but i will stay positive and not bash anyone for their expirience.... just please... limit the amount of things you post before yo actually check out how this subreddit works...  
---
I would really vote for a sticky topic for screenshots of queues on servers for quest items/mobs/bosses...  
---
\-\_-
---
tried taht and it wouldnt work with classic...at least not for me.
---
currently using pearl and dominos and it seems to have shifted everything slightly to the right, so its right on the edge of my big ass screen now
---
why would you spread this information xD
---
you're not one of us
---
I’ll start selling soon enough but for the start zone, it’s a sweet thing to do for others and I’m yet to meet someone who isn’t stoked.
---
Well there’s no ques right now
---
Run to the Zeppelin tower at UC and you can fly to org, from there you can run to durotar and resume questing. Wouldn't recommend it though undead starting zone is nice and quiet.
---
Warrior, mage, rogue
---
Not the point man - why was one server ever expected to be enough. And why do we have to reroll because of it? 
---
It was a vent post - I’m not looking to solve the worlds problems here and nothing with change. But one server was fu***ng stupid
---
well mc epicks yeh, but bwl nope. Also Naxx gear wasnt replaced till level 70
---
I made a character on an RP server guess i'm an RPer now.
---
As a shaman player let me say that enhancement shamans are the most easily kiteable class/specc in the game. Good players will abuse that massively. So vs good players you will struggle

---
Are they mega sized in retail?
---
If you're more limited when it comes to time than money, it's not a hard choice to move a lvl 10.
---
The main demographic for this are in their 30s, so I think a lot of people would use it. Myself included.
---
you have to buy abilities from a hunter trainer.
---
Which are obviously a superior siege weapon, because they can throw a 90 kilogram projectile over 300 meters.
---
Ying and Yang dude. There is a balance to everything, even in Azeroth.
---
Queued for 8,5 hours yesterday, will be worth it one month from now to get to play with all your friends and be on a server where shit happens, but right now it sucks. Hop on queue and sleep a few more hours or teamviewer the queue from work
---
Crackers. I did a deal on Linen Bags, 3s each or x4 for 10s.
---
Sold a ton in Goldshire.

Deal of the century!

Defias Pillager aka the first mob to use pyroblast at level 15

---
I'm druid but I watch in awe how quickly warriors and mages kill stuff
---
Horde is meh. Iv been horse my entire wow careeer, since vanilla, but I’m going ally this time around. I think there leadership cast is cooler honestly when it boils down to the characters as individuals.
---
My experience so far has been very little foreign language in the global channels, on every 'English' server I visited. It doesn't seem like a problem at all.
---
Made a character on an RP server because the Q time went up to about 50 mins.
---
There's more zones with weather in BfA than there is in Classic. Probably five times as many zones.
---
... I literally died *three* times as a lvl 6 Hunter yesterday because *one* cougar was kicking my ass. And I even played in Vanilla. 
---
I think I just suck, and that other people just got better.
---
I'm on flamelash and haven't seen any other languages yet.
---
&gt; I can't remember the last time I said anything to even a raid group in retail.
---
Honestly, I feel like this is your own doing. Retail isn't as bad as you lot make it out to be, raid chats are constantly going on with raid advice and even LFR has it's qualities of random shit talking if you're into that.
---
You know how sick and ugly a community is when something completely normal like this makes it to the frontpage with 6,5k upvotes. In less toxic communities this is just....normal.
---
Oh no honey what is you doin!
---
I got one at Walmart
---
How can we accept this of Blizzard???
---
Warsong Gulch will be your revenge!
---
No shit they low balled the server numbers hard.
---
What do you think is going to happen when half the classic population leave is 6months?    
---
You either have 8 medium servers that have a healthy population and can sustain them selves    
---
or     
---
15 low pop servers that no one wants to play on because they're low pop
---
I had 60 min queue last night on Zandalari Tribe. Was not to bad.. But you have to expect queue. The ammount of concurrent players here are absolutely mindbogling
---
I am absolutely crazy for wow classic, I say yes!
---
If I had a printer, I'd take a picture with a phone, print it, then take another picture with a phone of it, just to riddicule the trend.
---
The fact that you have to use your characters life saving to learn skills really sets you up to making tough choices.

I've been on Zandalar Tribe, and I've been communicating normally in groups just because there isn't much time to mess around given how busy everywhere is. That said, when saying bye I always dip into character and wish people a safe journey and stuff. People seem to really appreciate it which is nice!
---
It's my first time on an RP server and I only went on it because the queue was short, so I think this slow dip into roleplaying is good for me. Having an absolute blast on it so far.
---
Shamans still have excellent carebear potential. You can heal people who've overpulled, res them when you see them die, AoE snare with Earthbind or distract with Stoneclaw when you see someone running for their lives from a pack, give people water walking or breathing when you see them on a quest that requires crossing water or diving. Later on in dungeons people will love your buffs and when you save them from graveyard runs with Reincarnation.
---
NSFW
---
Yea that was nice. I started leveling a little before reset. Loads of people, but no queue or anything. Had a blast. Grob Mob for life
---
Druids are probably the least played class so my uniqueness and flag carrying will shine later haha
---
I've read something from a support and he said you can speak any language in chat. The only thing that matters is you can't speak any offensive language in any language. 
---
If the server if English it means that the support language is English for the realm, nothing else.
---
Disclaimer: I never speak my own language in public chat.
---
suck it up boomer
---
I qued for 5 hours in the morning yesterday got in 5 minutes later got dced and ended up in a que for 7 hours.
---
Didn't see you out there\~  ;3
---
what happens after they release naxx though. Like will they go same path with tbc &gt; wotlk ( which i wouldnt mind as wotlk was actually my favourite part of the game) but then it will just be a cycle. Maybe they will decide to release new content which we have never seen before.
---
Yeah but when i was a kid i had all the time in the world, didn't have chores, a job, hygiene... Now it's different, while I have money to pay a sub, I don't have the time I used to.
---
Yeah I though about joining Ashbringer. Great to hear that it seems fine.
---
What do you actually do different on a RP Realm? I guess no memeing and being more "In Character"?
---
Didn't know there's an app of it, will try ir
---
IM really not a fan of gloomy undead zone. Its very thematic sure, but my spirit yearns for the open plains of mulgore or the harsh deserts of durotar/barrens. Never was a fan of Tirisfal/Silverpine because of how dark it is.
---
That said, im still leveling there. As a troll. Because i want myself that sexy undead horse :D
---
Will try it out thanks
---
Imo Undead is one of the worst zones. I guess it has a kinda cool atmosphere, but the quests are pretty bad.
---
For me Teldrassil has always been and always will be no. 1, and I think it's fastest as well if done optimally
---
I loved wotlk. The dungeons were awesome and the raid to kill the lich king was so fun
---
I don't know a lot about shamans and when they get their powerful abilities, but i remember they can solo higher level mobs whit rockbitter and the dmg reduction totem
---
You want to go a shadow level spec and pay the gold at 60 instead. As pointed out, a wand is your best friend. You will still be able to heal in low level instances.
---
Honestly, it depends on what you want.
---
Classic is fun for those of us who have played a lot of WoW and are kinda sick of the retail version, etc. But if you've played other MMOs you may not like it. Most 'rotations' are one button rotations for most of leveling. There is *a lot* of running back and forwards to do quests. Dying is a real pain because there's not many graveyards so more running. Gameplay is slow, but methodical. It's good - there's a real fun sense of progression as you level up. But just know compared to modern MMO's everything is way slowed down.
---
Depends on the kind of PvP.
---
There's vast differences between 1v1 duels, open-world, Warsong and Alterac.
---
There's also strong synergies between classes, that alone aren't super-great but become much stronger when combined.
---
If we think about 1v1 world-pvp I'd say Shaman, Hunter and Warlock might be really strong. But also Rogue and Druid thanks to stealth and the ability to surprise. And Shadow-priests of course due to their ability to proc stuns that completely mess up whatever you do and their strong defenses. Mages are also really good against a lot of classes. Basically everything except warrior and Paladin is pretty good in that scenario. But the combination of Warrior and Paladin becomes super good because they completely cancel out each others weaknesses (Warrior is very susceptible to CCs and Slows but Paladin can remove all sorts of CCs, Paladin has no gap-closers, no slow, no interrupt and his CC has very long CD but Warrior provides spammable slow, great gap-closers and an interrupt)
---
&lt;3 love that song, it goes well with this release.
---
It's not though. It's completely unnecessary. Remote desktop, helloooo?
---
When did dungeon finder come into wow originally? Will they introduce this again at a later date?
---
Mulgore &gt; all
---
Druids get aquatic form - indefinite water breathing and 50% speed increase in the form.
---
Much better than a +200% breath timer or a 10 min water breathing buff.
---
Pull with smite or mind blast, put up a SW:P and then wand away. You might want to shield yourself before pull or put up a renew between pulls. My tip is choosing improved wand before spirit tap since early wands do so much damage that you keep spells to a minimum.
---
I once knew a level 60 paladin who'd never done the quest to learn resurrection.
---
Yeah I just made a new character on Yojamba, I'll go back to Arugal when it all calms down I suppose. Yojamba is poppin too though, there's like 50 people around every quest boss so far
---
My guild is named &lt;Rain Boots&gt;, a sort of inside joke, but also a nod to the weather effects of classic we’ve waited so long for.
---
I know I didn't use to automatically keep track of mana and time efficiency of all actions I take in combat back when I played wow before in the same way I do now.
---
Players farming mobs into the ground also gives one a lot more room for both fighting and recovering.
---
Each time your pet dies, you must feed him to get him happy and get the damage bonus. Other than this situation, it takes quite a lot of time before you need to feed it. You also must feed him after you stayed afk with it by your side in towns/inns
---
The key is to always buy food for your pet when you restock your arrows/bullets. And you should also bring food close to its level for better efficiency.
---
And to think that humans are getting reputation bonuses.. Well I guess they need it more
---
hey guys so about this Iraq thing lmaooo
---
jeez dude if you're on herod/whitemane i'd just switch off....or find the lowest pop server and realm switch when the game dies down.
---
Depends how often it dies, but if your pet can eat fish, you can easily keep feeding him by fishing once in a while.
---
There is an addon called "Whelp". I think thats the closest thing to what youre looking for.
---
my parents didn't even know I played wow lol, it didn't affect my school productivity at all since I wasn't very productive to begin with
---
like most people : because it's easier and lazier. the less effort it takes, the better. and then we end up 20years later with lazy games which are less interesting than 20yo games.
---
Those lines aren't as long as it looks, 5 people can do the quest at once if the are in group.
---
Lmao you people act like the world is ending because you can't get into a server on THE most anticipated MMO relaunch in the last two decades.
---
Holy fuck. Literally wait a week.
---
Didn't downvote you and I don't know why you downrank. But my friend who has the highest healing (not only pally healing) logs in Naxx across all private servers downranks his heals. I know this because he got pretty mad at some pally who got oom super fast on Patchwerk when he was still at over 90% mana and doing more healing than him.
---
So like Retail.
---
That's ridiculous
---
\+1 for taking comments out of context...
---
ion was talking about long term, no one, not even blizzard ever denied the fact that there will be an onslaught of ppl in the short term, its just like with any other expansions, at launch the demand sky rockets and then it slowly 'normalizes' which will hit classic even harder i think because there wont be any surprise content drops, we know everything that will come and we know when (roughly). i still remember the content drought from wod which is gonna be the same in classic.... just perpetualy and in warlords there where alot of things to do while you waited for actual content, from pet battles to achievement farming during the drought you still had something to do, which you wont have in classic AND in wod you knew that sooner or later there would be new content again which you know wont happen in classic.
---
.. Oh
---
What the game was and should have always been. Yet what it's become is... sad.
---
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but wasnt the whole layering thing supposed to make it so that more people could be on one realm without making it shitty? Partially help to reduce the queue times as well? I thought the whole point of layering was to alleviate queue times.
---
Yeah, but the servers also hold 10x the players now.
---
No one knows. There could be progression servers or it could just be reset, or just left alone.
---
usb steering wheel.
---
It's just a field!
---
&gt; Spanish is the 4th most spoken language in the world 
---
So what? If there are not enough players to make special realms it means no shit. A special realm also means same language support same language forums and so on and so forth.
---
They're set to the "CLASSIC" preset by default, atleast they were for me.
---
Since OP is unaware how melee kites. Mobs swing twice for every time you do (2:1). After your auto attack, back up/strafe and only engage when auto attack cooldown is ready. This way you reduce the mobs attacks to match your own (1:1). You HALVE your incoming damage. It's a little dance (do a circle to avoid adds and leash range) and harder than other classes, especially when dealing with adds, but you can at least solo things.
---
Tell me about the dwarf starter, i never leveled there. but im curious

I'm guessing he asked because 4 months later I still can't find the answer to what he's asking either. Be nicer.
---
Yeah. I wish it didnt cost so much mana though.
---
Can I send the pet away when I go afk and recall him to save feeding? I´m super worried I have to farm food all day long to keep the pet I want xD
---
That could definitely be true. I do get a little suspicious when a complicated problem has such a simple solution, though.   
---
"a lot of people quit, the servers will still have a vanilla-like population"   
---
what does "a lot of people" mean? At what point does the number of people quitting cause us to end up with less people than in vanilla servers. all these wow players and community members that are confident that we will have so much player retention. what do they base this feeling on? popularity of subreddits? density of memes? the general feel of the community on forums, youtube, and reddit? how can we as wow players have a good grasp on what the player retention will be like?  
---
are we ok with having vanilla-like populations on servers? the total population of wow-players has grown significantly since then. don't we prefer that the wow classic communities are richer and has way way MORE people than back in vanilla? 
---
this feels a little more complicated than you are implying
---
&gt; /console WeatherDensity 3
---
Where do I put this?
---
I've given it a bit of a thought, but I've gone to pyrewood village in the end.
---
&gt; why would a intelligent creature let you ride them?
---
Ahem... No idea, really.
---
And because what's cooler than killing warewolves and zombies all day :P
---
Don't worry so much though. Although it is a pain to do some quests with one mob spawn let's say, the rest is mostly very fluent and you always have people to group up for anything, which is in classic very useful.
---
Also, the  bottleneck quests can be easily skipped by grinding or dungeons.
---
Enjoy your first experience! :)
---
I’ll have a look!
---
A little note on the hand-in side. If you see a yellow marker on the mini map, thats normally your hand in (or herbs, maybe herbs).
---
As I believe he’s put the 1-60 speedrun on hiatus and is solely focusing on fixing his site, as he’s having an absolute nightmare with it. So he’s making that his #1 priority atm.
---
Once he’s sorted it, he will then be returning to his WR attempt of 1-60
---
Guys can you please not spam on general chat. My mom bought me this new laptop and I'm trying to level up my new character but it gets really hot when the chat is being spammed. Now my leg is starting to hurt because it is getting so hot. Please, if you don't want me to get burned, then dont spam the chat.
---
I had a queue to buy a sub, lol.
---
You could say that about most things in the game, if you think about it.
---
Welcome to Azeroth!

Enjoy your stay. :)

Mage or rogue for world pvp. Warriors do good too.

why would you ask that here, just check twitter or smth
---
It's pretty cool yeah, but it's just a big greenhouse. I like the colours.
---
Remember you can eat and drink at the same time too
---
Yeah I liked tbc because everyone has puny little griffins and then it was actually hard to get cooler flying mounts
---
Imagine if there weren't layers.
---
"Just play in low pop realms so you dont have to sit in queue"
---
/shrug 
---
I've been playing all night on a Medium pop server. With my friends because they got sick of the queues and moved, too. You just want to keep a name or something.
---
Relax lol
---
Druid or Disc Priest
---
Look into something like the Razer Tartarus og Logitech G13. They have thumb-controlled D-pads you can use for movement. I've had a Nostromo N52 since Vanilla and I love it!
---
I used to think priests sucked at levelling. Holy shock, smite, mind blast, SWP, shield and wand the rest. You rarely will need to drink and you can even kill large packs or elites when using fear etc. Good luck!
---
Don't forget to feed your pet, to keep ist Happy and ready.
---
Currently doing Night Elf and god damn I HATE the first 2 zones until you get to Ashenvale. And even when I reach Ashenvale level I'm planning on heading over to the human areas anyway...
---
Late WOTLK, most likely not
---
This is good
---
Yeah I'm on there. Played only a couple of hours last night but had a great time! No queue times but still enough people so you don't run around in an empty world beyond the noob-zones. Very friendly people, someone handed me a small bag out of the blue which was great.
---
I have only seen english being spoken on Ashbringer so far.
---
Same. Got to Stormwind this morning at level 7, thinking i could learn sword specilization ready for combat spec (rogue). Nope... Didnt have enough silver to learn it. Actually made me smile :)
---
I pulled a 14 hour day and dced about 6 times, no problems.  Friend of mine would barely make it an hour and not get in.  Strange stuff.
---
But clicking Enter World is one of my favourite things.
---
Because its hard to set up team viewer on your phone to check queue without need for additional device.
---
You need an epic mount for that though.
---
imagine if there werent queue times.
---
I thought it was funne ope have an updoot
---
Please remain in character when speaking of the RP server's.
---
I thought about trying out a character on Shaz because I knew there'd be a strong population but yeah. 4 hours in queue and it barely moving down and I gave up.
---
Chilling on Nethergarde now having 5 minute queues and no ganking worries.
---
Teamviewer from phone my friend.
---
I'm not sure about that. The Hillsbrad bear/spider/cougar quests still have a very low drop rate
---
Late WotLK. I think it was in patch where ICC raid was added to the game.
---
Is it obvious by his facial expression when he's taking a poop in his diapers?
---
can u check if a high has q?
---
Wait a week for the hype to die down and the casuals to quit.
---
Although I did give up my toons on Herod, cuz fuck that noise.
---
Ended up on a another (currently) full server. Queues can get high still, but I log on asap to avoid that. Lol
---
Just make a macro for all your spells xD
---
`#showtooltip`  
---
`/cast Smite`
---
Installed TeamViewer on my office PC, its 12AM here and will be at home at 7pm, so I expect to login by then currently 5k ppl queue.
---
Well, I got an 8 hour queue yesterday afternoon.
---
There is People that put themself in much more danger for much smaller benefits.
---
So meehhhhh
---
If he likes to and doesn't do this on a regular Basis at all. Then it should be not too bad.
---
Let's just hope he won't stay up much longer :)
---
No it's quite common. I prefer using strafe keys because it frees up your mouse in case you need to click on something, both work though
---
Depends on the addon I guess and what you're willing to lose. Questing addons will change your playing experience as you no longer are unsure where to go. Something like bag addon or portrait addon hardly changes anything for you.
---
God forbid you would ask other people for some information. I guess OP forgot that this place is only for posting large login queue memes
---
Need this for my Druid too.
---
["You think he died, but he didn't"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRWbIoIR04c)

free tailoring exp for him!
---
Def slower spawn rates as you get higher level.
---
I don’t know why people are flaming you, because this is genuinely helpful information.
---
It’s cutting out hassle for those who want to play the game, and that in itself is upvote worthy.
---
Thank you for this!
---
28 or 29 on Pagle
---
&gt;  and they are doing nothing to alleviate it
---
I mean they keep making more and more realms but people won't go on them .
---
If they made that available they wouldn't be able to pass off classic subs as BFA subs though
---
You must be rich to be able to spend silver on ress
---
Is it though, i thought Legion was prety popular?
---
I don’t think you do yet, keep em coming bois
---
Eh, it hasn’t been too pleasant for me. Lots of people ditching once they’re done with their own objectives, being generally rude, ghosting while their group kills, and an awful general chat (which is a given). 
---
There’s been perfectly decent interactions too, but on Herod Horde I’ve had a few bad ones here and there.
---
are there many ppl doing this? or do you have to remind them to start voice chat ?
---
This is exactly what OP has done too, his issue is once he takes a break and logs back in he has a queue again similar to his previous server. It's like blizzard is fighting a flood and adding an single additional glass after the previous glass they added is well over flowing
---
Glad to know you're enjoying the game.
---
I've reached level 8 in 2.5h with my hunter, but I've also started skinning/lw, though I'll prob switch to skinning/herbalism until I decide which to dump.
---
It really feels great, and the people are nice and they buff you (those that can).
---
The hold is a lie.
---
Due to layering. Each layer is still about the size of one vanilla server. And that number is pretty arbitrary as they've stated, they can increase or decrease the cap quite easily since it's all hosted in the AWS cloud.
---
Azeroth
---
This seems like a good idea, I'll wait for a more expert opinion too
---
None of them have any real kill potential.
---
Me and my friends spent an hour to kill the 20 harvest watchers.  We had to get some oil later because someone vendored it and this was 2 levels later and we were stomping them.  You feel the difference.
---
It's mostly about the fact that every time you implement a change, which may seem like an overwhelmingly positive one at the time, there will be unforeseen negatives side effects for doing so. Even something like a better mob tagging system, I'm not saying that would be a bad idea but I do wonder if that could change some of the social dynamics in a negative way. 
---
Blizzard just made a lot of minor, sometimes major changes and a number of them really hurt the game.
---
this is just my guess over the matter but blizzard has said they expect only 1/10 of people to stick around so with layering they allow for somthing like 8-10 times more players than a full server so that once these temp people leave the servers will be good.
---
with that say we can see that blizzard majorly under served the number of severs for name reservation on day one if the EU would have had 6 english pvp servers on day one the spread would have been so much better and in the end not an issue.
---
The best part is people chasing you down to buff you after you bugged them. So relentlessly nice lmao
---
Paladin has good survivability and heal. Resto druid has good surv, somewhat okay kill potential (with lot of dots, maybe feral form) but not really good heal, shaman has better kill potential. Priest has bad kill potential, but excellent healing and somewhat good surv.
---
we have no idea what the ratio is
---
even the census is small and outdated
---
Kargoz has a great guide for priest:

I have played a lot of hunter the pet food is a none issue, just buy 2 stacks of meat and get a cat.

Arugal is garbage. Remoted from work into my PC to get into que early. Managed to get into the server when 10mins away from home, walked in, disconnected. Now sitting at 5.7k.
---
Maybe ask in the retail subreddits?  Here you are like to find only trolls and happy fans
---
I like this comment
---
Dead servers ? Why are servers supposed to die ? When Vanilla first launched, the number of players kept growing and growing, and actually never went down (until Cataclysm btw), despite it being a very much “hyped” game that people came on just to test. Why do people suddenly assume 90% of the playerbase of Classic will disappear after a few months ? At this point even if more than half of the players left (assuming no new players would join), the servers would still be completely overloaded once layering is gone.
---
It hurts.
---
Big agree...don't let (((them))) divide us! (((They))) gain power from subverting us and our people.
---
aahha biggest meme of the server love it
---
Just let your sub run out at the end of the month. We’re better off without you.
---
Deadmines is DM.
---
&gt; even if you are really starved for time its still waste of money.

---
Ha joke on you all the start of most recent patch was the best time to get wow tokens I score enough to last me until christmas.
---
Different shard and 2 mins.
---
I just have my friend who is off work log in 6 hours before I get home from work XD that way I only have to wait 2 hours in queue before I get in! lifehacks!
---
I think depends on how many people will be playing at that moment.
---
How is everyone getting queues? Is it because I'm on a pvp rp server? First day I logged in at launch and played 9 hours no queue ever. Second day I had a 1 hour queue. Made myself breakfast and ate it and sat down and it was almost over logged off later then logged back in immediately so queue would go while I watched a movie and ate dinner. Queue went off before my movie was over so had to move myself every 5 or 10 minutes a couple times. No queue problems at all
---
How about a compromise?
---
Get Wand-Specialization, Spirit-Tap and the Talent that increases your Holy-Fire and Smite-Damage by 10%.
---
Sure it's not as fast as shadow but it's decent and in 5-mans you can actually benefit a lot from spirit-tap and wand-spec.
---
Yeah that's my only quam atm, don't want to get the game then not be able to play, especially as during thr week I have limited time to play lol
---
So, what's with extra space in first class? Because technically they don't need it, thus we should just have economy seats - as other people might need a seat.
---
i was pulling with mind blast and sw:p smite smite... all the fight . I have a lesser wand but i don't think it deals ''so much dmg'' Should i use wand more and kite ?
---
Are you in oceania or something? There are PvP and RP-PvP servers in North America that have not had queues all evening.
---
You complete all raids in one sitdown.
---
Rest of the week you jump around on the bankroof in ogrimar
---
I just tamed a new pet for next ranks of bite / claw. And for some reason I was able to name those two! I don't really get it. Maybe pets that were tamed during a specific time frame are bugged?
---
Deadmines is just DM.
---
Dire Maul is DMW or DME
---
When i realised it back in the day i rolled troll only for this:D

lmao
---
Just a quick question - how are you planning to make the money in Classic? I assume this was just for fun as you can't finance the game through Classic? Or can you?
---
Think many enjoy it a lot more than expected. For myself at least, the slower pace and the amount of (nice) players have really made it an enjoyable experience. This will of course die down a little, but it’s still an experience that’s hard to replicate.
---
At the moment, Classic actually feels more like a game, as in I relax when I play it, contrary to BFA where I feel like I have to do the all the weekly stuff, else I’m behind

After time phases movement will cease in the universe and everything will be perfectly still.

Real answer is we dont know

Good. I don’t want it I was just asking if it was being added.

You said mid Wotlk, but the peak was at the end. :D

Yeah, not important, I know.

Yeah I was thinking this... in 2004 i dont think I had a phone that could take photos... I screenshotted everything.

I'm leveling with my homie and he rolled warrior, he said he's so glad i can heal otherwise he'd be losing his mind
---
I doubt anyone's doing dire maul at the moment so just use DM.
---
I've never heard the acronym VC being used myself though.
---
now this is the real queue meta
---
When I played vanilla nobody at all called it VC. But whatever you use, whether it be DM or VC, everyone knows what you mean. Nobody is going to seriously think you're running around in Westfall looking for a group to Dire Maul. It's just become a thing where people can't resist discussing it to death.
---
Everyone talking about these elites and no one asking why you got no pants on
---
Beat me to it.
---
I think it was done so they weren't able to be blocked by players, which used to happen. Now anyone can click on them. I just translate it as being purely gameplay reasons, not lore reasons.

Same, went Nethergarde on the first day and it seems pretty chill with a good population.
---
It's really not that often. If you keep 2 stacks of food with you you're good.
---
During their loyalty gaining process, they need to be fed a lot more. Just when you've tamed it, for instance, you need to feed it 2 times at least. Once he becomes unruly (level2 loyalty, max is 6), you will need to feed it way less.
---
Have fun! It's awesome being a hunter! You can name your pets too.

\&gt; Imagine if they had created Classic servers right at BC launch. They would have been empty throughout (especially as BC and Wotlk were more successful than Vanilla). 
---
But they could have created classic servers like in 2015 and they would have been popular.
---
It’s not, but there is a noticeable difference in auction house prices  and sales. 
---
I think there’s a lot of people that forget that just because they like classic better that doesn’t mean EVERYONE does. 
---
I only get on to play the AH currently lol

Excellent! *pats elephant*
---
The problem is that you suffer spell push back when the mob hits you. That makes the wand do more DPS than smite. Try it out. Make sure you use the wand and instant casts when the mob hits you, that's the basic of it all.
---
no kiting usually. Just keep renew on yourself, power word shield as needed, and let the wand do the work. Make sure to put points in wand damage talent.
---
Until level 20 or so, a good wand actually outdamages most casters.
---
Here is a list of a lot of the better horde-side wands available, with levels, dps, and where to get them.

There was a reddit post today. Highest level guy is 40 right now.

This is just silly, retail has weather effects. Like, knock on retail all you like but you can't really pretend the world and atmosphere aren't fantastic. If WoDs environments were in vanilla WoW people would have gone nuts for it.
---
 Blaumeux had a 4k queue thats like 60 mins max
---
Last 10 years I was on horde 
---
This time just as I was in classic back in 2004 I am Alliance. It is weird to say after playing so long with horde but in classic it is definitely “For the Alliance!”
---
Takes a while to get high spell crit btw, just saying.
---
What ? Never has that. Sometimes when I input too many things it can freeze wow. But that's kind of expected when using a software NOT made for that to "play" games.
---
Yeah, after yesterday's grind i'm going to have to disagree with this.
---
another QWE user!

asd binds are the win

*\*respect to you\**
---
Atmosphere-wise it was the peak of Blizzard. And, as I mained a priest, the class reforms introduced then were also fantastic. Disc became a very good single-target healing spec (where we use to be outclassed by paladins), and holy was amended to be the raid-wide healing spec (letting us compete with resto druids). And Shadow remained it's own, which was fine to begin with.
---
And the creativity in raid content was huge. You'd go from the classic vanilla experience for Naxx, over the wonky mechanics in Ulduar and the randomness of the tourney, and end up in the streamlined experience that was ICC, with fights that were designed to put every single raid member to the test individually.
---
And the buildup to these raids was fantastic as well, with the 5 man content for both Ulduar and ICC as stand-out experiences (the tribunal of ages from HoS comes to mind, as well as being chased by the lich king in HoR were particularly memorable)
---

Jump on the cannon at VanCleef and tell your groupies to not touch the adds. Your heals will aggro the adds abd they will go "evade". Kill the boss and when youre ready, jump back to the ship (maybe bubble to lose aggro) and deal with the adds.
---
Is it true that all the top players currently also happen to be streamers? You'd think there are some unknowns with less distractions out there keeping up.
---
Yeaah, I'm also playing with a priest, but occasionally we get split up. :)
---
&gt;Blizzard has been doing this for a long time and I would think that they have an idea of what they're doing.
---
The solution is to make 5 realms, all named gehennas and the player only see's one. Implement the cross realm shit from BFA secretly. 
---
then when player numbers die down, merge realms secretly. 
---
I knew what I was getting in to but realm queues shouldnt be this big of a problem if you ask me. 
---
Im just salty but I feel entitled to be since I paid for this.
---
I heard VC in BC when i was trying to get carries for twink gear
---
Thank you! I honestly had no idea this was considered a meme because this is how I referred to dead mines back in vanilla and burning crusade.
---
As a rogue, we appreciate players like you alot.
---
Use rank 1 heal. It might feel stupid but that's the effective way not to go OoM.
---
20,000 player queue full is a little different than a thousand player queue big guy
---
but go ahead keep trying to get on whitemane
---
If only Blizzard had announced and warned you on multiple occasions that if you would stick to the most overcrowded servers you were going to have 6h+ queues.. 
---
If only there were lower population servers where you can log in instantly without having to wait...
---
Gosh, wouldn't that be nice?
---
Definitely, it's just hard to keep track of them. I'm pretty certain the first to 60 won't be a streamer.
---
yep lol fair point
---
When I say lock the computer i mean it puts you to the windows login screen where you have to click to sign in and if you have a password on your pc you also enter that. 
---
Just found it is an option: [https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/1782i929D087759F1FD43/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/1782i929D087759F1FD43/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999)
---
It will later on. At early levels the wand is so OP, that it's almost the same DPS as your casts, so there's little benefit from casting at all.
---
But between 30 and 40 the spells start pulling way ahead and you'll actually want to use quite a few of them before wanding. Then you'll be happy about getting more mana back.
---
Oh thanks i’ve just found the post! If anyone interested : https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw4rbj/race_to_world_first_160_table_live_updating_as/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Deviate Delight is gonna be the big Goldshire server isn't it
---
Hunter my favourite lvling class, after  lvl 10 you gonna get pet then fun begins
---
Until Classic Classic WoW
---
uk, 8am 613 people in queue
---
lol my friend somehow got Cùmshot
---
I feel like a lot of people are too socially awkward to even consider this.
---
No benefits. It's being kept only because of it being in vanilla.
---
Why? It's not like I'm nostalgic for the game cause I never played it back then, I just like to make my graphics look good.
---
For me that was right ammount of lazy for single player game. In online games i don't like such mechanics.
---
blizzard gms were always lvl 1 back then, and they can hide themselves, I don't think any addon can track them. Can you /who this character on your server?
---
You mean waste it like queuing? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
"Low pop" is a bit of a misnomer. We still wont know how it will be in a month but any server with occasional queues is holding a quite sizeable population. Blizz posted this a few hours ago:
---
"How it worked before this hotfix
---
As we explained here, the system previously calculated the population labels by comparing all realms to the most-populated realm. This could result in a very crowded realm (with a lengthy queue) showing up as “Medium”, since it was being compared to the realm that had the highest population and a potentially massive queue.
---
This system now measures each realm against a realm’s absolute capacity. Medium indicates a healthy total population on a realm – well in excess of what we considered Full in a 2006 – with room for more players to log-in. You’ll now see a High label if the realm is close to having a queue, and a Full label if the realm currently has a queue."
---
nelf druid?
---
Strong at ST healing. Like shamans are strong for AoE healing (chain heal), while priest has the tools to do great at both.
---
But yeah pala best healers.
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
Ashbringer has been great so far. I went there because I was tired waiting in queues on Shazzrah and super happy with the community feel all around and in the general chats
---
Except that they don't?
---
I just started using a 12 buttons-on-side mmo mouse and i litterally play with one hand (if you know what i mean) khmm soo..nvm
---
But before i used
---
q e r f 
---
shift+q e r f
---
as my main abilities ( tho it will get rid of q and e strafing, which is important but i always strafe with my mouse. Click left and right mouse at the same time and you are good to go)
---
and 
---
1 2 3 4 5
---
shift + 1 2 3 4 5
---
as my not so main abilities.
---
now in classic you will need a lot more keybinds if you want to NOT click on anything
---
maybe add a ctrl modifier to those or.. some hardcore guys  usually set their movement keys to e s d f so you have more keys..
---
At least they bothered adding more servers to your regions.  
---
I couldn't play at launch because I had to go to work early yesterday. I went back to work at 6P.M. and as I knew what was going on by browsing Reddit all day long, so the first thing I did when I got back home was to launch the game and get in the queue ASAP.  
---
6 hours later I was still waiting. I had to go to sleep so I left the queue without being able to play and looked at the server list in my country. Only 1 PvP realm and 1 PvE realm, as it was since launch. They were full, obviously, and no other realm has been added. Two realms for France seem too few IMO.
---
I ain't blaming no one because I knew what I was going into, I know Blizzard worked a lot to make Classic even possible, but god it's so frustrating to see my roommate's lvl 12 Druid while looking at a 15k people queue with supposedly &lt;1 min estimated wait.
---
Today I'll ask my roommate to start my computer and log me in 4 hours before I get back to work. I'll may be able to play for an hour today.
---
Yes, I got it. But I just replied with "my" only issue with it. And how that's fine because I don't expect to play like if I was at home, just queue and do basic shit on my bank character like opening mails etc...
---
DM. If you are unsure shift click the name.
---
Keybinding: Any ability that you regularly use in combat needs to be keybound. Only click stuff that is never time-sensitive (i.e. lockpicking, mage portals, conjure food, etc). 
---
I use a 12-thumb button mouse, so my keybinding is basically 12-thumb + 1-6 + shift-1-6 + x r t g + shift-x r t g + middle mouse + `
---
But you just gotta find something that works for you.
---
Addonwise - get addons to add functionality you want. After playing game for a bit you might say "Gee, i wish i could X" and so you would find addon for that. I.e. addon that combines all bag slots into one big bag, addon that changes unit frame looks, etc.
---
Id say the only "mandatory" addons are either BigWigs or DeadlyBossMods, that provide timers for boss encounters when raiding. Everything else is entirely up to you.
---
General advice - dont read guides. Just explore. You only get to be a newbie once. Dont ruin it. Making mistakes is fine, you will never fuck up your character, worst is you'll just slow yourself down a bit. The magic is in not knowing. As you said yourself, dont ruin it :p
---
Just one thing to keep in mind for you as a warrior - warriors are harder to level than other classes, because they are very gear dependant, and can struggle to solo at lower gear levels. Try to do quests / kill mobs that are your level or lower, and try to avoid higher level quests  if possible (i.e. if you are level 17, your best bet is doing level 16-17 quests, and avoiding 18-19 quests). This is rule of thumb, mind you, not a strict rule. If you're with a friend, that is very heavily mitigated and you will be fine.
---
Another warrior advice is, dont level as protection spec. Even if you plan to tank dungeons, go either arms or fury (id say arms, because fury at low levels is pretty bad due to how hit chance works for dual wielding). You can tank just fine as arms spec if you use defensive stance with a shield
---
in FFxiv there was a 15 min Queue the jumped around 30% in numbers over the last expansion. there was no crashes no lag. i understand that wow underestimated the numbers but come on. they must have had poor management or something i dont see how a company with this amount of money and success can fail this hard launch after launch with pretty much every expansion or game they release. i am loving the game btw even if it does not sound like it XD
---
For NA your only PVE RP realm is Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
In terms of player pop for NA RP realms I believe it’s Grob &gt; DD &gt; BB. Over time expect the population to even out.
---
Question to this, does this alter the autoswing?
---
Only reason I have to ask is I tried this on my warrior last night and it felt like it toggled off the auto attack on press/or interrupt its timer.
---
Yep thats gonna be it. The grace period is there for your spot in the queue as well, so if a person in queue reloads their game, people behind him will go down a spot and then up a spot i guess.
---
I don’t know about private servers, but I really meant it unironically and I had no idea this was considered a meme. I played retail vanilla wow and burning crusade and on my server Executus, I only saw deadmines refered to as VC. It is always possible it was a meme back then but I was too young to understand that
---
I've really been enjoying it. Basically played off and on since Burning Crusade, but was never really able to get into the game the same way I did when I first started. I think the slower pace, the more challenging leveling experience, and the forced cooperation and interaction with the players around you really make it a special experience.
---
That being said, there are a TON of quality-of-life things that can grate on you a bit. I don't really know how much time I'll put into additional characters other than my main because of them. Some of these issues may not be so bad once the populations die down and spread out so we're not fighting over the same limited bosses/enemies/loot. Some others are just an artifact of antiquated UI design decisions, and can be patched up via add-ons I suppose.
---
Hell yeah dwarf paladin ftw
---
This is volume as in activity/number of listings, right, not prices?
---
I don't think this is indicative of a mass liquidation at fire sale prices at all - in that case you'd expect volume to go *up* as people who do not usually use the AH do so to get gold for tokens.
---
This is just a result of people logging into Classic instead at the moment and not relisting their auctions on Retail.
---
The way my job works I only work a certain number of days a week and per month, so I'm free from right now until September 4th I'm living in sin
---
they need to let people play now and figure the product issue out during phase 1 as they see what the dropoff actually looks like imo
---
Best class for wpvp depends how to define "best". 
---
Strongest is orc SL warlock. But rogues or druids can avoid most losing fights so they can just run away and pick easier targets somewhere else. Rogues and druids probably will die the least amount, easy to escape stronger opponents.
---
It doesn’t have queues tho it’s still low a full day after being released
---
So if I'm using autohotkey to rebind R to left click because I only have one hand, Blizzard should ban me?  
---
Or if I use it to bind a extra mouse button to numpad1, again I should be banned because autohotkey is running, right?
---
adding more servers without giving people free transfer from high populance server to low polutated servers wont do anything. at least not a lot. adding more layers will have to do. lets do 500k servers
---
As an Ex-Shaman in Vanilla I can assure you that beating two level 8 mobs as level 5 shaman was possible there, too. Shaman in general was a pretty easy to level class.
---
I am not knowledgeable about key binding and add-ons. But an advice that I want to give you for immersion is to not look at guides too much and ask players. 
---
I did my quests without looking at guides online. I find it more fun and engaging to try and find these stuff on my own by reading the text or asking other players. It automatically makes you want to engage with other players and I find that fun.
---
Also if you got trade goods that are in demands such a say linen clothes because there is a demand for it now or other items that you don’t need, try and consider if you should sell it to other players either privately or on auction house. You are just gaining more out of it if you do it that way.
---
I hope these suggestion can help you. :)
---
Always happy to help.
---
Play the game.
---
Have Classic DB in a browser ready when you dont understand a quest, maybe refer to a leveling guide if you feel lost.
---
For Warrior I would look up a talent build for leveling, and save a shield and a one handed weapon for dungeons.
---
Other than that, just play the game
---
I’m currently enjoying the class of Queue-Master! Easy class with minimal effort.
---
Ask my wife
---
As a tailor it's a pretty awesome way to level it it. I will definitely continue to do so.
---
watch out, it seems that's a controversial idea on this thread
---
mmmm tastes like burnt feet
---
Without a pet til level 10 most likely
---
Haven't done DM as a paladin healer since vanilla. But from what I can remember I had trouble finding the correct gear for a holy paladin. Usually had to wear cloth/leather gear in dungeons, and even then I had trouble healing since I tried to balance healing talents with some retri talents so leveling wasn't too slow. 
---
But it might be that your warrior wasn't tank specced and that was enough to make him squishy. And that he had low quality gear.
---
Don't let a bad dungeon run keep you from healing though, keep at it and add good tanks to your friend list and you'll be blazing through all the dungeons in no time :)
---
The thing is, both can be fun. I personally enjoyed feeling powerful.
---
Only IF had a AH in the beginning. SW and Darnassus were added only later.
---
Hahahaahah..... Haaaaah
---
I give you 2 months before everyone gets tired of the grind
---
You use a phone app to do it.
---
Hakurai has on youtube a complete video level guide from 1-60 with all flightpaths and good stuff. Its a fast guide but comfortable and works for every class! The guide itself is not 100% accurate coz quest xp is a bit off but it works very vell for me. I got lvl 9 in 1 1/2 hrs.
---
That would be so good.
---
I'd hope so. The current game whilst being 'good' just isn't the same as classic. They've made an utterly stunning world with beautiful scenery for what? People to teleport everywhere and ignore the landscape. World pvp died when flying was integrated and the world just seems dead. I would hope they seriously look at the hype around classic as a second wind and get their act together in future expansions. Not just blizzard but other game devs too.
---
*Britishness **intensifies***
---
I just checked the yojamba queues - 2.5k lol
---
I’m at 3.1 with Arugal, May as well stay and tough it out. Dang.
---
Not that I don't agree with you, but I still find it pretty retarded that they released classic with only like 20 servers. Like, what did THEY expect???? And yeah I get it, dead server later is worse than a full server now.(just merge later???) But they really should've seen this coming. How many vets who turned their back once already are gonna hop on this week and get a bag taste from blizzard once again, and again turn their back and never return?  Blizzard dropped the ball with this launch.
---
That being said, give it a few days maybe a week or 2, and all of this queue nonsense will clear up.
---
someone will get hurt...stop this madness
---
Do what ever you like. I knew a Rogue who went axe smithing.
---
Doesn’t really matter what he plays when all he needs to get invited to a staid is to say he’s chris metzen and to jump into coms
---
How is this not ok? Ask ur friend to move around with ur toon in every 10 min while u sleep. I dont think thatn incorrect.
---
Blizzard didnt announce anything regarding tokens in Classic

Last I heard all servers were queuing

Maybe use a desk kappa?

If you arent going all inn then drop it right now as it gives you nothing :)
---
Mostly unrelated... But in vanilla wow did you have to run to a specific location to queue up for things like warsong?? Is that still going to be a thing with classic?
---
They'll have to remove it eventually though, especially if classic continues past Naxxramas.  
---
Plus it's very easy to say "This affects class balance!" if you play a class who isn't reliant on their DoT rotation to get optimal DPS.
---
Warrior is much easier with any other class...extra dps, healing , or tankiness helps warriors in every way considering their gear dependency.
---
Seeing that I have an addon that adds dot-timers to the nameplates, I would assume that it should be in the realm of the possible to have one that shows heals over the nameplates too.
---
Indeed. Hence why stuff like Netherwing questline was a long and tedious journey to earn reputation with the netherwing.
---
Better embrace the run back my friend
---
Literally reroll its been 2 days.
---
I just type it out to avoid this. "Looking for an additional member of our Deadmines party of four. We are currently in need of a healer role. If you are interested in joining our party, please message me. Another thing, please be level 18 or higher. Thank you."
---
he is not a man of culture
---
My next character will be in the undead starting zone. As gloomy it is, I feel that there is a sad and lonely beauty to the zone. 
---
And as a kid, I found some of the places to be genuinely scary but that made it dangerous and fun.
---
So basically depending on the situation, pretty much every class can shine
---
Don't forget they then followed it up by singling out a user comment and calling them a dick.
---
This can happen a lot in classic. Try grinding mobs around ur level until you feel ready for the next zone 😊
---
Most warriors were 2H Arms at that point in the game - not many people realised 2h Fury &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arms, until we were early BWL.. Then they discovered hitcap and Dual Wield.
---
Felt counter intuitive to swap out a legendary for two epic onehanders, but it for sure paid off.
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Depends on what your "goal" is really. Do you want something to do while leveling, do you want to work towards a pvp or pve goal? Do you want money?
---
Im mage and buff everyone i can, alho the mana goes away pretty fast. I also conjure food for warriors and give them (you dont need water as warriors right? Sorry im still noob)
---
I know it's far fetched but ca you imagine if the gms spawned loads more of them and pretended that they were attacking?
---
Nethergarde is the only server I've been able to play on consistently.
---
I recommend World of Warcraft
---
Yeah fair enough.
---
My brand new low server with not a cool name at all had 30k queue...
---
Don't be so salty. That's like saying if your GF uses your account when you're not on you should be banned.
---
Never forget them, I also heal them when in fight
---
Hahaha that’s the perfect human death sound.

Yeah, guildies were saying both so I just created a new character every fifteen minutes just to be safe.

Always the hunters...

how does anyone buy the herb/mining mats if it's that easy to farm them up?

Gehennas eu. Last day tho :) scandinavian server. So worth the que, I know there are medium servers.

&gt;Is there a general "culture" among multiboxers that shames those who engage in unfair PVP?Have you ever received any form of positive reception (in-game or otherwise) when people notice you multiboxing? Especially with such a large number of characters?Why do you do this? Is there anything particularly enjoyable about playing 21 characters, versus playing one? It seems like an enormous hassle to go through paying for each account, and I have no idea how you can spend the time on such an endeavor unless you work in CS or you game professionally.Is there anything that would convince you to do the same on other games, like FFXIV for example? Or is multiboxing primarily a tradition within WoW?
---
Not the original dude, i'm only a 5boxer, so i don't know if my answer is relevant.  
---
Started boxing arround BC, stoped playing in MOP.
---
&gt;Is there a general "culture" among multiboxers that shames those who engage in unfair PVP?
---
No. Some won't act like asshole, some will.  
---
And the community of boxer changed a little with the introduction of wow token and the multi-tapping node in retail. If you ask the that was a bad move from Blizzard.
---
&gt;Why do you do this?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Is there anything particularly enjoyable about playing 21 characters, versus playing one? 
---
Lots of fun. In a game i don't like taking the same road than everybody, multiboxing is pretty much one of the only uncharted territory on wow where you can discover something, find strategy that no one thought about. 
---
It's a gameplay extremly deep with a lot of meta-gaming if you dive into it. You spend a lot of time perfecting UI, in-game macros and such. You can't have the same level of micro-management than a solo-boxer so while you can't setup something perfect to aswer an issue, you're goal is to try to be as close as possible.
---
&gt;I have no idea how you can spend the time on such an endeavor unless you work in CS or you game professionally.Is there anything that would convince you to do the same on other games, like FFXIV for example?
---
Well, i did that in vanilla FFXIV too, idk the state of the game now. Like i say, it's a different gameplay.  
---
It's a lot of fun to play multiples class at once.   
---
Imagine for one sec that there is a class with only two abilities, will you have fun to play it or do you prefer you're current classic character with a lots of skills ?  
---
Well, it's the same, for us, you're the one with only few keybinds. If you have fun, with that, it's good for you, i know that i wont.
---
As for classic, i was planning to join a guild with mostly 5man boxer to try to do raids but with all the queue everywhere, some of us leave to low pop realm, so we will see in a week if we can assemble or not.

Don't worry about being behind. There is no true "being behind" in this game, as there will always people around where you are. Just enjoy your journey. Learn things on your own pace. You chose the perfect time to start the game!
---
I too died to murlocs last night. Over committed and couldn't back out of combat fast enough. but it felt good to not be an immortal champion of justice who doesn't die in the rando world content anymore. 
---
Made me feel small, and yet strong when finally achieved the kills.
---
But you are instantly put in the queue.
---
I'm not saying that it's fair
---
What I'm saying is that yeah, ok someone else did move a bit their char so that they don't get disconnected. Since we can't verify that they did not do something else (beside watching the stream and seeing that between the moment he left and the moment he comes back, There is a level difference, or else), he is not ''guilty''
---
And yeah, to me is exactly the same as accepting à queue for someone else while he/she is in the toilets, or answering the Phone.
---
They shouldn't be à double mesure as you said for streamers, but this works both ways imo, they shouldn't either be punished for something every couple / brothers / friends do when they play together and everyone gets "away" with
---
Beside, if there is 10000 People waiting in queue, it's not only the streamers fault, they can choode a different server knowing this one is full
---
It was really more of a question on the colloquial use of the acronyms opposed to what the actual acronym would be if we used the dungeon titles. I played during vanilla And the burning Crusade and on my server, Executus, I never saw anybody use DM for deadmines and was expressly told not to because of Dire Maul. I whole heartedly meant this post unironically and had no idea that this was meme
---
Ah, yes, attached to the nameplates, it's plausible. However, in the images OP posted, the nameplates were disabled.
---
Wonder what the start of his Que and wait time was...
---
just grind, make sure you dont avoid mobs that you can kill easy, all xp counts, grind some level 9 monsters until 12
---
Isn't one of the Devilsaur-sets BIS for Fury-Warriors?
---
Also you have the armor kits, so there's at least one benefit while leveling.
---
Because they have tripled, approaching quadrupled, the number of servers. 
---
I don't get how people defend this shit. Yes launches are always busy but there where queues of more people a server can take waiting to log on to the servers.
---
People are saying that it'll take ages to get levelled up anyway so I've got less panic about "Being behind" in classic, so for now I'm trying it out and seeing where any of my friends land. 
---
Think most I had was 10 minutes at like 10pm last night.
---
Because other people also have friends on the server, and want to play with them
---
Personally I would probably say Druid because you can roll a tank or healer for group content which will be more sought after than a DPS.
---
Is your friend 12?
---
Did that quest with my brother so needed 12 all together. We both found some spawn locations and waited. I managed to find a loop of three so once i did the loop once i new the order.
---
Super late to the thread but people like Kungen and Sco got stuck in the queue so I'm assuming those streamers just exploited the character screen AFK timer thing like a lot of other people did.
---
Ye Im on a full server since its the "official" scandinavian server.
---
I'm going to cry
---
So did I! That’s why I brought up the questions I genuinely had no idea that this was considered a meme and mean this unironically
---
Mostly initial hype. It will die a little bit, down the line.
---
My point is your desire for instant gratification is going to ruin your experience. Just learn to be patient and wait a damn week for the bumrush to subside and then you'll be able to play without any bother.
---
It's Tanner from high school!
---
Rogue is easier, druid is hard mode.
---
yeah but when you start at launch in the first seconds after release do you really wanna start another character because some people didnt put sum effort to get into it ? i dont have problems with the que because i have google remote and every one could do that
---
Yesss, I’ve found the community to be great so far!
---
I was in westfall last night and everyone is helping out, inviting for quests. Been loving the server so far :)
---
It's not blizz fault your a moron
---
&gt; I'd like to go on a low pop server so I don't have to queue - but I don't want to be in a dead server a few months down the road, especially with no word on realm transfers.
---
This. I can't believe they didn't implement it. I don't care where I play now...even lowest populated PvE server has shittons of players...but once the hype is gone, it will be a dead server, and people don't want that.
---
  Run to the undead starting area immediately and continue leveling in Silverpine Forest and then Hillsbrad. Do every single quest from an Undercity npc. And yes quests give you lower reputation gains once they're green and gray.
---
There isn’t much RP in where I am playing now, but the players are nice and not having it be constantly full is a bonus.
---
How long do you think it'll take to get 60, even with guides?
---
Just write out Deadmines, unless you are short on letters on your keyboard.
---
Fuck off with this. You know it’s deadmines and that dire maul is DME/W/N or tribute.
---
Guys, can any of you share a screenshots or pdf files of 20-30 please :)
---
shut up dude
---
Classic runs on dx11.
---
So me and my friends who took one of the new ones that opened the same night as classic (Mograine) thought that it's better to play a low before and then move.
---
But ohh is still 3-4 hours and that was one of the emergency realms.
---
So your saying my friend now that's 25+ needs to reroll yet another server from start even though we changed before opening?
---
I mean, there is no simple long-term solution to this. It's better to just accept that week 1 in launches is a shitshow and accept that.
---
Nah, it was a US server, but I can't remember the name.
---
Pve content isn't just raids, wod's raids were good but they were the only thing to do in game.
---
Yeah you can use teamviewer as a phone app too, I prefer to use it on a PC though when sitting behind a screen anyway.
---
I got in fine last night. Had loads of fun :)

---
Im just going to use this to vent a bit about this topic.   
---
I feel that I cant decide on anything when it comes to Wow. I dont like leveling but I dont actually have enough free time to get to level 60 any time soon.   
---
At the same time I dont know which class/race to play because of this. I want to play a priest because I want to heal when I get to 60 but I dont want to level a priest ...which is realistically the only thing that I will do before I get bored and quit ( before reaching lvl 60 ).   
---
I want to play a Warlock but I know that I hate being DPS and I wont enjoy it after reaching lvl 60.   
---
But I still started a lock because I think that I will never reach 60 so I will just try to enjoy leveling it.   
---
Then what race? I love how undeads look but I hate their starting area and just thinking about having to be there for the first 10-15 levels is making me want to quit already. I love the Barens but I dont want to play an orc...  
---
At the end I will just try playing the lock again today and quit :( ...
---
Exactly! With all the posts that I am seeing it would appear that the community was pretty split and the acronym used might have changed depending on which server you played on
---
they should let 20k extra players in
---
I'm thinking about this but the problem is when the server issues are fixed, when the population settles, when people inevitability start to move on, where does that leave what are now the medium and low pop servers. Who knows how long it will be before they start to reduce layering, and if they ever will offer server transfers. If not you "could" be sitting on a "dead" realm for quite a while. Which is a massive issue for both levelling and raiding in 1.12. Maybe sticking with the full servers now will be better in the long run, impossible to know as we have no numbers, and er're very unlikely to get them.
---
I think you over shot Razor Hill
---
My experience so far as a warrior:
---
&gt;!Position in queue: 15737791873391238!&lt;
---
I'm on Nethergarde Keep, medium server. Queued for 65 minutes yesterday. :( 
---
#changeplox
---
Did you start playing on private servers?
---
There were massive queues on the new realms they pointed people to too
---
As a dwarf priest I try my best to save fellow players from certain death.
---
i just wanted to know if theyll add transfers, so i can play with my guild, caz im still going to play on golemagg because i have the means to beat the que
---
Zug zug, wat iz "water'?
---
Maybe you should re-read what i wrote..
---
Deviate Delight forever
---
There is definitely layering in effect. Was playing with my brother and couldn't see him until we grouped.
---
To be fair a big reason why private servers was popular was because it was wow for free.
---
I'm treating classic as the journey, not the destination. I'm still playing retail for the endgame, but once I'm done my WQ/dailies etc. I pop onto classic and do some levelling.
---
You see I'm confused about this. I'm playing a rogue and it is auto updating my spells for me? I have no add-ons installed and I keep get my latest ranks. I can't even find old ranks in my spell book
---
I’m gonna say, between 1 and 3 weeks.
---
The current year?!
---
30 minutes should be fine, I have Teamviewer on my phone as well in case of an emergency.
---
But at this rate, it seems like I still we be in queue when I get home.
---
This is actually a pretty good idea, but the developers said that a cooldown has been put on layer changing, which would make it pretty difficult for such to work.
---
So what many people are facing is starting over on another server without the guilds and friends they planned to play with. The root of the problem was the stringent number of servers during the name reservation, when a big portion of the more dedicated playerbase set their plans. There were only 2 eu pvp servers to choose from at that point.
---
I can understand opting for moderation to prepare for server health down the line, but the initial estimation was way off and quite frankly turned out to ruin my launch days with all the layer crashes into repeated 5-10 hour queues leaving me to consider the option of playing alone instead. Or maybe even uninstalling and canceling the sub if this does not smooth out by next week.
---
Priest leveling is pretty easy with a wand! Not much downtime and you will always find quick dungeon groups!
---
&gt;That guy should have been fired at the very least.
---
I mean... It's pretty hard to fire the guy you're grooming to take over as CEO. It's not like he was just some employee saying the wrong thing.
---
AFAIK *any* fire source that shows it's name when you mouse over it can be cooked on.
---
No queue as of 12.00 server time
---
It isn't Blizzard's fault that nobody listened to their CLEAR warning about queue times.
---
This is wrong! They're not l staring at a queue.
---
Nobody has an answer to that question yet.
---
Didnt know /s was the mark sarcastic.
---
Really don’t see the problem. How’s it any different to me getting my Mrs to log me on when iam at work to cut down queue time.
---
Retail, a "mobile game"? What the hell do you mean?
---
I'm hoping only a week or two. Right now I'm waking up at 4am and playing before work for 7am lol
---
Anyone encountered some slight aggro bugs? I’ve had yellow enemies aggro over to me when something has happened to the person attacking them that I haven’t interacted with. I’m talking quite far away too.
---
ill just wait for the transfers i wanna play on my first character created, i  dont want to start a new char on a new realm that prolly its gonna be full until i finish my shift and we ll have the same peoblem again, if people really wanna play they can, if they put 0 to none effort of course they gonna watch the screen for 6 hours
---
I would Enter your World girl 😂
---
Mine worked fine. Try willitclassic.com
---
Yes, but will it play WoW?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
What server ?
---
This I agree with. It's an expression of the general change the widespread adoption of the internet has effected on society. Why bother with real friends, long term relationships or time consuming activities when you can just go online and get thousands of new "friends" and things to do?
---
Personally, I'm just wondering if this is not a bit like a pendulum. Before the internet, it was held to the left, figuratively, and I feel that it is now very far to the right. I wonder if it will, eventually, come back to rest in the middle. There's a markedly increased interest in analogue things, so I thought it might, in a crude analogy, extend to games as well.
---
If you wanna do some serious raiding Warrior is the only viable tanking option.
---
Facepalm
---
Thank you :D
---
People mad are probably teens that don't know what working all day is.
---
Really a pain in the ass when after work you have to wait so much time that you'll be unable to play...
---
I thought this too, but when everyone is trolling and being a total ass, who's left to care? I really hope you're right though. To this day I remember the names of some people on my old realm that people would refuse to play with due to their reputation as ninjas or trolls.
---
The original rollout of servers was an abysmal failure and showed incredible lack of foresight and competence, especially considering the amount of data they had to work with, but it seems like some of you'd blame yourselves if a Blizzard employee drunkenly rear ended you at a red light so whatevs
---
Ah, good ol' Blanchy!
---
These players have seen them on pvp realms, in the opposite faction.
---
It's not fun going to pvp realm to just get instant killed by 1 player.
---
That's standard for C, C++ and C#
---
EU Ashbringer ftw
---
Daggers leveling only viable for duo leveling with tank. 
---
And for leveling build, try something like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbxc0xZGcZV
---
I'll hijack and ask opinions on a troll warrior as well. I've started with Mining and Herb, with the idea of making the extra cash i'll need as a warrior. Should i have gone skinning?
---
Not sure, I think one or two are missing, I’ve been getting knocked down by duskbats but no animation for it.
---
It's the game that promotes cooperation. Where as retail doesn't promote cooperation.
---
Another hunter. You’ll be able to pull off some fun stuff as a team of four.
---
Method has all their players/streamers in Vegas in a big event hall, they are now coming online after sleeping and guess what, none of them are in the queue.
---
 Not only bypassing queue by any means (autoclicking, account sharing, scripting) is banned, but it is also extremly scummy.
---
And this coming from what many agree is the best guild in the world? What kind of message does that send? If nearly everybody finds a way to avoid logging out (and method getting unpunished clearly proves that you should), queues wont take 10 hours, they will take 100
---
The orc racials are strong, but I would guess the starting areas are way more crowded.
---
grab 2 gathering profs or tailo/ench
---
This has been my experience with single named mob kill quests.
---
All these stories do not seem fake at all.
---
Very disgusting
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
Wait, Twitch forces you to have breaks on stream?
---
Please please let us enter alternative timeline with good classic-style expansions
---
Because high/ medium/ low servers are compared to the highest pop realm on the continent.
---
You can do such things with the default Logitech keyboard management software as well.
---
I don't know how easy or even if they can see the difference between a real click and one through this software through their client. I guess it would be easier to detect suspicious behavior by pattern; "Not moving, not talking, not doing anything but to jump from time to time? -&gt; Flag as AFK". But here I also have no idea how quick and easy they can implement such a thing.
---
Eh it's something at least, mine lasts 2, can't be given to anyone outside the group and requires rage o//
---
Made a druid yesterday but i'm still not sure what to play it's so hard... That's why i choose the druid so i can do a bit of everything hehe
---
Decent...no. you can't front stab with this build of wow client.
---
Nice! Have fun! :)
---
Several lvl 35's on Incendius last time I checked (hour or two ago).
---
Exactly, I came back for legion and it was quite good actually and then they started this progress reset every patch , I dropped. Basically whatever you achieved in 4 months could be done in less than 2 weeks. What's the point ? Tried BFA, same shit, I'm done.
---
Surprised that people ignored Blizzard’s post a week or so ago telling players to expect queues if they didn’t move to new servers? 
---
Ye i’m not surprised either. Bunch of stubborn entitled brats.
---
Re-roll on a less populated realm, it’s that simple... 
---
This is not necessarily directed at you OP
---
This is real, trying to keep myself from starting it.
---
Forgive me going slightly off-topic, but my issue is choosing the correct realm.
---
I'm looking for a NA west coast PVE server. My options are Atiesh, Old Blanchy and Myzrael. All are listed as "low population" right now. Which is the most active? Anyone know?
---
If all 3 are critically low and not worth choosing long term, I'll settle for a PVE NA Eastern server, I guess. That leaves Mankrik, Pagle and Westfall. Which is best?
---
I plan to play longer term so I need to get this right. There's no guarantee there'll be a character transfer option available in the future, if I screw up. Would be grateful for any help or insight.
---
Yup
---
You do realize the plan is to eliminate layers entirely and literally have one physical server per realm, right?
---
Big same
---
Yep! I was doing the same, ended up making some decent extra silver and a guy ripped me 40 (yes forty) linen cloth. For one bag.
---
Press shift over the item and it compares with the one you have one so you can make a judgement yourself
---
I genuinely cannot wait for them all to leave. There are always going to be trolls but the idea of intentionally making someone elses day more frustrating for your own enjoyment never really made sense to me.  I always just felt a little bit sorry for people who feel the need to gain recognition this way, as I imagine they don't get much attention from others in their real lives. It's a bit sad really.

Leaving yourself open there brother. Better off removing.
---
Lots of people in my guild are 25 and wont reroll, but would probably server transfer. It's 2 days of time when they have taken off work to play, it's not "just 2 days" for lots of people. Worst fucking release of a game in history.
---
Only used it today so i hadnt had the chance to see it in action :D
---
I hope to cross paths with the same players i meet while leveling.
---
Have a nice journey friend!
---
Dude just restart wth lol. I left a level 14 mage on whitemane and switch to the new server thunderfury. Having a great time and I’m already level 12.
---
Hmm allright ill be honest and say i played with Finnish and Norwegian dudes and their internet wasnt always great. No clue about Sweden tho!
---
Is that actually against the rules in any way? I dont think someone could get any type of punishment for that.
---
Can't you take the zeppelin and quest in Durotar if you hate UD questing zones ?
---
Warlock is a lot of fun to play with lots of utility, epic class-quests and the best looking mounts. My vanilla main was warlock, I definitely recommend it
---
If they went the Classic direction with Retail in 9.0, you will experience salt the likes of which you have never, ever seen before. So many will cry about how hard the game is and how slow paced it is. 
---
Attention spans are mosquito-like nowadays, especially with the younger crowd. It’s why twitch games with short matches (fortnite) reign supreme.

It's considered self-harm if streaming crazy hours..

Sure. So far it evens out. But the only gold the multiboxer needs on his alt accounts are for the token. All the rest he can just give to his main account. So if you farmed for 1 token and 100k for you in the same time the multiboxer farmed his 20 tokens and 2 million extra for his main account

Spent the past 2 years playing OSRS and 5-6 years in RS3 on-off prior to the WoW classic launch so I'll chime in a bit. All I can say is that the voting booth is the best and worst thing that has ever happened to Runescape. QoLs often pass these polls but the supermajority (75%) vote is such a [controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ch9ny8/warding_poll_results_megathread/) thing because Runescape is such a divided community. It doesn't help that everyone in OSRS gets to sees different value in their content because of their playstyle and stats (i.e: Raids / Inferno / Ironman / Maxed). Hence, not everyone will react to updates / new content the same way.   
---
Just a few months ago, the third proposal for a brand new skill called "Warding" in OSRS failed its poll. This skill was initially proposed and the redesigned twice because the first revision was completely against the old-school nature of the game. Afterwards, the final design document was made available to the public to read and completely scrutinize. Reddit exploded with memes and everyone suddenly became a game designer. It also did not help that Warding was the 3rd proposed skill ever in OSRS.  
---
The failure of the poll lead to soo much divide and meta levels of speculation that the community will never be in favor of new content. While Jagex will eventually use the assets shown for Warding in other content down the line, you could imagine the intimidation and pressure they have to face when proposing completely new content.   
---
There are some genuinely good updates that resulted from voting booth system, but developers should know when to put their foot down and not cave in sometimes.
---
Managed to level with a warrior to level 9 without him dying lol
---
Sure its not as black and white as dead or alive server. But a server with more people in my opinion leads to more opportunities for more groups, more guild options, active wpvp, and in general just more.
---
Sure a medium server will be fine, but will it be as fine as a high server? Maybe. Maybe not. Im willing to risk it and endour a few weeks or months of suffering (its only day 2). Because I want that experience that offers the most and not just a good or ok amount.
---
Oh thank you. I thought there was such a thing, but couldn’t figure it out.
---
It clearly shows when you haven’t touched the game for years and years.
---
Reroll
---
Dwarves joke is not in :(
---
There were paid character transfers in Vanilla...
---
And what would you even buy, besides overpriced cosmetics that barely matter in a first person game where you almost never see yourself?
---
What about engineering?
---
Thank you for having such a good time!
---
That is literally what we all want :) I'm glad that is what People are experiencing!
---
The community just becomes one unit when it Comes to Classic :P One insanely ~~hot~~ strong unit!
---
Might have to do with less players in the zone as well, but sounds neeto.
---
65mins is nice. Try 5hrs of queue
---
Lol, me and all my Scandinavian friends are just on a medium server, still seems like 50% of all the people I meet are Scandinavian. Don't know what "official" means here.
---
Swords are the best.
---
Ha it was so funny, I suggested forming a line and someone told me to F off. Then we grouped up with some of the people present and the person that was rude declined the invite. Then we killed Garrick with our group before the rude guy even had a chance to click him. He was furiously typing insults but still refused to group or line up.
---
I wonder if he’s still there now
---
On a higher skill level they are easily abuseable. Not really a challenge for most classes if played well.
---
They can be rly strong vs bad-medium players though
---
Yep, shift button, usually supplies with base pc option
---
I thought so lol

3 hours in the gym, hour and a bit of weights and an hour swimming

Thanks for the informative reply!
---
4 am EST is best
---
Still level 10 feelsbadman. Barely been able to play with these Mograine queues. Worst part is when you get in you eventually get kicked out and put in the back of queue.
---
Lmao. Each server has a queue . They won't be dead.
---
It is just the quicker way to post a pic from your phone
---
Combo points were target specific instead of Player specific.
---
If you build 3 combo points on a target, then switch to another and comeback to the first one soon enough, it will still have the three for example.
---
yeah ik, low pop realms are bigger than the average vanilia realm back in the day but its not about that, i just want to play on the char created at launch
---
This argument keeps getting pushed further and further back. First nobody would switch from pservers because they'd have to pay. Then everyone will play for an hour and hate it and go back to BFA. Now we're at the stage where everyone will quit in a few weeks/months. I look forward to a few weeks time when it's shifted to "the game will die once everyone starts raiding".
---
&gt; Yes hunter pets can tank.
---
The hunter can get higher defensive stats than the pet.
---
He bought? Crash it.
---
Razorgore had a big queue yesterday as well
---
Re rolling to a gnome mage is the ideal profession! No but seriously, you can never go wrong with engineering and mining for any class. But I personally love the synergism between tailoring and enchanting. Alchemy and herbalism is also really fun because you can always be buffed up!
---
From some census from last year I think druid class was only at 7% or something. Just above monk
---
That person logged off at 38. They're flying.
---
They have to if they realisticly want to move guilds and communities.
---
People are committed now.
---
At least the guy had the last laugh.
---
i feed my pet every half hour regardless of its happiness
---
my pet works hard i tag sometimes 3 mobs at once it nearly dies several times an hour, it deserves extra food until it has alliance corpses to feast on
---
I had the same yesterday. But I was greeted with a 20k queue instead lol
---
They just switched the algo so full just means there is a queue, so yeah, every server is full. It only proves my points that people are crying over dead servers for NO reason. You aren't entitled to anything given the MASSIVE amounts of warnings both Blizz and the community put out prior to launch. Reroll or just deal.
---
Then either one of you or both aren't geared and/or talented properly.
---
Taiwanese WoW is technically run by a different company. It's slightly cheaper to play on a Taiwanese server so they wouldn't want people to buy a Taiwanese sub and then just swap onto an American server. 
---
I'm an American living in Tokyo and I'm playing with a friend who lives in Taipei because Classic is a social game and we're trying to learn Chinese.
---
Nice, thanks for the advice! I can't wait to get to Duskwood!
---
So like, 4?
---
Handed it in after DC while queued and came back 5 min before getting in ^^
---
Just... Role with it.
---
The queue I waited in on launch night had a particularly assertive Dwarf marching up and down yelling at people to move along, fill gaps, five to a group and so on.
---
I tipped him a few copper on the way out and I've since friended him and made a personal note to address him as Foreman in future.
---
From now on if I end up queueing I'm going to be drinking in line (and maybe giving out a few mugs of stout to people around me) and giving drunken sorta-racist rants about gnomes.
---
RP is all about improv and working with the situations you're dealt. You can't just follow a script to the letter.
---
Ik never played WoW but always wanted tot have the vanilla experience even I feel nostalgic

That causes the issue of the character name conflicts. If two people prepaid those 2 weeks before launch to snag their name they've been using since vanilla each on different servers, but those two servers get merged... who keeps it? How do you make it fair? 
---
It's not a game breaking issue like the queues but it just shows that not every solution is without it's own problems
---
Making a druid wondering what professions are ppl going for? Thinking of going herb/alchemy i mean potions should be useful while leveling and in pvp right?
---
Or do i just go for gather like mining/herb will that make me more money?
---
explain pls, i'm on shazzrah but haven't heard of :)
---
This is true but the early content is hyper saturated
---
Making it a difficult situation to play
---
Have you played on any of the low pop servers? They may well be bigger than vanilla, but vanilla didn't have layering and the mass of people rolling on low pop servers as alts just waiting for their preferred server to settle, artificially inflating pop until they move back.
---
I've rolled alts on 1 low pop and 1 medium pop server, and they are dramatically less populated than the high and full servers (obviously) and this will only show more as the servers settle. There are people complaining they are finding it hard to get groups for Hogger, some quests around IF and others like them, I know, I've been on these servers. I've also chatted with a few people who have said they're just running alts for fun on the low pop servers until the servers settle where their main is based.
---
This is not a "non issue" for a lot of people, and has nothing to do with complaining about queue times. Knowing how this will play out with reduced layering, server transfers or merges no one knows, which makes saying this is "NO WORRY" frankly stupid and misinformed. You have no idea whether it's  a worry or not. No one does.
---
I saw a few clips of his that kept popping up on my YouTube homepage and thought he seemed like a cool guy. Checked out one of his streams one night and dude is a massive dick bag. Him and his group ganked a guy from the other faction, and justified it as "if you don't like it don't play on a pvp server." A few minutes later that guy came back with his entire guild and camped their corpses. Him and his whole group raged like little bitches and I left the channel. 
---
He also bragged about baiting people through DMs into making threats and then having his horde of 13 year old followers mass report to get them banned.
---
Hunter loot!
---
The 1st guy has the right idea but makes the wrong point.  It's not that it matters that much that people will be 60 before we even get on the server, it's more the dedicated people will power ahead and those of us stuck with queues will be left with the tourists or the people who don't know how to press buttons and that makes the levelling less enjoyable.
---
I see it a lot in FFXIV.  If you don't get clears for new Savage content in the 1st week, maybe 2nd, you're better off not bothering because the practice parties after that are... not good.
---
I *know* they did it by design. That's *exactly* the point of my comment. They did this *for the long term health of the servers*. Not to satisfy the impatient gnats during the first week. *I'm very pleased with their decision*.
---
No. You can switch target for 0,5 seconds. You lose the points.
---
I guess now you can sell enchants again since people actually use the greens
---
WoW classic really makes me *feel* like Batman
---
You're not weak. 10+ hour queues are insane at 2pm Central on a Tuesday, the queue started at 10am central. This is Labor Day weekend in the states, this is going to get real fucking ugly for queue times unless Blizz does something about it.
---
Yeah, wake up at 6.30 , feed my 1 year old so wife could get some more sleep, make some food for wife, put kid to bed , wife wakes up, take a shower , go to work, return at 18.15 take a shower and go play outside with 1yo while wife makes dinner , eat dinner , put kid in shower , he eats and goes to bed. Its around 21.00 now , spend some time with wife . Get in wow around 22.00. 
---
If your only job is going to school and washing your own dishes then yeah. But the demographics show that most players are 25-45  from reddit infocharts
---
I forgot how accurate that episode was. Here I am killing boars for hours.
---
what do you do? just wait until they rip off?
---
I had roughly 24kwhen I came home from work yesterday
---
You forgot:
---
Type 4: Cringe story time
---
yeah right ?
---
&gt; everyone else is using it
---
[x] doubt
---
There are alot of fights were you need off-tanks, it's not unusual to have 3-4 Tanks in a raid, especially on progress. Main Tank is out of the question if you want to play casually anyways, no guild will funnel their ressources in a tank who can't make it to all raids.
---
On holiday here, seems im not missing out lol
---
Just make yourself a favor and DON'T do this. Forget talent builds and shit, build your own character! Put points in whatever you think will be good for you! 
---
Leveling guide pff. Really?
---
Classic DB can be useful, but try asking ppl ingame if you have a problem, it is good for the health of the community!
---
I think people are way over worried about servers dying.  There will be plenty of people playing.
---
&gt;  skinning gives crit?
---
The best way to go about this is in the battle net friend window change your online status to offline and then play on a different toon since he could recognize the toon you play with him on. When you want to play with him switch back to online status, just make sure youre not on your separate toon when you do so.
---
No. You have to go to the bg instance at the start of classic.
---
All my mates on arugal, Yet to play there. And they arent going to move.
---
Complete joke, Been kicked out of queues as well... Hahaha ya kidding blizzard
---
Highest level on my server is a solo leveling warrior. Not quite what. I expected
---
I’d say, if the name is available on the new low pop realms, just go for it. Don’t want to get stuck in long queues for the rest of your vanilla carrer. Trust me, they won’t be able to fix this, I work in Network related IT shit. No chance of this getting resolved, without sacrificing the true vanilla feel. (Login servers would have to allocate resources from places they can’t reach, which they can on retail)
---
Lmao
---
Honestly, you can make a decent amount of money with mining and blacksmithing. People have zero gear right now and will buy your crafted stuff. Even the vendor is a good option for whit gear that won’t sell. Personally, I don’t care for herbalism all that much but you can also make good money off of fishing and cooking! Good luck fellow warrior!
---
Loch Modan has at least 4 quests suitable for your level and Dun Morogh also should have some that will still provide decent XP.
---
Hey dawg, we heard you like queues
---
They Will because they want to have a 75% dropoff during phase 2 to remove layering
---
I'm sorry, but you're trying to hit a nail with a spoon here.
---
Your best bet for long term happiness is just to be honest and open and say that you and your friend just want to play by yourselves sometimes because you want to experience it through the lens of a new player.
---
Assure him that you'll be on another toon, so your accounts won't all end up desynced with regards to level, but that this is how it's going to be.
---
People were warned weeks, days prior to the release about queues. Forums were filled with "not moving". Now people are in queues complaining about being in a queue.
---
The problem there is all the people with the same name on the 2 servers
---
Really depends on what role you want to play
---
Pure DPS: rogue and mage. Melee vs caster but both very good. Mage raid rotation is just frostbolt spam, not sure about rogue
---
Better overall healer: priest and you can play shadow but bear in mind respec costs if you plan to raid because you will most likely be healing
---
Hybrid: shaman who brings awesome utility for groups and can heal decently
---
That sounds like exploiting. Why would they want this to happen. Level your lock picking how it’s intended.. by picking locks
---
I am certainly obligated to pay for it, if I want to TRY to play.
---
Sat in a queue for 9 hours today. To think Blizz didn't think that the servers they opened would get used.
---
I decided to go with mage, but I don't know which professions should I take. Tailoring for sure, and I'd like to pick also a gathering profession to make some money. Which one's the best? I'm leaning towards skinning because some pieces of leather are needed in tailoring.
---
Is this really the grafic ? looks nice
---
 This... What the OP said is so true. I have friends on Firemaul EU which are off work to play. They login, sleep and be up in 9 hours to play. I work and I have not seen my character select screen while 4 hours prior to launch. I cannot move as I have a guild/friends Here but I also want to play the game I resubbed for. If we had free transfers confirmed, I could go play on a server with my friends which also work and cannot log in currently. Then we can move once the time is right. It seems such a simple solution but I guess every free character transfer is £15 that blizzard has lost, so they do not want to do it.
---
Just did this at 11.30. I'll be loggin by 5, just after I finish lunch.
---
Well thank you for this information.
---
You need to select Classic in the game drop-down on the Bnet launcher.
---
Hot take: Blizzard knows that classic will have an extremely hyped launch but expects the player base to tumble off a cliff within a month or two and as such don’t see a reason to “over-prepare” for launch week. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Yeah switching targets will lose CP, however you are able to use mouse over macros to blind or kick a target without losing CP! 
---
This was actually not possible in vanilla until after 2.0, and is a product of utilizing some of the code from retail due to how mouseovers work now.
---
Next level
---
Yes I did and do play on a low pop server and they are fuckin packed dude. Absolutely brimming. Just because they aren't OVERcrowded doesn't mean they are empty. There was a queue to get on my 'low' pop server last night and as more and more people finally get past their stubbornness, there will only be more people joining. 
---
Everyone here is acting like an armchair dev as if they somehow know more about server demographics and longevity than a company who has been doing this for 15 years. Get over yourself.
---
What is blessing of salvation
---
You are the problem with the world.
---
Lowest Mobs in Redridge are level 14. Not really an option for a level 10.
---
Ok so wow classic is my first wow experience and I was wondering why everything in Westfall took like no damage... Thx
---
Waiting a week wouldn't be a problem if we weren't literally paying for our time. If I'm waiting for it to blow over I'm making it rain in the garbage.
---
Why hunter?
---
Thanks, I’ll definitely try this out once I get in!
---
Meh. First couple of days. Give it time and they’ll all be merged.
---
The queues will die down in about a week's time so don't sweat it
---
I got to the auction house really quickly, saw a guy named Forsale selling Darnassian Bleu for 99g.
---
I put up some ragged leather gloves for 2s. Somebody bought them.
---
Layers are there to allow more people to be on the same server without overflowing the same "shard", then when launch is over and the server population decreases, layers will be removed. Think of layers like: Herod A, Herod B, Herod C, Herod D etc. but instead of opening more servers (which in the long run would just lead to many different servers with low population) they are using layers to allow more people on fewer servers. Server cap is not the same as back in vanilla.
---
And how many people are doing it? I would love to hear the numbers on that and how THAT of all things is the problem.
---
It's funny to see people " you'll never make it 60 " wtf does that have to do with waiting for 7 hours to play a game which is obviously aids as fuck
---
Retail apologist acting like they were working at blizzard at the time of cata release and all the big dumbing down and accessibility changes in wow. Please go on lol. CoolStoryBob. What was your role in the company mate, or were you just playing the game and have pulled this reasoning completely out of your asshole? Hmm. How about this buddy, maybe there’s sometimes more than 1 reason behind things in life, so when you say “it was this reason here, and this one alone” you look incredibly stupid, you’re obviously wrong and you should learn some self awareness. You’re probably young, but try grow up a bit. Cheers!
---
If your friends aren't willing to switch servers then it isn't really blizzards fault is it ?
---
This is exceedingly nit picky imo.
---
Thanks.
---
Did you force login on another computer or did you log out and then login?
---
I managed to join a Low pop server in the EU yesterday evening. There were too many people to even get a single mob.
---
Smite spec is arguably best till 40 lol
---
The name reservation was to gauge interest, but people who didn't care about names only resubbed just before launch or even after launch, there were even queue's to sub to WoW! even in the best projections, i don't think anyone could have predicted this
---
That's a pretty damn good deal. I would have jumped on that.
---
No, not without getting banned.
---
&gt; Blizzard controls the token price
---
In the same way the stock market controls stock prices.
---
No you can't they fixed that
---
The lvling guides I was thinking of was "Lvl 20-22? Go to this zone".  Other than that youll ask someone obviously. I forgot ppl actually have step by step calculated guides theese days.
---
 I thought communicating with other players came with the statement, "Play the game" since ots such an integral part of Wow classic.
---
Sorry for rustling your jimmies mr Elitus
---
Chaos is a ladder we must climb
---
You'll need to grind out a few more levels in the mean time. Find yourself an area with the highest possible mobs and grind some xp.
---
Probably druid then. They're extremely annoying to kill, on par with paladins imo. Maybe slightly easier, depending on what class you are.
---
Oh ok, i had the impression that classic is a tryhard heaven. I'm gonna try it cause retail is starting to become way too easy and repeatable..
---
Right, sorry brother
---
Out of the near 300k people browsing this subreddit you think that not a single one didn't knew until now and will now do so?
---
Snipping tool is the easiest imo, but they are removing it.
---
People like you are the worst part of classic tbh.
---
I've been playing since Vanilla and hell no there weren't queues like this, all people claiming this are either remembering it wrong or just plain lying. but the hype will be over soon once the they reach lvl 40 and things start to slow down the queues will be shorter.
---
That’s making assumption WoW’s infrastructure works like that. Which it most likely isn’t.
---
I can’t think of a game off of the top of my head that works like that.
---
Chillhop Summer Essentials.
---
We already switched servers to Incendius which was a new server on launch day. It got full already.
---
I believe queues will get worse by the weekend actually :p
---
Hey i want to lvl a dps class and i cant Really decide between warrior or hunter i used to always Play melee but not sure han i det dine pros and cons and og Antons have other rrecemendations Pless lidt then too
---
I waited for about 5 minutes in the clusterfuck and then said nope and moved on.
---
It's optional. People aren't forced to use a server discord... Saying that though I miss the old classic forums days.
---
I'm glad for that :D 
---
I just like the idea of being a weakling working together with other weakling to accomplish stuff.
---
There may be same names populating in illidian2 and illidian. Now you cant merge them. Also I dont think merging two servers is that easy anyways. What will happen to my lvl 35 warrior in illidian when my same character is now lvl 45 in illidian2?
---
This is what I'm hoping
---
What's a RP server? 
---
I'm new :(
---
The prison bars you are looking at is in your mind.
---
I'm actually serious tho, technology has *progressed*. When you use prtscr (or, as I would rather recommend, snipping tool (shortcut windows button+shift+s)) the image is put on your clipboard. Most places where you upload stuff allow you to paste directly from the clipboard with ctrl-v, assuming you didn't ctrl-c some text in the meantime.
---
I'm serious, try it. Hit prtscr (or snipping tool), go to imgur.com, press ctrl-v - no other steps, no need to hit "upload" on imgur or anything, just the straight www.imgur.com site. Same with reddit, if you go to submit a link and hit ctrl-v in the link field it will automatically upload your screenshot
---
Hopefully not because there are others who are waiting in queue while you're hogging a spot just to be AFK.
---
In the blizzard launcher - on the wow page -- above the play button there should be a drop-down menu. There you select wow classic.
---
EU servers shut down at 3am this morning. To change some things and add more servers.
---
Thanks for the insight, 
---
it's true and overlooked generally, but community demands often directly contradict the devs views and goals of the game which made the game great and loved in the first place. 
---
You're absolutely right that Devs should be the higher ups and only they should propose new content / features. 
---
Further selection of who can vote on what should also be considered in special non general cases. 
---
Balancing of abilities for example should not be decided by the community at all, with PvP in mind there would never be a fair vote.
---
This is also one reason why I'd prefer they make the switch to TBC first and let the player's decide if they want to stay in "no changes, ever, classic". That way we'd have vanilla classic for those who seek the original experience and an alternate version with OSRS voting post TBC (if this ever happens).
---
No there should be a dropdown in the client for wow classic, look near the play button
---
I just logged in again at the same time this morning with no wait again. Idk what to tell y’all.
---
Honestly, uncalled for. Extremely thankful for what we’ve been given, just had a bloody question. Thanks for the video suggestion though, sweetie.
---
It's the first week, no shit.
---
Right but people didn't use the classic forums to form groups. And you're right no one's forcing anyone to do anything but the mere advertisement of a separate Community can cause there to be two separate communities where people are looking to form groups which obviously can eventually make it more difficult to form a group. Everyone should be in the same space.
---
You seem pretty full of crap. Level 10 twinks were not a thing outside of maybe a handful of people here and there.
---
Did the polls already happen? Is it possible to get a link?
---
I see, i'll give it a shot.
---
Oh boy here we go
---
The grace period shouldnt allow that unless the server itself is crashing?
---
That's like paying for Netflix only to find most of the videos are broken and won't play then someone saying it's fine because some videos are working.
---
They lowballed the numbers deliberately, there’s a blue post about it. Stop defending “you think you do but you don’t”. We clearly fucking do.
---
Dude, that crap gives insane armor. I Thanked a druid who gave me it randomly so much he even laughed.
---
Yeah I liquidated as much as possible and got 12 tokens. I think most people with a lot of stuff did that.
---
Bro as he said, he has Mental health issues.
---
You're totally right if it's about a regular person.
---
I'm not quit sure if that is possible without long term problems.
---
As for you op.
---
Option 1: Say that you and your mates, need time some time for your crafts. You'll need to level your profision and we all know how time consuming and boring it can be.
---
Tell your brother 2 things. 1. He can't halp you,because he would only be in your way.
---
2. If he asks for his profision. Say that you're sorry and it's waaaay to complicated for you.(if even his brother can't do it he will be scared to do it by himself)
---
Do your things eventualy he will get offline and you can make a group again. Make it full. And apologize to your brother and say that the group is full when he asks to join.
---
You will outlevel him, ypu could make some twinks if you want to play with him.
---
Option 2
---
Sit down with him and tell him that everybody loves and likes him. But you're friends don't have much time to play cWoW and you need to speed up.
---
Option 3 (if you want to go the extra mile)
---
Go on his acc and play an mage to your level.
---
Give him only 3 spells
---
1. Frostbolt 
---
You will make a makro so he will only casts it on the target from you 1.tank (if not there) 2.you.
---
2. Frostbolt
---
3. Making water.
---
This option minimizes the skilllevel needed to be usefull and with the water he can still halp the team even if he casts only the bolt and white wand hits.
---
I hope i could at least gave some ideas. It's really heartwarming to see how much you care and how much the feelings of him matter to you. No matter what do, you're a good brother/sister.
---
I apologize for my grammer and speeling!^^
---
Oh I see, ark is the end of a word 
---
Carry on :)
---
Actually was pretty bummed when my renew+lesser heal couldn't keep this guy up just outside UC gates, mercilessly massacred by doomhounds. I was just half a second too late, also didn't have rez yet. Playing wand spec priest is a power trip so far (played warrior/shammy in vanilla) I'm ridiculously mana rich, like I don't drink at all between pulls, plenty of juice to keep the randoms around me safe and it does feel nice. Also a surefire way to spot the retail players, They don't thank you...
---
That’s the appeal.
---
Well even for voice chat the game also has in game voice chat and it surprisingly works well.
---
You can enchant your bracers as many times as you like. If you have a bit more time you could offer them as freebies to other players as a nice gesture.
---
If yes, it will be way down the line, when (if) realm populations start to fall of. They will not open transfers on day 3. Be a man and reroll
---
"Hey I just started playing yesterday and have absolutely no experience with game design. Allow me to tell you 46 reasons why you're WRONG and you're fundamentally fucking up the game!"
---
As someone who actually rerolled on a server that I can just log into and play instead of having to wait for a queue, I feel very good about them.
---
The server I originally intended to play on had 22k queues at launch and yesterday at primetime.
---
So saying I rerolled might be wrong. I had joined a guild prior to launche who went on that server. But I never actually set foot there since after 2 h in the queue I had enough and went to bed. And since next day the queue was still as long but new servers had appeared, I happily chose those.
---
Yeah I couldn't believe my eyes when it said that it was only 4 gigs, I just double checked my original box from 04 and it actually has the same storage requirements, I'm stoked!
---
i started lvling a mage yesterday, can i wield a wand as well as my staff? if so then where do i get a wand from? only have 9 silvers..
---
everyone trying to avoid the afk disconect should be executed for exemple.
---
Yeah, if you buy a ticket to a plane that is labeled "full, but we are adding more planes right now" that's okay if it is actually full.
---
Infrastructures are malleable, surely they have plenty of software engineers.
---
Oh ok, cause here in retail everyone is like curve this curve that have skills link stuff and etc.
---
So i figured classic would be even more hardcore, ipl definetely try it.
---
Yep i know but it still happens, and to quite a lot of people. My theory is that it's just individual layers crashing and not the entire server.
---
Best thing is , you will come home and there will be queue in front of your main door as well.
---
Hi, /u/Kioz
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwj1s4/i_gathered_4_zeevra_hooves_in_arround_8_minutes/). 
---
I don't get how Blizzard can deem multiboxing to be fair or a legit way to play the game.
---
No.  His point was the guy got promoted after that.
---
Ok, why does old school runescape have more players than rs3 then? Clearly people prefer these older games to the shitty current versions. It’s still gonna have tons of people playing.
---
You don't even need to upload the screenshot to a third party, you just select the file and directly upload it to Reddit when you create the post.
---
May I see more from you two
---
Legion would have been amazing were it not for the obnoxious time-gated artifact power grind.
---
It's interesting how many people are totally pessimistic in regards of the future population.
---
You totally neglect the fact that private servers had huge amounts of pop before. There was a study done that Tips covered on his channel which found around 100k concurrent players during prime time some years ago distributed between different projects. That's around 25 full servers with people playing at the same time, without any hype, just because they love the game. 
---
And this time it is the official deal that everyone are waiting for for two (13) years. There won't be 20k queues after a month, but nothing is dying either.
---
And most importantly, this isn't nostalgia as many people claimed. It's the best version of one of the best games ever made becoming available after a decade.
---
Cheers
---
You dont need to be in a group for guild engagement. And fyi, if you join a discord server and communicate with fellows on there, surprise, you've joined a guild.
---
Why would they have tokens? No changes... Except tokens? Lol.
---
Or just have a grown up conversation about how he is being an insuferrable twat and you won't play with him like that? 
---
We had to for one in our group doing the same shit super annoying
---
I've heard of tanks and healers reserving the first righteous orbs but can make more solo dungeon farming.
---
Do you see how all these servers all full? You will be wanted as a DPS just be a nice guy and if you make mistakes own up to it and learn from it. Turn off automatic growl, dismiss your pet if jumping off cliffs, do not run out of ammo
---
bad bot.
---
True, ill try it since bfa is starting to bore me more and more by the day lol
---
It will 100% be completely and utterly unplayable during this weekend and possibly the next as well. Unless you swap to one of the new servers being announced every few hours or so.
---
I get what you mean. It's weird, I started with Wrath and played a bit of every expansion, but this version feels the most immersive to me.
---
Retail right now certainly doesn't come close.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
for my warrior, to get gun skill to pull from range (charging or body pulling into a camp of gnolls does not make for a good day) costs 10 silver .... 10 SILVER? WHERE AM I GETTING THAT?
---
so if you wanna wait 5 hours again?
---
&gt;WoW was good back when everything was new and fresh.
---
Must be why bfa was such a hit huh?
---
That's the problem with modern day though, if people find a way to play the game differently then they will I guess... I agree it will be a detriment to the community in-game but people have that choice.
---
IIRC, they're tied for highest dps in the game in most/all tiers and they're also hands down the best tank class.  So... really fucking good.  Imbalanced.
---
NO
---
I remember seeing 8 shamans in AV once... absolutely destroyed the incoming alliance.
---
yep!
---
Duh, everyone knows they're lowballing the servers. 
---
You said in your op that you don't want to switch servers because your friends are not on those servers and in that case it's not blizzards fault your friends don't wanna switch for you. 
---
And randomly insulting people because you're mad about something that everyone knew was gonna happen makes you seem pretty retarded ngl
---
It sounds like you did everything right. Van Cleef is a tough boss, so don't let it get to you. Perhaps your group was missing damage output? Sometimes just having an extra level on everyone can get you over the gap.
---
Queue\*
---
That’s not called nostalgia then
---
Basically because your average player doesn’t enjoy farming and they’d rather pay the AH prices. 
---
This was effective in Vanilla and it’ll be effective in Classic.
---
The server caps are at 12k right now. Just wait until phase 2 when layering gets removed and the server caps are reduced.
---
It's just silly and unnecessary though. I didn't even know this was such a thing.
---
I heard good things about tailoring/enchanting
---
Tailoring is for your gear, bags, and selling them of course since bags are always on demand.
---
Enchanting is also good to enchant your own stuff and help your guild
---
No dual specs.
---
Eggplant = Word used by whites, specifically italian americans, to describe blacks.
---
I do too, because then the whole economy will also go through that and there will be 0 spontaneous player interaction all over again.
---
It's the same story as LFG automated add-ons
---
Thank you comrade warrior
---
I agree there's nothing you can do about it other than talk about it in a public forum and hopefully dissuade people from using it by using reasoning. I mean when you get the invite you're inclined to accept it but I think when people take some time and think about it it doesn't make sense. 
---
At the end of the day everyone's free to do whatever they want to do
---
It's actually trivial... If their software is well maintained I could update it in days...
---
Tried aux, didn’t work either

Just how a real athlete plays more than one sport.

Bingo

Mine like 3 hours
---
Most people can’t spell queue
---
raizQT got to level 29 before ending the stream
---
Just came back to this post to point out the current five highest level players are all Mages :)
---
I sold my buff for 3 silver. Only 1 person bought i thought it was funny.
---
That's what I was thinking
---
Hi, thanks for writing!
---
We currently have 5 priests but another one can't hurt I think. :) We are short on Warriors (for the later raids, especially Naxx).
---
We have a Discord: https://discord.gg/dvs9yew
---
After you've joined, we can talk about the details. (Planning to run a dungeon in the evening, might not notice, please be patient in that case, thanks!) You can look around, there are quite a few channels. You can read a more detailed description of the guild's philosophy in #info.
---
No, that's not even remotely a close comparison. It's like paying for Amazon prime and not getting a free twitch sub for a month. You still get free 2 day shipping, which is the whole point if prime anyways.
---
Wow are you good. You are the first person who ever thought about that...
---
In germany we only have 4 or 5 servers which all have over 10000 people in queu after work and like I said I want to play with my friends who already play on that server... Makes no sense what you write.
---
Shaman twinks are scary in 39 BGs...  Early Windfury = instant death for a whole defence room...
---
This is so great, please wear this outfit in Ironforge from time to time to make people chuckle.
---
Yea, I didn't expect spending yesterday evening ironing, cooking, tidying up, watering the plants, etc. either. I guess WOW is good for my productivity now.
---
Yeah we have no way of telling that though. Blizz has been too secretive with everything. 
---
You're just speculating.
---
Ripperoni
---
You are aware that there have been external server forums in Vanilla, yes?
---
Plus, it shouldn't be big of a deal if all the people want the "authentic classic experience" and thus the majority would never ever use that, right?
---
Get a Teamview and log in from work 4-5 hours, so when you come back, the queue is fine.
---
It is a launch thing and it will go away in a week or so, for now this is what we have. it is better than not having anything. Also the game itself does not feel laggy at all to me when I get there. I think you worry too much about the smaller servers but I feel you, with your friends moving over to different server. They were just too impatient.. but that's the way it is. Gotta talk with them and see what to do. Everybody knew this was going to happen.
---
Hey don’t feel bad - I was a hunter main in vanilla and managed to get to level 18 without training my pet...
---
From 10-18 WITHOUT growl on pet was horrible. (If anyone else is in this same shitty predicament look for the beast training spell in your general spell book 😂)
---
I still play retail and I have no interest in playing classic. When I logged in today for the weekly stuff, the world was packed. it seemed like there were 2-3 full raid groups killing the world boss and about the same amount in the weekly chest room.
---
queue simulator 2019 looks so good
---
Have been a ret paladin for like 15 years but never raided in Vanilla. Is it really that bad? Been playing arou d with talents and I can do a hybrid build as holy/ret since holy only has about 20 points of noteworthy talents but am I really just never going to get into a group?
---
I won't lie, I quite enjoyed some of the dungeons in BFA. That being said, there's no way I'm going back to retail after having played classic.
---
MILK WAS A BAD CHOICE!
---
Took me about 7 hours. Sped up considerably after getting out the mosh pit that the undead starting area is.
---

---
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND NOW I HAVE TO WAIT?
---
I got 1 at level 3 on my hunter, 0 on my level 20 druid. GG.
---
For anyone else looking, here is another one that is much larger

---
I reached lvl 10 in 4hr 57min on a dwarf priest raised in Eleanor forest. Playing the early A’s straight from memory has been such a lovely experience. Seeing the other players group up spontaneously for trickier quests is heartwarming
---
It's about separating the communication from the game. It's okay to have a separate program where you communicate with voice even though there's voice built into the game now. But when you Advocate people forming groups and communicating through text chat somewhere other than the game that can lead to community problems. 
---
At the end of the day anyone can do whatever they want I just wanted to put my two cents out there
---
Doesn't that mean they are DCing?
---
it's only really unhealthy if you do it consistently, as a once off/every few months/bi annually etc your body will manage just fine not sleeping for 48 hrs
---
Appeal to authority fallacy.
---
hey he was a hunter
---
Apparently they patched it out, sorry for getting your hopes up!
---
You can literally shapeshift on the move.
---
who the heck has 5g to waste?
---
How is chat spam ingame "perfect"?
---
Better that than dumping the whole idea, IMO. It would have been really neat to have a unique zone like that.
---
When you are on the server list it will tell you which servers you have characters on and how many are in each. 
---
You should be able to find it that way.
---
 Whatever the case may be, there is a global trend towards stakeholder centric governance.   
---
I'd like to see evidence of that, because there are a million and one examples that contradict you, stakeholder centric business fail or don't get the opportunity to become as big as Acti-Blizz. Amazon is skirting actual sweatshops on American soil and is one of, if not the largest corporation in the world. Practically all stakeholders are replaceable in a global economy.  
---
Like it or not, Every decision is profit driven, and profit driven means stock price is the golden number in the current system
---
I played EsO really uninteresting for me at least.
---
But ill try classic cause im sick of being op and basicaly only needing others for dungs/raids.
---
I like the idea of needing others to do stuff cause we're all weak and need each other. As i said i feel nostalgia for smth i never experienced haha.
---
I guess you’re outta luck until it comes back. Maybe just grind for an hour or so? Work on some professions? Check again. 
---
Personally I’m using an Addon called Allyroute  instead of a website for this exact reason. It’s been great step by step guide and I’m leveling pretty fast for me.
---
Saying Blizzard is being stubborn in this scenario actually made me laugh out loud. Blizzard is doing everything in their power to AVOID dead servers. It is the players who are being stubborn as fuck who are 100% at fault for the queues.
---
ok tyty
---
I get both sides of the arguments made, and I dont know the technicalities of it.  
---
But that doesnt stop the tinfoil hat I have in the corner that whispers to me it's a conspiracy and an attempt from J Allen Brock to make people frustrated so they dont play Classic ("Man, fuck this if it's always going to be like this"), add a ton of servers to appear as the good guys, and then let the servers depopulate so the initial people dont return or if they do, they think the game is now empty and this makes it all a huge self fulfilling prophecy of his.
---
But that's because I dont like him or think highly of him.
---
In truth, he will probably take credit if it remains successful, even though there is a trend of the game losing subscriptions the more he was involved with it.
---
Have you ever seen his interviews where he talks of raiding in Vanilla through Wrath?  He uses the most generic, non descriptive language that anyone who learned of wow in 5 minutes from a friend could use to try to fake being a raider.
---
"Yeah, I remember the boss and our guild wondering of we could kill him and it was close because we were spread out, but we beat the boss and no one died."
---
newbe here, is it possible to "rebind" the points ? if i realise i have put my points in useless crap ?
---
I agree. They cheaped out and held on til the end with doubting Classic. They shouldv launched 20+ servers during name reservation, and then another 20+ at launch to start.
---
Maybe I'm dumb or I missed something, but where do I get rage and demoralizing roar. The teacher in moon glade does not have it...
---
How is developers doing what they want without community involvement a good thing when you have a poll system? That is exactly how people got RS3.
---
Gaming isn't a sport.
---
Fuck blizzard for releasing 12 servers initially when that was CLEARLY far too few
---
I'm rolling horde (i'm from golemagg that also has insane queues).
---
&gt;Hello and thanks for reading the post.
---
&gt; I want to choose a class+spec that is unorthodox and rare. I am currently very torn between Prot Paladin, and Boomkin (I want to have just that particular spec all the way to 60 no matter how frustrating it might get).
---
&gt; I'd like to ask You guys, what do You think I have better chance to be allowed into endgame as (I don't mean early progression, but 10 men and eventually 40 men content in general)? Protection Paladin is really dungeon friendly, but I doubt anybody will let me tank UBRS, especially without defense cap. Boomkin has very bad (and deserved) reputation as bellow average DPS. Both classes have some utility that groups might take me on board for.
---
&gt; Can You share Your perspective and tell me which one might be better / more enjoyable to play in a long term, and which would be friendlier choice for joining groups doing level 60 content (UBRS and MC especially)?
---
&gt; P.S. I know both specs suck. But that is the point of me choosing between them.
---
&gt; Thanks in advance for Your replies.
---
Paladins can tank raids, but its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work.
---
I dont disagree, but I'd say its immersion breaking. Makes all the characters just look like action figures.
---
But are they harder to kill because they are running away?
---
What I mean is that, if there is a big fight in Blacksmith in Arathi Basin, would I be able to heal and still be hard to kill, or I need to run away and let me teammates die? I just like how paladin can just stand there and spam heals and shaman is probably better choice for that because of grounding totem and mail armor? Thank you for your post, someone else said druid, and its much easier to choose between druid/shaman because prior to this post, I was also considering a priest.
---
I don't get how people can't, if they haven't read it they would spell it cue, right? (Which is also very wrong)
---
Oops you just reminded me!
---
Greenshot all day brother
---
u/Annoying_Red_Mascot where u at, bro?
---
Maybe you're right and the problem is not technical at all. I don't know if they use AWS for WoW servers but they definitely have the resources to scale the demand. But a server is more than just some a piece of hardware, as the post suggests they will have a lot of difficulty getting rid of dead servers down the road.
---
The queues are absolutely ridiculous for all of the servers these past two days. Next week might be a better gauge of which server is better for the long haul if many people decide classic is not for them. If it stays like how it is now for the next couple of weeks, you might as well just choose whichever one doesn't have an insane queue so you can actually play.
---
If they perform a simple action at a fixed interval it's pretty clear, or if they perform a simple action at an unfixed interval for an extended period of time
---
They had years to do that, and it's not as hard as you seems to think.
---
Read some of the other comments to get a full explanation of what's going on here. People didn't use server forums to form groups or they didn't very often. They would use the looking for group Channel or trade Channel or general channel in game. It it happened pretty quick
---
My issue is that somebody wants to Advocate players using a text Channel that is not in the game to form groups. Communication is one thing. If you formed a group in the game and then said hey join my Discord that's totally fine. But when you Advocate the server population to join an external program in order to form the group initially we're taking away from the classic experience at this point.
---
Besides BFAs raids have been amazing. Only redeeming thing about the game right now.
---
And I'd still rather do the classic raids. Even though they aren't as good. They just feel more meaningful. I know BFA has amazing raids yet I don't want to do them. That's a sign of a bad game...
---
Unfortunately I don’t have a desk job and don’t have access to that while I work.
---
Well it's a fact that the number of realms is too low for the demand. Also, a modern low pop realm is more populated than a vanilla 2004 one.
---
Worst case scenario you transfer your character in a couple months.
---
He’s right though
---
Yes enchanting is the other one that I always pick with mage, but is very expensive to keep it up on the first levels... Thanks for your help!
---
Everyone got what they paid for, they told you before hand there would be queues. Either you wait it out or play on a different server until the queues are gone. 
---
Demanding to have everything you want on the server you want when you knew before launch there would be huge queues is the definition of instant gratification. The irony is most Classic die hards claim instant gratification is what ruined WoW, yet here they are crying over not getting it.
---
In a week's time the hype will die down and you'll be able to play on any server you want or is that not instant enough for you?
---
It feels alive like nothing else in Azeroth.
---
Chrome remote desktop works well enough to log on and beat the queue, just not enough functionality to actually play
---
The best thing in Vanilla, is the fact that you have a feeling of small things matter. Every green item, every piece of silver you acquire.
---
This is how it goes on most servers
---
After waiting “in queue” at work lol
---
Demon Taunt
---
"Fuck you"
---
Yep they messed up big time and I hope they'll find a way to fix that
---
Just no.
---
I just don't think you put any thought into the damage this can do to the community. At the end of the day people can do whatever they want to do just like I can give my opinion about this. And if someone that's been really looking forward to this and I'm having a lot of fun playing classic I don't want to see the community hurt because confused new players don't understand that the in-game communication is perfect and is actually a large reason why classic has returned.
---
There's really no reason to be rude.
---
Complete WoW noob here. I queued for 5 hours yesterday, finally got in and got to the opening cinematic only to be disconnected and 10,000 in the queue again - no D/C protection. 
---
Not a great first impression to be honest.
---
Classic noob here: is the auction house linked cross faction so it’s one big pool of items or is it one auction house for each faction?
---
D3 OMEGALUL

he plays PoE now though
---
He's a PoE streamer. He's used to it.
---
&gt; But that's barrens! The only place for shitttslk
---
I read that as “Shitsickle.”  As in, “The Barrens is so hot and dry that you’d be thankful for an ice cold shitsickle.”
---
They were kind of rare because of their complexity. Raiding was all shadowbolt.
---
When you level solo =&gt; health
---
When you level with someone who can heal =&gt; armor
---
Snipping tool is on every Windows machine by default though, like Print/Screen. Downloading something is way past what these OPs taking phone pics can handle.
---
You know at first I thought clocks was a misunderstanding as well but considering all the DoTs I'm not 100% on that, at the very least I really like the term lol.
---
Imagine going through your whole life and not knowing about IRC or the massive amounts of shenanigans that happened there in vanilla
---
Sport isn't a game.
---
u wrong
---
Also best tanks in Naxx.
---
Nah, it happens when DCing.
---
I'm no software engineer, but for fucks sake guys can you give the people at blizz more than 48 hours to come up with a solution to this mess? Step of the ledge for a minute, we are all in the same boat.
---
Phone?
---
So... we gonna ignore the fact that you hace keybinded A S D F G? you psico!
---
Yes, this is weird. Queen bees establishing their cliques, and people starting to orbit around them. I hope the realm forums pick up. That's a place for everyone that doesn't directly compete with in-game interactions.
---
Give the man a break he made an original joke unlike the hundreds of people literally posting the same thing. Its pretty funny.
---
senjin torches &amp; fire with a pot on top will not let you cook.
---
But next to it is a bonfire that can be used
---
Nicely done, how many deaths on the run?
---
wow, 10s is expensive...maybe I'll wait a bit longer :D
---
Yep, this is my group's problem as well.  A bunch of us took time off from work and have been playing on Fairbanks with no issue, but come prime time when the rest of our friends get home from work, the queues have been 6+ hours long.  The one's who took time off work have put in too much time in our characters to re-roll on a server everyone can play on, and even one of the new servers that our other friends decided to roll on the first night ended up having a ridiculous queue the second night, so they had to re-roll \*again\*.
---
At this point, we don't even know if we'll all get to play together and what happens when we all go back to work next week?  Are we not going to even be able to play the characters we have on fairbanks?  Are we all going to just be fucked?
---
I know opened more and more servers has the potential to be unsustainable in the future, but fuck.  90% of the hype involved in this, at least for me, was to be able to play this game again with my friends and that is not happening right  now.
---
Then you need to create more problems to solve! (That's how villains are born)
---
"Queue the Desperate"
---
I believe dual specs were introduced in WOTLK. I'm glad you got to learn something today before finding out when it's too late!
---
&gt; t it happened pretty quick
---
No, it really didn't.
---
&gt;My issue is that somebody wants to Advocate players using a text Channel that is not in the game to form groups. Communication is one thing. If you formed a group in the game and then said hey join my Discord that's totally fine. But when you Advocate the server population to join an external program in order to form the group initially we're taking away from the classic experience at this point.
---
Where is the problem with that? If people want to use it, let them use it. If you are correct and most people don't want that then this would never take flight. But you fear that most people end up using it and thus that you are wrong, aren't you?
---
Plus, the entire "Hurr Durr everything that isn't trade chat spam is destroying the community" stuff is bullshit anyways. No one forms a relationship from just getting invited into a group.
---
Started on Thunderfury and made the guild &lt;Windseekers&gt; (H). We're up to 90 members less than 12 hours after launch.
---
So exciting. Can't wait to do some big group world pvp.
---
W/ me in game, Thunderfurry (Druid) or anyone with a &lt;Windseekers&gt; tag for an invite!
---
2 hours? That'd be nice lol
---
Or dropping the frost nova when a player is getting dazed trying to run away from a group of mobs.  So satisfying to save someone at the last moment
---
could be either tbh
---
Then play without it
---
Level up with other players around you? Have your friends from your guild helping you out?
---
I know it sounds crazy but I think it's possible!
---
No, but if you pass through the same inn, and the same guy is jumping in the same spot an hour later, you can take 5s to report it, and have blizz check it out.
---
well, dont use Questie. Just remember the quests like everyone else
---
The problem is that you need a dedicated role in raids, hybrids simply don't function well in there.
---
Hybrids are kings of dungeons, but raids? There's no reason to bring along someone able to do both things half assed if you can get someone specialized in it.
---
That being said there will be guilds that will take you as most of the content in the first couple of raids will not be too difficult, but it really is as bad as people say, they are a defensive DPSer, excellent in pvp, but garbage if you need to pull your own weight as DPS.
---
I get that this number will never be exact. But they have had 15 years of full ques. They certainly have metrics and data that lay out things like average time played to give a better representation of when the que will be up. 
---
It sits at 45 minutes for 3 hours.
---
Flippers aren't paying to win though.
---
It will get easier. You have to queue every day, thats the hard part, but it will get easier.
---
I would like transfer from servers to new low pop and maybe even more servers right now to fix the que problem..
---
At the end of the day  i would just play what i like.
---
First of all they all have to reach 60 to be  " competition" secondly there is logs and dps meters now so a good player will always have a spot
---
Can't even see the tanktop he's wearing underneath all dem layers!
---
How the fuck do you take a picture of your monitor without feeling deep shame
---
Quite the fact. In Vanilla/Classic you are just a warrior on his journey, an adventurer. In BfA you are literally the Chosen one. And this begun with WoD Garrison.
---
it's a flair. check how to set yours on the right side of the page.
---
&gt;but it hardly takes out of the box thinking to come up with a solution to your problem.
---
"just solve the problem before it ever exists, what's the big deal"
---
EU is fine.

original group
---
Then they need to be handing out free time to everyone for a week. This is their fault and we are paying for something we can't play.
---
I guess that makes sense. I'm sure people are playing longer than normal. It's just frustrating to stare at the 45 minute estimate for 3 hours.
---
Warrior saved my ass the other day. Accidentally pulled two mobs was OOO and slowly losing heath, then Bam in with the charge the Warrior helped me finish off the mob with me being an inch away from death. I quickly Mana up and hit him with a buff, thank him and then went on my merry way. God, I missed this game.
---
... this is how layering works
---
I want to say there’s a stickied post just for this
---
Everyone just used thot or wowhead to look up coords anyway
---
I'm a huge proponent of listening to your players, believing what they say, and developing how and what they want you to develop.  OSRS is a prime example of this - almost every single change to the game, even the minutiae, is polled with players and has to hit like an ~80% "yes" to make it into the game.  That's a good approach, it allows them to focus on things that the players want and avoid implementing things they don't.
---
But even I have to admit that you obviously still need a team of in-tune professionals overseeing and having the final word on what gets into the game.  The OSRS team still reserves the final say, and although they'll very rarely implement something that players did not want, they will occasionally "veto" something that they did want, for example if they realize that a change might have some unintended and undesirable impact on the game.  The people in charge need to make sure the game stays within its own bounds, make sure it doesn't change into something else.  Of COURSE there are things your players want that you simply cannot give them.  Go walk around Shattrath in BC and ask every rogue you see whether he wants Warglaives.  You'll probably get 10/10 "yes".  But does that mean that you should, as the developer, materialize a pile of warglaives and hand them out?  Because that's what your players asked for?  Fucking of course not.  
---
It's not like it's even that hard to walk that line.  You just have to not be an idiot and do stuff like class homogenization, or easy-mode raids.
---
/flex
---
Whenever I see her, I just can't help but to think about that shitty val'sharah storyline.
---
you should try and explore the zone to get new zone discovered XP... ding a few levels :)
---
It's not about whether or not what people want to do it's having the understanding that one Community is a good Community splitting the community up will eventually lead to difficulty finding people to group up with. You have to look down the road and passed your own personal "don't tell me what to do" bull s***
---
Again. Wouldn't call you a bookworm if your bibliography is made of the Wheel of Time. You need to have both breadth and depth of experience.
---
In classic, the best paladins do it all at once.
---
Might misremember the name :)
---
yeah I agree that was also fun...until they implemented global scaling, now you can feel weak all the time!
---
Gotta have a sub to access classic

I think the only mob that had more kills and wasn’t in AV was Vael. Those pillagers are beasts.

Usually applies to the servers.. etc. Not your 9 friends lol
---
Make sure that you're reading the correct guide, use the one for WoW Vanilla/Classic. Some items changed quality over the years.
---
I play on a folding table like that. I feel attacked
---
You see the red equipment status in the top right? I guess he did.
---
They need to open servers and offer free character xfers already to let the Max pop servers filter out.
---
LMAO
---
Haven't got the chance: just arrived to lvl 8 now. I'll give it a try! Seems way more satisfying hahaha

With talioring you can make greens and dench them

Most feral talents really aren't all that great, most pvp druids have at least 21 in resto for instant heals, and the feral tree simply doesn't offer a lot of bang for its cost, you also want omen of clarity and the roots from balance, so it doesn't leave much space in the feral tree.

Not really. It's just to avoid afk timer kick. But I.m usually back at my PC in 15-20min. Wouldn't use this when I would be away 1hr or so. If I know I don't have the time to play for that period of time then I won't log on.

Think you missed the point of the post

You can, but it's gonna be a bit on the expensive side especially if you keep respeccing.

Also, there's no "just remember the quest" for new players.

Happened with me too.  A guy was getting chased by a mob 3 levels higher and I ran over and frost nova’d and started to cast frostbolt.  The guy ran back into melee range and got killed immediately lol.
---
That way you'll also have a lot of rested XP so you don't have to grind the last levels in a bracket. I don't really care for that tbh.
---
I think it's fine, since there are a fuckton of people. It's just up to people from the 2 big servers to spread out.
---
I went out of my way to to buy shoes because I still hadn't had any at LvL 11. Is that normal?
---
So your friends are selfish idiots. Just like how my friends are selfish idiots. They play on a server with 10k queue in stead of playing on a server that everybody can play on.
---
do you sell the leather to the vendor or to the ah?
---
Hang in there. Enchanting is not an easy profession to get up and running
---
Mabye a dumb question but havent read that much about layering at all. 
---
Lets say there is a queue of 17k to a certain realm. Couldn't blizzard just open four new layers and every one's happy? Is it to costly or what's stopping them? Or is layering something completley different than what I've been thinking..
---
I thought layering was there to prevent this from happening? 
---
Yes, I'm in a 600 minute queue now because I had to leave for 40 minutes and buy a new headset. Slightly mad..
---
My barrens chat was talking about Bush's granddad being a Nazi supporter. I tried switching people's attention to Chuck Norris jokes but it didn't pan out well.
---
Feel no shame friend, I legitimately have a toe knife straight out of always sunny that I cut my toe nails with.
---
This is so stupid there's a 5min grace period to get back in before queue and acting like a child slamming the desk for internet points much wow
---
You can't mount at all in Undercity because it is considered indoors. You could mount in all the other cities, only the stores and service buildings were flagged as indoors.
---
There is one combined AH for Alliance, one for Horde, and one for the Goblin cities.
---
Right. No one even considers reading the text.
---
He's now up to about 36-38 as of an hour or two ago
---
Imprisoned in the queue for 10 thousands years, banished from my own realm, and now you dare to login?
---
You are not prepared..
---
What the fuck ahah
---
That would have no use for me sadly
---
You can go back bud
---
Priest here, passing out Fortitude like it's candy!
---
Just being able to give out buffs to passerbys on your way to traveling somewhere and having them sometimes thank you feels a lot better than the might-as-well-be-AI feeling of retail WoW. Even moreso when you start recognizing some names that you may have passed by before/buffed/or even saved from dying.
---
Moonlight streaming is very good, but Teamviewera is fine
---
thanks?
---
Fair enough!
---
Enjoy man,hopefully the site works soon for you!
---
Yes still but why hide it ? Classic is huge succes allready, showing total number of players would just benefit them, for instance in DOTA2 client u can see currently how many players are online and how many unique players in total tried game...
---
Couldn't get farther than lvl 6 on Lucifron because of random disconnects and queue resets. Leveling a Paladin on Patchwerk until the situation with Lucifron gets better.
---
I don't play PvP, or barely, so I won't talk about Ashran as I maybe went there twice. But yeah, overall WoD was awesome boss-wise, slow pace-wise.
---
What if I am able to log in instantly on other realm? Do i lose then?
---
The new ones are pretty good tbh, Firemaw, Mograine, Ashbringer etc. Some others tho..
---
I went to Razor Hill to have bags made. We were a group of 7 or so waiting to get them made. I began Raping (not  a RP server) and shouted, "I'm next! Get in line you scrubs!"
---
I proceeded to point out individual people and /rasp them for not standing in line. Finally, we did. The guy behind me was standing too close so I said, "Back off. I can feel your kodo breathe on my neck." To which he retorted, "It smells like your mother then." 
---
I threw down a /roar and challenged him shouting, "I will fight you here in this line whelp!" We dueled. I won by the skin of my teeth and brushed it off like I was the best warrior ever and /flex on him. We had a blast... Waiting in line... To get bags made...
---
You sound like a thot
---
I’ve played consistently for the past 15 years and classic is exactly as I remember it except people seem more social than I remember.
---
Same for most people, which is why until we get a dev post about the topic the only thing to do is wait in those ques.
---
True people are complaining about 20k odd queues so it doesn't feel like their solution of just opening new servers is working
---
I was able to join a server with medium pop so I have no problems. But yeah I get your situation
---
Honestly I'm just waiting for WotLK to come around again to play holy pala again and just stack intellect lol.
---
Fake news. Its not possible.
---
But have they not fixed so that if you DC you will be able to skip q?
---
Pretty sure most people have  been stuck in a queue then just giving up and playing for like an hour before work in the morning.
---
Name Res was to gauge interest? You don't think having to have an active sub had anything to do with it? Hmm... An open 1 day stress day may have been a wiser way to gauge interest, but then - you know - no $$$.
---
10k now, was over 20k last night
---
We’re trying to play as a group of 4. Myself (Warrior) and my boyfriend (Rogue) and two friends (both Mages).
---
Unfortunately the 2 friends are both ditzy idiots who aggro mobs constantly and barely know what spells they have.
---
Should one of us (me or my bf) re-roll as something else for our own sanity?
---
Cheers mate.
---
Aubergine is the UK version of the word
---
Yeah I haven't gotten past level 6 on Gehennas EU. Between the massive queues and the layer crashes throwing you back into them I'm quite thoroughly tilted. The launch has been orders of magnitude worse than anything I ever experienced in vanilla through wotlk.
---
Now I have to contemplate changing realms despite having to leave behind friends (who are getting further and further ahead). Though just giving up for a few days and doing whatever else would probably be smartest.
---
All in all I've gone from full launch hype to almost none.
---
Way too soon to tell tbh, I think A LOT of people will quit once the hype is over. With too many servers there would've been a bunch of dead ones.
---
Many times when Questie gave me these issues, /reload solved them.
---
Where are you getting 8 hours from?  It’s been out for over 37 hours.
---
On flamelash?
---
8 hours since release? It's been like 37 hours
---
But you have to pay for 10 accounts so all the extra gold you farm is lost in maintaining those accounts so the net result is the same whether you play 1 or 10.
---
I just vendor it all. CBA to monitor AH prices and I don't imagine I'd be able to sell that much leather at the moment anyway. Anyone who's bothering with leatherworking while leveling has got to have enough brains to just pick up skinning and get all the mats he could need by himself.  
---
I mean, I'm only level 16 so don't know about higher level zones, but there are always plenty of dead beasts lying around in both Darkshore and Loch Modan. You need leather you just pick it up off the ground. Haven't been to Westfall yet but I can't see why it would be any different with all that pig slaying going on there.
---
You’re getting the real experience anyways. The water is so much better in vanilla imo.
---
You can, but there isn't really much point as a mage.  You will wanna mana dump and drink after almost every fight.
---
Priests need a wand as their rotation is shield, dot and then wand to death.  If you try wanding enemies you will find it extremely slow and painful.
---
Yes I understand that, but another layer or a 6 hour long queue? I mean we are paying for this service and there are queues that lasts over a day..
---
Trust me, I wasn't a fan of this layering-thing when I heard of it either, but now that it's there I think they should atleast make use of it to give everyone a smooth ride..
---
Now i think you don't quite understand. Of course is about number of character logged in at same time... that's why i would split in 2 (or more) server that load characters information from same database... Queue has nothing do to with maximum server capacity.
---
This one of the counterarguments I use when people say SS is always easier so not using it is dumb in every way.
---
Thanks for showing me my theory was right.
---
110% it won't be turned off within a year. There, easy.
---
There is nothing wrong with using a quest helper addon in classic. I played classic back in the day and the majority of people used Thottbot to get help with quests. Questie is just a quicker thottbot.
---
demon taunt is fucking amazing lol
---
&gt; Maybe I just have to just push through queues until the initial hype has gone down since Lucifron is 100% the safer bet in terms of population.
---
Well yea, but a lot of people think that way. There is a big difference between lucifron queues and queues to other german pvp servers.
---
So I wouldn't have my hopes up for the hype (sepcifically on lucifron) to die down. That's also why I play on dragons call now with no queues - for now, as I kinda expect it to have queues towards the weekend.
---
When I claimed and got attached to my name a few weeks ago there were only high population servers to choose from ^^’ 
---
I’m hoping that I can maybe transfer out with my friends at a later date or that other people are less stubborn and will move instead of me.
---
Haha you're on bigglesworth too? Westfall general chat was all about this conversation last night
---
You too! :)
---
My thoughts exactly.  I'll eat some awful Q times right now if I have to, because that minimizes (almost zero, really) my chances of not being on a great server later.  As you said, this isn't a black and white issue - I'm not concerned about whether I'll physically be able to play the game or not in 6 months on a lower-pop server.  Of course I would be able to.  But there's a difference between a playable realm and a GREAT realm, and the great ones are also the biggest ones 99% of the time.
---
Story, Art, aesthetic and reagon -wise BfA was the best Xpac since Wotlk. The Gameplay, daily drag and systems are hot garbage tho...
---
Thats why classic is so strong! gamplay-systems!!
---
GO FETCH!
---
Can't be Firemaw eu LUL we invite nearby players during quests, kill in silence then maybe, like 1 in 5 times, someone asks "you done?" "yeah"... then the group disbands without a word
---
I had this happen to me yesterday too, ironically, it was something like a 3k queue and 1 minute as well. Yeah, I never got in lol.
---
Classic experience
---
WOW critics already in mid season form...
---
Oh, looks like you are having a break down.
---
I await the day that 80% or more are using some kind of party finder and people like you whine all day about it ruining WoW while entirely ignoring that it was the COMMUNITY who wanted this and that the way you find a group has absolutely nothing to do with the social aspect of the game. But keep screaming buzz words without understanding anything, I am sure that will help.
---
Absolutely not
---
Some are in competitive activities or looking to be a server first at this or that.
---
But so will everyone else!
---
I’ll take out a holiday next week.
---
The queue is ‘only’ 30 min long when everyoned at work/school. ;-)
---
Then I’ll get to level my main, haha.
---
I guess Blizz will open up transfers within a couple of weeks, because by then the ‘turists’ will have left.
---
It's been over 37 hours since release
---
Downvote. None of these servers are going to die and anyone who thinks they are is obviously not paying attention. Blizzard specifically has said time and time again that the size of these servers is massive compared to before. They could lose 75% of their pop and still be high compared to vanilla standard. So stop being fucking stubborn and go to a lower pop server.
---
Having a server where you can just press one button and instantly join a raid group to kill a world boss that’s already at 5% health when you join so you only have to tag it with one auto attack to get the rewards is retarded.
---
Yeah, no. Blizzard screwing up and me wanting to make sure that I have a decent server to play in 3 months isn't selfish. It's just common sense.
---
Last night my GF got disconnected and could get in within some kind of Grace period but 3 of my friends couldn't even though they immediately tried to get back in. So not sure.
---
I wouldn't change realm if i were you, things will calm down eventually and you dont wanna end up on a less populated realm.
---
It was a 19K on stalagg yesterday, my guild ending up switching servers... again.
---

should be doable i remember re-speccing quite a lot even with duel spec back in wotlk.
---
can you only re=spec once per month?
---
I joined Fairbanks early on in the day and it wasn’t bad but after about 5pm it shot up to  hours in waiting,  blizzards issue is Adele’s right now and people trying to abuse a situation where they never get logged off
---
Thanks dor for the big red arrow, it's almost like you knew I have downs
---
thx still had me confused and laughing for a sec haha
---
Hmm, I suppose it's difficult to transition to such a system then.  I'd have figured they'd have adjusted to modern tech by now, but probably is a huge effort to do so fully.
---
Yeah I have tried, sometimes it fixes it but a lot of times not. Hopefully they have a better version out soon.
---
THE DAY HAS COME MY FRIENDS, NO MORE TITANFORGING, NO MORE PERSONAL LOOT.  FUCK YEA.
---
Then you see the one person on your server with Ashes and are like ZOMG... or the people with a nether ray grind.  Jealousy is something that allows players to strive for something, but to give it easily is lame as hell.
---
Now you can literally ride Deathwing around Azeroth how pathetic is that?
---
We did it, Reddit!
---
I love these dudes. No starting zone feels more dangerous than Silverpine "Spookyville" Forest thanks to these roving meat grinders. But, totally understand the frustration hahaha
---
I think you may be missing the point.
---
I'm simply suggesting opening an overflow realm, basically instead of opening Dreadmist for instance, make a Firemaw [2] instead. You let people on Firemaw transfer over to it for free if they want itially. 
---
You won't be able to freely swap between them, It won't have the same toons, it'll basically be an entire new realms with the caveat being that it Will merge into Firemaw once the population on both have died down. It's nothing like layering at all IMO, it's essentially another realm that's pre-destined to merge. The only other caveat could be that potentially they work it out so you can't have two of the same names so people don't end up losing their names later down the road but that's extra work for them for little pay off.
---
As stated, if they could simply bump up the realm caps by another 30k I think they'd have done that already.
---
I am a generous god
---
who the fuck cares, lol
---
I am lvl 12 mage. Only upgraded arcane spells. Played without fire blas, frost nova, and improved frost bolt and fire ball. Didnt realise that skills were listed by talent tree and not by lvl... Mage was my main but you forget some things in 15 years.
---
No wonder I found the game harder than I remember (It is still) but loved every moment so far. It feels great to be back.
---
they are all using multiple people to play 24/7.... so why does the record matter...
---
True
---
You do lose place your queue if you log in to a realm instantly, yes. I should  have mentioned that
---
Seems like this would be an issue in either case? Wouldn’t trying to teach them be a more efficient solution (provided they are willing to listen)?
---
I am not triggered at all asshole.... ;)
---
Hey you could probably drive them there and make it back in time, just drop them off at the ER with a note that says "in Wow classic queue". I'm sure they'll understand.
---
Well scummed, my friend.
---
You are the worst lol
---
There are people in their 30s. Saw a screenshot of some people doing SM. However it's been way more than 8 hours since release
---
Yes but they supposedly fixed it during the night (EU time)
---
There was 7 raids in classic, no-one ever did them all in 1 sit down.
---
Still 10k queus on arugal when coming home from work. 3 hours in and only 4k queue left.
---
It only happens for &lt;30s while DCing I believe.
---
I got 3 at level 3
---
Thank you, ill check that addon out!
---
inbox is full because there's more leather where that came from btw. what y'all know about leather?? they call me the leather legend ya dig
---
those are the same people that buy macbooks for gaming and take screenshots with phones. Pepeg
---
That's awesome
---
Some of use have already moved several times only to be met with 10-20k queues. Every server Europe has massive queues.
---
Will definitely become an even bigger shitshow than it was the last 36 hours.
---
Makes sense.  Don't think ill be wanting to log in to retail for a while. Thanks.
---
How is spamming on discord better?
---
We had a quest help, catographer, gatherer and some other shit too back in the day.
---
If you don't like it / want it, don't use it.
---
I had a wonderful deal the other day. 3 linen bags for 6s! 
---
I jumped on that shit so fast lmao
---
What server?  No server right now has a queue and it’s 7:40 Eastern. Not even Herod or Skeram
---
&gt;there's more to gaming than raw efficiency
---
Yes, and that thing is fun. People may have fun in Classic, but usually don't consider ALL aspects of Classic as "fun". And asking randoms for direction of every quest surely isn't fun for many.
---
They’re all bad, except for the brand new ones (for a few hours).
---
Just get used to queue, log in before going to work/doing chores
---
I’m playing a rogue, I have kick but it’s futile cause it misses so damn much lol
---
Same 24900 position yesterday . evening time!
---
I do remember queues being quite long around BC release, although not nearly as much as now. Don't recall it being a problem for a long time though. I guess weekdays will improve first, and then weekends later on. I think I read a blue somewhere, that 7-8k was the largest queue previously seen.
---
I entered queue 4.15pm yesterday, 22k in line. At 11.30pm I went to bed, being at around 7k, so yea, I feel your pain..
---
Sincere question, what server(s) are the ones with queue problems? Is it a specific region? PVP? Or is everyone trying to play on the celeb streamer servers? Haven’t had a problem with Myrzael yet.
---
what does that forum link say?
---
Still a dick move. Someone could be playing instead. 
---
I logged out before work even tho I can do the same from my work laptop, so someone can play instead.
---
Next week, if not the week after that.
---
Wow,such empty
---
Weird.  I downloaded game yesterdsy picked old blanty and started playing immediately.
---
Yes, Blizzard just felt like screwing the EU and did a random server restart. Just for the heck of it, you know? Let Blizzard do what they do and stop complaining about a small server restart at the launch of the game. Jesus, everyone always complaining at every single little detail that doesn't work towards their own favor. Can't login? Go do something else. Think I like that I'm in a 20k player queue? Of course not. Am I going to cry about it? Nah, I'll just go do something else meanwhile.
---
Nice, will try.
---
No discord.  Get that shit the fuck outta here.
---
I was still drinking Rank 1 conjured water and was thinking to myself "...damn, I didn't remember it taking three buckets of water to be full mana this early on. I wonder when I'll finally receive rank 2". Later at that mage trainer: "Wait...why is there no future rank 2 upgrade, only rank 3?!?!?!". Turns out I already purchased it but totally forgot to replace rank 1 with it. Welp, at least thats a very accurate classic experiance for me because it was exacly the same 15 years ago.
---
Post on the wow forums:
---
&gt;&gt;I expected to open a stream and find 50 people standing around camping for a spawn to appear, but of the streams I've seen this isn't the case. What happened to the tidal wave of players that was meant to hit wow classic servers?
---
It's so easy though.
---
They did. They said you wont have them in classic
---
I know! I’ve already made 2 friends which is 200% more than I’ve made since wotlk. I realize this is silly and probably sad to some folks but I dunno it’s the people that made this game fun for me.
---

\*cries in Germans as he see a RP Server\*
---
The weekend will be a horror for you.
---
This is one of my main draws for playing classic. I remember the sense of community way back when, and how people got reputations on their server. I'm very interested to see how the modern day Warcraft player will adapt to this. There is very much a mindset of "Well, screw these guys, I'm never going to see them again" that comes with cross realm activities, and I think a lot of people will have to change their mentality if they're going to be successful in classic.
---
Time will tell :)
---
I made a char on Mograine to prepare for the future but I've barely played him so far- queue is around 6 hours for me now, and about 10 hours in the evening time.
---
Lucky boi
---
They did. They said token won't be purchasable through classic, but you can buy em on retail and thus fund your sub.
---
It's been kind of odd for me. Yeah, it's the game I played in 2004. It's nostalgic, sure. But I'm surrounded by new games, systems, VR, etc. and I look back at this and... it's just the same game from 2004, why is it so popular?
---
well, i think that OP cant even make the addon work, and is just salty for people that do.
---
Thank you for this. #SaveTheBears

I promise you it will be, with Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon being more or less unplayable.

yesterday i queued onto Skeram, got hit with a 10k queue. About 3 hours later i jumped ahead to 4.5k, and my estimated time was 80 minutes. I thought, "oh great I'll just take a nap and i can play this evening"  
---
90 minutes later, my estimated time was still 80 minutes. I was in queue for 5 hours and the closest I got was 1.9k  
---
...needless to say I got up at 4am today to log in when the server was *only* at medium pop
---

Someone get this man a wand stat!

---
&gt; Well if this hold true in September we should expect a change as they’ll recognize the revenue from all the resubs this month and will be able to buy the additional revenue. 
---
Nope.  They're not going to act on a few days of results, because they're paid not to make these silly claims based on a small sample size.  They'd wait to see what happens two months in.  If they invest heavily and then end up seeing 80% of the people wander off, or even half the people, then they've just wasted a bunch of money.
---
&gt; I would tend to shy toward this being a marketing ploy
---
Keeping limits in place helps with that as all the talk of queues makes people assume the game is super-possible (see this topic), which makes more people want to see what it's about, so more people pay a sub, sign up, and add to the populations and queue times, perpetuating a short-term cycle that'll last long enough for the gaming media to find the next "big story" anyway.
---
The statement was regarding level 10 and that only 30% of all trial accounts go past level 10, and it was back in the end of Wrath.
---
 [https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/11/70-of-trial-players-quit-wow-before-level-10/](https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/11/70-of-trial-players-quit-wow-before-level-10/)
---
This isn't true, I was on a low pop server, it's now full. The servers they made after that are now full. People are moving, there's just so many of them.
---
Eventually the player population will calm down. At the moment the only way I have been able to play and complete quests is within a group though...?
---
Sylvanas is way taller than the usual Night Elf though.
---
Ultra wide monitor too wide I want to move my bars and use custom ui. Unplayable smh my head
---
Layering permanently &gt; not being able to play with friends at launch + friends quitting before starting + cumminities broken up + “healthy server size”.
---
It’s 2019, and some changes needs to be considered from 2005
---
I'm level 7... but my fishing is 75!
---
Did they up the spawn rates? I swear they spawn faster than in the stress test
---
Most likely because sure it would look good now tons of people playing from a buisness view but what if those numbers suddenly go down a lot? like it most likely will then it does not look that good anymore.
---
What you're suggesting is unbelievably stupid, to the extent that I don't even know how to respond to it. It's far from practical. The status quo is what it is; I can't make Questie disappear. 
---
Think of this issue more theoretically. I didn't come here asking for advice how to reconcile my dislike for Questie with the current status quo and somehow try to adapt in practice. No, I meant to discuss the issue from a "third person" perspective.
---
I don't know why the guy above you is so harsh...
---
But I also always said DM east, west, north, tribute...And Deadmines was always called VC on our server, because the last boss is called VanCleef.
---
In my head, it's Deadmines or VC for short, but I'm probably in the minority because I never heard anybody call it VC anymore.
---
It's probably one of the most interesting instances pre 60 imo, such a cool place. The boss room with the boat and stuff completely blew my mind, after spending hours getting there it felt like such an epic adventure. I still have vivid memories of it 14-15 year later, can't wait to go there again.
---
Neither your brother nor bad at pvp. Just a few more misconceptions you have. Your hostility is pathetic tho, have a good day.
---
Learn from your mistakes, i say that. You can respec, but it costs a lot of gold ( increasing everytime you respec) and money ingame is hard to come by. BUT!
---
You can't REALLY fck up your character while leveling. I'm  building a Subtetly rogue ( it is mostly pvp spec and utility)  which a lot of player say is crap for leveling. I just don't care, i want to stealth around and pickpocket things because i imagine my character like that.
---
QuestHelper existed from the like 2 months into vanilla... whats changed exactly?
---
Average queues for the few different servers my friends are playing on EU all seem to be above 12-15000 people after about lunch time each day...kind of nuts also from a consumer standpoint we are actually paying for these days we can’t use.

Warrior
---
Just solo then seems like your only solution
---
Pls go to BFA again :(
---
No it will not yesterday I had a friend at work so I opened a second client and logged his account so he could start making his way through the que and then we he got home and logged in it retained his spot so this means it holds your spot by account not ip
---
Pro Tip: set up a remote connection to your home computer and randomly check queue times before you leave work by logging in to your home computer ;)
---
When i got home yesterday, i was #22 in queue ;)
---
Bruuuuh....... kinda disappointed in this pink stuff.............................
---
Plenty of servers have little to no queue. Play on one of those.
---
Medium servers were a bit more than two hours.
---
Source: I joined a medium server and it took 5 hours..before I loged to go to bed
---
But that wouldn't work because then people on Gehennas (1) can't interact in any way with people from Gehennas (2). Things like the auction house, partying up, sending mail; none of that would work if they did it that way.
---
You realize I was making fun of you, right? *whoooooosh*

Well you must be exxagerating, because this is not exactly true. I am not saying this is the worst launch, I totally understand what Blizzard intended with the initial amount of realms and layering. Yet, things didn't work perfectly. I for myself have been pretty unlucky with queues, resulting in maybe 2-3 hours played. But I can wait a few more days until things relax.
---
Still, certainly not the best launch ever.
---
If you expand a server with layering, and you put, say, 2x as many people on a server, it's going to be tough to remove layering by the end of phase 1 (which they promised).
---
Tell that to firemaw
---
First from shazz to gehennas, then gehennas to firemaw and now we’re on razergore. Won’t change again tho no matter how long the queue

Orädd and Xrewz lvl 36
---
Just skipped breakfast to set up teamviewer in a rush before leaving for work. Priorities are in order, tonight is the night I get in!
---
iim 10+ and havent had 1 drop ;/
---
I use atlas loot to see the loot in dung / raids 
---
Gatherlite to remember where i gathered before
---
Im only tied to the server because im lvl 20 on there, and i dont want to start over. So i would only switch if the qs persisted for the next several weeks :))
---
Yeah you're right. Once/if the queues die down I'd be going back anyway, so it's better to take a step back to prevent further tilt and maintain some tiny degree of excitement.
---
awww so cute :3
---
Ew bleh!
---
I think it's even better that everyone is broke too. Some kind soul was making bags for people at cost (with mats). I give out health pots for free now, gotta pass on the favour!
---
How is that outdated? Looks pretty accurate.
---
I'm on the PVP server also but i'm stuck at work for the next 5 hours or so &gt;.&lt; I think my character is level 9 atm but i'm splitting my time between playing retail and classic as i'm abit of wow noob apart from a couple of binges to 100 on EU.
---
NICE you go spacegoat
---
&gt;&gt;And asking randoms for direction of every quest surely isn't fun for many.
---
That's gross exaggeration, and you know it. Only a mentally challenged person would need to ask for directions for "every quest".
---
First time I’ve played classic and you’re absolutely right! The game just promotes interaction and I love it.
---
I boosted a character for retail and got to 120. I ran dungeons and literally didn’t say one word to anyone the entire time.
---
How do you get graphics like this? :O
---
I mean, I guess. But like, there's not even that much good shit to buy in classic with gold. I was a priest and picked up enough money just from doing level 60 dungeons with guild mates for gear and the Omyxia key quest to easily be able to afford shit I wanted. All the good gear in classic is from dungeons anyway.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Jesus holy wall of text.
---
If you believe using add-ons / help is garbage this game isn't for you.
---
After reading through this post it just seems like you just want to bitch because it ruins your Immersion and / or because people don't play the way you do.
---
The games 15 years old dude, all the info is out there, up to you to chose it or not and tbh.
---
If you wanna play the way without add-ons I'd guess just group for the elite quests and do your own thing like the rest of us are.
---
I cried to this one
---
Probably confused with druid :D
---
I know exactly what you mean, before Classic I was the only person I knew who still played WoW, in the past 2 days I've made 4 new friends and joined an amazing guild of friendly people.
---
Even in barrens it’s really rough. And I’m on a medium pop server
---
Sucks that all my friends have the week off and can play. And here I am at work...
---
Why can't they do it like retail EQ and allow it for some servers and disallow for others? Everybody is happy that way. I wonder how easy integrating something like truebox or similar would be.
---
Enchanter profession dungeon run to the trainer.
---
BRD key/MC key/UBRS key/Onyxia key runs.  No shortcuts!  (Or Brewfest drills).
---
Running to BG camps in Ashenvale and Arathi for BG rewards.
---
Scholo key.
---
Mount faction grinds.
---
Sooo many grinds...
---
Profession recipe mat quests.  Ugh.
---
omg i didnt saw that lmao, ty very much &lt;3
---
I legitimately laughed out loud at several of these.  Thanks for this.
---
Tuiki ui and questie only add on you will need
---
good for you mate, don’t let them rob you of the community you wanna play with :)
---
I don't get the get warlock clock things.
---
Hahaha indeed! Though shamans apparently have huge mana issues as well :(
---
That literally sounds like it could be made into a WoW Machinima its hilarious.
---
Bye don't come back
---
Yes but ques mathematically effect people with less time to play more. Let’s say you have 4 hours to play a night and a no lifer has 18. Let’s assume you face the same que of 3 hours. Suddenly the casual gets 1 hour to play. And the no lifer gets 15, the causal loses 75% of his play time and the no lifer only loses around 16%.
---
But then we wouldn't have wanted BFA :) This way we bought BFA and still play Classic. Who is comming out as winner?
---
What if it goes beyond week 1? I think a few of us are concerned that maybe the hype drop off won't be as big as expected and that blizzard has no real solution to the server ques.
---
Am I supposed to just reroll on a new server next week to avoid the que AFTER i'm already level 20? Am I supposed to start my profession grind all over? What about my fishing and first aid? 
---
What about my established guild, am I supposed to tell them they wasted their time on this server?
---
These are my concerns. I don't need an answer now, but I would like to hear/see a gameplan from blizzard about this.
---
Everyone who complains about long queues is kinda dumb. Take all the time you’ve wasted in queues by now and you could easily get to lvl 15-20 on a normal server. The argument “but all my friends play there” doesn’t really count because your friends are kinda stupid not to switch as well.
---
There literally no reason to endure this queue madness, folks.
---
Are you using chrome ro control your hone computer? How?
---
Well I tested it yesterday, and it does not support G-keys
---
How?
---
It was like sandpaper in my pp when the nurse pulled it out. She couldn't have done it any different, just a smooth gentle pull :/
---
No problem, have fun!
---
I stumbled upon a random RP event in Razor Hill last night. It started as a fighting pit under a tree and ended up with two different groups getting sent on tasks around Durotar. It was very well done and really enjoyed watching it, almost forgot that I "wasted" an hour of questing just hanging around Razor Hill.
---
Other than that, the same as everyone else been pointing out. People crafting bags for the materials, offering to trade starter items (wands and gear) and most of all: a VERY active and friendly chat. Couldn't be happier.
---
huh blood elves? I hate that guy!
---
Hey no worries at all. I don't mind. I just know not to waste CP on switching targets now, that's all. xD
---
Yep, I moved from a "Full" server to a "Medium" server about 3 days before launch and now it's also a Full server ("est 280 mins wait").
---
Normal folks with work or school will either have to wait (a month? 3 months?) until things cool down, or just toss their progress and reroll on a new Low pop server.
---
This is genuine heart warming wholesomeness. I miss Metzen.
---
Your warrior is not a true warrior if he forgot that.
---
I wanna tank like a madman so i can wear all those gear sets. Even if i cant find a raid I'll at least be able to grab the dungeon set and have fun learning all the 60 dungeons again.
---
Very accurate.
---
Honestly I’ve had my moments where I needed that button when I started flying and forgot to pick up a quest, train skills or AH etc and just wanted to get of quick instead of flying all the way to EPL or something from IF.
---
Oh sweet summer child welcome to MMO launches.  Sitting in these queues is a Badge of Honour.
---
It's not even a bad launch.
---
You get the opportunity to /spit on their corpse.
---
Yeah we're not even going to try to play at this point and reroll again Friday on a fresh server of the day.  Though I suspect that won't do much good either as more will join this first weekend.
---
Actually it's anything that burns you. I think you can even cook in lava &lt;_&lt;
---
I know what you mean, I always feel bad for not being able to reciprocate with the buffing so I normally try and give away light armour kits from my leatherworking as a thank you.
---
Yeah that's the only time I see it. I don't think I have ever seen it happening for long periods of time. How would you even make it happen?
---
Blizzard seriously underestimated how much people would want to play Classic over Modern WoW. BfA is hands-down the absolute worst expansion in WoW history and the classes have really stagnated over time with no real meaningful class changes to the talent trees, they do remember is in an RPG right? The removal of gear sets removes end goals for gear and use of titanforging devalues the gear that actually drops. Gear from a heroic dungeon can be just as strong as keystone mythic with the right titanforging buffs and that's insane. Blizzard won't really care right now, they are still getting the subscription numbers  but when the next xpac comes arround with merchandising/mounts etc people won't buy it and then they will care. They will also care when people get as far as they can with Classic but realise they hate Modern so they drop off altogether. Without actually listening to player feedback during beta and making meaningful changes ncluding ripping out most of the timegating and world quests, modern WoW is doomed.
---
You lost me at 'if I wanna play alliance.'  
---
: runs away yelling "For the Horde!"
---
I don’t understand how you can ignore the thousands of people with 3 day /played 60’s..
---
3 times here...
---
I really doubt it
---
You know how easy it is to bypass WoW afk check? Easy af. Just create simple program in C or Python that presses (through driver not software so it's undetectable) few buttons. Randomize this is and you won't have to sit in queue ever again.
---
Honestly while waiting in queue you can easily learn basics that you need to do that. It shouldn't take you more than 4 hours if you know nothing about coding. I recommend python it's easier to use.
---
Taking pictures of your PC in 2019 LOL
---
Like into a wall?
---
It's pretty bad on Zandalar too, Nixx and Tali already have member capped guilds and you can see people spamming for invites to their layers.
---
Yeah, people are forgetting that "Low" and "Medium" are dynamic in regards to what the highest server pop at the time is. That is why we are seeing queues for "Med" pop servers and such; the demand on High servers is so large. Think of Medium servers with a queue as the old vanilla High servers.
---
Classic is a trash game.
---
Yea. You keep thinking that. Retail is the real trash game. Have fun with whatever you like playing. If you dont like it, keep ya fuckin mouth shut. Nobody gives a fuck.
---
I had 12k/7hour queue OFF peak hours in a medium server...
---
Kromcrush represent!  Finally got in there last night to play for first time after multiple asinine waits in Stalagg queue.
---
They've said that all layers must be gone to phase two, when world bosses will appear and people will start to try and game the system.
---
75 servers get free server teanfer so they can move players or they can make 1 server from 3 servers.. not that hard from pount of IT..
---
Yep! With a simple extension;
---
[https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/) 
---
Seems to work like a charm, and I figure it's even slightly playable for simple tasks
---
Chose to play on THE ONLY RP server in NA, my queue was 14 minutes.
---
Compared to the literal tears I got when I saw my beautiful old cat form model?
---
Nah, I think you're a fucking tool.
---
How are the AM log in times? Maybe I'll just wait a few weeks. Don't wanna be in queue for so long =\
---
*Whoosh*
---
Grab that candle with both hands!
---
Hi, so I am starting a great adventure that is classic. However I am torn apart between warrior and mage. 
---
I have read a lot about both of them and know couple of their pros and cons.
---
I heard warriors are pain to level up but I will be playing with a friend (rogue), so that might not be so bad. I also like to tank (only tanked in retail so I have no clue how hard it is), so might level up as arms/fury and switch to prot at 60.
---
However, mages seem to be all around “good”: Utility, damage, farming. They won’t be so popular(which for me is a good thing) as warriors, which a lot of people take. They also don’t require equipment from raids to perform very well. 
---
Please help me pick one of those classes. (and also if warrior, what spec is the best to level as?)
---
Yeah same, my work computers Teamviewer license didn't support the newest one so, had to use my phone.
---
name does not check out.
---
HES FARMING ON RETAIL.  THE SUB IS THE SAME.
---
I saw one of the two gnomes that helped me kill Vargash stood outside Ironforge about 3 hours later. Stood and had a 5 minute conversation with him while his friend was bio breaking. Literally saw his name and recognised it straight away.
---
Third party programs might get you in trouble. But an oscillating fan with a spoon taped to it will not.
---
And titanforging and sharding and mob ilvl scaling and templates and legendary rng and class missions. All of these things don't feel like they belong in wow
---
Logs and dps meters existed in vanilla too. I'm not even so worried about end game since it'll be forever before I'm there, but even just leveling instances it's like "No thanks, have 4 hunters already"
---
Stopped playing once cata came live
---
This is why i am trading random ppl in stormwind and enchanting their gear. And not charging 1silver to make linen bags. (In both situations ill level my profession so it is a win win).
---
Ahh damn everyone has the same idea. At least you can make food prior to the big grind
---
The problem with rerolling is that the currently full servers are the ones that will last the longest with sustainable populations once most people unsubscribe, which will inebitably happen.
---
Don't forget the in-game queues for quests!
---
And fireslash, still waiting in a queue now and have been for the last half an hour
---
Aged perfectly. Blizzard is so smart, they are setting this game up for long time success.
---
Until you fly from Org to Silithus and realize you forgot something. Saves you on really long flights where you gotta go back for something for a silly reason.
---
Everyone has been nervous about every new server that's opened up but look where we are.
---
allright
---
The all totems button wasnt added until wotlk i think
---
Anything specific you want?
---
You could potentially macro this to happen.
---
Alternatively there's the self cast option that If you cast a non-harmful spell and target an enemy it will selfcast.
---
Its something along those lines you'd macro in, I don't remember the specifics since macros have changed a bit over the years, but a modifier:selfcast should for sure be within the possibilities of macros.
---
I'm sitting in a lecture atm, but can definetely look into this later on when I have a pc on me.
---
Hope it's what you're looking for
---
Layering is to limit the effects of overpopulation on playing. I.E limit the number of players in the same area farming the same mob.
---
worked for me... 90 minute queue last night, got dc'd about 15 minutes after getting in. was expecting to get put in the back of the line but got right back in.
---
The people saying classic will die soon are the people who worry about retail. 
---
Personally, I like both, but I think Retail is in a bad place now. I'd love for 9.0 to be amazing, so I hope they can learn what people do and don't like about classic and meet somewhere in the middle.
---
Whats the in game queue for? Only ever played horde.
---
I queued last night on my server. queue time said 36 minutes. came back 36 minutes later. queue time was still at 27 minutes.
---
the queue times are not accurate.
---
Yeah wait times haven't been remotely accurate either. I've sat at 70-80 in queue for over an hour.
---
Last night all but 2 servers had a queue and they were normal and i was looking for a PVP realm. So in a practical sense that is simply not true.
---
Not a shit storm but a hype storm. It's a happy and sad storm
---
Yea whitemane has 0 que time rn
---
I get into skeram instantly in the mornings
---
Honestly no point in doing those quests just move to the next zone kill 10 mobs and you’ll get all the xp you missed
---
Kk man.. enjoy your no life... try to feel working people who want to relax for 1-2 hours and not waiting 20k queues
---
&gt;  There are people complaining they are finding it hard to get groups for Hogger
---
Really? I'm on a med and low pop servers and I'm having a hard time finding groups because there are already 5 full groups surrounding named mobs.
---
Yeah after 2 nights of dealing with que I'm just going to log on 4-5 hours early and just sit in a Inn with a auto clicker only way I can play. We even all moved to a new server to avoid it but none the less still 5 hour ques on lower pop servers.
---
So you’re saying I can play for 30 hours straight AND die.? Win win
---
\^ this is why a ton of servers is a bad idea.
---
I've been abusing this as a mage when people refuse to group. Not my fault i have a good connection to the server, can beat most everyone to a tag, and have fireblast. Sad thing is i've been shit talked for it already.
---
Yeah, if you're in Thunderbluff there isn't an engineering trainer, though there is a mining one, but Mulgore does have 1 engineering trainer. He's a goblin and you have to go through a mine filled with hostile npcs to reach him.
---
Working as intended. Most Pservers did not have correct values and knew what they were doing but made void walkers INSANLY good at holding threat when they sucked back in vanilla.
---
Gz
---
It’s really not. The giant models look ridiculous.
---
Welcome to wow classic queue where numbers are made up and your time does not matter
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Are you using life drain? The DMG + healing threat from that spell will pull agro from the voidwalker
---
Still havent got to play yet. I was 45 mins into que last night and my 18 month old hit my keyboard and sent me back to the server screen.
---
There should of been more oceanic servers from the start. As usual blizzard underestimated the popularity the game
---
Never has QQ been more relevant.
---
wtf ? there is queue even on medium population ? this makes no sense... does it ?
---
They also said you think you do but when you see the queues you will realize you actually dont! :P
---
Idk what’s worse logging in to wait in a 40k que or finally getting in and not being able to kill a single mob because of the massive amounts of people doing the same exact thing as you
---
I can live with that. I’m no longer in a position to lose time to the game as I did back in Vanilla so it’s not practical for me to get a PC. Looking to be casual/pvper anyway.
---
Uh what are they supposed to do? Add another 20 servers that no one re rerolls on because they have level 10+s already?
---
Oh yes I know, my question was more an ironic one than anything else. My point was, that layering is a measure to split the population WITHIN the realm so the circumstances you mentioned don't happen, rather than it is a measure to temporary pump a realms population beyond it's normal tresholds.That's why queues occur and that's also why they, in fact, DID open new servers and not just pump up those population tresholds, because layering IS NOT meant for that.
---
The flights in classic are performed in such a way that it combines a number on flight paths. For example. Loch Modan - West fall is really Loch Modan - IF - SW - Westfall and you used to have to click start on all flights individually in early vanilla. 
---
One reason one would use it is if you forgot something and need to get back. You can also perform this task by logging in and out again.
---
Stop doing so much dmg dot/wand shouldn't pull often. Fanning your mana out more rather than sitting every fight for water is way faster in the long run anyways.
---
Still the same.
---
Let's say the communication only occurs when you log in. You are essentially logging in on both servers and adding the queue time for both servers. In the example above, this would be the one gate for the two rides and one gate for the exit.
---
Did setup AnyDesk up in the morning, and wrote the connecting String down... but ofcourse did I forget to allow my mobile to connect to my Desktop. So when I get home today it looks like it will be another day with 22.000 queue and 9-10 hours long :(
---
I first tried Mograin (EU) @ 5:30PM BST and the queue was \~8k with an estimate for 300min, came back an hour later and it was only in 7K range with a higher estimate.  So I choose one of the new "medium" pop servers Ashbringer EU, the queue was only 3k and took a little less than 2 hours.
---
I also logged on this morning at 7:30AM BST and Mograin was 2.5k queue but Ashbringer there was no queue.
---
I won't forget some of the names. Man I'm so excited to get home and play.
---
Yes but only to a certain extent.
---
Without layering there would only be 3000 players at a time ( maybe higher idk, no one except blizzard knows)
---
But with layering for each layer there can be another 3000 ( again don’t know the exact numbers) players before you get thrown into queue 
---
So if they decide each server is gonna have 6 full sized layers that would mean 18000 players at a time.
---
If they were to make the number of layers infinite they’d never be able to disable layering by phase 2 (on high pop servers), so that’s not an option.
---
Get chores done/nap to make playtime more efficient
---
You know you're a D&amp;D nerd when you say 6th level not level 6.
---
5:30PM BST happens when this comment is 4 hours and 28 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/c1jPm4PcD
---
When gehennas queue goes down it's because the players got sick of queuing and moved. So you'll get the sloppy leftovers whilst the cool people are elsewhere on some newer realm.
---
Even queues in wow are magical
---
A month with these queues and you lose a lot of players no matter what game they’re playing
---
He did not. He was out of touch of fans of the original game and the intense social aspect of it. He made the major business mistake of thinking that there is "one perfect pasta sauce, when there are in fact perfect pasta sauces." In other words, you can have vanilla WoW flavor and retail WoW flavor up for sale at the same time, and let people's preferences take over.
---
Was absolutely certain it would turn into thedonald
---
100% this man! I popped into retail a while back when my Classic hype began to intensify after not playing since Cata and couldn't believe that was a think. Absolute turd.
---
were on our 3rd, went for dreadmist this time because atm there is hardly anyone there, we just wanted to play...
---
There will never be tokens in classic
---
Dungeons is up to you. Warrior is notorious for having a bad time solo leveling. I did level quite a few twinks in dungeons almost exclusively. It's pretty fast once you got a regular base group that you run with. Ideally you have a warlock buddy that helps summoning people to the entrance. If you quest with a healer buddy you'll be both benefitting from it. Warrior does drastically more damage in this scenario, and the healer just loses a few dps by keeping you topped-up.
---
You can do well without PvP gear, but ultimately you're going to benefit from it. All sets are designed for tanking. So PvE content may not yield the ideal items for PvP. Unless you feel like tanking Alterac Valley?
---
That is hardcore
---
When trying to choose a server how do you find out which has the shortest queue if all the information you get is "Full".
---
I have multiple AddOns running, so I'm afraid you're wrong.
---
Multiple times I've seen warriors struggling with mobs, as a druid I give them:  
---
A full heal  
---
Mark of the Wild  
---
Thorns  
---
And a warm feeling when they /thank me for it
---
I met Falcorn on Zandalaar Tribe yesterday lol.
---
With Activision I wouldn't be surprised if he had to sub...
---
Dude 50g is a lot for a priest! Consider this
---
Transfering is much better is jot it ? How many times should we reroll ? I started a serv yeaterday ,today it has 7k que , i start again and again 7k que ,so when so i progress?
---
Warrior is THE most dependent class on gear. If you play solo, it would be quite challenging. You'll have trouble handling two or more mobs at once. However, if you are paired with a healer, you'll be invincible.
---
yep i got dc'd too with some error message. shame
---
Re Roll.
---
FYI Razorgore yesterday was 2 hour and half of queue at 16:00 CET.
---
I grouped up three times last night for quests. I have not enjoyed myself in WoW in years. I am a Cata baby, I cannot believe I missed out on this game when it came out in 2004. The one group, we helped a dwarf hunter tame a rare mob before traveling to Loch Modan for the flight path. I made two battle.net friends last night. 
---
I dont think I could go back to retail. I wish my guild felt the same way about how I feel about classic. Few of them are trying it out but all they do is complain about not having that "instant satisfaction."
---
Changed 3 times so far, got to lvl 20, half my group changed again for the 4th time last night and now we're wondering if we should bin the level 20s and start again. 4th time lucky?
---
This had me in tears laughing, great start to my day haha.
---
That demon taunt is on point tho
---
Bite them off
---
they have bigger problems then banning people rn
---
About 7 hours. I did all profs (fishing, first aid, cooking, herbalism and alchemy) to 75.
---
Hardest part was getting the eggs on the senjin isles, 8 or so were stolen from me.
---
I wouldn’t know anything about that lmfao :P
---
Nice try Mr. Allen
---
Ill start playing in like 2 or 3 weeks.
---
I hope this means game time bought with tokens will be super cheap lol
---
Jesus...
---
HAHAHAHA you poor thing. What was the queue like after?
---
I get that it's the same idea as superheroes averaging 8' tall - "larger than life" so to speak. But [this is ridiculous](https://i.imgur.com/FEf3Jd5.jpg). She's easily 12' tall and malfurion's like 14'. They're not giants or titans. Make them a little more imposing sure but they're not [Wun Wun](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/7/72/Battle_of_the_Bastards_20.jpg)'s older siblings.
---
Exactly!
---
Stop it
---
You dont need a reason to shit on Activision
---
Oh ouch :( my prayers of with you brother
---
Not cool to downvote just because i have a different opinion. 
---
"...sad..."
---
Who are you? Donald Trump?
---
If you live alone, nothing is preventing you from shifting your sleep schedule to 7-9pm to 3-5pm and get up in the morning to play, if you really want to.
---
I rezzed some random dude and he gave me 10 silver haha.
---
What server? I loved playing with a Shaman healer in one private server. I was Druid healer and Warlock put his SS to the Shaman so resurrection wasn't a problem. We didn't wipe much tho. :D
---
Deadmines usually requires you to be level 18-20, a level 12 is still very far from going there
---
Locks are squishy = clocks are squishy
---
Did the same, shazzrah has 525 min que atm.....
---
Yeah. I'm trying not to start too. Vacation in 2 weeks anyways. Maybe I'll start after and see. I played end of vanilla and BC through lich King.
---
Of course you can. Soon as you come near the guards they will attack and you will flag for PVP.  You wont be able to attack others that aren't flagged until they start attacking you.
---
Was doing this in barrens with healing wave last night. I'd bought rank 3 already.. god I've missed you classic.
---
I remember seeing someone level 41 yesterday. Makes me wonder if someone can get to 60 today.
---
If you ever plan on tanking consider enchanting for the trinket
---
That sounds interesting. I think different servers have different caps though
---
Molest doesn't mean anything sexual it just means harrass. Be a pain in their butt. Jerk that candle.
---
It's all EU PVP realms.
---
PVE and RP are mostly fine with low queues (less than 30 minutes).
---
Stop what?
---
When I played classic it was my first mmorpg and it literally took me a year to get to level 60! Just enjoy it.
---
how quickly you forget the massive twitter content patch
---
Watch the video here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hqKjds4LqQU
---
Work work
---
That's very possible
---
Maybe he has vip access and skips queues.
---
Talking exclusively about raids, sure. But there is so much more to Classic. They're great in dungeons and other group play!
---
If you want to tank, you really need to do enchanting up to 260. There's a BoP trinket you can make. It's kinda mandatory.  You can replace enchanting after that. Herb/alch is fine after that.
---
Dwarf warrior is awesome. Especially due to stoneform. Saved my butt a lot of times back in the day.
---
What about paladins or druid?
---
Uhh only possible if they go without sleep again lol
---
I'll just be floating over here pretending to do stuff... at least my gear matches.
---
15 hours played at lvl 15 but I took a huuuge break between. Cry. I have failed myself.
---
Same, all my friends rolled on Herod. I waited 7 hours on launch day in queue before I fell asleep and didn't play, yesterday I queued during my lunch break and got DC'd after about 20m of being online to be hit with a 10h queue and be unable to play again.
---
My guild is NOT switching and if you don't prequeue 8+ hours in advance you can't even get on at all. What am I supposed to do besides just abandon every person I know playing?
---
I'm a lvl 32 warlock after getting void Walker and a wand I have very little down time between fights  and can still solo elite mob quests. Hunters are the same way the 2 pet classes make it simple.
---
How? Ask everyone "hey, got Questie?", and if they answer "yes", leave the group? That's incredibly stupid for reasons that don't even need explaining.
---
been playing with these people on K3 and LH for almost 4 years now, i know more than 30+ people rolling there and most of them are people i talk with regularly. Also, my irl friends have their friends there too, ex guild mates etc so we decided that the queue is not enough to keep us out.
---
o7
---
It will be again. It has the best location hands down
---
Alternative solution without having to remote: There is a grace timer on leaving and rejoining the queue. If you start the queue on your work pc and leave it on when you leave work, you can log into B-net at home and jump right into the spot you were in before.
---
Hey... are you a FedEx truck driver?
---
I had a situation on launch night where we had to hold a FedEx truck
---
Imagine getting triggered by a "humor" post
---
I didn't buy BFA and I'm currently playing Classic.
---
RP servers tend on the community side and be friendlier than others. But they also tend to have a bit more drama. People get whiney over the dumbest shit.
---
Maybe but also they did a few things in recent years to make it more reminiscent of Warcraft 3, dialogue boxes with the character's head talking was one thing, making the "heroes" huge was another.
---
Cue the corrections.
---
&gt; I hear they're hard to master and easy to mess up
---
It's correct that they are hard to master, but they are really easy to learn the basics of.
---
Try to learn it at your own pace. You will make mistakes (forget to bring ammo to dungeons or pet-pulling half a dungeon) but you are not the first nor the last to do them. Mistakes will happen, and you'll learn from that.
---
I highly recommend playing a hunter as a new player.

* Questie (where are the quest mostly, coords).
---
* Bartender (light addon to change size and move skillbar, remove background skillbar too)
---
* Recount (dps/healmeter. Pretty useless so far, will be usefull endgame)
---
* VendorPrice (vendor price displayed on items, very usefull when full and have to drop items)
---
Also, i'm still looking for something to have a better questlog.
---
TukUI
---
Yep. Reminds me of my EQ days where I would help random strangers out. Throwing out heals to save a person and buffing people with Power Word: Fortitude that do not have it.
---
Yeah, im aware i go for the frost spec. I am just wondering, wether i chose things like frost bite, as some people say it will mess up AoE farming, and what talents do i take in the arcane spec?
---
Low servers are still massively more populated than a normal realm, plus they're almost certainly going to have to offer free transfers from the full realms before phase 2, I wouldn't worry.
---
Still, these are problems worth fixing.
---
A problem can be solved, and this one is worth solving
---
Would be nice to even get to see it at all tbh. I'm sure everyone will have a mount already by the time I get through this queue...
---
I feel that those who won't hold out for the queues probably aren't sticking around anyway. The game requires a bit of patience whatever.
---
OMG so much yes. I do this to everyone, even druids if I see theirs has run out. Also random heals
---
Smart
---
this is literally what sharding is, and nobody fucking wants it (for good reason).
---
I had a 3700 queue yesterday that took over 6 hours because I almost guarantee tons of people are using anti logout macros while they sleep. I rolled on one of the "lower" pop US East pvp servers (they are all full but this one hit full more recently, so I assume its less people).
---
depends on the keyboard. I can set mine to not have a long press but many small presses.
---
As someone who has roleplayed in Stormwind City quite a lot, and just generally run around it for many hours on end, it was refreshing to see it in its original state again.  
---
I've still not gone into the original Park, I don't know why not but I just haven't. I look forward to seeing Loch Modan again too. :')
---
Or people stop playing every day and play every other day. Or instead of 20 hours sessions just 3 or 4 hours.
---
People will quit, people will play less. It happens every release. Be patient
---
Yeah. Afaik explanation has been that players will more easily spot important NPCs. I understand this in raid environment where visuals might easily cover if boss is normal size but I really dislike how in story events my Tauren is like half of size of Jaina.
---
Well by that logic, just don't play the game; won't have any queues then.
---
to be fair though....that doesn't prove anything besides that loads of people "think that they do"
---
let's check back in a few month, that will give us more information if it is "but you don't" or "and you really do"
---
Yea with such groups of friends I see why you'd do it, otherwise you'll probably end up re-rolling eventually anyway.
---
Hi there
---
So much this. I get a grey piece from a random mob drop that has more AC then my current gear and I get hella hyped. First time I got a green I was over the moon. Just feels so much better than retail in so many ways. Every tiny accomplishment feels like a real victory to be excited about
---
I tried it, no idea if it worked, don't see much improvement tbh, also no idea how to check :P
---
Your numbers are off. It's been like 38 hours since release.
---
Thottbot yo. Thats my excuse to look stuff up.

Your fiend is hilarious. Thanks for sharing
---
Non-stop, back to back.
---
Due to internal spell scaling, no. I tested this in advanced shaman guide part 2
---
Exactly. Just look at how much faster they’re beating super mario bros these days
---
Too complex and finnicky.
---
Except literally every person on this subreddit is going crazy about their Herod queue.
---
Okay but bfa had massive login queues on launch and now everyone hates it.  Launch week isn't much to go off
---
I am triggered
---
Game isn't sport.
---
I was just joshing the dude.
---
Hmm is this new?
---
nah, it's actually the best thing
---
Slight hijack: I've got a level 14 mage, so what should my rotation be? Should I just spam frostbolt or should I mix in arcane missiles and fireballs?
---
Sigh... why not just make a second discord account and screen share.

I think the definition of "day-drinking" varies widely. As someone who's personally trying to stop drinking.... a beer at lunch is not "day-drinking" in my book. And day-drinking liquor is just asking for trouble.
---
Yeah noticed something was up this past week. Items put up for copper instead of gold.
---
Let's be honest mate, it's a cat. Even though you wouldn't be able to prove it was intentional it would definitely find a way to cancel and exit game when you were like number 10 in the queue.
---

Let people play at whatever pace they want. Stop acting like somebody is better than somebody else because they choose not to sleep for a week to get to 60. Vanilla is about enjoying the leveling experience just as much as endgame.

Same on Blaumeaux. It’s really weird that the normal mobs seem to have been accelerated for spawn rates but named  quest mobs have sometimes 5-10 minutes to respawn. It’s probably that the original mechanics were never designed for this kind of volume. Though more aggressive layering could have solved that. I was playing in barrens yesterday and while it wasn’t completely unplayable like the starting zones for launch it was definitely difficult in some areas to even tag mobs that you needed.
---
And to think there are those of us that haven't even been able to log in yet.
---
Thx for the info :)
---
In the grand scheme of things, a couple of weeks is not much. Classic will live for hopefully many years to come!
---
With this set-up he can 'solo' farm the late game Dungeons for both tons of raw gold and by farming Orbs/Elements etc which ultimately cause value inflation (not to mention he will monopoly over certain BoE or rep-locked recipes for a while), once he farms said Dungeons enough his mages will have BiS pre-raid gear which means he can then sell the accounts.
---
To be fair, this is the “you think you do stage”.  We are all hopeful, but I’m nervous what the world looks like in 6 months.
---
ctrl-prtscrn
---
Same position as you OP. Though none of my guild mates or my very own brother will join me. Alone I am
---
Farm devilsaur leather before the zerg arrives and make more gold than they'll ever need.
---
As much as I hate the wait and the Ill preparedness, it’s great to show the world how right we were about classic.
---
This is just launch.  Lets see in 3-4 months.
---
Was decided on Priest, but now my friends have chosen Horde (I am still on holiday), so Shaman is once again on the table. 
---
Which would you recommend? Looking for a pleasant levelling experience, open to healing dungeons and the occasional MC at end game (so which is more fun?), but will mainly PvP. 
---
The 30/0/21 spec really appeals to me currently..
---
Hands down? That's a bold claim. There were only three raids total, only one of which was great. No mythic+. Tanaan was the worst iteration of timeless they've gone. I'm not seeing what you're seeing.
---
I mean 80% of the chat last night was in pure spanish, 5% was russian and 15% was people trying to convince everyone it's an english server and for the overall feel it would be more enjoyable if everyone spoke the same language in general/trade chat.
---
Paladins can tank most 20man content and are very useful offtanks in all raids up to Naxxramas. They don't have a taunt but there aren't a lot of fights where you really NEED it, plus that's what warriors and bears are for! Warrior is naturally the best main tank though. 
---
If you raid prot be prepared to heal once and a while too when your tanking services aren't required. Also either pick up engineering or find an engineer with a EZ thro dynamite because that's the best way for you to pull groups. Happy yanking, friend! :)
---
Haha saameee
---
"Get back here and let me love you, you beautiful bastard!"
---
Yes! And actually having to read your quests and following their directions.
---
He is using bartender for bars, portraits  can be moved without addons.
---
Like I said we have 5 Servers all full... Maybe your friends are but mine would like to change so we can all play togheter... I wouldnt eant them to change too if they would make a new server because they already played for hours... Would be selfish of me ;)
---
Probably ElvUI
---
Average is about 12 tops. 2 days isnt too late to reroll
---
What’s it mean?
---
TeamViewer is free. I personally use splashtop but that costs 5 dollars for a month subscription.
---
Any cheap laptop with a dedicated video card less than 5 years old will rock it.
---
This right here, made me burst in laugh!
---
Haven't you ever heard the term "queues draw a crowd"
---
It's literally just marketing. If you think it's so bad how about you unsub instead of bitching on Reddit while still giving them your money?
---
Please downvote me. I promise itll make me less correct and you less salty. /s
---
Because it reads as "kay", at least in my head.
---
It's literally not a title. You're not a 'watcher' for catching a movie once every month, and you're not a food conniseur for eating daily.
---
Did my first 3am stay up late. Paying for it this morning
---
What does weather have to do with easy mode?
---
:o
---
Well done, have /spit macro under your ambush yet? ;-)
---
¿Que?
---
so you could say that... classic leveling is a just a grind?  
---
and then you grind even more in raids?  
---
wow dude so different
---
Honest question, why do I feel like a lot of people poop on Paladins and they aren't popular Classic?
---
I find the lack of comments on the sticker with bearded female dwarf disturbing.
---
And then re roll again when that server is full?
---
How is the population on alliance side?
---
If you use Google Chrome, they have a Remote Desktop extension that works really really well. I've been using it for years.
---
Then unsub and come back when the queues have died down. No one is forcing you to sub right now.
---
Don't use it. Keep it.
---
Sell it when twinks hit the scene.
---
One thing i'm loving so far in classic is that leveling is a journey not an obstacle. 
---
Having these quests for feats like the voidwalker or hunter pet shows that.
---
this time "Make Warcraft, not love". Since now we are adults now and this time we knew very well what we were getting into.
---
Lol yeah been playing since yesterday non stop super hard to lvl Bc there are tons of people doing the same quest
---
The corrections are queueing up in here.
---
That is a fair point. I almost always played melee in retail (warrior, rogue, DH, DK) and prefer that playstyle, but wouldn’t be a big deal to change it for a „fresh” approach
---
Sandstone drake?
---
Hell no, I’m in the bed crying.
---
What region are you in?
---
same for java
---
A lot of NPCs now have even their own phasing, so players phase in and out as they get a few feet away from them. It's insane.
---
Yessss
---
set my alarm to 8am CEST to start queueing and go back to sleep so i could play at 11-12am. i felt quite betrayed when i was able to login instantly.
---
If you want to discuss the topic perhaps do something else than slam the addon completely and try to understand why people use it. It's obbious it's not ruining or destryoing the game as everyone and they're mum were using quest addons in earlier times as well.
---
Awesome shot. I definitely got the tingles when I first saw the ramparts of Orgrimmar in Durotar after you emerge from that canyon north of Razor Hill. Wild how emotions work. See you in WSG!
---
Staying on a 5 hour queue server would've been the mistake.
---
I don't get people who insist on staying on a full server for some reason, when you're hyped about the game but you'd rather wait in a queue than play on a low pop server , it makes no sense.
---
homie google is your friend
---
I have ADHD and I love classic. Would take it over retail a million times over.
---
Is Darkshire, well, dark again? Can't remember when they changed it, but I remember it being much darker at a stage - added to the ambiance.
---
After not playing at all yesterday because of the wait. I decided to do just this today. Only to find out my pc went into sleep mode and i have no way of waking it up.
---
It’s ridiculous the technology we have today is not the same we had in 2005.
---
Blizzard has made way to much money not to have insane servers.
---
Put your money where your mouth is.
---
 /spit
---
Dude same. I was telling a friend of my launch experience and how chaotic it was and that I loved it so much. I love the newness of it and the fact everyone is a new low character. So much fun!
---
Cool, that's what I needed to hear. Thanks mate!
---
Literally the only thing people are complaining about is the queue time and lack of foresight to have prevented it.
---
Pets can eat other players?
---
join a guild filled with teenagers. you can raid with them when they get home from school.
---
Every day I log in and my estimated wait is about 2 hours.
---
I waited 4.5 hours the first night and only got about half way through the line (7k in front)
---
Last night the initial que was lower when i logged in and when I had to give up 5.5 hours later I had 13 people ahead of me.  That 13 number was stuck up there for awhile without moving so it's not like I was close. Lol
---
I always thank a healer for saving me. A druid definitely saved my ass just last night.
---
But, to all the mages, priests and druids who give us those drive-by buffs as we pass, we may not get a chance to say "thanks", but we are all thankful!
---
Depends how much you define a couple - world record is in single digit days.
---
Oceanic down
---
So true
---
Story? Are you joking?
---
Yes you are going to get in trouble... the community will hate you for it. You will flood the market with single stack garbage. Don’t do it.
---
Wait. You have a queue right now? What server?
---
Can’t wait to be working remote again next week so I can just start my pc at 2-3 and queue up...
---
It is but it’s not, I am just really happy, had tears in my eyes the whole game, and I felt like a kid again.
---
Had this happened to you within the last 12 hours? Because they said they would fix it
---
True, so is YouTube but everyone seems to say different things, wanted to see what people thought here.
---
Yeah i know i feel so bad for my guildies but i try to enjoy myself because if im not then no one is because our discord is the moans and cries of those stuck and purgatory and if no one is having any fun it may as well be hell itself lol
---
Well that's true. But don't you have the possibility to go on a low population server? It's probably your own decision to play on the one that is full. You have the ability to play for sure, but you choose the server that warned that could have massive ques. So in this case, they ain't owe you shit.
---
A few weeks for the enough people to reroll somewhere else, it's not going to magically reduce itself u know :p

---
This isn’t ‘allowed’ but iirc blizzard can’t really find out if you do it or not
---
add-on
---
Haven't installed it yet, but I think its called enemy cast bar.
---
"I also think if blizzard had called "medium" servers "high" then nobody would be afraid, even though they had the same pop. It's all just in peoples heads."
---
I've thought about this a lot. Like, if Blizzard put out 4 new servers, then an hour later 'made' them read as high population servers, people would be less hesitant to start over on a 'ded realm'.
---
Thanks mate,  I didn't know how to add these tags!
---
All of my friends have sadly started playing on the server we chose, so now it's impossible to convince anyone to move.
---
Then there is me, stuck at level 1 and yet to even log in for the first time.
---
Things will die down next week I hope.
---
Finalyl got dc'd from Uiamba, stuck on retrieving realm list however
---
just happened to my level 7 character, hopefully it’s a server issue
---
yeah, it's crashing all over the place. As someone that's now experiencing their first time in WoW classic, is this the WoW experience I've heard so much about?
---
I still haven’t even gotten in lol. I enter queue right when I get off work and it’s been 20k+ both days. I’m not bothered cause I know it’ll die down and I’m not in any rush to play, but I’m surprised they didn’t put more systems in place to handle this. Hope everyone is having fun!

---
Whilst playing last night, my friends list was lighting up with people I haven't spoken to for 8+ years. (Last time I played) Good time had by all, I just hope they can sort out this queuing bullshit.
---
It's not prices, it's exactly what you said after that: the combined price of all things on the AH. This drop could be because prices are dropping or because people are playing classic and not using the retail AH, causing a drop in overall items listed. The second seems more likely to me. Could be wrong
---
It actually helps with how fast you gain weapon skills
---
It's a label that you and others describe you with, and that label has connotations. 
---
For example if I called you a troll you wouldn't most likely like that very much thanks to all negative connotations attached to it. 
---
Just the same if you're called a gamer it's usually expected that you engage with the larger gaming culture and know more about gaming in general than your average person.
---
That’s ultimately what I was thinking. Graphics/CPU recommendations?

Tauren are 13 percent of Orgrimmar's population yet commit 50 percent of the crimes.

No they dont.

In WC3 all heroes were bigger than regular units and it was fine  
---
&gt;but m-muh rts needs more visibility  
---
they also had huge glow auras around them. Size was not just for visibilty.
---
I'm surprised so many do, only because I don't.  Played it back then, have no desire to do so again.  It's pretty cool watching even from the outside how many people are playing it and watching this sub for the memes and fun everyone is sharing.  Curious how it'll look in a month or two, what with a lot of people taking time off work to play, and they'll inevitably spend less time playing WoW and more with their familes after a week or two, plus all the people that never played checking it out for the first time - it won't be for all of them.  Still, happy to see how popular it is, though it's a shame they stuck with the server technology of 2004 (I know a lot of fans demanded they do so), as it's keeping people from playing.
---
You could make this argument for any add-on. You are at a disadvantage if someone uses auctioneer and you don't.
---
SOrry man but how do you move portraits without addons. I am really dumb
---
My friends got bored of queues so they moved to the recommended server at the time (Mograin, or was it migraine?). Now, queues..so some of them moved to the next recommended server, now queues..one of them moved again, queue.

Having the same issue on Yojamba and Arugal. Maybe it is an Oceanic specific issue?

Gamers like to min/max and exaggerate. Hyperbole has been normalized within gaming discussions.
---
Something that's considered good might be called "overpowered" and something that's not perfect might be called "complete useless garbage".
---
Since Warriors are the slowest class to level *solo*, the language used to describe their solo leveling experience is outlandish and exaggerated just like everything else in gaming discussions. It's not nearly as bad as people claim, it won't take 10x longer than a Hunter, but it *is* slower, so it gets blown out of proportion.
---
You will need to do both! They are designed to not have enough quests. When you get to an even higher lvl you will be going to almost all the zones in your appropriate lvl range. Heck I even had to go to loch modan cause westfall wasn't enough.
---
jokerd did not get any help? He is mob grinding, ofc he's gonna have enough gold for mount.

yeah same. Joined the queue at 5:15. I feel your pain buddy

Same problem here.

I'm seeing the same on Remulos

Ha i tanked RFC yesterday and first time going in was like “oh, this game  has been out for so many years, this will definitely go smoothly”. Cue dumb hunters continuously pulling agro. I mark skull and x and these get completely disregarded. Extra mobs getting pulled due to general stupidity. Was an absolute blast

I'm over the moon the game is popular as hell right now but this is gonna be a rough few weeks.

You should read more on google about shot rotation. And yes you can leave the mark on fast killed mobs, only dungeon and raid mobs will be marked. The reason why you dont mark is mana efficiency.

Go hunter bro, given how fast you went from proper speech to downright laziness ,I highly doubt you'll have the patience to stick to a warrior all the way through.
---
You're absolutely right. I'm having a blast levelling in classic right now just like literally everyone else. Give it a month or two and a little time at end-game. People will realise it's not that great in 2019. It's just a fact.

Blizz has been pumping out new servers to meet demand. The problem is people can't imagine starting over after working so hard hitting lvl 3 or getting an "awesome" name.
---
I spend about a month carefully playing footsies in bed woth my partner so i dont gouge the fuck out the back of her calf muscles, then one day i usually kick my toe on somethin and it sbaps it in half or so, then i just rip the bugger off.
---
As the guy said, right-click on the portrait&gt;move frame&gt;unlock and then you can drag them wherever you want, right-click on the portrait again&gt; lock, so you won't accidentally move them.
---
Essentially that's what we'd be doing. Convincing our guild of hundreds and all of our real life friends that are 15-20 levels in to jump ship.
---
Yea I ended up waking up much earlier than normal this morning and decided to see what it was like. Pretty much every server was low, a couple were at medium.
---
I played for about 20 minutes and really relished that time and then had to leave for work. Not looking forward to the queue times when I get home from work.
---
I cant believe i never realised this after all this time.
---
That's a horrible way to think about it. 4 hours a night to play wow isn't the same thing as 4 hours a night to sit in the queue after work and not get to play wow.
---
There are a very large number of people with appropriate time to play the game, without the time to sit in the queue as well.
---
You defending blizzard? You stupid or something? They moved servers. There’s still queues. He could have moved servers every single time one of the new ones came out and he would STILL have long ass queues. Get real. This is NOT his fault and it’s certainly not his fault for not wanting to restart he progress over and over again.
---
Just now Shazz had 16k. Yesterday it had 24k for me.
---
After lvl 10 it gets easier I assume
---
Press O.
---
Create a group. 
---
You're welcome.
---
You are right. It's a good message.    
---
Even just sitting for so long for days isn't good for your health.
---
Why is Fairbanks considered the Boomers server? I’ve been hearing that a lot in game too.
---
The hard parts over.
---
Even her boobs are smaller...   Wait, what?
---
I did just that, got 75 tailoring almost instantly. Then made a couple of silvers as well from people who didn't have no linen to give ;)
---
okay
---
Ye seems busy from horde side as well, lots of people spilling over from the busy servers. 4h hour wait times are insane man...
---
Just yeet them through portals. Simple.
---
Looks like a huge waste of time. Skip
---
Go learn mining and blacksmith. Forge some weapons for yourself. Maybe that will help.
---
I said this exact same thing to my friend last night.  In 30 mins on classic, I interacted more with other players than in the last 3 expansions combined.
---
Yup, I've been playing EQ on P1999 for the past couple years so just like the first time I played it Classic WoW seems like a breeze in comparison
---
He's 100% getting help. Warrior leveling is masochism incarnate.
---
So true! So many people in /1 asking questions about mechanics that are very different that retail now.
---
6:00 wake up and take care of baby
---
8:00-16:30 work
---
16:30-22:30 que
---
22:30 sleep
---
Because they’re able to be on when I’m not able to. And are still on when I’m able to be on.
---
I doubt I’ll ever make it to 60, so I picked based on flavor, and as soon as I log in people are talking about how bad my class/spec is haha
---
Thinking of getting a second account to roll on some other server while waiting in queue on that server.
---
Click the arrow next to Play and select classic wow
---
I am an actual geologist. First time I saw this episide I nearly wet myself.
---
starting areas are fine. queues are still horrendous.
---
Cauthonluck ended his stream yesterday on level 35
---
-cringes loudly-
---
I thouht hes gonna be harder, he just died as the second adds spawned and I got to heal A ~2 times
---
Transfers wont fix this.
---
Better planning would have fixed it but at this point it's too late. 
---
We need to wait it out and after the dust has settled maybe there is a point for opening transfers.
---
I'm talking about 3-4 weeks from now.
---
55-60 is where the real hell is. No more quests, pure grinding.
---
Dude those first shoulders, tho
---
Dude there is a big difference between just being wrong about something and being wrong about something while simultaneously being as condescending as possible. On top of it to talk down to a customer asking a reasonable question as politely as possible at a business conference?  
---
Guy wasnt just wrong hes likely a piece of shit to work for and with. What an arrogant fool.
---
This was by far the best thing iv read all day.
---
Hahahahaa  Ty for the great giggle.
---
Yeah I'm basically a demigod in retail. In classic I'm just some hobo with a magic wand and a pet imp.
---
Screen shots, forum posts, talking shit in trade chat until everyone knows your name.
---
No achievements.
---
This is good. I actually had a thought like this yesterday when I'd see unskinnable mobs.
---
I can imagine blizzards office:
---
"Sir, there are currently 150k players stuck in queues, we need to do something."
---
"If we let them be the will give up and the problem will solve itself."
---
"But sir, they've been queueing for seven hours straigt and are showing no signs of stoping."
---
"..."
---
Linen bag on my server costs 4s on ah. Not very much
---
The Archdruid Bearmantle (i think his name is) is scaled up a little actually.
---
Hi guys! Completely new player here, intrigued by all the hype surrounding Classic, and want to get involved. This might be a redundant/impossible questions - apologies if it is, I don't know what I'm talking about - but are there any servers that would be ideal/are designated for for new players? The idea of discovering the world/content with other people seeing it for the first time would be really cool. I'm guessing probably not - but thought there'd be no harm in asking! I'm also EU.
---
Thanks guys.
---
Take skinning, skin EVERYTHING you can. Sell the leather to a vendor. PROFIT
---
Mate play whatever you want to and i doubt you group will care as much as you think but i personally would stick with Pally for there high sustain and high group utility. Pally's have a slow grind to level 32 but after that its smooth sailing as you pull multiple mobs and build reckoning stacks. The major cons are that low mobility, slow leveling, and are very vulnerable in world pvp.
---
The excuse is that merging is not something they want to do. Merging servers is not some "200 IQ" move which saves everything. There's still 2 economies getting mixed. Duplicate player/guild names. And if all realms gets merged as if it's 100% certain, then people would plan accordingly to level faster and what not.
---
Making more servers fixes queues but certainly makes new issues as well.
---
ah i get you. i wanted to main a healer for once but it'll see what level 60 content is like before re-speccing.
---
Planning to level as shadow and just heal dungeons when i can
---
10-20-30 IIRC
---
Always have time for metzen.
---
I logged into Incendious at 4:30pm EST last night, jumped into queue then went grocery shopping, did stuff around my apartment, cooked dinner, ate,  watched some stuff on YouTube then an entire documentary on Netflix, took a shower, did some writing, realized there were still over 1000 people in front of me in queue, went to bed. Classic is really fun. Can't wait to play again today!
---
God I want a game with the combat style of Tera/BDO. (over the shoulder aim your abilities).
---
Only 5hours played due to queues..
---
Is there a reason for starting with auto and not with arcane/serpent?
---
Auto starts automatically right after arcane/serpent.
---
Looking at her just makes me think of how they ruined her in hots
---
Look how they massacred my girl!
---
Don't all employees get like 10 year sub cards?
---
Might as well reroll somewhere else i guess, lvl 10 is still nothing to worry about, at this rate you'll hit 10 again before it's your turn in queue.
---
No. Wait a few weeks at least. We haven't even hit 48 hours yet. Calm down
---
joker is dinged 42
---
I still use my netherwing drake on retail. I love it too much, don't care if it's ancient.
---
Some are pretty cheap on the AH on Stalagg
---
Instantly died after this picture was taken lol
---
That's what people tried to do. Krom had no queue when they rolled. When I tried to get in it was 8k. And do you have any idea how hard it is to coordinate moving 40 people or asking people who've been up all night playing to quit and re-roll on another server? And then they find out that they're rolling on another server with a queue. So they're pissed now that they're waiting when they could have just kept playing Stalagg.
---
If I were playing solo or with a single friend or two, I wouldn't care either. But trying to server hop to avoid a queue with 40 people spread all over the country is not feasible.
---
just tried to log into herod and its 8:40am and theres still a queue of 1000 people lol
---
Same
---
Yeah you're right but for 10 years 1st thing i do when create new char is remove auto att from cast bar, i cant explain why it bothers me that much :D
---
My Ques are my burden :( haha. I knew what was gonna happen when I got on Herod...just didnt know it would be 6+ hour Ques :D
---
I don't get it, sorry. Hard cap, let's say 50k, is easy: realm Full -&gt; character creation not available, as always. 
---
About the merging.... if 50k total character but only 5k average login at daily peak on the 2 server -&gt; servers merge. If any time the daily login mean grow again it dynamically fission in 2, on server 1 queque start forming? -&gt; people log in server 2.
---
i thought they pulled back on that after the backlash
---
Starting areas are still inundated on many servers.
---
Queue is bad on any popular or “old” servers.
---
Yup... took a few days off work... up until 2AM, up again at 8AM, need to log in and play!
---
I would say when it comes to mail casting gear, yes. When it comes to rings, neck, cloak, trinket you will compete with the other casting classes. If you go enhancement, you will compete against Hunters and Warriors, especially with weapons.
---
It’ll die down cause a lot of people are joining the hype but once they actually start playing classic and realize how different it is now from retail they will go back to retail. Though from the looks of it blizzard won’t add enough servers for all the people who actually want to play classic to play soooo...
---
I still haven’t been able to start lvling. At 6-7am est there isn’t a queue in any server, but I also have to work so I can’t play.
---
Those benefits were TBC era. For my rogues, I kind of like alchemy, because I’m already buying vials.
---
Yeah that’s what they all say
---
Also, stop stalking my history or I'll report your ass dude ;)
---
That's some bitch ass shit.

we were bunch of levels 18 trying to have fun running first dung in classic. we were not trying some crazy ass classic thinking there, just fun :D
---
Yup!  It’s a bit of a long chain!
---
Fuck. Westfall.
---
Explain why them deciding to do one expansion forces them to do all of them? Ultimately it’s up to the player base. If people want BC they’ll do BC, if they want Wrath they’ll do Wrath. If they don’t they won’t.
---
I am save. As long we dont get a RP Server for the german com i dont play. But thx man! And good luck back
---
I'm using gathermate2 and it's fine. Virtually no difference.
---
What about people who enjoy pushing M+ and doing mythic raiding?
---
😂👍
---
I honestly am running both, priest when playing with my wife, and mage for when i'm playing solo....both are lvl 10 now so idk how much experience i can tell you, but the priest has been more fun, but the mage is much faster to level

---
Or just have 0 friends. Works for me. Everyone I know is on the same server and plays at the exact same time. We always have the same quests and the same ideas. It's perfect.
---
And here we are using a separate system outside of the game to talk about the game.
---
For me it's the classes. Everything feels the same as the other, just different themes. Nothing feels wholly unique to a different class. Everyone has typically the same utility, everyone has gap closers and stuff. I just think it's boring. They don't feel fun to play. I haven't come across an azerite piece that really changes anything about my class other than adding some RNG element to it or "this activates to increase healing, give you a shield, or do dot damage sometimes. Others your stats boost."
---
It just feels so lack luster to me.
---
I'm not moving because I'm fucking level 20 and don't want to feel like I just wasted all that time
---
Maybe if you had better friends they'd move servers with you ;)
---
I usually just disable it, reload, re-enable it, reload. That fixes it.
---
They're gonna make you not want it
---
Your point?
---
Are you implying that endgame content somehow *isn't* the game in classic? Once you hit 60 you're no longer playing the game?
---
I planned this out and so far it worked. 1 day fully ugly off work addicting gaming with 2h sleep breaks in between. Then in the evening I was so fucked up that I went to bad happily and now back to work.
---
So far my genious plan.
---
Too bad my 1y old decided to go hyperactive this night so I barly had any sleep... here I am fucked up at work but it was worth it :)
---
You can also just use the auto-walk function ingame..
---
hey hold up, the LFG add on ban is a good thing.
---
Most WoW veterans would agree. A very small minority of the population want this feature.
---
It encourages social interactions. Yesterday, after running RFC, I added people to my friends list for the first time in a long time. Mainly because if I need some eager grinders, I can hit them up again.
---
Although I respect your opinion, don't spread false information like "everyone's suffering because there's on LFG" because it's just not true.
---
Probably around noon
---
I've seen people state these "facts" for months now yet the game's popularity is proving them wrong day by day. I doubt that'll change in a few months.
---
Of course there will be drop-off, but I think there will be less than people think. There is a reason WoW used to be the most popular game around.
---
mage alt here, i'm a priest main with tailor and enchanting, and i can't figure out what professions to take with my mage...i'm thinking just mining and skinning for monies, but i'm not sure
---
Idk why you guys don’t just start on a new server. If you’re saying you’re still a low level just start on a new server.
---
I got into queue at 3:30 yesterday I went to class and then the gym I ate took a shower and sat down at my pc at 10:30 ~1k left so I logged off and went to bed.
---
Shaman, druid, and Priest would be the healer/dps classes. Priest being a bit of a pain to level up solo.  Druid and Shaman both are fun solo though, so whichever looks more like what you want.
---
Yes and so everyone starts multiboxing and ruining the game. I want to keep the experience and not have this shit.
---
Maybe we should like, play classic for a while first, you know. The game that released two days ago.
---
The most important part of classic dungeon tanking is to communicate. Make sure that you clearly tell your group to not attack until you have built some threat. Mark targets (Skull is commonly used as the first-to-kill mob, with X being second, moon being sheep, etc.). Use your threat building spells like revenge, sunder armor, battle shout, etc. Taunt doesn't built threat, it just makes the mob attack you instead of someone else for a few seconds. But yeah, I guess you know a bit about the spells. So my main point is that you have to communicate. As tank you're pretty much group leader. You tell people when and what to attack.
---
It does doesn’t it? I’m 33 and feel it too. It’s this sense of insane community like we all belong together and are all in it together and we are all friends already. I already made like two new friends in my first few hours
---
Bye.
---
Play on a server that doesn't have a 20k queue you idiot
---
My friends are on Shazz , my character is lvl 20 , that's a days playing basically. Yes, if you are new, don't join the queue, other than that your comment is retarded.
---
A priest will get a spot no matter the race honestly. Play what you want.
---
Horde or ally?
---
A night time slider in the graphics option would be easy solution. Proper dark nights is what I loved most of classic.
---
Wtf, Tyrande been on the steroids?
---
No, it just makes you an asshole because if you bought multiple seats you might as well charter a private flight or something to that effect. Second, the availability of flights is much greater than queue times currently are. And finally, flights are considerably more cost prohibitive than $15 a month.  That person would deal with the social repercussions of this, much like the multi boxer saying how often he is flamed. Using a pragmatic example of an obese person or a pet is not the same because there is by definition a need for that, whereas a purely recreational game there is no need.
---
They announced that Full now means there is a Queue to log in.
---
Interface  Options&gt;Camera&gt; Max Camera Distance
---
NE gets dodge chance, it's a nice bonus but weapon skills from going human are more valuable since threat generation is always something you can improve upon.
---
Wait, wait, wait.
---
You could just open another desktop. Windows key tab or someshit. Can remember the exact keys
---
Hey so basically you move forward with W and left and right with Q and E while turning with your mouse (to allow your fingers to hit abilties ect ect)
---
this method also frees up A,S,D in a nice row that you can keybind your abilities to for ease of access :) 
---
people often keybind Q,E,(S if they can learn to unbind it) but it's very benificial in my opinion, how often do you walk backwards really! if you're just starting i'd set it up now and play for a night so your musce memory doesnt mess with you!
---
Same here, gehennas was fine at 7.
---
If they got half a brain anyway. We will see.
---
Might have to find an Expert Tailor
---
Lmao.
---
oh that is so typical Danes. he´s saying sausage boy, for no reason at all it seems
---
Not just peak leveling, but end game Best-in-slot.
---
But y tho
---
It really isn't this difficult, download chrome remote desktop on your computer, download it on your phone and sign in to beat the queue when you're at work.
---
My friends chose the realm
---
Your English seems great though, by the way.
---
Yeah, just select the option "Only show content I want to see" in the settings.
---
Yea, and I think you're a pretentious asshole. You have the impression that you hold the universal truth, and everyone else is doing it wrong. The reality is, people were using quest helpers way back in vanilla, and having a great time, so you are factually horribly wrong. Stop being an asshole. Your opinion is like a dick. Its ok to have one, but its very annoying when you whip it out and start waving it in everyones face.
---
Maybe at level 65. Get that trash outta here.
---
Don’t want to play without my friends
---
I totally forgot recast find minerals was a thing, I haven't done it the whole time I've been playing, just assumed it was so busy there wasn't any about lol, thanks.
---
Leveling is harder, end-game PVE content is definitely easier just because Blizzard was so new at raids and bosses.
---
WHITEMANE GANG. WE WILL NEVER MOVE SEVERS 8 HOUR Q TIMES EVERYTIME WE TRY TO LOG IN. WHITEMANE GANG
---
That's how I felt. When I was about level 20, TBC came out and I didn't get much from Classic. I am very happy to experience the world events and raids again.
---
/aap skip 
---
With that you skip whatever AAP is telling you to do and moves to next line
---
&gt;Because of this most games these days are very accessible and easy to get into regardless of how much time you have to play, which makes it more appealing to a wider audience but in turn makes it less appealing to specific audiences that have more niche interests.
---
I find this somewhat ironic from blizzard's perspective, since as a casual I'm enjoying classic much more than I enjoyed BfA.(I quit WoW somewhere in early cata, gave it a shot in BfA again)
---
BfA constantly has you do all these activities and bombards you with daily stuff...it's exhausting. I can enjoy classic at my own pace and everything feels meaningful, a lot of items have constant value and can still be viable at higher levels. Various on-use items and trinkets come to mind(magic dust, sticky glue, tidal charm, ...) getting these feels great no matter where in the journey you are.
---
While blizzard definitely favored mass appeal, I think part of the blame goes to catering to efficiency. A lot of the stuff we did in vanilla was very inefficient/time consuming...but because of it you had a lot more social interaction and community building.
---
Because that's how it works on live? You can't buff NPCs, including pets, but on Classic, pets (both hunter pets and warlock demons) can be buffed. :)
---
See I have the same problem. I want to RP when I feel like it. Being on an RP realm makes me feel pressured to RP all the time and that's exhausting for me.
---
This isn't a what I should play, but what should I pick. I have the option between a +2 Agi cloak, or a +2 STR +2 Spirit cloth legs. I am a rogue so the armor rating on the pants are much lower at 24 compared to my current 46 armor legs.
---
I wish I could commit like that.
---
We haven't even hit 48 hours. Calm down...
---
Don't forget those ugly Sky Golems. (puke)
---
The big thing is people can stay logged in to character select screen for a while. Log in to a character log back out and stay in character select for hours. From what I remember it was initially a 30 minute kick off timer but idk if that's still the case. A lot of people are starting to use remote control from their phones while they are at work to get into queue while it's low and stay logged in all day via character selection screen.

---
11k took me 6 hours yesterday, just fyi.
---
I'm at 1000 (from 5600) right now after 4 hours, and it's moving Very slowly
---
The raiding and dungeons in BFA were as good as any, much better than classic imo. But the loot, the progression, the lfr, the raid tier systems etc etc made them feel a chore.
---
I think i've learned something today... thank u sir
---
Should've picked more sharp-witted friends then. Enjoy your queue haha
---
Yeah I didn't think there was anything else skill wise, I do appreciate the advice though. I'll definitely have to start marking targets. It was just never really an issue before, I personally don't think it's that hard to notice which mob the tank is attacking.
---
I'll definitely concentrate on increasing damage output. I appreciate the advice.
---
Last night on Old Blanchy it was just a mosh pit of people mashing tab and attack
---
You can do that now with team viewer. I boot up at about 3:30 and login. Don’t get home until 5.
---
It has nothing to do with what I want, people need to be willing to be disposable when there's a ton of hard gear-checking boss fights. This isn't retail, if your tank can't handle a certain boss they won't until they get their gear on point. If you need to burn a boss faster, you won't be able to "talk" the dps any higher. It's worth a couple tries, but people need to understand when it's not worth the time.
---
&gt;In modern WoW, it makes sense for many people far too often to disband and restart after a single fuckup without communication
---
Maybe if you're not doing the end game content. Good luck chain disbanding mythic content.
---
Why would it change? Levling is slow as shit yes, but if it's fun then so what?
---
&gt;  unless people start rerolling
---
and only very few give up
---
atlas
---
Shadow Priest is more compelling end game, mage is easier to level and are PvP gods. I'm not a big warrior guy personally.
---
Keep you ammo and bow updates with your lvl u will se the diference when u hit crits of 70 at lvl 11
---
can you do that inside taverns and vendor shops?
---
Youre one level away from the greater magic wand which is a big upgrade. Just get that one. I've seen them going for 20s on my server in chat.
---
I've been waking up at 5 AM and playing until I have to go to work.
---
I have entire zones to myself *and* no cringe meta humor in general chat.
---
No, it's just masochism. "It was so much HARDER when **I** did it." It's a warped nostalgia. 
---
They banned it to prove the improvements they added to the retail game smooth out the rough spots.
---
imagine being a priest and having a tagwar with literally anyone... It's goddamn depressing :(
---
Priest healed himself while you had the aggro. Healing creates a lot of threat in vanilla
---
It's not like we told Blizzard to add more servers for months or anything. Oh no.
---
And even morrowind was pretty "dumbed down" compared to daggerfall
---
That is the table desk lap thing from Best Buy!
---
Do I need to buy stable spots?
---
Lol yesterday I was looking for a guard in org and got confused why saurfang wasn't giving me directions until I realized who he was
---
I have a nerve damage and so plan to play with dualshock 4. I would say 80-90% PvE and occasional PvP. I haven't even chosen a sever yet.
---
I definitely should stick to something easy with very little micromanagement. What should I play?
---
okay, didn't know that.
---
Some hide them in the interface options
---
Lmao SERVERS ARE STILL PACKED ARENT THEY?
---
Lol okay, go play a mage right now while the hype is up. You won't last.
---
You had a grace period? Damnit man...
---
I got dced for like 1 minute, logged back in... Looks like queues back on the menu boys.
---
That is a fair point. This has got to be one of the most "dangerous"/"ragey" communities possible though, if Activision start mandating microtransactions/wow tokens be put into classic they're going to get absolutely destroyed by the community and people will flock back to private servers.
---
Not that I totally put it past activision to try it anyway, especially when they see how incredibly well classic is doing compared to everything else that blizzard does right now
---
By simple logic. The OG servers have the dedicated players who paid extra to get a character name while the new ones will house most of the tourists. Also realm memes.
---
You can be that guy that refuses to tank. But you will have a much easier time if you just tank when the group needs you to. You don't have to be main tank. You don't even have to spec out of dps spec to off tank. 
---
Warriors scale the best. They will be top damage when you have good raid gear.
---
I agree, but you also have to mention that FFXIV has that node system that allows you to easily teleport anywhere within the city.
---
I didn't say grinding didn't exist, but there are goals and accomplishments to be had along the way. I've been in so many BFD failed runs in vanilla but it would be a failure of astronomical proportions to wipe in any non-mythic+ dungeon in BfA. You had to coordinate where people stood in Gnomer so that they didn't pull half the instance thanks to a pathing and LoS ~~bug~~ feature. A lot of the grinding is at end game, but in BfA leveling is just a grind. No thought, no accomplishments. You don't even need good gear to be OP while leveling. Do you know what leveling as a holy pally is like in vanilla?
---
They're two very different games and I understand that there are people out there that like the optimizations, the comfort, and the balance of retail. Personally, I've tried to like BfA so much but I just don't. Maybe it's nostalgia or maybe it's being old and crotchety, I can't say for sure but I think it's because the leveling experience just feels more rewarding.
---
The queues are already at 16k by the time I'm getting to lunch. Either everyone remotes in or a ton of people have taken time off to nerd out completely. I believe it's a mix of both.
---
You have a good point though.
---
My RP EU realm is still low pop...somehow!
---
I would have 3 gold too if i wouldnt have bought all the green equip for my mage :'D
---
It looks like OneBag3
---
aw seriously
---
Did you try jumping on the wheel? In pservers you could cheese it by jumping on the big paddlewheel just down the ramp if you had Aggro on the adds, they would just stare at you because they couldn’t path to you and not switch targets. That’s probably an exploit so don’t try it lol
---
Priest is better for total healing numbers
---
My memory failed me! 😩
---
Although as selfish it may be. This is the toxic environment that blizzard created due to lack of planning and community out reach. 
---
Down with the blizzard sympathizers!
---
Dude.. vien sur Stalagg! On est tout le temps 150+++++ online dans la guild RAGE
---
That's exactly what I've been doing.   I work graveyard at a doggy daycare and have 4 hours every night to wait for the pups to wake up.  Prime wow time!
---
&gt; because we loved leveling
---
you were definitely in the minority. Leveling is one of the few things that retail does better each expansion. Leveling in vanilla is fun right now because nostalgia, and for outliers like yourself. But few people are going to want to do it 2 or 3 times.
---
Yeah you're completely missing the point and I'm not going to continue talking to you because you're clearly a man of very little intelligence. Enjoy your Discord goodbye
---
I do not. I could be using an ahk but I don't for a few reasons
---
Demo Warlocks for raiding: Thoughts?
---
Dude OP burned your ass. Sit down
---
So Whitemane is the meme server but are people goin alliance or horde? How’s the overall server population?
---
Why we dont have free transfers then? We dont have that at all!
---
whats the thing that you liked the most playing Rogue?
---
Will it though? I feel Chain Heal can rack up some HPS, plus totems are a massive boost. 
---
But Priests have Renew, Shields, potentially a better PvP spec (Shadow) .. aghh..
---
Thank you for the kind words, I really appreciate it.
---
But that takes time too, especially when you want to go back. It also doesnt cover moving from/to darnassus.
---
Baine is just casually in the middle of bloodroot, nowhere special, just by the big pole
---
Yeah I think 14-15 is the sweet spot

A VER PUTOS, YA ES LA HORA PARA FOLLAR
---
I'd like to know as well, 13 priest here and my buddy is a lvl 1 mage
---
Gotta have that DnD baby.
---
It's just that he voices Thrall so it's hard to picture him as anything but
---
Yeah when Eastern Kingdoms went down Monday that really made my guildies salty. I was cool dropping 3k in the queue though
---
Easily yes. You could even have a somewhat decent desktop setup for $500
---
I’d pick up a used setupmysslf, more bang for the buck. But if you’re a bit scared of buying used, I’d pick up an on sale thing from new egg. If it’s got any sort of dedicated Graphics card, you’ll be good to go(wow classic can run on an integrated GPU, so any upgrade to that will be great)
---
You mean have him tag the mobs and then kill them?
---
The only downside is that you won't get XP on your own.
---
You should not group up because then the biggest part of the XP will be wasted.
---
Which is a shame for the RPers because they are probably getting a lot of people joining who are just breaking the rules and/or not adhering to RP server etiquette.
---
This makes sense since all players returning are now civilized adults.
---
OP, you have 11 unread emails. Please open your emails.
---
Maybe but we also have almost no "named mob" quests either.  That and I just don't think Tauren are that popular lol
---
Reported. You want to debate Blizzard wasn't prepared, that's fine, but don't insult me.
---
Omg absolutely.  Such a well done show.  Karl Urban is so good.
---
&gt;I know priests farm worse than mages, but I've read that they also require fewer consumables, so maybe it evens out?
---
Priests are probably the worst farming class, apart from warriors, and mage is competing for the top spot in that regards. I don't know about consumables, but at first sight it doesn't make sense, as the mage has acces to conjurable food and drink...
---
That said, healing in raids or dungeons is fun. I've never played a mage in that context, but the priest experience in group content was great.
---
&gt; Retail is nothing but a big sunken cost fallacy
---
Bingo. So many people (me included occasionally) play Retail solely because leaving 4 max-level characters feels like a waste.
---
 How is this remotely ok with you guys? Blizzard one of the biggest companies with tons of experience and tech behind them. 8 hours QUE TIME in 2019, you kidding me?

Do you need more sources or we good?
---
I'll be interested in that myself actually.
---
In Vanilla I had a good deal of sympathy for the "I played a Paladin because I wanted to be a Holy Warrior of the Light and Defender of Justice, the class starts with a big fuckoff two hander and all the Warcraft 1-3 Paladins were badasses... Why the fuck am I relegated to wearing Cloth and pretending to be a Priest!? Why is Ret useless? Why is Prot useless!?" people.
---
I was lucky enough to be playing a Warrior, which meant every one of my specs were viable. But Paladins probably felt like they got bait and switched. Shaman were the same, where Enhance was great until you dinged 60 and were suddenly a healer. Druids the same but slightly less so, since Feral could tank.
---
Conversely, I had absolutely no sympathy for TBC Blood Elf Paladins who complained about Ret not being viable, because they knew what they were getting into when they rolled Paladins, everyone knew Ret was worthless.
---
But I'm not sure how I'll feel in Classic. I think most people should know what they're getting into with classes now, there's enough warnings out there that "If you have a heal, you're a healer" so it should be reasonable, we'll see.
---
Someone PM me when all this queue mess dies so I can sub finally. I'm not paying 15/mo (lmfao) to struggle to play with my buddies who are vming into their computers from remote locations to start queue times.
---
I guess that's true, and yeah communication is an important part
---
If you're friends queuing for 5 hours, they ain't playing either. Lmao
---
I mean...the fuck were you expecting? At least you know now.
---
They will for sure receive less exp for mob kills but it won't affect their exp gain from quests.
---
The lack of indenting makes my skin crawl.
---
It's Nixxiom's guild apparently, was already wondering why so many people were in it.
---
Hi, /u/Hairy_Pooltable

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwkr08/ran_into_garth_and_wayne_headbanging_on_a/). 
---
You off your meds?
---
Yeah lets sit in queue with my friends for 11 hours instead of playing the game. Great choice.
---
You didn't even linked the correct item lmao.
---
On top of that database aren't accurate in the slightest they are all using data that were used on private server for a long time and have shown to be wrong. I've seen a lot of straightup wrong info on those database especially regarding profession trainers.
---
I will get angry at people who actively break the rules and ruin the game? Yes? What else should I do.
---
Commenting to check back here tonight after work
---
Shadow frames
---
I was pissed. I had 7hrs of queue that night.
---
I didnt recognize Baine Bloodhoof when I saw him because of his size lol
---
The servers are selected in game
---
We don't need flying in Vanilla, but i would be fine with "Classic TBC" Servers. It's the only reason I'm supporting Classic in the first place. But also make new friends!
---
Is not using an ahk sympathizing with blizzard or other players trying to get in?
---
I play on a low-medium realm and there is no way they will be dead anytime soon. Blizzard has said it before, a medium realm has already more than a full realm did in 06. So great play with your friends, that's fine, but expect to be waiting rather than playing.
---
I’m doing that now with google Remote Desktop :)
---
If you listed something in stormwinds AH then it would only appear in stormwinds AH. You could not find that item in iron forge and no one listed anything in darnassus because no one went there.
---
Iron forge was the capital. Everyone used it because everything was close.
---
Then they linked the auction houses so that all the alliance ones linked together.
---
I have occasionally, but imo it shouldn't be hard to see which mob the tank is attacking
---
I disagree that all we need is to stop releasing new realms and spread out the pop so that all realms have an equal 3 hour queue.
---
This must be done.
---
I got night time on my server, and seen rain.
---
Sorry boss
---
BUT HIS ANECDOTES ARE PROOOOOOOOOOOF
---
Is that the shroud?
---
Warrior has been much easier due to player density making it so you pretty much have only solo pulls. I had a much tougher time this morning when it wasn’t so crowded and I actually had to kill multiple mobs.
---
Yeah of all this. Also layering is super fucking broken. I've been the only person in Ironforge every night even though I had to sit in a 5 hour queue to get in? They explicitly stated in the AMA that the lonely ironforge experience wouldn't happen.
---
Dude.   
---
Delete this now or it stops working for those who do this. 
---
Fuck your karma.
---
Pally - best support in pvp in the game   
---
Priest - decent support and much better offense/utility/cc
---
One of the best parts of playing human male melee
---
Honestly im waiting for september 6th before i even resub. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne comes out then. That MIGHT pull some people away.
---
aight thx for the heads up ! Here's an updated sheet my good man https://imgur.com/J1nsKv1
---
What about placing something on the W or forward arrow key? Since the key is being pressed to make the character move wouldn’t that still be allowed?
---
Yes and play on a pvp server
---
Ok, where's your screenshot?
---
Druid tanks are extremely extremely niche in Classic content. You won't do much tanking as a Druid either. If you want to tank, roll Warrior. As a veteran I've seen in Top 3 Guild progression raiding: Warrior &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Druid &gt;&gt;Paladin&gt;&gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter Kite Tanking &gt;&gt;&gt; Shaman
---
Modern raid frames. 1.12 talents and linked ah but with only 2 raids open.
---
It's definitely not 'no changes'.
---
Isn’t that what they’ve done with OSRS, though? And it’s more popular than regular RS.
---
Of all the dumbass excuses for broken layering, that is the cringiest I have seen yet.
---
Cool. And how many Times am I supposed to restart in your opinion.
---
We have 3 PvE realms at all. Not everyone is living in Blizzards all time favorite country USA Bro.
---
How do I access the cross-faction?
---
Nah, you just aren't worth arguing with when you're clearly throwing a temper tantrum and spewing a bunch of incoherent nonsense.
---
Lots more people in SW than I Thought.  Don’t forget IF is a way better city until cataclysm
---
Help
---
Doubt it, the majority shareholders wouldn't want a person like him and he wouldn't want to work for people like them. Dude is one of the GOATs and is enjoying retirement.
---
Troll is the best dps race for every caster and most specs in general. You can't go wrong with troll. I much prefer the undead aesthetic though. 
---
Class wise mage will outperform numbers wise but you will only be casting one spell the entire time and have a harder time leveling. Also you get a free warlock mount through class quest.
---
No, it’s dumb
---
Skarmtank on YouTube has a lot of great content on druid raid tanking. He made it look quite viable. There are only a few fights that druids can't main tank. They beat warrior threat till late bwl early aq.
---
They are invasive, you even agreed to that in the ToS.
---
Thanks. I could switch servers....yet again. I don't want to. I already made my way as an NE to SW on the current one and picked up so many flight points, I just don't feel like repeating that again.
---
"ur offended snowflake lul" the ultimate pussy Tim Allen boy cop out conversation killer.
---
so u dont like pvp
---
pick a normal realm one that isnt full/high ideally
---
or even a roleplay RP one but im not sure how the raiding scene is on these realms
---
There's both positive and frustration to me in the dev's statement.  I caught myself telling a friend last night how he was right in saying it was very boring getting started.  Even after Day 1, I was actually struggling to find enough mobs that were either alive or not tagged *more* than I did on Day 1.  First night, with a full server, I had no problems because the spawn rate was considerably higher.  Things were appearing almost instantaneously to keep up with the demand.  Day 2, there were not as many people it seemed, but I was constantly running around looking for a fucking boar that was alive.  Or Rockjaw Troggs....for fuck sake I found 1 every couple of minutes and then it was literally a *race* to get to it before the others.
---
Those long lines of people politely waiting for the boss quest were no where on Buccaneer's RP server for the last two days.  None whatsoever.  Instead, I witnessed less showmanship and more individualism.  I had approached one of the troll camps, clearing out the mob that was standing right on the item I was trying to pick up.
---
I was standing beside it as I killed the mob.  Just as I dropped it, a group of people came up, and one at a time walked literally in front of me to pick up the item.  And since it's Vanilla, the item disappears and reappears after about 5 seconds....then the next in their group steps in front of me, then the next.
---
At this time, I ask if I am in anyone's way or should I move sarcastically, but they didn't respond and just ran off.  By the time they finally got their crap done, the mob responded, *after* they left, and I had to fight the mob again all so I could loot this one damn piece.
---
I know these starter zones are chaos right now, but they are really putting a bitter taste in my mouth.  While I am enjoying the nostalgia of the game and the increased difficulty in some areas (finding where you need to go for everything outside a city), the number of fledglings darting around, tagging everything in sight makes it difficult.
---
I recall commenting in game how I had gone through 2 episodes of The Office before I could get 6 boar ribs because of the infrequency of boars found and the number of people tagging them from every which way.
---
All I'm saying is I am ready and anxious to get the hell out of the beginner zone and get everyone spread out.
---
Love the hype, but I think we need to see these numbers in 3 months. Reminds me of how excited people were at the launch of Draenor and how much the leveling experience had been improved.
---
thanks for tip !
---
Ummmm, this was something they did in vanilla actually. 
---
They offered free 1way transfers off of high pop realms into low pop realms.  I believe they also did it for unbalanced H/A realms to even out world pvp balance. 
---
So this is absolutely something they would do.
---
&gt; I just want to play and have fun...
---
Then play and have fun. 
---
It sounds like you weren't going to level with them anyways, especially if they already have a 5-level gap (which is huge when you consider the time difference).
---
Go on a medium pop server, play, and add them as Battle.net friends. You'll be able to joke with them in-game while still doing your own thing.
---
Nope. It's the people like you who are the problem. People that complain because they feel entitled to privelages because you deal with normal problems that everyone else in the world deals with. "Omg I work. Please can I have special treatment?"
---
Just finished first deadmines run where I lvld from fresh 17-18 and got cookies blue wand as a drop and my blue staff from VC quest. Had a fun night with classic. I’m ready for redridge
---
Is refusing group invites bad etiquette?
---
I only accept them and/or seek to group up when the quest objective is a elite/rare/unique spawn.
---
If the quest says "Kill 10 Mobs" and said mobs are all over the place, I'd rather solo the quest for more XP/loot.
---
More a QQ that just doesn't deserve its own thread. 
---
Warlock talents
---
Does the talent that boosts drain life also boost siphon life? Trying to plan out my build as much as possible
---
Sweet, thanks for the reply!
---
Yeaaaah I wont

Any addons? If this is happening without addons might be worth to report it so that blizz can look into it. There are bugs bound to be found sooner or later.

I doubt it. I for one wouldn't enjoy reading every single random quest text, which is why I don't.
---
You seem upset. Wanna talk about it?
---
Install TeamViewer on your pc and phone, start queueing on your phone while at work, come home with a much much lower queue time / logged in. Problem solved.
---
What I’ve heard is that the spawn rates are dynamic based on how fast the mob dies and how long it was alive
---
you can run circles around everyone and interrupt people capping the flag until help arrives.  paladins cant do that but they can heal team fights more effectivly.  completly different roles in bg
---
Shes a witch... Burn her
---
2 days, 17 hours....it changes a person....
---
Can I have some? What type of hat
---
Dont worry, if you start queueing now, you'll probably get in by the 13th
---
Once they hit max lvl u mean? you typed naxx

It’s fine to use it to allow GS2 to do your rotation though..

If you want to add Mantiflash, I’m playing an orc shaman there! Good luck

Yeah I mean I do love it, I main healer on ffxiv and just have lost interest in it after the pat he's to kil healers off :/ I know I can play a different class but just wondered if something new to play might be the way to go?
---
Jupo the troll tought me how to catch fish in ogremar. I never played wow before and I spend like 15 min just throwing my fishing rod out and beeing patient. apprently I had to rightclick the bait when I see it move.
---
what a life saver!
---
They eventually break off after they curl around your toe enough.
---
This. 
---
When they did it in vanilla you couldn't change anything except your name but only if it was taken.
---
Yesterday I saw a lot of level 15's, which means they played for 12 hours. I think if people are playing that hard they are already invested.
---
yas
---
Is it just #tooltip
---
I can't remember writing show tooltip.
---
Might be worth a shot
---
Oh man. This is Classic.
---
RP can happen while playing the game. It sounds like it's just not happening.
---
If I were you I’d reconsider your friendships. If they’re not willing to play on a different server to be able to group up with you and they rather keep playing without you, what kind of friends are those?
---
Find a medium or low pop realm. Plenty of players and I’m sure you’ll make friends there.
---
Damn, you're right xD
---
IT should be! BFA new patch shouldnt be a priority right now, It doesnt make sense at all. This is launch of classic you cant brush it off like that, it is the biggest impact having event they had in years. And also let us have dead servers, whats the difference ? There is option to merge then later?!
---
Just take solace in the fact that you aren’t alone. I’m right there with you brother.
---
Once they added the AH in 1.9 more people started hanging in SW.  so many fewer people made it easier on toasters back then
---
*our community*
---
ahh, for clicking and not for keybinds? then I'm not sure - I know healbot has this function, but I'm unsure as to when healbot got created - if it was vanilla or tbc

You're talking to a god. Show respect.
---
Ur welcome.

Level 21 Warrior. Cooking 85, Skinning 105 and First Aid 80.
---
Tonight I plan on joining my first Deadmines run =)
---
By the time you get to 60 you will get trashed in BG's. Just know what you're getting into. 
---
By the time you're 60 ilvl 80+ gear will probably exist. In that case you will stand no chance in your greens.
---
Just forewarning you mate, before you get to 60 in the hopes of doing BG but end up getting one shotted and can't even 1v1 anyone.
---
If they make it possible my group is moving instantly.
---
He truly did believe what he was saying. Because he's a corporate asshat who doesn't know any better. You ever hear him talk about wow with any real passion? It's the most generic shit ever, as is he - a generic old asshat. A generic old asshat who was wrong and deserves to be called out for it. Also no, the notion that they've merely decided to let it rest rather than address it is giving them far 2 much credit, and wrong besides. They - he himself - don't want to apologize. He's a corporate rich man, if you have any experience with that culture, you know he genuinely considers himself superior and in the right. Clinical narcissism is absolutely rampant in that culture.
---
im pretty sure rogues are the most OP class in vanilla.
---
There's no resilience, so you can literally 1shot clothies.
---
Yeah it was odd, healing wasn’t super complex or anything in rift but regardless I still enjoyed it even though I usually hate healing in mmos. Also the talent system was amazing.
---
Just making sure you tried the dwarf hunter trainer in Stormwind before you make the run back?
---
what addon is he using for his party frames? I hate how small the default party portraits because it's hard to see and so high up on the top left. I adjusted my UI scaling but everything else is alrdy big enough and don't wanna scale it higher.
---
&gt;Honest question, why do I feel like a lot of people poop on Paladins and they aren't popular Classic?
---
Definitely feels like perception bias there. Paladins are incredibly valued and incredibly powerful... so long as they're healing.
---
Holy Paladins are secretly the best healers in the game (ignore anyone who says they're not, Illumination is just that good) and if you slap on a Plate set and a Shield you're an absolute nightmare in PvP. Warrior/Paladin used to be considered the ultimate pairing.
---
They're only useless for DPS and Tanking.
---
It is easy for us to say, but making a "worse" game by our standards, that is played by by more people (because they cater to non-gamers), is potentially more profitable for Blizzard.
---
I hope Classic is the turning point where people put their money where their mouth is, and the industry gets a wake up call.
---
Can u link someone who refers diremaul as dm alone in 2004-2006? On my Server Zuluhed it was also called dm and dm w/s/e
---
I started with UO, then EQ, WOW... with a LOT in between.  It was never casual... and it wasn't much different from EQ at the time.
---
Just finished playing for the night and going to relax and smoke , i might watch this episode good idea.
---
I don't really care what Ion says, lol, but the second bit of that quote is far more important. Layering probably slightly reduces queue times by having a more efficient pipeline and dispersing the stress more, but just think logically please. It isn't being used to increase total server capacity. They're not living on their overtime. 
---
The servers are capped in such a way that they can eventually function on one layer. If they leverage layering to further reduce queue times , they create servers that can no longer be sustained on one layer. So then they have to reduce the cap back down and you have 20k queues 3 months from now when you're actually trying to raid.
---
They had two options, and I'm not sure they chose the right one, but either way they were going to have angry people. 
---
At this point if you're still on one of the mega servers you should either sit in your queue and shut up or stop contributing to the problem and reroll. They have to stick to their guns on this or the players will not disperse.
---
But that requires effort and time. Then theirs the cleanup
---
&gt; "Have you tried turning it off and then on again"
---
Sometimes I don't even get that far.
---
"Is it plugged in?" is a sad question that gets sad answers.
---
Naxx is a raid bud
---
As soon as you mark targets your groups will get better. This is the most important form of communication, forget about typing.
---
Also if you see a shaman casting earth shock or a warrior using battle shout, ask them not to. Certain abilities for certain classes build a tremendous amount of threat
---
Well... Tauren are, technically.
---
Lvl 11 or so. Think I have around 7 hours played. Almost through Mulgore.
---
To the people in mulgore chat letting everyone know Arra'chea was up and to the 4 people I grouped with to down him, thanks. 😊
---
Stick to your group, especially if you actually like dps. Mage will outperform numbers wise but you will only be casting one spell the entire time and have a harder time leveling. Also you get a free warlock mount through class quest
---
You don't get put back in the queue if you DC, there is a grace period.
---
i started like you in elwynn, went to dun morogh, did some end zone quests there and now i'm at loch modan doing some quests there. I follow some sort of a guide which will lead me to darkshore soon, some starting quests in ashenvale. After that im heading back to westfall :D that's my plan
---
&gt;with the best looking armor set in the game
---
But Paladins can't wear Warrior t2.5?
---
Plz do it you can, I'm at work myself, so take your time
---
Lmao yojamba is full fella it ain’t dying
---
I do get worried that most new players seem to roll PVE like PVP is the hardcore experience. PVP is the authentic experience and PVE is for people that REALLY cannot stand PvP in any shape. I couldn’t imagine getting to 60 with no WPVP. It’s like going to chipotle, ordering just rice in your burrito and wondering why you think it’s boring
---
Who?
---
I got a surprising amount of leather from dead wolves and bears and stuff that were killed by alliance players while in Elywnn. with LW, I just made myself a new set of armor.
---
I've already rerolled twice to move to lower population servers only to find them with a queue next time i log in.  I refuse to move again.  Free realm transfers need to be made available NOW for us to move off the high pop realms, not a month from now for low pop realms that are stranded.
---
Get to the chopper!
---
Knock Knock!
---
You can change the level range of quests that Questie will show you in the addon options.
---
The problem is, you can't anticipate when the number remaining will decrement. You'd think it would be like:
---
NumberInQueue * TimeBetweenPeopleLoggingOff = QueueTime
---
But how the hell do you get a value for TimeBetweenPeopleLoggingOff? It's not enforced, it's driven by human behaviour. Your best bet is to take the average time from the last few minutes, but that means that a huge disconnect spike will make the timer erroneously dive to 2-3 minutes. The other option is to widen the window to take advantage of the law of large numbers to get a better estimate, but when you have a player driven login spike at 4pm, you end up taking a quiet period into account that doesn't reflect reality and you get wildly huge or small estimates again. There are all kinds of methods, like using a Kalman filter to try judge what is going to happen, but it's all guess work and tuning by hand. I'm not surprised the estimates are awful.
---
Welcome back to classic WoW!  And congrats!  Good story.
---
Paladins get mana-refunded on crit, and free crit-heals on CD. So they can afford to be less worried about their mana.
---
I do like PVP but do not care that much. If I am getting ganked 24/7 while I am making a quest than I should go a pve server I guess. Otherwise I can pvp when when I want to. So what should I do?
---
I remember reaching max lvl them coming back for these ass 🤡s!
---
Bro similar thing happened to me! Someone in general chat was advertising sells Linen Bags for 5s each and I asked if they could make me bags later on if I sent the linen since I didn’t have the money. Said sure so we added each other. 
---
Before I could even get the linen the homie sent me 4 bags in the mail and said pay it forward!
---
You are scum let other people play.
---
You can always merge ones together. That's a lot easier than asking people to move to another one with 40+ people in tow.
---
There's no excuse for how they handled it. They could have added the servers from the start and this wouldn't have happened.
---
I'm an asshat because you showed up to this thread  to jerk off some internet rando by calling him god?? You're the fucking creep dude.
---
Except overwatch? Google where soldier came from... (spoiler: Metzen created soldier 76 art long before WoW)
---
Same thing happened to me once I rerolled on a different server. My husband was super jelly so I gave one to him.
---
If only Jeff Kaplan had a Twitter account. I could just see him going through STV and talking about the Green Hills of Stranglethorn that I believe he wrote
---
I know someone who did that. They tried logging in at 2pm yesterday. They finally got in around 10pm.
---
The feeling when I crafted my first leather chest, boots and gloves...that were white (common I think) last night...”Made by Blindeye”.  Ah the satisfaction of going from 18-22% mitigation was wonderful...with white gear. :)
---
Also, when I remembered to refill/upgrade my throwing knives BEFORE I needed to was pretty cool. I had to think, where do I put these things?  In my bag...oh that’s right I have a slot for them. 
---
I love this game.
---
I have read a lot on the web but most of the stuff I found was based on private servers gameplay (which is sometimes not a good representation of true classic). So that's why I was looking for some feedback on DW on the real classic.
---
We already switched when when they announced shazzrah was gonna be overpopulated. Im not gonna keep switching around because Blizzard is incompetent.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot.
---
Just be aware that talking about these addons here will have people chew your head off because you're not having fun in the way they want you to have fun.
---
I wish.  Work sucks :(
---
DM is def deadmines
---
This is awesome!
---
...............
---
i do now.
---
*sigh*
---
You don’t see this in retail. I’m so freaking happy that Blizzard gave us this. Once Que times goes down and we can be like cartman and say “We can finally play the game”. Hats off to you and to my future Deadmines group.

Hi, /u/sigsxox

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwkyvd/been_in_the_queue_for_4_hours_this_is_so/). 
---
Yes they will, depending. You won’t experience it for probably the first few weeks of playing (Depending on how quickly you level), but you eventually get to Contested zones where the opposing faction also has quests. 
---
You can choose to not attack each other, team up and wipe out the other faction, etc. you will get griefed every now and then, it happens.
---
Vanilla PvP is also really low skill floor so a lot of WPVP is just luck, numbers, or what classes are good against what classes . It’s just a fun mess
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
---
OFFCCCCCCC i refuse to switch, what am i mental patient? I spent whole day leveling my character, i dont want to do that again. And later on end up with same result as in this server
---
That is market volume not an index
---
The opposite
---
In general warlocks are a lot of work endgame.  Shard farming before every raid to pass out health stones, you have the pleasure of going to the raid to summon everyone else, have to use curse of elements to buff the mage DPS, usually have to run an imp in raids for health buff, etc. 
---
You play alliance?  It doesn’t help that half of horde is undead and can immune your fears for 8 seconds in pvp either.  Then there are tons of warriors who can immune it almost entirely if they want to.  Oh and tremor totem.
---
I still love them though.
---
TeamViewer is a nice way to do it 👍
---
Be security conscious. Opening TCP 3389 on your firewall might seem harmless, but if your security is lacking, it is fairly trivial for someone to exploit it.
---
But OSRS is a real diverging path that continues evolving like a real game. I doubt Blizzard is going to start evolving Classic. They'll only throw out Classic TBC and Classic Wotlk in 2 and 4 years.
---
Change your server and stop bitching.
---
im feeling attacked right now
---
Ironforge was still where everyone hung out after that.
---
Oh are healers just as respected in wow as in ffxiv? I think for just the subscription it's worth giving it a go, il have a look when I get back from work I guess
---
by simple logic the og servers have the players who already had active wow subscriptions so they could easily reserve a name on those servers. Active retail players are more likely to leave for retail compared to the people signing up just for classic.
---
Same. I definitely called it VC back in the day, and I'm gonna call it VC now.
---
Way too many keybinds. 
---
All you need is a left mouse button (or right, if that's your flavor), so you can click spells out of the spellbook.
---
Fucking over achiever. 
---
^^^/s
---
I’m happy for you that you’re happy to admit it without much bitterness. People change!
---
I’m enjoying the game and find it really interesting to feel myself letting go of the mentality I had developed as the game and I changed over the years. So far, I am quite happy to get back to taking my time and running everywhere and skinning every beast - and somehow not feeling like 2 hours with a single ding while below lvl 10 was a waste of time!
---
I'm about to hit 16.  I'll make sure to enjoy the peak.
---
Welp, now I can't waaaait to finally log on - still haven't been able to get in even once. 
---
Also - *Anomander* \- I salute that name. I salute *you*.
---
What's EU? Isn't US the entire world?
---
All
---
Smitten?
---
Yes, the BRD escort quest on alliance side is the least rage inducing quest to exist...
---
Maybe in phase 6 lol
---
I hope we get classic+ instead of tbc servers. They seem to be toying with the idea of tbc servers (and frankly I hope the people who love tbc will get it) if classic is successful, but I'd rather have more classic than noclip (flying)
---
A lot of people are invested, I am invested. But we don't know if there will be enough people to sustain the project. 
---
I think so, but it's still a bit early for us to be saying "I tOLd YoU sO, BlIZzz!"
---
I will watch it. Something to do while I queue...
---
Good to know! Thanks.
---
Got in queue at 10 AM on Mograine, 100 away now 5 hours later FeelsGoodMan
---
That's two fights out of, what 40+?  You will not be tanking for 90% of progression raiding, and people *may* be wary of even grouping for 5/10 man content with a bear tank, depending on a few things. So unless you want to heal for 90% of raiding content, and pay for talent resets to and out of tank spec and yeah justifying yourself to random pugs, then Warrior is the way to go. It sucks but them's breaks in vanilla.
---
"If anything happens to them, I will kill everybody in the zone and then myself."
---
Then they should have started out with more? 
---
It's either they had no pulse on the community or they're just dumb.
---
Everyone on my server (Burning Blade) called it VC from day 1.
---
Did other people on other servers call it DM? Yes.
---
One is not more right than the other. This just illustrates how different communities were between servers.
---
If I'm in Westfall/Duskwood/Redridge and I see someone say "LFG DM" or "LFG VC" I know what they are talking about.
---
If I see "LFG DM" in Trade all I need to do is shift click their name to know what they are referring to.
---
I honestly don't understand why this is such an issue. Call the instance either and people will quickly know what you are looking to run.
---
This whole right/wrong thing is just idiotic. Then to say it was "never" called VC and "always" spelled out is just straight wrong. Some servers called it VC and some called it DM.
---
If it was "never" done as you claim than we wouldn't even be having this argument would we? So clearly both names were used.
---
Goblins cities that have an auction house are cross faction.
---
Ashbringer is straight in but everyone just says how it’s a dead server
---
Only cause 420
---
Well test it but I'm guessing it's probably the same thing.
---
Maybe continue leveling and then transfer when those open up?
---
According to the Shaman Unbreakable, WF with the Raggi's hammer
---
I think Wod is better than BFA, BFA just has a lot more to do than WOD, its just a chore and bore to do.  Dailies, split islands that take an annoying amount of time to get around, garbage feeling specs, lack of balance... just makes all the content feel annoying in bfa but theres a lot of it.
---
on the flipside, I loved the zones in wod, the story for the most part and raids.  the loot in wod is some of the best ever, people still farm for it.  I dont see myself ever farming for BFA loot, but im anxious to farm legion loot STILL.
---
BFA is a dud.  this is coming from someone that has no interest in classic and still plays bfa
---
I will pick the cloak.
---
The last boss is named Van Cleef
---
Hehe nah sadly not :p I don't remember where I picked up o7 actually.. Probably minecraft or some equally dumb shit xD
---
Played Vanilla to Cata. Just resubbed. Going to play casual even though I know it isn’t casual friendly. I enjoy the server/community approach.
---
That's so hot.
---
Level 4. Still in Durotar.   Waited 5 hours on the queue yesterday and had to log off to go to bed an hour and a half later.  I had so much fun though!!!!
---
That was me all day yesterday don’t feel to bad lol
---
More servers from the get go when people reserved names. They added 10 or so on launch day AFTER the problem had already been started.
---
You'll face a lot of competition either way, but warrior you'll be building a tanking set AND a DPS set most likely.  I wouldn't worry too much about that part.  Every class will have gearing competition pretty much.
---
I posted this throwback to the official forums, but maybe you guys will appreciate it too:
---
#=========================================
---
#THE WALL OF NO - REVISED AS OF JUNE 18, 2015
---
SUMMARY:
---
1. Blizzard does not believe there are enough people interested in utilizing this idea long term to justify the costs necessary to bring it about.
---
2. Blizzard feels this idea is counter to the nature of MMO’s; non-progression equates to stagnation and eventual boredom.
---
3. Blizzard does not possess the old code. No, they did not save it as a "backup" - they might have for the launch of Cataclysm, but that was over four years and two expansions ago. Even if it were “recoverable” by other means (i.e., see “private” servers” below) it would still require lengthy and expensive rewrite, a task Blizzard denies interest in.
---
4. They have no plans or desire to recreate the original version(s). They refer to the notion as “a logistical nightmare,”… and in keeping with #1 above the time, money and resources required are prohibitive and unjustified.
---
TL;DR: “Too much cost, too little interest and it’s not what the game is about… we’re not doing it.”
---
Proponents of “Classic” (or any other variant thereof) servers rarely put thought into the idea. This would be similar to requests for the film industry to make silent films again, or the auto industry to mass-produce Model-T cars again. Avid collectors, people who look fondly back on those days, or new folks curious about the past might take a look at them, but that wouldn't be a high number of people in the first place - never mind the few of those who would actually pay for the experience. There’s not enough market for those, so those companies are not doing it; neither is Blizzard. That doesn't mean there isn't a market - just that it's nowhere near large enough to make it worthwhile.
---
BLIZZARD'S STANCE ON LEGACY SERVERS:
---
There are many Blizzard references on the issue over the years, from many different Blizzard employees; you can read most of them in previous Walls of No. For this one, we'll focus mostly on a recent (May 29, 2015) interview with Lore, just to keep the length of this Wall a little more bearable:
---
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ewtKpNMm4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m45s`
---
(Quotes edited for brevity)
---
I honestly - I think [progression servers] would be a really cool idea. It's just like - it's a hard sell, because it's a whole lot of work to put one of those together, and, the idea, like... if we put all of that work into that, that means ... those people are working on that instead of something else, and there's like, a GIANT list of what those 'something elses' could be.
---
We're talking about a time in the game's life when night elves were considered to be the best race for leveling because they had faster corpse runs.
---
I think the risk with something like that is a whole lot of people go 'yaaay yeah, no no no I totally wanna play Classic,' and then they play for like two days, and then they go 'Well. That's my fill of Classic FOREVER ... I remember now ... this game was not NEARLY as good back then.' *laughs*
---
Don't get me wrong... I think there's a lot of people that would actually be totally into it and be like 'this is the type of game that I wanna play.' I think there's a number of people that would be like that. I am just... my thought is that the sort of risk of it is - is that number of people high enough to justify the cost, or are we going to like - if Blizzard were to roll something out like that - would we be putting more engineers on making this work than players who participate? *chuckles*
---
The other side of it is, if we've got this one developer who's just doing nothing but this for... five years... like, what else could he have done in that time? Like, are we talking about, now there's two or three major game features that never get added because this guy was working on that instead? It's interesting, really, thinking about it, because it's the sort of issue that game developers face that there really isn't ever an answer to.
---
So like if you say 'oh I'll just hire someone else to do those other features', like, okay, but... then we're still faced with the question of should we have this guy working on vanilla servers? Or should we have him working on ... ANOTHER new feature? Like, hiring more people just means that now there's ten, or twenty, or forty features that never make it into the game. So. It's an interesting sort of tradeoff.
---
And there almost certainly is a point at which it would make sense. In theory, anyway. ... It's just a question of - do enough people in the current playerbase want this to justify the amount of time that's gonna be spent to putting it together?
---
The reality is, what would almost certainly end up happening - IF it were something that Blizzard were ever to decide, to come out with vanilla servers - would be something where they've said okay, NOW it's valuable to have vanilla servers, so we'll put ten techs on it or something, instead of having one guy sort of chipping away at it for years. Because then what happens if that guy leaves?
---
Blizzcon 2014 :
---
Do you plan to introduce classic realms?
---
No we do not plan to. It is too hard to maintain that many versions of the game.
---
THE PROBLEMS WITH PRIVATE SERVERS:
---
Furthermore: Some have argued that even if Blizzard didn't keep "backups" of old code they haven't needed or worked on for nearly five years, they could take their code from these private servers, if they so desired. There are three major problems with that.
---
1) Most private servers are buggy in a lot of ways, because they aren't perfect copies of the live servers back in Classic. Frequently functionality is flawed (broken quest chains – some items, achievements, mounts, etc., not obtainable); they are generally buggy and unreliable. Blizzard would have to fix such code to make it useable – an undertaking which would likely take as long and cost as much as simply rewriting it from scratch… both of which they’ve described as a “logistical nightmare” and have said they’re not going to do.
---
2) Most private servers are altered in a lot of ways. If the devs were to take someone's Classic server data and trust that it was up and running properly, they would risk the possibility of - just to give some examples - hidden obscene content, or hidden, functional, Martin Fury shirts. And, yes, that can happen: when Nintendo released the first Pokémon games, they were completely unaware of the existence of Mew until well after the fact. It should be obvious that Pokémon Red and Blue are far simpler games than World of Warcraft; it would only be easier to hide things like that in the sheer bulk of game code that Classic WoW would have. Again, the devs would need to spend a lot of time going over them to make sure they're up to par.
---
3) Not to mention that Blizzard's stance on private servers is that they are illegal and unwelcome. This has been their stance from the very beginning. All other concerns aside, for them to simply take code from these servers would mean openly condoning the theft and illegal abuse of their property. It shouldn't need stating here how unlikely it is for that to ever happen.
---
In fact, Blizzard had a recent banwave in April 2015, targeted at Twitch players who were streaming use of said servers:
---
`http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1751535-So-Blizzard-wants-to-shut-down-private-streams-on-Twitch`
---
I've read forum topic on Battle. net that Blizzard is shutting down private server streams from Twitch.
---
`http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/297116-people-getting-banned-on-twitch-for-streaming-vanilla-servers/`
---
People are currently getting banned within five minutes of turning on their stream. So yeah. :)
---
`https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/31cv9e/blizzard_suddenly_getting_aggressive_with_twitch/`
---
Every time blizz starts coming after these people, the community starts buzzing about Legacy servers, but they just flat out will not happen.
---
One of the simpler reasons is the "if you give a mouse a cookie" argument. You release classic wow servers, people are going to want BC servers. BC leads to LK, etc. etc.. Every time they release a new expansion, people will eventually want a server for the old one available. Of course, no one's going to want to go on to them after a while, but blizz won't be able to remove them, or people will !@#$%.
---
They cost money to run, they cost effort to maintain. You'll need at least one per expansion, and the thing is that they don't draw and hold crowds large enough to justify maintaining them. Also, they detract from the current game's market. Enough people spend their time in legacy, and when that content gets to stale for them they look back at the current model and think, eh, screw it, and quit until the nostalgia bug bites and they come back to mess around in MC/Kara/ICC for a month.
---
WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE CLASSIC:
---
In addition, very few players asking for a Classic Server have really thought through just what they’d be missing out on. Below is a list of key features introduced patch-by-patch up to the launch of Warlords of Draenor.
---
#SNIP
---
What followed was just a long list of QOL changes
---
After the starter zones everything feels pretty stable to me.
---
fuck spanish tho. unemployed, sweltering in 40 degrees of ungodly heat and a fake national pride based on absolutely nothing
---
I didn't have a remote desktop setup in advance so i'm seriously considering driving all the way home during my lunch break so that i can pop into Herod queue and only have to wait 4 more hours once i actually get home from work...

---
It's been ages since I used it, but I have it on right now. The only broken thing I've run across (that's obvious, anyway) is that my DoTs like Rend and such on my target aren't showing a countdown bar, just the debuff and the progress bar stays red and full until it falls off. Maybe that's how it's supposed to work OOtB, but my Battle Shout, etc. with durations on me work as expected.
---
Those people are idiots and shouldn't be in charge of economic decisions.  I doubt that even exists.
---
Thread is useless without the source tweet.
---
Thanks, I needed to hear this. :)
---
I might do that. I could always make another character if I want. I know the servers are brand spanking new but are any of them notable? What I mean is I know Asmongold and many other streamers are running on Faerlina so it's jam packed. But are the others known for anything yet other than queue times?
---
There is no community early on, everyone getting to know each other, it will take weeks or months to get to know players who play there. Are you outside of your mind my friend? Break economy, its first days what economy you talking about jesus.
---
I have bad news...
---
There is no way WoW got to 12 mil + subs ... ?
---
Guys, im going freaking crazy here! I can't for the life of me decide if I'm going to play Undead rogue or spriest. I'm probably mostly gonna solo level with a bit of pvp and the occasional  dungeon.  If i reach max lvl it's gonna be a few dungeons with some battlegrounds. Not really planning on raiding at least for a few months of being 60. Max of 20hrs playtime a week.
---
So what should i take and why??
---
&gt;Laughs at BfA
---
Ftfy
---
Yesterday I was near Dolanaar, by the furbolgs and I see these two hunters run by. I said "Hello, friends!" and they said "sup?" and I said "I was talking to the furbolgs." Then they invited me to a group, shared some quests with me, we ran all over the area doing all of our quests together, helped each other find objectives. We found an elite mob and managed to kill it and it gave us 9 copper wtf. At one point I ran out of ammo so the guy gave me 200 arrows. After we got back to town I mailed him a bag of arrows.
---
I'm a super high level now, level 8, and my friend who made a NElf wanted me to help him with some beginning quests. I didn't group with him so I wouldn't soak up all the xp and just let him tag stuff and then I'd kill it. Some other person was having trouble with the spider cave so we brought him along and then he ninja'd a chest but it had a piece of linen in it haha jokes on you buddy.
---
Yes, we do, but we need Blizzard to get it
---
I agree with you, but the outrage and QQ and forum bashing that comes from forcing name changes means blizz doesn't want to go that route.
---
Well that's like less than a hundred posters compared with the ten thousand per realm
---
I logged in 12 hours ago and there was a queue to 2 servers
---
The fucking raptor head quest is what tilts me the most, you need either 10 or 12 I forget but there is literally 90% of the horde faction running around in that zone also killing all the raptors how the hell am I supposed to get 12 drops.
---
“Huh, looks like that queue just killed you”
---
Thats the point im trying to make, thousands of players are trying to make this point.
---
It’s not, but there is an automated kick if a ton of people report you. It’s the way blizz gets rid of gold sellers but there are some downsides and abuses. 
---
In normal circumstances it’s very hard to get a large group of people to report someone all within a minute or each other, so this is not a problem. It squelches the gold sellers right quick though..
---
I disagree. Raids and Dungeons in BFA felt very one note. No interesting loot, all just "more stat bulk" with no memorably or outstanding things beside maybe the bleed sword from kings rest.
---
The game just lost it's touch... boss fights are also really just stuffed with mechanics and most mechanics do barely anything. Just complicated for no reason.
---
You're not wrong
---
As a rogue I cannot wait to have purpose and crowd control things again.  And ganking in hillsbrad foothills.  Can't forget ganking.
---
As someone who's played both RS3 and BFA, there's really no comparing the two. But one thing that should be understood about RS3 is that microtransactions can and should be ignored. They can give you skill levels, but at that point you're skipping the part where you actually play the game. It's pointless unless you're into the thrill of gambling.
---
People just totally leave the game cause they don't want to type their info. If you totally leave the game your DC forgiveness is gone and you go back in queue but if you just type your info right after the DC you should get right back into game.
---
I was legit afraid this would happen to me, but I was able to get lost in it just like 14 years ago. Games and tastes have changed so much in that time that I can't blame people for not feeling the same way about it.
---
It's like having a 2004 sports car that you absolutely loved when you bought it. In 2019 some people will still love that sports car for what it is, but many won't.

Glad to see people are talking full advantage of that precious playtime.

got it. so you really had a lot of fun with Rogue?
---
and speaking about armor, which one do you  suggest me to roll: Male or Female orc?
---
Some of the folks on this sub would have you believe there is no point where we can say that. It’s excuse after excuse with them.
---
&gt;since Feral could tank
---
Feral can DPS too, it just 13 years of pserver min/max to figure out how. And lots of dedication to farming MCPs.

BFA was not bad . I enjoyed very much .

I had fun leveling up , then dungeons and then raids . Overall , I am happy with bfa .

I am not comparing classic with bfa . I just saying BFA was not bad

Kind of an off shoot question but what are the best professions for gnome mage? Tailoring/engineering or should I pick up enchanting? Help!
---
Just got sent a bunch of potions for healing a guy that almost died :o
---
How much money did those ignorant news reporters waste prepping and filming that uninformed segment? the news sucks.
---
Also, one more thing. The consume you will probably spend the most time on is Demonic Runes, UNLESS you have a warlock or warrior friend to help you gather them. They drop off of Satyrs in Felwood and Azshara, its a pretty low chance, but with a friend I was able to farm 20/hr which will last you a good raid ID of raiding
---
yea, the skill cap will increase when you lvl up :-)
---
As I said in my post months down the line when everything is established, that’s when they will do the theoretical server merges. But we will it have to worry about that since they are being very caution about adding new servers. Enjoy the queue though.
---
Hi there! Resto Druid’s are very viable for end game context, guilds always need a few on a raid. Druid’s can also pretty much heal all the dungeons up to 60 without any points in Resto. Level as a cat Druid (which is extremely fast, second only to Hunter in level speed some would argue) and heal for dungeons. And max level you can respec to Resto for raids. Hope this helps. It’s what I’m doing!

---
See my response above. They were probably too lazy to type and exited the game and came back in from the client. If you leave the game the forgiveness will be gone.
---
Thanks for your response!
---
I always have to break it down into something like zone goals and just forget that I'm also leveling during this.
---
You don’t need to do this in classic my man. You make friends everywhere in this world
---
That's why they should allow free transfers while communities and economies are fresh and not set in stone.
---
YOU CAN JUST PRESS A BUTTON! - Brack
---
showtooltip doesn’t work in classic
---
So, you did change servers once.  Which makes all your previous statements blatant and pathetic lies.
---
You could change realms again.  You could accept that the rush of people is largely due to a significant number of people who aren't working or in school due to vacation to play and will not continue at this pace forever.  You could find a different time to log in to play, whether late at night or early morning.  You could find a different server to play on to pass the time.  You could talk to your guild, as I assume your circumstance is not isolated.
---
But let's all avoid the social interaction and ways to solve the issue and just blame Blizzard for trying to satisfy the biggest game launch in 2019 while simultaneously trying to ensure the new servers aren't ghost towns in 2 months.
---
improved frostbolt is the most useless for leveling. I usually don't even max that out until I'm 40-50's.
---
I just asked my friend again and turns out it doesn't work. According to chat, it keeps saying you go afk - you come back, but eventually it gets kicked out anyway.
---
I was missing Arcane Intellect!
---
Hahaah
---
That's just not true. If you personally DC, you get a grace period, but if the layer/realm crashes, you don't.
---
I wish I could find my "you think you do, but you don't" comment from years ago. I've never been so wrong. Classic WoW still isn't for me but I'm so happy for y'all.
---
You're waiting for around 120-150k people to call quits or reroll, double that if weekend is hectic. If there's a fresh realm opened on sunday and doesnt get full within 5 hours, roll there and cut your losses.
---
I played vanilla but madseason has brought me back up to speed as it was a long time ago and I have a few heavy nights since, so my memory isn't what it used to be.
---
o7  Madseason.
---
Lvl 13 mage. Started in a different server but rerolled due to queue times.  (I was level 11on the other server).  My first death was in the family crypts.  Just started Silverpine this morning and saw my old arch nemesis, the Son of Arugal.  I don’t know if I should go level with my husband in barrens or stick to Silverpine. /shrug
---
!remindme 4 hours
---
Zero bags at level 27.  I bought 3 and have a nice Old Blanchy 4 slotter.
---
Of course, I got 2 bags on the level 4 Druid I made during the stress test.
---
I guess a paladin might be best? They're mostly autoattack based. You could possibly try hunter too as the pets do a lot of the work and they are not very gear dependent?

1. 1.excellent."a bitching new album"
---
Ok, you're right, I am bitching.
---
I partied with a friend right when I logged on, but I was messing with addons and I dinged 2 just from my buddy killing shit around the starting zone before I had even moved a step. Game is clearly too easy.
---
This is the only RP-PvP sever on EST too. I’ve been playing on it and the community is great. Come join us !
---
Nope
---
Damn. Maybe your CPU can just handle it going mobo
---
That one definitely surprised me.  I ended up meleeing poor rabbits and stuff as i went by just for that sweet 3 copper when i was low level :P
---
So far is a fine PvE server. Less silly names (but not entirely absent). Trade and General is about what you’d expect.
---
People are excited to be playing so doubt we will see much RP for a few weeks I’d guess. I’m mostly interested in tavern style RP so very casual. 
---
People are being helpful too which is nice. Lots of saving other people from mobs, drive by buffing, etc. 
---
I’ve grouped and talked with more people in 2 days than the past 2 months of retail.
---
no ques and no lines on Kromcrush :)
---
Yes it's normal.
---
Welcome to classic!
---
I think weapon cap is based on your level, level*5 iirc, so at 60 you‘ll max at 300 skill.
---
Not sure what the spec skill points are for, though
---
LMAO! when you are so HARDCORE in wow that you cant even take a fucking joke that you fuckers are already bitching about.. fucking pathetic
---
Is that really what that means? I've been playing since '09 and that's always flown over my head!
---
You can just jump on the cannon at the top of the ramp
---
Level 16 Shaman, old lady is 16 Warrior. Ran RFC last night with a solid group, I'm at 50 herb and Alch.
---
What kind of server is everyone playing on population wise?
---
I was originally going to play on Stalagg because I wanted to make sure the server I went to never became empty.
---
However, I decided that I only have limited time to play classic because of my job so I rolled on Kromcrush. Very limited queues but the server pop is only medium, so I'm balancing my worry of a potential dead server and being able to actually play with the limited time I have.
---

It's kind of how it was back in the day really, most people in PvP will be running mana potions. Mages have Evocation and Mana Gems. That's why you see so casters weaving white damage in with spells.
---
Not really true.  People didnt have twitter and reddit back then, so companies made the games that they wanted to make, not what people asked for.
---
The industry has followed the trends of people.  Less people can no life games as the young gamer generation has grown up.  They ask for things to be easier and more accessible and its overlapped into garbage now.
---
This is why Dark Souls gets so much praise.  They just made the game they wanted and if you cant beat it oh well.  Its not even that hard, most NES games were harder.  Friggen ninja gaiden on NES is 1023203x harder than dark souls.  Its just a lot of people ask for things they want, but dont realize the affect.
---
sorry for ranting
---
No they knew people will play, they just dont want to open too many servers because they know people will quit and that the servers will die, Ion said this himself in an interview 2 days ago.
---
Your punishment shall be a ln embarrassing/played time of 17 days when you reach 60 lol.
---
but you can see him leveling 31&gt;37 in his past broadcast video?
---
It feels so stupid that they basically threw all that work on the Artifact system in the incinerator.
---
Well it's an American company, activision blizzard, assume that America comes first. Like a game i like playing is Dutch based they have more European servers. (Heroes and generals)
---
Well.. not too low tbh, given that these are pretty obvious names for wow characters, and everybody is in the starting zones right now
---
There's a horde quest south of Goldshire?
---
What addon is that?
---
alkaizer just dinged 38
---
Yup, can't beat the short walk between the AH and the bank. Just one massive meetup square.
---
Normies can play on RP servers. That's not a problem. Hell they can spam the general and trade chats too. That's not IC.
---
You can make tabs for different chat functions. My usual set up is as follows:
---
Default for say, yell, npc chatter and game notifications.
---
Whispers
---
Party/Raid
---
Guild
---
Trade/General/LocalDef
---
Really makes it hard to be spammed.
---
Yeah. It takes longer and longer to get weapon skill. That’s why it’s a good idea to train the main weapons your class will use. Cause if you get that BiS sword but no skill it’s gonna be painful
---
UO to EQ: This is so easy, there aren't any PKs.
---
EQ to WoW: This is so easy. You can't lose gear unless you purposefully delete it, you're invincible on your corpse runs, and an equally leveled mob has zero chance of killing me unless I'm AFK.
---
Crank up the settings as far as your PC will allow.  Im playing close to maxed out at 4k and honestly the game looks pretty damn nice.
---
Some of the models still arent the absolute best, but the scenery, cities, etc look really nice.
---
The last level usually takes a bit, honestly man don't bother until level 60.  Once you level and the skill cap goes to 60 level 55 and 56 will happen quickly.   There are easier ways to farm the 300 weapon skill at 60 than trying to get them caught up during leveling.
---
Need to use Teamspeak to keep it authentic
---
where mankirk wife??
---
What a horrible idea.
---
You do realise that more than a quarter is gonna abandon it in a week. , Right ?
---
Yes but it has vaulted ceilings so it’s ok.
---
Also think about how you will be able to see that player again because you're on the same server and may have to group together in the future for dungeons/raids, you never know.  One act of kindness echoes when you are kind of held accountable for how you treat others because of the server communities.
---
I just set up chrome remote desktop this morning, tested it out with the app on my phone, works solid.
---
Alright, so another few Hours to farm.. Great  
---
Thanks tho!
---
Go for it bud. The more stories I get to read about people helping each other and making friends in Classic WoW the better!
---
Honestly, every class is fun. Warlocks might have that goth magic that you're looking for, though. I'm having my girlfriend who's new to the game follow [this warlock guide](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warlock/leveling-1-60/) to learn stuff. 
---
You don't have to follow it to have fun, though. And none of it is really going to make sense to you right now, anyway. The most important thing to know is that you ***need*** a wand ASAP. Leveling will fucking suck without one.
---
Bfa (bad)
---
Pretty sure you can just hit enter (the key on the keyboard) if the character is highlighted.
---
This is a quality meme. Good eye for detail. 10/10
---
Probably just a fluke small sample bias. They should still be one of the lesser played classes. I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Even if literally everyone unsubs, they're surely made a profit out of classic already right?
---
transphobic /s
---
fuck that I rolled a night elf warrior for those sweet shadowmeld charges
---
Becuase thats a terrible solution with a ton of its own problems
---
Good thing remotely accessing your computer isn't against the ToS
---
Not only are you wrong, you’re stupid.
---
How can a streamer server have 55 in queue when the typical EU server has 20k?😱
---
I doubt they are going to abandon classic - but it's a question of maintaining two totally different WoWs at once, and also how they will do it will require a lot of player feedback I think, given that the entire reason people wanted classic to begin with was a rejection of many of the choices blizzard made with WoW over the years. 
---
The world is a different place than it was last time 1.12 was around - and it's not like any one thing they changed ruined wow, I liken it to an ice cream sundae where eventually, it was just too much chocolate and sprinkles and just - not the ice cream anymore. I personally won't mind quality of life patches (for example making healers a little more diverse like they did with BC by tweaking the talents to get some of the tools they got later - or giving people the option to dual spec because tbh it isn't fair that some classes never had to respec, others had to do it multiple times per week), balance updates, new raids/dungeons, zone events, etc. Stuff that won't start to erode at the experience of playing classic. 
---
Anyway, we got a few years out of classic before they added in TBC, and I would expect a similar timeline before any big changes happen.
---
///#showtooltip
---
/startattack
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
That should work for you.  I set up paladin seals the exact same way and can 100% verify it works.  The difference is maybe having the /startattack before the cast.
---
Are you using an addon that shows the sell price??
---
I sort of wish the camera pitched a bit while you were on it, though i suppose that would give some people motion sickness.
---
Not complaining, though.  I really do love how the gryphons feel to be on!
---
Even your sentence suggests it's not prices but rather volume. It kinda is expected to go down on big Blizzard release. I'd imagine we have seen same one during Diablo 3 release. 
---
Meaning people are playing retail less, which means less auctions are being posted. Nothing crashed, people are just doing something else currently.
---
I would also like to know this as well.
---
No idea why you were downvoted. I have made some attempt to rectify the injustice.
---
Looks like it was added in 2.3, so no it shouldn’t be in the game unfortunately.  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Deadman%27s_Hand
---
We say that a fair here in the UK too. We also do not agree with this.
---
Yes, because so many players end up crowding around the models that you can't interact with them or see them.
---
Sulfurus was made yesterday and I switched to it.  It's already full :/
---
Autohotkey should have a rand function. Press "w" for 1.551 seconds this round, then press "s" for 2.161 seconds next round. 
---
To really catch simple automation you would need to look at effective actions rather than intervals.
---
I wish lol, was legit sadly lol. Little surprised honestly.
---
As a priest, I can't buff everyone. As much as I would love to my mana only let's me do 4 buffs. I run past way too many people, there isnt enough mana for everyone.
---
damn!
---
I keep seeing two dudes everywhere, I was worried at first that it wouldn't live up to the last time I played, but the social makes it, absolutely.
---
There was a few guys doing exactly that last night in brill on my server too. Honestly love the community and willingness to help and the fact that everyone isn’t just ignoring everyone.
---
Love ya Chris
---
I mean, both are massively tiring. People saying either quote do it so often and in the wrong context.
---
That wasn't, generally, a change everybody hated so universally at the time though - I'm not saying there was nobody saying it, just that they weren't considered the downfall of WoW at the time.
---
It's almost the opposite right now. Right now realm pops are multiples of the actual cap because layering enables this, yet despite this, people are seeing ~7 hour queue times.
---
If the playtime on those servers doesn't significantly go down, queue times are going to be insane when they remove layering.
---
I would argue Orcs look pretty awesome in the later cloth sets. They are so bulky that the larger shoulders look pretty intimidating. There are some decent hoods too that turn the warlock into a bulked up grim reaper.
---
I’ve been doing a lot of running around, searching for the quest target areas.  Every time I run into a player, BOOM MotW on them.  And if they’re fighting, I’ll Mark, thorn, and toss a little rejuve on ‘em.  Been smiling a lot since I started yesterday.
---
Hopefully, we can get some real discussions in this post here. All I see in /r/classicwow and /r/wow are memes about the queues of the launch.   
---
I signed up last night and got into Thunderfury PVP (Medium) as an Alliance just fine. No lags or lines, even for the NPC.  
---
I decided to do Ret Pally. What professions are good for that class? Also, if anyone that is also new on Thunderfury wants to link up, message me! I have not played in years, coming back in my early 30's with the support of my GF of letting me game it before bed. Lol.
---
He’s on the queue for the queue man
---
lol ur fine
---
I don't think running in circles prevents you from being kicked.
---
Ohhhhh I didn't realize that! Okay that makes sense.
---
Kromcrush had hella queues last night and is full during peak hours. I’m sticking with it because it seems to be the lesser of most evils and I like the atmosphere so far. I think it will be a healthy server.
---
It didn't.  People will always offer up the "we had a tank druid!" or "we had a ret pally" or any of the other niche roles, but in practice that was incredibly rare.  And even if it wasn't, that was 1 slot out of 40.  
---
Maybe that can change now that people are more worldly about the game, but at the time you were lucky to get people who knew how to use all their abilities.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames for unit frames, SexyMap for minimap, Bartender for action bars, OneBag for backpack. That’s all I’ve got for now. Hoping to find something for cast bars and chat soon. Really liked Prat, hoping that makes it to Classic.
---
Absolutely fine. You will be doing this a lot throughout Vanilla. Moving all around the world and going to multiple zones that are around your level
---
Has blizz ever actually done a straight-up server merge?
---
PLAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO PLAY. DON’T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS.
---
I am seeing HUNDREDS of Night Elf priests, HUNDREDS of Human priests... I don’t think you need to stick to what the min maxing meta is.
---
Oh, you filthy alliance scum. 
---
Lmao, at least you are a mage!
---
Retail is loosing players this wasnt their plan :-)
---
That word is weird. I just say Q
---
I GOT A FUCKING CAPE!
---
People on privat servers are quite different as they are looking for exactly this experience. On WoW classic you now have a LOT of people who never bothered with private servers.
---
You start partway into hostile but it really only requires doing one quest in the south and a few more furbolg kills (depending on how many it took to get the quest drops) to get into unfriendly where you're not attacked at all. Really quick and simple to do.
---
The barrens are really good for leveling. Like reeally good. You're on a decent track.
---
Eh, at this point I'm too invested to stop caring now.
---
Honestly, I hope in a few years time blizzard releases a statement saying that more people play classic than retail and that it's been massive success. I want tbc!
---
mining/blacksmithing will help you after lvl40. for profit I would recommend enchanting/jewlcrafting with tailoring/mining respectively
---
Haven't been able to beat the queue yet the past two nights.  All my buddies have been able to get on and are a range from 12-20.  Frustrating to not be able to play, but expected.
---
Wish they would have had this many realms during the name reservation period, would have stretched out the population I believe.  Hoping to be able to play soon!
---
im the same position as you.  started at 12:00 from 11k,  now im at 6k, 4 hours later...
---
Basicly you often need to do several zones to get high enough for the next bracket of zones, so yeah.
---
You're damn right they'll quit by day 30 if this stupidity keeps on.  No one wants to play a game they can't actually play.
---
Out of curiousity, what chest piece is uncommon and at what tailoring level?  When I looked, I thought the first one was at 70 Tailoring, but online guides say 30.
---
Good to know
---
Yup, people in my guild said they come in without queue Iam at 9k
---
No there’s truth to it, just impossible o accurately say what. They defo would prefer retail with its habit making dailies and cash shop.
---
Paladins are amazing dungeon tanks. They just are poor raiding tanks. Not everyone raided in Vanilla. I was personally content with dungeons and pvp being my endgame content in Vanilla.
---
It won't go that way. What will happen is that vanilla (classic) will stay as it is. No expansion but MAYBE a new raid or two at some point.
---
What will happen is they will open WOW TBC and you will be able to make a copy of your Wow Classic account over to that.  
---
They will both exist and there will even be a third...
---
Do you have a Mohawk

I stopped after WotLK, this has brought all that joy back

Is this some sort of retail joke I'm too classic to understand?
---
Us Norwegians ended up spreading around after the massive queues on firemaw. Most are still at firemaw, but plenty at noggerfogger, ashbringer and flamelash.
---
Obviously we haven't seen it on live servers but there are clips of pserver feral cats doing 1k dps in BWL/AQ40.
---
This server is probably the most popular in the US and had 15k queues last night. I don’t expect to get on. The queue is not moving. It says less than a minute for the last 20. I am just sitting waiting to get on. Not complaining except for the going backwards in queue line..
---
I can see where people are frustrated, but at the same time this is brilliant and hilarious.
---
The same thing happens to Scarlet Crusade...They just face annihilation when massive number of people are chopping their fingers off for rings and overall murdering them for linen cloth.
---
Rip Scarlet Crusade.
---
My engineer had a roflcopter and my warrior a Netherwing Drake. I was satisfied.

It's funny because your comment makes sense, and is a pun on the spelling mistake OP made.

---
Maybe their philosophy to the game design shouldn't be based only on the grind?
---
Preach
---
Those are 8 slot bags too, damn.
---
Fear ward is not as good as people believe. It's a decoy to distract people from the real best class for priest, the humans.
---
Side note : night eleves just suck. But if you enjoy playing one, it's still a good enough reason to roll this class. Ignore people playing elistists because they are not good enough to deal with a fear.
---
Kenny was the hunter
---
/roll 99-100
---
There I beat the rng
---
You grouped for princess.. 
---
Fake news
---
soooouuuurrrcceeeee
---
So I have multiple groups of friends playing on multiple servers just like everyone else. I was able to get a good group of about 8 of us to roll on the same server. We picked Stalagg. It went up about 3 days before launch and looked to be a great realm that wasn't going to be too crowded.
---
Well, it has 5-6 hour queues that started the first night and started again at noon the second day.
---
I was able to log on in the morning and played all day yesterday. I'm level 21 and wanted to help my friends (making bags, wands, etc), but they can't log on until after work and 4 of them haven't been able to get through the queues.
---
I wanted to stick it out and wait for the honeymoon phase to die down but I understand that my friends just want to play and I want to play with them too.
---
We're leaning towards the advice that I'm seeing here over and over again which is to pick a new medium/low pop realm and roll there, but is that really the answer? Thunderfury went live yesterday and had queues that evening!
---
I'm fine with picking another realm, but it seems like the 2-3 realm Blizzard opens each day just get swarmed.
---
It's just a frustrating launch, I guess. Not a failure by any means, just frustrating.
---
What server you on? Think that was me in the quarry with you
---
Is it even worth it for me to sub and try to play tonight? I feel like I’ll be wasting days of a sub and not be able to play with all these queue complaints. My free time is very limited and I don’t have any to waste on waiting in queues. Maybe I should wait a week? Thanks.
---
wont you get dced anyway? pretty sure stuff like this was fixed long ago and all the server stuff seems to be the same as retail
---
I think 30 is the best rank for warrior. You can get very strong axe upgrades, your specs allow for more rage if you go arms and you can start dealing pretty good damage with beserker stance. You take more damage but you have good crowd control at that point.
---
No hehe, just popped in. Surprised there wasn’t a queue since it’s a pvp server
---
Do you think it's really that much less damage without bloodlust and axe spec?
---
From my experience it's about her destiny/dreams and how it's your job to make it happen :)
---
There is the best race/class combos and then there is execution of the strategy inaction. Some will be better than other at that.
---
I always quest in The Barrens at 15. Doesn’t matter where you started, I think.
---
What do you mean if you hold a modifier you get rank 1 for a quick dot? Is rank 1 faster than a higher rank one? I play a warrior, so...
---
Does it matter really since both require a paid sub?
---
I'm sure their subscription income has skyrocketed.
---
You can believe what you want, I'm just being real with what the general public believes. I know bear tanks are good, especially for 5 man content. Not everybody does. That said, I don't believe they have as many advantages over warriors as some advocates believe. They may have more armor (depending on gear) but don't have shields and iirc can't parry. That's not taking into consideration the lack of cc or self sustain or damage buffs that warriors provide to the party. They don't scale as well with gear if for no other reason they don't have gear options to scale WITH. They are meat shields. If that's all that you need or that matters, then they work just fine.
---
It's crazy! Every really loves this game.
---
would be awesome if true, i hope it is
---
They're good at healing in a raid context where efficiency is key. Having them be the main healer in a dungeon is not so good. Like their tanking they lack certain key abilities to give them the flexibility required.
---
Is that you, Tarantino?
---
Yup there is a solution, preeeeettyyy simple..
---
If you have a Razer Mouse you can easily do it.
---
App is Carrot on iOS.
---
Save your gold!
---
Yes it literally does. Blizzard can host million players servers with a thousand layers if they wanted to devote that much processing to it. That's what layering does. But blizzard won't because they are removing layering in phase 2 and having 1 million players on launch would make the phase 2 queues months long.
---
Ever heard of time zone?

Hate you for afking and hate you even more for thinking its ok to do so.. I still havent expereienced the classic cause i cant join the server i want... partially due to ppl like you i believe.. /spit
---
I was a warlock, no way am I getting the tag
---
You cant get afk kicked in dungeons...?
---
does bartender remove the griffons at the sides of the bars as well?
---
Doesn’t really work I was in queue at 12.5k I got in to play just under 5 hours of waiting.
---
Allen Brack announced classic. Thats pretty much the best apology you can give. But jk, you ppl still circlejerk about you think you do, but you dont.

That's what retail wow is like

So I'm currently heavily leaning into going Mage. I haven't played it for quite some time and as far as I remember it's a class that's great for raids, dungeons and solo play. 
---
On the other hand, I'm also slighty thinking of going Lock, which was my main class when I first started with vanilla. Then there's still the choice I got to make regarding faction and race. Tempted to go Alliance/Human as I've never played Alliance. But an Undead could be fun too.
---
Are the capitals ironforge and stormwinds? I haven’t seen any night elves yet so I’m assuming they’re in another area
---
According to this queue:
---
Even if 3/4 of the queue left for 3 separate realms, the queues for each would still be 3h 45m. It works for the odd person (like yourself) to swap and avoid queues, but if everyone does it it will just spread the queues out and they’ll all still be well over 2 hours
---
I'm a human rogue named "Defias" (nice) on Sulfuras if anyone ever wants someone to play with
---
Still. 
---
I'm guarantee they are way above their bottom line still with how many new subs came back for this.
---
lol mommy was putting the 9-monther to bed! But she did queue me up while I was still at work (despite not really liking my, er, addiction)... she's a solid lady!
---
They've said they have the ability to increase server capacity (add more players/layer, more layers, etc.), but they don't want to let 30K people play on Faerlina/Herod/Whitemane and continue phase 2 when they take away layering and suddenly everyone gets dumped in the same "layer". Would be unplayable
---
Agree to disagree, I love his accent.
---
4500 for me last night was like 30 minutes. Pretty short wait compared to most other realms.
---
I have. I have seen all the alternatives. There is nothing here. My friends are on the high pop server, tho i dont care, i could go on a new server, but that don't solve anything. It's all filled.
---
No. 
---
- Blizzard
---
Where did i cry about it? I stated that its unacceptable and gave a reason as to why. People are right to cry and complain about this :)
---
The number of people asking why the “summoning” stones outside each dungeon was bugged and not working is particularly hilarious to me.
---
(In vanilla, these were originally just “meeting” stones, you had to still haul yourself out there manually)
---
I think you would have to hit autorun again for the ghost to run
---
Eh, there's 1000's of people on the low pop servers looking for friends.
---
Did you manage to get Thex on your new realm?
---
Oscillating fan with a spoon is really just a low-tech bot
---
Hunter&gt;warlock&gt;druid in that order
---
Everyone sucks but me
---
On the selfish side of things, playing a class with a buff is like having access to every buff. Because if I toss motw on a priest you can 100% count on them reciprocating with fortitude.
---
People would lose their character names. Which to me isn't a big deal, but some people really care about it.
---
No I tried it yesterday, placed back
---
There is currently a 5 min window. If you don't like queues, you are welcome to play on low-pop servers (which they've stated repeatedly)
---
Orc warrior recently created here! Pm me (same name than on reddit)
---
Im at the point of quitting aswell the queues just suck all your life force.
---
As soon as I walked into Barrens last night, I messaged my buddy and told him I made it home.  He said he'd meet me in Crossroads.  He knew exactly what I meant and it shows how much time the two of us spent in that area back in 2004.
---
HA! This happened to me last night at bed time too! I was afraid I would get kicked for being AFK when my daughter wouldn't go the fuck to sleep (great book btw). And it seemed like bedtime took way longer last night than usual. But I'm a single mom, and no one can hit the space bar for me.
---
Great argument you got me there
---
This only happens after the entire US gets off from work.  East coast at 6 pm has little to no queue.  Once its 6 pm on the west coast then everyone is logging in
---
It’s probably due to layering. My orgrimmar was packed. We won’t be seeing that by phase 2 :)
---
Out of curiosity, how long are you queuing before the time you actually plan to sit down to play? And what server are you?
---
I'm trying to do the same thing tonight but I don't know when to start my queue.
---
I assume with group invites from other farmers else where in the world. They probably systematically switch around.
---
They can train staves and swords I believe, you can also use Wands but you shouldn’t have to train that. Wowhead is a great database if you check out their classic section
---
It is an entirely different game isn't it, the entire function of the game seems to serve to encourage co-operative play and player interaction.
---
I was one of these players. My group of friends decided to play on Faerlina originally, but when Blizzard announced that the realm was full and there would be massive waits my group and I decided to change realms.
---
We listened to Blizzard and moved to Skerem. Guess what happened at launch?
---
Skerem is full. There are massive wait times to get into that server. Enough of my group is already level 20+, and not willing to reroll. 
---
If they offered a one time server change to a lower population server, we would take it. Because we are confident blizzard will keep only as many realms as are needed to host all players who want to play the game. They said as much in the QA.
---
hardest part of barrens is finding Manrik's wife
---
Wait until people are hitting 60 and go there just to hang out.  Enjoy it while you can.
---
Hahaha brilliant
---
I'm not familiar with this, does someone have a link referencing this?
---
Actually laughed out loud.
---
Did you had my car in your garage(computer) since 5 years ago because i gifted it to you for free? then its a steal and i dont understand your point... ppl shared free stuff that now happens to cost money... it was free before so it was free to share also
---
I'm at 7k, I'm not getting in today. Crap.
---
Ie. Displaying vendor price of items when you mouse over lol. Those sort of things dont change anything. But something like making mining nodes not take multiple harvests or stop skinning from being able to fail could potentially have unforeseen consequences.
---
lucky bastard!  took me 9 hours
---
Hi, /u/Notix12

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwllos/ironforge/). 
---
Go in solo sit by entrance?
---
I’m feeling the love as well. Makes me be very giving as well. Some guy was BEgGING in chat for one cloth and offered me 1 silver and I was like bro. Just take 5 no big deal. This community is already so amazing.
---
Tuesday for US guys it is then.
---
Get party invite from another layer and if u have enought ppls doing it, u can actualy mine out all layers in one spot really quick
---
Well. I definitly understood this answer. Thank you random citizen to put so much effort in explaining your point to a stranger. Do you work for wikipedia by any chance?
---
In the end I took a quick picture because it was the message that mattered and not the image. Hell I could probably used a sad keanu meme for it.
---
For a subreddit about classic wow, they talk a lot about BFA.
---
Hunters are the strongest levelers and quite easy to solo most soloable stuff with.
---
Their raiding DPS rotation is tricky but you won't be using it while leveling or while soloing.
---
That being said what do you mean "soloing raid content"?  You can't solo raid content.
---
But its not a common thing to run into a multi boxer.
---
What level monster compared to you? A same level monster should be fine. +1 will likely take you down to half health. +2 will be a challenge. +3 will be touch and go. Also remember that armor does nothing to protect you from spell damage. Finally, learn first aid and cooking.
---
That's awesome! Had a similar experience on DD yesterday where my dagger broke while waiting to kill princess in elwynn. I regretfully informed the group I had to head back to town but another rogue insisted that princess must indeed die and traded me a new dagger to get the job done. Grobb had a lot of time to develop a community before launch. I hope DD can grow to rival it :)
---
Ew indeed
---
You are partially being naive for the making stuff for free part. They are mostly doing it to improve their profession quickly at 0 cost.
---
You seem rather negative. The game is obviously doing very well, we should all be glad. I sure am.
---
Exactly what I thought. So how are people going to sleep for 7 hours and coming right back with no queues?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKQnV-kpDhU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKQnV-kpDhU)
---
Discord overlay did this for me as well.
---
If the server just kicks you, you get back in. If the entire layer dies, you're still fucked.
---
If you downed any heroic raid in BFA in the first few weeks after release you are fully cappable to raid and kill anything in classic. So I'm not sure that your argument about brain hold water.
---
If the realms die down, they will merge them during maintenance.  
---
You'll go to be on Old Blanchy and wake up on "New Blanchy".  They've done it in the past.  They also turned on free transfers prior to the merge.
---
Copy the text I typed above starting with showtooltip, put a # in front of showtooltip, it didn't show correctly for some reason.  Hit escape, click macros and click new.  Paste what you copied into the text box and click ok, then drag the icon it creates from the macro menu to your action bar.  You can set a keybind for it within the keybind menu by hitting escape.
---
Well in that case I'd say they probs need to open more servers. That being said I'll stand by my staying that AFK scripts are strictly against the ToS and have a good chance of getting you banned making all the waiting useless anyways.
---
Is it a slap in the face though though? Should devs really be commended for their "players dont know what they want" attitude that Blizzard are especially guilty of?
---
No, if classic is successful now it shows that Retail is inherently flawed. 
---
The word I would use is a "reality check"
---
I don't think we'll ever see it unless Blizzard wants to pat themselves on the back either for how well they made a game 15 years ago or how well their current game can compete with a game they made 15 years ago.
---
BB is and always will be Booty Bay.
---
Yeah and that's why there is tons more slots now then back then. Also, there might have been more back then. There were a LOT of people. 
---
Blizz knows what they're doing with the queue times. They know it'll die down in a week or two, and don't want realms to die.
---
This guy gets it
---
Then come back the next day, log in, find that you got a 10k queue now. Been there already.
---
Just change all vowels to have accent marks in one version
---
Staves and One-Handed Swords, yes.
---
Wands, no.
---
Monday is a holiday in the US tho
---
Warstomp is so massive on Shaman.
---
Oh gotcha. Honestly can't remember what I last checked (probably that faction/race/class poll on this subreddit) but even the worst skewed ones were like 65/35 at most. I'd say you're probably fine.
---
Yeah she changed it to “beaten corpse”
---
I moved here too as Horde. Couldn't handle the queues any longer.
---
&gt; As stated, if they could simply bump up the realm caps by another 30k I think they'd have done that already.
---
I don't think you understand the point of the server balancing, population caps, etc.
---
They could bump up realm caps really high if they used layering, but doing so would result in servers with even worse queue problems. Queue problems that would persist for ages, as they decrease layers and thus the realm population caps get smaller, forcing more and more people to stay in the queue instead.
---
yes, yes it should
---
What's really interesting about everything you're saying is that several pieces can be interpreted in opposing directions. The costco selling out? Someone could make an argument that it makes them look bad, but then again the press spreads awareness which is good for business.
---
Blizzard servers being full? I can derive several conclusions from that: The game is exceeding their expectations, or they're being greedy, or they think its temporary, etc. but without extensive analysis and testing, its tough to see which of these conclusions are true. ESPECIALLY as a consumer.
---
Bottom line: I'm glad this product exists. I sincerely hope it proves to big business that there's a market for this sort of game (call it..... medium paced MMOs?), and I hope its around for a long time.
---
Is joke bröther but thanks for the advice
---
I'm off Friday too but I'm on toddler duty since our daycare is unavailable. Luckily she's a fan of the game and will undoubtedly want to get on and "play". When I got in right at launch and things were far too crazy to get anything done, I let her just tool around and she got to create her own character. An Undead Warlock named Innie lol.
---
Yes you can, I did it myself (logged in on work computer, left it running and when home, I was in the same queue on my home device).
---
Bag space has been an issue that stopped me from looting a few times.
---
I get that mentality, but howlong can you keep it up? It's only been a week, only been a month, etc? Many people predicted classic would be as popular or more popular than retail,  and how well would retail work if you forced everyone into 20 servers? At some point we have to just say that blizz underestimated the player base, some will fall off but no one really knows how many will stick, not me, not you, not blizzard
---
It's sad that happened to the Banjo series. But it's also sad that Nuts and Bolts is actually a fun game and would've been a hit if it wasn't a Banjo game; if it were a new IP of characters.
---
At least we get them in Smash.
---
Yeah, that's why I said "5 points in improved wand and spirit tap are a must, then pretty much what you want".
---
Personally, I'm already 5/5 Spirit Tap at level 14 and I'll put the rest in Discipline to prevent mana issues, maybe with Improved SW: Pain.
---
It will look something like [this](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=wlwPwQwRwSvjvkvlvmvnwpwAvqvwvxvovBvgvCvDvtvYv4vrvfvEvFvGvHvuDeDfDgDhDivpvyvzvvpvvQv0v1v2v3C8C9C_C.C~).
---
As a high lvl priest the best option would be the holy only spell holy nova. But literally noone skills that while lvling and its a mostly useless skill.
---
There’s unironically 18 months of content as we speak, what drought is going to come? Lol
---
Actually questing in classic wow is a lot less impactful/important compared to post classic.  Often you'd simply run out of quests to do and have to grind out a level.
---
I could never appreciate the dungeons in BfA because they added 300% trash for more time played metrics.
---
Exactly, it was awesome in TBC to be one of the first to be riding the Amani war bear from ZA. It was rare to have and it showed you were part of a skilled group of players able to get that mount. You ride around shattrath and just by having that mount meant lots of whispers to join their group for 10 man Kara or wherever.
---
Ask again in a month or two
---
I was making bags for mats in Brill yesterday for free. Nice way to level up tailoring while providing a public service. Tailoring at 75/75 and I'm lvl 10. Got some work to do coming up. Gotta get me some wool, although I need to level to get said wool lol
---
Imagine being THIS guy
---
Use wands, best dps possible
---
Yes a lot of people use TeamViewer or a roommate/wife to stay in-game. 
---
I don't even blame them it's all blizzards fault...
---
From logical and epistemological point of view, an opinion is definitely subjective as they indicate our own preferences rather than what can aposteriori verified as knowledge. Whether your opinion corresponds what is objectively true is an entirely different situation; one in which subjectively held opinion happens to correspond to what is true. So, yeah, thats just your opinion.
---
I'll take .85$ plz.
---
The extent of my convictions?  LoL... wtf?  Between that and your suggestion of a law suit make me think I'm talking with someone who ain't all there.  By all means... pay to watch a queue.  Fanboi away!
---
Do us have better servers? Or eu is overpopulated???
---
You don't play Windowed Borderless?
---
That's legitimately the question I'm asking.
---
Logged in around 8 CST and got through at 10. Started around 3800 in queue
---
A pure healer spec?  Probably overkill, my opinion would be you're keeping the party safer by killing things faster than doing a healing spec.  Maybe a hybrid spec of Elemental/Resto?  That way you get some damage and some healing to better transition from leveling to dungeon content.
---
Seriously lol
---
Blizz, look at blue posts
---
Trying to multitask 2 activities will make you quit one or the other. Just saying
---
Either go outside and ride your bike or play wow. Don't half-ass both
---
I'd say like 0.5% explore epic levels. Most campaigns don't even get to 20.
---
Horde version is cooking on the big fire outside of the Org bank.
---
Shoutout to my Smolderweb players, no queue since launch!
---
I have the same problem, i can chek for healing numbers but it wont stay on :(
---
Do you need bags! Cos I can make you bags!
---
considering the amount of small gameplay things there were that had a small gameplay impact (such as intelligence boosting weapon skill learning rate) and were there for rp flavour only, I was surprised it wasn't actually real. 
---
It would be an interesting mechanic to have, especially since it could have prepared dps to do slow dps on certain boss fights (i.e. onyxia) to not over agro. 
---
it might have just not been thought of or thought of but hard to implement.
---
It will be interesting to see how Blizz responses to the massive success of classic for sure.
---
Will they alter the direction of retail or any new games because of it? If subs drop off soon that will be a no, but what if they stay strong?
---
&gt;My roommate
---
&gt;"i love you"
---
I'm not going to go hunt it down while I'm at work, but they didn't say that they would do it, they said that their reasoning behind opening so few servers was that they *didn't* want to have to open up free realm transfers for low pop realms because of how disruptive that can be to the communities.  That implies that if we *do* end up with too low population on some servers that's their planned solution.
---
2k queue at 7 am, ridiculous
---
of thrall. ;)
---
I think I remembered last night, most of those sites that Housed the addons redirected you to other sites.  I went with the site that actually let me down load them from them.  I felt more secure that way, since the binaries couldn't be swapped without the site knowing.
---
Our group was split off of Skeram. Our no life friends stayed and the rest of us went to an overflow server. The dev's posted about server transfers so that's our game plan as of now. Hit 60 or 50 and transfer back to them.
---
Now even the overflow servers are full though sadly.
---
God, I haven't seen anyone use that term in years I don't think.
---
You fail upwards via the Peter principle
---
The "I demand compensation" and "can we sue Blizzard?" posts are my favorite throwback to actual vanilla so far. They really thought of everything.
---
I only buff people who buff me, or help me kill something.
---
That or possibly, the birthday of America. 1776.
---
That's not even true. I dc'd three different times yesterday and I was able to get back in immediately after alt-f4ing and relaunching.
---
Fuck yeah, dude. Warriors for the win! Overpower makes such a big difference when you're leveling.
---
FROSTSHOCK!
---
Do you need bags? Cos I can make you bags!
---
Do you have vertical sync enabled? Everytime I tried to enable it while switching to Borderless Windowed mode it would crash and give me that error, but disabling vsync allowed me to play.
---
You can get the next rank now, 50s at level 12 might hurt though.
---
By 1 day exemption? What do you mean?
---
I'd guess they didn't want resources diverted from improving retail.
---
Type /reload after changing settings. Most (if not all) of mine saved correctly after doing that
---
One of my buddies tested it on classic to see if we could do that. Idk if it's just while there's a big influx of people or if it's a permanent thing though but you definitely go afk auto running currently.
---
after you make a settings change or create a macro, etc, type /reload in the chat to reload the UI and save your changes. otherwise a disconnect (or anything that's not a graceful exit of the game) can wipe those settings.
---
But but the queue are so long, if I log out I'm logging out for the day. Nope, it is logical to just stay logged on and play all day, that is the only reasonable course of action.
---
15-20k on gehennas EU
---
i think thats what layering is but i could be wrong
---
Yeah it works
---
that's ok in my book. you automate the queuing, but don't stay online longer than necessary
---
Absolutely not. Queues are *WAY* slower than yesterday. So while the overall number might be lower, it takes double the time.
---
Yeah I checked but Razer Synapse is not against TOS (hell its even an official WoW App LOL), so good luck.
---
That's understandable. You may need to look around for some extra quests or to prioritize quests with lower level enemies. Although higher level monsters give more XP it's more efficient to kill same level or -1 level enemies if you are having to stop and rest. My philosophy was always to kill everything that gave XP.
---
And as the others say, look for other players (especially priests, druids, shaman and paladins) doing quests in the same area as you. You don't have to stay grouped. Run the quest and then say "Thanks for group" and drop out.
---
We were all warned multiple times about long queues. Welcome to the launch of a new MMO.
---
The funniest thing about all this is that Blizzard has already found solutions to all these problems many, many, many years ago.  And those solutions are why a lot of the people in this sub hate retail WoW today.  Cross-Realm sharding, grouping, and LFG was ALLLLL created to address population issues on servers.  They are trying really hard to avoid having to resort to those solutions again and just adding more and more servers are at odds with that goal.
---
The problem is that they just completely botched the implementation of a lot of really good on-paper ideas from complaints people had about Legion. Top it all off with how shitty IE and Warfronts are and it's kind of a disaster.
---
"made up of a mature community"
---
...are we playing the same game? Cause I can screenshot general chat on the RP server at any given second and disapprove that assumption.
---
I was just crying about that last night haha.  not sure if a lvl 5 would have found one tho.
---
No, your new found intelligence makes you perfect bashing.
---
Oh, you're playing Half-Life 2?
---
A common encounter I've delt with.
---
* Warrior pulls 2-3 mobs
---
* warrior severely overestimates themselves and tries to tough it out
---
* warrior is overwhelmed and tries to flee
---
* I happen to be running by and see this
---
* send in my blueberry
---
* dot the 3 mobs the warrior pulled
---
* have blueberry attempt to aggro all the mobs
---
* successfully down all 3 mobs
---
* warrior proceeds to barely heal / not eat and charges into next group
---
* /palm
---
No I do not have vsync enabled :(
---
I got my eye on you &gt;X(
---
I don't see why you would go restoration before you start dedicating your time to farming pre-raid gear @ level 60. Feel free to experiment with some points in Resto and see if you think they make a difference. Otherwise I would spec some into Enhancement to help with doing DPS but anything is possible really.
---
\&gt;Here’s a question, would you be happy if they allowed Hakkars blood  plague to spread for a couple days (as long as it lasted originally)  before patching it? 
---
Yes, I'd actually love for them to implement it as an actual event...it would fit the opening of ZG and hit that nostalgia. 
---
Of course that goes against the #nochanges narrative, which is what they've pursued so far. I don't think they'll do it, it would be funny if they'd "intentionally" leave the bug in and then release a patch getting it fixed...get that plausible deniability going on.
---
Because their metrics (which were incorrect) showed that 1 server would be enough. Now, they will release servers when and only when they are confident that they will fill up enough to justify releasing said server.   
---
They're a company who loves money - they're going to do everything they can in their power to retain the most amount of players. I'd trust that whatever they do has a very specific purpose that us armchair guessers are nowhere near getting correct via our speculation.
---
So you're just upset that people are expressing a negative opinion towards retail WoW, and that you just want people to stop negatively stating their feelings towards retail? Because if that's what you're going for then let me tell you. The front page of this sub reddit isn't filled with people shitting on retail WoW. If you're in the bottom of the barrel looking for shit to scrape, well that's just your problem then friend.
---
I recommend not leaving a zone until you've completed every quest in it.
---
I have been an on and Off player for a few years now, and I absolutely hate that design... I never know what to do, where to go, and every thing just seems meaningless, and always feel behind..
---
I dont care about the gear i get, its just annoying to have to go tramsmog it again, because everything looks like a mismatched Christmas tree..
---
I would love to go full live to win mode, but I am, unfortunately, a functioning adult.
---
Yes Classic WoW has some quirks like this but it's mostly in raiding that you'll see these biases.
---
Paladins are excellent Tanks, Healers, and DPS all through the leveling process and even for 5-mans at level 60. But it's a dead-end if you're looking to raid tank or raid DPS.
---
However leveling is a major part of WoW and it's going to take the average player 7-10 days /played to get to 60, which can translate into 3-6 months of real play time. So don't simply think about the end product, but the journey along the way.
---
Raid tanking in classic WoW is also an extremely demanding role. Since you have only two tanks most of the time, one main one off, and you're fed all the gear to progress, you basically have to have 100% attendance. There's no way a guild will let you Main Tank unless you can somehow prove you're going to have 100% attendance, and generally why guild leaders or officers are main tanks.
---
Is there an idea of what you are wanting to do in classic? Maybe there is something you'd enjoy outside of the tanking role.
---
Nice. I've been embracing the vendoring machine aspect of my mage to the max, traded so much food and water to random players
---
Blizz opened new realms. Use them!
---
Yeah what even happens if you run off the continent while dead
---
We got Mankirk, now its time for Mankirk's wife
---
/r/HailCorporate
---
Screenshotting isnt hard
---
People are at work. I know for much of the fanbase it's a hard concept to grasp. But as a bigglesworth player, Its been asked at least 4-5 times a minute in general chat. That classic is supposedly dead a day after launch. Like just play the game
---
I left it there to showcase why ! Haha
---
All the NA servers at least are full at night.
---
Like 15-17k+ of those have no hope of ever playing on that server during prime-time if they don't vanish from that server.
---
Keywords: your post made you sound like a whiney entitled brat.
---
Hurts
---
Ahh I just finished my third read-through of Lord of Chaos yesterday! The last chapter will leave your blood chilled and have you aching for more. Enjoy!
---
Honestly, the jokes on me because the queue was so long I wound up falling asleep before I got on. Can't get frustrated with lines if you never even get to play!
---
Blizz pls create more servers
---
Yup I leveled a warrior back in the day that's how it always felt. Yes it does get much better when you get geared but until then you will feel weak.
---
However get some gear and a healer with you and you'll have the best time ever
---
It's just for the queues till I get home, so doesn't require much in the way of bandwidth.
---
Because WoW Classic is life.
---
Fortnight is just the rebound.
---
no more true classuck experience on herod the heroes realm??
---
True, I guess I'm thinking of these early game guns, which have a quick attack speed.
---
Farm wailing caverns it’s super fast leveling, you will have a easy  finding a group. Warrior leveling solo is tough for awhile. I’ll get some hate for saying this but try to make sure the healer is a priest. There PWS is bonkers at this level and makes it smoother
---
This is not the purpose of classic wow. We arent enemies. I dont want my guild to die and it's scummy that you find joy in this.
---
What does this fucking even mean though? Literally nothing but people will keep repeating it
---
Diseases usually are incurred when you are fighting a mob. Priest and Paladins and Shammys can cleanse these. Poisons(Spiders/Rogues) can be cleansed by Shamans (I believe paladin) and Druids. Magic effects such as the slow effect from getting hit by a frostbolt is cleansed by Priests. Curses effects are casted by warlocks, though only 1 curse can be on a target unless multiple warlocks cast multiple different curses... Curse effects are cured by Mages and I believe Druids? Don’t quote me on curses as far as Druid’s lol but I’m 75% sure mages can cast *Remove Curse*

I was the douche who ganked Garrick Padfoot from like a pile of 20 people.........I’m sorry....
---
EU had a shutdown yesterday I believe which was around 15 minutes
---
You said, "It doesn't matter which server, you are going to get stuck in a queue at the popular times in the evening unless you pick a pvp server".
---
Randy bo bandy!
---
For this beautiful moment on reddit.
---
Maybe they do though? I don't think it's that well known how sitting around for a full day can be deadly. Raising awareness is never a bad idea.
---
I've been reporting these people when I see them tbh...
---
Never played warrior in classic myself but from what I remember, if you are tanking more than 2/3, then your group is doing it wrong. Aoe clearing dungeons was not a thing in classic, you need CC.
---
I don't want them to do the old expansions.  Make brand new content on the bones of wow just as it is now, preferably within the existing zones so the player base doesn't get spread so thin as it used to.
---
I farmed gold when I was bored the last month while waiting for my new contract, so I went online yesterday and liquidated all crafting materials, cosmetic items and pets I could. 
---
Made enough for two additional tokens and had enough money for two already. The only thing I kept is a meagre 5k gold and my gear in case I ever feel like RPing there again.
---
Otherwise, all my 800k went into buying subscription tokens.
---
Try Benediction, it's the newest PvP server in that timezone.
---
They won't do this.  I truly believe they don't want WoW classic to succeed.
---
It does hurt seeing all the people who have either had off the entire week or don’t have jobs. They just wow and sleep. Oh how I miss those days
---
Thank you very much for the info. I didn't realize that enemy cast bars weren't a thing in classic.
---
Maybe I will just tough out ElvUI until fixes roll out then. I really don't want to deal with another UI setup right now.
---
An interesting theory.  I can't really find anything disprovable about it.  That would explain a lot.
---
I actually rather.
---
Nope,  it's not dead we raided mythic last night.
---
NA
---
Says that the community doesn’t use flair for me.
---
I think many people discovered Wow pretty late and never really had the chance to be part of it when it launched. 
---
I played since WOD but never really super serious. But I go all out in classic because I finally have a chance to stay with the pack.
---
I know exactly how hard it is to get banned for something like this, and I'm not assuming you will be neither. Oh, I'm not watching streamers so no thanks.
---
I just hope they ban you, cause you're being a dickhead to the rest of the community. Pretty sure everyone here would gladly move on without you with us, wasting valuable server slots.
---
Shits fucked.
---
pros  
---
\- u'll want mats eventually to enchant your stuff  
---
\- cost of the dust/shards can be more expensive than the item itself  
---
\- turn all those random greens into stackable dust/shards/etc for storage consolidation  
---
\- level 5 character with disenchant can disenchant all gear all the way up to 60
---
cons  
---
\-wont be able to disenchant bind on pickup on your main for most shards
---
Blizzard said that medium servers now are more populated than high servers back then. Unfortunately we have no numbers to go by so you're sadly wasting your time.
---
All the best
---
It caught me off guard how nice people were being. I had a few people politely whisper me asking for water and then tip. Also, everyone just buffs everyone who walks by.
---
I had the opposite issue, fullscreening it from windowed did the same thing; so I set the windowed resolution to my native one and it worked. Maybe try setting it to a lower res from the dropdown and then setting it windowed?
---
In WowI love how the answer to every quest or problem is the mass extinction of a species or culture. Kinda mimics reality.
---
so true man!
---
I meant it as a shorthand for bis warrior
---
I'm happy to hear that.
---
I fully agree with this. In classic you have to earn everything. When you level up you have to physically travel to a trainer and pay precious money to learn new abilities! It makes it so much more satisfying.
---
I was at 5 hours before me and my buddy decided to just roll random toons on a new realm because its better than sitting in queue forever, even if we don't use those toons after the queues stop happening
---
Still puts you afk
---
Bruh have you never played a wow expansion before? This happens for the first weekend literally everytime
---
It took a while to get used to, but now I always unbind asd and only move with qwe and right click. It's a lot easier to maneuver in my opinion.
---
I had the same issue. Updating my Radeon video drivers fixed it, might want to try that!
---
They had warnings that even medium pop servers will have queues. We all knew this was coming. This is how MMO launches go. Just wait a week.
---
Wholesome!  Love it.  Lets all do our part and make Pagle's community thrive and prosper
---
I see what you mean. There’s no returning to the days before twitch and YouTube.  There is a part of me however that thinks the copycat MMO’s that came after wow cut corners and created shortcuts for what they viewed as WoWs shortcomings that ultimately cheapened the  player experience. Of course World of Warcraft had a mountain of lore to build off of which is difficult to reproduce. But I don’t think the incentives in the brain That hooked so many players back then have changed. The one thing that World of Warcraft did so well was not break immersion, this concept seems lost today. 
---
I’ve heard great things about Final Fantasy, but I’m not sure I can get into an Asian look and feel. What about the role playing does final fantasy get so right?
---
I too would like to know this!
---
I would say the Tauren are the biggest organisation and the other races more or less banded together to whipe them out because individually they wouldn't stand a chance and feel threatened by the Taurens power.
---
Mulgore is the most fertile land and I'm sure a major producer of food. Also the tauren are technically and socially more developed then their competition giving other advantages. 
---
Add to this centuries of warfare and grudges and not compatible policies (quillboars are quite necromancer friendly vs. druidic tauren).
---
The centaurs I think are nomadic and specialize in living in low fertile lands. It's quite likely that a few plains the Taurens took for their farms where former centaur territory.
---
All in all just economic/political speculation.
---
gioves a month of sub
---
I'd do Tailoring/Enchanting or Herbalism/Alchemy. Big bank in double gathering tho. (like mining/skinning)
---
You do not seem to understand servers. Your theoretical benefit from splitting horde and alliance onto separate servers is predicated on the assumption that each world is only one or two servers. There is a "server" PER layer, PER continent. The "realm" is made of of MANY virtual servers, dynamically added and removed while its running. Its not one server that would see half the traffic by splitting it in two.
---
Both remote queuing and autorun afking aren't the root cause, they're a symptom thats probably making it worse.
---
I honestly can't tell if this is sarcasm or not.
---
Most of ElvUI works fine.
---
We have a statue of Thrall in our world. They should build a Metzen statue in Azeroth. Preferably at the entrance of Org. They could make it so his arms outstretched and he can hold Ony/Nef head after turn in.
---
Yep, if that's what they're doing.
---
Auto run techincally isn't a constant input or keystroke tho.
---
isn't it "The Boyz"?   The Amazon show right?  I binged that this weekend, yes watch, very good.
---
yup blizzard back gold trading. sub time for gold
---
Pls no flying
---
What server were you on? I'd be willing to bet it wasn't one of the top populated ones.
---
Make sure you are in defensive stance 1st.
---
Thunderclap as it's off CD
---
There is no limit to how many mobs you can sunder so get 1 or 2 on a target, tab to/click the next put one or two. Rinse and repeat. The main target should always have 5. It will also help to mark the main target.
---
When it comes to marking you can either mark pre-pull using several markers. Or just mark one as the main target, then mark the 2nd when the first is dead. Personally I like marking all the targets in advanced as it's easier to mark priority targets before they are all clumped together.

---
I was leveling blacksmithing in goldshire. Starting mail armor for everyone!
---
Cause I’m a warrior tank lvling as prot and those greedy bastards ninja my gear, lol
---
I’m actually shocked new players enjoy it so much. I was thoroughly convinced it’s nostalgia at this point. Super happy that wasn’t the case
---
Or that with less content, content actually matters more.
---
[Screenshot from Wesbtw's stream](https://i.imgur.com/PpzGn6i.png) 4:45AM BST (about 11 hours ago). You can see the GRIZZLY roster (same guild Ahmpy is in) and their highest levels online.
---
as a caster your melee skill will suck  since you don't have STR or Agility.  But your wand will improve.
---
So at lvl 10  your weapon might be about on par with the wand, but at lvl 30 it won't and at lvl 50 it will be a joke.
---
The start zones are extremely pack. Made a new character on a pve relm last night 1-5 took maybe nore time than 6-10 lol
---
Don't apologize to me, apologize to every person you come into contact with doesn't appreciate other people out-sizing their impact outside the game for entirely self-serving purposes
---
How did you set up remote access?
---
I completely agree with you. No excuse for any ques besides ignorance or not wanting to put more resources into it. There band aid is to just toss more servers at it.
---
I'm a LW too. I got to 75 skinning before I hit level 5 because of all the beast corpses around. Seeing my crafted gear actually being useful not only to myself, but other players, is amazing. Instead of vendoring the stuff I make, I sit in Org selling the stuff for whatever people want to pay. It's usually 3s. I don't care. Anything that doesn't get used gets sent off to a buddy to get DE'd.
---
They've reacted poorly when all the servers during name reservations were FULL.  They should have created new servers more frequently.  They had to have known they'd get just as many, if not more, new players at launch.  Players that didn't reserve a name.
---
Sucks for him.
---
I personally went skinning and tailoring as the income early on from skinning is sooo nice. Just my 2 cents
---
Is Goofy referring to posting this meme to this sub every 30 minutes?
---
Gotta swim down the coast and straight into Westfall to avoid all of that. This is from someone who did that 15 years ago for a Defias mask. 👍
---
Do you guys not have more realms?
---
Rolling restarts are from 8-9am as in the entire hour, right?
---
I'm having a crazy good time just saving people from mobs and socializing. Before I would've never even interacted with anyone. This is so fun man.
---
Vine was an app that is now defunct in which users submitted and viewed videos which were typically less than ten seconds long. Their content was often comedic in nature. My initial reply was one such vine, in which a gentleman parodied someone complaining about the female Ghostbusters drama, and ended with a small jingle, the lyrics to which were "I'm an adult virgin!" My reply was parodying a parody, if you will, as your initial reply was strikingly similar to the complaints made by the gentleman in the original vine.
---
Every day's a school day!
---
Haha same dude. Full time job and Physics PhD program doesn’t let much time for wow. 
---
Today was the first chance i had to log in and the servers went down for maintenance within 10 mins.
---
A book series by the late Robert Jordan that has forever changed my life and my view of the world. 
---
Definitely worth a read or a listen if you're into science fiction/fantasy with long winded world/character building
---
Well looks like they had back up servers to throw in just in case and now all those are full with very long ques too. 
---
I am itching to see data lol
---
It says an hour but guys were saying it should last 15 min? Not really sure
---
1. Run into the north cave where you get the mining pick in Valley of Trials, and die in most northern part of cave. Resurrect at Razor Hill and run west into Barrens. Once in Barrens, kill yourself and resurrect at Cross roads. Once at cross roads, run south until you cross the bridge and see "Southern Barrens" pop up on your screen. Kill yourself, and resurrect at Camp T. Run west into Mulgore and as soon as you enter, kill yourself, and you will resurrect in Bloodhoof village.
---
2. It's personal preference, so maybe think about how you'll be nick-named. I loved my character name Rathez until people started calling me Rat for short lol. Do you want to be called Blood or Hus/Husa in discord?
---
People are at fucking work man. Calm down, knee jerk much
---
But if you remote in and move once every 30mins you’re good? Seems like they should lower that time by a lot.
---
Dun dun ah ahhhh
---
Live in the moment and enjoy things.
---
For what?
---
Smack that button as if it delivers morphine
---
very evenly split, go alliance
---
Tell that to all of my friends irl who are already like level 20 lol 
---
Oh well. I'm gonna enjoy my time regardless it seems :)
---
probably gonna get downvoted because this is the classic wow subreddit, but retail, while not good at all currently, still isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be
---
God now I'm excited for you. Hope you enjoy it, it's definitely a game I wish I could experience for the first time again although classic has really bought a lot of that feeling back already.
---
I've been waiting in queue for over an hour now... My friend who was still playing disconnected at the time I was waiting and was able to instantly reconnect.
---
Fuck these servers
---
Maybe it's because you did alt f4 and that counts as a crash. I exited cause I was lazy and that is the only time I got out back in queue.
---
Yeah this is dumb butttttt.... the fact that this is such a one off case says a lot about how great this community is overall.
---
Wouldn’t it be better to just dick around on a lower pop server for 2 weeks than just sit in queue everyday? That’s what I’m doing. I will eventually switch to a different server but for now, I’d rather play than not play. Not much difference between wasting time in queue and wasting time leveling on a different realm. At least I’ve played the last 2 nights.
---
that's normal, everything is a hunter weapon after all
---
You are the story in Classic friend. How will you evolve? What will you be known for? I have no idea... yet!
---
to be completely honest I don't think "thot" was a widely used slang word back when thottbot was created
---
Yeah bro just pick a low pop server that will be dead withing a month haha LMAO whats the problem bro?
---
buffs... give me buffs!!! a heal be nice as you run past,
---
Just get a life :)
---
It has nothing to do with the genre of the game. Arthas in the story cinematics was a GIANT in comparison to his fellow soldiers.
---
It sounds like you shouldn't play classic WoW if you're that annoyed by lack of facial hair for 2 races.
---
on the other hand the people that couldnt make time to nolife it now u can bet they will go all in on the weekends
---
Shift 1,2,3....
---
Ctrl 1,2,3...
---
Mouse buttons
---
Cheap mmo mouses on Amazon with 18 mouse buttons combine those with modifiers you can get like 36 spells from mouse alone
---
okay so it was something that happened 1 time? doesn't really seem like something to be bothered about.
---
I saw a Zero to Hero theme with WoW. 
---
You started off not expecting to live past the first order given. When you do they just keep giving more orders.  You didn’t know jack squat so you had people train you. After being taught everything (over the 100 levels) you began to develop your own techniques (it was more of the artfact weapon but still).  To me Legion was the high point of playing because you reached the highest rank of your class.  It’s like a military private working their way up to 3 star general over a 40-60 year career.
---
Click the mousewheel to the side. It'll auto run..
---
A Human Mage had saved me from a big aggro in Teldrassil...and then immediately turned and killed a defenseless deer. I said, "DUDE! NOT COOL!" then we shared a laugh, great times on that tree, make Darnassus great aga... Well just make it great I guess. XD
---
If you have to create a macro to interact with an NPC, then it isn't working.
---
Its different to retail. You're likely to be wanding a fair bit and casting one biggish heal to top someone up, rather than consistent throughput.
---
Right, but in this specific case, considering most of us have already been there, done that, with some of us being living encyclopedias on the game, I really don't get those who view questing add-ons negatively.
---
Vanilla had no real LFG to speak of other than yelling in general chat.
---
BC Raiding was much much more strict on builds and classes. Basically the "required" specs and gear levels were enforced far more. Vanilla there was much more flexibility you could have with these things and still get the job done. Resistances were extremely important and over time became more and more pointless.
---
People did the same thing you did Monday night. They joined the servers that were released that very same night. They were low population and had no queues. Then they were greeted to a 10K+ queue on the same server last night. Would you want to redo 5-10 hours of work and start over on another low pop server when the same thing will likely happen again the next night? What if your friends also rolled on that same server and they played all day and got to level 20+. Are you going to ask them to swap too? No, you won't. You'll just wait.
---
What’s layering?
---
Dang you got to the wetlands already?!
---
&gt;Be mad at blizzard for putting people in a situation where they feel risking their account is the only way to be able to play.
---
Yeah, it's blizzard's fault I'm cheating! Seriously?
---
What exactly do you expect blizzard to do to avoid this? Open 100 servers, so they're all dead after 3 months?
---
Stance dance macro is pretty much essential
---
/cast [stance:1]Berserker Stance;[stance:3]Defensive Stance;[stance:2]Battle stance
---
You can add in cast blood fury to deal with fears
---
I'm glad you think so and I'm glad you enjoy it.
---
Well yeah I guess that would work too, but for me there's 2 problems with that;
---
friends are playing in the evening, not in the morning
---
I'd have to have some SERIOUS lack of sleep to ever be able to sleep before 11pm
---
Yes, there could probably be more PVP servers considering every single one has a queue 2-5x the size of the server itself. However, also consider how many people will quit the game before they even reach level 20, all the looky loo's. One third of them, or maybe half of the people playing now? Bliz has quite a few years of experience with this kinda thing, this just happens to be their most successful launch yet. I'll wait it out to see how things are in a week or two and start judging whether they're doing the right thing. For now I'm trying to trust they have a better idea then any of us about what they can to create healthy long-term servers.
---
/r/RelevantXKCD/
---
Mage is also not as gear dependant as warlock so you can fuck some people up with just prebis
---
The twitch metrics on the beta were literally all you needed to know they needed at least double the number of servers they had.
---
Well, a few of us here at the office does at the very least.
---
You are not dps. You are dps-utility. Shine on you crazy boomkin. :)

To be fair you don't choose your cats, cats choose you. These are your cats bud, like it or not.

Perfect, Thanks for clearing that up. I just didnt want to get banned for using this.

iOS app as well.
---
If you look at Iron Forge from the outside, there are a dozen skyscraper-like protrusions from the mountain that are completely innaccesible. It's pretty obvious what we are looking at is merely the main thoroughfare of a much larger city.
---
Of course given the amount of agriculture in khaz-modan it would be a miracle if a large enough population could be supported to utilize 4 apartments.
---
Gets better at 60. Buckle up buckaroo
---
They don’t have to, it’s a video game not a court of law.
---
As long as there are queues, health is a distant concern.

That.... Is perfection. I am jealous.

If only that were true!
---
You went to buy shoes once you had bear form? Like why? Now you gotta walk like a dog wearing shoes for the first time.
---
server's already up for me
---
Just skip doing quests and grind mobs...
---
You didn't pay an extra £9.99 a month for premium access to skip queues? 
---
Heh, nothing personal kid *teleports in front of you in the queue*
---
Is pet pathing still bugged? Feels weird to me
---
work pc :)
---
Im still trying to find a clear answer if this is ok, 
---
this script stops you from logging out completely:
---
 /run local f=CreateFrame("Frame")f:RegisterEvent("PLAYER\_CAMPING")f:SetScript("OnEvent", function() local p=StaticPopup\_Visible("CAMP")\_G\[p.."Button1"\]:Click()end)
---
If you took whole week off you gotta plan around the queue times, log in at non peak times before the masses can. I work full time but I did log into Herod this morning before going into work for like 30 minutes. No queue. Swap your schedule a bit, don't stay up super late and just wake up early to get back on.
---
&gt; I haven't sat in a queue yet. Deviate Delight is a dead server in 2 weeks.  
---
FTFY  
---
have fun rerolling on a high pop server or paying for a char transfer when deviate delight is a ghost town
---
The REAL advantage comes when your kids are 11 and 9, wanna make Daddy happy, and gladly stare at that screen for you or log you in when youre at work and monitor the queue while youre gone.  
---
You think you got it made now? Wait til you have unpaid labor.
---
Good that it works for you. I done it once and i know what will happen if i will do it second time. All what i did in past lead to current state of my character and i am just excited to see where it will lead.
---
Rexxar is bigger than any Orc.
---
Guess it's a matter of preference. My favourite part of WoW was always level 10+. Having to do 1-10 3 times in two days just isn't enjoyable. Guess I may just have to wait a week or so to resub.
---
I tried to take a day off of work but this is the ONE week in maybe 2 or 3 years that I wouldn't be able to take a full day off because of obligations. The absolute most I can do is take the last half of Friday off...
---
That's a fair point, but the game systems still enable players to be anti-social and still complete their objectives. Classic, on the other hand, does not. Therefore you are forced to socialize in a way that you would probably not in Retail. That may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it doesn't change the facts of the matter.
---
Retail: Tasks that require social interaction are automated enough that I can ignore other players, selecting the exact difficulty and challenge I need to my skill level to accomplish my goals with or without social interaction.
---
Classic: Tasks are challenging enough to require either time or social interaction (or in many cases both) in order to complete thereby encouraging me to socialize in a way that I might not always be comfortable with.
---
If you're Alliance, lemme know and we can group up. It does feel like a lot of people are passing through and planning on going to their chosen servers later.
---
:) only just started on not classic my dad set up my account, my fallback name is davidhoffman

Back in the day hunters got a /rude running by.

Stop listening to people telling you to thunderclap. Not worth the rage vs threat investment and can’t be used in def stance. Spaghetti and Noobles

Upvoted for visibility of this Gaming Breaking issue.
---
You can't say that 100% in 4-5 months time there wont be population issues on your server, my original vanilla server (draenor eu) has been full or high pop for the last 15 years yet it was been HEAVILY horde populated horde populated when i played on it. I even looked up the realm stats for the first time in years (as i havent played on it since wotlk) to check i was still correct and whaddaya know, still 90% horde. 
---
imo blizzard should have always blocked character creation on the dominant faction of a realm until theres more of a balance. 
---
i would also like to point out that if there is a high pop and faction imbalance, you are completely fucked without server transfers because you cant really lose or gain players. a medium / low pop may at least have new people to tip the scales in their favour.
---
Tailor/Enchanter allows you to make Wands for yourself early on, sell/make bags for easy money and craft some really nice items.
---
I had the same experience! I’ve been opening trade with every low level warrior who passes and handing out my blacksmithing gear when honestly I should have sold it all. But then a warlock ran up to me in the barrens and handed me mail shoulders! Both experiences were so good that it’s hard to care too much about penny pinching.
---
Ya know, I was learning a bit of Korean for funzies for about a month.  I didn't actually learn much of anything but the alphabet. 
---
It made me realize just how many god damned useless constants we have. And how we are lacking some vowels.
---
- C is either just a K or a S depending.  
---
- The fact we have long and short sounds for the same vowel is dumb. They should just be separate letters.  
---
- Q is just a K and a vowel in a trench coat.  
---
- The fuck even is a X?  
---
- Z, and it's zaniness, are something the Koreans will never know and I'm glad it's around. Even if it is just a hamfisted S.
---
- I am glad we have R and L as separate letters, though.
---
Oh shut the fuck up
---
Paladin would like to have a few words
---
" if you employ people, you are not a loser "
---
You have a super charitable definition of "not a loser." I think there are likely a lot of real shit biscuit business owners out in the world that we could confidently call losers.
---

I think I need to switch servers because my experience so far has not at all been like you describe.  General chat has been abhorrent with dick jokes and people being rude if anyone makes the mistake of asking a question.  I refused a dual request yesterday and the dude came unglued and followed me around for thirty minutes calling me names and being an absolute jerk.  I ended up just shutting the game off for the night.
---
Very astute observations :)
---
&gt; Not a healer
---
But a hero
---
You want them to release so many servers that they are dead and require mergers in a month or two?
---
THIS IS CLASSIC YALL'S GRAPHICS SHOULD BE BLOCKY!
---
Hey, it is the Brown Linen Robe, tailoring skill 30.
---
Now you need a 3rd friend named “Actuallyido”.
---
Yeah I will never be on top of the dps meter, I dont care about that. Could shine in some dungeons but.. I mean the Warrior, its just the king of vanilla, i'm afraid I will just regret it and wont be able to do the amazing shit warriors can do in bgs :P
---
1 gold?! And here I am not buying new ranks of fire ball because i'm afraid of not having enough for my mount
---
For anyone wondering about the "Shortcut", follow his directions up to menethil harbor. At that point instead of taking the road toward Loch Modan, jump into the harbor and swim west (southwest) along the coast. Hug the coastline and just keep swimming west, well beyond the map transition, till you reach an inlet where your screen says "Dun Morogh". Once it says that, you are good to drown yourself and resurrect in a Dun Morogh graveyard.
---
There aren't servers without queues
---
I've had the entire MMO experience in the past 48 hours. 
---
I started skilling tailoring and enchanting and got above 75 this morning by handing out free enchants and linen bags for materials. Stood in Ironforge for a while, got traded 6 linen cloth, paid for thread and crafted four dozen linen bags. I always got tipped for being very friendly.
---
Explained the enchanting system and "will not be traded" slot to noobs and got a tip too. Found a nice guild - shoutout to *Defias Brotherhood*! - and made some friends. Some people even added me to be their "personal enchanter" because I'm nice.
---
Just getting tipped and being told "Hey, you're a nice person! I will add you and you can enchant my stuff in the future!" is more rewarding than any 450 titan forge I ever had.
---
Just the feeling of not being just another LFG random is very nice.
---
So your time is more valuable than someone who also has little time to play but sticks to the ToS and is stuck in queue? 
---
Fact is, if you are blocking a server slot while not actively playing, then you ruin someone else's evening. I hope that 5% drop quest item drops on the 200th mob for you.
---
HODL
---
Update: Xbox Game Bar was still checked somehow. Unchecking this fixed it
---
The main difference between classic and retail is that in classic you feel like apart of the world and all of it zones. I feel like an adventurer in Azeroth , in retail you are just trailing through the zones without challenge, becoming powerful enough to kill another, crazy God like creature
---
So talking about time investment, do you think you could clear nearly two Tempest Keep dungeons in about the same amount of time as one MOTHERLODE? Rather than talking about a literal number of trash mobs, the original point was "adding trash for time played metrics."

---
Hmm I already have the overlay off...
---
they don't neee to at all. this isn't federal court, this is "blizzard feels this is detrimental to the game". I feel it is likely they would ban for afk timeout avoiding scripts. I imagine that they put the afk timeout in the game to prevent people from sitting in realm all night to reserve a spot. I could be wrong tho... but i doubt it.
---
Except I'm pretty sure they meant separate hardware servers, which isn't layering at all.
---
It will pay off as things die down. The low pop servers will be barren.
---
Sounds like you will not be content until you are playing a boomkin, it’s a video game.. just play boomkin
---
Yeah I would knowing I'm in 2019 and all type of servers are scalable, hell we even have this little feature everybody cried about called "Layering".
---
So no, we are not IRL. Im not fucking anyone by reserving a spot in a server. Its like saying rich people are fucking everyone by reserving their spot on a fucking restaurant. In reality is much better, because its not "rich people" but people with half brain who knows their mouse have built-in functionalities in 2019.
---
Woh woh. Hold up.
---
There are servers with no queues and people are waiting for four hours to play?
---
Is this sub retarded?
---
I had the exact same, and then we decided to swap servers. -.-
---
I get what you're saying, but trust me when I tell you that you're wrong. If they added the micro transaction store to classic, people would quit in droves, it would be a terrible business decision. 
---
And trust me again when I tell you that Blizzard too knows this, so don't ever worry about micro transactions coming to classic :)
---
There are a few servers without queues, that i can log in and just play. Except i  can't
---
pretty sure you didnt know the release date 6 months ago
---
Alt f4 game thinks you dcD, get spot back
---
Thank you. I was getting very frustrated at 2AM last night haha.
---
Yeah probably, its exactly how I remember it and I'm glad its back and all but I can't force myself to grind through it again.
---
An alliance was forged..
---
Classic.wowhead.com had them yesterday haven’t checked today
---
Im from the private server scene, and yes, this is the way i like it. Get rekt
---
I haven't paid really any attention to General chat, I've been too focused. I haven't had any negative encounters yet though. What server are you on?
---
This is exactly what I did, I had my char name reserved, saw a big queue and immediately switched to another server, created my char and started playing right away.
---
Simply don't have the time to queue due to well, life.
---
I'd like two year seasons. A server wipe or grandpa servers where they 'put us out to pasture' where you cant roll new toons and we all need to restart every 2ish years.  
---
The game alone would keep me subbed and happy with that arrangement for over a decade. More if they created a separate ecosystem doing it with TBC.
---
Same here.  Alli NE starting zones seemed to be hunter, warrior, druids. I didn’t see one rogue in three hours of game time. Of course, I didn’t hover over everyone, just noticed what abilities they were using.
---
I never got to play classic aside from fishing for my father while he was at work but now I can’t even think about playing retail. This game is so much fun and it is so unbelievably nice to have a game where my character is important
---
He played a Shaman as well back in the day.
---
Sounds right. When in a dungeon, use the marks to assign CC. 
---
Like moon = sap, Circle = sheep, diamond = shackle etc 
---
And set skull for main target.
---
from my memories, paladin was slow and tedious and boring but less risky and dangerous than a warrior. All those heals+bubble made it quite safe

---
How dare someone sit in queue for 5 hours and then get food after finally logging in!!!!!!!!
---
Lmao dude, man up
---
The game is basically built on improving your character. You are whining about the opposite the minmaxers are crying about. Two peas in a pod.
---
But if blizzard offers us free transfers however will they sell us 25 dollar transfers in a few weeks?
---
If I'm reading this correctly, phase 2 doesn't have an exact date? They do say that 
---
&gt;Phase 2 will definitely not start before there is only one layer per server.
---
So hopefully it is something they can scale over time and not just a sudden drop off. What server do you play on?
---
Is there a working version. I loaded mine up yesterday and it had a bunch of lua errors. No chance I was logging out to fix it last night lol.
---
I’m a casual RPer. I don’t write some elaborate backstory for my character, I just like to act like a Tauren in casual /say conversation and occasionally join an event or whatever. That’s most of RP on most servers; don’t feel like you need to be 24/7 in character.
---
Ok, so what you got?
---
roomates that play Classic WoW and don't even roll together. That's odd AF.
---
That’s my jam
---
Fuck up by blizz their solution is just change servers. Difficult if you cannot gain all your friends. Same situation i m in.
---
At least mid to high

It's amazing how the guy who introduced me to gaming videos online and my first mmorpg are still relevant some 15 years later, keeping it very close to their roots.
---
Yes, I've see people spamming it in the newbie zones but I don't have the time to do anything with it as when I'm able to play I spend most of my time waiting in queue.
---
I almost reinstalled retail wow until i realized it was installing 52gb. Switched to install classic and it took like 2 mins. Good ole basic classic
---
Preach!
---
been in q nearly 2 hours, still at 11308
---
Gotcha, yeah. I think likely mostly caused by fewer auctions rather than cheaper auctions.
---
And also the home of the best guild in the world ^(with a name a bit like Immortalis)
---
At least you are not waiting in Q
---
Well they could raise the capacity, which would then obviously crank up the layers, but his point remains. 
---
The purpose of layering isn't to drastically increase server capacity. They have to get people off the megaservers, and letting everyone in is a pretty good way to guarantee everyone stays.
---
I see lots of whining about Blizzard not having faith in their game but that seems contradictory to their actions. If they believed everyone was going to quit they would just ramp up the server capacities and let everyone play on Herod or Whitemane or whatever just to shut people up since they'll all be gone next month. 
---
They clearly are hedging that tons of people are here to stay, that's why they're resisting band aid fixes like increasing server capacities temporarily.
---
People are so fucking stubborn though... they'll probably have to look at some other methods of... enticing... people to man up and play on another server. Maybe setting up a new server specifically for free migration of existing characters off overcrowded ones. 
---
This sub's constant  fearmongering about empty servers and shitty advice telling people they won't have fun unless they play on a megaserver probably isn't helping.
---
From what I remember, if you like having about 50 to 60 key bindings, then definently go war lol
---
This is a quality meme. More Trailer Park Boys ones please

---
Alarm will be set for 5.00am saturday morning. I'll beat the queues and play all. damn. day.

And people say there's no RP and no social aspect of retail...
---
Death to the Horde.
---
You can just Q for the new realms.. Most people are only in their 20s from spending hours in the game. You still have a chance lol.
---
Jesus fucking Christ, I wish I had that time
---
I am entitled to get access to the game though : I paid. That's why I gave them money in the first place. Blizzard are not delivering.
---
If I ever not delivered something I'm paid for in my everyday job, I would 1000x more shit than just a comment by the "whiney entitled brat" who fucking paid me.
---
Boars are top tier pets imo. That charge attack is so nice.
---
If I can ever get on when I'm able to play, I'll try.
---
Thats for staying in game while at work, while others can't get into game for 6hrs are more
---
Only played wow classic in a private server 2017. Just till lvl 30. It was mindumbing.
---
I *wanted* them to release high pop servers and proactively merge them when/if necessary so they don't become dead.
---
In the end, a 16k layered server, losing 75% pop and becoming one server is pretty similar economically to two 8k non-layered servers losing 75% pop and merging to become one server, especially if the merge is done ASAP.  The only difference is that the layered server will have an economy rife with abuse, and all the issues with immersion and community that come with layering.
---
Something something Russian servers.
---

---
In the weeks before launch we formed a group based on friends of friends, and ended up with 200+ people to form a guild. Just a few actually got into the server we chose at launch, while the rest spread on other servers. We cant just move 200ppl to another server when some started already. A few are simply waiting for ques to calm down, while others actually abandoned the group to play other servers. 
---
What worried me is that there might be A LOT of people thinking like us; playing on random servers in wait to reroll to the server that they actually planned to play with their friends on. If that is the case, then we got lots of servers worth of players about to reroll to the original servers. I got a feeling this isnt going to calm down anytime soon unless blizz comes up with something smart.
---
&gt;I'm confused. You patronized the idea of spinning up tons of servers and having tiny pops down the road but when you entertain the concept on raising the cap you seem to think it won't shrink at all? 
---
No need to be, it's true that population will shrink down--but there will always be servers that are incredibly popular--it's an issue for those. Your solution would make it so that it would be more likely that these servers form, since it would be easier to get onto a very popular server with increasing use of layering tech in phase 1. Imagine the population sizes of the streamer server if you opened the flood gates with full layering.
---
Using the queue, and adhering to the vanilla population size mentality will ensure a much better spread of players across different servers.
---
No it won't  and that's why they haven't done that. It didn't work in the past and won't work now.

Ahh! I didn't know if you had some secret strat for leveling or acquiring mats that I was unaware of. 
---
I mean it's impressive that you finally made it, but I thought I was missing something for a minute
---
I think you should have read this more carefuly. At no point did I say these were all great reasons, but it doesn't change the fact that thousands of people have these views which is why they aren't swapping realms.
---
&gt;Here are my main reasons **why people aren't switching realms** as much as Blizzard would like them to:
---
&gt;Even the low and medium population servers have tens of thousands of people on them. It's highly unlikely that any of them die. What's more likely is that the servers that people are refusing to leave will still have too many people on them when phase 2 comes around and will still have huge queues when layering is turned off.
---
I'm not saying myself that they will die, however that doesn't change the fact that thousands of people do think that it's a possibility, which is why they aren't swapping realms. 
---
&gt;Blizzard has also been warning people for quite awhile now that some servers were going to be completely overloaded and opened up new servers quite frequently even before launch, and even moreso after launch. Also, is it more important to you to have a specific common name or to actually play the game?
---
It's almost like you didn't read this:
---
&gt;With a game that's so focused on the community aspect, it is perfectly valid for people to care about their IGN.
---
Once again, it's not a problem that affects me, however that doesn't invalidate it. Do you not think people should be able to get their names and play the game? 
---
&gt;And those friends and/or guilds should have considered the experience of their friends and/or guild members from the beginning. If a few people made it in while everyone else was sitting in an 8 hour queue then those that made it in should probably have been willing to move to another server with a lower queue so they could all have a better experience. This is a case of people being selfish and stubborn.
---
Or it's a case of "I've got work and other responsibilites to take care of this week but I'll catch you guys on the weekend". 
---
&gt;Yes, but would you rather sit in an 8 hour queue or a 3-4 hour queue? That's all that really matters in this regard.
---
Neither. While I know it's launch and queues are to be expected, the fact that you are happy with sitting in a four hour queue to play a game you paid for blows my mind.
---
&gt;How exactly would that have fixed anything? Even with the number of servers they started with people in both NA and EU were congregating on one or two servers and mostly ignoring the others. Blizzard even warned people about it and that they should consider playing on one of the other realms instead but people ignored it. Starting off with even more servers for reservations likely wouldn't have changed that since people were already ignoring the other server options. On top of that, Blizzard steadily added more servers leading up to the release *and* released quite a few more servers on release, but people still refused to switch to them even before actually getting to play.
---
You do know they only started with two ENEU PvP realms right? What do you mean "ignoring the others". There weren't any. It seems like you're missing the whole idea behind my post, which was to say why people aren't swapping. I am giving you the reasons for this:
---
&gt;Blizzard steadily added more servers leading up to the release *and* released quite a few more servers on release, but people still refused to switch to them
---
&gt;People on the overpopulated servers ignored the new servers they opened up anyways, didn't even try to get whatever names they wanted on them. Also, maybe people should use more unique names. I've had no trouble whatsoever getting the name I wanted without rushing to reserve anything.
---
You have to realize not every single player is like you. I didn't have trouble reserving my names either, but a lot of people do/did. Are you unaware that there are literally bots taking popular names as soon as possible, or when someone deletes a character to recustomize them?
---
Im just here waiting for the guy that freaked out about all these wrong spellings of queue the other day...
---
You don't have to use all of that every week.  Just nice to be prepared.
---
Your experience is not universal. One would hope you'd have realized this by age 5.
---
If you think blizzard has their act together then you proved my point about you
---
CompLETELY agree.  I've already made 5 or 6 new friends questing. The struggle and necessity to form a group to complete certain quests has made the social aspect of classic MUCH better than any version of WoW I've played over the past decade.
---
Thanks guy
---
I just did this quest solo as a Rogue. I died atleast 7 times and it took almost an hour.
---
Average income+average age+average cost of living ... once you know that it’s trivial to figure out
---
Now that classic is available in retail, we need to stop referring to the current expansion as retail. 
---
Modern or current could work.

---
&gt; There's no reason why estimated queue times have drop to &lt;1 minute
---
A pretty reasonable explanation for this is that "&lt;1 minute" is the default text, and sometimes the queue server gets too swamped to give back an actual estimate to everybody. With the size of queues we're seeing it's not unreasonable that the queue server would sometimes have issues like that. Far better than it just dropping people from the queue anyway.
---
I did the quests in vanilla, and while there's a lot involved for both classes, they're far easier to obtain for warlocks and paladins than they are for classes that have to farm a ton for them.
---
I can agree. I do enjoy seeing creative uses of the phrase or similar phrases, but not so much to spite the person who said it anymore.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
A ton of wows fanbase are toxic and immature not sure why any of this surprises you.
---
Alright, the next hour its my turn to repost. Respect the queue.
---
I'd probably blur the open Azure tenant on his left screen.
---
Why would it die down?
---
Commenting to save

Kinda sounds like gambler's fallacy; do you screw others over, or do you take one for the team?
---
"Your wait time is under a minute"
---
45 minutes later: "your wait time is under a minute"
---
Nah, I was mostly replying to the latter part about discovering things, which we've all already discovered 15 years ago.
---
I completely agree that information that is easy to look up should be in game, and even said so in my original comment, saying that at least questing add-ons make it so people focus on the game, as opposed to tabbing out to look that very info up.
---
The issue with your solid napkin math is two X factors.
---
One being, how long are people going to stay online.
---
Another being, how long are people before you in Queue willing to wait before they give up.
---
As queue times seem to drop around 11pm as people are logging off for the night who have a regular morning job. And also queues move fairly quickly until the last bit of it. 
---
I moved from 13k to 3k in queue fairly steadily paced. Once I got to 3k, it was barely moving. like 250 after an hour... It didn't pick up the pace until around 11-12 at night when people sign off for bed.
---
WHAT EVEN IS THE POINT OF THAT
---
Bears have taunt?
---
The amount of time I've moved up in the queue.. Christ.
---
This is good advice. I'm just going to play and explore and take in the scenery
---
You should be able to click the Questie icon near your mini map to enable/disable or change features.
---
If the current population cap is the same as a non layered server, 10% of that population is 2.9k, almost a full server. If they doubled it, that already puts us at 3.2k.
---
The devs wanted layers to avoid dead servers after the dropoff and avoid queues, so I think that estimating +6k concurrent players is a pretty conservative numbers
---
Well I enjoy it, so ill do me, you do you.
---
&gt;Shame the idea of offering free realm transfers from high to low pop down the road or merging multiple smaller pop servers down the road isn't an option like it used to be
---
We've come full circle. As has been mentioned before, that solution has a bunch of problems as well. 
---
It clashes with blizzard's idea of not disrupting realm communities with realm transfers(they've mentioned this multiple times). But more importantly on a technical level you have to solve the name issue.
---
Are you ready to sacrifice your character's name for the greater good of the realm? Should blizzard implement a first come first serve policy? Should it be a coinflip to decide who gets the name? So much for early name reservations.
---
Oh and I don't care about the name thing, but it's an issue for some people which means blizzard has an actual technical problem to solve. I do think realm transfers would be the best thing to do, but I can't fault blizzard for being careful.
---
The best solution I can see is for blizzard to keep doing what they're doing, that way when the hype dies and population sizes go down they'll have an actual proper estimate of demand. Blizzard would ideally also give people free gametime in recompense for queue times and server availability.

---
The queue gets you to the character screen. You can log out and swap characters on the same server without seeing a queue. There is also a ~5 minute grace period that allows you to exit the game completely and log back in with no queue if you want to do something with addon files. Unfortunately, the grace period does not apply to world crashes, client crashes, or DCs.
---
i dont bitch bout no ques cas im always online, but because of the ques my guild got separated on 2 realms, i was askin bout transfer not bitchin bout no ques, and i did not burnt myself out of the game for leveling alot of alts, because im playin since 05, and i can assure you i leveled more than 1000 characters, i just wanna play on my first char created and transfer afterwards, sum ppl jumps to conclusions so fast on god
---
one thing to note, on pvp realms, horde outnumbers alliance by varying margins. Not sure if that matters to you or not.
---
Sorry misread you then . Its called retail and classic because blizz started it afaik. If you look under wow subfolders you will find them seperated into classic and retail
---
Yes and no.
---
The more hybrid DPSers in a group, the more your specialized DPSers will have to carry. It's all numbers. Most guilds/groups are not gonna care if there's a bunch of Ret Paladins or Cat Druids, but there is a tipping point.
---
Yeah I'm having a hard time setting up good keybinds cause I've been used to playing DotA for 10 years since Wrath lol

This is obviously not my wow name..

I've done stonetalon once. and not even completely until I went back for Loremaster during Wrath... Noooo thank you lol. I just go there for the FP then off to Desolace lol
---
Unfortunately, I saw a post on /r/hearthstone where there was a reply from Blizzard customer service where they said "we don't do refunds"
---
I help any Hordies I can. At the end of the day, we're on the same team :)
---
I've been playing on Kurannaxx and have only been in queue once on the first day for 10 min. Last night I came home at 10pm server time and jumped right in without queue. 
---
My friends originally wanted to play on Fairbanks, but turns out we don't actually like waiting in a queue for hours so we just rolled here and it's been great.
---
questie isnt even showing up in the folder for me
---
Yeah those gnome paladins sure are nasty.
---
Wireless, but it has nothing to do with the internet. It has been working perfectly all the time. When I was queued yesterday I changed wifi and my queue time was still saved, so why did I get reset now?
---
So... if you have extra mouse buttons this is what I do. 
---
I have two extra up/dn buttons on my mouse so Iopened keybindings and set bottom left bar 1 and 2 to be those two extra mouse buttons. 
---
My mouse click up is assigned to a macro that has /cast Hunter's Mark and /pet attack
---
My mouse click down is ranged auto attack on/off.
---
So from whatever range, I'll mark and have my pet run in and then as soon as I get in range I'll click the other button to start auto shot. As soon as first auto goes off I serpent sting and auto til dead.
---
Repeat.
---
All that time wasted in the WoW Killers (Warhammer: Online, SWTOR, Rift, Elder Scrolls and many more I can't even name and here I am much older and back to WoW again.

well that's cuz Noggenfogger is a badass name =D

Legit, I'm gonna log on early on Saturday morning, and probably show my son how to play. Let him level a character for a bit and I'm on all day then 😂 otherwise it's log on at midday so it's ready for when he goes to bed
---
&gt;How many stress tests did they do?
---
Better question is how many people actually joined in on the stress tests. I know I was the only one in my guild after the first one. I have this odd feeling there weren't nearly as many people participating as the classic fanbase thinks.
---
Well I got some others to come with me

We don't have all day to play like my Herod friends do so..yeah the 2 hours of free time ain't gonna be in queue

Why would you be against new content in the spirit of vanilla? Anyways, private servers were flawed and not "true" vanilla either.
---
They will need 90% of the people playing right now to quit to be able to get rid of layers.  
---
The best game ever made needs to have less than 11% retention rate or blizzards gamble fails.
---
I dont like those odds.
---
How does respec work in wow? If I wanted to play priest, can I level as the faster shadow priest and then swap to holy for endgame heals? Sorry never played wow before
---
Interesting. Can you elaborate if you just straight up remote desktop'd from your phone/work out of a fresh install or is there anything you configured? - When I say configured I mean something which could fuck it up. Such as going to lock screen when you stop the remote control, or maybe shutting the computer off? I can't seem to find any settings which indicate this, but just making sure. I'm currently sitting in a queue on my desktop so I can't test it myself right now.

I hate the dwarf aesthetic though xD

My character is locked out from the game. I joined a group and immediately as it tried changing my layer it made it so I could run around but not interact with anything or cast any spells. I could still see chat. I restarted the client and now it gets 2/3rds way through loading. Other characters work fine.

Yeah they should of started with two. But again same strategy would need to be applied.

Carry on amigo! Your antics are appreciated
---
There have been constant shutdowns to both kick AFK'ers and reset layers. My point is: people want layering to go away, and also they all want to play in the same handful of servers. These two things are contradictory to each other, yet people are being irrational and don't want to move to newer servers, calling them DOA. I believe the queue system is there to force people out, and that high population servers will keep layering and/or high queue times for a long time and everybody's gonna be pissed about it.
---
Shadow Council Alliance and Proudmoore Horde, both NA.
---
Also, increasing que w/ time.  Lower position.... longer wait

Are we literally just re-posting this multiple times per day now? Lol.
---
 I just see all these other server they keep making having issues by phase 2 maybe.
---
 But I understand what your saying. Thanks!
---
we can speak freedomlanguage pretty well :)
---
I mean over 15 years every small change has transformed it.
---
Think of it growing up with a sibling, as you live with them and grow with them things change but you don't necessarily notice it.
---
Then imagine not seeing your sibling for 15 years, the change is noticeable because you have a frame of reference.
---
So every patch 5 or 10 things change and it's turned it into the ADD dream it is now
---
Weird flex but ok
---
pvp you da
---
Yea calling someone kookoo originated from the kookoo bird, not the sound owls make. Not sure where he got that info but it's incorrect
---
There is really no alternative if you want a population to play on. 
---
Just wait a week and it'll be better.
---
Weekends? Still will probably have queues, yes, but I dont understand the catering to people that only are able to play a few hours a week.
---
That's how we got to retail in the first place.
---
I'm dying laughing at this picture and sound.
---
God I'm on lunch break rn and have nothing but my hardhat...
---
I'm enjoying classic again, but I feel like a lot of stuff is getting overstated. Its cool that people are helpful, but its also necessary if you don't want to be waiting on named mobs to spawn. And its easier since everyone is pretty densely packed right now. I think that will dissipate with time. And the nice folks are fantastic when they're around, but I've already seen general chats devolve into holocaust denial and "the civil war wasn't about slavery" shit fests.
---
Minor pet peeve of mine is seeing the same conversation every 10 minutes:
---
&gt;Person 1: I casted 3 "Spell name"s and I'm already oom. And I'm loving it!!!
---
&gt;Person 2: right!?
---
Meanwhile I'm salty a raptor one level above me killed me because I got parried/dodged/resisted/missed 7 times in a row. :(
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying the trip down memory lane and the experience overall, but the warts still show from time to time.
---
So we back in the mine
---
I doubt it since multi-boxing apparently isn't. If is that would be really strange.
---
Agreed that's what I'm saying not being championship on of the horde although that be cool.
---
There is NO reason IMO to rush this game. I’m taking it all in. This isn’t happening ever again. Not on this scale at least. Why race to 60?
---
5 servers isnt enough for 500k people? Who would have figured.
---
Blizzard will only compensate if EVERYONE can't play. There are plenty of people who have been playing this whole time.
---
Just wait a week and the queues will be better.
---
Their plan is to not open enough servers for everyone to play because they don't want to spend time and money later on merging lower population servers.
---
Then when this backfires they open the small amount of new servers that always end up full with long ques.  
---
Repeat process every day
---
You can also ask a city guard and they'll add a map marker more most of the important people/places.
---
Just try eu servers with 8 hr queue

There is no truth to what is entertaining.
---
Is that Ted Cruz?
---
And this is why I'm going to wait a month or so before hopping in, less people questing and more doing endgame stuff
---
My coworker is the most hard core of nerds.  He got into WoW a couple years ago (into computer gaming from table top, dude is still a top level magic player,  and has top 50 ranks in d3 and hearthstone), he'd been trying to get me back into wow (I left after tbc, after playing since patch 1.2.2) all through legion, I finally caved a couple weeks into bfa.  Took me about 10 days to grind up a new character on his server,  and in those ten days he'd lost interest in bfa, citing "it's pretty clear you're just grinding for bigger numbers,  the mechanics and skill factor just aren't there. It comes down to are you're numbers bigger than the bosses"  he loved the world pvp, but that was the only thing he says he misses.   And there are other games that do world pvp much better than WoW with its realm hopping. 
---
I'm trying to get him to go classic,  I know he'd love the experience,  but I gotta wait for the queues to go down
---
Haha. Were you in whitemane? Cause I got a bag from the person I think
---
Not the version that i'm using anyway. There are some things you can enable/disable but not really they way I want. For example you can turn on/off showing things on the minmap/zone map but it turns on/off everything including the question marks/exclamation points. I just want to turn off everything EXCEPT the question mark/exclamation point. If there's a way to do that I haven't figure it out.
---
Minutes to hours.  Not long at all.
---
Reminds me of people in the beta who would be like "hey leveling warrior isn't so bad what was everyone talking about" cuz things were going great at level 6.
---
Looks like it’s a retextured quiver, albeit unfinished. I’d report the bug.
---
i think the lower pops will start to get traffic thou as people get fed up with the full / high pop queue times
---
Yeah...
---
Those damn FA/Cooking/Fishing tomes to hit Journeyman across the world, then those damn quests to get Artisan lol
---
Shadow priest has a lot of synergy. Mage works well too and is a bit simpler.
---
What stuff specifically? I haven’t played Warcraft 3 in ages and would like to know what sounds I’ve associated with WoW for so long are actually from Warcraft 3.
---
I grind to keep up on professions and make money. Selling stuff on AH is basically worthless for the first 2-4 weeks. So I grind to keep up on gold flow and be able to buy my 40 mount when I hit 40. Also grinding helps explore the map you in more deeply. Teaches you how to use each of your skills as well.
---
They wouldn't though if Blizzard would be able to solve the problems at hand.
---
It's like you people don't even read the post.
---
why would you promote this, just gonna make it harder for everyone
---
When what's once entertaining is twisted and forcibly taken away from you, then yes, yes there is a truth to that.
---
I remote desktop in from work then chat with my friends and jump around Stormwind until I'm home. Never sitting in a queue again.
---
It has been a long time since I last seriously played, but playing retail it is frustratingly easy. Getting massive amounts of xp and levels just because I dual specced mining/herbalism was ridiculous.  I would have a log of 6 quests and they turned from orange to green by the time I was about to turn them all in.
---
That's my logic behind staying on Whitemane, well that and my entire guild/friends/family are committed to that server so there is zero choice in the matter.
---
Be  Human warrior like everyone else
---
Everyone on earth except for one small Ethiopian village.
---
There won’t be as many mage mains as you think. Many people level them purely as gold making machines.
---
It's honestly getting fucking annoying. My guild's greeting message is "You think you do, but you don't" and it gets spammed in /1 anytime anybody asks about queues...
---
I've already swapped servers twice and I'm still on a full server, for fuck sake.
---
Cooking, fishing and first aid are all secondary professions. You can learn all 3 and still learn 2 primary professions on top of it.
---
Oh my god that is so smart I was just using the highest ranked one wtf

Probably want to just pick the one that fits your style. I played a hunter whose main focus was just wearing down casters till I could pop viper string when they were at 5% mana. It wasn’t the meta build at the time but it fit my play style and I rarely lost V’s a clothie and picked my battles.
---
Every EU English server is full right now, except maybe one rppvp one (I can't check for sure or I'll lose my spot in the queue.) 70 mins wait right now. 
---
I got in an hour after launch within 2 minutes, and last night with no queue, not sure what's happened here. Maybe 5/6pm is the worst time as everyone is just back from work?
---
Nope, all you have to do is enter your computer ID on the phone app "teamviewer".

Prestige, world wide recognition, satisfaction. Everything is not about money.
---
i feel his pain..
---
Im just curious how those Chinese do it. Is it like 25 cents for them? Since they get paid like literal 10 cents an hour working at a factory. Maybe try to use a VPN to download their version of the game
---
Can u delete this you’re just making queues bigger
---
Meh, its not to bad. Give you time to do the adult things or other hobbies. While in queue, I've:
---
Cooked for the week
---
Cleaned dishes and the kitchen
---
Painted warhammer models
---
Applied for new jobs 
---
Gone to the gym
---
Paid Bills 
---
Drank
---
Instead of vendor or AH I give my cooked food to warrior because there lvling experience sucks
---
I love blowing people up in pvp, what are the bursty casters in pvp? From what I heard balance druids and shadow priests are about DoT, I'm alliance so no shaman, which is more bursty, warlock or mage?
---
My group rerolled on Noggenfogger to get away from the Golemagg queue... now Noggenfogger has a 3hr queue too. Cool.
---
*Back to classicqueue
---
Even if it takes 2 weeks you’re missing half of a monthly subscription that you’re paying for. Also Blizzard is using AWS, which hosts massive platforms like Netflix and Spotify which without a doubt have many more concurrent users than WoW Classic.

This is against the ToS my g not that smart of a move.

By keeping my wand up to date, do you mean buying a new one from the auction house every now and then?
---
1. This debate is purely subjective. There will be people on both sides with a good argument for why they prefer their game. 
---
2. Does that make sense, or should I get real condescending with ya buddy?
---
Druid would be a decent companion.
---
Because, trying to get a honest evaluation of exactly what to expect.
---
Normal go live I would expect a month of queues, but then reasonable after that, but now I'm thinking every layer, is basically a server go live,  A huge servers are going to have to wait for every layer to collapse, retriggering bigger queues again and again and again.
---
Decent bois
---
What is funny is that people use autistic shit like kappa outside twitch.
---
Keep doing what you're doing. Bouncing back and forth is key unless you want to dungeon grind. I've gone (from lvl 11) Darkshore&gt;Westfall&gt;RR&gt;Darkshore&gt;Ashenvale&gt;RR just because as you said the level gaps are weird.
---
thats the one!
---
This morning at 8  AM PST i was able to get onto Whitemane no problem, create a few placeholder characters, then back to Pagle. Before work at like 8:40AM PST ish, I tried to log into Whitemane, 2500 player queue lol
---
That's how I remember it too. But a single channel for ALL trade, recruiting, gold farmers (which I hope will remain a non-issue but let's be real, AND groups is a little, wildly annoying.
---
what is he talking about? he's absolutely right. the endgame in classic is not what influenced the game's design. leveling is what influenced the game's design. the endgame was an afterthought they didn't have any idea what to do with, which is why they made so many changes over time
---
Not sure as I’m on EU. Checked wowhead for server status ?
---
It still isn't, if you're trying to complete a crowded quest and not just moving on you're intentionally gimping yourself for OCD's sake
---
Lol my name is Cowfarts and I'm a Tauren.. I guess I never really grew up.
---
Paladin/Shaman were Alliance/Horde exclusive in vanilla.
---
They have a spell that deals high amount of threat  [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5676/searing-pain](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5676/searing-pain) 
---
They can cast this a couple of times before they start life draining to have some aggro on the mob.
---
People are just eager to play.
---
Yeah but they cant do that forever
---
try it out and see what it's like.  If you don't like it in an hour pick something else.
---
Well he obviously sees he will be getting help from 10,000 other wanderers so
---
His entire account was worth 6 Wow tokens?
---
That's pretty low. Being generous that's only 2mil max. Min is probably 1mil.
---
Look they don’t sit there laughing im still not sure if they made a mistake yet. They want to keep a Server stability long term and they cant guarantee that with adding 100 Servers. They are trying there best to make it good. No huge Game has a good launch week just Look at COD or League of Legends with TFT. Its sad but idk how to solve the Problem Long Term but im sure they do.
---
&gt; When about 50% of the people will leave, there won't be anymore queues but there will still be very populated realms, save for a couple.
---
If 50% of people leave by Phase 2, then Herod will still have an hour+ queue on a Wednesday morning if they remove layering. What did you base this off of?
---
&gt; A game retaining its population from launch is unprecedented.
---
I can think of at least one precedent. It's actually very similar to the game we are talking about now. Do you think you can guess which game not only retained its population but actually grew its population by orders of magnitude after its launch? Again, it is *very* similar to WoW Classic.
---
&gt;I never played WOTLK when it was new
---
A think a lot of long-timers would agree that outside of the honeymoon period of Vanilla, WotLK was golden-era WoW. Everything just came together so perfectly.
---
This is great, please keep it up.
---
I just did a Deadmines run and my friendslist is suddenly 4 people larger. I didn't even notice that we took an hour lol.
---
imagine taking time off of work for a video game lmfao
---
Engineering is pretty good for pvp especially for a shaman
---
Guess i do have to train cooking then!
---
Unless you want to spend over 2 hours in the starter zone, that's kind of what you have to do. I was leveling with a friend and it still took us over an hour to get to Brill. That's with 2 of us tagging. If I was camping a spot and somebody else tagged the mob, I would help kill it because it helps everyone to help things spawn faster.
---
the name of a server bothers you? really dude
---
Thanks for making the queue times longer ass hole.
---
Dont know about hunters in classic, but my gnome warr could do his lvl 10 warr quest at NE zone. If the NE hunter trainer in Dolanar (i think the city name is), then you proberly have to go back to dwarf area (Kharanos)
---
*#JAY WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT BRO*
---
It might not be the best, but for those who haven't gotten back into classic yet - they've said it was nicely done and was a flashback to the early 2000s
---
Absolutely would
---
I remember early in wrath days I saw posts that were like "I helped a blizzard employee move and he gave me this" and there was a picture of like a 50 year time card or something like that. Memories fuzzy.
---
Always wondered if those were real.
---
And barrens can be walked across in a matter of 15 minutes. Not only is it not possible to make a absolute 1:1 scale of the world, but it is impractical from a gameplay standpoint. 
---
Personally I would love to see a remake of the entire world where the zones are far more open with more to be explored...but it might not translate to an enjoyable gaming experience.
---
They need to fix this asap. All those thousands players paid to play, they deserve better servers.
---
Personally I didn't pay for a name and I will not pay to be in a queue.
---
&gt;They're not going to drop off anytime soon.
---
 We don't know that yet. Instead of making hasty decisions, let's give it a few weeks and see what happens. Not even been 2 days yet
---
Yes. You have to use a mouse recorder and record yourself logging in. Because they randomly kick people from the server throughout the day to kick anti-afkers, but if you bot yourself to log in, you got the grace period.
---
I'm not in a rush to 60, so lets have some fun!
---
Night elf here waiting for that shaman charm to drop.
---
Just noticed Kenny is playing on a biege tower with a CRT, while everyone else has lcds.  So much attention to detail.
---
I'm pretty sure the realms aren't hardware servers anymore. New realm or new layer would result in the same hardware load with some overhead for layering.
---
If they guaranteed  1 server transfer I think a lot of problems would go away... for now
---
Same for me in Brill! I accidentally spent around 5 hours sitting around crafting bags, only ended up dinging 3 times because of it haha.
---
Helpful news- thank you!
---
Turns out when a game doesn't spoon-feed you gear and convenience, a meaningful experience emerges.
---
I’ll see Blizz devs fighting tooth and nail against it, with maybe some leaving the team voluntarily, but at the end of the day Corporate always wins.
---
I will be canceling my sub the day micro-transactions make their way into the game.
---
Please delete this. We don't need longer queues.
---
I'm in a similar situation. Started as a rogue in TBC but am playing a lock now. It's slow and hard compared to the game that Retail is today, and I like it! 
---
Feels like I'm earning each item/spell/level, and every choice matters.
---
I rolled a hunter after my friends logged Monday. Dinged 10 and tamed a boar.
---
Whats that little frowney face next to his unit?
---
FUUUCK I totally forgot I had to feed this needy cocksucker!
---
Memories =D
---
How is that automated, do you even know what remote viewer is? It's just so you can move the screen from another device
---
There’s 8.2.3 for Classic too.
---
Top kek
---
How is that funny? Explain.
---
Contrary for me: classic made me realize how much i love the fast pace, conveniencies and collections from retail.
---
Not that i love BFA, its still a bad expension.
---
Because some people DID play on day one and day two and don't want to reroll AGAIN
---
Cave moss is a delicacy
---
Mine didnt work until I turned gathermate off.
---
Final confirmation we needed that Dwarf Pallies are superior to their Human counterparts.
---
What is there to mock?
---
This post #89947 Many thanks for your imput, but that's exactly copy paste of what ppl are saying for years.
---
The best thing about classic is that people are constantly communicating. Be it in global or local. Having people ask you for help with a mob or ask directions. It happened to some degree in retail but not at all like I've experienced so far in classic. I love it.
---
Which server?
---
I would suggest neither for solo.  If you are dedicated to being solo and want to have an easy ride to 60 choose a hybrid class or a pure dps class.  I would suggest a Warlock for you my friend.  The most needed guy in the raid is the guy that can summon. 
---
For alliance I would say Warlock, Mage, Pally, Rogue, Hunter,  Druid, Priest, Warrior will be most in demand.  
---
The core of your raid team is your main tank and then your different officers so you can bet that the melee DPS and Healing Officers are going to play Priests and Warriors and they will want to recruit as few people as possible to compete with for gear
---
Yepp. Definitely blind. Thanks!
---
Here's the thing though. If blizzard drops layers and tunes queues to only keep 10% of the playerbase, that in itself will be a factor driving the other 90% away. They're just setting up it to fail
---
Or you can just ignore retail, and we can all keep this sub relevant for what it was created for. 
---
Every other post is some dumb "better than retail"-post. Classic is good enough to stand on its own two legs without comparison.
---
Pointing out things to hate in retail just makes you all look petty.
---
Have an upvodka
---
I think you missed the point of the show if you are just viewing the superheroes as copies of existing characters. Also, the powers might be the same but literally everything else about the characters is different.
---
I get that they are the same subscription but the fact you can't play retail while waiting out Classic queue makes me "???"
---
you mean Faerlina.
---
Last time i checked, in the mornings, Faerlina is the only high realm, Herod is medium pop, and the rest are low pop.
---
sure. I chose Gehennas for the only reason that the majority of the K3 and LH chose this server. People i’ve been playing vanilla from 2015 to 2019 and i intend to keep playing with them and not with BFA dudes. You say split the server, i say FUCK NO. Those that cannot handle the queue are welcome to reroll to an other realm.

What is the burst combo locks have?
---
&gt;afternoon
---
I started at 11am today (ie not a weekend-ish day) and I'm sat at 3900 still at 5.30pm... you're going to want to get in queue before you leave for work on friday.
---
Might be the only solution at stage 2, yes.
---
But why would people transfer by then when they are not doing it now?
---
I don't get it -- I play both and enjoy both. They are two separate games, apples &amp; oranges.
---
Retail has very difficult end game content, both raiding and mythic+. Classic has that OG feel, community, and leveling experience.
---
Why do we have this "my game is better than your game!" Childlike mentality?
---
I remember when Final Fantasy 14 came out and I started playing. A few weeks in, I was trying to get my boss to play. He was a longtime FF11 player. He seemed like the was open to it, he bought the game, even bought a PC for it, installed it, but never really played. After a while he said "they really need to give you something for having max level characters on FF11. I spent so many years of work on that game." now, he didn't know what he wanted, he just felt he deserved something for all that time spent on FF11, redeemed in FF14.
---
I told him flat out, "That isn't work, its a game. Your reward for it is the time spent playing, having fun, etc. You don't deserve a reward for playing a fucking video game." Mind you, we worked in a bank. This was a grown, 37 year old man who felt entitled because he played FF11 on his Xbox 360 for like 5 years. He never came around, and literally played FF11 until they shut the servers down in 2017 or so.
---
I won't say I don't understand, but if you feel like that then you seriously lack perspective. Don't let your possessions own you, folks.
---
Then you haven't played for very long, assholes have always existed.
---
Play what you like to look at, it'll be totally fine.
---
I agree with everything you said. I’ll see you in the queue...
---
Outside of the Foundry were really any other raids good?  I mean it only had 3 which in itself is pretty shit for an expansion.  Highmaul was okay and Hellfire Citadel I thought was pretty garbage.  Foundry by itself can't save it in my opinion.
---
on Rattlegore, PVP server.
---
What is the combo?
---
If your not a number cruncher your good.
---
I cant beleive people are even waiting to begin with....the 20k of you waiting to get in one server makes up like 5 healthy servers
---
Why not both?
---
Yep I have a friend who took a week off for launch and has had a hell of a time getting in much playtime.
---
Your card company will if Blizzard won't. Dispute the charge if it comes down to it. Not being able to play is a defective product. I'm going to wait it out personally, however, but if push comes to shove you do have recourse.
---
Probably doesn't help that the president of Blizzard didn't seem to want to do the project initially.
---
You need to go back to Dwarf land to get the quest.
---
Yep, Full time work, Full time school, and a baby at home. Woke up and played from 3:30am - 5:00 am this morning. No regrets:)
---
A change like that would take an insane amount of analysis and foresight. I'd like to read more about that if you can find the source.
---
It was like that in Vanilla too. You just didn't complete it and kept the rod forever. I had that quest for years.
---
Merging servers is a terrible solution.... but ok.
---
Dont think so. You could do a WeakAura telling you which one to cast and then use a macro with modifiers for the different ranks.
---
This actually happened to me but only during the first 12 hours or so after launch. I went afk for a couple hours and it just stayed logged in idk. I've played wow for years and know how it works so I was surprised. I got back on yesterday and afk'd for a while because I had to and came back to disconnected and a queue. I think it was something to do with launch issues which turned into a good thing for some people
---
I just tamed a random Lioness in The Barrens and named her Kitty. Now whenever I speak for myself, I also include Kitty. "Kitty and I are very excited for the RFC run". "I have some cloth for you, Kitty and I will be there momentarily". There is a special bond between you and your pet when you're a hunter. Especially on classic. I love how much I have to take care of Kitty. Makes me sad when she goes down in combat.
---
"I play alone and don't care if I have to start over several times," is what I read into it.
---
As much as I enjoyed WOTLK, worst thing it brought by far to me was aoe dungeons. Launch month Cataclysm brought it back, but too many people complained about the difficulty.
---
It’s been updated 4 hours ago.
---
Any launch where you have to wait hours to play is not a successful launch.
---
Ha, I knit while waiting on queues, or clean house, or read...if I could work out at the same time as queueing, life would be grand!
---
whats that for a screen? could u provide a link? loooks nice
---
You’re absolutely fine. Human is extremely good for warrior but if you aren’t pushing a hardcore guild it won’t be a big deal. People will pester your nights elf priests way more ;P
---
What for classes are not gear-dependant? Because It's the same for me.
---
If you go to a new server, you'll probably be able to pass your main character pretty quickly by not having to wait in queues.
---
It’s an RPG, play NE and make it the best day of your life.
---
My buddy started out wanting to play paladin. 3 hours later and I'm running with him from Mulgore to Durotar on his new Tauren shaman.
---
My friend got on about 8pm mountain time and it took him aprox. 1 hour
---
It won't kill retail, but I would not be shocked for a second if classic players outweighed retail players.
---
Daddy did the end of bedtime as it popped, but then had to do a quick bbq with a 25 minute timer running that wasn't for the food.
---
I have been playing classic in the mornings before class and retail in the evenings when the queues are really bad, and that’s been working out for me. I’m wondering how bad it will be this weekend

Gehennas, have been in que for 5 hours...

I came home at 5 and got to finally play around 10

Might've only got 2 hours of playtime, but it's better than nothing

In D&amp;D you can take levels in multiple classes, so it's more clear to say 7th level rogue or something like that, since you could be a level 11 character that has 7 levels in rogue and 4 levels in fighter.
---
It's just a common language way to differentiate.
---
I've lost like 5 mobs so far to 5 different mages fireblasting my target while I'm mid-charge
---
A few priests have tried to snipe a mob with SW:D but I get the hit in before it ticks, and I pretty much haven't seen any druids yet to moonfire since I'm in EK
---
I’m on firemaw too, haven’t even logged in one time, but in the same situation where friends picked this server and won’t move. I’m that fed up that I may just not play.
---
Honestly it won't hurt you that much... the main tank for the guild I raided AQ40/Naxx with in Vanilla was a Night Elf Warrior and he did incredibly well. He was actually the character who opened the AQ40 gate on Cenarion Circle for the entire server and received the scarab mount.
---
Your race in the end is not that critical, more the skill you bring.
---
This comment is for children.
---
I'd rather watch the queue than the damn baby too.
---
But you're sitting here saying your stay will be brief and what's the point etc..
---
Blizzard doesnt set the price of tokens you absolute cretin. How many times do people have to repeat the same stupid lie based on nothing but their own imagination? Scary world we live in and how easy it is to trick morons like you into believing anything.
---
I didn't think trolls could be lobsters in vanilla?
---
Do you know of one?
---
Minimal impact on actual effectiveness, major impact on how other players will judge you.
---
For some reason I heard it way clearer with "in triplicate".
---
I guess the anxiety multiple "HUH"s causes burnt into my memory more.
---
You might have a couple blues until then depending on class and spec, but as a general rule higher level gear is better.   I think I had 2-3 blues on my t2 character (wand, trinket, other little stuff).
---
No, it's more a matter of organizing friends and guilds. Many people decide on a server together and stay there to avoid confusion. 
---
I don't have server pride but I already have a guild that firmly wants to stay to avoid confusion.
---
They released the extra servers way too late, that way very few felt comfortable changing.
---
Tbh this internal discussion made me giggle.
---
I'm on a full server and lvl 25...had a perfectly smooth and fantastic Classic release. I just never quit or log back in between 3-8 am and was fortunate with d/c. I don't regrett taking off the first magic week of Classic where everyone starts from 0 a bit. On the contrary, next week lots of people will have horses alrady running around, have their first pre-raid BiS gear, are lvl 60, etc. It's not the same.
---
True?
---
My advice for professions is to look up the epics/best in slot things you COULD craft for your class (in your case, blacksmith) and then see if getting that gear is in line with your expectations as a player. If you don't think you're likely to get the mats/recipes to do much crafting, then you can focus on fun professions or farming.
---
Nice currently in queue in faerlina haha good luck
---
Awesome. When I get in I’ll try adding some of you
---
Not anymore. Classic is using the modern macro system. At least we can see tooltips now
---
If you are taking a slot on the server while you aren't playing that's a dick move whether it's in the tos or not. I do selfish things too sometimes, however I don't act like I have the moral high ground because of some technicality
---
Did you try playing with the roulette of your mouse? Forward = Attack / Back = Follow try it it's great
---
Nope, that's less than normal size.
---
Name has to be all small letters
---
Do you see me complaining about queues anywhere?
---
I went NE warrior, and I’ll tank Naxx if I want to...
---
From what I remember, you have to go to the trainer of your starting zone to do the lvl 10 quest. Be sure to at set your Hearthstone in the NE zone so at least you can use it to quickly come back after the journey.
---
People like you don’t seem to realize that the world has gotten better at games since 2004. You’re not going to be spending 30 hours in molten core because it will be easier than it was when nobody knew how to play their class and it was impossible to find 40 non-brain dead people. 
---
If you make it to 60, a lot of the grind of the game is done in 2019.
---
Thats damn expensive. No ty
---
Haha you made a comment complaining about me complaining about others complaining. GG.
---
For a generation that did some heinous shit to themselves, the previous generation and the next generation, they sure do like to play the victim.
---
No, druids can *growl,* as yes that seems nitpicky but its a huge difference for tanking. Growl forces a target to attack you and that's it. It has no effect on targets already attacking you and has no protection for DPS ripping it right back onto them.
---
Taunt forces the mob to attack the warrior for 3 seconds (so it can't be immediately pulled back) and also increases the threat you generate against it for those 3 seconds. 
---
That's why people say only warriors have taunt. Taunt is the only "taunt effect" that does anything worthwhile because it's the only one that has built in protection from DPS getting back onto the top of the threat meter immediately. 
---
Druids are also incredibly squishy in classic. They cannot be tanks outside of memeing around.
---
Oh fuck off
---
I think that’s an oversimplification. Some classes only have one viable spec, like Mages or most healers. But some have 2, like warlocks that can go either SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin. Fury warriors and protection warriors are both useful to a raid. I suspect rogues can be either dagger or sword, but I’m not very familiar with their builds. Also, there are some one-off classes that you can include, like an enhancement shaman with Nightfall axe and improved windfury totem for a melee group. Or a single shadow priest to buff warlocks, or a single boomkin to buff mages. Since all classes raid, I don’t believe you when you says “Some classes have zero”.
---
They should fight this war on 2 fronts.  
---
More layering, who cares lets just see what happens. Figure out who needs to transfer and make it happen.  
---
Make sure all AFK scripts etc get disconnected. Implement a rule where you have to get xp or whatever in a certain time slot.  
---
Thats the quick fix we all need.
---
Walking past Saurfang really brought me back.
---
As a warlock as well, I think I'm going to start trading people healthstones when they buff me! I even found a macro that auto-trades it to them! (But I haven't gotten a chance to test it yet, so I hope it works.)
---
Exactly. This guy gets it. 
---
Blizzard is adding new servers every day. If it’s more important to preserve level 12 progress than to start over in a realm you can get in, then don’t complain about the queue times. 
---
There was a time when you played the character to Lvl. 10 just to figure out if you liked the class. Now, starting over from there is supposed to be some kind of calamity? Get real.
---
Yep! That's how I feel about Grobb as well :D I'm from ED myself.
---
It's great for loading in addons
---
They should just hard reset the server every year
---
Good luck not getting banned!
---
Thank you! Will do this!
---
!RemindMe 1 month LBG17
---
This made me laugh so hard, thank you.
---
Well some people's idea of Classic+ is just BC with alterations so you are on the same page as him
---
Hit a nerve, eh?
---
Gehennas EU
---
Very low effort post - wasn't this type of content we were complaining about a week before launch
---
We are talking about occupying a space on a server for a 15 year old video game. It is near meaningless. It only means anything to about 15k people in queue and a lot of them also don’t give a fuck. I’m gonna do whatever the hell I want to do to keep my spot in the server and not feel bad about it one bit. If anything, you should be banned for making false reports and clogging up blizzards report system because you’re an angry little boy who can’t play the game. Don’t get me wrong, queues suck and it definitely shouldn’t be this way but they only suck when you’re sitting in it and not playing the game.
---
Exactly the point there is none but you take it as their is.
---
They're stealthy

What low population? Their all full...
---
I am going with the theory.
---
Wow Classic is a gym right after New year's.
---
Give it time the weak will stop coming and I can go back inside and do what I do best for the other 11.5 months.
---
&gt;but I've already seen general chats devolve into holocaust denial and "the civil war wasn't about slavery" shit fests.
---
I played from 2005 to 2012 on Shattered Hand and Stormreaver EU. And let me confirm: Classic community was always total fucking garbage. Scammers, selfish people, spammers, idiots, trolls, racists, etc, absolutely constantly. People tagging mobs and refusing to team with you. People stealing chests/ores while you are fighting mobs to get to that item. People are just too nostalgic to remember how awful it was.
---
Been playing 20 hours of classic so far. People are mostly running by silently, mob-stealing, or insulting each other. On Gehennas EU.
---
I have met a total of 3 nice people who stayed in party and quested and talked.
---
Retail and Classic are identical in this regard: The only way to find solid people is to add them to friends and join guilds together.
---
&gt;Auctionator doesn't automatically post things. It makes the process quicker and easier, but It still requires human input to post the items or buy them.
---
It requires one input, then it's automatic. No human can post 20 stacks of an item in a couple of seconds. It most certainly falls under addon behaviour that automates rather than allows accessibility/customization.
---
&gt;Using automated scripts is literally no different than botting. You're having a program play your character for you, even if it's just to hop every few seconds or cast a spell. Seeing how defensive you seem to be over this practice, I think it's safe to assume you are likely partaking in the practice aswell and should probably stop before Blizz nails you with a 6 month suspension.
---
It's funny how quickly you jumped to a definite conclusion. Of course, if I were to be botting that wouldn't actually have anything to do with this discussion, would it? 
---
Seeing how you've defended auctionator's behaviour, I think it's safe to assume you are likely using it and should probably
---
New night elf here. So I do Teldrassil, Darkshore, then head over to the harbor and do the quests in the Eastern Kingdoms?
---
With how close some pulls go when leveling solo in Vanilla, a lot of those buffs are the difference between life and death.
---
Servers have been filling up very quickly. 
---
A low pop realm today might be full tomorrow. 
---
Just be aware, everyone.
---
Blizzard constantly works to ban botters, but the botters are resilient. What they do to combat this is once blizzard finds a bug that let's them see who's botting they will sit and wait for months to log each person who does bot. Then all at once they will ban them. This means that not only is it harder to find the bug that blizzard is exploiting, it's harder to track what players were doing to get them banned, and the bot might be versions ahead as well so they cant even know when the bug was introduced. So don't worry. He'll get banned. First offense is a three day ban.
---
Eventually becomes the absolute best, by a significant margin.
---
Based on the comments people have made here, at 14 might be your best bet. There are level 16's in there and you probably won't be connecting much against them at 13 or lower.
---
Dude, if you love the idea of stomping around the world as a badass warrior of light, healing, smashing, and being generally awesome, play the paladin! I had a blast playing classic as a pally because I loved the idea and to be honest the pain points aren't as bad as everyone says they are. You're a slightly less effective warrior with the trade-off of being able to heal and giving sick buffs. It's legit fun, my dude.
---
It means left alone.
---
You need to be social to do end game content. You'll do some lfr/Lfd, maybe pug a normal raid, but you're never going to do the end game content without socializing.
---
Anyone know the highest level right now?
---
even if they do its too late now, im not spanish but i would not swap at this point unless they also offer free transfer and i dont see blizzard doing that
---
What a Trainwreck this launch has been
---
As a Druid, yes.
---
Dynamic respawn didn't arrive until ... wrath I think? It wasn't a part of vanilla so it won't be a part of classic.
---
And login queues have nothing to do with layering. Servers have a hard cap on people. There's just too many people logging in.
---
Throwing more money at it won't help, and has the potential for problems a year from now. Queues right now in exchange for healthy populations later is the best solution available.
---
FF14 had the exact same problem with the Shadowbringer launch. Some servers had 6 hour queues, character creation is STILL disabled at prime time on some servers, two months later. There were dozens of threads about people being unable to join their friends since they couldn't even create characters let alone play. My own server in that game still has 30 second queues at most hours of the day.
---
Square made the same choice Blizzard did.
---
Upvotes for VNC. Super light weight and good ui
---
No, no alterations, just BC, why do y'all feel the need to alter the game
---
There isn't enough information to make informed decisions. My worry is that sticking to a high pop high queue server will lead to bigger issues for phase 2. Let's say the queue dies down in a month...what happens when it's time to cut to 1 layer? It scares me to think it could be like this again.
---
I spend more on fast food...
---
Have a guild mate with 50+ gold already.
---
Being online and selling certain things for leveling is apparently extremely profitable.
---
Hey, OP. Some of us would like the chance to play too so if you could not. Thanks.
---
It's possible that people who were more likely to move - already did; those who are adamant on staying, stay. Less people dropping queues today.
---
I wouldn't count on it getting better within next week or two.
---
Sry what's SI:7?
---
That's what I always thought it was as well, Please Send Tell is such a weird phrase, lol

I'm an orc warlock on sulfuras. Names Dregar, made a lot of bags for people so someone out there might have my bag.

---
Paladins tank 5 mans a lot on alliance because you can hold threat with consecrate. The biggest weakness for them is no ranged pull unless you start this one quest and then never finish it (can't remember the item name).
---
Paladins also tank the scholo/strat runs that people farm endgame because of their bonuses to undead.
---
But yes, paladins cannot tank anything higher than 5 man content. Bears can't either, for what it's worth.
---
Oh man I'm with you. /leave 1 /leave 2 was the only way I could play without tearing out my hair last night
---
I'm amazed that people think a level 8 character is the reason people arent willing to jump ship and join a Panic Realm
---
The point is there's a toxic guild breaking immersion on an rp realm I thought, the other jargon from op was unneeded.
---
But no one here is going to have a suggestion that solves this problem.  The only way to solve it now is for Blizzard to offer free, flexible transfers ASAP.
---
Oddly enough all the people with time off aren’t having a problem. Only the people getting home from work. This isn’t server crashing, it’s just queues. There aren’t any during the day if you’re home playing. I haven’t waited in a queue once this week.
---
can't believe my fellow biz people play wow classic, -sip-
---
Surprise: there are no more low pop servers left
---
Annoying jump flips: check
---
Most dated meme dance: check
---
Racial ability literally makes you better at being dead: check
---
LFG (and LFR) ruined WoW, man.  I LOVE classic because people are actually looking to group to complete quests, etc.
---
My server hasn't had any queues. There was about a 20 min wait last night and I used Google Chrome Remote Desktop to login as I was leaving class. I think the afk timeout is like 30 minutes. Works like a charm.
---
It sucks though, get more servers!
---
I use both.
---
Sounds like you need to get a better job if you’re gonna bitch about 15 bucks. Maybe complaining about waiting to play a game shouldn’t be your priority right now.
---
not too bad you can face roll over everything until 20 and then you will have more tools in your kit to make things easier.
---
Not everything is a right wing boogeyman dude.
---
so are your mothers tits.
---
&gt;grown man
---
I feel you are vastly overestimating that guy
---
who cares, just play the game and have fun?
---
And people do talk with each other in game, all the time.
---
To be honest if you're unable to have a number of social interactions in a game for 9 years I think that's a problem with you, not the game.
---
Yes!
---
Thank you for this! People still at work now can get a general idea on how much time there are going to need to log in and will able to plan their evening based on it
---
&gt;Clicked a button got teleported to an instance with people I've never met and will never see again. No one said a word, we just ran through devil-may-care and killed everything without thinking about it. I got a piece of gear and then did the same thing again.
---
Maybe give the end game stuff a try next time
---
To see the class, hover over their health bar.
---
I dropped retail last september and came back for classic
---
Proof?
---
Damn 37 USD is a pretty hefty price for a guide. Now imagine buying that and you can’t even access it because your website is constantly crashing.
---
I think the answers you'll get here are going to be fairly biased.
---
No changes.
---
I created a new account for wow classic because I lost my old one. I gave retail a try, and so far there is no danger.
---
Its not as quick as everyone makes it to be (it takes ~2 hours to get to lvl 10 without heirlooms, the same amount of time a draenei/blood elf during TBC). I tried hunter priest and mage.
---
Hunter kills everything really quick while moving and priest/mage can pull 3 to 4 mobs without dying (more than that you will be dead).
---
The only time I almost died was when I pulled 4 murloc as a mage and started to frostbolt all of them at the same time, but the murloc had a really powerfull healing ability, so I had to disengage. (I was like 2 hits from dying). But I felt like I was doing reckless stuff, not that the world was dangerous
---
Yup I was also supposed to be the warrior and maintank. Also 1 of 2 GMs but feel powerless since other GM and officers are levelling at full speed never logging out  since I have only managed to be on one session due to layer crashes and ques im 20 lvls behind. Missing out on fun guildgroups on lowbie instances etc. I might just take the others in my situation and leave for another. They can stay there with their 10man guild while 40 others will have fun somewhere else.
---
YARRRRR!
---
Can’t already have a lvl 12 priest with 5h playtime
---
Check now there’s 5
---
We know what language they spoke
---
Oh no! You just went full on stick it to the people who "follow societal norms".  It's not accommodating parenthood... There are hundreds of things that could get you away from your keyboard for 10 minutes.  Don't be an idiot.
---
Yeah! The whole cast is great.  Ugh I need season 2 like now haha!
---
Possibly the most retarded take on this issue I have seen as of yet, congrats op.
---
Leshraque already back online, but not currently streaming.
---
It is my opinion, that classic wow, while not perfect. Is the best game ever made. It really is a work of art, and likely could be considered cultural for that time of gaming. 
---
I hope it sticks around, as your questions, I really hope it sticks around, maybe even add some of the content that was never finished. Food for thought for sure.
---
Cheers mate
---
Ignore them rather than trying to SJW them online. Problem solved for you.
---
Sympathy puts you in a queue. Autoclickers give you game time.
---
“Humor”
---
Nice. So basically you are searching for the color of a single pixel?
---
It is literally pay to win. Real world money for in game advantage.
---
Mage and Warrior are the top two most populated classes by far. Both contend for gear but most of the warriors problem is if they go dps they are always beind the tank for gear prio and they roll against rogues for leather and weapons frequently. Mages get early priority for gear since they out dps locks pretty badly early before ZG. If you love mage play mage.
---
Europoors aren't playing Vanilla, they all quit after the privates went down. Literally priced out.
---
Even firemaw had zero que at 8am today, but 3 hours later you're faced with a 10k que that takes literal 10 hours.
---
I know because I logged in at 11am and i'm still here now, 8 hours later with 1.6k to go, and it's super slow to move atm.
---
How much did you pay extra for that black stripes?
---
If you go Dwarf then you will have more bargaining power because they will need fear ward and will have to let you be shadow. 
---
I agree with u/skwiddcs that it isn't uncommon to take one, but they definitely are more niche, as it was mostly a leveling talent tree until TBC.
---
I cooked dinner last night and just kept shaking my character awake.  I ain't sitting in a 12 hour queue just because I have to follow biological functions.
---
He's an Onion!
---
&gt;where should I Play
---
Not WoW. Blizzard is just spitting in our faces with this launch and deserve a class action lawsuit for a refund of all subs that where made for the name reservation.
---
Sidegrade question from what should I play, *where* should I play; I'm halfway through level 17 but didn't realize Darkshore is apparently a great zone and where I should've went instead of Loch Modan. I also want Nelf Rep but I assume the first dozen or so quests I get at Darkshore will be gray by two or three levels. Is it still worth doing that zone or should I just wait until Ashenvale?
---
*Chuck Norris jokes intensify*
---
Then I can never play and I pay for it. Got off that high horse and see facts. When I get home I queue and can't get in before bed. That doesn't make sense so I will idle so I can play the game I pay for.
---
Any of the mediums are still a solid choice.
---
I was in queue for about 2 hours when I noticed a streamer was alt-tabbing between retail and classic, so I decided to play some retail while I waited. Ya, I was disconnected and sent back to the beginning of the line.
---
He must have had two accounts :'-(
---
Blizzard are listening very closely to what the classic community say about the next steps, go support the idea of r/classicwowplus
---
Couldn't tell you because I think most PvP servers are horde favored. I'm on Kirtonos Horde which doesn't have a census for. But I'd pick a new server if you wanted to find some balance.
---
In Firemaw we don't have this problem, right know the estimated queue time is 15 hours, so you can go to bed and be sure that when you come back to your PC you will still be in the Queue.
---
I'm about 12.5 right now on that server. You forsaken? Where you questing?
---
Am I taking crazy pills?
---
What's stopping someone from making an afk script that requires a human input? ie. what I've talked about before.
---
You automate an action that's started by the human and you avoid the afk-dc.
---
Before I get accused of botting again, I'm looking at this from the perspective of blizzard. They have the problem of differentiating between people using addons that are widely used and supposedly perfectly legitimate, and behaviour which is a big no no.
---
How do they do this? Some people keep saying they can just ban on a whim, but that doesn't work if you don't want to ban someone who's not actually an offender. So what do you do? You do it from a technical viewpoint.
---
Unless Auctionator uses some kind of AH-only code to do its thing, it's no different to things like ClassicLFG, and other scripts that automate behaviour and are a bad thing in blizzard's Classic playbook.
---
Oh, and to be extra scummy. Let's say blizzard CAN differentiate between people using auctionator(a widely used and nice addon), and afk-scripters. What happens when an afk-scripter uses the auctionator to avoid getting afk-dc'd?
---
Both days have been a 5-6 hour wait so far if you log in after 3pm
---
All the blue posts tell us is the classic wow team doesn't have a clue what they are doing.
---
They are failing at this launch big time.
---
Uhh, priests are waaaay faster than paladin at leveling, specially if you keep your wand up to date.
---
For example, at level 13 I got a greater wand, 17dps. I just dot, bubble, wand, maybe a mind blast. I don't stop to drink ever. The wand is hitting as hard as my spells.
---
I think the whole idea of racing to 60 almost negates what classic brings back.   
---
Adventure.   
---
What I truly believe ruined the modern game (amongst many other things) was the introduction of speed running. Ever since it became normal to race through everything without paying any attention; the whole "Immersive" world thing slowly faded away.  
---
TLDR; I'm fishing too bro.
---
What is the purpose of the macro? Do you even know what it’s supposed to do other than “QoL macro”?
---
Lol nowhere is safe for queues.
---
Revised my earlier argument:
---
~~Blizzard has likely not been a giant revenue stream/active user base compared to others of Activision's ventures, at least not 'per game' (Not counting all games blizzard has released combined).~~ Reformed argument because I'm stupid and didn't consider OW/HOTS/Hearthstone microtransactions. Instead: Vanilla isn't close to a similar revenue stream to these games since the only cost is subscription. Less revenue stream projected = less resources provided.
---
Oh it's still cool! It's similar to getting under Org. Pretty neat place.
---
I think the most common way under Stormwind is via the crate&gt;torch&gt;ledge&gt;corner at one of the passage/archways.
---
Had to upvote that response, it made me legit laugh because I read it in his voice.
---
IIRC, the TOS says something that a person has to be actively behind the keyboard. If a GM comes to verify that they’re really there, and they’re not, they’ll get banned. Something like this is pretty easy to detect because they will be jumping at pretty much the same interval each time.
---
&gt; I don't care about your dumb to spend even a nanosecond to think about it. Just outright say it if you want to argue properly.
---
You said WoW Classic retaining launch numbers would be unprecedented.
---
WoW Classic is a reboot of WoW.
---
WoW at launch grew in orders of magnitude by its first 18 months.
---
You said this game's population being retained after launch would be unprecedented, when in fact this exact game not only retained its launch numbers but multiplied them 10+ times.
---
I got my first grey shoulder item last night. I feel ya! 
---
I’ve also been in that guys shoes. Try selling something, get no response or people trolling, and end up finding that one guy that genuinely needs it. By then I just wanna do something nice to the one guy bein cool lol.
---
Angry much?

does he wait in the queue 6+ hours?
---
Ive had a good time thus far on both rp pvp realms. I know Deviate Delight is the East coast server so maybe go that if it benefits you. Grobbulus I cant speak for alliance side as I rolled horde, but both servers have been very populated and friendly.
---
HAIL!
---
ElvUI, ElvUI AddonSkins (most of them don't work, I have this for the embed settings), Details!, ClassicCodex, AdvancedInterfaceOptions or w/e it's called, Extended Quest Log (or w/e it's called...it's basically EQL3).
---
Tonight I'm going to get an auction addon going.
---
I thought it was "Willing to Buy/Sell" for 15 years, fucking kill me.
---
boars have charge in vanilla right? preety sure thats the most op spell
---
Dailies are amazing,  not how they were in BC but how they are now. Flying made sense and was needed for BC...
---
Can someone make the same for Priests with PW:F please? :)
---
I'd like to see them roll out TBC classic servers, or release some new content within the current classic servers once we've cleared all the raids.
---
Guild bank please.
---
8659 -&gt; 367 min , sudden drop to 6584 -&gt; 30 min, goes up to 9504 -&gt; 400 min. 
---
[What?](https://imgur.com/a/hdDvsU6)
---
They go away in game....just the loading and the character screen
---
&gt; Loot means something again.
---
Seeing classic loot again made me realize how fucking boring and homogenized items (and stats!) are on retail. In retail basically every item you get is identical: Stam, Your Primary Stat, Two Secondary Stats. If you get multiple different pieces of the same type at the same ilvl, the stats are basically identical. And your primary stat is just a very bland, flat damage increase
---
In classic each of the primary stats can be relevant to many classes and roles because they’re more indirect boosts to your performance. And items are wild but I love it, like I had Agility Intellect gloves. But you aren’t guaranteed Stamina, sometimes you specifically want Stamina-only items for the health boost. 
---
Just so much more meaningful and interesting
---
Dynamic Respawn is a part of Classic, have you not noticed? 
---
Here's a source: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dynamic-respawns/245750/71
---
And Square Enix is likely another story. Are they backed by a giant like Activision? No. Shadowbringers is iirc the highest ranked MMO/MMO Expansion on MetaCritic ever, even if they could've known they made a giant hit, without financial backing they can't mitigate it. The revenue from Shadowbringers and new subs takes time to turn into resources. 
---
Activision would have the possibility to provide these resources for WoW Classic already. 
---
Throwing money at a problem in relation to a game can be a solution, depending on what the money is being used towards. More resources/Possibily more staff from the start to work on a scaling solution (as in, more resources), would certainly help, unless there's technical limitations due to the coding they build classic wow on, which I do not know.
---
You could try asking a Hunter to use their "Track Humanoid" ability
---
Yeah you’ll get your account instantly banned, go ahead.
---
So... What zone? EU/NA ?
---
As of now on EU all servers are with a huge queue.
---
I'll be getting home at 1:45 though lol
---
Been stuck at position 200 for 1,5h
---
r/classicwowplus :) x
---
About the bat question: Yes they are good, but the only way to obtain the SCREECH spell is to tame a Greater Fleshripper (Carrion bird, level 16-17, Westfall), or a level 30+ vulture from Thousand Needles. There are more options later levels.
---
Can't when I can't play at all that day due to blizzard failing to launch a game with proper server levels
---
Yeah. The red button in the middle is solid color until it becomes the color of Night Elf.
---
And it feels awesome ! Because that professions actually useful and takes effort to level in this version of the game. My guild send two of our tailors a ton of linen, which has meant their behind with money, but even the guildies that can barely play (fuck this incompetent launch) have 4 bags waiting in their mailbox! Classic makes ppl want to help each other.
---
The best way to kill hype? Fucking chaotic launches. 
---
You are pulling a bunch of numbers out of your arse to try and justify the shit show, that has been known about since name reservations. 
---
If servers are full just on naming characters you have a problem.
---
Staying positive. I like it.
---
Mmmm in FL, juniorship was 45k, second job after 2 years was 85k. Now making a good amount more. The money is there if you're good at it.
---
That’s the exact way we did it
---
HUH... HUH.............. HUH HUH HUH
---
OH SHIT! RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN YOU FOOLS!!
---
My G7 with similar specs just came in and I noticed the heat coming from the game with settings over 7. Will give this a go, god bless!
---
YOU GIVE THAT BABY SOME PETS AND SCRITCHES RIGHT NOW
---
Spend the 5 points in Disc for wand specialization, get a good wand, no more mana problems. I usually PW:S&gt;Mindblast/Smite (Whatever hits harder at the time) &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand to death
---

I made a character on Old Blanchy and basically got right in.
---
Do it. Worth it.
---
This is how i'm level 24 rogue already...
---
But now I am back to work, my one day NEET lifestyle has ended =(
---
Remote desktop is your friend. I queue up about an hour before I leave work.
---
boi. classic is just out for a day. wait a bit before you judge.
---
One hell of a lisp
---
Modifiers refer to ctrl, shift, and alt.
---
I'm sure people would have played a free beta rather than pay to sit in queues for 8 hours.
---
Can't have too little servers for obvious reasons and they can't have too many in case a rapid decline of players just disappear because of data collection. They see numbers and when they reach a certain peak they then analyze that in decide if they need more servers or not.
---
If you think it'll help, go for it.
---
So now I’m level 20 on my 4th choice of server with no friends and I don’t want to start over.  I’m worried about being on a second class server.  I really hope they add a transfer service some time before raiding begins.
---
They estimated about 500k users but got over 2 million. You can’t estimate that.
---
Blizzard let me and my 4 friends move our level 12 characters to a new realm because we are too timid to have a real conversation with each other about moving to avoid queue times.
---
Tfw you have friends that play.
---
Not solving this issue will cause massive level inequality.
---
fuck you zoomer
---
You  check what the pixel color is on where your cursor is and when it changes it alerts you?
---
I've been ninja inviting people close to me into groups that are obviously on the same quest or waiting for the same kill. 100% of invites have been approved, welcomed and thanked!
---
How are you feeling about that server? Most peoples worry would be that they'll be the first to dwindle and die if it all tapers off in a few weeks or months.
---
This looks like a job for me!
---
And what if that value is the same?  Standing in the same spot for 15 minutes does not mean you are botting.  It's not illegal to stand in the same spot.
---
Again, it also doesn't work if the person is pressing the up or down or either strafe key.  Their x,y will be different and then it goes back to being, "undetected."
---
Can go a lot earlier with Teron Gorefiend
---
Planning on playing a druid. I want to level feral, and probably do some tanking along the way. Anyone know a good hybrid spec for this? Thanks!
---
The future is bleak.  Not due to lack of interest from the playerbase but due to the blizzard team in charge of classic being clueless and retarded
---
Yet somehow streamers are hitting lvl 40 already. Fuck this. Blizzard does not deserve this franchise.
---
1.5 hour to go from 320 to 304 in the que what a joke
---
I personally, have no problem with account perma-bans for gold selling.
---
"But my account was hacked"
---
Boo-fucking-hoo. Expensive lesson for you.
---
It's not even weekend!
---
The problem is that prime raiding times on the popular servers are potentially going to have insane queues if enough of the playerbase stays. Sure, it might be fine leveling the rest of the way, but what about when you need to log on at 8:30 on a Tuesday night to raid?
---
I buffed Fort ona warlock this morning and they followed me and opened a trade window, and gave me a Healthstone, I thought that was cool coz it did save my ass later on!
---
I did the same thing. Feel for you buddy. I sold it back for \~ 12s. prob shoulda just saved it for later.
---
The lines were the minority. Most of the quest movs had a mob of people around them spamming their instants.
---
I think 4 days 20 hours 1 to 60 is pretty damn fast. Joana has been first to 60 on classic servers several times.
---
Yeah, but people don't pay attention and then keep on with stupid shit like that.
---
I think the only time the grace period isn't there is when it's a legit server crash. It might wipe it's cache.
---
To be fair, it might be until Christmas when you get through the queue next.
---
Let me tell you the competition I experience...
---
Yesterday, ETA 13:30:00 GMT, Location: Barrens, The Forgotten Pools.  
---
We were 15 people trying to get some Mushrooms from around the pools... 
---
Spawn time: Incredibly shitty...
---
Now I wrestle with half of the continent in Queue... The competition is real.
---
That 15 hours of playtime will come even faster if YOUR GROUP OF "FRIENDS" choose a server that does not have 25 hours of queue time. Think about it.
---
Check the AMA, maybe you missed it. The Classic team is considering server transfers in a later phase because it was in Vanilla, and is part of the "Classic motto". But, they want the game (and it's said multiple times in there) to be community based. You can't build a community if you are immediately offering free character transfers. 
---
Despite that this subbreddit has you thinking, not every server has a queue of 10K+ -- are queues on most servers? Absolutely, but, not every single one is a 4+ hour wait.
---
Get fucked
---
They didnt have enough servers so a lot of people can't play due to long que times.
---
After they launched the game they kept adding new realms but they quickly filled up and have long que times.
---
Many of us picked a server with a guild prior to launch and picked servers blizzard recommended to avoid long que times.  These servers still have 6+ hour que times every afternoon
---
If you get through the queue and are on the character select screen, does it now time you out after 30 minutes or no?
---
Yep an absolute insult to the face of a face and many others by extension. No apology given. I love this game but I hate this company as it is now and its public faces.
---
I am really not. THe problem is Blizzard don't hate the player hate the game and that works here.
---
Thanks for this. I’ll set it up tonight.
---
If your going to dedicate time to it, warrior with gear is a monster.  Shamen is very reliant on good rng, but I love it.  Makes for great montage videos.  You also can't go wrong with a lock.  Play what you find fun.
---
am i only one who thinks its ridiculous to pay for a guide period even if its $1?
---
[https://prnt.sc/oyrgi8](https://prnt.sc/oyrgi8)
---
 was it?
---
But un'goro's right next to it and that place is awesome!
---
Lonk i'm on my way!
---
Did you miss that i specifically wrote "classic+" and not just "Classic"?
---
Yesterday I saw someone in alliance doing the same thing. Multi boxing. Had at least 10-15 people following him.
---
Like I've said, that doesn't solve the living door problem.
---
Some people could legitimately perform that kind of behaviour and you'd ban innocents. There's definitely not a lot of people that would impact, but it's enough for blizzard to care.
---
It's not a clean solution.
---
Or C - it was B.
---
Well, it was Xavius mocking him, so it was pathetic on purpose.
---
I do the "drive by" buffs.
---
Yeah a little bit,but you have to understand them.Once you log off its over,there is no going back anytime soon.
---
just got better - 95 minutes yey
---
Pay for a service and be treated poorly and denied the service will do that to you.
---
Computer is used exclusively for WoW Classic, didn't have it beforehand. 
---
All the good secrets are on my phone 🤫
---
How do you like Priests vs. Shamans in group PVE/Leveling? I want to be a healer for my group, but I also want to have fun doing it. 
---
I think Shaman would be cool cuz I could actually whack things and crit and all that + use totems. But Priests just seem a bit boring w/ just spamming wand. Do I have that right?
---
I pay I should be able to play and waiting in a q of 21000 people is ludicrous.
---
No. Don't worry about it.
---
Attack speeds are not normalized in this patch. Fast pets do exist in the world but Brokentooth is mine.
---
Can you people stop? OH BOO HOO, I'M PLAYING ON A FULL SERVER AND EXPERIENCE QUEUES THE FIRST WEEK.
---
Names are important to many, so is the local community. I would much rather have queues in the beginning than server merges.
---
The addon API does not allow for automation of player inputs, period. That is what I'm trying to tell you
---
Yeah she loves it
---
WHOOSH!
---
People need to just move servers guys. They gave us a ROUGH soft cap on the servers of 10k. You EVER log into your server and see a 20k que... odds are you need to find another server.... Wanting them to throw up versions of a server to people can get together later is one concept, but imo, they will just let a few new servers come out each day until the giant influx slows down.  
---
Complaining about Que times is a bit silly. Go find another server to play on. Yeah, it sucks, but there is a reason I had everyone we are playing with wait till day of. We wanted to avoid the absurdly over populated servers.
---
He just crazy waitin in the que
---
Yes I 100% agree I think they should do a Classic+ and keep the classic server they implemented for the ones that want to stay, but let you copy over your character so you don't HAVE to start over again. But Just have classic with added content, no changes to talents or spells or updated QoL. Same Classic WoW with just new Raids/Areas/Mounts that make sense. I think it could be good for the community.
---
Don’t bother reasoning with this guy.
---
Happy cake day
---
Mine did the same for me. The queue finished before I got home so I had her make a character and play so I wouldn't time out.  She doesn't like the game and was just watching tv with her laptop at my desk and tapping space bar every few minutes.
---
Maybe I'm in a low population layer but Deviate Delight last night felt pretty barren. I'd only see another player in Loch Modan and Darkshore out and about questing every 10-20 minutes. It's absolutely the top on my list of most likely to die later and need to be rolled into Grobbulus or something.
---
On the other hand I get to actually play the game so there's that.
---
Logged in fine at 10am Pacific Standard Time
---
That has to be fixable. I think everyone, even the most dedicated of fans, knows that there's an enormous surge at the start that will slowly whittle down. I think Classic will be huge, but obviously nowhere near as huge as it is right now this week.
---
But it's pretty ridiculous for Blizzard to just keep server caps when there are people waiting 8+ hours to get into the game. 
---
I know nothing about tech so maybe I'm coming off like a moron here, but given how cloud-ized everything is these days, I have a hard time believing they couldn't rejigger some priorities and allow the caps to temporarily raise on the servers so that people can play, knowing that they will die down in a month or so.
---
Well stop aiming for the liver.
---
Play whatever you want lol, just don’t get mad when I kite you into oblivion with frost shock ;)
---
Everyone who is being salty just doesn’t know how to avoid queues lol.
---
The estimated timing is likely just counting how many people are leaving the queue over a certain period. Then dividing your position in the queue by the number of people who left.
---
For example, say you're at position 1,000 in the queue. Over the next 30 seconds 100 people leave the queue. They either abandoned the queue, logged in or got disconnected.
---
1,000 / 100 x 30s = 300s. It will take the queue 300s (5 minutes) to empty at that rate. Cool you say.
---
But then in the next 30 seconds only 10 people leave. Well now the calculation is :
---
900 / 10 x 30s = 2,700 seconds = 45 minutes.
---
Darn. 
---
tl;dr - People leave the queue at inconsistent rates, leading to inconsistent time estimates.
---
Muglore including its chat was all nice people and chill vibes, with everycow helping each other and taking turns.  
---
Then came Barrens.
---
Ive been in 3 lines and formed 1 of those myself on Grob horde.
---
I never would have thought of that!
---
Still have a couple days off, but I slept in till 9am and now there's a 9300 person queue.  Uh oh.
---
I gave up on that. Went to a low population server to play. Found cool people to play with. My buddies i used to play with are able to get in and play while im at work, by the time i get home the queue is like 300+ minutes. The new server has no queue time right now and ive already found a guild with cool people to play with. Maybe in a few months ill consider switching but at this point who knows. I can only play during primetime and im not really a hardcore gamer anymore so logging in, getting a few quests in, maybe try a dungeon. Thats all. Not hours of waiting to get like 3 quests dkne
---
Stephen Hawkins in the bottom right corner?
---
Not seeing the lines like in all of those posts, but if an area is over-camped, I just start healing and assisting others to get their stuff done faster. 
---
This has two results; 
---
- it helps thin the crowding so you can get your kills in without interference
---
-people you help repeatedly often reciprocate by either tossing an invite or just help you murder things you tap.
---
Maybe Myzrael is super Carebear, but that has been my experience at far. Just remember to emote at them and shit, it usually gets folks attention.
---
I'm pretty happy a friend of mine is jumping way ahead in levels. It just means he can bear tank run me through RFC and WC when I get to those levels :p
---
I have just disconnected after waiting six hours to join a queue a was still about two hours to join in.
---
I came back right in th ebegining of the queue. I think for today and will try again early tomorrow.
---
It wa expected to be that crowded but it seems it will be like that for another week until it stabilise. (to bad I only planed to play classic for a month)
---
Good for the rep and weapon specs. Though, dwarf is pretty tempting for stone form.
---
&gt; Except what you're describing is basically why there's layering.
---
No, it's not the same. Layering exists to overload a server with the expectation population will die down.
---
Extra realms with a shared name pool does the same thing, but it also provides a realm for people to continue to play on if the server doesn't die down -&gt; So they don't have to be afraid of opening too many.
---
banana peel on the desk guy
---
I spent about 11 hours in que so far and have played a total of zero seconds.
---
Those of us who cant log on early in the day are not able to play due to the incompetence at blizzard.
---
OG Monks lol
---
The difference is layering is consistent. The only downside is existing friends might be on a different layer but you can just group up on bnet (And layer hopping has a CD so use it wisely!).
---
Sharding meanwhile pingpongs you back and forth every few feet I swear.
---
I was worried going in. I was excited but I was worried it’s been too long, and people would be too used to retail and current gaming that we wouldn’t be able to have these experiences again. That people would just stick to themselves. But 2 minutes in, unable to tag kobold vermin’s people started grouping, and even though it took me 30 minutes to get that first quest done it was the most fun I’ve had playing WoW since Cata at least, probably wotlk. I’m taking my time, only level 12 now and I’ve enjoyed every second and the people I’ve already met,
---
Looks like a multiboxxer
---
I am trying to find the best skills to use as a priest.  
---
I heard enchanting was good for the wand.  Tailoring maybe?  Bags and for the wand thing?  
---
Secondary will be making cash but I'm not focused on that until later in game as long as I am leveling fine.
---
Blizzard banned my guild name in 2005 because it had alternating caps and misspelled words. They literally invented a term to justify it, they said "We don't not allow Dudespeak".
---
Blizzard has no problem banning things
---
Brutal, unrelenting grind please, EQ style
---
There's a reason why WoW is the most successful game of all time
---
The difference is auctionator is an add-on within blizzard api that they control. If they don't like it they will remove the functionally. External applications that automate in any way are flat out forbidden.
---
Take my haaannd, and follow us into Warcraft, so far that we can’t get back.
---
Most of the stress test were done during the day or night for Europe. Only one was made during a week end. It was impossible to test when you have a job
---
Priest will be a much faster and easier leveling experience.  They are both great healers in end game.  Go priest.
---
How would i level? Spec right into resto and quest and do dungeons?
---
Agreed but most people are dumb and will get mad! Might as well please the tank so you don't get booted or yelled at. I'm sure there are some tanks that understand and will let the Hunter know that auto growl is ok
---
That isn't possible as an adult with a full time job. I queue as soon as I can and cannot play at all that day.
---
No, that's incorrect, look at what Blizzard said. Layers only exist to prevent overcrowding of starting zones. In phase two, players will be much more spread out so layering won't be needed anymore. The pop limit will stay the same.
---
100% will never respect the line for a mob.
---
Capitalism doesn't care about reasons.
---
I'm going to get my tiny violin out for your nonexistent living door.
---
Title should read: You think you do, but you can’t get in.
---
&gt;I'm not a pilot, but if I see a helicopter in a tree I can confidently say someone fucked up.
---
I dunno man I've seem some weeeeeird art pieces in my day.
---
If there's an inn, the mailbox is in front of it.
---
Seriously dont get tricked into picking a recommended realm. They are usually the first to die when the hype is over.
---
Focuses hard on classic? Yeah man, those two updates they have planned for it that were designed and created 15 years ago will sure require a lot of resources to implement.
---
Someone is probably already 60
---
But it allows for automation of player INITIATED player inputs?
---
How else would auctioneers/auctionator's functionality work? 
---
Is it really that hard for an afk scripter to make the script require a player input?
---
I have no time constraints at the moment but I still ain't gonna get up at 6am to play WoW. I might have done it in 2006/7 but not now. I guess it'll just be a waiting game, because I don't think they're going to do much except wait for the initial explosion of interest to die down. Do they have a maintenance twitter or PR account for Classic? I haven't seen them address much of these issues.
---
Blizzard: That sounds like a dedicated guild!
---
It’s called multi boxing and it’s allowed by blizzard. It sucks but it’s not botting
---
Me and and a random guy did quests all day. It was so much fun.
---
Haha!!! This could be the lyric man, fits perfectly!
---
Stop spreading this info
---
"that works here"
---
What does that even mean? You're being selfish. End of story.
---
Keep it secret!
---
Is that a 35 character multiboxer. What in the fuck?
---
Does anyone know what the faction ratio is on Ashbringer EU? Are there any large foreign language communities there right now? It's a full server but only has a \~60m queue which seems reasonable.
---
It's a multi boxer. One person controlling multiple accounts. Not a bot.
---
100% OP. Classic really exposed how bad retail really is, and has been since WotLK. Classic brings back the "world" feeling, sense of community and, most importantly, sense of accomplishment. Retail is literally a watered down mess which focuses solely on streamlining and absolutely ruined what made it great in the first place. I hope Blizzard learns from this...
---
But have you tested your luck on bear hearts in silverpine?
---
Tell that to Tauren and the elevator doors.
---
I’m so fucking depressed right now. Been with my guild for over 4 months now and here I am considering dropping my subscription because of this stupid ducking clusterfuck that blizzard is 100% responsible for. 
---
Seriously WHY THE FUCK ARE WE HAVING 12 HOUR LONG QUEUES 
---
YOU FUCKS KNEW HOW MANY WERE COMING
---
YET YOU ONLY MADE 3 FUCKING STARTING SERVERS?!
---
Fuck I’m livid. Dropping my sub and not looking back at this horseshit. Blizzard has officially lost me as a customer.
---
It's halloumi burgers. But yhea, sort of a sandwich if you think about it. :)
---
They named a reindeer after him. What more do you want? ;P
---
Yes you are.
---
My tears will be fueled by my respect and being proud if you. Like a father looking at his son.
---
Honestly great; it's lively and stupid and everything it needs to be. I've had a blast going through the Barrens so far.
---
My favorites are TBC, followed by Wrath and Vanilla. Those are the only three expansions worth the time and money in my opinion.
---
Are you in a raid?
---
Don't you mean *WHERE TO PLAY?*
---
*WHAT REALM?! CHOOSE WISELY!*
---
Mirage raceway does have a queue but only a few minutes. I'm on Nethergarde Keep which is medium with no queue and plenty of players.
---
Jesus Christ you’re right. The literal Nigerian god.
---
Shhh, you'll upset the retail casuals
---
Correct.
---
They needed more then 15 servers when name selection dropped. The way I looked at it I feel like we got jerbaited to pay $15 to reserve names that we can’t even use because those servers are impossible to get in.
---
Thanks for the info. Not sure why I got down voted.
---
I heard him earlier say that people should play how they want. He was talking about slow vs speed levelers.
---
Thalnos was pretty much a language war between English and Portuguese speakers, so my friends and I decided we're going to switch to another server. Whole day of progress down the drain but oh well
---
But you can clear tough mobs faster with less downtime in a group.
---
brilliant
---
The only Wow killer was Wow itself
---
Thanks I was thinking of mining aswell. But what about the kind of pvp where I go solo(as horde) into alliance territory and try to find solo pickoffs just to fuck with them... still engineerings?
---
Is efficiency all that matters when socializing?
---
Why do we all of a sudden consider 16 hours an enormous hurdle when every person here could probably /played an old vanilla character and measure the time in years?
---
Now I’m crying in class. Thanks dad
---
Is this a major problem on Firemaw? People standing around moving ½ yard every 15 minutes?
---
What was your race/class? Can't understand what ppl is complaining about.
---
Ahhhh druids were the worst unless you had two rogues on them stun locking and kicking them to death.
---
found the rs3 pker
---
Doing good there. I spammed my Stam buff until I was oom on one mage who didn't get the point last night, so thank you for helping us casters out!
---
"best" is subjective. Regardless of guide or dungeon spamming, speed running Classic is only going to end in disappointment for people who do so and find out Classic endgame isn't the best part of the game. Also, Unless you do speed runs for the sake of speedrunning, getting to endgame and discovering there aren't enough people to put a 40 man together yet is going to be interesting to see.
---
Players have more opportunity to be social in classic out if necessity but a game won't make an antisocial person more social.
---
Just whisper some random person you see doing the same thing as you and see what happens
---
XP nerf? lol. And yes, it is. I’ve been in more random groups for quest than I have been in BFA so far. And people are talking again in those small groups.
---
enchanting is fine but its not a money maker at all. You can just buy the wand off another enchanter or auction house. Tailoring can net you some money with bags (a couple silver each so you won't get rich of them) and other BOE blue tailor items that you can sell or use later on.
---
Many people are taking skinning for sure at this point because it's quick and easy gold (sell the skins to vendor). There are no best professions.

So far, I have a Tauren warrior and a troll priest. I plan on leveling the warrior with some IRL friends, and leveling the priest when solo. I’m considering making a third character (yes, I am an alt-oholic) but I am unsure what to go with. Any suggestions? This character will mostly be a banker, but I plan on eventually leveling it up, possibly for pvp once the battlegrounds are available.
---
Queues on just about every server last night (except for ones set up yesterday).
---
What you do is wake your "adult" ass up early and play then instead of crying about how there's a queue when you get off of work.
---
So, like the first comment, I'd have to put in maximum effort for it. But it'd still fall behind warrior?
---
Not being sarcastic you can eliminate the 2 screens with just 1 more monitor.
---
12, but this is my level 1 bank alt putting in work.
---
You are a idiot.   
---
Do you know how long it takes to do MC and the other raids?
---
Is it worth saving $30 for you (cost for realm transfer if blizz doesn't do it for free) to sit in queues for 2 weeks and waste hours of time? 
---
I've given up on stalagg and I'm currently rolling on benediction, I'll pay the $30 (potentially) just to not have to deal with queues.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Dungeons and certain quests require groups.  Last night I grouped up with a random dude in the same area as me so we could fight our way to the back of a mine to kill a quest boss.  We had a nice time and disbanded after that. It would have sucked to attempted solo.
---
Being social doesn't necessarily mean leveling together.
---
I made it to level 12(left at level 4 after getting xonj water) before going back to IF for more spells as a mage because I wanted that sweet Darn rep. It was painful, but I'm sure I'll thank myself down the road when buying my cat mount.
---
Not a chance, haha
---
And just in case you are wondering, I have figured this out for a fact through experience with Guildies
---
wont matter when you can just remote desktop and do the same thing. Im not losing my spot on the server
---
In 4 hours of play, I have already created adhoc parties for questing more than I ever did in the entirety of BFA. Honestly, there is a much higher level of cooperation because things can be more challenging. It’s so far been a breath of fresh air.
---
Its been an hour lol, go for a walk, go buy groceries, come back to the enter world button =)
---
The key is to go to bed really early, like 9-9:30pm, because that's primetime and when servers are ridiculously crowded and laggy, but then you can get up at like 5am when there's zero queue and get a lot done.
---
I noticed your username. I don't appreciate philanderers trying to spread libel. You disgust me.
---
While I agree with your points generally, I will say anecdotally the past two days I have run into familiar names already. Just people I happened to log in with at about the same time and have been progressing relatively similarly. Haven't added any new bnet friends yet, but got a whisper from someone last night I had grouped with Monday for some help. So far it's been major hubs and cities where layering and such really distance me from familiar names.
---
“You get an arcane intelligence, you get an arcane intelligence...”
---
That might be the issue. I think i have it set to defensive. I will have to check when i get home. Thanks!
---
People actually talk in groups now! It’s amazing! It feels like I’m actually playing with human beings. And so far they’ve all been super nice too! Everyone just seems to be having a good ol time.
---
&gt; Blizzard is expecting MASSIVE drop offs in the coming days/weeks
---
Yea, that's gonna be self fulflling since people are gonna give up on trying to play with 8 hr queues after work.
---
just click ten storms server 4head
---
Majority of your XP gain doesn't come from mob grinding, it comes from finishing quests as fast as you can. So grouping is definitely not discouraged.
---
How so? It's your bread and butter spell as a frost mage (except certain level ranges) and the cast time reduction is most effective at lower levels.
---
This is more of a "WHERE I should play" question:
---
I started leveling on Deviate Delight RP-PVP, but the population is always low or medium at best, with no queue ever. Meanwhile Grobbulus seems to be always high and busy. It feels like DD will be less exciting with more people who "just rolled cause it was open" as I'm seeing in Elwynn general chat.
---
Any opinions? I'm not too far on DD that I can't just reroll on one of my reserved Grobb names... even if I'll have to deal with night queue.
---
Why would Classic WoW being launched for the first time in 15 years die down? Idk.. common sense? Why isn't WoW at 1.1million viewers right now like it was Monday?

---
You using an app on your phone for Remote Desktop?
---
Imagine being so triggered you accuse others of being triggered.
---
Your question was which class is *more bursty* not "do warlocks have burst potential?". Mages are more bursty than warlocks at every stage of the game and by a wide margin. If you are wanting to roll warlock and just concerned about having some burst potential, you can rest easy.
---
I've been doing this every day since Classic Launch , otherwise I'd never get to play with my friends on the server they picked. I'd be glad to move realms, and so would they if Blizz offered free character transfers. Since we already have a number of hours in on our characters now none of us want to start them up again, but a free transfer would mitigate that.  For those that are angry at people doing this, well you all have phones right? Install a remote connection app on there (like teamviewer) and you can do the same even if you don't have a job with easy access to PC's or if your job blocks remote apps on the corporate network.
---
Probably too busy snorting coke and human trafficking.
---
So, you're autistically screeching about blizzard when your group was too impatient and communicates poorly?  That's a hard life to live.
---
"me and a bunch of friends", are you in a raid / have more than 4 friends with you?   
---
fix: leave raid group
---
otherwise might be server issues
---
alternately: super bad luck /low chance drops
---
Wrong. Population limit in phase 2 will be equal to what it was in vanilla. Right now every layer has the population of one vanilla server, which means the population is many times higher than in vanilla. In phase 2, each server's population cap will equal one layer.
---
Had to skip to the end of this comment to make sure it wasn't a shittymorph.
---
Imenno, blyt'
---
use a remote desktop app (team viewer) and just hit space bar on your phone every so often.
---
This is because in later expansions like bfa creature damage is connected to their level so a level 11 boar hits approximately as much as a level 11 Defias.
---
In classic the numbers are abstract. The level 11 Defias has X damage and the level 11 boar has Y damage. This was not the case on private servers as they missed the data to set these numbers.
---
I don't personally but I don't have to
---
You should have thought out and aligned your life priorities beforehand.
---
Nope.  Dating back to vanilla the first thing I did on every new character is /leave 1, 2 and 3.
---
but shifting costs a lot of mana
---
Remote desktop=love.
---
I'm still on retail waiting for the ques to die down, not gonna lie.
---
Yes, but the Chinese servers really boosted counts in WotLK. I suspect the NA decline had started already by then.
---
Someone needs leatrix.
---
For PvE dwarf priest is most sought after due to fear ward, if I recall
---
Thanks for drawing sex.
---
Destro. Nightfall + Conflag + Shadowburn = Big Bomba
---
Play BFA if you want that.
---
How does it make sense?
---
“Bro just reroll bro so what if you have to do it 4 times because all the new servers get queues too bro”
---
Some people work or have kids or other things which means they can only play a few hours a night meaning A) 5 hour waits to play are even worse for them and B) They don't have the luxury of being able to bash out a starting zone quickly to get back to where they were.
---
Lol literally impossible to please
---
I will give this a try. Thanks!
---
is the *what* broken??
---
I'm in love with the challenging part of leveling in classic. Every gear upgrade feels meaningful and has a noticable impact on leveling speed. 
---
I hope Blizzard takes notes and revamps the heirloom system on retail. Heirlooms take away all enjoyment of finding/crafting new gear pieces through quests and dungeon runs. I wish they would just turn the xp buff into an enchant or something (or just one item).
---
Thank you! Last night someone ran up to me and randomly gave me a few potions, I tried to chase them down to pay for them but they waved me off. Those potions saved my life more than once. I had no idea leveling warrior is this tough, haha
---
i felt like i was tripping going back in time on my dwarf paladin unreal experience
---
You know you can like classic without shitting on retail right?
---
5pm EDT happens when this comment is 3 hours and 19 minutes old.

You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/_oqynlysd
---
I went from Gehennas to
---
"Those servers"
---
But there is a queue on EVERY server? Where the fuck do I move then?
---
Even a simple keyboard macro. You are technically not against their TOS since you have no character gains for sitting afk (like in the case of BG afk). 
---
Until now all servers got rebooted, you might've been affected by that. Or crashed. 
---
Anyway... I know what must be done from now on.
---
i have my doubts that it was less than a minute....
---
I've switched 3 times. Queue every single time.
---
Imagine playing World of Storemounts.
---
No, u. Seriously though man. Chill. Blizz obviously wants this game to last - so trust me when I say they are doing exactly what needs to be done to ensure a healthy, long lasting game. Long queues are temporary... ESPECIALLY for people who are reasonable enough to switch when necessary at this early in the game.
---
"Yo guys, i'm making guides to an 15y old game for free and damn, you're all  a lot of potentional buyers who will play it again. So a week or so before i will try my best to act like these guides are none elsewhere to find for free and try hard as a working peon to get some money out of classic. Thats how capitalism works! I set an price expensive as fuck, you won't buy it and everyone but a tiny amout of idiots buying everything will moan and groan. So depeding on those tiny group of income i will sell it expensive like a 3 month sub or so. I'm a market genius! Love you all!"
---
OP thank you for a well thought out list of issues with the current way Blizz rolled this out. Thank you for offering what they should have done as well. I think Blizz should have released the number of servers currently active (15 or 20 for NA I believe) one week before launch, once they started seeing the huge response from the name reservations. 
---
As someone who was planning to play on Fairbanks but switched the morning of Launch I can confirm it is difficult and takes time to get friends to switch with you, it took me the entire weekend to convince the few friends I play with to switch. 
---
By releasing the new list one week before launch it would give ample time for people to convince their guild etc to make the change and therefore would be more likely to do so, I think time plays a big role in all this, it takes time to get people on the same page and no one wants to be the only guy that switches.
---
I think another big part of where Blizz went wrong is they underestimated the demand, I also think they overestimated the drop off. To be honest I don’t think a lot of people will quit in one week, I think it will be in one-two months when a casual player who plays ten-fifteen hours a week will hit the 30-40 range and really slow down.  I would expect these queues to continue for about a month during peak hours, hopefully only for 1-2 hour waits but still there.
---
I also think they should have communicated realm size better. We did get some blue posts about how Medium pop servers are larger than full servers back then but I don’t think the message sunk in. The majority of people logging in will be people who aren’t browsing the forums or on the subreddit, they also may not have played WoW since back in the day. Personally I still have it in my mind that LOW means dead server. With the current realm sizes LOW means just fine server.
---
That’s all I got.
---
The reason the queues are moving slower is that the server restarts this morning fixed the bug where the server did not save your spot if you disconnected. So in case of intentional or unintentional layer going down thingy, people would get stuck back in queue yesterday instead of just coming back.
---
So now only people who get permanently logged out are the ones who are AFK.
---
I can switch seamlessly between my desktop and the surface below using the same keyboard and mouse by using 3rd party software if that's what you mean.
---
Meh... bit of of over acting for views.
---
LMAO! That's fantastic!
---
If we pay a monthly sub fee and have switched servers numerous times, we should be entitled to play the game without waiting hours before getting in.
---
Its called an abbriviation
---
Those might be Blizzard's official rules, but the RP community (of Wyrmrest Accord, and MoonGuard at least) do not really follow that. You can talk in /say without going into character as long as you ((Do it in parentheses.)) And I don't know very many people who see the name rule as god. It is more about whether or not the name you have in your TRP or MRP (an external roleplay addon) profile.
---
Yes. I find it so fun because I set aside all the rush to achieve end game goals and just enjoy the journey for what it is.

how'd you get to blackrock mountain without an exploit then? And if so did you not use an exploit to kill the mob that drops the item? or was it a chest? being cryptic isn't really helping anyone when you say "not an exploit" but give no evidence to show that you didn't use an exploit. Still though I respect the hustle!
---
Feral druid here but I've popped out and saved the lives of a ton of randos that probably have no clue I was even there. I expect nothing in return, just doing a druids job of healing the land.
---
I agree with that. Heck, even modern voice systems and the "speed running" mindset upon release contribute to this too. I've been guilty the last two days of not speaking much in parties and whatnot in game as we've grouped with randos because Ive been on voice with friends.
---

This reminds me of something that happened to me on Monday. I was tried twice to get the chicken pet in Westfall, and both times, someone came by and killed the chicken right in front of me. What possesses a person to be so cruel?
---
Ya i love the community atm. Coming from someone who hasnt play a massive amount. Classic has really helped revive the game. Hope it dosent die anytime soon.
---
You can back out of queue and jump back in quickly. Same with once your in game. You can exit and then restart and jump back in if you’re quick enough.  
---
I’m not really willing to test how long “quick” is, but I’ve successfully restarted client and game to get an add on and I’ve had a friend successfully restart his computer and get back in.  
---
That said, I think the jumping in and out of queue grace period is shorter, because I’ve done it as a test when I first got into queue and I feel like it was around a minute or so.
---
I mean it's not rocket science. Take all the top servers, make 3 sub servers for each with shared names (just an example). Allow people to swap to the sub servers for free. If the populations start to die down, you can merge the servers with little issue because names are already shared between the servers.
---
Will sell the secret for 5 silver
---
They changed servers once.
---
Pretty much every PvP server is going to have long queues. The streamer servers will be even longer.
---
Yes. the common strat is to find a leveling spec that's useful for solo play and once you're max level swap to a group play spec
---
Damned if they do, damned if they don't. It's almost guaranteed the flood of players will die off months from now and those of you in it for the long haul complaining about queue times now would most definitely complain about dead servers if Blizzard dumped a bunch out at launch.
---
Many servers with no queue times now or a handful of healthy pop servers later, you can't have both. The tech does exist on retail to properly load balance servers, but the purist crowd would pitch a fit if any of that tech was used.
---
Or just let yourself die because no lifing a video game does nothing for our society
---
It could be optional expansions, also keeping true classic for the people that want that. But I get your point. But aren’t the seasons in Diablo 3 also appreciated because it gives new/more of the same content to grind? So this would move more towards diablo 3 than 2
---
You don't understand the meaning of waiting in line if you have not stood in a Communist line for rations... 
---
This is close to the same.
---
I can tell you right now 1/2 second YouTube search for classic wow mage weakauras will make your life so so much easier. Most ppl have paste bins you can copy pasta.
---
I look at all of these points,
---
* Losing names
---
* Community and economy needing to reorganise itself to a new equilibrium
---
* Faction balances might change
---
None of these matter. If this were all to the subject (and there might not be) you've just convinced me that realm merging is no big deal and the 2 second turmoil will reach a new equilibrium and life will go on.
---
The same thing will happen to Classic when each phase is released. I'm not saying there won't be *MORE* players at launch/phase releases, I'm saying if there are queue times for every freaking realm then it's silly to think any of them will be "dead" in a few months.
---
Money &gt; everything that's there philosophy
---
Also I logged in 25 mins before official launch,  waited 5 hours,  got in for literally 10 mins and the server crashed re Q for 7+ hour wait.  Sleep.  Wake up early try to log 6k wait says 2 hours,  drops to 500 in an hour, excited not so bad.  3 hours later still at 300.  WTF get the damn estimated time somewhere close this is ridiculous.  Today try to log 12k Q 380 min wait time jesus blizzard wtf I'm playing on one of your last minute bandaid servers, u screwed the pooch shameful.
---
I played mist for maybe 3 months and just wasnt hooked. Never thought I would ever play wow again tbh
---
I was out for two or three minutes, so I think you have maybe five to run on?
---
You'll be laughing when they need to go back to fight over low level herbs/ores/mobs because they forgot to do professions.
---
I really enjoy fishing strangely enough.
---
Being a good healer is nice, but it's when shit hits the fan and you start throwing out your LOH, clutch bubbles, blessings, and using your obscure "only works against undead" spells to save your party that playing a pally feels godly.
---
And do you know how that was received by the players ?
---
7k ? i just logged into a 20k 600 min queue
---
Third paragraph screams play rogue
---
4 hooves in 8 minutes? Pack it up everyone, we know who's getting world first 60.
---
you are so fucking lucky my dude

By classic standards, it can be. 15+ for me I consider time invested.

I enjoy healing and I want to play a priest. The problem is that I also want to play solo world pvp and I won't get an invite into raids as a shadow priest and as a holy I will only get healing items in raids according to some people. Is this true ? any way to get shadow priest gear for pvp ?
---
cool I'll hit you up if I can get past the damn queue tonight (didn't happen last night until after midnight). I'm alliance as well.

Excuse me, its called housing!

Like he said, they can just join a low pop server. Even in prime time yesterday I never had a queue on kurinnaxx.

Chrome Remote Desktop or Teamviewer
---
Understandable.. Got home from work now and I´m greeted by 7k people ahead of me in queue.. Hopefully can play in 2-3 hours or so..
---
My friends are on Stalagg and I sat in queue all night so you probably made a wise choice.
---
I'll look into that, thanks for the tip.
---
Mad Season&gt;Asmon
---
2 ?
---
People aren't going them because they released them after people invested hours into their characters, and if they switch servers they will still have a queue.
---
This also needs more upvotes to get anywhere 😜
---
stay strong brother. I support your decision. make an alt if u have to, but stay strong
---
I had a stroke when I saw that
---
Well that's always been a things in WoW.  Free crafting since it gives them profession skill points.
---
That was another thing I was considering. I've never played a healer role outside of a couple low level dungeons with a druid back in Cata. I know that priest is the de facto healing class, but I've heard good things about the single targeting of paladins.
---
It’s like you only read the underline.  I bet you only read news article titles too.
---
I really didn’t want to use elvui on classic but I may have to
---
Website was down yesterday.
---
We moved our group to Smolderweb. I hope the classic will hold more than enough attention and we can maintain healthy pop. The first wave servers are going to rough post-phasing too.
---
&gt;boring quest grinding
---
Yeah, exactly why I quit Wow years ago.  Leveling became tedious and boring - no challenge, no danger, no excitement. Just AOE down dozens at a time. Adds? No problem, just AOE more. 
---
Head to the next questgiver and click through the text and rince and repeat.
---
It is amazing to me that it even survived like this.
---
I'm assuming they're just looting chests in high level zones.
---
You didn't think you did but you did.
---
when I’m around you get Fortitude... YOU get fortitude! Fortitude for everybody!

Unmmm vanilla launch was way worst and this has absolutely zero to do with veteran people not being there.

''just reroll every single day''-the post
---
How is that mommys credit card.. Not everyone is homeless the fuck, its $15 a month. If you cant afford that, maybe there are better things to do than wow, just my opinion. You can be 7 years old and mow a law for $15 in 30 minutes.
---
Honestly it could be people coming from retail. I have definitely killed 3-4 enemies in one spot and only looted one because I’m used to aoe-looting. 
---
I don’t think most people intentionally avoid looting. 
---
Also getting bags is expensive (or luck based) so most people don’t have that much bag space either yet.
---
Using a second character to train the mobs away, or have you found one that isn't guarded?
---
My friends and i rolled on Kurinaxx last night.  I was able to jump on at 7pm EST with 0 wait.  Friend got a 10-20min queue around 10pm
---
They're going to wind down the layers as people spread out and get rid of them entirely by phase 2.
---
&gt; There should be no reason for anyone to do it
---
The reason to try it is if you are making plans to AFK with autoclicker in the future... tl;dr fuck that friend
---
Suck it up. Go to a low pop server. This is part of the classic wow experience. #YouThinkYouDoButYouDont
---
The highest levels in the game are literally hunters solo questing right now.
---
Journey and Joker for example.
---
&gt; million
---
How did we arrive at this number?
---
Feels good coming home from work and joining a 8k queue.
---
I've been in queue more than I've played. Almost impossible to play if you work 8-5
---
I don’t think he’s looking for coolness I think he’s trying to connect to a group of players like himself just like the rest of us are...except you...uninstall
---
But the major advertisement server they used to promote people to start two weeks early was very flawed. Do you not see that?
---
That's good to hear! :) I've spent the past half-hour just making and trading healthstones to passersby, lol. It's so fun using the macros to do it!
---
whiny lip bitch
---
That's odd... The queue should be moving uniformly for everyone. Someone else in the queue went straight from 4k to 1k, while I stayed at the same position. Yours should not have staggered that close.. I'm wondering how the queue position is calculated and if its an actual position or just an estimate. It also often goes up by 1-2 spots.
---
This is so true. I resubbed about a month ago to get back into WoW and thought I would get my old 110 to 120 before Classic hit. I jumped in and very few things were actually that exciting. It started to become a chore and the character only made it to 116 before I realized I wasn't enjoying playing and decided I'd rather just watch whatever Classic WoW videos I could find instead.
---
Not sure about WoW specifically, but other games have been known to go through the roof on menu screens
---
I am currently in queue for the last 2 hours and it probably will be another couple of hours. 
---
The gods look down on what I wrote here and punish me for my insolence. 
---
I am sorry, friend. I understand now
---
So dumb...
---
Always. Be. Closing.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
RIP, at least I wont be there to see the massive dicks, I mean queues.
---
I bet Blizzard lost a huge amount of potential long-term players due to the mess of this launch.
---
Good luck with your perma-ban from Netflix for botting /s
---
A Chinese mage can't type his name on my phone lol
---
real stoners dont post this shit cus we lit all day baby
---
They have no idea. They logged in to a 10 year old character, in content no one has done in a decade, saw some ui stuff that they weren't familiar with, were disappointed that their guild didn't wait years for them and formed a rock solid opinion to share with everyone on reddit. They are also lying.
---
Their tails swaying in conjunction is oddly satisfying
---
We had a shaman tank but 5 players. Worked like a charm.
---
Bro just move to America Bro....
---
That would be extremely frustrating.
---
But yea, your post title is a bit dramatic.  If you're tired, then don't.  Simple as that.  Or just wait a week and try logging on then.  I bet you'll have a lot more luck.
---
Daddy, the game is up! Can I play now? "No, it's daddy's turn."
---
It's completely unacceptable on Blizzards part. Submitted service tickets about the queues and instead of providing a reasonable response Blizzard support pretty much said just deal with it. They don't care that players have to wait hours.

Started playing in Wrath. Off on for years. Played BFA and am intrigued in Classic. What's the content progression look like? Will it just follow the expansions? What's stopping it from mirroring current WoW?

Why not use more layers so we don't need to queue if they aren't adding new servers anyway?

Those pillagers damage wtf. Good thing you can keep them from doing any damage by LOSing their long ass casts.

I'd like to see temp bans for folks using macros / automation to avoid the auto-disconnect when they aren't playing.

100% a band-aid for the situation right now but at least it'd be a little something.
---
I've been reporting folks when I see it but I don't know how closely those reports are being monitored right now.
---
You think you want it but you don't. This identifies their clear bias against classic. The dick who said this is now the CEO. This will not be fixed until this mentality is expunged from Blizzard.
---
yo ...can you make an udemy course to easy life tips
---
Yeah I saw that last night too.
---
Generally it was (on Pagle) 
---
* 3s for a bag, or
---
* 50c and 6 linen for a bag (ie the mats needed, minus the thread), or
---
* 9 linen for a bag.
---
Seemed pretty fair.
---
With regular remote desktop I can play a lot of games that are not too heavy on graphics pretty seemlessly.  Wow plays fine as long as I don't try to use right click to turn / look.  As soon as I do that it spins around and looks directly up.  Oh well, I think it is just an issue with the 3D games like that.
---
Played an elemental shaman at the start of BFA. Still needed to play it smart when pulling two mobs. 3 mobs? Blow all your cooldowns unless you are dead LOL
---
I am waiting 7 hours already. lmao.
---
myep I think I wont resub this week
---
maybe next week its better but god am I salty
---
Better buffs and better wanding, what more could you ask from a leveling spec? Disc master talent tree
---
I mean you don’t have to...
---
Ooh maybe was youcantmilkthese definitely something very close!
---
Why can't you play classic now?
---
I just play an alt on a less populated server. No biggie. Might even become my main. Much better than watching an hours long queue. I do wish they would crack down on afk folks staying logged in. I think that’s selfish and makes the whole queue problem intractable.
---
What's the status of Grobbulus queue
---
No that was just last night I got to level 11 on launch night.
---
 Took about 3 hours to get through the queue so only made it from 11-14.5 last night in 3 hours
---
In classic wow you get all the skills regardless of what you choose in the talent tree. So go arms spec as your leveling, then for dungeons you can throw on a one hand weapon and shield to tank in defensive stance. So yeah, you can level as dps and then tank dungeons without changing your talent tree (which costs money to respec)
---
Every popular zone Inn is filled with AFKers who obviously have something set up so they don't get booted.
---
Today at 10am I logged on a low pop realm (that is currently full with over 4k queu) and came into Kharanos Inn as a level 5. When I finished leveling 3 hours later and level 9 the same 4 characters were still there in the same spot with 3 new ones joining in on the fun. The queue started at 2pm and it only grew from there. 
---
GMs should be hunting these people down. I know it's a lot of work but man these queues that aren't going anywhere are strictly because people aren't logging off and are sleeping IRL + gaining rested xp.
---
Chrome Remote Desktop is probably a better bet as long as you have a smartphone. More versatile and not banable.
---
It depends on what you want to do. Do you want to further your utility in combat? Do you want to make gear for yourself so you can customize better and not have to rely as heavily on raid drops? Do you want to make miscellaneous items to improve quality of life, like big ol' bags to carry your stuff in? Or maybe do you want to just make that bread and buy everything? There are a ton of viable options. Just pick the ones you vibe with most.
---
i miss Chris :(
---
Granted, they use the leftover money to buy alt accounts and multi box. This makes que times even longer
---
Thats not such a bad Idea, might start a new char in retail.
---
just log in 4Head
---
Don't give away this secret! I almost did, but decided to delete my post instead.
---
Mage or paladin for sure. Low APM high damage
---
So not only are you happy to stop other people playing by taking up server space when you're not actively using it, but you're also boasting about it to the people who can't play... Cool?

I got to level 38 on 14 different characters and has transferred to all the new realms 1 by 1 BUT NAH cant play NAH queue fuck yeah
---
It’s crazy right. 
---
I went through Rift, SWTOR, GW2 (for mmorpgs.)  Even played OSRS off and on. 
---
Also wasted time on SMITE,  LoL, overwatch, apex legends, and other FPS games throughout the years. 
---
Never spent more than 2-3 months at a time with each game listed above. 
---
Yet here I am back on classic with more desire and itch to play than any of those games combined. Crazy!
---
Are you sure you are connecting to classic? Are you sure you scrolled down the server list in case you switched the order of the servers? Are you sure you are logged in to the right bnet account? Are you sure you didn't just drunkenly delete your characters in a fit of rage?
---
All of these seem infinitely more likely than your character data (and only your character data) mysteriously going missing.
---
Ouch!
---
use google remote desktop app on your phone, log into wow 2-3 hours before you leave work via remote desktop, que, and get home and profit.
---
I would say Loch Modan depending on level but it's personal preference I think.
---
No, a lot of retail players are playing classic lol...it is just getting annoying to see all the bfa related posts on here though
---
&gt; You just have to know what you're doing.
---
u are 4 randoms some of whom could be actually new players
---
Just turn them on in name settings and bind all your keys to action bars.
---
I'm a rational being. You say stupid shit I call you stupid
---
The game is alive 15 years later, is still the king of the MMO market and they were able to just release their first iteration with the selling point "NOTHING HAS CHANGED!" 
---
Just retreading classic for 15 years straight isn't feasible.
---
Just Keep an eye on it. I’ve done this both days so far and have been in game when I got home and played all night with no issues
---
What is said is that this post is not sarcasm
---
You are correct. Even though abusing the system comes from players, the reason for abuse is because Blizzard messed up. I know my post might sound like I'm blaming the players but I'm not english native speaker and it's hard for me to point out how the issue kind of feeds itself.
---
It gives me great joy.
---
I don’t make the rules. This is what Blizzard has stated.
---
Classic has always been advertised as “Free with an active subscription.”
---
How does the realmlist in China look like?
---
Blizzard is definitely alienating a lot of potential long-term players with this mess.
---
Bro, just reroll country bro.
---
Holy paladins are the best single target healers and PvP healers. Priests are still better in giant raid healing environments.
---
Why do you guys have so many characters already? I only have one.
---
I got the Lt. insignia on my second kill.

This works, thanks!
---
Hey sounds like me! I played thousands of hours from vanilla to Cata and then have not logged in since, Classic has me back!
---
And good luck actually getting the mob you need for quests. Here’s a hint: 10 other people want the same one. Oh I’m sorry, not 10, it’s actually 30
---
I cannot wait to play classic. I started playing during cataclysm, and continued on to MOP, WOD, LEGION, and BFA. It's all I've ever known. I love WoW, but I guess the main reason why I possibly wouldn't play classic is cause of people like ***you.***
---
Give me a chance to play classic and enjoy it, retail after Cata is all I have ever known.
---
Damn I was thinking that Warrior was super impressive. But he's leveling in dungeons obviously. Still impressive, but not as much as if it was doing the impossible lol
---
You knew the 5 most popular server would have a huge queue for a week at least. What did blizzard do wrong? They openned servers but y'all keep waiting 4 hours instead of just switching...
---
I highly doubt that lol
---
Str is good for bear and cat druids too
---
i dont think it's very pricy but naw you don't have to do that, a signature will be enough! I may make it when I get home from work today! I'll add you and let you know!
---
What you're seeing right now is high queues because its new and a bunch of people who are gonna end up quitting the game before they even hit 60. A full server can easily survive the mass exodus to come, but one of these new low pop servers likely won't.
---
Done
---
wand?
---
The 2 servers i have rolled on have has basically the same convos in general chat.
---
1.boomers vs. zoomers, usually fairly memey, but some people seem to get legit upset and start popping off
---
2.Anyone that speaks anything that isnt english should be bullied/banned
---
3.”Did somebody say Thunderfury”
---
~150.000 people in queue for all English speaking realms (not German/Russian/French) atm.
---
Questie is ok, I’ve had better in the past like quest helper.
---
&gt;disappointment for people who do so and find out Classic endgame isn't the best part of the game
---
To you. Plenty of people keep dungeon spamming and speedrunning to cut whatever they hate most about Classic: Leveling.
---
Read a little about the real history of Europeans and PvPing.
---
What?  When did that stupid happen?
---
Wait what? I heard it was 1G/5G/10G etc in ascending order based on how much/often you respec?
---
That’s what I’m looking for, command would be the best to use but I can’t figure out how to use it
---
Sounds like you're 9n the wring server, bud. On grobbulus, I literally can't even do a single quest without running into 10 other people in the same spot automatically inviting me, since everybody knows we're all there for the same mobs, no sense fighting over them. I haven't even asked once, still get constant invites.
---
I suppose your class may have something to do with it
---
I find this funny because I recall talking about these kind of mistakes when suggesting a confirm button for talents and got a lot of shit for it. On this sub,  too. Imo dont worry about it until you're max level. Save that money for grinding out that mount.
---
Don’t hate the player hate the game
---
You gotta baby sit it and if you get logged in somehow, gotta get her to keep you from AFK'ing... I haven't had much luck with this or with her leveling up my toons, I mean what is she doing all day?!?
---
I tried to set up teamviewer on my home pc so I could log into it and start the Queue around lunch buuuut it says Teamviewer is not on that pc. Damn. No Classic for me tonight.
---
How? I've been in the Firemaw que for over 9 hours now. I logged in at 11am today. Still not in and there were "only" 10k in que.
---
he was never seen again
---
Trying to decide on professions for a mage. Level 10 and I’ve taken up tailoring and skinning, but I would eventually like to take up enchanting instead of skinning. Skinning is something I picked right now, basically for money making, but would it be a lot worse to take up enchanting now?
---
Why can't I see it?
---
If you’re actually going to level your bank, aspect of the cheetah is great to have for running between bank, AH, and mailbox.
---
Tell your boss to change your work hours.
---
LOLOLOL THIS KILLED ME 😂😂
---
It's much easier to scan for afk behaviour in BGs, since there's very little overlap between legitimate reasons to being "afk" and actually being afk.
---
You could sit on some chair for like an hour for some elaborate RP reason, but from the perspective of blizzard you're just as likely to be an afker.

---
Wait they don’t anymore.... what have they done to the new version... glad I quit years ago I guess.
---
Make new friends, ditch the old-timer and bully him with your superior progress at the dinner table.
---
There was no reason not to have opened more servers when they saw the heavy name reservations. We're also living in 2019 where there's no need for static servers - they should have added additional capacity and merged when/if population declined as they've done in the past. Instead you subject people to waiting 3-4 hrs to log in, obviously interest is going to die off.
---
Unless you're ocd about it just keep on going my dude
---
You'll end up with way more than 1g and respeccing way more than once in the long run anyway
---
They stated it would be disruptive to the community.
---
The "dead server" maybe not everyone would want to move, so it would still be even deader.
---
Also the realm you will transfer to will already have a stable community and they wouldn't like 10000 "refugees" coming to their server with maybe cool items and that can disrupt the economy.
---
Man, is it just me or is everyone so much nicer on Classic?
---
Just remote in from work and join the queue. I do it from class a couple hours before I'm done for the day so I can at least be a couple hours into the queue before coming home
---
I ran Deadmines yesterday where every single member was a mana user (Druid tank) and felt like a god handing out full stacks to my party.
---
It’s one talent doesn’t really matter much while leveling.
---
DoT and OOM count as acronyms!
---
The forums had issues a little while ago and there was a message at the top of the pages stating so. That is probably why you couldn't post.
---
So would you say tanking gear is viable in pvp in any way, or should i go for grand marshal in phase two?
---
Completely agree but would still love for people who are new to have the ability to try it out without a huge barrier to entry . More money for blizzard and more players for the community. It is a win win
---
What about staying logged in with remote access? No rules actually been broken there
---
Wait, you legit think right clicking a mob tags before instant cast spells?
---
For me I’ve already put 16 hours into my character.  When you work a full time job and have a family that’s a huge investment.  I don’t want to start over.  Blizz should let people transfer from full realms to the new ones for free.
---
Honestly hope it stays this popular, I want classic to be a thing for a long time
---
I kinda did this. Was still in a guild somehow. There was even someone I used to play with online. They never responded to me though. I did try starting some new characters to get a feel for how the game changed. Leveling was stupid easy. I usually level solo, so not seeing another player wasn't that big of a deal. The lack of any sort of challenge made it not really fun.
---
The classic servers at medium are vanilla servers full.
---
Journey slept for 10+ hours already.
---
Last night literally every single server had a queue, EVERY one was full
---
This was a bit harsh man, and I'm someone who considers himself a down right shitbag.
---
And most if not all of these queues are insanely long wait times.  I am personally fortunate enough to work from home so I can jion in on a 30 minute queue before work and then just afk run in a tavern all day so that I can play when I get off.  But It is definitely disappointing to not be able to play.
---
&gt; they just need to popup a confirm box after 1 hour where you need to type in something, this would stop 90% of the afk scripts or macros being used, 
---
so you think it's possible to script something like fishing, where it recognizes the bobber's color against the background water and clicks it when it moves, but clicking a pop-up is above the scripter's abilities?
---
A pop-up would be trivial to defeat.
---
Probably, my friend was only support and not even a team lead but I got a few free years and some free collectors edition keys.
---
I started at 3pm, had to wait over 10 hours to even get in. Fuck that.
---
You are always free to go start another community of like minded individuals somewhere else
---
I honestly think from tommorow I'm going to use Chrome Remote Desktop to start the queue early from my mobile at work, and hopefully have the game ready to be played once I get home.
---
There is couple chests in EPL/WPL you can get without aggroing.
---
Metzen created Soldier 76, arguably one of the most iconic characters of Overwatch. So yeah, he was involved somewhat.
---
Time of the day, most people are home from work now. I was able to get on 1st try 4 or 5 hours ago. Stuck in a queue now though, was always going too happen
---
Wait until they're dead by the Org AH :D
---
well obviously grand marshal but are you willing to spend 18 hours a day for 3 months to get there?
---
Ya but I've now wasted a point in the incorrect tree. Maybe you're right though I should just uninstall and commit suicide by hanging myself and ingesting sleeping pills, I'll include you in the note
---
I had an instant queue on thunderfury last night.
---
Woah.....are you me?
---
There gotta be some middle ground. At some point it conveys panic, arrogance or worse
---
My buddy and I were struggling against a higher level quest mob and there was a crowd of around 4-5 spectators that never lifted a finger. Felt great to eventually kill it and /spit on those bystanders.
---
That's my favorite part about MotW, don't have to be facing the target
---
literally all EU servers are high pop or full, also, eat shit.
---
Thank you! Gonna get this going tonight :)
---
When the post is good but we gotta keep the secret in New...
---
*Upvote/downvote buttons with guy sweating meme*
---
Ah, then I misunderstood. Nice jo :)
---
shartard/sharttard
---
Yes but if getting gear from questing. They like to change your weapon periodically. Also when yoj get your first green and its a different type.
---
Fuck you racist
---
Is this cowboy equipped with magical powers against Indians armed with nothing but styrofoam sticks?
---
You realize at this moment every single EU realm is full?
---
No that is their excuse for doing this to the community. They have no frame of reference to determine player fall off as during original wow all they saw was rising subscriptions. They are likely determining these attrition rates based on their own garbage developments such as cata, wod and bfa. They are guessing with a jaded opinion which is driving this fiasco. CEO needs to go if he cannot recognize classic will eclipse retail if they allow it.
---
Man, I killed like 5 murlocs trying to get to a chest and some gnome lock just walks up and loots it while I'm killing #6.
---
No arcane int buff for you!
---
I predict a lot of shade towards people who have genuine reactions to stuff not only "retail babies" will find annoying and then calling people retail baby if they show anything other than gratitude for being able to play the game. 
---
I mean I get it.. but why not welcome people instead of pointing fingers.
---
Idling is your friend.
---
Can't tell if this is a meme comment or not
---
There are still limitations as to how many players can be on a server. There's vastly more players on classic servers compared to vanilla. Can't get away from the fact that there there are cpu, memory, and bandwidth limits.
---
Typo, I ment BFA is free with a subscription. They are both advertised as free with a subscription . Because for both we no longer buy the actual game.
---
You are assigned a layer once you login and you will only see players of the same layer. The layer is for the entire world, not just 1 zone. However if you group up with a friend, you move to his layer (depends who invites who). Yes the layering is pretty much invisible, you just won't see players from other layers.
---
As far as I heard, there were issues with layering during the beta but those were bugs that have been fixed (like your layer changing when going into a capital city, which was a bug).
---
Good mod.
---
If you think thats "Killing" Classic WoW you really gotta re-evaluate some things.
---
As I clicked the title...
---
"Who the fuck are 'we'?"
---
I like ClassicCodex a lot.
---
I havent waited in a single queue since the first hour of release, im not sure why theres all this whining of people waiting hours to "just play" when there are in fact open servers. The reality is you're trying to get on a streamer server, play with a friend who dumbly chose a high pop server, or are too scared to give up your lvl 5 account to switch to a less populated server. Just do it, quit spamming the reddit with this babble
---
That was rhetorical, my bad.
---
I haven't noticed it at all lol
---
&gt; Is it a valid opinion to think that people would be happier with more layers per server (or more servers) and a higher possibility of eventually having to transfer servers due to over/underpopulation? Being able to actually play the game seems like it might be worth the cost of an eventual transfer and any server community concerns aren't really valid until we're down to 1 layer anyway.
---
This is definitely an option.  The downside would be this - they sping off enough layers so that everyone on Whitemane or Faerlina is able to play.  Everyone's happy, but no one knows how overcrowded the server they picked is.  In 4 months they remove layering and suddenly people are irate that there's a 5 hour queue for their server (assuming the population drops significantly through phase 1).  You're kind of burying the problem.  You can open up free server transfers to new servers like you said, but at that point I'm guessing people are even *more* tied to their server and less willing to move.  Maybe not, but given how upset people were about the prospects of not moving servers or losing the character names at launch, I'm skeptical that people would be happy in either scenario.
---
Well right now we can't even join our guilds if they are on populated server and Blizz's solution is "just ditch everyone you know" which seems far more disruptive
---
I wish I knew what the servers were like, but unfortunately I have not gotten to experience the game yet. I work full time and by the time I get home there is a queue long enough that would go past when I need to go to bed and get up for work again the next day. Even if I stayed up pretty late I don't think I would get past the wait screen. Hopefully the weekend will be better, but I am not getting my hopes up. I am hopeful that these long queues will die down in a week or two.
---
Didn’t know that thanks!
---
They probably realize it’s three days after launch and most of their player base doesn’t even know what the hell they enjoy. You literally have people saying that they are having fun because they can give out buffs and they die more and shit. Like that’s just so far up your own ass I don’t even know where to begin
---
I love it everytime it happens! But um....noob question...how do I thank people? I just scream THANK YOU to my screen and continue to be thankful for the Angels among the assholes.
---
yea just... stab with the wand
---
What the fuck, dude?  12 hours, that’s insane. Took me 6 hours to get into Shazzrah.
---
No? Servers are fine. Zero part of the issue is server stability/load.
---
Man... Incendius suddenly with a queue in the middle of the day, sigh
---
Hate to break it to you, but it's not the younger players asking for this. The game has shifted to cater to the "I have 2 jobs, 3 wives and 12 children to take care of so I only get about 17 minutes a night to play and it isn't fair that these kids all have better gear than me" crowd. Like most complaints about younger generations, all you have is projection.
---
Pretty sure I’ve come across and done stuff with you in westfall. NE priest named Kurisu!
---
Memory access?
---
Awesome
---
Easy. Got to bed after work, get up at 3am and play. And yes I actually did that yesterday and I'm currently about to hit the sack and do it again...

---
Outhouse in Searing Gorge.  Sort of a play on words, as well, if you had mexican food.
---
Imagine playing classic wow on a PvE realm.
---
Now y’all can stop bitching
---
people paying people to show them how to play a game xd
---
Fuck this!
---
People taking time off is exactly why the queue is starting at 9am.
---
As far as characters go you gotta buy your skills from a trainer and then each class has certain weapon skills they can learn which I’m not sure if you buy dif ones or if you just gotta train them. But there’s also class quests later in down the road that you’ll get certain spells from or even mounts for paladins and warlocks. 
---
And as for questing there’s add ones you can get like quest helper that help find quest objectives and stuff easier cuz sometimes they’re a little difficult. But honestly other than that I feel like going in blind is the best way to experience it. If you can find a group of people to play with consistently or just groups to join it makes it a lot more fun. 
---
When you die you can res immediately at the spirit healer with no repercussions until level 10 but every time you die your armor degraded a little bit. Also money is a little harder to come by at first and so you may be a little pressed for a bit depending on how often you go back to town to sell stuff or have to repair armor. 
---
Sorry if this doesn’t answer terribly much. A lot of it will come in time but don’t be afraid to ask other players for help or post in the zones general chat either!
---
This seems to be exactly right.  And people remotely logging in too.

Vanilla is a non-epic, green rarity, simply designed sword that does 2-5 damage... Retail is a super ultra rare mega awesome weapon that is "rare" (not really) with epic design and does 2-5 damage... that you transmog to look like that non-epic green rarity sword... from vanilla.

How retarded are you ?? all of our servers are full.
---
Razorgore, 10k - 359min que

100% agree and there are still plenty of trash cans out there. The mob tagging like you said. Had a guy /spit on me because I invited him to a group for a kill quest Haha.

on my realm we got The Dark Brotherhood and The Darker Brotherhood xD

No, they don't. Click the credits button on the client, they have four programmers.
---
Character transfers don't guarantee you'll have the name on the destination server..
---
I don't even know if I can do that now.  Every realm in EU is full, with Hydraxian Waterlords, the RP server, being high.  Even on a newer server there's still a 3k queue.
---
This is really taking the wind out of my sails.  I get less excited for classic each day I can't actually play.
---
if you solopull a questmob when there's people around waiting for it, expect them to watch you die :D
---
Layers don’t add to the the total population of the server.  There’s still only 3000 people logged in.  It’s 4 layers of 750 people, it’s to prevent 1000 people fighting over a limited amount of mobs is the starting area.
---
Everyone's resorting to doing this so it shouldn't matter much longer.
---
EU too or just US?
---
naa Canada is basically Europe
---
If you plan on playing pvp a lot, definitely druid. Their flag running in warsong is crazy. Still very good heals, plus the ability to stealth away and hide or ambush. Plus if you're a night elf, you can shadowmeld and eat/drink up. Plus it would be healthy for your party comp in case you ever get bored of shadow priest.
---
I have been disconnected several times due to blizzards servers and had the grace period still. I know it wasn’t just my internet because when I log back in 20 secs later everyone in the barrens is saying the just got disconnected as well.
---
Druids are super fun to heal with and there are not many of them in Vanilla, that's all I can say

Ah. I misunderstood what you were saying; the shared name pool part basically went in one eye and out the other after I read server merges. I agree with you 100%

Mages are a perpetual motion machine. How have I never realized this

&gt; NO FUCKING SHARDING. It is so refreshing to see a huge zone FULL of people. Even If it means it's harder to do quests, it feels like a big world we all share again!
---
I love current classic but on my full populated EU server there is Sharding. It is very well done and barely noticable tho. I was trading wool to a player for bags in redrige, while also joining a DM group and all of a sudden all players around me dissapeared and changed into others. Had to leave party and party up with the tailor to get my bags from the right shard, was hilarious.

They have opened a ton of new servers to make queues better. Obviously queues are bad on some servers. They told us that would happen before launch.  If you are willing to change servers, you can find servers with small queues and shorter waits. I only had to wait once for 25 minutes and 5 other times just logged on instantly.    
---
Looking back, they should have started with more servers. So people wouldn't have to move or face these queues.    
---
What they are doing now is keep opening new servers so there are always medium pop or full pop servers you can get into relatively quickly.   
---
Yes, they could have someone just keep replying on Twitter or post a lot on reddit, but it probably wouldn't help much.  I guess you and some people would be happy if they kept saying "we know about the problem and will keep opening new servers. we're sorry".

Step 1) Choose a server you aren't going to leave due to queues lol
---
Step 2) Make sure people on that server are high enough level (No one is starting guilds on a 3 hour old server)
---
Step 3) Adventure and actually make yourself a prospect to have
---
Step 4) Watch chats, go to major cities. Guilds who want you are looking
---
Step 5) Realize guilds on fresh servers are new just like you and give them time. Leave ones you don't like and stay at ones you do. You'll eventually find a home. Don't be afraid to leave guilds that die, but also give them a little bit of time to take off before you jump ship.
---
Kinda. Only difference is Rotating affixes every week which make the dungeons harder. And also bunch of different dungeons.

Well I mean, retail isn't played by more people though, is it? It's healthy but it's dying more and more every month.
---
Shhhhh don’t tell them!
---
Welp, there it is. Either we're on our way to permanent layering or we're on our way to permanent 3 hour queues and a bunch of dead servers. So much for thinking about the long term.
---
It's quite possible blizzard is doing quick restarts to combat it. It has been working for me.
---
We thought you didn't but you did.
---
U have 10min to log back in
---
If they are waiting till there are no more layers on any server before releasing Phase 2, it might be quite awhile.
---
I see, I've been doing that but never asked for leveling zones just for a quest location or things like that. Thanks for the advice.

Wish they'd give numbers... Still 12k in queue for Mograine EU

It just looks better keeping consistent models, technically orcs and troll s and taurens should be far larger than humans, but unless you want all doors massive, they had to compromise somewhere.

Id be ok with it if they retconned the wow lore and made it so everyone becomes a leader based only on height, like the irken empire!

Q
---
Yesterday when I came home at that exact time there was 1 single server not listed as full, literally not true what you are saying. 
---
If a server is opening and free it is filling up within a matter of hours and also getting a queue, I know this because I literally fucking joined a new realm, got DC'd and put in a 2 HOUR LONG QUEUE.
---
Tailoring is great for new players, stick with it. However maxing enchanting is kinda hard
---
Guilds are going to use 5-8 priests, and 1-2 druids.
---
I'm hoping that Classic's success will do something major to the next expansion to make it feel original like this.
---
Let other people change servers. I want to play with my friends.
---
How very League of Legends of you, Classic WoW.
---
Because this literally happens every time how do people not learn?
---
I have been main resto Druid for almost all my wow playtime. I think it’s the most fun healing and gives a lot of variety during levelling with the shapeshift. 
---
Also, now I don’t remember how it was played in vanilla, but pvp with Druid resto is a blast. Since you can shapeshift to other forms applying stuns, bleed and avoiding mana drain
---
Go up to Wrath, and then instead of cata and the sundering, just make something new. And alternate timeline or universe where DW doesnt wake and destroy shit, and just make a new tale, while keeping the spirit of vanilla
---
No it doesn’t, but at least my guild and friends if we wanted could all swap servers, or have the option too without losing progress.

Are you using remote access to wiggle your character every 14 mins while at work all day? Kudos, that takes dedication

This game just isn't for you it sounds like, which is perfectly fine. Classic is all about slow methodical decision making. In that cave you ran in too far and aggrod an extra mob and found out that they are immune to fear. It sucked, but you learn from it and know to take things slower next time and wait until they are solo. For that herb you went for and got jumped by 4 boars you also weren't paying attention to your surrounding when walking up to it. You need to have situational awareness at all times in the wilderness of classic and for many of us that is the appeal. You can't just zone out and clear through an area, you need to at least somewhat focus, even at low levels.
---
Oh yeah. I believe on live servers if you want to play Alliance you don't roll on thrall because like 80% of the playerbase is horde. And I don't remember which one is Alliance dominated. And whether you like it or not moonguard will always have a reputation. But that's probably true. We don't even know yet which servers they're going to keep after launch so there's probably not much sense in worrying about which to join.
---
Last night I had mark, thorns, and scroll of protection at the same time. It was heavenly.
---
Dont worry, you can blame Blizzard, everything is their fault remember
---
That sucks but that's vanilla. He will likely get annoyed at someone else screwing him too
---
Agreed especially when you do get in
---
Me when I get aggroed by 3+ vampire duskbats while trying to grab scarlet crusader quest objectives
---
Says who? “Fuckn retard 98”? How fitting.
---
The amount of traffic generated to their servers is astronomical.
---
It’s been like two days. Oh and, by the way, when you’re logged in, server runs smooth. Despite an influx of players great than we’ve probably ever seen.
---
But millenials had to wait so now they’re angry :(
---
we up number of pplz to play this game that you should quit cuz bfa is better. but now you can have less queue or no quuee. lay bfaaa prease
---
I believe even the lowest pop normal/pvp realms have multiple layers worth of people on them. You don’t need hours worth of queue to have a normal sized realm once layering is gone. We will see in a few months though.
---
Lol dude, just go back to retail.
---
There is no "speed dungeons" in this beggining.
---
Warriors get better around level 30 IMO.  Paladins stay the same heh.  Rogues are constant button mashing, watching energy/combo points.
---
Both are shitty, yet if you choose to sit in an 8 hour queue instead of a 3, you are contributing to the problem.
---
He gets a free mount, he doesn’t care
---
Nice!  I'll probably still remote into my PC to login an hour or two before leaving work though.

That's something I'm kinda worried about. I want to make smolderweb my main server but I'm kinda unsure of it because I don't know if it will stay alive after the hype dies down. Am I just over thinking this?

Why are the queues so bad? I thought layering was supposed to flex out wide to help. Are the queues not there to slow the logon, to prevent a crash, but because the server is already at max capacity? The amount of people I see AFK is really high.
---
Weird thought: due to the fact that there is no queue early in the morning and there are hours of waiting in the night, Classic Wow may actually fix my sleep schedule
---
Now is the time for looking through your bags and deleting whatever sells for the least to make room.

---
Give tanking a shot too, you may enjoy it. With that however you will most likely not tank any raids (no taunt skill is a big deal there) but can still tank dungeons. It'll be expensive but you can respec for raids to be holy then run around as ret or prot or just dont raid at all and do dungeons/pvp as ret having a good time.
---
What server is this?
---
Make it past the port of entry?
---
Westfall is so... The riverpaw gnolls I must have killed 100 to get 6 paws. People grouped with me and finished 2-3 times before I finished mine. It was soul crushing watching people join me late and loot back to back paws.
---
With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing. We expect this to result in smaller queues for realms that have large queues, and some realms should no longer have queues at all.
---
We will closely monitor performance and stability throughout this process.
---
Thank you very much.
---
They said they have the capability to increase the server capacity but didn't want to due to it causing layering issues in P2.
---
Hey could you link me the discord bro?
---
Im in a guild called Order Of Elements,which as Warlock sounds weird to join :D
---
No it was very hyped and many people were looking forward to it. I didnt say it was trash or want trash. I said people were hyped for it and came back to try it out, people were hyped for at the end of the day and saying it was trash doesnt change the fact there was hype for it, just like every other expansion they all have had hype around it.
---
Just wish they would use the updated 3D models for classic..
---
Me, my friends and practically everyone in general chat on the Aus PVP server are having a blast. I honestly haven't seen a single person bitch about it besides from a few people doing it sarcastically. Where's LFG, why does my mana run out, where are the quest markers etc.
---
It won't be long term if they correctly handle this though. If people go back, and then they eliminate layering causing substantial queues they could offer 2 options:
---
1. Stay and deal with it. 
---
2. Free transfer back off to a lower pop realm and take everyone you want with you. 
---
People are free to go back to big servers regardless. This simply allows people to play while blizzard can see how many people are dedicated to stay.
---
I mean, I’m trying man, but this shit a tad too funny while I roam the stranglethorn killing you noobs.
---
It's not. Incendius has a queue over 3k currently.

Nice !

Is he actually racing?

Same here. I’m more focused on the lore and exploration of the game then maxing out quickly for gear. Hell im just here for the grind and pvp. May even make a lvl 19 twink as wel

Thanks! Right now I am on 4k queue from 18k at EU Razorgore, so hope to play today without zombie mode next day at work, so tomorrow will be the day :)

One reason I stopped playing retail WoW. I missed the methodical approaches using CC and communication for each pull. Looking forward to this again :)

When I had no friends in highschool (except WoW) Morhaime and Metzen were my heroes. WoW gave me online friends to talk and hang out with.

Yes because that's how the game was back then, personally I don't mind re-lvling my chars if I know that those are the only chars that am gonna play for the rest of my life

Yes, one guild created the main discord server to be able to control communication within the server, dumbasses made those messages public and had an entire guild meeting public on twitch talking about trying to control all the resources and world bosses on the server since they think rp players are noobs and casuals. They also said they dont think rp players have the "brainpower to run a smear campaign".
---
Another guild, apparently from 4chan, is full of racist bigots. But I dont know much about that.
---
I mean two guilds so far wont corrupt the rest of the server but it definitely leaves a sour taste
---
They're gonna do realm transfers.
---
what gear lasted until TBC? i know thunderfury was still valuable/useful, and nightfall was used until they changed the proc rate for people above level 60, but i can't think of any other level 60 item that was earnestly used at level 70 TBC, outside of just being super unlucky with drops or something.
---
i do remember using the darkmoon card that revives you in arenas though, that was hilarious when it worked.
---
&gt;I DO NOT HAVE A HUGE TEAM OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OR GENIUSES TO DO SO, BUT I FIGURE YOU MIGHT BLIZZARD?
---
I'll admit don't know what I'm talking about here, but I'm almost certain that there is a switch that's not properly flipped. Once they find the correct switch and flip it, all the queues will instantly go away and everyone will be happy forever. So come on Blizz, just flip that switch!
---
&gt;As a master of laws
---
And as a master of ceremonies at my niece's bat mitzvah, I concur with my colleague that the Blizzard's attitude toward these queue times is a shande! I feel so bad kvetching over all this but, oy vey, it's just too much!
---
You wouldn't be able to pass the login session from your PC to his PC.
---
You would need to PCS at your house and you have to log them both in on separate PC's.
---
Devil's advocate, what about the other people (who also paid to play something) that can't get in because of the people refusing to log out via AFK macros?
---
So next week and design a whole new system you got it
---
they warned people like 4 different times. and yet medium servers still have queues. that's 100% their fault
---
That’s why you bring the entire city with dude. 
---
Guards ain’t shit against ten entire 40 man raids laying waste - it’s the other players you gotta worry about.
---
*goddamn I can’t wait.

That’s the worst shit about these ques- it’s delaying the return of full on epic warfare.

Thank you very much."
---
Best will be Alchemy and Enchanting if you can do both.  But you may want a gathering profession while leveling to just sell the mats.
---
they don't want to make more servers in case people leave in later months, so they will just increase server sizes. 
---
if 10k max now, probably 12,5k or 15k? it is a better option then making even more servers.

but game is literally unplayable at rush hours atm. hope people are having fun.

watching asmongold's stream, mobs seems to be a little laggy in instances as well, but that's just me.

Yea I just noticed jumping circa 500 in 1 minute
---
Only 1 out of 3 warrior specs actually have Execute though.  They should rename the button for Fury because it functions completely differently.
---
Great thanks. Any other warlock addons you recommend?
---
Yeah sensitive, as in over-reactive to basically nothing. All I did was say you should reword that, and obviously you're feeling attacked because somebody said classic has more mature players. So therefore you flip out because you feel outnumbered. It's okay, it's just a game calm down.

If they are increasing server capacity by increasing the number of layers, it wouldn't be wise to do that before spreading the population out because once Phase 2 rolls around (and layering is removed), queues would skyrocket.
---
pushback from being attacked
---
You should not even wait more than 30 minutes in a sane world. Literally don't know how people have the patience to wait for hours on end, even if they do other stuff in the meantime. It still takes up mental space.
---
Totally understand where you’re coming from. Our server was put up on launch day. Haven’t seen a queue since, even at 5-6pm PST, which should be peak time. There might be a queue in the next few days, but I still doubt it’s as bad as other servers.
---
Yeah unfortunately for you guys theres not much you can do, in america on the otherhand, there shouldnt be anyone complaining about queues when there are open servers, people are just being to stubborn to switch
---
they were bigger in warcraft 3, so it make sense to keep it consistent and make them bigger in wow, instead of those legendary figures looking like a random player with a mid-level stuff
---
In before "They took our ~~jobs~~ slots".
---
I rolled on one of the newer servers, and tbh it seems things are a bit easier if youre a bit ahead of the curve.  I havent been going crazy with it at all (though i took yesterday off), but noticed there were a lot more people packed into all the areas of westfall today instead of just the opening areas yesterday.
---
Im hoping to at least somewhat keep up and stay ahead of *most* of the players (at least through like...30ish when theres more places to go).
---
That being said, im broke because i went and bought the 1g book to train cooking past 150, and ive stopped fishing since i wont be able to afford that one for a while :|
---
This is like marketing 101 - offer a product, when people complain, change it to a worse version, after more complaints, change it back to the original and get praised.
---
I'm totally fine with layering sticking around, given that it would mean the game has a large, active playerbase.
---
Dude I don't know what to tell you but my warrior takes a day and a half to hit with right click.  Hamstring, however, lands immediately. But in the situation where you are waiting for a quest mob to respawn, you have no rage with which to spam cast hamstring.  The difference between right click speed and hamstring speed is undeniable.
---
This is what I’ve always believed and why I’m not at all shocked by this launch and think Blizz has done everything reasonably possible for the short and long term.
---
Wait, what? They had the ability to do this all along? What was the point in waiting? It's not like they're changing server dynamics or making groups switch where they're located.
---
BC, 2 handed face smashing was in Vanilla.
---
You disgust me sir.  Go away now.

Can you please do it again? Like 5x more? https://imgur.com/a/94j81Br
---
As a Shaman... I wish I could buff everyone. Support class with no buffs :(
---
Yeah i understand that, I was just wondering what Blizzard's plan would be once it came to a point where playerbase was dropping. Surely after working on this for several years they wouldn't let it run into the ground
---
I noticed this too when i started an alt during WoD. Games have forgotten that players are actually able to figure things out by themselves.
---
this works but it doesn't make any difference how you restart the game. if you log out normally, make a coffee and log in again 5 min later and you still return to your spot in queue. You can also leave queue to check out other server queue, and not lose your spot upon return. The only thing that kicks you is actually logging in on a different server (you can stay on the char select screen without problems)
---
Firemaw
---
Stick it out. I just jumped 500 in the queue in just a minute. EU Gehennas here.
---
You think he did, but he didn't. The reality is lowlifes and filth like you offend me, which is perfectly reasonable.
---
Hmm, warrior is like the most populated class?
---
It's because if you're allowing more people to roll on a already full server and you said you're gonna remove layering in a month or whatever, then that poses a pretty big problem.
---
Bro mage is great for pvp for the kite on frost mage but druids are decent feral pvp is what i mainly played on retail for years but if i would recommend one for classic i would say mage to make money from portals and that frost kite is just strong af
---
Have fun getting in and killing no mobs
---
I was so hyped when mage quest at 10 gave me a GREEN stuff!
---
Based on the Twitter message, they could have dropped in a bunch more layers and are now working on filling those layers to capacity with people from the Q. I wouldn't panic. If the game feels dead tomorrow, maybe worry then?

Got 16k queue today on Firemaw which I think it was the worst server for queueing. Queue time is about 8-9 hours! For a 16k queue that I queued up at 1pm. If I queue up around prime time 6-7pm, it is a 25k queue.
---
I thought SS + WW worked in 1.12? Maybe not.
---
Either way, I don't mind seeing a lack of warriors, and I really won't mind seeing more warriors drop off before 60. I like instant groups.
---
Just the morning? Filthy casual
---
I was about to say.  My server had ques right away.   A lot of lag and crash.  It was not as stupidly high of numbers but there was for sure a que.
---
\*\*HUNTER WEAPON!!!!11!!\*\*
---
I don’t care about your gosh darn twitch!
---
in retail you couldn't tell how many mobs he was killing because of all the flashing lights/explosions/spell effects.
---
Because a bunch of geniuses who have taken the game from 15 million to 2 million subscriptions are predicting server fall off. What was their model Cata, WoD, BfA? They already proved how pathetic their predictions are around intial users but we have to trust their fall off models as well? Deal with it or move on. Gillete said that and lost $8 billion, what are they doing now? Kissing mens' asses and dumping the topic masculinity adds. You are the consumer you have a right to complain when wronged which is what is happening.
---
This is what I'm expecting and hoping for.
---
lol this make me laugh
---
Try updating your battle.net launcher :)
---
Haven't noticed a change.
---
Chris Metzen aka the Warchief himself, ftw!
---
Please, god....ban them. We use to call them jokes now the “entitled ones” call them “memes” ....hahahaha
---
Sure, if i ever get to log in.
---
Don’t you worry! “Thyle” the rogue will be in Westfall, storm wind, gold shire, everywhere in the months to come creating havoc.
---
You had queue issues for, what, 3 days? Ok, here’s your refund of $1.50, don’t spend it all in one place. 
---
$15 / month is incredibly cheap considering they never upped their sub cost since WoW came out. The sub should actually be a little over $20 a month if they kept up with inflation. If that’s a lot of money to you then you probably have other issues to deal with than playing WoW Classic.
---
Yeah imagine me grinding the shit out of the netherwing quest to get the mount in TBC/LK and then I came back in Cata and boom everyone has a cooler ass dragon or something.
---
What server are you on? 20:10 didn't happen on Shazzrah
---
They just announced that they are substantially raising the population capacity to help with the Ques.
---
Who has 5s just laying around??!!
---
Ya I didnt say no q but at 6 mst I was in in about 15min
---
Anal [Charge]

I don't know what level you are but I go oom real quick doing this.  
---
People keep asking me for water and I'm like sure but it will take a few mins, if you just learned a new conjure water it's only 2 per cast and it takes like 1/4 or your mana bar to cast.  If everyone in my party wants a stack of 20 water then that's gonna be like 5 minutes.
---
I’m leaning this way more and more. And if shadow priest doesn’t go well. I can just heal bot for friends I feel?
---
I've been queued since 12:00pm with a little over 5000 in the queue. It's just  after 3:00pm now and there are 2200 in the queue. At this pace, I should be playing in a couple hours, which would be great because I've been trying to get in for the last two days.
---
They should honestly gift everyone (1) free character xfer after this shit.
---
100% agreement.  Even to the firemage.  Played the same exact class/spec and quit when i went 3 weeks without seeing a single piece of cloth with crit to upgrade to.
---
But ya, I feel like people are racing to keep up with their favorite streamers...but those streamers HAVE to race because their income depends on it. 
---
For the rest of us, its really not a dire situation at all.  So many people are going to be burnt out/quit before phase 2 even hits.
---
Quick question: I rolled dwarf hunter, went to teldrassil at lvl 1, do I have to go back to ironforge to start the hunter's path quest?
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It’s your journey thru the game enjoy it as you want
---
Just dropped by 1000
---
They have openly admitted they have the capability to allow essentially an unlimited number of connections to a server - they just refuse to.

While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so
---
For some reason I read this in a redneck voice that sounded like "can we ban wainers" and I giggled out loud at work
---
Pulled an all nighter and fell asleep at 7.....got up 3 hours later. I was not prepared
---
&gt; Why does “tank” need to = tanking all content?
---
It just sucks because if they want to do anything outside of that niche, they have to respec and have gear for it. respecing was more of a pain in the ass in terms of cost, because gold was harder to come by in vanilla, and because gear farming is time consuming.
---
“Wait wait...”
---
Yeah my queue yesterday suddenly went from 5300 to 1300 then slowly trickled down again after that.  They either let 4000 additional people on or they kicked 4000 people off.
---
Nah my friend sat in queue over 8+ hours both days so far and had to go to bed before even getting to play.

If you have a decent group you will only need to toss out flash heals and power word: shield. Look up a leveling spec and that will serve you well in all situations
---
D3 is a dead game, Path Of Exile has hundreds of thousands of players and is actually supported. D3 is one of the biggest financial successes in blizzard history, despite not being the game fans wanted or even being supported.
---
Lots of people have been preparing for months with the perfect routes, professions etc to be the first 60. I am kind of excited to see the final lvl 55-60 stretch to see who ends up on top.
---
Yea or else they would break.
---
Isn’t this copy and pasted from the end-of-day update on WowHead?
---
Thanks, that helped a lot. I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to turn off config mode.
---
They could have done this two days ago to help alleviate the login issues and they decided not to...
---
Now THERE'S the 'classic experience' we're all looking for!
---
I just got rank 2 fort. Feels good buffing over ghetto forts.
---
I can't believe people are praising them haha, Like yeah, wow is great, classic is the bomb, but they've been ignoring us and telling us we're wrong for fucking years. They finally released classic while their retail game was basically burning to the ground and subs were dropping lower than ever. It's hilarious, look at that, they listened to their fans, and now they're more successful, who would've fuckin thought lmfao
---
They are absolutely banking on this not lasting long. Every step of their process shows they have zero faith in the long-term viability of this.
---
I did, thanks
---
/andmyax
---
Exactly, we are the creeps
---
Yeah I am not seeing the problem, to be honest
---
95% of players have no idea what RDP is or how to use it. The effect on queues is negligible. It's long because there's a jillion people trying to get in.
---
Wow that’s super scummy
---
Nope, Zandalar Tribe.
---
That's funny, they're about to increase realm capacity to reduce queues.
---
There are currently in american servers: 6 Low pop servers, 3 pvp, 2 pve, 1 pvp/rp, with a whooping 15 medium pop servers, a majority of which are pvp. Not full my friend, not even close
---
BfA.. I played for a few weeks a few months ago after being away from the game for a few years. It was crazy. I needed bagspace so I made a stack of 50 copper bars, sold it for 800g on the AH and had four 24 slot bags. I gained like 4 levels in the time it took to get those bars. Did this whole thing without speaking to a soul. I tried to find a guild to join but everyone I saw was from a different server group so I couldn't even join a guild.  Go to like level 90 within two weeks and I couldn't go on anymore. Only times I played with someone else was in the dungeon finder and I can count on one hand how many actual chats I have had with another person out of the \~80 dungeons I have played with that character. Even then they were so short lived because dungeons were done in 10 minutes.   
---
I can't recall a single memorable moment of that experience.  Gear didn't mean shit because most of it was heirlooms that scaled with you and the ones that weren't you outleveled in 10 minutes. Mobs and dungeons just cut through like butter with no difficulty.   If you wanted to play a zone completely you are on the next expac by the time you are down. I started in Outlands at 68 and got to 78 and I didn't even complete all the quests. Blizzard just took a massive shit on anything that took an ounce of effort.
---
OTOH, I still remember fondly the times of classic WoW, like playing on a PVP server as a decently geared paladin at level 30 in STV and a level 42 horde warrior tried to gank me. I ended up pulling that around and get the upper hand and won that fight.
---
And boom hes got my vote.
---
They could easily fill 10 more high pop servers with just the people in queue right now, holy shit.
---
All good. I hear you though my man, no worries ;)
---
Perhaps it came across wrong, but the point is most assumptions are stupid because we dont have the data, clairvoyance, or any idea what blizz will do. Generally speaking, any server that currently has high to que lock now is likely going to be as high or higher than vanilla high pop servers back in the day (going off blizz stating med pop is 2x highest vanilla pop). Nobody should really have an issue post tourist losses
---
Exactly. A lot of those items that are lower ilevel but with better secondary stats are known entities now and were known back then. I’m playing a priest, and if I were to play shadow spec I could look at certain items and go “if I can get that I know I’ll have BiS for that gear piece.” 
---
No hoping that it not only drops but also rolls the right stats with the right ilevel (which is great for games where the gear comes in fast like Diablo, not so much for WoW).
---
It’s a nice feeling to be able to look at gear in that way again in WoW.
---
I am guessing if you asked the majority of people if they would rather have area chat be lively or not have to wait in 5 hour queues you aren't going to get too many people on your side...
---
They theorized incorrectly that dungeons would be the quickest way to level
---

Im not even sure you need something to keep you logged in. Yesterday i had to make and eat food and just hope not to get dced. I was afk for 40 minutes, i know it isnt that long but It didnt even log out my char, which usually happens pretty fast.
---
Six hours? You poor poor soul. My longest was launch day and that was like... 40 minutes
---
I couldn't because I never got there. I started leveling, got out to the isles and just couldn't. It felt like a chore.
---
If going to a low pop server worked, the bitching would be unwarrented. But since people are going to new servers and finding new queues. They need to do something else
---
Well I use remote desktop to queue up. I queued up at 1pm, I am still in the queue at 8pm and will get in at 9pm. I am not even in the server.
---
Mythic+ dungeons are pretty much that, yes.
---
Not lfd/normals
---
Kirtonos, Kromcrush, etc... Most of the ones that can out after launch. Still 30 min ques at peak hours but that is reasonable in my opinion.
---
It's like another bag just dropped. Carrying capacity increased.
---
Pretty disgusting how much shit people are talking on retail. Yeah, the game you played for most of your adult life, and remained the #1 MMO during that time, was "fucking bad". Ridiculous.
---
Love you too, mate.
---
Keep fishing! You’ll be laughing with all your money
---
Who ordered the kickass fajitas?!
---
Dude there are no low pop servers
---
Leveling isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Especially if you follow a weapon guide and keep yourself with a nice weapon most of the way.
---
That's because the queue times are insane.
---
people like tho. 
---
this is the same company that said we dont want classic (intentions aside). they're no longer listening to us, they listen to shareholders and board members that dont play or enjoy the games.
---
Nah, if you got in and have been leveling semi hard (or botting) you are probably almost or at 40 by now. Mobs in STV (with like 0 competition because you're super far ahead of the crowd) drop greys that vend for a crapload, if you have skinning you just vend the skins that go for 30-60silver per stack. You can just mob grind levels and roll in gold.
---
There are a few beast grinding guides online where you can 100% grind 35-40 and get 100g for your mount.
---
I think there's a time and place for this, I mean you basically described Diablo, which I find fun, but WoW didn't start out like that. Power creep has been HUGE. Classic right now feels more like a traditional RPG, where you start to slowly grow in power, until you finally feel like a mighty adventurer. Retail, despite the stat squishes it's gone through, makes you feel like an overpowered demigod smashing through mobs like they were made out of paper.

This is for EU.

People didn't know how large of servers blizzard would create. It's still reasonable to dislike layers because of phase 2 implications. The servers should've been smaller. The playerbase will go down, but by how much?
---
I think, not 100%, but there is some pretty decent blue plate gear with defense and Mp5 from Scholomance.

You didn't have to reply to me in 2 messages.

Uninstall it from your programs and features assuming your on windows operating system. Then go to battle.net and find the download.
---
Oh this is great! I had no idea about this site. Thank you!
---
I wish I could wait in queue on one server while I play on another.
---
i just hope blizzard sees how god awful retail truly is. and not even comparing it to classic. the current version of the game is actually garbage down to it's core.
---
hopefully seeing how the community reacts to classic lets blizzard know where the flaws of retail are.
---
It just feels so nice to be helping each other, being aware of other players' existence. Just buffing and the occasional save I do when I come across people is just amazingly fun.
---
Everyone is saying great news... But is it?
---
Kinda loses the whole classic feel of community when your server consists of 30,000 different people. Reputation means jack with that many people. I guess you can really be an asshole now and well... hey.... even if 100 people dont like you... you have 29,900 others to choose from.
---
(no I dont have exact numbers.)
---
Have you considered waking up early to play? Since the servers are busy in the afternoon, I wake up around 4 am to play before work, and it's easy tagging mobs and there is never a queue. There are still enough people on that I can group up for the tougher quests. Some people hate mornings, but it may be worth considering.
---
Or they allow transfers shortly before or after Phase 2 when they go to zero layers (one layer?) if there will be huge queues still. Gives them time still to see if transfers will be needed.
---
We need another Thanos’ Snap
---
Man if we can hold this for a year we might get a single BC server. That would be my heaven.
---
But after the initial hype they likely won't even reach the new caps that they're setting
---
Ruining? Some People have jobs
---
Except it wont because of the changes lol
---
How is this ruining anything?
---
Honestly, the fact that he would never stream a game like this would actually be one of the most entertaining streams
---
It could be done. I think we need to give it a few years to see if it should be done. Personally from where I sit I'd love to see an expansion that opens up Gilnaeas and Silvermoon and other places but still be classic. And that's what's important. They haves to take care not to change the fundamentals that make Classic great. Just basically more classic content.
---
For those who might not be playing a hunter or had forgotten. You actually feed your pets and make them happy and they do more damage for you.
---
At this point it's the best solution to the serious problems Blizz has created for itself due to a severe underestimation of player count on release. They started with, what, 8 servers for all of the Americas?
---
This should already be an option. Honestly they are hurting their brand and potential profits. Non dedicated (tourists) folks are going to give up and at least a percentage of them would have stuck it out long term.
---
Shadow word pain for grabbing mobs but probably just want after that. Through up power word shield on yourself if you need it. Or smite spam until level mid 40’s and respec shadow.
---
I don't get why people leave things on mobs.
---
This is vanilla. Sell EVERYTHING. Lol.
---
Right now it seems to be the most popular. I'm only level 13, and only leveled/played a Warlock in Vanilla, but I'm quickly realizing that this is not the class for folks that don't like to put in the work. It's expensive!
---
There wasn't a queue when i logged in yesterday during peak hours
---
I am smart enough to know two things:
---
1. you should not provide a service which does not work
---
2. the problem is fixable; it is a question of numbers of servers.
---
They didn't give an exact value, they just said "significantly".
---
Nice, the Lioto Machida smoothie has done wonders to many ex diabetics

Good luck hitting 60!

For sure.  MP5 is nice while still getting geared though.  I would take it over spirit any day

Lets not forget the Economy. That many people with all the resources copied feeding into the Auction house is going to wreck the economy.
---
Taunts and threat is very different than live. You will have to wait to DPS.

In raids, it's not uncommon to wait 1-2 minutes before DPS can start.
---
Maybe you're just better than you were when vanilla first came out?
---
haha XD. i more often than not just call it DM out of habit, but i don't really care either way
---
First day I got through the queue at 2 am when I had to be up at 8. Second day I didn't get to play at all. Today I'm using remote desktop because I'm not making that mistake again.
---
You really got a good group dude, I stayed in this shit for 3 hours and it was HELL on EARTH.
---
I'd pay it.
---
This. Nailed it.
---
Fellow Gehennas queuer, I have also had several jumps in the last hour or so. Been in line for 7 hours, feels good man
---
Cool shorter ques
---
100% BS. I did an experiment during the last time walking dungeon event. I power levelled an alt from 90-&gt;110 just through timewalking. I did well over 20 dungeon runs that week. 
---
- I said hi to everyone when i joined a queue
---
- I asked how everyone was doing every time 
---
- I asked how long people were playing WoW
---
- I asked if anyone had any boss strategies or achievements they'd like to try for.
---
In *20* dungeon runs, I got 3 responses. THREE.
---
"I'm doing ok."
---
"Hopefully you 'tards are better than the last group."
---
"I'm going to chain pull make sure to keep up."
---
Its w/e server you can log onto. Me and my boys wanted to go Skeram, cause it was added couple of days before launch and showed up as a med pop server. I was able to get on it on Monday only at 1am at night. Tuesday after 5 hours in que couldn't play.  
---
So we will probably reroll on Kritonos, its still a high pop server but que lines are not as brutal it seems
---
Stupid writing . Although I could see the pass being a thing. People would buy it tho... I sure as shit would
---
Its been almost 2 days, couple people are level 44
---
Once you leave the staring zone some areas are empty. I’m talking not a soul...kinda sucks. 
---
I understand how annoying it is to fight for mobs and stuff but if I wanted to play on an empty server with no community I would just go to a private server
---
Are you insinuating raid geared pcs dont walk all over mobs in classic?
---
stallag
---
14k queue was 9 hours for my friend on Gehennas EU
---
The good ol general talk asking if anyone is on this quest. And either you or someone else might do a few quests back to get them caught up so you can do the annoying one.
---
I'm mad cus I was 5k in queue. Then I got disconnected and when I got back in I was at 13k...
---
Yup and see ya later I say!
---
Read that as "100 gold" and was like... you rich rich man!
---
I think the issue is there are A LOT of people no lifing this game. Some of them haven't stopped playing since launch and are in the mid to high 30s.
---
The issue is that if you have that many people playing non stop and not leaving the server, there is no space for other people to come in.
---
Yes because going down the exact same path that led WoW to its current retail state makes sense right? Dumbass.
---
Because it's just normal leather or linen colored with no dye!
---
I buff almost everyone I walk by and it pays off too, I get buffs in return all the time and yesterday somebody gave me a free bag because of it as well.
---
I joined que on my lunch break at work (remote desktop). Should be ready a few minutes before I'm home
---
Heh - I think it will get too long to keep track of on a piece of paper.
---
The completely unwarranted rage is so WoW of you
---
Cool starry bro.
---
Realm population seem to be switching state all the time. I believe they've changed population to reflect the current amount of players logged in.
---
By posting it about it, more people will start using it and null its effects. It’s only useful if others don’t use it.
---
LETS GO BABY. KILL THOSE QUEUES
---
yolo
---
Just leave your keybinds as they are, the cats will eventually write macros and learn meta rotations.
---
Idk I get home at peak hours every day and wait in a 30-45 min queue on a PVP server. I take that time to make dinner and do chores. Yall waiting 4+ hours is def your own fault.   
---
I wanted to join fairbanks at launch and waited and an hour and was still 13k+ in queue. Thats when I swapped to a different server and have been enjoying the game ever since. I dont think its fair to say all queues are the same. There are def better options out there for players and they keep adding new servers every day.   
---
You cant blame blizzard, this hype train was larger than even the most diehard classic fans could have predicted. For all we know Blizzard took their metrics from name reservations and expanded on that by adding more servers to fit that capacity + more. But when classic went live there was a larger boom than expected. This happened during real classic as well but for weeks.   
---
We are in day 3 right now and they're handling everything in the best way they can. If they add twice as many servers then they run the very real risk of having several dead servers in a few weeks.   
---
In the end, the decision is up to us and our friends to work together and find a server that will let us all play together. Some people refuse to do so and expect their desires to be fully met when there are millions of people wanting the same exact thing.
---
I wonder then if keeping layering around would be better? I understand the dislike behind layering, but wouldn't it be a "better" alternative to dead servers?
---
As much as I want Classic to be a success and thrive I can't imagine the game will continue to have this large of a permanent playerbase. So I feel like continuing to add new servers so rapidly might make things "worse" in the long run.
---
Of course all of this is speculation and 3 months from now we still may have a huge population. We'll have to wait and see.
---
Obviously there is no "perfect" solution that will please everyone so I understand Blizzard is going there best. That's partly why I won't leave my server. Things will improve one way or another, this is only day 2.
---
He probably raced to get that limited vendor one and didn't think it through. It may be worth that much some day, but not for a loooong time. We all out here tryin ta eat.
---
read that recent actv stock jump was from King and candy crush.
---
Man I can't wait to see how they deal with phase 2 X\_x
---
Wrong....
---
ok
---
Nog
---
There will be plenty of warriors and plenty of non warriors that will tank just fine.
---
It shouldn’t be an option, period. You payed for a service, accommodations are on the provider’s side.
---
The problem won't be fixed until everyone gets pissed and we lose 90% of the population. I'm using an arbitrary number because I don't know the real ones, but server caps are at like 150k people can be in and playing at once. The problem is even on servers that are "Full", you can still come in as a new person and make a character there. So we have 200k people trying to login and play on a single 150k capped server at once, creating queues up to 50k.
---
When enough people quit and we only have 150k people that want to play per server, it will be fine, but it's not likely to just drop exactly down to 150k. Half the people will quit in a week or two because they are tired of queues and don't care enough to come back, and then another half of the remaining people will probably quit in a month when they are tired of the gameplay. This will leave us with a bunch of low pop, 50k servers because Blizzard decided to make poor choices. This creates another, completely different issue of low pops, that all stem from them not thinking about and fixing the first problem.
---
Megaservers and sharding is the best solution, and one that most modern MMORPGS use and work well. Blizzard fucked up the coding of it in BFA, but seems like the classic sharding is working really well. They just need to expand it to every zone so they can merge and make megaservers. Instead, they intend to completely kill sharding in Phase 2 and it's going to be a mess, tbh.
---
Got into Firemaw after 9 hours and 30 or so minutes in queue. Good luck to everyone. I'm not logging off till Sunday evening.
---
Just putting in my data here. Queued at 10ish am here, currently 9000th place. Hopefully I timed it right with when I get home from work at 5pm. Yesterday I started around noon and didn't get in until after 8pm.
---
If only this were real 😂😂
---
Oh boy.. that one is a beast. What was your queue # at?
---
Those Europeans sure do love their lines, eh?
---
100% Same. I was actually a naysayer, like so many retail nerds trolling this subreddit. I was all "You think you do, you don't" "You're gonna quit within a week, you'll cry because it's too hard" Blah blah blah. 
---
I played the stress test for 2 hours and was hooked. I felt a thrill killing a level 3 boar because it actually felt like progress. I found a white axe and it was more exciting than any Epic weapon I have obtained since, well, before Legion. 
---
Now I get it, and I suspect many more will feel the same.
---
tribe hit 40 as warrior if you're still updating this
---
they just woke him up again, listening to chat he didnt even sleep 1 hour (wasnt watching so idk)
---
Gain some patience, are you serious? The options right now are either sitting in a queue for over 4 hours to spend the majority of your play time waiting for things to respawn (and cry if you get a dc), or waiting it out. Neither of which seems like a good business model and makes for a lousy launch experience where only die-hard fans who can put their life on hold can participate.
---
That's highly debatable these days. Nobody apart from those within Blizzard's management truly know how many people still play BFA. The reason is that WoD's utter failure shamed Activision into no longer disclosing this figure to their shareholders.
---
Some have tried to make estimates though, and if the more conservative estimates are accurate, then I hate to break it to you but FFXIV Shadowbringers has overtaken WoW.
---
Maybe try listening to what people are telling you instead of being a stubborn jackass. You can wait if you cant get in the server you want. If you dont   want to wait then switch to the new realms or unsub and GTFO. We dont want people who cant listen anyways. Good luck making it to 60.
---
Ave just got to 9k
---
I wouldn't say I am "happy" but the I am in the corner of if it boots me and I have to requeue I just go play something else and really don't give a damn. I am having fun, I want to play, but I don't NEED to play.

I was going to go horde but it was so toxic.
---
And...nobody cares
---
Can confirm never heard of NnM before
---
I'd like to know why 90% of the wolves I kill don't have a single paw tho.
---
On one hand, I wouldnt mind some changes. Like making ret not suck. On the other hand, the changes to make ret not suck basically just mean we are playing TBC/WotLk. And with how successful Classic already is, I imagine its basically a foregone conclusion that we get TBC/WoTLK now.
---
Phase 2 is a least a month a away, I believe multiple months away. Let's see how server pops are in a month and go from there
---
Not yet, maybe tonight
---
\*Warrior here\*
---
It's /gquit
---
They 100% will remove it. Either force queues, or force queues + offer free realm transfers.
---
Thankfully it's clear that they have the right idea. The fact that they didn't cave with 100,000+ people in queue in EU and another simiar amount in NA (It reached over 200,000 in EU today btw), until now says that this is not the typical Bli$$ard. 
---
They can slowly dial back the realm size and reduce layers. Right now, it's actually good to get people into the game because just by playing they will spread out more and thus allow fewer layers.
---
Server transfers and queues.
---
I played a paladin for like 10+ years and the ret paladins especially have been so watered down that I can't even play them anymore.  I just mistweaver monk now.
---
Buffing people is fun but when they don’t return the favor it slightly frustrates me. I really wanted that buff man
---
I totally agree! After questing through Loch Modan last night, my pally got a pair of Agi/Int gloves and I got so giddy about that upgrade for when I start healing dungeons.
---
Wow, this just got me really excited to play. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Sorting your bags: one of these habits you develop in classic because it involves lots of walking.
---
You aren't evem talking about what I am talking about. White knight harder. You said you aren't but you do.  
---
He absolutely is circumventing the afk timer whether you believe me or not.
---
Such evil.
---
Not everyone that is playing right now will make it to 60. Once server populations start to go down, they'll reduce capacity.
---
Ah this actually sounds like a legit use case. Yeah, I can see how it can be a problem in this case.
---
Oh sorry, yeah I messed that up.
---
It's 4d 20hr 50m
---
Thank god happy day! So glad they did this! 
---
^Can ^you ^imagine ^the ^grind ^to ^Grand ^Marshall/High ^Warlord ^tho? ^RIP
---
Yes. Because they didn’t promote classic wow. 
---
Want them to also bring back night elf Mohawks?
---
&gt; INT buffs weapon leveling skill chances,
---
TIL
---
so could it make sense for someone to get an INT set if they frequently change specs?
---
Interesting. So a similar approach to what Jagex did with OSRS.
---
Maybe, then I'll just go do something else. lol
---
The sole purpose of the drink! Just remember drinking loads of dew on my WoW binges. Not sure how a beverage will suddenly cause us to go straight toward a WotLK launch.
---
I think I bugged you so much you came back for more lol you live an enjoyable life my unemployed friend
---
Haha I’m pumped too!!! I just read it so it worked out to share lol
---
As a mage, I only buff the warriors, they need all the intellect they can get.
---
Isnt it 10 for riding and another 80 for the mount? Or am I thinking of 60
---
On the flip side, I actually failed being a good person.  I stood safely behind a mage last night, Candywoman, as my hunter's rifle made sure she didn't get overwhelmed in the yeti caves like I had seen so many times with others.  We made it through, she just finished, and a yeti spawned right behind me without me seeing it.  She turned to shoot it, which pulled it onto her as a mage, but then a yeti spawned behind her and went after her.  My fingers fumbled, I couldn't target the right one, my tab seemed to be miles away from my fingers.  I saw the two yetis on top of each other, so close I didn't see her go down.  When I finally got control and took them both down, she was a little tiny skeleton.  I never saw her again.
---
Just find where a bunch of non-elites are clumped up and let her practice a bit keeping all the aggro while you heal her and SW:P everything
---
&gt;And to people claiming that this will result in empty server after the  hype, keep in mind that this is offset by the removal of layers. The  whole point of layers is to combat the drop of players so in phase 2  every server that is full now should still be full then but everyone  will be on the same layer.
---
Wait till the dps specs cant tank and then feel the love
---
Shift click isn’t that hard.
---
I wish they did the reverse, increase limit then make new servers. Could help curb potentially dying servers a bit more in the long run.
---
Possibly the worst article written in human history
---
TLDR; WoW Classic will only make the quality of life in today’s World of Warcraft more noticeable and more desirable. LOL
---
Right on. Sounds like something I could get in on. May wait for a few more days though so I can play haha. Cheers
---
I just bought all my bag slots from a tailor. I felt so accomplished.
---
No I believe a lot of people in this community have deep resentment over what Blizzard has done to retail. 15 million to 2 million subscribers means you pissed millions of people off.
---
Thats whats up. I would have done that if i wasnt with a large group of friends and family. Looks like those hotfixes are gonna be really good though so grobbulus might be ok from now on.
---
Depends how sociable you want to be. I've not seen anyone talk to each other, it's just "inv" then "ty" when the quest is done. I've had no social interaction outside of discord with my mates, far less than I do on retail. Is just specific to each player, cos I don't want to be sociable on classic and I don't have to be to level up.
---
&gt;Besides BFAs raids have been amazing. Only redeeming thing about the game right now.  
---
&gt;And I'd still rather do the classic raids. Even though they aren't as good. They just feel more meaningful. I know BFA has amazing raids yet I don't want to do them. That's a sign of a bad game...
---
I couldn't agree more with this!!
---
Yeah I know but if I'm asking for a prot tank that doesn't tell me if their prot. Lots of times I got one spot left and a fury warrior messages me
---
Nothing has changed on FIremaw. Still a 8-10 hour queue of 25k people.
---
If I plan to go to bed early and get up at 4am, there is no risk of getting fucked, but potential to fuck.
---
We don’t know. If I had to guess they decided it’s more important to let people play before leaving too sour a taste in too many people’s mouths and to fix the layering issue later. I’m sure they’ll try out systems to get people to move
---
Happened to me last night, sucks man
---
Doesn't say the spec bro
---
This isn't a current screenshot? I play on Old Blanchy. It isn't even on this list and I had a very short queue on opening day and yesterday I had no wait.
---
Horde doesn't need tech support. We are the edgy millennial side duh.
---
And you step into barrens chat and see all the opposite players lmao
---
Essentially 'worlds' within a single server. One server can have 3 or 4 (or possibly more) Azeroth's on it. It was done so instead of having 1000 people in the starting zone, you would only have 200. When you log in, you're placed on a 'layer', and stay there until you log out, or group up with someone from a different layer.
---
shit is getting real
---
I agree. I learned about AHK through a private server with rerollable abilities (no snitch, not naming it but you know if you know.) lots of people used AHK to spam reroll abilities until they got op setups and it pretty much destroyed the whole point of random abilities. 
---
That being said, it’s got even less of a place on the retail game, especially when the queues are this bad. I originally commented because I felt like calling out what I perceived to be hypocritical but I’ll admit the mistake here. No hard feelings man.
---
This would also be a great option.
---
The way they are handling it now creates the worst of both worlds - ensuring new servers are relatively underpopulated, and the original ones are impossibly overpopulated. Would have been best to release with enough servers to handle the anticipated demand. The writing was on the wall, you're cutting them too much slack.
---
I see alot speculating layers wont go away but I wouldnt be surprised a free realm transfer from the most popular realms and a decent chunk of players will probably move to other realms and if there are too little that transfer I would honestly just rather see a bigger player cap and have those high pop realms be a little unstable with **alot** more people about at any given time but who knows what blizzard will do
---
But on a serious note, Blizzard. Give us back skeletons, its possible to do it without skeletons and its quite annoying to not have alot of skeletons litter the zones.
---
The google one is really good and free
---
All of them, from what I am hearing. 
---
Are you, by chance, ahead of the general level curve? While there are people in their late teens and early twenties, they have likely played far more than the average player at this point. Therefore, they will be in zones with very few players.
---
\\hug/  It's not your fault.  \\hug/
---
How many minutes was the ETA for 4400?
---
Most of us just didn't have top-of-th-food chain-computers back in the day thus making us believe vanilla was uglier than it was. 
---
Not as good as this pic because of better engine but close
---
Ghandi. The spelling you have means something very bad in Hindi.
---
Waited 7 hours today. People on my realm said I was lucky it was only 7 hours.
---
&gt; Fun leveling
---
The quests and zones were nice enough but slowly getting weaker every time you level isn't very fun to me.
---
I havent noticed layering at all, but I also play on a low pop pvp server and havent entered contested territory yet.
---
Regressing isn't how you fix that. One of the biggesr reasons (among many) the entire mmorpg genre is foundering is because, for years, the biggest potential competitors to WoW aped the old WoW formula so closely it led to the entire genre stagnating.
---
https://www.motherjones.com/food/2019/07/what-if-weve-all-been-wrong-about-what-killed-new-coke/
---
More people on servers today. What about in 2 weeks from now? Do you see my point. Temporarily allowing more people in doesn't mean that they will keep it this way and with layers.
---
Yeah, this happened to me too, actually had to check if I had equipped another weapon by accident
---
His site seems to be working? Not sure what went down?
---
Those expansions had good features, but the game was hiding its rotting core.
---
Legion was basically a fresh coat of nice paint on a house with a crumbling foundation and rotted out walls.
---
yeah, been in the queue for almost 5 hours now and still position 5400.
---
I laughed out loud, how dare you.
---
Im dumb amd cant find info on the bottom icon for level 14, would anyone care to tell me what that is?
---
warrior
---
everything else
---
druid
---
Its a small indie company though, give it time.
---
You're right. They aren't exactly hurting for players at the moment. And it would likely be to level 10, not 20.
---
Adding onto this, every server bar 1 is currently full in EU- there isn’t anywhere to switch to even if we wanted to.
---
started about an hour ago #8000 or so in queue, dropped 3000 or so in the last few mins. looks like its coming on. doesnt seem to impact queue
---
They just posted about 50 minutes ago that they are actively "dramatically" increasing the number of people who can play on a server at a time by adding layers.
---
As far as I've been able to tell, at most 3 layers have been active. If we assume each one is a vanilla wow population (3500), even a single additional layer should pretty dramatically reduce queue times this evening. 
---
TBH they've almost certainly launched more realms than they'll be able to sustain in \~6 months, but we'll see what happens. BUT, your queue woes should be significantly better tonight than they were last night.
---
i waiting since 17:45 now 21:41 and still 300in queue , wtf???? i paying for this and got nothing. blizz have to do something rly.
---
Hope you get in soon. I don't know how it will affect them either. I'm kinda just hoping for a queue that's 1-1.5 hours so I can finally play the game.
---
It's called copying and pasting. /s
---
Thanks for the info !
---
give people free game time to move
---
If only *they* remembered.
---
Believe it or not the tl;dr of this "article" is: 'classic is so bad it will make bfa  seem better by comparsion."
---
&gt;/script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
this has to be the most ghetto post on this entire sub
---
So I'm being punished for actually being ready and logging on opening night? Now I quiet literally cannot get back to my character.
---
only 298 more to go.
---
7 data seems about right
---
INVITE TO ASMON LAYER
---
For priest most definitely. On some levels the crafted wand does almost same damage as mind blast :)
---
being horde a lot are all in alliance areas. gonna head over to mulgore and see if the wolves work
---
You can without any of that, just look into your specs if your graphic chipset supports Metal. But after 2012 should be good, I run it on a MacBook Air 2017
---
Lmao /gleave
---
Yessss this is true classic
---
Last night on my druid I healed a warrior who was about to die to multiple mobs. After combat he traded me a bracers with +4 nature damage as way of saying thanks. +4 NATURE DAMAGE excited me more than any epic I've been handed in BFA. I traded him a green shield I picked up in return because it was an upgrade for him and we grouped up later.
---
Nothing in this interaction could occur in BFA. Nobody faces the risk of dying to mobs. Nobody picks up random gear that a friendly passerby could use. Nobody groups up with someone on the same journey to overcome a quest.
---
BFA brings of a lot of innovation and convenience, but the unintended consequences of these enhancements are worse than the original problem.
---
There are several Horde on the Kirintor server who would be in the top 10 or so on this list, although I guess if not strim then it doesn't matter..
---
Hoping someone will see this, do we know the release date of next content phase ?
---
But then how will I raise my rank on the server from #3 to #1?
---
Talk about account share in jokerd stream
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousArbitraryApeRiPepperonis
---
But wouldn't you agree that having both forms of the game is beneficial? I'm glad that people love classic and I want them to enjoy the games they play, but if some people enjoy retail shouldn't they have that option as well?
---
Move to a new server and enjoy playing the game. There are lists showing queue times. Find them and start having fun!
---
You're good people. I was confused though when I would get INT buff as warrior until I realized it helps with weapon mastery.
---
I am not on American servers. I am playing on Eu where everything is full
---
Even rp.
---
If you didn't care about strangers on the internet you wouldn't post about random internet strangers
---
But ew tank warrior
---
\&gt;choosing to play on the same server as assmanbald  or any other streamer
---
\&gt;now complains about scummy streamers doing scummy things
---
tip top logic there friend, im sure everyone cares about your plight.
---
As a mage I am thinking about picking up tailoring.  It is crazy to look at what I could craft and actually want something that I could make using it instead of how it is in retail where you pick a profession simply based on the one or two items of gear that you need.
---
A big part of me wants to do engineering though. All those gadgets actually have a use in classic. It is just expensive as hell to level and I don't want to be broke at level 40.
---
Yeah same
---
My brother messaged me about WCIII Remastered, but i read it as WOW Classic somehow, when i told him that he said that he was playing that as well. I had no intention of touching the game after so many years of not playing. 
---
Ill be installing it tonight...
---
And they don't for classic? lmao imagine being this delusional  
---
if you're watching netflix while raiding on retail you must be stuck on LFR or at best normal
---
got back in
---
I forgot to say in the title "aside from an RP server" and I was limiting to English. I know there was one from Russia, where was the other one?
---
Yup one person is definitely going to drastically effect these numbers.
---
Nothing could be more true... i consider myself a pretty hardcore player and even i dont have the patience to put up with this shit... even if you manage to get on the servers, good luck doing anything once inside
---
The biggest thing is world bosses in phase 2 dawg. That, and I bigger emphasis on world PvP.
---
That's not what my 8k ques said release night and last night.
---
They can play if they quit worrying about their precious names and play somewhere else
---
Well, we'll only know for sure when a new expansion is released for retail... People who played in Vanilla (up to TBC and WotLK) know a lot of what to expect, but those who joined in after Blizzard revamped the whole questing process and gave every class every possible tool in the game might not like Classic as much, once they realized nothing is balanced and the class/spec they cherish isn't half as useful (or even playable, in some cases, like Ret Pally) as it is on retail. Furthermore, high population server will certainly thrive long term, but new servers added in an attempt to help with queues might only appeal for as long as more popular servers are full and might see people transition away from them once the hype dies down, effectively "killing" them.
---
If there are 1000 people on your server and they are all in the same Zone as you, it will not feel like a 1000 person server. So I guess my point is, it doesn't matter what the population says in phase two, high medium or low, what matters is how you feel when you are on that server. And how you feel either depends on how many friends you have made and the guild you joined, or how many random people you see running by you in the world. You get to decide which one makes you feel like you are on a satisfying server.
---
But you can only control one of those.
---
To the top!
---
At least half the realms have no queue times; if you wanted to play you could.
---
Definitely not. Layering is not just about total population, it's also about zone population. 
---
Consider this example with fake numbers to explain the concept: you have a total server cap of 1000, and only one starting zone. You only want 100 people in the zone or it becomes unplayable. So you make 10 layers as players join, and each gets allocated 100 players. As players level up at different rates, they start to spread out. You end up with 1000 total players, but only 500 in the starting zone and 500 in the second zone. At this point you merge half the layers. You still have 100 players per zone, but you only have 5 layers. A couple months pass, at this point players are spread all over the world across 20 zones. Maybe one or two zones, like your capital city, go over 100, but most average 50 or so players. At this point you just turn off layering completely. At no point did you have to put your server cap over your phase 2 goal of 1000, yet you went from 10 layers to 1 because players diffused throughout the world.
---
Anyway, on night 1, only like an hour after the servers went up, I made a gnome and saw a completely full dwarf starting zone. My friend on his human invited me to his group and I immediately got moved to his layer, where the dwarf starting zone was nearly empty. He mentioned he had been grinding boars because he couldn't complete quests because the human zone was so crowded. So there was definitely heavy layering going on night 1. People just didn't see it because it actually works really well and seamlessly and Blizzard fixed most of the bugs with it from beta/stress test.
---
I wont lie to you.  Rogue was one of my favorites back then just for world pvp alone.  And I feel are the best at it since you get the upper hand most of the time on when to "start" the fight.  Thats probably why I will play a rogue again just to avoid ganks and to gank on the PvP server i play on.
---
I personally like seeing other people in the world more than once.
---
It's sort of a nirvana effect, what is the lesser of two evils in their mind. With the new server population cap being increased, I think they've already got the ball rolling in the direction that I proposed above.
---
Good post. Sorry many probably won’t see this :(
---
Adding onto the good points Ladaric made, World of Warcraft requires a much higher baseline of players to function. Raids and battlegrounds require 40+ people. There's a lot of emphasis on large groups, and competition between these large groups. In Runescape the focus is much more individualistic, which makes it easier for the game to thrive with a low population.
---
Put them on your shit list.
---
When I’m fishing I do in classic
---
Have you tried hamstring kiting? Ive been watching videos of it but can't seem to get it to work

---
Oh no. I don't mean the pvp aspect. I mean the dickheads who will slaughter all quest givers and flightmasters just to puss everyone off. It gets annoying, trust me.
---
The issue isn't how many people can fit into a server, its how slowly the queue is moving, When I queued at 1:30 EST and it is now 4:00 EST and the queue has moved from 8k to 6k, and if the rate stays the same, I'll be able to log in at 11:30 EST which means I'll play for 30 minutes before bed.
---
Are they vanilla weather effects in classic? 20h played and still not a single drop of rain :( Should they be turned on somehow?
---
But the queues are worse in euroland
---
I was in a que for over 5 hours last night, it kicked me to login screen, might wanna watch out for that
---
Skeptic in me says they will add more layers/sharding hmmm
---
When will this hotfix go live?
---
Holy shit that was a walk. Badlands too ouch.
---
Getting to level 10 and doing bear form was thrilling and so worth it, getting to level 18 and doing WC for the sick blue staff was AMAZING and we did two runs ended at level 20 handing the quests in and got cat form was like euphoria haven't had this much fun in WoW in years.
---
pick up flight paths on the way so you can just fly to xroads when you're ready to level there.
---
Yeah sorry buddy if I don’t have to wait I’m not gonna. I suggest you do the same thing until it gets better if you want to play prime time after work.
---
I agree with you, but there really are a lot of people out there who don't appreciate or respond to the same reward systems that us old-school RPG junkies do. Fortunately, I think the gaming industry is waking up to the fact that the market is diverse, and they can't get away with only investing in pay-to-win class games.
---
Not an argument fucko.

You don't have any, because you're a loser who can't accept reality.

the good ones are always in the back room, i guess
---
* Tears detected *
---
I'm looking at your original post and you explicitly say you do care about the state of the launch ("So happy").  I guess some people are so eager to white knight a problematic launch that they aren't going to waste time actually comprehending anything.
---
Companies exist to make money. We all get that. Every game developer has to put food on the table and yachts in the water. But games like World of Warcraft exist because of the creativity and passion of a group of people that enjoyed what they did and took pride in their creation. Not just to add numbers to a spreadsheet.
---
If they just offer 2-3-4-5 days gametime to people who transfer (and lock themselves into a realm for X days) they wouldn't have a problem getting people to shuffle around.
---
as long as they still remove them by phase 2 i have no problem with it. i think its potentially better than adding another 5 servers that might be dead in a year.  this way they can just turn the layers down/off when the population kind of fizzles out a bit.
---
Wait they can do that?!?? Fucking hell you sound like you got hit in the head with a brick.  I’m just sitting here with my check list of generic internet comebacks. Thanks for checking that off the list.
---
That's not how layering works. So, there is sharding, which is what you are thinking of, sort of. With layering the only time you change layers is when you you join a party this is so you will be on the same layer as your party mates. And really, if you join with people next to you, you stay on the same layer. Because layering is the whole world, you will not see people phasing in and out.
---
Sharding:
---
Goldshire 1
---
Goldshire 2
---
Goldshire 3
---
Layering:
---
Azeroth 1
---
Azeroth 2
---
Azeroth 3.

\&gt;   ~~slowly but surely they start to fill up~~ 
---

Pink Floyd IIRC
---
I think he's saying "visible" in terms of everyone can log on easily. When people see the queue size, they're more likely move servers. If everyone who reserved a character name on Whitemane/Herod had gotten in with no queue and none of them had rerolled on a lower pop server, phase 2 could be a nightmare.
---
Not everyone needs to make it to 60. I don’t know what server populations were like back then but just a hunch I don’t think they were 30000 people like the queues are right? You could have like 1000 60s and it would be more than active in the relevant zones/bgs/guilds.
---
Bonus points for those realizing that the paladin is a Toyota Prius. Hybrid class
---
Thats what i did too. Hopefully the new update helps but they all play Herod starting at 10am and i get home at 6pm ao i have zero chance of playing on Herod. Went to a new server and im having a lot of fun with new people but it sucks no one will move to this server with me. Oh well at least i get to play, plus the people of Ashkandi are awesome!
---
I think you are me.
---
Hey, after two days I already know the name of a jerk on my server that needs to be blacklisted, made a friend that it would be cool to randomly bump into again, and have names that I recognize just from questing around them in early levels. Two days is definitely enough to start a budding community.
---
That is one chonky cat.
---
As a Warrior, I am very sad that I cannot repay priests and druids who buff me with a buff of my own.
---
I would also like to know
---
Just going to say I dislike asmon as well, but I'm not on his server, nor do I watch him, so I don't really care.
---
Oh I don’t mind the waiting time that much. I’m on a server where all my friends that play wow are so I’m fine. I was just curious about the voice actors who are part of this video :)
---
At some point you can not make more layers. The have at this point to open another server. 
---
As Germanplayer i hope this will be finally a RP-Server.
---
If there weren't video I would have thought you were in the bedroom late at night.

The game has been out for almost two days. If all you've managed to do in 2 days is a level 8 hunter, then you're just very slow. People have 6 hour queues on chars they've already spent 20+ hours on.

Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. Kidding, this [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/#4b10f6707e45) sheds light on it

Thank you OP for this information!
---
It would have been equally worth it if they'd done it another way. Two different methods to arrive at realms full of life, one just involves that everyone suffers in a queue, the other involves actually barring entry to full realms.
---
Oh I am horde baby

Yeah I’m with EU. This is a bandaid fix and Blizz knows it.

2) isnt an option due to rolling a server with friends/guild.  we took blizzards advice on which server to play and the ques have been insane.

3) i stopped home for to que up.  at 2 pm there was 7k people in front of me.  so i might get on around 8-9 pm if the que moves like it did the previous two nights. i see blizzard increased the capacity of the servers so i worry i might get in before i get home in an hour and have to go back to the end of the line (which would mean another night where i cant play due to blizzards incompetence) :(

I had my non video game playing s/o do this for me and she ended up spirit walking across the continent.
---
I'm a Paladin and I'm throwing out Wisdoms and Mights left right and center :D
---
His site was overloaded, much like Blizzard servers. So he had to go to a new hosting site but it was not up at launch.
---
Started queing at 10, started playing at 4:30. Went for a smoke break, disconnected, back in que T.T fml
---
what if I use a mouse macro or something that jumps every once in a while?
---
Actually it's because alliance warlocks are handicapped In PvP
---
I believe it's because they're rolling out the hotfixes to lower queues
---
I normally find at least one or two pouches while leveling.
---
This time? Zero.
---
Thank god folks are making linen bags for free.

Whats the name of the sulfuras discord? Cant find it somehow

Green check means there is a queue

Queue still egregious - anyone know when this will take effect?

Nothing like selfless generosity by one, to be converted into cold-blooded capitalism by the next.

---
Clearly computer controlled automation, I'm not sure how this isn't cut and dry....
---
Click change realm, select your realm and try again. Promise it won't queue you and it worked for me.
---
You're looking for things to shit on for a 15 year old game though, it's a grindy MMO by all means with not much difficulty once you figure out some things. But the whole point is it's something a lot of people wanted, OSRS was a huge success.
---
League was my fulltime replacement to WoW once Cataclysm released. I loved League lots as a game and ranked was fun and it was sick to carry games but it got stressful, even more so nowadays with the community turning even more rotten.
---
Classic is not a perfect game, it's not hard, it's time consuming. But it's a fun kind of time consuming, levels feel impactful, you feel gear upgrades, the world opens up as you progress further. Sure there's endgame and it's not as challenging compared to other MMOs, but it's not all about end game in WoW. It's a social game, its built upon the ideals for everybody to cooperate. Everything is so competitive nowadays but honestly Classic WoW is a breath of fresh air from everybody trying to put each other down.
---
If I could honestly choose though, I'd love to have had a WotLK server, vanilla is a very solid compromise though. I'll enjoy the game, you can continue your bitter belittling of everybody's fun though. Honestly though your  reaching out to the minority, I wouldn't even be bothering to read Reddit and see your post  since I only ever bother with it while I'm working.
---
I only did PVP at all because my friend convinced me that's the way to go. NOW I have the options of RP or RP-PVP leveling ahahahaha. Thanks ;)
---
You underestimate people. The scripts get banned. This is going home for lunch and then remote desktop every 10 minutes so I can play for my one free hour.
---
Cooking is also weird because just the smallest amount of negligence can make it go from the single most frustrating system in the game, to a weirdly satisfying and natural progression buddy.
---
Like.. if you can get to cooking 100 before 15 or so, its pretty easy to just casually scoop up meats as you level up and keep your cooking up to date. But got damn, if you get to the Barrens and aren't 50 to cook plainstrider meat yet... you'll just literally never level cooking, you'll keep vendoring your meats, etc. etc. and then you gotta farm a gazillion plainstrider meats!!
---
Fishing makes levelling cooking an absolute breeze through the earlys tuff though, and after 100 or so there are enough recipes and you level slowly enough (compared to cooking skill) that it becomes way more manageable to keep current.
---
got to in the starting area and feel so lucky\^\^
---
I think the lame joke 'someone must have tripped over a cable and quickly plugged it back in' may actually apply here, seeing how short the downtime was :p
---
really no q on skullflame or dreadmist now?
---
Thank you for being part of this journey with us!
---
Well said. My friend groups have had exactly the same issues. The rollout has been a joke so far.
---
Layering can theoretically allow unlimited server capacity (there probably are some limits or bottlenecks, but relative to a single 2006-style realm it's a really huge number).
---
However, because it was always intended to be temporary, Blizzard put artificial caps on the number of players so people would spread out to different realms now, before they get invested in their characters or communities. I made another post explaining why layering helps even on a realm with your target population here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwowr6/maximum_realm_capacity_increased_28_august_wow/eydoy1t
---
In other words, I think they're increasing the caps now so that people who want to play now can. But they're also kicking the can of "what do we do in phase 2" down the road a bit. We may see the return of queues in phase 2 if the general population doesn't go down before then.
---
What is sarcasm? Original post? It is the original.
---
Simple answer. No
---
Yeah. but no other game could match the sense of wonder and excitement as a journey like that without knowing anything about the game. 
---
Plus at the time when taking the boat from darnassus to wetlands boat kept disappearing and dumping everyone in the water. Fun times, lol.
---
It's your own fault for staying on massively over populated servers... There are "full" servers with low queue times. Stop spamming reddit with your bullshit complaints for blizzard to "dO mOrE" when you have the power.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294747/classic-wow-server-queue-times-eu#english
---
More layering? #NotMyVanilla
---
Nor too few data
---
I posted this earlier and my post got removed. Good meme though
---
There are probably a dozen or more ultra advanced and flashy versions of what is basically chess. Yet people still play chess. Sometimes less is more and going back to a simplistic version is more appealing than lasers and explosions. They have been releasing all the old shooters from xbox lately too. Halo 2 and modern warfare. I think people liked the flashy new stuff for a while but in reality the game play was better when there were limitations
---
Sucks when your friends already picked a full server.
---
I havn't felt that cap yet and I know I am over that limit.  350 blizzard credit (I know I spent more than that in credit) perhaps they give more leeway room cause I put a $100 prepaid CC on my account a few years ago.
---
It has. Classic launched 46.67 hours ago from my comment.
---
Same here. Used him until Wrath when I switched mains. When I re-create my vanilla hunter, I'm going to be camped out at that tree around level 30 again.
---
&gt;Have a great day in classic people!
---
If you can get past the queue. I literally didn't play last night because I got randomly disconnected and then got a 5 hour queue. By the time I was able to log in I was ready for bed already. Too old to do 2 all-nighters in a row.
---
I'd be finna pull out my wand and pull a 1-8-7 on hagrid if he made me wait like that
---
ZEL! Holy shit man, it's been awhile. Been playing classic WoW lately haha. How've you been?
---
Yeah tauren aren't too popular over horde side
---
Like that will matter 😂😂😂
---
And this is why Blizzard was afraid of releasing Classic WoW.  No I am not joking.
---
Mine went from 10k queue to 8k in 1.5 hours
---
Then from 8k to 5k now within 40 mins
---
10:30am - 10k
---
12:00pm - 8k
---
12:43pm - 5.2k
---
1:12pm - 2.4k
---
Edit: herod btw
---
yeah, our group is kinda sticking it out on Pagle (2-4 hour queues average...i think one of the bigger PvE america servers).
---
BUT, last 4 days there has been a discussion about jumping.  
---
BUT! We already have people deep into tradeskills, got our guild charter going.... so the ball is rolling.  Plus, we don't want to have to jump servers again for the sake of getting bigger servers down the line.
---
No I'm just unoriginal.
---
Id say the easiest whould be AHK or AU3. Am not super knowledgeable thoug.
---
True lol, i love buffing people as i run. Sometimes when i run out of a particular buff i want i look around for someone fighting that needs heals or a shield and they tend to always buff me and say thanks afterwards. FeelsGoodMan
---
Thx for the data! I'd love to see some PvP servers.
---
Or you can start being smart and not going on a full serv when some eu serv don't have queues till 19-20h
---
Wow another screenshot of the realm list! This is the OC I come to this sub for!
---
Getting banned.
---
Wherever Sodapoppin and his mole are, I avoid.
---
Question from a new player to WoW in general, how do you cook? I learned it from a trainer, but couldn't learn any recipes cos I was too low of level. Can I just cook raw meat/fish? Or do I need to know a recipe to cook anything?
---
So sad.... I have shed a veteran Tauren warrior tear this day for young Dwarfie's incompetence...
---
I love buffing random players with my paladin it feels so good
---
There aren't enough people like you in these threads (people who think)
---
But you play wow!
---
I’ve given up playing during the evening, I wake up 4 hours before school because that’s all the time I can get .-.
---
My my my, how the turns have tabled
---
I mean many players including retail players consider BfA to be one of the worst expansions released so far. BfA lasted the shortest time for me out of any expansion (i started in wotlk). It lasted me 3 whole weeks before I quit when I usually last a couple months
---
The longjaw mud snapper market will be mine
---
Hahah u got it
---
Mages keep giving me intellect as a warrior, I just wanna let you guys know even tho it’s not great for us I appreciate the gesture.
---
You can tell that the majority of this sub hasn't played in a while. Everyone freaking out about how great the new release is, only to hate it a month later is business as usual for expansions in WoW.
---
You’ll likely end up on different layers yes but if you party up you’ll all move to the party leader’s layer
---
Hahaha. Fair enough
---
Samsung 49"?  I have that same monitor.
---
Looting the chests in high level areas, nice. Good plan, though unfortunately you’ll have to wait for the economy to catch up for you to really cash in. I don’t think I could put in the effort to do it without having some type of help to pull mobs off though.
---
This is not the solution I would have preferred. I suspect it must come from not seeing self-selected partitioning of players to new servers at rates that are needed to resolve the issues.        
---
         
---
If people are so desperate to sit in queue on a server mere days in because they simply won't move, then let them sit. Keep that pressure on until the player base conforms.      
---
        
---
But then, I've always found people being concerned  about 'half their guild already being level 15' as a barrier for moving servers to be very odd. Level 15 is not hard to do, and if your guild dynamic is important enough you either eat the queue (which they've been doing) or everyone just starts over again with only a few days of lost progress at most.
---
“I’m sorry, I thought this was America! Is this not America? I thought this was America!”
---
My favorite part of Classic so far is that I’ve been getting upgrades from GREYs because they’re identical to other gear except they have more armor. 
---
It’s awesome, also didn’t realize Warriors could wear other types of armor so that’s made my experience so far really fun. Then there’s the fact I can actually enjoy the story of Deathknell instead of feeling like I have to rush through it.
---
“Assblaster”. Nice.
---
It kind of does. I played on Smolderthorn US in retail. When they merged it with Crushridge and the other one, it really took away a sense of identity, this feeling that I was in Smolderthorn. Because I wasn't in Smolderthorn. I was in this phony version of Smolderthorn and Crushridge and the other one at the same time. The only benefit was that my high school friends actually played on Crushridge  so that was pretty cool.
---
Accurate.
---
Absolutely one of the coolest places you fly over, in the game! Got summoned a couple minutes after I got chased though, so didn't explore all that much.
---
The only thing that I've noticed in the game is the queues are still there and "Estimated time" shows "&lt; 1 minute" 100% of time.
---
Remember when they said they would never do vanilla/classic servers?
---
And when the concessions are made, the private servers will need to add capacity...
---
You can put on the queue and walk away. Just make sure your P power settings doesn't have an auto turn off/auto sleep mode set up. Though I think(could be wrong here) once on the character screen you will have X minutes to logon or get booted
---
Interesting... So it's not not a true 1.12 clone like they said. Curious what else was patched in.
---
I didn’t know about this before and just spent 45 mins watching it. That was amazing.
---
&gt;Regressing isn't how you fix that.
---
..in this case it is. New wow is *so bad* that regressing is the only way the game is going people playing again.
---
The perfect example that absolutely destroys your claim is Runescape. One of the most popular MMOs there are. They released a 2007 version after demand, it was meant to be a small project with little maintenance. Now, years later, it has slowly but steadily grown to become bigger than the main game.
---
Most people didn't "lose interest" in the old game, the playerbase steadily grew, and after about 2 years, it had overtaken the main game: http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/
---
WoW classic will be no different, and I think you know that too. There will still be players who'll continue playing the new WoW because it's what they're used to. Even if 90% of the current playerbase quits too, there will still be easily enough players to find an LFR/dungeon group. Don't worry.
---
If he only wants to pay for one subscription and is willing to switch to the EU then he should write to Blizzard support. I helped a user here on launch day that accidently bought game time for the wrong region, and they were able to refund him within a few hours, at which time he just put that money back into a different account.
---
u friend sound like a elitist dumbass jerk :\
---
You should have seen how excited I was over a wand dropping lol
---
6 month ago : "I would rather have limited sharding on the first zone if it's only 1 week than playing on a dead server"
---
1 month ago : " I would rather have layering for 2 months before phase 2 than playing on a dead server"
---
now : "I would rather have layering indefinitely than playing on a dead server"
---
Well played blizzard. You managed to make everyone accept retail technology which was one of the main reason people wanted classic in the first place : A cohesive world
---
A true poet!  😂
---
That's not the 2004 approach, that's the 2010 approach. Xrealm zones weren't implemented until Cataclysm. The 2004 approach was queues, loot lag, and server crashes.
---
Stupid NE druids too
---
Yikes the entitlement in this thread... so many selfish pricks defending their bullshit.
---
was this ytmnd content?
---
Where does it say they are adding more layers? Couldn’t they just increase each layer cap?

The daily quests thing is the biggest turn off for ever playing the current version of the game for me. I've seen so many people on this site talk about how they couldn't put in the time to do classic wow over the current game, but in reality the total time spent in classic is really flexible and more based on what you want to get out of it. As opposed to the current game where you need to do x every day or feel left behind, you can just spend that one day off getting lots of things done and then just kinda log off for a few days. Or you can do the same daily schedule, it's all up to you.
---
And that’s really a lot of what I’m saying with this article. There are things that I feel WoW has lost over the years that mainly Classic has. Namely, the “world” aspect of World of Warcraft like an emphasis on questing and exploration. Retail could benefit from some of what Classic has, but the overall quality of life the game has received over the years is something most people want nowadays.
---

---
Yes, 50g
---
This,  so much this.
---
We’d need about 8x more servers without layers
---
Warrior is the hardest class to solo level and Pally right behind it. People have been arguing with vets on these forums for months that "NOOOO WARRIORS ARE EASSSYYYY". Just reroll a Hunter or Warlock if it's your first time.
---
It's trivial to add randomly timed clicks, jumps and movements, you know...
---
This was my biggest problem with retail wow and why I quit at Cata, they dumbed down skill tree and stats on gear because "people run the same build anyways". Nah, screw that one of the things I loved most about classic and TBC was not being the same as literally every other person playing your class.
---
For sure. People haven’t played enough to be invested into servers for the most part. If the big servers queues go down people will head back.
---
Or never allow pve to pvp transfers?
---
&gt;You're looking for things to shit on for a 15 year old game though  
---
Its not like its hard to find. Everything is right there in front of you.  
---
I'm not here to shit on game, Im here to shit on people like you who lie or make delusional statements.

Cool blog i guess  
---
&gt;Sure there's endgame and it's not as challenging compared to other MMOs, but it's not all about end game in WoW  
---
For tons of people it is.  
---
&gt;It's a social game, its built upon the ideals for everybody to cooperate.   
---
Every single popular game today is built on cooperation. Dota, LoL, CSGO, Fortnite, PUBG (if playing in group).  
---
&gt;Everything is so competitive nowadays but honestly Classic WoW is a breath of fresh air from everybody trying to put each other down.  
---
Sure, but there's  raid speedrunning (lmao) and there are gonna be pvp ranks where if you step out of the line others shit on you.  
---
Its all the same.  
---
If you are tired of rotten LoL community, find like minded people and group with them. Problem solved.  
---
&gt;If I could honestly choose though, I'd love to have had a WotLK server, vanilla is a very solid compromise though  
---
I played WotLK recently. There's nothing to do but raid log (unless you pvp).  
---
&gt;I'll enjoy the game, you can continue your bitter belittling of everybody's fun though 
---
You are the one who sounds bitter for making you realize how some vanilla parts are shit, not me.  
---
I don't like it when people spout delusional shit like "aggro and looking at mana is hard".  
---
That's all.   
---
Have fun.
---
I was shocked and amused early last night as I blindly grabbed secondary professions (First Aid, Cooking, Fishing), and then... uh, didn't have enough copper left for a fishing pole.
---
More bags more money saved.
---
Holy shit. How?
---
The dailies are the timegating though.
---
...how many hours a day should a player have to put in to deserve to play the game?
---
Does wall jumping still work? I didn't even think to try it. Wonder if you can get to IF airport...
---
only Americans call it VC
---
I did it for a month straight on retail and no ban. :p
---
blissard pls
---
Wait times are effed. How many ahead of you?
---
Yikes
---
I think everything is fine the way it is right now.  Let Blizzard get back on their feet and by October we’ll be shooting the breeze in Classic.
---
Dude that's adorable....
---
Do you think this hasn’t already happened with this launch due to too few servers?
---
I won't be. Still on an original server
---
Yeah. We rolled Skeram Horde on launch, then collectively went to Sulfuras the next day. 
---
Except now that's getting full.
---
I believe there is a tukui addon but I haven’t played with adding yet so I’m not positive.
---
Nah man . #1 you can find it free if you dig hard enough. #2. You could just use questie in game (from twitch).
---
Also this: https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
It's not perfect and you can't save your place... But it's a great start. I'm lvl 20 using it so far and I like it.
---
Hunters are some of the best escape artists, survivalists in the game. Mages of more QoL utility while Hunters have more fighting utility, both are crazy cool with Engineering.
---
It’s pitbull frames and bartender for the custom hotbars
---
Helping out woulda gimped the noob even harder. They have to learn the hard way, like feeding seagulls.
---
browser tab.
---
LMFAO this is exactly how I felt getting one of my friends into Classic, I need to rewatch this show
---
This my be my favorite post thus far
---
"SMH my head"......no one should have to ever switch servers. If they should they should allow free transfers.
---
I disagree 100%
---
They've talked about it, but as of the interview with Ion published on Monday, it is unconfirmed.
---
The person is obviously manually controlling it. He is literally just moving forward/back and jumping.
---
Just give up dude.
---
Oh wow did not know this. Thanks for the heads up though I guess
---
True. Seems like a relatively minor inconvenience compared to having massively over populated realms in phase 2. They could always add a server tag to everyone's name too. Better than playing on a dead realm IMO.
---
I forgot all about that.
---
People in the comments only mad cause their fans don’t rotate.
---
Hang in there buddy, we are in 2005 here, slow down with that politically correct shit.
---
Oh. In that case, I’d just find an alternative. He made his name for himself playing Horde and only very recently started work on an alliance guide - I literally cannot imagine he has any innovative ideas in his alliance guide that aren’t in the 30+ free guides floating around out there
---
yeah, for the first 3 hours.
---
try finding a 4 other people to do redridge elited with, seriously
---
Oh, I didn't know you could "open" a skill haha. Thank you
---
Oh sorry should have specified, there is fire next to the wall you run into, you'll outheal the damage and stay logged in.
---
You’d be surprised
---
Well yeah, item level is more important because that is how your worth is measured.
---
It's a dumbass system. I hope they block any gear score addons and raid leaders and dungeon leaders have to inspect your gear because item level doesn't tell the whole story.
---
How is this true in phase 1 where levelling is the only thing occuring? Things will cool down in a months time and that's when these transfers and server merges will be necessary. Also the low pop servers are the ones they typically merge together... I don't think you thought your post through very much but yes, we're the stupid ones ;)
---
Yet, not everyone that is playing will raid at 60 anyhow. My wife and I have no plans on raising, and likely not much dungeon runs either. I expect to hit 60 with multiple characters and will only raid / dungeon if I need it for a recipe, or pattern.
---
Lol he likes blaze too, I forgot about that one. Or maybe I tried to block it out
---
No, only people who pay for that are people who feel the need to rush instead of just enjoying their time and figuring things out on their own.
---
welcome to the club, pal
---
Just spend the 5s and buy them you peasant.
---
2hander for leveling always, learn two handed swords ASAP it's 10 silver in Stormwind.
---
There are plenty of other servers with minimal/no queues.
---
In the short term, yes. In the long term, they want to minimize the number of realm merges/splits. If they create too many layers, they may have to split realms later. If they create too many realms, they may have to merge some later. Tough balancing act.
---
About 4000.
---
Yep. Now I'm wondering if I can realistically move my guy around every 20 mins while at work hahaha
---
How much the server populations go down by 6 and 12 months from now is the real question. Increasing layering like this will likely mean that a lot more people will have to leave before blizzard can turn off layering.
---
Ya fair point, I guess I just look at it as basically inconsequential if you didn't care about that particular account already.
---
Hopefully blizz can just get this all sorted properly and afk scripts can just die out naturally.  What a great problem blizz has that the biggest complaint they have is how badly people want to play their game... Now they just need to apply themselves and suture the situation instead of tacking on more bandaids
---
he is in alliance territory, he can't repair here.
---
Ive joined Deviate Delight :D
---
I guarantee you have more fun with the game than they do.
---
anyone know how druid tauren colors work? is it skin color?
---
Yea I havent seen anyone make a human hunter yet. You think they would be more popular
---
They should give everyone free month of gametime this is fucking terrible...
---
Nice! Take advantage of it while you can!
---
Art imitates real life
---
Love the guild/character names.
---
It's also dangerous for the economy to merge servers. People will not be happy if their gold is instantly worth 4x less on the AH because they got merged with a wealthier server
---
That’s 2004 numbers did you not even read the question and answer before it?
---
Newman: How many people are on servers now, as compared to a typical high-population realm on the original World of Warcraft launch day?
---
Hazzikostas: Much more. That's why we have this sense of alarm around Herod and Shazzrah. I think server capacity was something like 3,000 concurrent logins by late Classic. That number's gone up steadily over time as our hardware capacity's improved and as the world [of Azeroth] has gotten larger.
---
And he said “healthy” not FULL
---
Yeah until they click you out of queue and you have to rejoin
---
One of the very first things I did during the stress test weekend was to go looking for the fishing trainer.
---
Is this... Tauren Mills?!  Nostalgia intensifies.
---
It actually stands for DanMleef.
---
Getting mauled by a bear sounds very fitting.
---
It definitely wasn’t present in Vanilla.
---
Not true dude..... deviate delight for example has no queues ... ur being stubborn
---
If they have already implemented this, I still logged in at 4PM EST to see a queue over 10,000 on Herod. I imagine peak time isn't even 4PM, I would guess it's more like 6PM? Seems like the only way to play right now, unless you're on one of the few brand new servers, is to log on very early in the morning.
---
But what if your entire existence is just to play 1 game? What if you MUST play Classic right NOW, because it won't be here in another week or month?
---
Back online now

I've been spamming Blessings as a Paladin. Sure it's only 5 minutes but I do my best.
---
 Not in Education, Employment, or Training
---
After casting that spell so many damn times, I just gave up as there is just way too many people to give it to. When people spread out more I will go back to handing it out.
---
Right. Which is why I already conceded to you. Jesus dude.
---
&gt;You said you aren't but you do
---
Gross dude. Let people speak for themselves, don't insist on projecting your own image onto them. Sheesh. No better than, "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Dynamic respawns have been confirmed to have been in Vanilla launch
---
You wot mate
---
that's an old baby
---
FYI Figured out how to get through although issue is not resolved. BN window is there just invisible... can get mouseover text from items, had to guess where "Play" button was and it launched.
---
I don't know about Brewfest but bigger holidays like Christmas and Easter are defenitely a thing.
---
Honestly, if we have to suffer for a week and get the chance to mass-migrate, I’d consider it an acceptable situation. The only thing I fault blizzard with was the rollout during name registration. They needed to act a bit more decisively in hindsight when they saw the registration numbers. Opening one server per type was never going to be correct.
---
I’ll never forget the one time I saw someone completely misunderstand how that worked, back in Wrath. People would often post something trade along the lines of “Free X crafting, your mats, 20g for level up” or whatever. Took advantage of it a lot to make money by getting free mat to item conversions and occasionally even getting paid.
---
This one guy though, I went to trade him the mats, and he wouldn’t accept the trade. After several seconds he closes out and whispers “Need 10g for level”. Dude thought that all those other people were charging if they leveled up, instead of the obvious explanation that they were paying to level up their crafting.
---
Oh then tell me where i'm supposed to roll when every server are full right now ?
---
Hunters are super good right now because they start with an instant cast ranged attack, meaning you have an advantage on other players killing mobs for quests in starting areas.
---
Just think of al the queues we're not sitting in, and it helps the pain.
---
Can't get 10-15+ people to reroll to them when they've already started on other servers.
---
Tips for leveling a warr, your wep matters a lot, look up a guide to see the best sequence of weapons to get as you level. Stay with 2h, but keep a sword and board for dungeons as you can tank effectively without being prot.
---
how else would you make lava-cakes?
---
That's what you get for being a smoker ;)
---
Except it doesn't. 
---
You're ignoring how much longer groups of people will play together because, hey, they finally all got online at the same time!
---
What are the four buffs? I'm learning shaman atm.
---
I don’t think they’ll work but you can still install them for next time!
---
I *may* someday, just not anytime soon.
---
That, and I've already made it a goal, and I'm real close
---
Watching for adds when you're trying to back door into a quest mob. 
---
Not seeing the second mob around the corner, and running away the same path you took to get in. Only to see the respawns,  doubling doubling back to suicide as close to,  but far though away not to aggro when you repop, your target. 
---
Good times
---
Exactly. Lmao
---
It would take way to much effort to train an AI quickly to detect this. OP's call for a ban would be a one time only.
---
????????????
---
Wahhh WAHHHHHHH
---
The username says it all XD
---
To add to that your Stamina and your Primary stat is ALWAYS going to be a set amount depending on the item level. If you get an item that is Ilvl 400, then the amount of stamina is always going to be 500, no exceptions. 
---
In retail you could have items that have high stamina but lower offensive stats, or vice-verca. You could specifically target gear that had high offensive stats in order to go a more glass cannon route. This hasn't been true ingame since Wrath I believe. If I'm a ranged caster, why do I need so much stamina? Why can't I have the option of going more heavily into intellect and spell power?
---
Yeah fine. Ignoring taunt. But they also require mana to dps. They don't have a very high sustain. No damage mean no threat. 
---
Biggest problem is mana.
---
I got kicked while I was making a character, I think I took too long, and logged back in and was instantly allowed back. Maybe theres a grace period?
---
I need to get these weak flesh limbs off.
---
There is something wrong with you as well for jumping out of your chair for anything.
---
There was 2 english pvp realms, Golemagg and Shazzran. Golemagg was decided. Very later Gehennas was announced. Then Firemaw at lot later. Then only 5 hours before classic launch a couple of new servers have released. Moving to Gehennas or Firemaw would have been bad choice because these server are full as well with high queues. The leaders did not want to abandon Golemagg in the last hour so we stayed. Now everyone is everywhere.
---
Cause Vanilla is the best flavor of the rainbow
---
pee pee poo poo
---
Retail caters to casuals until it doesn't. The moment you hit max level and want to do anything beyond LFR is when the casual game stops.
---
The latter. Because we’re seeing interest and viewership of WoW Classic spike hard now even though it’s the same game from 15-years ago and most people would have stopped playing or lost interest by now if the game had remained as is for all those years. You have to take something away to make people want it again. Just weird psychology that companies take advantage of sometimes.
---
I got free bags from guildies and made them armor.  Love old school wow
---
I ... uhh.. brb....
---
Had to uninstall the app then reinstall.  Then I got to click out of the ad.
---
\hug/
---
I would say that fulfills the spirit of the rules. If it isn't you the account holder personally inputting commands they're not going to allow it.
---
When it rained I used to have to zoom all the way in and look at the ground to even play.
---
EU has received the hotfix. Have you tried the sane approach and swap to a "full" server with a smaller queue time?
---
Make Azeroth great again!
---
Centorea would be able to explain.
---
It's a bad joke, I'll move on from here.
---
Honestly, I’ve never understood the “server merges are evil” thing, because they’re honestly pretty fun IMO. It’s straight up like when the Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers got an episode together. You get this whole new set of people to befriend or make rivals with, and your dying server is suddenly rejuvenated.
---
Well I’ll be upset if I can’t play for half my sub
---
0 idea
---
Lol my Character is a shaman named MumboJumbo.
---
Based one the amount of queue, and subscription money that brought, I wouldn't call it a failure.
---
But I don't watch asmongold so there goes your foot in your mouth. Jeez
---
&gt;Moron.
---
Stay classy.
---
Like the other guy said, no dye, but also I think it's the only one you can actually buy from a vendor.  The others are all random drops.
---
The level cap is the big issue. One of the reasons I like GW2 is because it's been the same level cap but quite a bit of different content and sideways progression based on what you want to do.
---
How is getting 75 rep for killing a few mobs timegating anything?  Its not,  it's just a reward
---
I'd use it to sit on the bottom of stendel's pond while laughing at people who try to do the same.
---
In the short term, it's good because it reduces queues (although that clearly hasn't helped much so far).
---
In the long term, it could be good or bad.
---
**Good:** If a lot of players quit, each server will still have a very healthy population left over.
---
**Bad:** If a lot of players do **not** quit, realms will be extremely overcrowded when servers go from several layers to only 1. This will mean the queues get worse or they have to find some kind of other solution (like transfers).
---
Yeah, it's sad, but my post assumed already that people aren't rolling the servers that were first released, because that basically means you expect a big as queue and don't care.
---
Anal \[Dirge\]
---
I'm looking forward to doing that tonight, I only managed to tame my pet around 1 o'clock and then had to go to bed. 
---
One thing I've noticed however... my Bear's growl seems to be ineffective. I trigger it myself and I see my bear growl, but the mob won't switch aggro. Anyone know what's up? I don't think that I'm doing too much damage, because I tried stopping attacking to switch aggro once.
---
&gt;Am I taking crazy pills?
---
Nah, you're just crazy without the pills.
---
Blizzard has already stated that they closely monitor addons and will remove those that do not fit with their vision.
---
If auctioneer is being allowed, then its okay by blizzard's account.
---
Circumventing an AFK auto kick feature on the other hand is clearly not allowed. Hence you will be banned.
---
End of story. Have a nice day.
---
Haha, i would not mind it though
---
From my understanding, you can totally do this. If you log into your account from another computer while logged in on other PC, your account will disconnect and wait for you to reconnect for about a minute before you are completely kicked off the server. On the other hand, if you log out and wait a minute or two, then log in on othet PC. You will hit the queue.
---
It doesn't REALLY matter while leveling. But I usually always pick up a lvl 10 Scorpid in Durotar for rank 2 claw and then switch to a Cat in the barrens and just use that all the way to 60 (and beyond sometimes). Just be sure to look up what pets you need to tame to learn the new levels of pet abilities (Bite, claw, etc)
---
I mean, cowboys had guns. So yea?
---
have you got in yet? i'm still getting world server down
---
Classic made me realize how terrible wow has been since the introduction of LFD and Xrealm.
---
You can't understand the feeling of being literally the entire internet's fucking punching bag, or how to feels to be treated like shit in real life be cause of the fucking internet's stupid culture of "fuck anything out of the norm"
---
Bastards..
---
Don’t think so, pretty sure there is a name list that is checked on login which gives instant priority access. This would be used by QA even in production environment.
---
Are they all on a pve server?
---
Journey! Such an important part!
---
I had to RUN from SW to Wetlands to go to Darkshore. I would have NEVER done that on my main character. BfA is mainly to get from point A to point B asap.
---
It's incredible. I'm glad you're enjoying it!
---
"**People aren't swapping servers, they're just quitting... I don't think blizzard realise this** "
---
You do realize they have more information about their players than you do, you are acting like they do not run reports.
---
Well things like /say and /yell aren't, but general and trade are.
---
Trick question, the cats only care about your laptop when you're using it.
---
One doctor is causing the opiod crisis by prescribing copious amounts of pain killers?
---
One thief is causing all of the theft by stealing?
---
One oil company is causing all the carbon emissions by refining oil?
---
I want them to do an expansion off Classic that's not TBC. Like an alternate reality and divergence from Bfa. Allow people to keep their Classic toon, but also start on a new 60-70 expansion. Kinda going off that line from Bfa "wish we could go back and do it all again"
---
Still waiting to get in
---
If it were a failure there would be no queue.

Ok awesome ill try it out later, im not suppoed to smoke inside anymore but I was going to be tempted if I had to stay at my desktop
---
Some prefer it for leveling and pre-60 dungeons, but it doesn't have a taunt so it's not generally viable for end game. The exception being some niche build for PvP, but personally I'd prefer my buddy goes Retribution or Holy when we're fighting together.
---
I don’t believe it says they are adding more layers. The layers don’t control the total number of players allowed on the server. The layers simply  ‘layer’ the amount of people in one spot. If you put the entire population of the server (say it’s 1000 people per server for ease of numbers) in gold shire with 10 layers a person in each layer would see 100 other players instead of the 1000. As people spread out into the world they plan on reducing the number of layers as the crowds in high traffic areas thin out. You could have 1000 layers, it does not change the total allowed players on the server at one time just the amount each player can see at one time.
---
All my stuff is in here!
---
That doesn’t change anything. Everquest 1 still gets expansions even though Everquest 2 also exists and also gets expansions
---
Nope, nothing confirmed about the plans for classic servers beyond the release of all vanilla content. It make sense they'll move on to the expansions, but who knows.
---
Ahh I'm doing this too! I love cooking for him it makes me so happy lol.
---
WoW remade with Lumberyard as the engine would be amazing.
---
Throwing a Blessing of Wisdom on a Priest. Seeing him stop running, turn around, and chase me to give me Fortitude buff as a thankyou.   
---
And with my current levelling speed I'm beginning to recognise a few of the people I've buffed so far because they're keeping up.
---
&gt;once they realize nothing is balanced and the class/spec they cherish isn't half as useful (or even playable, in some cases, like Ret Pally)
---
There is not a single spec in the game outside of Elemental Shaman and maybe Arcane Mage that cannot raid. Just because you heard a bunch of private server clowns saying shit like this doesn't make it true. You might not have 8 Ret paladin's in a raid, but that doesn't mean they're worthless. Just because you don't stack 6 shadow priests, 5 boomkins, 5 enhancement shamans, 2 prot paladins and doesn't mean those classes do not bring stuff to the table. 
---
Retail taught players that unless you're playing the most optimum spec/talents/rotation that your class is trash. We're talking about people complaining their class is busted and unplayable when it's 4k lower on DPS than the highest class. 
---
People seem to think that in a 40man raid if you're not the very top #1 DPS that you somehow aren't contributing. This is false. 95/100 times, if you're 60, online, enchanted and available, you're probably gonna get a spot unless you're in a speedrun progression guild in Naxx.
---
The Brother Darkhood
---
It might wear off sure but I feel like this has some staying power. I guess we'll see!

Its a lot
---
Mind linking me it too?
---
Oh lawd he comin
---
Thank you! I was thinking the same thing but didn't know if that was the case.
---
I have seen these jokes so many times that they're honestly just insulting, especially because people around me see autism in the way the internet does.
---
Ya got Samwised.
---
Heres what I dont get.. I'm going to spend my gaming time ... gaming, no matter what.  I do t feel like im spending more time in classic wow vs. retail... I'm just spending my time differently.  
---
I'm also not the kind of gamer that likes to rush to end game content.  So, classic is a great fit here.
---
Also turning a decent profit to alchemists, cooks, and others.... once people have money to spend.
---
I've played on and off since WotLK and I've never really messed with macros. This sounds insane and like something I'd use! Main-ing a priest in classic.
---
What if i told you somebody else may want it and the world doesn't revolve around you...
---
begging for a feature or access to something is different then begging to ban something. Just use reddit's features as they were intended and downvote what you don't like and quit being a little bitch.
---
This is probably the best representation of why Classic WoW is just better.
---
Maybe you need to look away from your screen for 5 minutes. Take a deep breathe and drink some water, then come back.
---
As a mage I say thank you
---
what about the forsaken? do those commit the other 50 percent?
---
HEY!
---
Maybe he's just holding out for the right person! But all seriousness that Netherwing rep my wife grinded out. That thing's pretty dope.
---
Literally happened to me yesterday. Sat in queue for 4 hours, got in, had to shit, and in the time it took to shit and wipe my ass, I returned to my desk seeing that I had hit a DC wave and was then stuck in queue the rest of the night. Was AFK no more than maybe 6-7 minutes. About threw my PC out the patio door.
---
I did the bits of end game that I'll be able to do casually back in the day. I *am* excited to do them again, but they aren't going anywhere, and I regret rushing to get to the end game during vanilla. Will not repeat.
---
Same for me
---
I'm leveling one, but I'm slow, and dont care about raising as much. Just did it to help my wife with her Shaman. I've seen a few, but honestly not a lot.
---
I levelled a shaman during vanilla and it wasn't a fun experience. You'll spend more time drinking than having fun with windfury crits. Priests are also much better at 60 - although you'll be taken along as totem caster as a shaman.
---
Try printscreen dude.
---
Yes but the only reason people will stop playing right now is the queue times. If they want to be right so bad they’re willing to sabotage their own launch, then I don’t know what to say.
---
I don't think you understand this situation, it's a mental disorder, I also think that you should not make a joke about something unless you know what you are joking about, as in you know exactly how autism can affect a person, or if you yourself has that condition.
---
Saw this tonight the idiot got himself killed I laughed in classic
---
But he is on camera talking about doing it, and the evidence shows he did it. Lots of people commit murder, but when you have one of them commiting the murder on camera you shouldn't arrest them, by your logic.
---
Time to start cooking, fishing, leveling up professions. Make sure she has a full set of bags before starting out... xP
---
Can't wait for this tweet to get retconned three times over.
---
Blizzard wants them to quit. They got their 15$.
---
That's my dilemma.  I think I queued too early and now I'm gonna get afked out before I get back hom.
---
Also fresh realms in 2months for those that want to reroll.  Was very popular in Vanilla.  I did it once.  Server 2nd lvl 60 priest Chromaggus. 
---
Was fun and I didn't have connections on my first high pop server so I got to start fresh and be in the best guild on the realm Archaic.
---
Leaderboard has 5 players at level 42.
---
No wrath was when you can queue for a dungeon and not travel.
---
All autoattack (melee/shoot/throw/wand) have a 500ms activation delay for the first hit and the swing timer starts after that.
---
So it can still be used to reactively tag mobs better than nothing.
---
Why was it your node though ??
---
Second screenshot from  **Jach191**\#6803
---
Oh my god!
---
Its simply due to the people waiting. A lot of people see a 5000+ queue and drop out, giving you their spot. But when it gets down to less than 1000 no one is leaving the queue as they are determined to get in
---
News flash no potential interactions are being made in a queue.
---
I don't want to play on a low population server so I guess I will wait. You see in Azeroth!

---
Who cares if people don't log out. Im was at 400 position 1 hour ago. Now I am 350, so I guess people just stoped logging out and afk script taking place on the server...
---
If there is a God, he will make sure BL3 crashes, burns and only sells 2 copies.
---
Everyone complaining is such low iq on this sub lmao
---
For an hour? I’m not online atm, but was for about 30 minutes ago.  The server went down about an hour ago, but came back up again after just a couple of minutes.
---
I don't think it's allowed in Classic battlegrounds, and it shouldn't be.
---
It's going to be a complete shit show.
---
It divides the community, and removes a significant social aspect from the game.  Many people dislike the "slippery slope" this leads to.  Once enough people start to use this, it effectively becomes mandatory.  "Don't use it if you don't like it" doesn't work because the only thing abstaining does is grant you access to a smaller pool of players.
---
TD:DR - People don't want you to use it because it effectively means they will have to use it too.
---
I'm rich, I got like 2.5g 😎
---
Well I would disagree. I think further thinning out the players and making zones feel even emptier has a huge impact on gameplay and experience.
---
Newly Level 12 and am doing Herbalism, Alchemy and I am sitting on about 20 Silver right now.  I have a bunch of potions I had put on the AH last night when going to bed which if they all sell will mean another 10 silver or so.  
---
I also dropped 10 silver on a Herb Bag with 10 slots to go with my other six slot bags for now.  Worth it IMO while at these low levels.
---
Are these already live? We didn’t see a huge dip in server queues for Skeram.
---
I saw dry anal keano bleeds and stopped reading right there. For I have seen all i want to see
---
I’m in in around 5 hours on Fairbanks. It’s enough for a few levels a night
---
Retail is no longer salvageable though, imo. Without the old world in a serviceable state, it's just a carrot with no plot. The time jump btw old world-BC-Wrath zones alone makes it impossible treat it as a serious game with a consistent world, I feel like.
---
Saw 3 people spinning around in goldshire inn...realy LOL
---
got a phone call did ya ;D
---
He hit up Gurubashi Arena or something like that probably.
---
i don't think we will ever see voluntary transfers in classic.  the bottom line is queue times suck now because classic is the new shiny toy.  it's more realistic to believe people will stop playing classic when the next retail expansion is released or there is a new shiny console game released.
---
in 6 months i bet blizzard consolidates players to a few realms to keep the population active and closes realms all the realms we see today.
---
i would recommend to you and your guild to reroll now while the game is still fresh and you're not so invested in the character on your current realm.  you're not going to miss anything in the end game.  there will not be a race to world firsts on classic because they have already happened.
---
Goddamn back when I first played it took me 30 days of playtime to get that high
---
To be fair though I started vanilla when I was 10
---
And faster casting - I use rank 1 Smite on my priest to tag mobs since the cast time is .5 sec faster.
---
Jesus item score, really Ben???
---
IDK but when I finally get to make a character on my guild's realm, I'm going to ask for however many days back in game time that I spent in queue.
---
Pally question. I'm rolling a pally this time. Love healing dungeons while leveling. Is it easy to heal as a ret pally or hard?
---
You can be getting the "junk" nodes (floating wreckage and whatever else they're called) at all sorts of levels, they show up kinda random.  In particular as an example between 50-100 (or whenever else you want!) fish around Ratchet to find a bunch of them (unless too many others are chewing through them).
---
As a tank, those engineering explosives are very tempting
---
such statements should wait until a month after the majority of ppl hit lvl 60, and not 2 days into the hype. Classic is fine nostalgia-wise, but it's a flawed game in many aspects, it just depends if those aspects affect you I guess, as it is with many things.
---
Very nice being condescending, but the issue is that these jokes have become destructive, as in people will treat me like a retard irl because they think autism is retardation because that is what the internet thinks.
---
Seems like it’s mainly just an issue for PVP servers. That’s pretty crazy to me lol. I wouldn’t have guessed those would be so much more popular. I wonder how much of that is because of the big streamers.
---
WoW Classic tanking is the dominion of Protection Warriors and there is no real exception to that rule, which in my mind is the main reason I won’t be playing WoW Classic.
---
Don’t listen to people who tell you “just play what you want and ignore the hype” because it’s an ill informed opinion, given the circumstances. The reason (in this case) is because we all know how this ends; If WoW Classic was going to experience standard WoW game progression updates such as: class changes, xpacs, nerfs/buffs, etc. I would agree with the “play whatever you love” mantra, because most likely your unique/desirable build/class/role will eventually become viable at some point in the future. In the case of WoW Classic, that is not the case. We know where it starts and where it ends. The game fundamentally lacked abilities such as Taunt for non-warrior tanks that relegated them to some limited trash off-tanking (OT), dungeon tanking, etc. Warriors were the only serious tanks for raiding and progression Main Tanking (MT) so they always got priority in basically every situation.
---
I had a strongly geared Guardian feral Druid, Protection Paladin, and Protection Warrior from Vanilla all the way through current BFA... In Vanilla, Druid and Paladin could OT some limited aoe mob trash in raids and were ok in most dungeons if your group had the coordination to let you get aggro first. Let’s face it: that was a long time ago and most people playing the game now a days don’t seem to have the patience to let the healer regain mana before jumping into the next set of mobs, much less hold back hitting anything until the tank built enough threat/aggro on the mobs before starting DPS! I have DPS pulling in dungeons now-a-days and I have to work to get mobs off them!
---
Back in Vanilla there were some raiding guilds that had non-Warrior tanks but they were 1.) Rare, and 2.) highly coordinated (knew how to let the tank get plenty of aggro first and then carefully watched threat). There is always statistical outliers in any data set; don’t let those trick you into thinking you can roll a Prot Pally and become the MT of your guild. It will most likely not happen. You can’t even taunt mobs off group members (lol).
---
Furthermore, even if they did give non-warrior tanks a taunt and/or more tanking viability, they would still have to heavily compete for gear drops against other plate wearers. There were few pieces with any decent tank stats on them so again, I’m left saying that I spent years trying to elevate my non-warrior tanks to MT status to no avail.
---
Most guilds will not prefer a non-warrior tank over a Protection Warrior, simply due to how the game was built back then.
---
It took an expansion: Burning Crusade for other tanks to get the talents and gear required to get on more equal footing.
---
YMMV.
---
He was farming a node that I was about to and so I started walking to a different node and as soon as he finished he sprinted there to get it first. It wasn’t *my* node but it was clear I was going for it and he did it to snub me. He laughed after too so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt;Are there any possibility for a paladin to have some kind of influence over a battle?
---
Literally every character has influence over the battle what the fuck.
---
&gt; I'm sure it has the tools to be tanky (maybe even unkillable?)
---
&gt;Does the paladin have the damage throughput to force the decision and help his team win the battle?
---
A ret paladin is capable of killing players.
---
Klaththyk WoW
---
I really hope not, nothing more frustrating than someone having that big of an advantage in pvp just because they pay more.
---
I got banned from MW2 because I was curious to see how aimbots worked.  Used it in one game and that was it.  Got vac banned.  My friend did the same thing and was fine.  Still a shitty thing to do even if only out of curiosity.

Right? Less queues. Win/win

 [https://www.twitch.tv/serendepityz](https://www.twitch.tv/serendepityz) Their group is at 37 right now.
---
Server health.. Even normal medium server now are way bigger than high pop server in 2005 so even if half of the people quit playing in the future you still have a good populated server.
---
My group switched from lucifron to venoxis to dragons call to transcendence. No way I am looking at a queue every day for the next few weeks. I don't have many hours to play every day so I don't want to spend my time in a queue
---
No shit, there’s a queue. Deal with it.
---
I think your reading comprehension and debate skills both need a little work. You can train them at Bloodhoof Village
---
The population should have leveled out by the time phase 2 comes. Don't worry about it.
---
People who are racing to 60 are all idiots in my opinion. The game offers so much and isnt designed to rush it like retail is.
---
It felt like such a cheat in Wrath to jump on a lvl 55 DK.  Buuut you could only roll a DK if you had a lvl 55 toon already....
---
cant help you

not an iphone guy...
---
I'll send you nudes for 1 gold. I'm a girl gamer
---
Is he about to quit because he doesn't enjoy the game, or because he doesn't enjoy sitting in a queue for 5 hours before he's allowed to play?
---
This is actually a good idea
---
nope, just got home and loaded in without a queue
---
I’m not debating. We are on the same side.
---
What I wouldn't give for an undo button! Lol
---
This isn't "who" as in one person. This is a company with full time farmers who are also buying up gold from anyone who will sell. 
---
As of last night gold was $22/1

Issue is they aren't allowing the population to properly spread out.

www.twitter.com would be a better place to post this if you just wanna give people updates on your day
---
But then I wont see my new friends, what's your solution for that?
---
Is it really such a problem if you do not replace some items for 20 levels? The power difference between (for example) level 40 and level 60 items aren't *that* big. A level 40 2H axe is 8.3 DPS axe, 12 strength and 12 crit. A level 60 2H axe is 12.4 DPS, 14 strength and 14 crit. I would hardly call level 40 gear useless at level 60. Plus there needs to be a noticable jump in character power when you equip much better gear, or else you may as well stick with the heirloom system.

Rocking a 980ti overclocked edition which still is decent but was considering dropping 6-700 on a new one. No longer. Just gonna play classic for 6 months and then buy whatever is top of the line the month cyberpunk comes out. Feelsgoodman.
---
Second worst change in world of Warcraft behind LFG system. Leveling with terrible because it felt like you were just treading water. I just felt like I never made progress as soon as I leveled up so did enemy NPCs around me. Where's the reward in that?!
---
 Execute helps a lot with that, but really Warriors should mostly pull green mobs. Yellows are inefficient and Reds are dangerous.
---
While im loving classic... when i can get on, i didnt really want it because i knew theres a bunch of shit that is major aids to deal with. TBC or Wrath on the other hand....
---
I just hope the BFA devs realise there is a legit audience for harder/slower even if its simpler gameplay. 
---
I never wanted classic because at the end of the day its a 15 year old game, if they had taken the lessons learnt from the mistakes of the last 10 years and applied them to it or into a new MMO... I would get so hyped for it.
---
Low and dead are very different. Low will have a relatively small community that progresses through the game. Dead servers didn't kill Vael before BC.
---
I think you read my comment wrong, or you meant to reply to another person lol I specifically said getting a piece of gear *in a raid* that isn't an improvement because it's titan forged feels like garbage. 
---
Classic doesn't even have titan forging...
---
If only some other company had developed some sort of dynamic, cloud based server architecture system for online gaming that would allow Blizzard to dynamically address player fluctuations to manage all of these queue problems. That would allow Blizzard to actually focus on making games instead of trying to be server masters as well.
---
Oh well, guess it won't happen.
---
"you have a lot to learn kid" then reaffirm what I just said.
---
They will lose a lot of player base, that could still be playing, and it will be too late, because there is no possible way to see when people quit. Sure a trend will start, but that's still too late!
---
Yea, yestersay i escaped a cave somewhere in wesfall with one health point, and i never felt more alive.
---
Tried it, doesn't work.
---
I thought it was pretty common knowledge that the horde zones were underdeveloped because they were running out of time whereas the alliance was developed first and got more attention.

I dunno, i kinda think the layers going down is just a glitch.  Its been happening on Ashkandi and thats a medium pop realm that im not sure has had queues yet.
---
I do not fear a dead server because it will be a long way out until they die, and they will eventually merge it with another server if it gets too dead.
---
100% yes absolutely. You'll want to put points into wand specialisation in the discipline tree pretty early too. Basically for leveling don't touch the holy tree, you should still be able to heal alright for dungeons if you need to.
---
If only classic had more content except raids..
---
Lmao easiest trimmeds of my life.
---
Your que position is now 69420 instead of 69429
---
No, I understand. I am telling you that there is gear that you can get pretty easily outside of the raid that is better than anything that drops in a raid. The raid gear will always be a downgrade in those slots.
---
You do realize that a lot of content was removed from retail with the release of Cataclysm. ALL of that content has been put BACK with Classic, not removed.
---
Stop defending this scumbag. He's a piece of shit.  
---
I really am not better than this, thanks for thinking so though.

I made one this afternoon.

[https://discord.gg/9UU3pe](https://discord.gg/9UU3pe)
---
At this point I think most classes have had something like that at some point or another in different forms. From memory, we have 6 direct executes with Execute, Hammer of Wrath, Kill Shot, Shadow Word:Death, Shadowburn, Soul Reaper. Then there's also been/are multiple execute-esque mechanics such as Twist of Fate, Koralon's (which is a talent now), Zoldyck's, Touch of Death (kinda, was on pvp targets I think?). Couldn't think of anything for druid, shaman or dh but it wouldn't surprise me if they had something at one point or another too. Having that many executes gets really bland though, homogenisation and all that jazz
---
That’s generally the move, yeah. Although druids have a 0/30/21 spec that you can both DPS as and heal as in endgame. I think it’s the only hybrid class you can really truly be a hybrid with with one spec. Great for PvP, great for solo, and great for endgame healing.
---
I got one out of a chest. Then there was a quest in Bloodhoof that gave me ammo that I could sell for 3s. Got me one of the 5s bags.
---
My server was brand new yesterday(Thunderfury), but I'm hoping I can find someone in TB today to make some bags out of the linen I've collected. I want to live that 4 bag life.
---
So you would be fine with the purchasing of gold, mounts, and pets? That essentially goes against everything Classic is about. 
---
Paid faction transfers contributed heavily to the imbalance mess that we have now. Server transfer, even though they existed in Vanilla...need to be a bit more regulated in my opinion or else we run into the same problem of everyone just pilling onto a few mega-servers.
---
Not if you want "death by snoo snoo" via giant jaina.... jus sayin....
---
Rogues can handle that, you probably want to be out of whites though, but Rogues can solo elites. 
---
Grab some thistle tea if you wanna make it easier too.
---
Its basically like Guildwars 1.
---
Its was hella fun!
---
Except it was more like MOP, where a new set of characters are separated geographically. Have their own starting zones etc.
---
In GW1, the leveling zones, dungeons, quests and endgame was unique to the expansion, and could be played without ever interacting with the vanilla world. However once you reached a certain level, you could cross over to the other expansions to play whichever dungeon or endgame you wanted.
---
What was cool is that each class that were common between all expansions, like warriors and elementalists etc, had unique skills from each expansion and you could go to each expansion to collect them all and trully customize your playstyles with all sorts of hybrids etc.
---
Same. Except I’ll be in a queue for 10 hours and have less than 30 minutes to play 😁
---
Man these classic players are pussies. The guys who are leading right now have literally slept for 7-9 hours lmao. Anyone remember rlenk from 2012? He used to stream himself powerleveling for 120 hours straight. Shit was insane.
---
Of course you’d forget the black one!
---
I equipped grey items.
---
At level 15 I got grey shoulders.  I'm still wearing them at 20.
---
*And I fucking love it.*
---
they could have planned for that with region wide name reservation. Most newer MMO releases do this for the inevitable realm merges ahead.
---
They gave free time on vanilla launch. They also gave free realm transfers. 
---
It’s all part of the classic experience
---
What's that quest tracker?!
---
Cool. Gonna listen if it’s on iPhone podcast app or Spotify, for sure:)

Why are you lying

Jesus dude get real, anyone with an IQ above single digits would think and do this. I don’t even watch asmongold and I made a W-A-S-D macro while I went to the gym. Ban me too.

We get it. You don’t like asmongold.

Thank you kind sir! Very appreciated! I’ve also taken up ench and tailoring, this is the correct thing to do yes?

---
I tried teamviewer today but my home PC randomly decided to change password. FML.
---
That's true haha. The original comment just reminded me that when we're in traffic complaining about traffic we have to remember we're a part of traffic too.
---
At this point since they're doing this, it should be implemented as an all-in-one solution where each world descales your character to the equivalent of your current gear. 
---
Hell, you could have one character with 3 different "progression levels". Every time you're in the old world you revert to your level 60 gear, talents, etc. Outland -&gt; level 70 with TBC gear, talents, etc. and WotLK = level 80 gear talents etc.
---
I could care less
---
Man there's a macro? I've just been using Google's remote desktop app to make my character turn around every 30 - 40 minutes
---
Exactly
---
Because you cant have 3000 people in Elwynn
---
That's the best! lol
---
am i the only one who just plays other games while waiting in queue ?
---
That’s a weird way to spell “$$$$$$”
---
Only 12.5k?
---
Market got flooded on my server, so prices plummeted pretty fast. Wands for 5s are the norm now on Grobbulus.
---
Yes, i know. Lol what's your point?
---
With way less time on your hands warrior may be a pain. Mage and hunter would be much faster to level. Druid also gives you the option of going tank/healer/dps as you like and is fairly good for leveling too.
---
I want to be treated as a person not a retard, and I mean a literal retard. Have you read anything I have said.
---
Look on your map for a gravestone icon. Run to it and resurrect if you're dead.
---
Sorry to break it to you. We don't care if you play or not.
---
Why vendor below thick leather? Just not worth it to AH currently? Might it be worth it to save until later when people have more gold, or would that be mitigated by the larger supply by then/still low to zero skinning level requirement
---
This is the kind of shitposting I come to this sub for.
---
It depends on what you consider is "getting things done".
---
If your goal is endgame - then yes, you're absolutely correct on that one.
---
If your goal is to just enjoy the game as you do quests and, on some days, leveling dungeons? Then 30min-60min a day is perfectly fine, it's like slowly chipping away at a huge RPG.
---
You're the only one with the power to insult you. Don't let your disability define you. Make your weakness your strength.
---
The difficulty of the game is why I play it. Whereas in retail WoW the only challenging content is at the end game, every step of the way classic feels difficult and rewarding. 
---
Killing anything your level is difficult, killing 2-3 things at once is almost certainly a death sentence. 
---
This difficulty forces you to group up and interact with other players.
---
Is there a PDF version of this?
---
You do realize you can compare revenue to prior period where you knew subscriber information and do an analysis to get close. But hey you probably know better.
---
Yeah, ban the streamer for doing something half the playerbase is doing.
---
No I haven't heard of that and I no longer use Chrome.
---
Your parents can still give you cash at 40 and 60.
---
Nah, you'll be fine man. Vanilla is a marathon. People who sprint will be burnt out.

Nah I'm fine thanks.
---
Launch was still exactly like everyone with half a brain thought it would be.
---
I queued up for 5 hours last night and didn't even make it half way through my queue, not mad tho because I saw this coming a mile off.
---
Not really.   I did a google search and found lots of threads asking the opposite:  "Why are horde zones better?" etc
---
We’re buying my wife a laptop to play together too - it arrives on Thursday. Let me know if you figure out any tips!
---
Well given the fact leveling in retail takes a few days, no it's not like this. You also get a talent point once every 15 levels which is just...I mean, I don't know how they sat down and agreed that was a good idea. But if you can level to level 80 in a day then I guess it makes sense.
---
Thank you kind stranger but via what did you sent it :)
---
Have a great day :)
---
For me it’s not about leveling speed, it’s about not missing content. What’s great about Joanas guide is that he synthesizes quests from all the zones available at your level and combines them into a seamless path that ensures you don’t miss that one quest line in Feralas that starts from some random npc in the hall of explorers in Ironforge.
---
Dead servers won’t exist. Sure the popularity will be curbed when the retail people who started 2-3 years ago realize Classic is actually challenging but I believe classic is here to stay and there will be million of people who remain loyal to it for years to come, basically up until Wrath ends. That’s when the game became a casual shit show.
---
 No please
---
I used to do that when I RAFd myself, it was a huge pain because I was too stupid to think to use software to multi box and just used assist macros on the second account.
---
r/chonkers

---
You can defeat both of these with 6 like lines of python.
---
I'm eagerly awaiting dual faction zones where I can finally help others with my rogue since I've been getting buffed everywhere I go
---
Yeah, probably what WoW does best actually. It's not reliant on new expansions really since there's s much old content that is still relevant in this regard.
---
OP should still definitely default to 1 or 2 opening frost bolts and spend rest of his time wanding. Also elemental precision is key not to get your spells resisted.
---
He might as well learn the most efficient way to play right from the start. Going full frostbolt build is the stereotypical beginner mistake. It's what we did in 2004. You'll be sure to spend more time drinking than fighting mobs this. Leveling has been made much more efficient since people started min maxing on private servers and sharing this information online. 
---
It will be much more enjoyable for him to keep up a steady leveling pace which also turns out to be faster.
---
You mean warlock. Mages don't make potions.
---
Not me.  Yesterday I spent forever gathering the components to summon Xabraxxas in darkshore.  Slowly cleared mobs to gain access to nuts, fruits, and grains.  Made sure I had my bowl filled from the well and prepped my entry to the campfire.  I spent a few more minutes clearing my path to fire as to not pull aggro and then rushed in for the summon.  Xabraxxas appeared...and just beat the shit out of me.  Thats ok, he was level 19 and I saw two of my fellow night elfs near the camp.  Xabraxxas stayed in the camp as I made my walk back.  I whispered to my bretheren "Can you please help me, I only need a little more damage while I tank him in bear form."  No reply.  "Please, my corpse is right behind you, we can start right away."  No reply.  I resurrect and consider my options.  A round 2 fight was all I could attempt before he despawns.  I go for it...wait, hes been pulled, but they arent even on this quest?  The two night elves killed him and /lol'd at me.  No invite, no response...just sweet sweet punishment.  I look in my bag and the bow, nuts, fruit and grain is gone.  I now realize that I would have to go through all of that all over.  The rage builds, I ponder insulting them, nah that would just make em laugh in their fucking discord...walk away Kaz...walk away.  So I did, fuck that quest.
---
Engineering is the best profession for pretty much everyone, it's just a huge gold sink.

That's a relief. Seems they're getting their shit in order, albeit too late.

/u/Icecreamisaprotein Can't believe they didn't think of doing this before. Oh well.
---
/u/DevilsPajamas Definitely a contender.
---
/u/Squidwards_m0m Thanks for the heads up. Myz is #1 for me right now then. Even like the name.
---
/u/TheLastofIsh Afraid I'd only do PvP if given absolutely no other choice. I just did PVP for a year on a private server. Enjoyed it at times, but it ruined the leveling experience for a 1st timer like me. I would perform better now, of course, but I'm sure there would be a 60 Undead Priest camping me at the Arathi base camp when I first go there...again. Or there'll be 60's rolling through Duskwood and Redridge, making life miserable. Worst of all it derailed or massively delayed raids. No thank you. Just not worth it.
---
why are there ants on your log
---
I not from NA
---
Do you even read blue posts?
---
My guess is they're expecting a lot of people to have moved on down the road. Vanilla isn't for everyone, even if the hype train has been going full speed. The populations of every server will go down naturally within a month or two.
---
yup, MS is big too
---
Your friends have abandoned you to queue hell. If they were real friends they would swap with you.
---
None of the servers are dead...even the lowest ones generally have a queue of at least a few minutes.  That means they are full.  I wouldn't call that dead.
---
Targeting and following are neither spells nor abilities.
---
I did the same but then they increased server pops letting me in hours too early so I decided to just make the run to STV for the fishing book to keep from getting disconnected
---
Nah, Klathy just hella thykk!!!
---
Gotten xd lmao, epic joke
---
I think these people just want to get out of the crazy clusters of people. I have been tagging a lot of mobs and I have legit asked myself “why are you helping me?” When people running by stop to shoot an arrow or a fireball. I forget that I wouldn’t have even blinked if someone did that 13 years ago or I had in return

You don‘t.

Stinging Viper mace from WC is good. You don't have to worry about your weapon type as much until you get to lvl 30+ because that's when you start getting sword specialization. Before that, you just want to use whatever your best weapons are. Also you get a sword from the WC quest.
---
First aid is not a choice.. you can always get that.. it's seperate
---
No microtransactions other than realm transfers have been confirmed

Thank teamviewer on iPhone!

So a rolled a Dwarf Paladin and everywhere online says that Human paladins are superior. Should I re roll to human? Are the differences between them really that great? Can someone explain how crucial the advantages are?
---
TBH, server queues on my server have been, well, definitely there, but I haven't been seeing 4h queues. It's been about 1.5 - 2h per night. I would be irritated if playing was all I had to do.
---
But really, it's been a "free" couple of hours every night that means I do laundry, play with the cats, relax, and TAKE CARE of the things that I would be ignoring if I were able to log on immediately, because my self-control is not so good.
---
Good
---
I think the lowest tier mats can be safely vendored.  The middle tiers are where the real money is for people power leveling professions.  I remember way back when mageweave was more expensive than runecloth as well since all the 60s were getting runecloth regularly.
---
Agreed. If he's got the nerve to publicly shame a blizzcon attendee (who stood in a LONG line to ask a question live for hundreds of thousands to see) on stage then he should've taken a moment to publicly admit on that SAME STAGE during the vanilla announcement that he was wrong and apologize.
---
Simply being the one to announce it does not mean he is admitting that he was wrong.
---
not breaking news but ill accept your apology! thanks friend

Yea night elves are like the least popular race so the areas outside of telderrasil are 100% dead. I've gone hours without seeing a SINGLE MESSAGE IN GENERAL CHAT
---
Hey, wow costs money per month. It is 13€ here in Europe for 1 month :)
---
It just doesnt work that way in my experience. The multiboxer is always going to have his other toons with him, they are perfectly timed to attack the same target at the same time. Sure if you roll out a tank squad and treat the multi boxes like a raid boss you can down him, but I played insane amounts of classic and TBC pvp on my quest for HWL and I can tell you a multi boxer wins 90% of the time against an equal amount of enemies.

---
People will be leveling everything. Light leather is used in a lot of stuff - blacksmithing, leatherworking, tailoring, engineering. They'll want to max those skills ASAP to work on BiS items and consumables. 
---
It's a risk. With the amount of people trying to play, it might be that in a few weeks time there will be a massive glut with everyone trying to save their light leather as well. On the other hand, if not enough people are saving now, and don't want to go back and farm it come 60, then you can cash in big.
---
Like I said, I don't like risk, and I hate full bags even more, so I'd just sell low and move on to the next thing - but that's just me.

Yes my wife is not very happy with me at the moment.

also how/ whare do i put in the game time
---
&gt; Vanilla/BC/Wrath were all a long grind
---
I agree with your post in general, but just nitpicking - I feel like leveling was the heart of the game in vanilla, not really a "grind".
---
The levelcap content was an extra cherry on top, but the meat of the game was the journey to get there.
---
I think this is the biggest change between vanilla and the expansions, especially the later expansions. For obvious reasons, too, as more and more players will get to levelcap and so development needs to focus on that area of the game.
---
o shit thanks for that tip
---
As a role player I don’t really care. Less people = more community. And a bigger community that knows each other seems more friendly and open so it will attract players like that.
---
Your comments more or less reflect what I meant by tweaking.
---
You duplicate the realm in its entirety and then give people the choice of which realm they want to continue playing on. This allows friends to stick together and no loses their name or guild.
---
Started leveling Tauren Warrior got to 10 (still fun), got the itch to play my usual Troll Hunter (Damn do i just love hunter), now I'm thinking about starting UD Warlock and gnome mage... Why do I have such an alt problem...

(so are bats and rats)

Yep, sounds fair

It’s not vanilla.

How is that any different than 4 well coordinated players on ventrillo? It's basically just a guaranteed group of "friends". Personally I'd never do it because it feels like pay-to-win to me but I don't see how it's fundamentally any different.
---
This is peak WoW right here, it literally does not get better. I hope to spend as much time as possible at Tarren Mill before BG's come. Because then everyone is too focused on PVP gear, and not actually enjoying the PVP. Thanks for posting, this is so cool!
---
Psychological warfare.
---
If those numbers are real then he's really bad. Journey just got to 42 and has 36 hours played.
---
Better than yesterday, many with no queue. The top ones still have hours long queues, like 4+ hours
---
It's a decision that could easily be reversed in light of how things are going
---
Aaaand you’re just as dumb as those saying we needed 3 servers xD
---
60 with full naxx gear and a thunderfury
---
Holy crap! +3 INT?
---
They have been making millions off a shitstorm that BFA is and yet they are greedy in fixing tons of dead realms in the future.
---
Totally agree, thats a great point
---
What server are you on?
---
I've been loving hunter. I literally killed a felguard 6 levels higher than me today. As a hunter, it's basically fastest to not complete quests even and just grind mobs with autoshot and your pet, if that's what you want. Shit's crazy
---
I do, because I’m currently in the game, playing for the third day in a row with no issues. As are, from why I can tell, are a shitload of other people. 
---
So I know the game, and it’s servers are not the problem. 
---
Sounds like you are just looking for something to rage about. So go do that somewhere else, troglodyte.
---
I never heard of layering until I started WoW Monday, I always heard the term "instance"
---
I logged on from my Teamviewer at work around 2pm.  
---
No Que.  
---
I'm off work at 3:30, i expect a Que will be formed by that time.
---
Whats faster dungeon spamming with a premade from guild that are all good players or questing?
---
Yep grab a dagger.
---
its not, 3 hours queue still
---
I've got to say I still enjoy some of BfA.  As a casual player learning the heroic raids/mythic dungeon system it's still fun even if I hate having to up my ilvl every week or else get kicked immediately from 90% of pugs.
---
But trying Classic for the first time, two things stood out to me: the quests and the general chat banter.  I made a Troll Mage and was questing in Durotar, and I found myself actually enjoying the simple "kill x enemy" quests.  Something that's boring, and trivial in BfA is engaging and fun in Classic.  It felt like there was an actual small community I was helping out, and the random NPCs were people in a bigger world.  It was much better than the "Azerite WOONS" boring dialogue of BfA that I tend to end up muting/skipping.
---
And of course it was great fun talking to people while questing.  I talked at length for nearly an hour in general chat about ESO, the Hong Kong protests, 1/3/5/7 left, 2/4/6/8 right, 7/8 are whelp teams, and about peoples personal lives.  And of course I met an orc dude named BritneySpears who shouted "I JUST DOWNED 3 MONSTERS LETS GRIND BOYS" to a chorus of "HELL YEAH BROTHER"s in the chat.  It's not much, but honestly it was a blast just seeing people hang out and mess around.  Very different to the cool, calculating, overly efficient focus of BfA's chat in my experience.
---
While I'm still not sure I'll level more than 2 toons to max in classic, I've had some great first impressions.
---
My hooves all dropped really fast as well.  Just killed the lvl 13 ones nw of crossroads.
---
With layering and proper load balancing you could have as many players as you want. All the server side validation only needs to occur on each layer.
---
Man, Guild Wars was so fucking good.
---
Gosh I bet you’re miserable to work with.
---
We had alot of fun with it, we have kids now so we wouldn't be able to go until 3am doing dungeons anymore but it would be worth it if the community and even some of the spirit it started with was there.
---
I play Alliance. My name? You’ll have to find that out in-game!
---
Or they care more about their health than a meaningless record?
---
i see. Right, maybe i can dungeon/grind on main and then make questing with friend...ty for this idea.
---
Plenty of people just want to farm, though.
---
Selling accounts is another issue entirely, and is still against the rules.
---
The 1 layer is still an instance of all of Azeroth, it just happens to have a shit ton of people in the starter zones. Sharding is based on zone and when you change zones you will change to a different shard with potentially the same people that were out in the world with you from the previous zone, but no promises.
---
I’m level 16 and only got 1g.
---
I did buy some ah stuff cause people selling shit like swiftness potion recipe and savory deviate delight recipe for 10s
---
I'm honestly not sure. I'm new to this all. Should I be downloading something specifically to access pvp? Very frustrating I can't find any info about this.
---
Gotcha, makes sense. I dont watch him much, but when I have, he's seemed to me to be pro-classic, which is why I was surprised to read that.
---
Same here i read the quest and ask other players before resulting to a website for info
---
Right click on [WoW.app](https://WoW.app) \- "run in low resolution mode" - better render without scaling twice
---
Yes or they'll have alts to lvl
---
Yeah he hasn't executed this pretty good lol
---
This isn't WoW reboot, hey lets do it all over again with different expansions.... The point of this is, some of us liked WoW how it originally was without all the changes. If you like changes, play original WoW.
---
Lvl 19 and have 4 gold
---
Try using this addon
---
[https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24946-AdvancedOptionsbyMinguasBeef.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24946-AdvancedOptionsbyMinguasBeef.html)
---
Type /ao to open the options window
---
Make sure "Mouse Acceleration" is disabled and "Raw Mouse Input" is checked.
---
One key is broadcast to numerous windows is still one action.  One key making you jump 360 times over an hour isn't one action.  I've had friends banned for milling herbs with a hotkey macro clicking mill every 2s.  Good luck to you if you dont think that's detectable.
---
You don't
---
Queue. I feel like everyone on this sub should be an expert in this words spelling by now
---
I think I might just roll human. I’m only lvl 10 and the starting areas have probably cleared out a good bit by now.
---
And wow has made over 10bil....so....no.
---
find minerals is in your skillbook friend
---
Actually needing to go to the dungeon is what makes it a MMO. Big world. Dangers everywhere. 
---
Get a warlock to summon you :)
---
This is true. I only hope at some point they increase it enough just so there isn’t a que every single time I want to log in, forever. I can handle it for a little bit while things even out but if this is forever I will be forced to switch
---
Depends on level mate, friend at 30 sitting at 12ish gold and my lvl 12 ass got 33 silver.
---
It's not against the EULA, right?
---
I haven't reached my first gold yet, but after playing the AH a bit last night I think I will get there soon.  It doesn't feel too bad yet
---
Lol calm down.
---
around 2.3g as level 21 rogue. Luckily theres not many important skills to learn early on. Druids on the other hand probably hurt the most.
---
Journey (hunter), Jokerd (mage), Alkaizer (mage)
---
I'm expecting one of the mages might win at this point but who knows if they're about to crash and burn from fatigue.
---
For a while I was playing grindy games and not really enjoying it. Feeling the need to do it just to get to the fun content. With this game leveling is fun content at all levels! And then you get to some crazy shit at the end as well! Really happy this is reality :)
---
I know they are sexy, but they cant be priests and friend want Warlock also :D but yeah , they are nice :( damn smol gnomes xD
---
Mine was using his quiver as a fishing rod earlier yesterday, I was like wtf? Then realised its classic and continued using my quiver to get deviate fish.
---
There's some lvl 38 hunter out there already on EU (Hydraxian waterlords)... props :D
---
Wouldn't it be nice with shared tags?
---
I'm not familiar with Runescape, but I think we're on the same page.
---
We could also see leadership changes, infighting, and occupation of territory. All with major existing characters. There's so many different ways to go.
---
They look like little Mario Maker levels
---
What's that macro fam
---
Yeah I should have clarified
---
Is this just for EU or US as well?
---
That is pro.
---
He deleted the end where it happened, and removed the video from youtube. He knows he broke the rules.
---
Klaththy Threenshot.
---
Have you tried pushing the gryphons head down?
---
Ohh gotcha! Thanks!
---
It’s addicting.  Without being overpowering heroes we have to band together and help others out.
---
But does Luna frames and bartender work in classic (1.13.2)?
---
You're literally making fun of mentally retarded ppl. Lol
---
is that where it comes from? your tears?
---
I only appreciate this because of r/toiletpaperusa
---
I'd rather see a redoing of item looks (tho that'd piss of thousands) so it fots besser than tmog though. Personal opinion
---
It worked! Thanks &lt;3
---
That sucks but I also feel it’s a necessary evil. Without layering the queues would be even more magnitudes worse. I’d just leave for a more populated area like west fall as soon as I could.
---
When I get past the queue, the first thing I do is make 4-5 stacks of water. Takes ten minutes or so but then I don't have to worry about running out later, and I have extra to give out to Priests.
---
They have cleared out a good bit compared to launch. Goodluck!
---
I'm kinda jealous of those of you that can experience Classic for the first time.
---
Barrens on Kromcrush is unplayable due to lag. Dunno if it's similar on other servers.
---
It's not like he could if he wanted to with that queue.
---
L21, 3g.
---
Purely from saving. No professions.
---
God that’s beautiful
---
That's actually pretty cool and creative marketing
---
Just a reminder what? That you're doing nothing but karma farming?
---
oh! this sounds great, i meant exactly this. Well, thx for this info :O
---
For druid there are quests to learn how to shapeshift into a bear and a cat/lion and a seal. Other than the seal one I don't recall them being very deep. The bear is one at level 10 is literally just go and kill a bear.
---
Shaman have a quest for each of the four totem types they can drop (fire, water, earth, air). The water one is spectacularly long.
---
To me it sounds like you would very much enjoy a Tauren Shaman. The Tauren homeland is a loose analagy to north American plains tribes with a very heavy emphasis on spiritualism and nature. Also you can turn into a wolf to run places quickly. Though you can't fight as a wolf.
---
You don't push the head down ya dingus. You pull the tail up.
---
What do you think you know about the quality of my life?
---
There should be 3 factions and Night Elves and Tauren in 1 of them.
---
I can’t find the classic add on for the Onebag. Are you using the retail add on and it’s working for you?
---
Sitting in que at almost 8000 on Skerem....
---
It's safe to say that we'll never see flying even if there happens to be a classic+. A huge part of the development of cata was remaking every vanilla zone/city to make it compatible for flying. As is it is now most of the land and geography is held together by cardboard, glue, and popsicle sticks
---
Good for you! 
---
Glad you figured yourself out, enjoy leveling.
---
Right. at a certain point though, the layers themselves become the bottleneck though. Hard to say if this is the case without being a part of their engineering team. If they could have unlimited layers, they'd probably just have 1 of each type of server (PVE, PVP, RPPVP, RP).
---
The entire topic is people who are afk. 
---
How did you jump to this conclusion, you gigantic moron.
---
Yea but that doesn't let you zoom out as far as the console command did unfortunately.
---
Honestly, ASAP. 20s now is more useful than 20g in 4 months. Low leather materials won't be in demand for a very long time where it's worth holding onto some.
---
Glitch then have to requeue incoming
---
They haven't banned people for this since Vanilla came out. And, you know, also had anti afk measures that people used all the time. Just use any valid mouse emulating software, set your mouse over the enter world button, run the script to left click every 5 or so minutes and you're good to go.
---
Warlock is good different quests for different summons and mounts
---
I'm on Kurinaxx. It was a 45-min queue last night, I doubt it's going to die off anytime soon. The one I went to to avoid that queue though…
---
I have talked to more people in two days than I did in all 6 months I played bfa.
---
Welcome to vanilla wow, we hope you enjoy your stay:)
---
Huh?
---
Hello there! I never played vanilla as well, only BfA, so if you want to explore Azeroth before Cataclysm together, feel free to add me. Tauren Druid Samsara. 
---
P.S. I don't think I have any progress on that one yet due to ridiculous queues. Been leveling on RU server meanwhile, so please keep in mind that I'll be far behind for a while :)
---
Yeah cause I wasn't exaggerating for humor jeesh
---
I'm just there in my cave got my boy spawning next to me, peaceful. All of a sudden 5 people roll up and try to drive by my boy and I said not on my watch. Almost broke my keyboard from spamming
---
I agree with most of that for sure. The question is: What gameplay will get changed? TBC will most likely be a straight copy but for classic+ do you increase power level? Balance classes? change talent trees? add qol? At that point its not classic anymore and becomes its own mmo. (also gets really expensive). It will be interesting to watch.
---
Except my queue was 24k
---
Oh great tip! I assume that's just in the gameplay settings?
---
it's Free
---
I feel you though, I rolled a happy Gnome Mage - I love it so far. Are you going to spec frost to level? Just dinged 7 last night. I want to hit 10 tonight.
---
Is it just me or are there a shit tone more priests now then back in the day? I mean I'm a priest as well but I feel like every 5th player is a priest
---
Are you still there?  How is it?  I'm in the same boat.  I'm afraid to start playing because I don't want it to die.
---
yeah, but auctionator is the worst one T.T
---
Sorry if this post is not clear, my english sucks so probably i cant proper deliver my thoughts :(

I'm going Priest, and kind of leaning towards PvP but not set in stone about it. 
---
Is Herb/Alch a good money maker? Are the potions that beneficial for leveling as a Priest, and beneficial in the endgame?
---
 If not, I was considering Mining/Engi for fun and PvP, but does that get too expensive? Am I better off with two gathering professions, and respec one to engineer at 60?
---
# I've since figured out I'm a girl 
---
Do explain
---
I remember it being coined “Wrath babies” because of the dungeons
---
whats the official canon
---
Lol seriously... but when you get those clutch dodges and parries it's a rush. Have fun out there and be safe!
---
I wouldn't, I quit because BC felt like more of a grind than vanilla... I may have just been burnt out.  But the whole lore, at least on the alliance, was about the lich king and the undead... then we jump through the dark portal.  I didn't like the shift.  Coming back for Northrend was quite awesome.
---
The longer away phase 2 is the better. Most of us need many months to hit 60.
---
Retail
---
Looks like elvui
---
Same for rogues - there is no reason to deal less damage with Sinister Strike when lower ranks cost the same energy
---
You know that doesn't work right?
---
Yeah by calling them a fat fucking queer and then smacking them upside the head..
---
Give me that sweet INT buff and I will help you kill stuff.
---
Come on man that's reaching. There's been multiple of these threads and an original vanilla set isn't exactly hard to get, only the CE is.
---
Man..., I was just sitting in Brill chatting with some people in /say about how I was working on that wand, and some random Tauren came up and gave me a green Fire Wand. Feelsgoodman
---
Thank you, ladies and gentleman. Upvotes all around.
---
Hello guys I am deciding what to play between paladin and priest(bot healer role), I really like the paladin how it looks and plays but I am not sure it's the best choice since I heard it's hard to level. What should I do?
---
They will make more money off that then in diablo 4 so 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Agreed. The difference between an 18 tank handling lv 20-21 mobs and a 21 tank handling lv 20-21 mobs is not even close. The amount of threat possible, damage mitigation and hp stores are so drastically upgraded.  If there’s ever one role in a group you can manage to get over leveled, tank wins.
---
When I did it I couldn’t really wall jump but that might’ve been me doing it wrong. You can just walk up the mountains though.
---
Lmao @ copies sold in 24 hours as your new metric. I forgot we were discussing which day of the week is most ideal to launch a game on. You're the one moving goalposts here. Nice strawman as well. You've traveled so fucking far from your original retarded idea that your meaningless drabble can barely be interpreted.
---
Feel free to actually defend your original idea of shareholders approving a new project targeted at people already paying for a subscription.
---
&gt; Sorry man, the facts aren't on your side, and I'm sorry that doesn't jibe with your worldview but it's okay to not like wow and still acknowledge its insanely out sized success.
---
You have no facts here. You have logical fallacies and guesswork based on metrics that don't even correlate. You're the equivalent of a homeless man screaming about the end of time on a street corner.
---
Oh lol. I just seen people use that line on reddit a lot. Never knew where it was from.
---
1. Alan Turing?
---
2. Print Screen is your friend.
---
You got that from a joke I made making fun of a guy whining about WoW problems.  Nice logic.
---
This is correct. They changed it so that 'Full' means there is a queue. Medium is a 'healthy' amount of players, whatever that means. High means you are about to get a queue basically.
---
There were MMOs before WoW that were much harder and much more punishing. WoW is hardly “where it began.”
---
One of the Ecos Island tigers. Maybe it’s just cats or something but it looks weird to see my pet running alongside the mob (not behind), stopping, and then attacking.
---
Damn bro nice insult. Did your 4 year old brain think of it yourself or did you copy it from general chat?
---
Don't be so toxic.
---
I got two 8 slot bag drops yesterday and my guild chat was filled with congratulations, classic wow is like a new season of diablo
---
diablo 2 reforged, or reimagned. Or a real diablo 3(4) based on D2 and not the failure that is d3.
---
Hamstring bro
---
Haha I don’t care about karma at all and I haven’t seen another thread. I don’t get the saltiness, but I’m sorry I guess?
---
Nah you're right I really think there will only be exactly three servers in only one month, nice convo bye now
---
and whats your source on  "High elves changed the name of their race to blood elves when the scourge plowed through their homeland" what about Vareesa Alleria and all of Kir rin Tor ?
---
There’s 8 classes so you’ll never feel like a unicorn.
---
Why the need to boot to the drive?  Try just copying the client folder from another PC and then launching wow.exe.
---
Anyone who posts in /r/the_donald is an idiot
---
They already have one. And have for a long time. Give it a try and see.
---
Yea someone else’s comment made me realize I didn’t really think it through. That makes a lot of sense
---
Ok, so retail = wow in it's current state. I see. I definitely am curious as to what updates have lead to dissatisfaction. I come from runescape so we got a similar thing happen about 5 years ago. There's old school vs rs3. Similarly, some players left the game in it's current state to play the old school version of the game.
---
I'm very curious to see how classic decides to update and if they choose to take things in a different direction
---
My retail account went from "closed half way through WotLK" to "resubbing to check out BfA and didn't even last a single billing cycle due to WTF factor of current retail".
---
Doubt I have anything worth liquidating lol..
---
Paladins are the slowest adventure/solo class barring warriors. Druids get literally all of the kit and it’s viable enough outside of raids and hunters are top tier.
---
"get off our property."
---
Post the line where it's against the tos because this has been going on for literally decades.
---
What's your alternative suggestion?
---
Hahah this is golden
---
True.  Completely killed the open world and any wpvp.  Literally can drop down on players to kill them and farming nodes become a joke.
---
You’ll want to raid for some gear, weapon especially. Otherwise you just won’t hit for much damage. Most classes can beat you 1v1.
---
Warriors can tank and dps in pve.
---
I don't know that there will be a lot of people that want things to stay frozen  at Naxx forever, simply because there just won't be anything else to do.
---
That said, I do think the debate between TBC/WotLK and OSRS-style new content will be very interesting to watch
---
We have one person babysitting the posts, we usually don't update them as frequently when it's offtimes for that region but we do try to update them quite frequently during peak times and tweet out the updates.
---
Thank god
---
Okay......but when?
---
Dont assign gender rolls to people you dont even know or know anything about. I'd usually insult you at this point but you're obviously already dead inside. 
---
Congrats OP!
---
Meanwhile you've provided 0 metrics, my original idea is sound WoW is a wildly successful game and one of the most successful if not the most successful game of all time.
---
We don’t know what’ll happen in 1-2 years.
---
&gt; Do stats even exit in retail?   
---
Secondary stats do.  They can change the way you play a little bit here and there, and some are better than others.  It's been that way for a long damned time on retail honestly.
---
Ok, I'll try that later when I have access to my home computer
---
Wow Classic+ taking a whole new direction while keeping things simple and complicated at the same time. No dumbing the game. Just new content based on Classic. That’s a win. 
---
Blizzard should take their heads out of their pants and simply ask the community what should be added. Do some god damn polls.
---
yup. simple things like buying spell upgrades, greens and blues being much rarer, having to actually read quest text to find locations, taking on more than one mob being a calculated risk, unlocking flight paths feeling like an achievement, people actually congregating in the small towns, almost everyone grouping up with complete strangers at various times. retail leveling is so braindead and unfun.
---
Get RealMobHealth and it will give you a good approximation on the health. Classic does not gove you this info. Once you install it, any UI addon will show it
---
The sense of community is so fucking incredible. I run around and buff everyone I see, 90% of the people I buff either buff me back or stop and thank me. It’s such a kind atmosphere.
---
Playing a priest, I often run across people about to die in a fight. I’ll heal them at the last second and save their lives and they’re always so grateful. This is the type of mmo I like, where community matters.
---
You know it still works in BFA, right?
---
They changed how realms are shown on the realm list. They now reflect current players. You shouldn't have a queue unless it says 'Full'. [Source](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-realm-population-label-system/273345)
---
Thanks so much, it seems this solved my issue :)
---
about 8g at lv 18. Selling my tanking &amp; pots pays off.
---
My theory is they'll slowly re-release all of WoW. They'll stop live after the next expansion. After that, we'll just replay the entire saga completely motivated by only nostalgia.
---
Why not both 🤷‍♂️
---
Nice info man, thanks for the tips.
---
comparing the feeling of gearing up a fresh toon in a "new" game versus a well geared character that has stuff on farm. Ooh i wonder what will be more exciting. We get it, classic is good, but dont compare apples with oranges. Come back when you have MC on farm for 10 weeks
---
I'd love to see BC, and maybe even wotlk bc I like the PvP. Anything beyond that would be horrible though.
---
Fishing levels?
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Anyone care to explain a Bank Alt?
---
Same here :(
---
Classic!
---
Now there's a name I've not heard in a long, long time.
---
Needed script first D:
---
Given the way the title was worded I was expecting a Married With Children reference...I am mildly disappointed.  Lol
---
No, it wouldn't. There is no fucking economy yet. Geez you're grasping at straws here chubby.
---
In EU, I got into Golemagg this morning with no queue, around 7 am.
---
Tyvm I’ll give it a go. Is it on twitch app?
---
I found 4 before I left Northshire Abbey on my first server (Thalnos). "Transferred" to Smolderweb and found 1 after making it to Fargodeep Mine and grinding for the gold dust. Feelsbadman
---
Does it really matter. You don't even pronounce 90% of the word
---
7g, level 24 mage
---
Where does it say they increased the amount of layers? Sounds more like they just increased the realm capacity as a whole. Whatever they did the queues on skeram were much better, as I got in after about an hour and a half rather than 4 hours.
---
You're right, some did refuse to take the name.
---
So if you admit it’s a joke then you accept what I said about it being a dumb statement.  Thanks for agreeing.
---
Is this the “ you think you do..” guy?
---
on a private server i used to play on back in the bc/wrath days with some friends we took a tauren and combined as many growth effects as we could and got as big as the wall in org
---
It's a computer made for schools, I doubt it
---
Anyone that plays Fairbanks mind letting me know if we have a queue right now? Just curious as Fairbanks seemed like a middle of the pack realm in terms of population.
---
Literally. Foaming.
---
I have 15silver wootwoot
---
WAY different
---
Truth. It still is.
---
Yeah BC was a great balance. There were some really cool mounts but you had to work for them.
---
then you kill too slowly as a paladin and more respawn.  Once I realized I could fight 3 at a time as a paladin, things changed.
---
Because they will. This level of hype is totally unsustainable; summer breaks/vacation period is basically over at the end of the week, because of the shared sub there's inevitably people trying classic that will dump it for modern, the adults that are going all in right now will eventually have life/responsibilities cacth up with them, some people will just get bored, etc.
---
It's not 2005. I wouldn't suspect the Classic pop to ever be higher than it is right now.
---
It's a more deliberate, paced and challenging game that encourages player interaction and teamwork. Accomplishments to players like me feel more substantial as opposed to retail because of this. It allows the player to thoroughly enjoy the world instead of simply rushing through it or queueing for dungeons in stormwind. It rewards you for putting in effort and appreciating your journey.
---
I started BC right around the time Sunwell dropped. Leveled to 70, joined a guild that was still in Karazhan, raided every lockout, did every daily/weekly, and still just missed out on getting into Black Temple. It was a lot of time and effort to get those "welfare" epics. Sure, they are epics, but they were only good enough to get you into SSC/TK. I replaced pretty much all of it with SSK/TK gear. There were some pieces that could only be replaced in BT though.
---
I don't know, I stopped using twitch app when I quit retail. If it's not there, you can find it at willitclassic.com
---
Did the same but in AHK. Less than 10 lines of code
---
It's fine, just annoying to see the same thing over and over, it's not just you
---
What's the queue at now?
---
More reward for less work, for them.
---
This has always kind of been the race, and was a problem in classic too just approached differently. It takes a long time to create the huge amount of content just in release wow, and then a long time to create end game content.
---
If people can feasibly play through your game in a short timespan and quit the economics for a subscription based game don't work out too great.
---
You want people to have a reason to keep playing regularly for months so that sub time will roll over and so that your world will stay populated for new players.
---
That's a lot of why in classic everything is super spread out, leveling is very slow, and many quests tend to be repetitive and time consuming (go here, kill the thing for the item that has a random chance to drop, go somewhere else, repeat). Open space takes less time to design, and repeating the same couple of quest objectives over and over with replaceable specific enemies/quest items saves a ton of dev time.
---
In retail they've just figured out how to juice this even hard, for even longer, with as much or less effort.
---
Sure, we could have gotten a game that evolved in to this narrative storytelling experience that drops you at max level after you complete back to back voice acted storylines with essentially zero linear fetch and kill quests, and follows it up with dungeons and raids that mix story and challenging MMO content (which to be fair, is how many of them are now days).
---
However doing this costs more money, takes more time, and keeps players subbed for less time than shitty fucking turtle minigames.
---
&gt; 4.	⁠NO FUCKING SHARDING. 
---
And because of this you see the same people over and over again. I was omw from Teldrasil to Ironforge/SW to train weapons and I passed a gnome Mage in the mountain pass from Loch Modan to Dun Morough who was on her way to Darkshore. I /hi and she buffed me and we went our separate ways. But later after I Hearthed back I bumped into her again in Darkshore. It was neat. That’s just one example. I saw the same people several times while out adventuring, but this one felt more significant since I had bumped into her twice on 2 separate continents within about an hour between each encounter. It was neat. :)
---
It’s $15 for a month. Just try it out.
---
all at 5%
---
I was second guessing creating a rogue. Ended up doing it and I’m so glad I did.
---
This happened to me years ago. Literally witnessed some person take over my cursor as I was on my pc. Went into my steam account to look for CS:GO skins.
---
It's a shame you just said this because I thought my case might've been a fluke. I just recently reinstalled it because it has Wake on LAN capabilities, and I need to queue up remotely so I can actually play after work. Now I'm nervous... They seem to have many more security features now though.
---
Honestly yeah, waiting a bit to see if the hype is still real sounds smart. If I think I can play casually I’ll give it a shot lol.
---
Activision-Blizzard is incapable of producing a new game that was as good as Diablo 2 in 2019. The best we can hope for is D2 Reforged.
---
You should try right clicking.
---
EQ, DAOC, amongst many more... But how many were as prominent as WoW? In my mind, they set the standard and had it right with Vanilla. Thus my comment, how it all began, referring to WoW, but I cant edit post title.
---
I actually started writing one (text only, no window yet). I guess I should finish it…
---
Anyone got spare money and feeling extra generous? I'd love to play WoW but don't have the money for a sub right now...
---
I don't think they will let you keep the old character.  It is more blizz like to lose the old in able to continue on in the new game.
---
Hahahaha!!!
---
I got that from the fact you have access to the internet and probability
---
sharding is what happens in retail wow where a whole zones and cities are phased but in classic wow layering is a phase for the whole world until you log out and there are only players from the same server
---
can't wait till i'm in the barrens!
---
Is there a noob discord where I can ask questions  like how you change the quantity on the auction house? Not that I actually don't know, which I totally do... well maybe I don't...yea...
---
Just hit 1g on my 13 priest.
---
Amazing! I got Thannagma, which is like Thanos + magma?
---
Yeah redo them
---
Ugh the nostalgia
---
Who says child labor laws are still in effect? ;)
---
I agree with you man. Its a shitty thing to do. I just want to get on and chat with old friends and putz around for a little here and there but because of people gaming the system I can't.
---
Why 21+? Most countries have a less stricter drinking age....
---
yeah you have to log off normally before it will save them, disconnections also reset graphical settings etc if not logged to character select screen after setting them.
---
I think ironforge will still be the main hub, it’s close to MC, as well as menethil making it a more central hub
---
Ye thanks for the help dude
---
Red small pouch too stronk
---
Yeah i hear right clicking works really well for this problem.
---
Post on your server forum and let them be shamed
---
People used to lose their jobs cause they couldn't get off WoW vanilla, if thats casual, this country is in for Chaos!
---
ah the epic games way
---
Cooking is mostly tailored towards endgame raid consumables, don't waste time leveling it early unless you are aiming to make gold off of it, it isn't nearly as mandatory as the other guy seems to say.
---
First aid on the other hand is what you want to level along with your char, it might not seem useful to you since you can heal but trust me when I say you will thank me someday for doing it, there will be situations where you either don't have the mana to heal or can't afford to use the mana on a heal since you have other priorities , or in a pvp fight where you are fighting against another hybrid and it turns out to be a resource war, using bandage will save you a lot of time.
---
Im amazed how kind ppl are. Feels like all the toxic waste stayed on retail. I have not encou tered a single toxicboi yet, either faction.
---
No problem spasmy
---
Ooh okay that makes sense since some macros stay, thanks buddy!
---
it's a hot topic on here, but i think you're right. I haven't heard a single person in game bring it up. And the layers are still so crowded on my servers that i hadnt even though about it and certainly don't want more in my area for now

Why does this look like Soda lol
---
As people level up they will move to Ironforge. SW will be the spot in the early leveling phase of the game because its around westfall / duskwood / redridge so most people are in that area. As people hit 50+ more and more people will populate IF and then eventually it will be the core spot, just wait a bit.
---
I suspect they'll slowly bring it back down to 10000 (previous cap?) over the next month, then start cutting on layers.
---
Where it all began? Are you kidding. WoW wasn't even close to the beginning. It was the 'casual' step child of MMO's such as Everquest &amp; Ultima. And even those were after MUD's
---
I’ve had so many random friends on my friends list log in - and we’re all talking and haven’t for years, all first time logging in 4+ years holy shit the memories. Honestly even with all this server nonsense this is pretty fricken magical, you gotta admit. I’ve been chAtting with people I used to raid with regularly and stay up in vent until 4am that I haven’t talked to in years
---
World PvP hasn't started yet.
---
Yes i'll just relog next time i make new macros, thanks
---
I got an 8 slot bag, and I nearly died!
---
I remember hearing 1.7m at some point semi-recently.
---
The fun of classic aside, don't let posts like this sell you on the idea.  This post is an example of bitterness, not enjoyment.
---
Made an alt and have been mail dumping to it. Have over 100+ copper and tin, 100+ linen and getting there with wool
---
Lots of people think the earth is flat too lol. 
---
But the horde have more quests in general compared to alliance which might be why some people like it more.
---
Fake AND gay.
---
No one has the exact numbers but look at the 10q financial results activision posts every quarter to the shareholders.
---
During the height of BFA release, q3 and q4 2018 blizzard made 635m and 686m in revenue respectively. That’s all of blizzard, wow, hearthstone, overwatch, sc2, etc.
---
That’s also including the revenue from bfa box sales not just sub.
---
So if you assume half of all revenue during q3 when bfa released was from wow, so about 315m. And then assume for those 3 months in q3, half the revenue was from bfa purchases, not subs. That leaves about 157m from subs for 3 months. 
---
At $15 a sub that’s about 3.5m subs in bfas prime. Again my assumptions that wow is 50% of blizzard revenues are pure conjecture but I think fairly generous.
---
The latest quarter, q2 2019 in blizzards fiscal year, which they reported earlier this month. In this quarter they reported 384m in revenue for all of blizzard. Which is a large decline not only from the previous quarters but also year over year.
---
Now from the original 635m revenue in q3 is 50% is wow, then 315 should be from other games. Let’s just even tip the scales in wows favor and say 60% is from wow, being generous again. So that mean 254m is non wow and if the non wow revnues remains steady, then 384m from this last quarter minus 254 of non wow will equal about 130m in wow. Divided by 3 months and 15$ that’s about 2.8m current subs when being very generous with the calculations.
---
But I think it’s much less than that if you consider that wow generates a lot of cash shop revenues which is included in the total revenues, and in my calcs i’m including that as subscriptions at $15 of revenue per sub.
---
Honesty just ball parking id estimate retail has approx 1.1-2.2m subs.
---
I've got a lot of settings saved with a simple /reload, macros probably work as well.
---
There was a guy on my old server who quad boxed shamans to gladiator in burning crusade and legitimately(If you want to call it that) beat glad teams since 4x shamans (He had a paly heal as the 5th) could just instagib and one person pretty much every time they blew cooldowns. We tried quite a few strats including ways to get them seperated, had to get through the totems for that to work though and doing that meant you had to get on top of them which by that time they usually had dropped 1-2 of your team. its certainly a huge advantage to line up the burst like that where  it all hits within a couple milliseconds, trying to argue otherwise is really foolish.
---
My endgame? rofl. Making idiots like you that defend shit decisions to begin with, and now defend your moronic and proven WRONG comments? I dont need a endgame, laughing at morons is enough.

Everyone is cruising through low levels and getting a good dopamine and nostalgia fix.
---
Once they realize level 15 is 5% of the way to 60 and hit those 20-30s pre mount slumps the servers will clear out.
---
It’s the lack of quests not the zones themselves.  I could be remembering wrong but I think some of the alliance zones were made first and are uglier.
---
I’m a fan of vodka tonic with lime peelings.
---
When it’s an online single player game you have no reason to be social.
---
You realize though that the AH was added to SW well before 1.12 right?  
---
IF was just the central hub because it was there from the beginning and that's what people were used to.
---
They could give it a remastered graphics polish and update the net framework so people can play in official, ranked, cheat-secured multiplayer environments.
---
Sure, might be easier... But does it have a cool pixelated cmd window?
---
I'm provably going to be drinking Vodka infusion's. I'm trying to replicate dill/rye bread. So probably some combination of Dill, Rye, and Caraway.
---
I have seen estimated around 18k but not 100% sure where that number came from.  We know that the original realms held about 2.5k and I believe somewhere they have said the capacity is roughly 6x larger but don't know for sure.  Even with these numbers yesterday the queue for Herod was exceeding the amount of people playing on the actual server, pretty wild.
---
Modern flash drives are a lot faster than you seem to think they are.

By the way, external drives also use flash memory. Even your internal SSD uses flash.

What Rand said, the absolutely disgusting entitlement and ABSOLUTELY unrealistic expectations of some people blow my mind.  
---
Yes if it could be perfect that would be cool. Could you idiots just shut up about how little you know for ONCE though? Just be ignorant in silence? Jesus... It's not how stupid you are being that we mind, it's how you want to act like it's normal or right.  
---
Absolutely filthy. Shameful. I shudder at the thought of having to inhibit a psyche of the likes of yours. I am so sorry for you.
---
I didn't say it would be easy, or possible, just really cool
---
Read the edit, it applies to you
---
I leveled my druid as balance back in vanilla days. I was able to heal pretty well in dungeons like Mara and ST.
---
It's based on the last "insert time span here" so let's say you jump 1000 spots in 1 minute due to a power outage in the Rocky mountain area then it think a 10k queue takes 10 minutes, then takes some time to adjust
---
Happy national power rangers day by the way.
---
Yes! I love it, even 8-10 was great with just fear, such a good ability
---
Guides are useful for just this reason. It's quite often the case that you are mostly finished with one zone but not yet ready for the next. You should be prepared to move across the map into some "filler zones". 
---
Once you finish Red Ridge part 1 you still won't be able to do much in Duskwood. Instead of dying to mobs 4 times your level or grinding mobs you've already killed a bunch, you should go to Loch-Modain/Wetlands. 
---
Flight paths are relatively cheap and fast. When you get stuck somewhere, there's almost definitely some quests perfect for you in another zone. 
---
Here's a free guide if you're interested. You don't have to follow it religiously, you plug your level in a see what it suggests.

Man this hits home, I'm AFK straining my strength in OSRS while I'm leveling my undead mage

I feel loved when a mage buffs my warrior with arcain intelijents.

And another idiot sees .01% of a situation and think they've figured it all out. How do you have the hubris to think like that and not literally explode from how awful of a human you are?
---
Yes, probably, no.
---
Well geared paladins are fun in PvP but your damage is mostly burst with team support.

Don't

Mages are not good tanks imo
---
TBC minus flying is my personal perfect iteration of WoW.

They could also make the Shattrath tour skippable...

I completely agree

Not at all. I'd rather take fortitude, but it seems priests avoid running around in the wild.

Thats a cool guide, i havent seen that one. I am fine with just going zone to zone but there are just a few zones that i dont want to miss. i m fine with hopping around and going to other zones. Orrrr just farming mobs for mats :P

Unless your specifically trying to not use addons/guides I don't see a point.

He's definitely being rude, but there's a reason it's called "gender dysphoria", it's not some crackpot theory that the vast majority of humans, including transgendered humans, are born as either a boy or girl.

I imagine you play a druid right? Does it help the fantasy?
---
Honestly, I would love to see TBC servers released but separate from Classic.  Give plays a *free* option to transfer or a PAID option to copy over their character from Classic.  The transfer would be permanent and one way, while the copy would allow you to retain your level 60 on Classic while also progressing that character in TBC.
---
It's not any more disruptive than 1 guy with 4 guild friends who he can call if he needs to PVP someone or kill something

Both factions are perfectly fine; there may be some variability server to server but in general I'm sure you will find what you are looking for. Choose the race you like the best in terms of lore/aesthetic.
---
Why? It was only available once you were 70 anyways. They would of course have to change things like Alcatraz, or ogrilla, and other small regions. It didnt affect most of tbc.
---
Yep, they should filter out some of the bad features and/or let the player base vote on what gets added/removed (kinda like how Old School Runescape did it).
---
I agree the feeling playing the games is completely different. I’m not sure how modern wow can replicate this, but the feeling of having a chore list every week is definitely something that philosophically feels bad for the gameplay. Classic feels so much better. I like BFA for raiding, but Classic just feels fun where BFA is a chore list and annoyances Everytime I log in then fun when a new raid comes out for maybe a month when I’m in the raid, then annoying grind for pointless reason just to keep up for where I’m supposed to be for the next raid. The problem isn’t the grind it’s what you get for the grind and what your doing in the grind. Classic feels like exploring and grinding and rewarding progression. But whatever I’ve rambled. I hope classic popularity influences gameplay design choices in the next expansions
---

I had this issue and found out that I had to take out the contents of the unzipped folder and place them in Addons for them to work.
---
My opinions about your core foundations list:  
---
1. Definitely graphical improvements.  I want purty.  
---
2. Definitely more armor, better armor, cooler armor, sexy armor  
---
3. I think "ridiculous" mounts need to be hard to get, then I'm okay with them.  
---
4.  Add any QOL that doesn't directly change play patterns.  LFG is a no no.  Removing weapon skill is a good one, since its a nuisance that barely effects gameplay except to screw you over while leveling.  
---
5. Just leave it I think.  If they add content then they can use those zones and give them purpose.  
---
6.  Flying Mounts, personally.  Or maybe if they added flying mounts they would be really limited, like only fly for 20 seconds before going on cooldown.  And class homogenization, obviously.  Huge no-no thats long past the point of no return.
---
Hi fellow Fairbanksian! I have no bags yet (only level 6),but I'll be on the lookout for yours in the AH!
---
You're not on the classic version of the game is my guess.
---
I had the opposite, layer crashed and logged in to find myself swarmed by mobs that were dead on the previous layer.
---
Ahhh, I see. Thank you very much!
---
I surely hope that people forgot about it. I hope this kind of thing never becomes normalized in the community.
---
even the gnolls in elwynn have shit drop rates lol
---
I got a 6 slot bag off my very first mob I killed, and yes I jumped up and yelled a bit.
---
I'll try that :)
---
You're right.  People use TSM to batch their posting and if you don't run your operations for 24/48 hours all of those drop off.  Major market players sitting in the queue prevented them from using that time to repost auctions and so we get the graph.  If you could log in to both retail and classic, you'd likely see no discrepancy.  It might even have risen as people did their AH chores.
---
To be fair, we don't really have any useful ones to return, and the ones we do get, we learn at higher level than other classes get theirs.  :(
---
People should play classic casually. 
---
But not that casually.
---
Thanks for the reassurance!  Sounds like Horde is for me
---
These types of posts are okay to compare the two but I’m of the opinion we shouldn’t trash the retail product to show how much we are enjoying Classic.
---
You are looking back in retrospect.   The systems in place today are QoL changes from the systems that needed changes back in the day.  The same systems we asked for mostly and welcomed when we didn’t know there’d be a WoW classic.
---
BFA should be considered an evolution of the app we started back in ‘04 - Good and Bad .Most games don’t endure this long.
---
Respect your elders!
---
I been drinking a lot of water and smoking wax tbh.
---
Even so, shouldn't I have the addons option on my character select screen? I had the option on retail before installing anything
---
Wow. They look like 007 Goldeneye characters. hah
---
I just jumped 1500 spots in queue and then my queue has been stuck at 53rd in line. Who knows.

Who said that? There's no way.

Maybe ret Paladin
---
This was so much fun
---
First day I looted red AND blue back to back on a lvl 1 NE on the Stalagg realm... next day my friend and I moved to Sulfuras cuz queues were so long. The sacrifices we must make to actually play the game are costly my friends. Keep up the hype tho!
---
Those troggs in Loch Modan... I have no intention of pulling more than 1. 2 maybe if my stun is off cooldown and my mana pool is looking good but good grief, those troggs respawn so quickly. I wind up getting half way through killing one before 3 more respawn. I died like 6 times, got in a group with a poor gnome who faired worst than me before I called it a night. I think I have to kill 20 troggs total and I only had 2 down
---
Totally agree... Amazing what you can get done when you physically can not play WoW.
---
You do understand that 1.9 is when AHs were linked for cities, the same patch as AQ event.
---
Tea.
---
Specifically, vendors sell the small brown leather pouch for 5s. 
---
Throw those dudes charging 10s to the wolves
---
No, it's not easy to make gold in Retail.
---
in retail you can get revered with the base factions and go to the qmaster and buy a 16 slot bag. To do this you can just spam dungeons with the appropriate tabard on.
---
Relax buddy it was joke
---
TBC and then WotLK with #NoChAnGeS
---
15 minutes compared to 5+ hours? Use your head bro
---
I mean they released new races stuck behind a grind. The heart of azeroth is a grind. But no, you're right, because you get gold that changes everything
---
Hmm i only played vanilla - wotlk and i coulda sworn it started in bc. Pretty sure i had a character at level 60 with 14 hrs /played from recruit a friend, but i doubt i'll be able to look up their old promotions for it lol
---
Do you mean increased exp for leveling and questing or just the killing of mobs? I remember dinging a full level off a quest at around lvl 30.
---
I mean it has been close to 10 years for me so i could very well be wrong
---
You put it in the addons folder in your classic wow installation path.
---
Can we both at least agree that each other can go fuck themselves?
---
I just dont get why you would talk and all agree on a newer server. That's what we did...
---
If you played OG RuneScape then you'll probably feel right at home with classic. "Retail" is a more white knuckle experience. More action. Less RPG. As far as what was changed to get where WoW is now is alot of things. Off the top of my head it started with the removal of talent trees. Now it's just a point system you fill out as you level. No real flexibility. 
---
They introduced the "sharding" system which puts players on different quests in their own world. That along with the looking for group matchmaking system killed alot of the social interaction required to run higher level content. Some people love it ( me ) some hate it. Bosses and raids mechanics have become vastly more convoluted. The mythic+ system ( best thing to happen to WoW ) can be debilitatingly difficult. Many classes have been pruned and streamlined. Overall just a crap load of quality of life changes over the past decade that some players hate to love and love to hate.
---
I think if you have no viable addons that the game can detect the buttons doesn't show up.  I had the same issue until I moved stuff out of the folders and everything worked and the button started showing up.
---
I tried to play high but I fucked up so many quests lol. It took forever. There would be 3 quests together, I'd do 1 of them and go turn in, then I'd go do another one and turn in, instead of doing them all at once lol
---
I'm a level 18 hunter and just found out I had to be training my pet
---
Brilliant move
---
Wait until you guys discover large blue sack
---
Make them separate with an option to transfer *or copy* to the TBC server.
---
Agreed. And while Azeroth is held together by *glue and popsicle sticks* making flying impossible, the Outlands has many areas that are only flying-accessible.
---
I work 10 hours a day and get home at 7 PM. If I waited to jump into queue when I got home from work, I *literally* wouldn't be able to play the game with my friends (which has been the case for the past 2 nights). Sorry if my work-around upsets you and makes me a bad person - I just don't fucking care.
---
Then they hack it later to make more money.
---
Im just started this game (happy so far) but im worried a bit if my PvPRP eu server will be popular as all this normal PvP ones :( I want a beefy populated server, hoping that RP part wont scary people from it :(
---
Spent an hour and a half grinding to make the Copper Battle Axe for my lvl 9 warrior in classic. When I finally made it I felt a sense of accomplishment that I never had in retail. I may be lvl 8 but I hit like a truck now.
---
Enhancement shaman is similar to ret I guess, 2H slow weapon is also a priority for both - slightly squishier but totems have some interesting mechanics to make up for it
---
Same! I have ran into countless guildies and names I recognize while levelling.
---
I read you can get them from the Twitch app. I read Curse Forge is good. I Googled Questie for classic and found what I needed. Installed it last night and got to just try it, works fine from my quick testing. Just checked Nexus and they have them, that's my favorite mod place and is what I'll be using. Good luck!
---
Sounds like you just aren't talking then. I've made plenty of friends in BFA. Stop exaggerating.
---
Mythics when we hit 120, Uldir, BOD, and now EP. I've made friends at each stage.
---
Should have done legion when it was there, it's not gated, it's old content lmao
---
No, but you don't have to grind islands, the 4 weekly is sufficient
---
Man I’m gonna cry now. Fortunately my character will be logged in when I get home from work to cheer me up.
---
I buff everyone who comes by me.
---
Same, just tryna finish my xroads quests
---
Fuck off you have no idea how it feels to be autistic now gtfo
---
It's the only way to compete. Other people are doing it too. You'll lose hours waiting for a quest spawn just for someone with a mouse macro steal it.
---
You don't have to play the game nor do you have to wait in any ques.
---
I don't know why you'd be banned for that.  That's the pattern pretty much every hyped-up game follows.
---
You seem like a real swell person.
---
^^^^^^^^/s
---
Damn, I wish. I don't like the Night Elf zone, never have
---
There's two people on Gehennas-EU that are level 42 mages, might want to add them to the list.
---
This is exactly how I feel. I started in wrath but have some memories of leveling up to 58 before it was changed by cataclysm. Hopefully getting someone to help with my paladin weapon quest at 20 will be easier this time around!
---
Okay, so the end result is the same except people have less options.
---
nah mate aoe grind
---
I would rather see hundreds of players running around than the odd few over and over again
---
Cool, thanks for the quick reply.
---
R A T T L E
---
Is this true even for something like mage that has to hard cast to kill things? I don’t know much about speed leveling.
---
people saying server pops will tank in a few months  aren't saying it wont be popular at launch, you dont know how big classic will be in a month or two, no one does.
---
I hope they learn from this mistake and dont try to make retail into classic and allow them to exist as two different game and revert the damn gcd changes
---
*RESIST*
---
Haha I see the confusion. I meant 21+ as a reference to the drink itself, or an alcoholic drink. I did not mean it as to the audience of this post. Sorry!
---
Surely it would have made more sense to allow free transfers to low pop realms.
---
Taking this a little far....😂
---
Haha “the girls” are my two cats :p
---
&gt;should be able to play their classes better
---
The coordinated burst damage of multiboxers is what makes them so strong. With 5 real people a healer or two might be able to keep up with the damage for a while because it's coming in part by part. With 5 Multiboxed Characters firing off their damage in the same second the healers can't react quick enough.
---
It's like counting down for Alpha Strike in eve online - even though some people in your fleet would've been able to fire another shot already (therefore having higher DPS) it's better to all fire at once, just so the enemy healers don't have a chance.
---
&gt; The only good reason I can think of, is the TERRIBLE character progression. As much as I am kind of a retail apologist for certain things, there's no excitement to levelling up in BFA.
---
You're not wrong, but I wonder how much of that is BfA's fault, and how much of it is simply due to following Legion, an expansion so chock full of progression systems nothing could have compared.
---
Thanks, will do!
---
Yes well I work alot and dont have free time til 11pm and I can only play for an hour and a half b4 I fear sleeping past 6am making me late to starting this cycle again so I plan ahead to make sure I can enjoy this game too if you are limited on time too I advise using a remote desktop app too they are easy to set up and plan ahead
---
If you  don't have an autocast, distract opposing groups casters with /duel
---
That’s so awesome!
---
I think you might want to buy some flowers just in case.
---
2 data points bro.
---
Wow set it because it took from the others and made it more casual. No xp loss on death. Gear never becomes useless. Flight paths to quickly get across the land. Ground mounts for quicker movement.
---
WITH INT ON IT!!
---
The issue is that the jokes has escaped and for many has become a fact, on top of that imagine seeing a condition that you live with being treated like something which it is clearly not over and over and over again? Would you be aggressive if someone with cancer found cancer jokes offensive? I personally wouldn't, because you can see where they come from.
---
2 weeks + 48 hours, genius.
---
thanks, it did :)
---
its not just classic, almost any hyped up game will lose players over the first few months
---
Really had a blast. Looking forward to a lot more world PvP!
---
Cause the current generation of gamers are different to the ones from 2004. They grew up on a different mentality, and won't accept what we consider to be normal.  
---
They will try out Classic WoW due to the hype, but don't expect them to have the patient to stay. This is the generation that grew up on microtransations.
---
Is okay brudda, jus wait till all da hordy boys be doin it too, ya?
---
&gt;I felt more joy looting +1 stamina one handed sword than my 445 bis azerite chest.
---
That hits so hard. I was in a VC run earlier, healing as a ret paladin, and things were going okay but we had some bad pulls on the boat and some longer-than-necesary runs back as some of us learned the nuances of vanilla mechanics. We ended up getting a full trash respawn right as we got to the last boss and our tank had to dip out. I'm not even mad though, because I managed to pull Smite's Mighty Hammer out of that run so it feels like a victory even if I have to go back tonight for the completion quest.
---
ElvUI
---
Downranking FB can be valid with frost/spell damage gear for less downtime but takes pretty specific situation. Also, the faster the cast the lower the damage coefficient so can't just go rank 1 spamming.
---
last night in Teldrasill, I pulled a nightsaber and a spider. I was fighting for my life, relying on every single Reju tick to survive. It was amazing.
---
Should I pick up swipe or is maul good enough until i get claw?
---
So cringe
---
You no take candle!!
---
Yeah I've been skipping some stuff so far, but I definitely like to have the stuff that directly makes a difference for sure
---
nostalgia bait? i guess, but i much prefer these older game systems to the absolutely on-rails, training wheels garbage that the current retail product has reduced itself to.
---
I’ll check em out thanks
---
Who joins the streamer server then complains about the queue?
---
Some people lack vision
---
Dont talk to me or my forsaken ever again
---
Real fat neet posting hours *
---
Why does when you do it matter? You're stuck waiting for dailies and weeklies either way.
---
I just made my first gold today level 15 :)
---
Dude, really?
---
GJ OP. Some people out there have even forgotten what exactly it was they missed, and they are currently running right past it
---
Https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/
---
I love it! I love classic, I love the community, I love your video and I love how we proved blizzard wrong with their opinion. I hope other companies are gonna follow their example and listen a bit more to the community instead of *just* trying to make money out of games
---
Just awesome
---
idk, as much as its easy to blame BFA, there's also blame on Legion because they kinda designed a really crazy system with 0 exit plan for the next expansion
---
Actually I have been beat up for being autistic, literally so, your point is legitimately invalid.
---
Yeah. Imagine people looking for groups to PT (Princess Theradras) instead of Maraudon
---
can't stop that, its the only defence players have from dodging the colossal goatfuck of a problem  blizzard created. 
---
They need to open free server transfers right now.
---
Hype will soon die off and there will be a lot more space
---
&gt;	2) Basically every race in Kalimdor is hostile to the Tauren as well.
---
Because they make the best steaks.
---
Christ another phone pic
---
Oh my mistake, i thought you were manually searching the area for nodes (i was until i was reminded find minerals was a thing)
---
Could always wait for free transfers down the line. This way you don't lose the progress.
---
Nah man you’re all alone on that server
---
Because millions have already experienced vanilla?
---
unless you a paladin player
---
Doesn't make something timegated though
---
Keanu is the new Chuck Norris?
---
rank 1 for when you need to get the slow off, max rank after that
---
1) It's alright to not have much experience with the game, but would suggest starting off as a mostly social/levelling dungeon to begin with until you've gotten to grips with it more.
---
2) You honestly don't even need a forum or website. A lot of the larger or more well known guilds have those but they aren't required by any means, discord will do well enough until your guild gets big and even then you probably won't need it. If you really want a website for it then again wait until you're further along to start looking much into that, you should make a site if it's needed and going to be used not just because you want one.
---
3) I actually don't remember. 
---
4) Yeah, you not only can but should if you're inexperienced. The guild leader doesn't need to be the leader of all aspects of things, you can have someone in charge of recruitment - another in charge of helping low level peeps - another as a raid leader/organiser etc. Only works when you have sufficient members but you can start small and just rely on what people are good at. There's 0 issue with having someone you trust in charge of raids within the guild.
---
BFA had good leveling, the raid are pretty good but not groundbreaking but definitely a step up from Legion raids, the dungeons are pretty mediocre definitely a step down from Legion. I enjoyed the Nazjatar and Mechagon zones though. Other than those things pretty much everything else is garbage. WoD at least had amazing raids something that was very clearly great among all the nothingness. BFA just just slight 'its okayish' parts.
---
Would've also kept the spawn zones less inhabited on launch,  but idk,  as someone who didn't resub until it launched,  I like doing /who (lvl) to see who the highest character is
---
r/woosh
---
No, that is why I am asking.
---
I had one of these today. I got disengage on my hunter this morning and a mob surprised me a bit later. I hit disengage and was really confused why my character didnt move.
---
Totally forgot it was an aggro drop, not a movement ability.
---
If you leave the logged on character on, you can just log in from new computer and it should just let your right through que
---
I can't get aux to work  for me strangly. I even get an Error message regarding my Addons but nothing specific
---
Took us 3 hours of corpse running to get here with all our gear breaking along the way and leveling to 3 just from exploring along the way. Was the only option left with not even the level 1 boar quest being doable from all the people trying to do it. Was a fun journey
---
May I recommend the bootleg boy? Artists make songs with cartoon samples and upload them to his channel and they’re the bomb
---
As a rogue I /wave or /cheer or /lick every class that gives buffs and just pray they give me one. I find the pallies give me might quite often but it doesn’t last as long, sometimes I get fort and it makes me happy
---
Imagine taking the context in account.
---
haha thats awesome!
---
How did you kill a yeti!!
---
You are a god
---
both of those players should leave the server and not contribute to the problem
---
Which server are you on?
---
How do priests fare in PvP? I value being durable quite a lot, as in being really hard to kill even if this means you forego other things like mobility or even healing output.
---
Also what's up with Disc Priests in classic, is that a thing? I like the idea of Disc priests since they feel like a pretty unique style of play on it's own right.
---
I'm liking the idea of Priests too now that I'm looking at spells more closely, I forgot about Mind Control, Dispel Magic looks really strong and shadow priests I read are quite awesome, if I ever feel like DPSing in the future.
---
Meanwhile I've been dced 3 times and had to requeue every time. Firemaw.
---
hell most new characters start with four 16 slots
---
la dee da, take a look at mr money bags over here
---
Alt + f4 is the key combo to open the new flightpaths
---
Im leveling a tauren war too. Its amazing how the community so quickly adapted to, well how to put it. They actually act like a community. Peopke giving ithers greens they have found.  The people are willuling to help with just about anything.  Its also nice to see the chat being used. Even if there are some doofus sayinfmg dumb shit. I still love to see people actually talking and interacting.
---
Funny of you to say that, because I went to IF to take a screenshot for this post, but it was much emptier.
---
I believe you can do /cast and then shift click the Wand ability from your spellbook. I may be wrong, I only have used this for melee classes and hunters. 🤔
---
he should get a free sub for life simply for being the voice of thrall
---
Yeah... I mean.... I \*want\* to like Classic but I just don't have the time. 
---
During classic, I was in high school, without extracurricular activities, unemployed, and too lazy for AP/Honours. I \*still\* barely had the time to raid, or just do... a few things and that's it. 
---
Now I'm 30. I'm lucky if I get 2-3 hours a \*day\* to play. I need to get something \*done\*. 
---
Also I just kinda miss the ability to \*deal damage\* as a Druid. (Yeah, once the one night stand is over... everyone's gonna abandon their druids when they realise some ding-dong forgot to make Druid actually \*perform\* as a hybrid.)
---
Please don't eat me after I wave to you.
---
Bad stats
---
🦀🦀🦀 15 dollars to sit in queue 🦀🦀🦀
---
Totally believe that you sat at your computer for 8 hours straight, Waiting on queue
---
Wasnt the warrior the only class that couldn't solo elites in vanilla?
---
Yeah IF will still be the hub. It’s easier to navigate than SW and it’s proximity to Blackrock Mountain and Menethil Harbor will solidify that for sure. The only raids that aren’t closest to IF are ZG and AQ. MC, BWl, Menethil to Theramore for Ony, Naxx in the Plaguelands. It just makes sense that it’ll still be the hub.

You’re choosing to play on that server. How is that Blizzards fault?
---
Account sharing but offline for 7+ hours to sleep? Nah
---
Commit a significant portion of the revenue surge from Classic launch into rewriting the backend. This work could also be used in retail or a future MMO to keep the genre alive and true to it's name.
---
Yep. My mate who waited only played 15 before DC.
---
Another mate got home from work, jumped in queue, and got in less than 3m later due to server DC. He's literally joined at 5pm and waited a total of less than 20 minutes to play, over the first 2 days. Dude should buy lottery tickets.
---
Alright thanks. I'm in Goldshire now, so I'll work towards that
---
I disliked most of Legion, hated all the dungeons. Suramar though was really well done, the nightborne masquerade story was cool, sneaking around the town "Something's not quite right..." etc. The big killer for me was that I started a month late--and due to artifact "knowledge" being locked, I knew I couldn't ever keep up no matter what I did. So it literally made the game pointless for me to play.
---
Must be nice
---
What about that server pride that everybody loves so dearly? What if you had your perfect name on one server but lost it in the new server? Guild names?
---
Every melee class was fairly gear dependent due to weapon skills and weapon dps.
---
Yeah I've been levelling tailoring with supplies from quests and giving away the bags etc for free. Be the community you want to see etc.
---
I've never enjoyed a game so much in my life
---
hunter was my first lvl60, and i loved it... until i hit 60. levelling a hunter i found really fun very good solo, but max level pve i found very dull and quickly changed to a druid and levelled that to 60, (i always play on a pve server and dislike pvp so i can’t say if level 60 hunter is fun or not at pvp)

---
They’re gonna backtrack the shit out of that statement or content draught the shit out of people until they quit on their own.
---
If they're botting or otherwise exploiting this game, then yes. Ban them.
---
You should be able to do this, I've done it before with my keyboard macro keys.

It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
---
"Champion of the Alliance" my level 8 Priestess of Elaine wields a 5 pound hammer and a 10 pound longjaw mud snapper in her off-hand.  She looks like a nun that bakes the communion wafers for church services, which makes sense considering her level.  It  makes me feel like she is an organic part of the world rather than a big damn hero which honestly makes the adventure more interesting to me.
---
wow-petopia is your friend
---
Also curious, hopefully before I choose to roll this weekend.
---
Judging off of this post you'd want spell damage gear, the blazefury medallion, Maelstrom and some other proc trinket and then the pummelers to have a decent "base" speed for righteousness that gets inflated by the use effect?
---
I think so, as we start moving out of the starter zones the cap can be raised to allow more into them
---
grey handling imo, but i don´t know how to activate it!
---
Is it worth to play on such a massive server? I did 15 min que and played 10 hours today on a medium populated server.
---
They'll be begging you for money later.
---
So about this whole "layering gone by phase 2 thing" lol
---
I don't envy Blizzard. There was only one way to do this correctly, and it would require seeing 6 months into the future
---
No matter what they did it wouldn't be good enough unless they got the number exactly right the very first time
---
just pick one for fucks sake
---
same issue both days so far. it seems like it bring you down after a  mass disconnect but you get stuck until you catch up because everyone is logging right back in.
---
then it sits at a number and goes up 1, down 1 over and over its maddening.
---
There is a rumour going around that Leshraque is account sharing so I'd say it kinda makes his run unfair. He went to sleep and closed stream and woke up with +5 levels. He doesn't show playtime and doesn't stream the whole run.
---
I can't wait to go back there. Good memories of summoning so many people to their death in that deep water pit.
---
I got in 2 hours quicker today than yesterday
---
I imagine that it counts your place as soon as people DC, but since they put in the grace period, that number isn't accurate for big drops as people are getting back in?
---
the differences between retail and classic is worthy of discussion, it’s only when we play the same note over and over that it gets old
---
Fair.
---
&gt;Naturally a lot of people will quit in the next month, but even 15K in phase 2 will be insane in one server.
---
Everyone says this but I'm not so sure.  Classic is unlike anything Blizz has ever done. It is *like* vanilla, but it is definitely not vanilla.  
---
The people who are playing classic right now haven't simply stumbled onto a new game that they are going to try out.  Nor are they logging in to see if they enjoyed the new expansion.  
---
Classic players know exactly what they are getting into, and won't be disappointed because they already know the product inside and out. Many, if not most, classic players prefer classic to retail and they have pined for it for so long that they will continue playing classic long after they would have lost interest in retail. 
---
I'm sure that some people will get annoyed that there aren't flying mounts and tokens and will stop playing classic.  But I think that will be the exception rather than the rule. I think classic will have a very strong subscriber base for a very long time.  And then when they start to lose interest eventually, it will be just in time to roll out Classic + BC.
---
*hop hop hop*
---
Lets just call Classic "Vanilla" and Retail, "hell". 
---
Since both are technically retail now.

Lmaooo
---
I too experienced that but only with the camera movement and only in Beta. I am still not sure how if it just fixed itself or that I was playing with the setting too much in the Beta...
---
They are the lowest dps of all the pure dps classes, but they have tranq shot so you still bring some to even an optimal raid group. They have a high skill ceiling in pvp and are straight beasts in world pvp, especially while leveling
---
To be fair, Runescape quests are all mini stories that can take hours of your time to complete. Some of them connect to other quests and are quite appealing to play through due to their scale. 
---
WoW's quests while leveling are ultimately simple gathering and slaying quests with some flavor text until the near maxed level quests and attunements.
---
Your comment sums up the classic experience
---
Heres a list of zones by level, you can use this as a guide on when to move on https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level
---
Meh, I like it
---
How was the server performance? Not your fps, but the actual ping / delay. 
---
Anything even remotely close to this on retail results in horrendous lag.

Pressing left ctrl while bags are open will now flash the cheapest grey item in your bags so that you can easily find the cheapest item in your bags to delete if your bags are full and not close to a vendor
---
Did you report the people that were doing the exact same(probably automated) activity 3 hours later? That's the only way they'll actually be held accountable.
---
If you make a report in good faith given the circumstances I'm sure the Game will be understanding. Assuming they ever have time to respond, of course.
---
I would never do something like this...unless it's a large thorium vein.  Cause arcane crystals&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ethics

No, I left it open while I did homework. As soon as I left I was at que number 1900. I cant believe this happened to me.

---
Yeah really not hard to change these to become hard to detect lol easier solution is continuing to increase server capacities for the time being. People wouldn’t need to resort to this to ensure they’re able to play the game at a reasonable hour rather than be in queue for 5 hours
---
Another crybaby Asmongold hater. Let him play, and enjoy Classic.
---
That's not automation, it's mimicking keystrokes, which is perfectly within the TOS. A human is pressing the button, it's just pressing the button for every account at once.
---
Sshhhh, that's a promise I will allow to be broken. Don't speak of it !
---
If he is the same level as you he wont get experience until you get another level.
---
I wonder if this info just outright killed OP.
---
I feel like im in a pretty good spot. Virtually no life, a job and I play wow. Time to start saving $$.
---
I should have mentioned it's just a camera problem. Menu sense is fine.
---
Cool thanks
---
Found Brack's alt reddit account.
---
That worked. Thank you. I didn't expect it to be easy since it's a 20 year old game, but I didn't know how to separate items in the first place.
---
This is all I want in a game. Raiding. I played during Legion and raiding is honestly some of the most fun game experiences ever, but god did everything else suck. My friend wants me to join him in playing in BFA, and I'm hearing the raids are still amazing. However, I'm really worried about the gear slog, titanforging was the bane of my fucking life. So was world quest griding, azerite traits/AP (they're basically the same right?) are a pain in the ass. But god is raiding so good, and that's not something you'll get in classic. I don't know what I want to play.
---
Tanking may be a challenge. Healing and dps is a blast
---
Hahaha this is gold! 
---
Had 2 Small Black Pouches drop as a level 3 gnome... exclaimed in /1 "guess this is my main now!"
---
Honestly I finally put it together why I was seeing people continuously running into corners or people jumping up and down, and I’m definitely gonna do this myself. 6 pm eastern time is the perfect time to play for me but the queue is usually 14k by then so it’s impossible :(
---
Good for you man. I actually am in a Help Desk type job now but I also do Application/Software Support and get to work with some of the devs and engineers. My goal is to advance in my role and get more into the development side of things
---
If someone gets kicked out of queue, it doesn't bloat the queue. If there are 10000 people ahead of me, and they ALL afk on the login screen, at MOST that would bring the total queue back up to 10000+however many people were behind me. The same as if they didn't get in at all, which, they didn't. And this assumes blizzard automatically puts you back in the queue. Which, I would guess it does but don't actually know for sure. I just log in when I know people aren't playing and play until I go to work. Easy peasy.
---
No. Chris metzen is a blizzard og, and if nothing else, you know him as the voice of thrall and various other characters.
---
Shaman for raiding and dungeons was less effective than paladin, but for PvP, the old 2handed Windfury was a thing to behold.
---
About which topic? Joana’s original success, how he blew his money, his business plans this time around?
---
yeah totally would rather start a new toon then play on the server that I've already played on for 16 hours and have bunch of friends there :////
---
Do it. It’s a good time.
---
Oh no
---
Whatever personal value you give it, is how important it is.
---
Nope, you can use sword to level if u want. Just keep in mind you need to go back and get weapon skill up on daggers before you pvp. 
---
My buddy likes to use a quickswap macro to swap in a sword during pvp. That's more complicated then im able to do though.
---
A guard in any major city can direct you to profession trainers, among other things
---
Wow is for losers. I can’t even imagine posting about it online, unless I was into lady boys etc
---
I assure you we aren't.
---
&lt; Mage. I threw an arcane  intellect onto a lock as I ran past and paid no more attention. Then he chased me half way through the barrens to give me a healthstone. :)
---
Literally me
---
Yes this guy works well
---
Legendary
---
Glad you gave it a try.  Pop back in once in a while and pick up a toon to work on.  :)
---
Hope you have fun.
---
That's a bit disingenuous. There have always been a number of people who make it to max level in any given expansion and don't have a clue how to play well. Classic doesn't really teach you anything, it just requires a lot more determination and/or stubbornness.
---
&gt;In classic, running the low level stuff takes coordination like you don't see in retail until mythic+
---
It definitely does not.
---
I stay buffing mages for that Int buff. I always have on one :)
---
Still can't believe I joined Incendius worried it was gonna be underpopulated since it was so new. Now its one of the most populated servers in the game.
---
That's not software gore... That's just a lot of people wanting to play WOWC.
---
I got kicked out if eu queue after a 600 min wait and then had to start again. Fucking bs.
---
It certainly lands in a weird grey area that's for sure. Such a dog act doing it in classicn with the queues being crazy
---
For what it's worth it's completely legal as per Blizzard ToS for a legal guardian and a minor (up to 18 years old) to share the same account. Not saying that is the case, but it could definitely happen that a parent and child could level 24/7 until they hit 60 and create the biggest drama fest known to WoW.
---
Probably, everyone else was ranged, had heals, or CC.
---
Still, few did so as well as Rogues.
---
The key to avoiding Q times is to be in Korea and play  on a US server! That way when you get off of work its 2AM server time and you have no wait! Past two night I've got right in, no problem! 
---
...I have no clue what I'm going to do this saturday when its peak hours when I get up though.
---
Go for it 
---
hell idc I am paying for the sub 
---
And I am sorry but I will not go back into a 15k que whenever I need to cook/ buy grocerys or whatever 
---
The ppl that don't understand that are probably stuck in there
---
&gt;Probably have their PR team figuring out how to break the news that layering isn't going away... ever.
---
Easy.  "We will be removing layering Soon^^TM".
---
You can't complain about a game not being challenging if you're deliberately avoiding the challenging content though.
---
Sometimes a logout can refresh it.
---
They aren’t very good at learning or at trying. 
---
I gave my dumbest friend very very clear instructions and used dungeon tactics (tagging mobs with the shapes) and told them what to do and it worked a lot better, though - maybe this game will be different haha
---
Thankfully I'm working most of the weekend. Probably wont miss much lol
---
I have been saying this since launch and yall just can't seem to wrap your heads around it. 
---
queue's have NOTHING to do with total player demand.
---
NOTHING
---
The ONLY two numbers that have ANY Impact on queues is maximum concurrent players, and the number of players allowed to create characters on a server.
---
Period.
---
And blizzard set both of those numbers arbitrarily.
---
The queues are a 100% artificial problem.
---
The only number affected by total player response would be number of realms, which they have stated over and over and over again they can spin up at will.
---
Queue's exist because the modern blizzzard team either *want* them, or because they can't to subtraction, nothing to do with player interest.
---
There seem to be quite a lot of Spaniards on Firemaw. I only met one Hungarian besides us though.
---
Somehow I've managed to avoid queueing entirely every time I've logged in over the past 2 days on Ashbringer server EU...
---
Position goes up and down
---
ElvUi works
---
They've tried to make rewards feel big and flashy instead of... rewarding.
---
Who cares if you got Ashbringer, you got it just for logging in. So did everyone else.
---
15 years of progress..
---
Never stepped into a raid other than LFR.

I have the same issue and have had it in the private server i played before. Sometimes when i rightclick my mouse even without moving, my camers just goes somewhere.
---
You can but you need to pay for another account
---
I wonder if a more physical method of auto clicking could be banable? Like if I built a tiny machine arm to tap a key every x seconds but not actually have injected software.
---
Don't be dramatic, it's not an arbitrary line and you know it. Neither of those people are playing the game and therefore should yield their spot to someone who's waiting to play
---
I hope he sees this. You deserve to outed for your stupidity :)
---
who won?
---
Wouldn't you?
---
It is definitely a classic thing, sometimes you get lucky on retail but out of the 15+ characters I've leveled since Cata I've made maybe 3 friends from questing total. You don't need anyone for any quests, hell in retail you don't even need to be in groups to share tags, there is no reason to group with people realistically, no reason to care about any gear, bags, or anything tbh. This means no one is selling greens or handing out profession items since there is no point in even making them or taking the time to train the profession.
---
People definitely exaggerate how 'gone' the community is in retail but they definitely aren't wrong in the fact that Classic has 100x more of it. Since Classic release I've already made 7 friends and helped many many people, which is already way more than I've interacted with people while leveling in every xpac since wrath combined.
---
I definitely remember fishing there in BC but I can't confirm for vanilla.
---
This server is full now dammit why’d you say this
---
You need to be in an inn or major city
---
&gt;what people are saying is that for anyone that isn't doing M+15 and mythic current content, there is not challenging nor rewarding.
---
So what they're saying is that the stuff they could, but choose not to do, doesn't count. Alright then.
---
&gt;In Classic (and BC and early Wrath) most content is challenging and presents it's own rewards (either in terms of items or just the realization of how much more powerful you are than you were 3 levels ago).
---
I mean, not really. The only hard thing in Vanilla/Classic is the leveling.
---
You may remember the raids as being hard, but trust me once the good guilds starts steam rolling them you'll see how trivial they really were.
---
Still, I don't think that's software gore.
---
I was talking in gchat about how I was leveling fishing and taking a break from the insane crush of people leveling and one of the warriors joked that if I was leveling cooking I'd be his best friend.  Turns out we're best friends now.
---
I feel like everyone is being super friendly to everyone except for me haha
---
So far I've, tossed my last heal to save a priest from dying..who then stood and watched me die rather than either tossing a heal with his slight mana or helping me hit my mob.
---
Had people let me die so they can tag the mob.
---
People refuse to group and thus make us both struggle on a hard quest
---
People not buff even when I buff them
---
Not Res if i die next to them (including someone who i reader)
---
Overall I'm having a great time, I'm just missing all that classic love... Others on my server seem to be getting it too... Maybe it's just me :( lol
---
I never once said anything about remote desktop so idk why you bother responding to me with this. I have no problem with remote desktop connecting to get into queue because the person still has to manually input shit to do it. 
---
Maybe try actually reading my post before writing a while diary page?
---
Huh, so that's why Metzen always had such a thrall boner
---
Yes 1000000%
---
There's a lot of hate on multiboxers.
---
First of all, these sick 20-man multiboxers, they won't be around. They multibox in BFA, and probably made level 1 toons in classic to show off, because why not, they were already paying for all those accounts in the first place
---
Here's why
---
There is absolutely no reason to multibox in vanilla. There's very little to gain from it. You can't do BGs, unless you plan on losing. You can't mass pick herbs in classic, or ores, or anything else, there's one herb, then it despawns after being picked once. You're useless in raid, nobody wants you. There's no special mob that requires multiboxing in order to kill for phat loot, and there's nothing you can mass farm that one frost mage can't do. 
---
Multiboxers are a rare sight. I haven't seen one in several years. If you see someone testing out 3 shamans, its not because its overpowered or pay 2 win, because it's not. He's most likely just testing out things and having fun.
---
So please, stop spitting on them.
---
There's a lot of people playing now who won't be playing in a couple months. No way this game keeps up the numbers it's hitting right now.
---
No marker is awesome.
---
Yes, without a doubt.
---
BFA should just end with Azeroth getting hit by a giant meteor, and the gods are only able to save a portion of the game. Everyone goes through the launch event and blacks out at the end to wake up at level 60 and a note in your one bag that says, "Maybe we've been given a second chance". Retail then becomes a continuation of wow classic, but in a new and better direction.
---
I still have mine from classic, BC, and WotLK, after that it was just digital download.
---
I'm guessing a solid 50% will not make it to 60.
---
True, there's a lot of twitch-style memes in chat so it seems like most people are modern newcomers caught in the hype, so it should become better when those tourists have quit the game...
---
Been awake for 32 hours now and this happened to me multiple times.
---
You can ask a guard for directions!
---
Well not timegated in the sense of the other bullshit they put behind months of waiting. But having to spend weeks worth of grinding to access a part of the game you're paying 15 a month for definitely is getting gated out by time
---
I mean, they honestly aren’t needed at all. I was just seeing if op gave it thought to the fact that it’s easy enough that those add ons aren’t needed.
---
Just our names / class ... Which is refreshing for once
---
There's a shitload of people willing to wait hours and hours in a queue just to play it. You should know the response you're going to get from this community.
---
I think it would be kinda cool if they added some of the core elements from BC, WotLK, and Cata (except not change all of Azeroth for Cata) but not as expansions. I.e. the new races and starting areas and raids, but make the loot drops be new varieties or options of weapons and armor, instead of complete replacements. Find a way to keep vanilla raids and dungeons still desirable and not outdated.
---
Maybe create a macro? Put it on your action bars.
---
/thank
---
Select the person who buffed you and hit the macro. There are a number of different emotes you could use instead. Salute, Thank, Wave, Love, Kiss, Kneel.
---
Every wow player playing the game here is obviously going to say yes. You'll get the answer when you play the game and figure that out for yourself.
---
Is $14.99 and less if you pay in lumps of 3 months
---
you shouldn't go away pls
---
so far its been more normal PvE (like Aerie Peak in its heyday, for example). Unless a LOT of people start RP-ing with names like Icutyoux and Billymays, Im guessing its going to stay that way.
---
What I’ve noticed is that it gets worse around 2 and I figure it’s because people will leave the game or change realms more when the que is high and if you have sat through 5 hours to finally be inside 3k nothing will get you to leave
---
yup. i tried queueing well in advance and am still sitting in queue. it's pretty shite at the moment
---
These guys are playing with fire and exposing themselves to strokes or ictus.
---
I’m so glad my server was like this.
---
We had some carebare try that line crap and we just ignored him.
---
Fucking carebare servers. Only the strongest will survive.
---
This is a software papercut
---
2004: ChuckNorris 
---
2019: Keanu Reeves
---
/facepalm the numbers are irrelevant.  Layers are fractions of servers not multiples.
---
That’s a heart warming story! I think that’s something that Blizzard doesn’t realise - we need to need other people. A huge part of the appeal of WoW was exactly that.
---
I can’t believe ur mayo left ass loves tim pool so much, but w/e floats ur boat bb 😘
---
If I don’t have any int gear can I still solo heal in dungeons? I feel like I’d run out of mana. I’m pretty new so I could be wrong. Is there normally 2 healers?
---
Sorry for the late reply, but no. Simply download the mod and run the game. Your addon list will say if it is active and up to date.
---
Yeah there's nostalgia because its an amazing game to play and that hasn't changed.
---
Retail sucks poopoo and doesn't even benefit from any nostalgia factor.
---
Seems like a double win for Classic.
---
If a lot of people are doing it then it's OK
---
I read this in his voice, thank you.
---
How can they possible sell you gold? No one has any
---
14.99 USD, I'm in Canada.
---
/cast !shoot
---
Others may have a better answer, could never level a pally.  But priest are very fun in pvp and have more tools I think.  But having plate armor is a huge plus in pvp survival.
---
Well, you see, you first need to get your net neutrality artificial intelligence to data mining your big data with actionable analytics in order to get your machine learning to do voice recognition and personalization. Once you get your open source blockchain setup, you can then mashup your end-to-end algorithm to go viral and transition into internet of things by deep learning your data mining mobile virtualization.
---
Yep, just have fun your own way, some want to chill, some want to speed and that's the beauty of it.
---
6? Let's be realistic, you don't need all 6 pally buffs on a raid. Wisdom/Might are pretty much mutually exclusive, except for Ret Paladin and Hunters. Likewise, I can't think of anyone who'd need both Sanctuary and Salvation.
---
Not sure what you mean by meme spec.
---
Agreed that SPriest are kind of "only 1 needed by raid" class, in PvE.
---
Also agreed that raw DPS output isn't everything, but in the end, it certainly still weighs in the decision a RL must make when building up his raid group.
---
If Ele Shaman can't bring anything the other 2 specs can (which is correct), then why isn't the same argument valid for Ret Pallies? What can a Ret Pally bring that Holy Pallies can't? That's where I see a contradiction. I mean, there's Sanctity Aura...
---
Like Arcane Mages and Ele Shammys, Oomkins fit the description of going OOM after 30 seconds and being useless thereafter, hence the nickname "Oomkin". I'll concede that Ret Pallies don't have that issue, but I don't see how Oomkins are any different from Ele Shammys or Arcane Mages, except they bring that 3% spell crit buff, I guess, although they can Innervate themselves and last a little longer, but they still end up OOM before long fights are over.
---
It appeared to add quite a bit at first, but just logged on to Herod, 13k. If it's anything like before it only decreased by about 5k, effectively making the game still unplayable during peak hours. If the timer is to be believed it will take 5.5 hours to get in (1 am EST).
---
Yeah... so good on blizzard for making the effort but it's still sadly not enough.
---
&gt;Position in Queue : 4691
---
I think you should wait till next week ...
---
$20? It should only be $15 unless you were looking at a WoW token, which is technically game time, but is more of an in game commodity
---
As for whether or not it's worth it, I definitely would say it is at least for one month to give it a try, because if you end up not liking it, it's only $15 still, but if you do like it then well, it might be more expensive than that afterwards
---
Do you know of Hungarian community on Firemaw (ally)? I only know 4 of us. And what server would you suggest for Hungarian Horde (feels like 9th century already!) for alts? :D
---
Go at your own pace. You can always catch up.
---
You just need to get her to play with you. Us: "you log us in, I'll put the kids to bed...." we legit just took 2 days off in the middle of the work week!
---
I’m not at my PC currently but there’s two options to change the two rune colours, then there’s an option or two above them.
---
You need to fade one of those two options out completely.
---
Apologies for the vague description!
---
Aren't the t2.5 just armor class based recolours?
---
Well yeah, have you heard of remasters? Crash trilogy, Spyro, FFVII, Warcraft Reforged? Rereleasing old games isn't anything new and hasn't been started by Blizzard
---
I did say yesterday, 10 hours ago.
---

Those are layer crashes, it's not them adding layers.
---
I toss totems on people and watch as they pull everything to the totems for the next minute.
---
Temporary change to her name for this post lol
---
Consider how many hours it takes to get to a point where you can do mythic content. easy=boring, it’s not good design to gate the interesting content so far away.
---
Thanks!  
---
I saw some talents tree you posted and I decided what to do for leveling.
---
I saw one guy in a corner walking into a wall around 4 in the morning lmao
---
I mean I wouldn't even be pissed if blizzard made streamers with X amount of consistent viewers a special queue lol
---
I won’t tubbs 🙂
---
She doesn’t sound too happy about it but is willing to do it!  That’s love.
---
So how many people are playing Classic lol. Anybody seen any reports or anything?
---
k. We dont care.
---
Yea, it's like suffocating with no other bags until either buy one or one of those guys drop. So good.
---
True love right there lol
---
overpopulated starter zones isn't a good time man -\_-'
---
Used to be part of x-Perl unit frames, not sure if they have a wow classic supported one out or not
---
You probably mean ZPerl
---
Those aren't welfare epics. Think Trial of the Crusader in WOTLK. They added a whole raid that was much easier than Ulduar, and they awarded Tier 8 for doing enough 5 man heroic dungeons. Those are the welfare epics s/he was referring to.
---
Still got that and the big ass manual that came with it
---
Have you had stone Tangerine Express IPA,  shit is my go to lately.

Omfg I remember that video!!! Shit still has me laughing.

....I.... haven't been doing this all week.... Damn, it has been a while.
---
Stal is actually _slower_ this afternoon, with the exception of one short speed spike, it's the slowest it's been since launch.
---
Remote into your computer and get in the queue while you're working.
---
i played BC as horde but i dont remember this feller, who is he?
---
its not up to you to decide which xpack should get a rerelease. if peope want a "classic" WoD, why would you want to hard stop it? having classic wod, pandaria or w/e other xpack rereleased is not gonna hurt you in any way, since you wont be playing it anyway. 
---
The whole "stop liking what i dont like" meme is getting really old.
---
Thank you. I read about something called zperl for classic
---
There’s no laws when you’re drinking claws.
---
Yea that's it bud.
---
&gt; Just don’t roll on the most popular server? My server is high pop and zero queues.
---
Agreed, I'm playing on the Oceanic PVE server and haven't seen a queue yet.
---
Me and my friend found out westfall stew sold for 1S each to vendor. So we farmed up enough mats to make 10 of them, split the silver and felt like entrepreneurs. It tripled our cash at that point lol.
---
Buying mounts with real money is the oposite of cool. The zulian tiger on the other hand... :)
---
Oh. I quit in WotLK because it was like playing on easy mode.
---
Lmao I have no q for whitemane, while all the other servers do.  Must be a bug
---
Sure has its perks being top lvler
---
As a druid i like buff trading and thanking people with a buff 🥰
---
Do you just turn on autoloot with it?
---
No. But I can make sure I don’t group with him for anything in the future
---
You mean Adept?
---
Yes, not too long after the blue post the Herod queue dropped 1k, then another and I got in after about 15 minutes I think (I was still around 3400).
---
It looks like whatever they did is now done and we're at the new cap/normal which is still unplayable. How am I suppose to play when I get home from work and the queue is at 13k? I can't wait till 1 am.
---
If you do that, you will effectively kill wow. Player bases will be split into so many different forms of the game.

Having played a druid end-game in vanilla, I agree with the other comment.  In raids they are there to innervate priests and off-heal.  Prior to raiding, they have a little more flexibility.  Druids are a flexible class.  I remember doing all druid Dire Maul runs.  Properly geared, they can tank, DPS, and heal moderately well.  Pre-raid 5mans can be a lot of fun and you can find yourself shifting in and out of your different animal forms often.
---
Raid gear is almost all for healing.  Feral gear is pretty limited to pre-raid blues you have to fight with rogues over.  You will have a tough time being an effective raid off-tank or coming close to competing with raid rogues in DPS.  Modern WoW is vastly different than vanilla.  
---
There are some rare circumstances in AQ40 where you might offtank as a druid and the raid gear is more hybrid, so there is that.  The PvP gear, if you can get it, is also an option for feral.  
---
Speaking of PvP, druids can be pretty effective since they are so flexible.  A well played druid in PvP can be hard to kill and be excellent support.

Tangerine is awesome, I'm actually been leaning on the Tiki Summer sample pack, which has Tangerine, Scorpion Bowl, Double Ruination, and the exclusive Vengeful soul. They're all pretty good.
---
Lmao, they will never ban their free advertising machine
---
I had my internet go out last night when I’m queue and when I went back within a couple min I got sent back to my queue spot. It’ll first show u the back of the queue and then you’ll jump forward. 
---
I just did this again by turning off my wifi and then turning it on in queue so you can just do that and it’ll work.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames works with classic. It is what I use.
---
I'm certain you're referring to Lua Unit Frames (LUF).
---
If you think this is going to die down. You haven't been paying attention
---
To be fair they were woefully unprepared. Sat in the queue, was in 97,899th place. Idk the accuracy of that tool, but damn. Was in the queue for like 6 hours I think, I left it on while I went shopping, and even mowed my grass before it popped.
---
lol
---
&gt; The reason I say they won't give out game time is cause of Activi$ion
---
They won't give out game time because you don't understand the difference between the publishing company Activision and the holding company for Blizzard, Activision, King, et al, Activision-Blizzard?
---
Love being a rogue jist to grab items and chest and quest mobs faster while a hunter is cleaning the room or something.
---
I like how we are getting downvoted, this is a toxic community lol
---
I disagree. I want Classic to be the same cultural phenomenon it once was, I really do. But I just can't see how all these people will be sticking with the game. Some are here to try it out, some came back to check it out, some are retail subs who won't bother.
---
I find the lack of Chuck Norris jokes displeasing.
---
I saw the same thing, I’m thoroughly confused
---
Fucking trannies
---
My game feels something like this too. Cant figure it out either :-(
---
&gt;Rogue actually just wanted to free up bag space
---
Same thing just happened to myself, my buddy, and his GF. I was sitting at 11k in queue when he told me, left game and rejoined and instantly in
---
thanks chief
---
?? Yeah they do lmao. I transferred all my characters to Tichondrius years ago despite being not just  'Full" but also like the second most populated server in NA
---
"Full" is just an indicator of realm pop. It's not a lock or anything like that
---
Don't blame him for Blizzards oversight
---
We aren't even to the weekend yet. So many people are going to be playing this weekend that even with this it's going to be touch and go.
---
I work full time, and haven't had too many hours to play yet. But this weekend? I'm preparing for the biggest, most epic gaming session I've had in 10 years.
---
A random priest saved my life last night with a clutch heal as they ran past. I tried to give them intellect but they ran off in to the sunset and never looked back.
---
Of maybe the booner came first, well never know :P
---
My logic is server cap is 12000, but that's too many all in a few places, so they make layers of say 500 people.
---
Eventually the 12000 are spread out, so everyone can be on one layer.
---
I'm almost there, myself. My sub ends around sep 11th so if there isn't a significant improvement I may just cancel it until Blizz gets their shit together.
---
It's frustrating, but you either keep competing for the first hit (I hear a /target attack macro is more useful than tab-spamming), or come back later when there's no crowd.
---
I am not angry, I am just saying if a majority of people call it a duck, noone gives a shit that you call it a moose... Its still a duck.
---
Yeah but we actually like Keanu unironically and he's relevant.
---
Chuck Norris was already washed up and forgotten when he became a meme (forgive me father).
---
It's simple: reddit encourages populist contrarianism.
---
Keanu Reeves finds an Tel'Abim Banana. Keanu Peels.
---
I feel like the server dced and I got lucky or something. I mean The blue post about the cap increase was like 2-3 hours ago.
---
*cries in warlock*
---
Yes. can confirm. My buddy texted me "no whitemane queue?" while I am sitting at 3k currently. I told my other buddy who was at 9k to test it. He got in too. I wont risk it because I'm so close.... lol
---
wow, what i say is...my opinion?
---
God damn, i know leveling is 'hard' but it isnt $37 hard
---
Yep I missed the wand rush because of the queues. Probably would have made like 5 gold
---
I don't chill for shit.
---
China? :/
---
I sold some bones for 94 copper.  I was as giddy as a school boy.

Subscription based games are quite rare nowadays. To be honest I wouldn't throw that much money every month If I wasn't a fan of the franchise. People argue that subscription is the best way to maintain quality but we've seen a lot of good things in this f2p era
---
I can see that foreign talk show guy telling the story and laughing meme now. “And then I told them they can do it again, and just gave them back the SAME game for another 15 years!” (Wheezing)
---
I ain't no bitch. Let's punch each other in the face and see who dies first.
---
Drink moar wine lardo neet
---
The problem is Blizzard doesn’t know for a fact that things will be okay in a year. They need to see what the drop off is like, and go forward accordingly.
---
Ballista 43
---
I think it's fun, constant struggle for mobs, teaming up with randos to clear mines, finally grabbing Q items!
---
Yeah, I see your point. I think my biggest concern isn't really the game, but just the state of the world in general. I'm tired of everything being cynical and shitty to each other. :-/
---
BfA is far from perfect, but I still think it has some great parts. The zones, the story (Faction War aside lol). I friggen love Kul Tiras and Zandalar. I just hate to see people focus on only the bad parts, and forgetting the good ones. Blarrgh. I'm an old curmudgeon.

 No, it was the Power Rangers set.

All rare spawns have different timers some are 12 hrs and some can be 2 there’s guy on you tube who covers rare spawns and give a lot of info about them but hasn’t covered every single one thus far
---
If you could read I said we still would have got it without "you". As in you're nothing and don't speak for anyone but yourself.
---
I understand for back then
---
You're suggesting they put a time limit on how long you can remain logged in an playing? After 8-12 hours you get booted and sent back in line?
---
You haven’t seen at least 50 players standing in the same spot an hour later after finishing a bunch of quests? Because I sure have
---
I don't want it to go away again and I fear it inevitably will

&gt;6? Let's be realistic, you don't need all 6 pally buffs on a raid. Wisdom/Might are pretty much mutually exclusive, except for Ret Paladin and Hunters. Likewise, I can't think of anyone who'd need both Sanctuary and Salvation.
---
I was wrong about this. You only need 5 to cover all the majors.
---
"Meme" spec is what the internet calls anything that isn't a Tier 1 raiding spec
---
3% spell crit is the big anime tiddys tho.
---
I guess the stigma for Ret is a little different because they're not just standing there hanging out waiting for the boss to die unlike Boomkin/Arcane/Elemental. 
---
I mean, personally, I'm not the type of person who tries to "break the meta" by attempting to make something viable so I don't know this struggle.
---
Lvl 19 warrior I'm on 2,5g
---
Could have more if I sell green gear instead of giving it away
---
i put all my money in tube socks, doritos and mountain dew futures last week
---
my friends for whatever reason stuck with faerlina when asmongold announced he was playing there.  2 and 1/2 hours isn't bad.  I've been in queue for 4+ hours waiting to get on today.
---
plus side is I'm getting a lot of chores done while I'm waiting around.
---
I actually got buffed by a mage (Arcane intellect) on my rogue and I was thinking, what would intellect ever do for me.
---
Turns out, it increases the chance that my weapon skills will improve.
---
If I'll ever want to level up weapon skills aside from the sword/dagger (that I use for leveling), I'll specifically look out for intellect gear to speed up the process.
---
As a rogue.
---
Which is the addon for the bottom bar with some info?
---
97,899 holy crap!
---
Don't feel too bad, arcane missiles is doodoo anyway.
---
So? No one wants Blizzard to fail. What they want is for the lessons of WoW Classic doing well to affect change in retail moving forward.
---
Submit a ticket or give it a bit since lots of people are resubbing all week.
---
What a god tier void name. Lucky!!!!
---
Don’t sweat it. There will be guilds starting Ony even if/after they release a BC expansion again.
---
Get a pocket healer, peel for them and you're golden. I was a rank 13 gnome war in vanilla and I loved my pocket healers and protected them which resulted in a lot of glory...and fun!
---
Its a trap!
---
It was changed in Burning Crusade. I don't remember the patch # but I remember that healing threat was changed at the same time. It gutted healing being a mechanic that you had to think about to do well.
---
when they buff you while you're drinking and they run off, it's the saddest thing because i wanted to return the favor
---
ya, I have no clue how that works. So if someone just simply goes afk they WILL be automatically logged out?
---
Id save a few more hundred dollars. Anything really in that range should be fine
---
He's a dev. When battle for azeroth was in Beta that same picture was on walls of a few unfinished areas instead of proper textures lol
---
You don't need to look further than Wildstar to see how opening tons of realms to meet temporary demand is a bad idea. You just end up with a whole bunch of half-dead servers in a couple of months, and then even those that remain start leaving since an MMO without people isn't exactly fun.
---
I went rogue because I've never mained one before and when I can afford to do multiple respecs I'm going to go sub and do world pvp. Popping up and stun locking someone sounds so fun to me.
---
[my first thought](https://youtu.be/GZpcwKEIRCI)
---
I hope you get a life and find something else to do.
---
Back when ambiance and music actually meant something. Just walking up to siege engines and actually hearing them running instead of being dead in Kronos is amazing. Didn't realize what a bad job those kronos guys did until I saw the small things they missed.
---
Depend who you ask
---
There are lots of mice that come with software that is able to write and use macros. 
---
They can't people just because they have the Logitech/Razer/Corsair mouse software running. 
---
And there is no way for Blizzard to know its a macro or if im actually pressing the button.
---
I think BC and Wrath would be fine if Blizzard scaled everything back a bit, if that's even possible. Seeing sick gear in BC was cool, but dumping all my hard earned epics for a bunch of greens felt bad, man.
---
yes, lots
---
that's why im going to try to change my sleep schedule so that i wake up at around 5 am everyday, tired of these queues
---
That website is useless
---
Last updated 8/26 @ 10:08 PST. Arrows compared to 8:44 PST.
---
sorry for askng here, but what is this chat addon? and anybody know any WORKING and essential addons for classic? downloaded a bunch of addons and 2/3 of them are bugged or dont work at all... im so tired of this :(
---
God DAMN haven’t listen to Dota by Basshunter in so long!
---
I just logged onto whitemane instantly without doing this, no queue?
---
Man I wish my encounters were like that, I join silent groups doing a quest who just leave when it’s done.
---
Osrs is a sandbox mmo. Wow is a Theme park mmo. Runescape is a cookie clicker. Wow is not.
---
If you look up the definitions there is an obvious distinction between the two.
---
And thus doesnt work for shooting.
---
Thanks lol my buds and I got a kick outta it and we thought a GM was fooling around or something
---

---
That's Samwise Didier, Blizzard art director, whose face is used as a placeholder icon sometimes
---
Not to mention that once you have a main with literally any amount of money at all, you just mail your new alts 10slot bags
---
So yeah this has fuck all to do with BFA v Classic. It’s just starting a new character on a new server in a new game. 
---
If BFA launched from scratch today, getting a bag drop would be exciting too
---
Honestly, I'm tempted so say I wouldn’t be against Blizz doing random server resets to force people out. But that screws over plenty of others in the process. 
---
If more people stopped afk’ing, there is a chance more tourists will get in, get their fix and move on. Ultimately reducing queues.
---
Agreed.
---
It’s a rough feeling when you roll an alt after maining a mage. But in retail hearthstones are a lot shorter. I totally forgot it was 60 minute CD until Monday.
---
Some guildies are saying this, people in que might be bugged? Maybe they added more layering
---
Classic doesn't have difficult end game content? Ever done Vanilla MC with 40 men? Naxx? Gearing up for MC? Onyxia? 
---
Shit's hard, bro.
---
Raids are just as popular on pvp servers, especially at the beginning because battlegrounds won't become available for a few months.
---
Couldn’t they phase features out slowly? Each new expansion restricts flying as it is, could they not restrict LFD until Pathfinder 1 or something and see how it goes? Just to test the water. Restrict raid access (INCLUDING LFR) until a basic attunement is completed to see if something more complicated or involved might work for future raids. That kind of thing. Doesn’t have to be all-at-once make-it-Classic, just try some of the things out for a bit.
---
Dude, just go to a lower pop server and play! Don’t worry about it. Blizzard merged low pop realms back in vanilla days and they will do it again if need be. Also I’m sure they want to cash in on server transfers down the line since so many groups of friends have been split up. Enjoy.
---
Beacuse of hype, this’ll unfortunately keep going for sometime.
---
Uh oh we got an angry one
---
Are there no line of sight wireless providers in your area? My parents are out in the middle of nowhere and get 15mbps down from a LoS connection and it's pretty reliable, and there's no data cap.
---
4G is another option, but chances are you aren't getting very good cell signal where you're at either, this could potentially be solved with a roof mounted cell booster though. You will get throttled though after a certain amount though on any cell service in the US. WoW doesn't eat a lot of bandwidth though, so you could potentially stay under the cap easily.
---
PvP means player versus player, not private. Private means not owned by Blizzard.
---
I just like the feeling of going through Westfall questing geting killed left and right questing, USING the road to avoid danger, then doing 2 Deadmines Runs, get both swords on my rogue and the chest, that are like mega upgrade. 
---
Then go back to questing on the mobs that spit in my face, like "Remember me assholes".
---
A then continue to wipe the floor with them.
---
THe progression is there, you feel powerful. It's just awesome.
---
Okay looks like I'm camping thanks for the info
---
Haha yeah leveling a warrior is hard with a capital H but so worth it. You’re basically golden God’s end game.
---
What a messed up way to think...
---
For real. Took me a long time and a bunch of breaks to bust through the 30s in vanilla.
---
Really when I send a mail it auto completes with different realms
---
Well, almost. You have to run in and smack them with your big Axe every 3 seconds or so as well, then strafe away
---
Ya, like all other games the numbers will drop. Just, hopefully not too much.
---
Exactly this. I've played for 26~ hours so far and only been in queue for a total of 2 hours. Once queues disappear, I wont have to jump through hoops and the people currently stuck in queue can finally play.
---
100% warranted. If you are horde on kirtonos I'd love to know your name too
---
Not at all. Which given the “sky is falling” attitude this sub had towards it, I’m shocked.
---
That's awesome! I got a sentry cloak on Golemagg EU about 3 hours ago. None on the AH as I imagine people will be holding onto it for later.
---
4k was better than 16k cheers
---
In the laptop area of things, you’ll probably have to spend about $500 to $600 to run the game well. Save your money for a little while longer, the game will still be here when you get back.
---
LOL,
---
Got a queue 4 hours ago 11.5K and 230 mins.
---
Since then is has bounced as low as 9, 6, 3 mins, and back to 30,  then 60, then 75.
---
I saw a big jump at about an hour ago with 1k people dropping out, but I'm still at 3k and \~60 mins queue estimate.
---
He trades them a weapon.
---
I'm #365 but haven't moved I kinda wanna try this but feel it would backfire
---
Yeah that was a bummer, had to redo my whole spirit load out. Im sure it was less of a headache for them to balance
---
It's an add-on. Cant remember what its called, think it was Storyteller
---
Servers seem to have communities again.
---
I randomly encountered a priest three times yesterday and a mage two times today. The world may be big but a server is small.
---
Later on while fishing at Crystal Lake a dwarf randomly started a convo with me. We were just sitting there, fishing and talking. Then he had to go and I told him see you later.
---
And I'm pretty sure that we will (I remember the name).
---
As far as I remember pve wise it was.allowed but for pvp it's a banable offense
---
Stop repeating this. I have friends who quit WoW before I did, before Pandaria, or dipped back in and out for a while, who are trying desperately not to come back now but are. You underestimate the number of 30+ year olds who enjoyed WoW in hs/college/early 20s and then quit and are now going to re-sub. If anything, I feel like we'll see more subs in the next week or two or month even as people convince their friends to come back and play w/them.
---
I think I will want to get a good one in case I want to play games such as rust aswell?
---
Can I use AHK to hit a key for me every 28 minutes to stay logged in? I read the tos sounds like it could work, one key entry = one action.
---
I'll be honest as an Undead i'd rather not go see the Banshee queen. Pretty sure something will be wrong with her.
---
8 hours is 3-4 days for jobbers like myself, and thoae unfamiliar with the game may take longer/level professions on the way/etc
---
I'm just saying people hate giving up time invested
---
Esfand seems like a decent human being that enjoys gaming. I don't know him, won't profess to know anything else.
---
A guide that was finished and has been obsolete for 14 years is somebodies full time job?
---
&gt; Pisses everyone off
---
It'll piss off exactly the same number of people who are already pissed off about layering. Everyone else will just defend Blizzard like they always do and tell you to "stop whining".
---
Also, the class quests and crafting quests ! Having to choose between crafting gnomes or goblin explosion, or special druidic sets is awesome !
---
Did he need on things he didn’t need? Cuz if he needed them then needing is fine. Though back in the day it was mostly an unwritten rule to pass on blue gear if you already got a piece earlier in the run.
---
Aren’t the new servers they added gonna suck because a lot of established guilds aren’t moving to them?
---
Trolling?
---
Thanks for the tip. Someone tried to grab a chest i had attacked a mob to get to and i opened a trade after i killed the mob and got my battered chest, suck it uzuul
---
can anyone confirm for other servers?
---
To be fair, Cata introduced so many good quests, and then they ruined it by having world flying, heirlooms, and boosts.
---
I think they should expand upon the content. Not even raising the level cap or adding new races/classes but just not go down the “time to re release all the old expansions” road. 
---
I would love to just see new raids or new bg game modes. It’s strange to think that the end goal is to hit Naxx then kinda just question what will they do next. I realize that Naxx is by no means easy and won’t be cleared fast but maybe a story where since we are going back in time by means of Chromie, we get an alternate timeline where things stay, more classic for lack of a better phrase.
---
Just got instant q on whitemane. Huge fix?
---
Yes you need an active sub to install it.
